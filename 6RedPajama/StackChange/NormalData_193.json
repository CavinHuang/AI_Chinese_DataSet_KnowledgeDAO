["Q: I can't upgrade Kubuntu 14.04 to 14.10 I have issues upgrading Kubuntu 14.04 to 14.10, I looked up all the previous questions concerning this issue, but nothing helped.

This virus was proven to be impossible to be detected/removed by 50+ most popular antivirus programs/rootkits. What to do? Any alternatives to a complete hd wipe?\nHere's the deal: I've been having issues with a really strange virus on Windows 8.1 for several months now.\nAbout the virus:\n\n\n*\n\n*It plays a loop of a muffled voice through headphone/speakers at random times\n\n*I didn't hear this muffled voice for weeks at a time, but then it comes back\n\n*Disconnecting from the Internet and muting the sound does nothing to stop it\n\n*As far as I can tell, this virus does nothing but annoy, since my system runs as it should\n\n\nWhat did NOT help to get rid of the virus:\n\n\n*\n\n*I run 50+ (yes, really) different anti-virus/malware/spybots/scanners/rootkits on Windows 8.1 -- both in safe mode and otherwise, was a total waste of time\n\n*I run clamav/tk in Ubuntu 14.04, again this virus is undetectable by the large majority of anti-virus/rookits/etc\n\n*The refresh Windows 8 function: this doesn't delete the sys32 folders, but removes all programs\n\n*The factory reset from Windows recovery partition: did this 2 times... makes be believe that the recovery partition is also infected\n\n*Installing Ubuntu 14.04 on a different partition: the virus appears to have transferred and now I hear the muffled voice in Ubuntu as well\n\n\nAny suggestions what to do here? I don't have a Windows 8 installation CD, but I'm close to wiping and reformatting the entire hd and installing Ubuntu again. Sadly, I still need Windows and might thus need to pay up for a fresh Windows 8 CD (despite having Windows 8 on this pc, and Windows 7 on another pc!).\n\nA: Try running a linux live cd with the hdd/ssd detached. Maybe (as mentioned above) it's not a virus but a interference from another source. \n\nA: \nI've been having issues with a really strange virus on Windows 8.1 for several months now.\n\nWhy on earth would you keep using a system you suspect of being compromised? Antiviruses are supposed to detect. They are relatively poor at cleaning. If you think you've caught something bad and can't verify its complete removal, you backup your data and reinstall everything from known-clean media.\nRestoring from an on-HD Windows recovery partition is convenient but your computer (and any malware) can probably also write to that partition. Treat it as hostile.\nIt seems most likely that this is a hardware interference issue and nothing to do with software. As other people have suggested, I would strongly recommend running Ubuntu from a Live CD for a while. Use it how you would have used your Ubuntu but try to avoid using files from your regular install. This will help rule out hardware issues.\n\nA: Some cheap speakers lack appropriate shielding and therefore act as a bad radio receiver. That seems much more likely than the same software issue affecting two separate operating systems.\n\nA: This is not a virus.  Anyone who'd written a virus sophisticated enough to have the effects you describe (more than one operating system, undetected by any antivirus, no performance etc. effects on the infected machine) would not be using it to play muffled voices through your speakers. They'd be using it to steal information, probably from governments and large corporations. Using it for anything trivial like playing voices through your speakers would risk the virus being detected and compromised, which would waste the significant effort that would have to have been put into writing it. Unless maybe you're the head of your country's intelligence agency and the CIA is trying to make you go a little bit crazy? ;-)\nRadio stations often loop a short message or piece of music when they're not broadcasting actual content. Since you only hear the voice intermittently and it's not in your country's language, I would suggest that it's a distant radio station that the electronics in your computer are only picking up when atmospheric conditions are just right.\n", "Q: Black screen with underscore after drivers install I have problem with my computer (with ubuntu...). So, I'v (not?) installed NVIDIA graphic drivers, but (apparently ineptly) after reboot, I see loading screen, but later I see only black screen with underscore in left upper corner. :( I don't have access to terminal... (I can use him, but only sometimes for 1 second... after one second screen is black.)\nDo you have an idea how I can fix it? :/\nNVIDIA geforce 210, Ubuntu 14.04.1\n\nA: If you want to try to recover some files from your computer before attempting to fix or reinstall Ubuntu, boot from the Ubuntu live CD/USB and select 'Try Ubuntu' - you will be able to view the files on your HDD and copy them to a second USB.\nTo fix your video problems, there are two items that you can try:  From this answer, you can boot your computer with nomodeset as a kernel option.  This may be enough to make your computer work well.\nSecondly, if you want to remove the Nvidia driver, this answer has very good instructions, but you will need to boot to recovery mode first:\nBoot up the machine, and after the BIOS screen, hold down the left Shift key. You will then be prompted by a menu that looks something like this: \nI've noticed on some systems that timing when to hit the left Shift key can be tricky, sometimes I miss it and need to try it again.\nHit the down arrow until you select the 2nd entry from the top (the one with the recovery mode in the description) and then hit Enter.\nNow you should see this menu:\nUse the arrow keys to scroll down to netroot, the root shell with networking.  This will take a little time to open, but will get there.\nThen a series of 4 commands should be run.  The first removes the nvidia packages, the second re-installs the Ubuntu desktop (there is a package nvidia-common which is needed but removed in the first step), the third removes the Xwindows configuration files that were modified by the nvidia installation, and the last ensures that the stock video driver in not blacklisted.\nsudo apt-get remove --purge ^nvidia\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop\nsudo rm /etc/X11/xorg.conf\necho 'nouveau' | sudo tee -a /etc/modules\n\nFollowing this, reboot your computer with  sudo reboot\n", "Q: Install programs in other directories I have a PC with a 120GB SSD and a 1TB HD. I want to have Ubuntu and Windows dual boot. I am OK with this bit. The problem is that I want to partition the SSD in 2 60GB partitions and have one for Ubuntu and one for Windows. Now in windows I can install all the programs in the 1TB drive. In Ubuntu I don't know if this is possible or how it is done.\nFirst let me know if this is possible, easy to do and won't cause the system any malfunction. And then please, if it meets the criteria above, show me how it is done. \n\nA: \nIn Ubuntu I don't know if this is possible or how it is done.\n\nYes, it is possible. It used to be custom to do so when you use a server version. Instead of changing the location for MySQL to store its database you can simply mount it elsewhere and share different operating  systems with the same MySQL installation by mounting /var/.\n\nFirst let me know if this is possible, easy to do and won't cause the system any malfunction. \n\nYes, yes and no. Yes, it is easy when you understand how. No it will not break anything.\n\nAnd then please, if it meets the criteria above, show me how it is done.\n\nNow for the kicker: software installed in Ubuntu will go to directories like /etc, /var/ and /usr/. If you create a partition on the 1Tb and call it /etc/, /var/,  /usr/ all software in that directory will go to the 1Tb disc. \nYou can stop reading here if you understood this.\n\n\nA bit more ...\n\nProblem you will face is that in Linux software is not installed into 1 directory with the name of that software as the root directory as in Windows. Software will be in directories bases on functionality. So binaries for admin tasks go to a (/usr)/sbin/. Normal binaries go to (/usr)/bin/. Every file has its location.\nSo if you put directories like ...\n\n\n*\n\n*/etc/\n\n*/var/\n\n*/sbin/\n\n*/usr/\n\n*/run/\n\n\nonto their own partition on the 1Tb disk you will have almost all software on the 1Tb disk. Now it will depend on how you use your system to make this more suited for you. For instance: if you do not use apache and mysql /var/ is not needed. \n\nMind you. I would not bother at all with separating the system besides /home and maybe swap if you are worried about the life span of your SSD. I have a 120 SSD like you and put all but /home/ onto the SSD. Now if you need it for some serious server tasks, ok. You could make life easier backup wise to create different mount points. But the general idea for servers nowadays is also to not do this and just create 1 big partition called /. \n\n\nMy personal setup\n\nThe stuff below this is subjective. We can argue about partition methods for years and years. Here is how I did it: \nMy setup (notebook with 120Gb HDD and 750Gb HDD. I have Ubuntu 14.10, Windows 7 (C: is on the SSD, D: is part of the HDD and Redhat (does not use the ssd) on it. The layout for Ubuntu:\nrinzwind@schijfwereld:/$ df -H\nFilesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on\n/dev/sda5        99G  6,7G   87G   8% /\nnone            4,1k     0  4,1k   0% /sys/fs/cgroup\nudev            2,1G  4,1k  2,1G   1% /dev\ntmpfs           413M  1,1M  412M   1% /run\nnone            5,3M  4,1k  5,3M   1% /run/lock\nnone            2,1G   36M  2,1G   2% /run/shm\nnone            105M   62k  105M   1% /run/user\n/dev/sdb5        25G  2,0G   22G   9% /home\n/dev/sdb6       365G  284G   63G  83% /discworld\n\n/discworld is my 2nd disc. As you can see I have a / that is less than 10% full so the space on my SSD is largely not used and my /home/ is almost empty. And I do not even bother with swap anymore.\nEven with all the software I install I never get over 15Gb before Ubuntu gets a new release. The SSD has been in use for over a year now and it is still healthy. All the scare about it wearing out to me seems ... well ... stupid. Yes it might break someday but that is why all important stuff are on the HDD. But even that disk might day someday. \n", "Q: Which compiler i have to use to understand C behaviour exact behaviour I am confused regarding with the c compilers. as per my knowledge for a programmer the code is not important but the internal behaviour is very important.cause if we know how the compiler behaves for the perticular code then we can write programs easily.\nbut i love linux alot. and my system is linux platform i didn't used windows till now because i hate windows os. i don't know how the behaviour regarding turbo C.\nin my linux system i have gcc version 4.8.2 (Ubuntu 4.8.2-19ubuntu1) \n .but i studied in one Website that we should not use main() directly we should use int main() like that. but my compiler that is compiling below code without error.\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nmain() { /* ... */ }\n\nI am going to attend for the job interviews so which compiler i have to follow suggest me?. i am confused understanding C language.

Maybe your apt_preferences, or something else (Synaptic's Lock Version?) is deciding to not update to 1.10.5? Does Synaptic or apt-cache show workrave show either/both versions (Synaptic package, Properties -> Versions)?

That includes configurations, settings, the theme you chose but also bookmarks and so on. So there are lots of files in there you need not  worry about. \nLeave them as they are. Deleting them will delete your configuration for the program you deleted it for. If you delete the chromuim directory you basically will remove your profile (bookmarks, saved passwords, saved tabs).\nSo I images that since you most times do not need to bother with them and to not clog up the view when looking at your /home/ directory in Nautilus or from command line these have a dot in front of them and kept out of view. If you do need them you probably also know they will be hidden anyways. \nYou can add non-dot files yourself by adding them to a file called \".hidden\".

Or you may need to use sudo with -E\n -E, --preserve-env\n             Indicates to the security policy that the user wishes to pre‐\n             serve their existing environment variables.

The only option for me is to physically press enter key from my workstation. Unfortunately I am not at the place where my workstation is located.\nIs it possible to somehow connect to my workstation at this stage of booting? I assume that no services are running but maybe there is some way that I am not aware of.\n\nA: I don't think you could connect to grub, afaik it doesn't have any networking capability. In the future you might be able to set your computer's BIOS to always boot from another networked computer? Or you could set up grub to have a timeout and a default action if no keys are pressed, might just need to add this to grub.cfg (apparently the top/first entry is 0):\nset timeout=30\nset default=0\n\nBut as for making your computer press enter now, right now, when you're nowhere near it, all I can think of is a telephone to call someone nearby to do that.\n\nA: I'm not sure if it is possible without an additional interface like IPMI or iDRAC installed on a server.\nAnd the connection should be via VNC, or JNLP, or similar, not from ssh.\nAlso, check this thread: https://superuser.com/questions/183401/remote-control-via-ethernet-a-computer-from-boot-for-grub-choices-on-linux\n", "Q: Only half of screen height in VBox seamless mode on secondary screen On my secondary screen my Windows 7 guest in Virtual Box works fine in Fullscreen but not in Seamless Mode.\nIn Seamless Mode the guest only gets half of the actual screen height (2048 x 723 px²)\nSeemless on the first monitor works fine, the resolution is the right one.\nDid anybody encounter the same issue?

Should I set up a password?\nCan someone please explain in very basic terms how to set up my laptop as server and connect to it?\n\nA: The question you ask depends on a number of things including OS, version etc. If this is Ubuntu server, starting instructions are in the server guide, and they work. In essence, by default tcp access to postgres needs to be enabled. PostgreSQL configuration files are at /etc/postgres//main. At this location pg_hba.conf handles the host based access settings where tcp access may be enabled. This and a couple of other files need to be edited as per Ubuntu server guide to get working access to postgres server on localhost.\n", "Q: Why does Ubuntu Download recommend 64-bit install? Why would Ubuntu as a generalized statement recommend its 64 bit “flavour”? \nAs far as I understand a 64-bit OS can only be installed on a 64-bit hardware (CPU), i.e. 32-bit and 64-bit OS can be installed on a 64-bit hardware, but only a 32-bit OS can be installed on a 32-bit hardware (regardless of the amount of RAM available).\nYou can see this on the download site:\n. \nEDIT\nI understand the difference between 32-bit and 64-bit, and I see the pros and cons. For users with a 32-bit hardware this is not a question of choice. Recommending a 64-bit OS without taking into account the hardware is like recommending petrol over diesel and neglecting the engine. The download site does not check for 64 bit processor hardware, and if detected recommend a 64-bit OS, but recommends a 64-bit OS to all users (with more than 2 GB RAM). \nIt has been stated that ”manufacturers don’t really make 32-bit systems any more” (Dalton), and that “almost all chips in recent history are 64 bit” (oldfred). This is true at least for processor families in TOP500 supercomputers. So this recommendation simply reflects a trend in industrial production?\n\nA: Most modern computers come with more than 4GiB of RAM, so you'd need a 64bit OS to use all of this. (Or 32bit with PAE, which is slower) Also, most new machines are using UEFI, and Ubuntu 32bit ISO's aren't UEFI-capable, so here you'd have to go with 64bit\nOn older hardware, which doesn't use UEFI and/or has less then 4GiB of RAM, it doesn't matter, as long as the CPU is 64bit-capable, which most are.\nOther than that, 64bit may be recommended for various reasons:\n\n\n*\n\n*You can run 32bit software on a 64bit CPU (multiarch), but not vice verca. So you may be better off with 64bit when talking about software compatibility.\n\n*If people don't know the difference between 32bit and 64bit, the should choose the one that will run on the most systems with less problems, which probably is 64bit. Although someone might say that people should know the difference when installing an OS by themselves, I've met at least one person who wanted to install Ubuntu and had barely any clue of CPU architecture (\"64bit is better, because it's the greater number\" should indicate his knowledge)\n\n\nThere may be other reasons, but these are the ones I can think of now.\n\nA: It recommends it because 64-bit is faster and today, manufacturers don’t really make 32-bit systems any more. It may also recommend 64-bit because the download site recognized that your pc is 64-bit (the one you are using to download the image). It also says 32-bit is for PC's with less than 2GB of ram because 99.9% of all PC's with less than 2GB of ram are 32-bit. Take it as you will, but 32-bit is being phased out and is mostly on old slow hardware. Ubuntu is not made for outdated hardware, I would use something like xubuntu or lubuntu if you planned on putting on on outdated hardware.\n", "Q: Is there a list of suggested hardware specs for trying Ubuntu Openstack? Build OpenStack with conjure-up | Download | Ubuntu mentions needing 7 computers with two hard disks and at least two with dual nics.  However, it doesn't mention any CPU/storage requirements, nor does it say what these seven will do.\nDoes anyone know what services each of the initial seven required computers runs?  I'm looking at building out a test environment, but want to make sure that I have the correct hardware the first time.\n\nA: CPU and storage requirements are not mentioned because it varies greatly. Generally speaking, your cloud will deploy just fine on server-class hardware that meets the two disks and two NICs requirement.\nThe resources - number of instances you can start, storage space available, etc, will depend on the specs of the hardware you use to build your cloud. You should have hardware appropriate to your intended usage.\n\nA: For the OpenStack Autopilot in LDS 15.01, any 3 servers with IPMI will do, as long as they have 2 disks and at least one of them has 2 NICs (this isn't counting the LDS or MAAS machines).\nIn the most general sense, three servers that are Ubuntu certified will be enough, or if not certified, a BMC supported by MAAS is required (IPMI being the most common choice).\nThat's for building your cloud. As far as to what your cloud can host, the resources - number of instances you can start, storage space available, etc, will depend on the specs of the hardware you use to build your cloud. You should have hardware appropriate to your intended usage.\n\nA: If you just want to get a \"feeling\" for openstack, try devstack on a single machine. I also deployed Openstack on two machines before - one was doing all management, the other one the computing. Their load is quite low (but they are also pretty powerful).\nYou can also try Ubuntu's \"openstack\" package, which can create simpler single node and multi-node configurations which are more realistic than devstack's \"all in one\" approach - which is good to see if your patch compiles, but has little connection with operational reality.\n", "Q: Add a Keyboard Layout in Ubuntu 14.04 I'm trying to set up Mirrorboard on my computer running 14.04 LTS.

I am new to Ubuntu. I want to install the latest Scala version 2.11.4 on my machine but the instructions on their website are cryptic to me. Can any one explain how to install it step by step?\n\nA: Installing scala 2.11.4 or any other version that is not in the Ubuntu repository or a PPA (mind though: scala will require JAVA and I assume you have this installed already. See the ubuntu help if you have not).\n\n\n*\n\n*download the file.\n\n*Extract the contents to somewhere on your system. I would opt for /opt/scala/. Something like:\ntar xvfz ~/Downloads/scala-2.11.4.tgz /opt/\n  mv /opt/scala-2.11.4/ /opt/scala/\n\n*The readme in \"docs\" state you can run scala from the bin directory:\n\nInstallation\nDecompress the archive and run the above commands directly from bin\n  directory. We recommend adding the full path of the bin directory to\n  the PATH environment variable.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*... where you have the following tools:\n- scala       Scala interactive interpreter\n- scalac      Scala compiler\n- fsc         Scala resident compiler\n- scaladoc    Scala API documentation generator\n- scalap      Scala classfile decoder\n\nSo you would do \ncd /opt/scala\nscala\n\nto open the interpreter.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Regarding the PATH mentioned in the read me:\nAdd Scala to your $PATH by adding this line to .profile inside your home directory\nPATH=\"$PATH:/opt/scala/bin\"\n\nMind that the path name needs to be named after what you extracted it too. Adding it would stop the need to do cd /opt/scala/ and you can envoke scala from anywhere on your system.\n\nA: The easiest way to install Scala would be to use the .deb installation file. On the download page you can see the newest stable version. Then go to the All Downloads page and find that version (or Scala 2.11.4). Scroll down to the bottom of that version's page and look for scala-2.11.4.deb (or the appropriate version) and download it.\nIf you're comfortable with the command line, you can install the downloaded Scala deb with:\nsudo dpkg -i scala-2.11.4.deb\n\nOtherwise, you're going to have to install GDebi through either the Ubuntu Software Center, or via a terminal with:\nsudo apt-get install gdebi\n\nOnce GDebi is installed, you can double click scala-2.11.4.deb in your file browser which will open the package installer. Finally, click \"Install Package\", and your new version of Scala will be installed.\n\nA: Just download scala.deb and install it:\nsudo apt-get remove scala-library scala\nwget http://www.scala-lang.org/files/archive/scala-2.11.6.deb\nsudo dpkg -i scala-2.11.6.deb\nsudo apt-get update\n\n\nA: Yes, the installation instructions on scala-lang.org are brief and assume a certain level of proficiency with setting up of environment variables. This assumption is also present in most of the answers here or on stackoverflow. another reson I wanted to add my answer is that there are no more .deb files available for downloading from scala-lang.org. \nRecently I have successfully installed Scala 2.11.7 on my machine following these steps. It was a fresh Scala installation and Java 1.8 was already present.\n\n\n*\n\n*Downloaded scala-2.11.7.tgz from http://www.scala-lang.org/download/ to my Downloads directory.\n\n*Navigate to the downloads directory and unpack the archive:\nsudo tar xvfz scala-2.11.4.tgz\n\n\n*Move the unpacked directory to the directory indicated in the instructions:\nmv scala-2.11.7 /usr/local/share/scala\n\n\n*Set the environment variables permanently. As indicated in the question on Stack Overflow here, and used by other software package installations, (e. g. I found Anaconda Python as the last automatic edit on it), one of reliable ways of doing it is by editing .bashrc file or adding these variables to the PATH directly with these commands:\nexport 'SCALA_HOME=\"/usr/local/share/scala\"' >> ~/.bashrc\n\nexport 'PATH=\"$PATH:$SCALA_HOME/bin\"' >> ~/.bashrc\n\n\n*Reload the shell for the changes to take effect:\nexec $SHELL\n\nNow you can start Scala REPL from the command line by typing:\nscala \n\n", "Q: Issues With UCanAccess driver I've been trying to transfer .accdb and .mdb files onto my computer using the UCanAccess driver and it works but it seems that all of the queries I have are transfer in as tables and many of them are dropped completely.

I have a problem with Autokey: I can't copy-paste through it a special Unicode character. Here is an example:\nI am French, and in French writing, you use a space before a semi-colon. But in formal typography, you don't use a regular space before a semi-colon but a ‘narrow no-break space’ which is the Unicode character U+202F.\nSo when I am writing formal things in French, instead of always wasting time typing CTRL+Shift+U+202F+ENTER+;+space', I would like to use an Autokey new phrase. Using the abbreviation Space+;; (which means, verbally, typing space, then semi-colon twice). Which means when I type (anywhere) space+;;, autokey transforms it into  ; (which is a narrow no-break space followed by a semi-colon).\nBUT the problem here is this: when I create a new phrase in Autokey with  ;, then when I use the abbreviation, Autokey replaces it only with ;, erasing the narrow no-break space. And it appears it does this with any other too-special Unicode character...\nDoes anyone have an idea of how to get round this issue?\nThanks a million!\n\nA: Two options:\n(See my blog for more details and screenshots for option 1)\nFirst option (much simpler)\nUpgrade to the python 3 port of autokey (because python 3 deals with unicode characters better than python 2)\nFor me, the installation worked as follows:\n# Edit (April 2018).

Then, in Autokey's preferences (Script Engine), tell Autokey where this file is. Then the script becomes\nfrom MyCopy import paste_character\npaste_character('γ')\n\nSome applications don't use control+v for paste (eg terminal uses control+shift+v).

Here is my information from Boot-repair: http://paste.ubuntu.com/9319037/\nThe story is I tried to install Ubuntu while I was on Windows 8 and my partitions weren't recognized. I found some commands here (ask ubuntu) that helped me recognize the partitions and installed successfully ubuntu from LiveUSB. \nAfter the first restart there was directly the error from Windows 8 that winload.exe is missing or corrupted. I booted again form the LiveUSB (ubuntu) and run Boot-repair in recommended mode. After the restart I got Ubuntu, but I can't boot into windows. Because I had partition for backup windows (sdb) when i select it it shows me the error with winload.exe. When I select windows (sda1) the screen goes black and nothing happens until I press the turn off button. \nI have full access to the partition of the windows and the windows files and as I was reading I saw some posts that maybe Boot-repair changed the name or something but I couldn't find step by step how to fix that.

I am new to Ubuntu but I am totally in love with Linux and want to keep it as the only OS on my laptop. I want to keep two of my partitions intact and use all the others (Windows boot partition, recovery partition, and system partition). While installing Ubuntu do I need to keep the recovery and system partition? Like what is done with Windows? Sorry for multiple questions in a single post.\n\nA: When you boot Ubuntu (either from an USB stick or DVD), you can select from three installation methods: Erase everything, Split current OS partition, or a custom setup. In your case, you'll have to go the custom setup route (Select the \"Something else...\" option). You should make a backup before doing anything else. Partitioning can result in the corruption of some partitions and you may lose data. Now do your partitioning like this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Find out whether you're using UEFI or not. This is easily found out when the Live System is started. If a GRUB menu shows up, it's UEFI. If a purple screen with keyboard and a man shows up, it's BIOS.\n\n*Delete the Windows partition\n\n*Create a swap partition about the size of your RAM (if you want to, needed for storage of RAM content, e.g. hibernation)\n\n*Fill the remaining space with a new EXT4 partition and set its mount point to /.\n\n*If you're using UEFI: Set the boot partition's mount point to /boot/efi\n\n*In the selection box below, mark the device you're operating on (most likely /dev/sda) as MBR partition (if on a Legacy BIOS system). If you're running an UEFI system, select the boot partition (probably /dev/sda1, the one with the boot mount point)\n\n\nAfter this is done, you can install your system. Afterwards, you could make access to your data partition a lot easier by automounting it. For this you can add an entry into /etc/fstab (open with a text editor using sudo or as root):\nUUID=<enter partition UUID here>    /path/to/mountpoint    partition type    options    0    0\n\nYou commented that you're using FAT and exFAT for your data partition. If you really don't want to change this to some linux-native, like EXT4, as you're booting Linux only, use something like the following line.  You can get the partition UUID with the command sudo blkid:\n#ExFAT\nUUID=xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx    /mnt/exfatfiles    exfat-fuse    defaults,umask=0000    0    0\n#FAT\nUUID=xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx    /mnt/fatfiles    vfat    defaults,umask=0000    0    0\n\nAfter a reboot or sudo mount -a, the partition should be mounted at /mnt/files.\n\nA: You have to use \"Something else\" option when installing and set up partitions for installation yourself.\nI found a good article about installing GNU/Linux, especially there is a good guide on how to keep some of your partitions and doing custom installation.\nDon't get confused with the fact that article is about dual booting Linux and Windows, it contains information you need.\nhttp://www.freeyourselffrommicrosoftandthensa.org/06-dual-boot/6-3-dual-boot-linux-mint-with-windows-xp-or-windows-7\n", "Q: how to control CPU frequency in 14.04? how to control CPU frequency in 14.04? juipiter and cpu-freq cannot be installed due to bugs..

Make sure you have a web server software of some sort (such as Apache2) as well as PHP running before trying to install phpmyadmin. Phpmyadmin is not an independent software but relies on the functions of other software to perform its functionalities. Most importantly, make sure you have MySQL also installed before phpmyadmin.\nSince you are new to web hosting, maybe you should install a package that includes all that stuff. Check out http://vestacp.com for a great package with everything you need. Very easy to install and you can start hosting right away.\n", "Q: Storing a File in the Memory If I have a simply php file that will be accessed a lot, is there a way I can configure the file to be present within the RAM at all times, so rather than reloading the file from the hard drive every time, it's contents can be taken directly from the memory? Of course, writing data to the file would still require writing to the hard drive, but for reading data I want it to be as fast as possible and with less stress on the hard drive. Thanks!\n\nA: Files read from disk are stored in the disk cache of Linux (RAM). You do not need to configure anything, this works out-of-the-box.\nIf you would like have a filesystem backed by RAM rather than a disk, then you are looking for a \"RAM disk\" (not to be confused with the Linux ramdisk filesystem). The tmpfs filesystem stores all its contents in RAM (which could be swapped though).\nThe above is unlikely going to improve your PHP application performance. Depending on your application, you are better off with caching the PHP response in the webserver (or just use static HTML/JS/whatever files to avoid PHP completely).\n", "Q: Instructions Installing Juno Pulse I need to install Juno Pulse - how can I do this?\n\nA: Full Explination how to Install Juno Pulse and connect to remote access:\nhttp://computing.vt.edu/kb/entry/3987\nHope this helps!\n", "Q: Fail to start openvpn server I'm trying to setup an openvpn server by following this tutorial.\nThe relevant parts of my server.conf is as below.\nroot@something:/etc/openvpn/easy-rsa# cat /etc/openvpn/server.conf | grep \"^[^#;]\" \nport 1194\nproto udp\ndev tun\nca ca.crt\ncert something.crt\nkey something.key  # This file should be kept secret\ndh dh2048.pem\nserver 10.8.0.0 255.255.255.0\nifconfig-pool-persist ipp.txt\nkeepalive 10 120\ncomp-lzo\npersist-key\npersist-tun\nstatus openvpn-status.log\nverb 3\n\nThe server fails to start and error messages below are posted in my syslog.\nNov 30 21:45:46 mini ovpn-server[8696]: 192.168.0.1:40880 TLS Error: TLS key negotiation failed to occur within 60 seconds (check your network connectivity)\nNov 30 21:45:46 mini ovpn-server[8696]: 192.168.0.1:40880 TLS Error: TLS handshake failed\nNov 30 21:45:46 mini ovpn-server[8696]: 192.168.0.1:40880 SIGUSR1[soft,tls-error] received, client-instance restarting\nNov 30 21:45:48 mini ovpn-server[8696]: 192.168.0.1:56890 TLS: Initial packet from [AF_INET]192.168.0.1:56890, sid=376b5dcc ec4c9266\n\nAnyone got a clue about what I'm doing wrong?

I think I had managed to fix it last time, but I am not sure how.\nMy issue is to be able to use an external bluetooth speaker with MPD. Even better, I would like to be able to use both the plugged and the bluetooth speaker at the same time.\nUnfortunately, MPD does not show under the applications that are producing audio under Gnome audio settings, and hence it ignores my directive to use the bluetooth speaker. I think this is because MPD is using Alsa instead of Pulseaudio.\nNow, in my mpd.conf I have the lines\naudio_output {\n    type        \"pulse\"\n    name        \"MPD\"\n#   server      \"localhost\"\n}\n\nI have also tried to decomment the server line, but in this case, MPD does not even start.\nTo clarify, MPD is running under the user mpd, which is under the groups pulse and pulse-access, but this does not seem to be enough.\nNow, I believe I can run MPD under my own user, and this could fix some of the issues, but I'd rather not, as other users of this PC may want to listen to music as well.\nWhat is the right way to make MPD use Pulseaudio (or do whatever is necessary to connect it to other speakers than the default?)\n\nA: The solution proposed by @Takkat also worked for me with a little modification:\nOn Debian Buster, I just had to replace localhost with 127.0.0.1 in mpd.conf server option, overwise mpd tried to connect with the IPv6 address ::1 and failed with:\nERROR: Failed to open \"My PULSE Device\" [pulse]; failed to connect: Access denied\n\n(Sorry for the answer instead of comment, I'm new here and doesn't have enough points yet to comment. No problem for me if someone moves or remove this message).\n\nA: Unlike MPD in system wide mode PulseAudio is running in userspace. This means, all pulseaudio settings including Bluetooth discovery and providing a Bluetooth audio sink is done from a user session.\nThe MPD daemon, when running system wide, is unable to access Pulse Audio devices  running in a user session. As it is in theory possible to run Pulse Audio in system wide mode, this is not recommended, at least we should not do so in a desktop setup. It would then be a much better option to run MPD from userspace.\nTo still be able to make use of devices a running PulseAudio server provides we use of TCP streaming capabilites of both, PulseAudio and MPD.\nThis requires the following in /etc/mpd.conf:\naudio_output {\n       type     \"pulse\"\n       name     \"My PULSE Device\"\n       server   \"localhost\"\n}\n\nThen we also need to load the TCP protocol to stream to a running PulseAudio server. This can be added to the /etc/pulse/default.pa to be loaded every time a user logs in (or started from CLI for testing with pacmd load-module).\nload-module module-native-protocol-tcp auth-ip-acl=127.0.0.1 # IP of localhost\n\nDisclaimer: This should work for switching to a Bluetooth audio device but I could not test this because my Bluetooth dongle has issues on my 14.10 test system.\n", "Q: Can't boot into virtual machie Fist timer to unix/ linux operating systems.

If you wish to create 64 bit guests then we recommend that you upgrade to the latest version. Note that VirtualBox also supports 64-bit guest operating systems, under the following conditions:\n    You need a 64-bit processor with hardware virtualization support (see User Manual chapter 1.2, Software vs. hardware virtualization (VT-x and AMD-V), page 10) and a 64-bit host operating system.\n    NOTE: Since version 2.1.0, you can run 64 bit Guests while running a 32 bit Host. The prior requirement for Operating System is only for version 2.0.x. You still need the proper hardware.\n    You must enable hardware virtualization through your BIOS; software virtualization is not supported for 64-bit VMs.\n    Note: some HP BIOSES have a glitch, When You ENABLE VT-X/AMD-V, You DISABLE it, so do try both ways.\n\n\nSo I would try downloading 32bit ubuntu here - http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop.\n\nA: \ni686 code is intended to be executed on processors which are compatible\nwith the 32 bit Intel x86 platform, which includes all Intel 32bit x86\nprocessors up to and including the Pentium 4, etc. as well as processors\nfrom AMD and other vendors which make compatible 32bit chips. \nx86_64 code is intended to be executed on processors which are\ncompatible with the AMD64 64bit platform, including the AMD Athlon 64,\nAMD Opteron and related AMD chip families, and the Intel EM64T based\nprocessors. \nThese 64bit processors are fully backward compatible with their 32bit\npredecessors.

I am also suspecting some corrupted files that remained from an unfinished try of windows of ubuntu installation can cause the same problem.\nSo, my question is how can I get my HDD back, even if it needed to be completely formatted and data will be lost(Of course, it would be my last option).\nThank you for reading and helping.\n\nA: Yeah, I used to do this such of mess moving partitions too.\nforget the grub rescue, download the grub rescue cd:\nhttp://sourceforge.net/projects/boot-repair-cd/\nrun it in a USB stick or a cd and it will restore the boot to ubuntu automatically.\nor you can use any debian-based live cd and follow these steps:\nboot the live cd, chose try ubuntu/debian/etc., open a terminal and then run these commands:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair && sudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install -y boot-repair && (boot-repair &)\n\nA: I have solve the issue last night.\nWhat I have done was to use the following commands first to get grub menu back from grub rescue:\ngrub rescue> set boot=(hd0,msdos6)\n grub rescue> set prefix=(hd0,msdos6)/boot/grub\n grub rescue> insmod normal\n grub rescue> normal\n\nAfter this I got to grub usual boot selection menu.\nThen instead of booting to windows or ubuntu I just selected c to enter the grub command line and then I have used the following instructions on grub command line to (I think) repair the grub:  \ngrub> set root=(hd0,6)\ngrub> linux /boot/vmlinuz-3.13.0-29-generic root=/dev/sda6\ngrub> initrd /boot/initrd.img-3.13.0-29-generic\ngrub> boot\nI have replaced the name vmlinuz-3.13.0... with my own version which was vmlinuz-3.8.0... and also the same in line with initrd.img-3.13.0... which I typed initrd.img-3.8.0....\nThe important thing was to determine the linux installation drive, then find out the correct version of above mentioned files.\nI have used the latter instructions from following link and modified the file-names with my own version numbers:\nhttp://www.linux.com/learn/tutorials/776643-how-to-rescue-a-non-booting-grub-2-on-linux/\n", "Q: Weird bug in qml and oxyde I have made an app with this source code:\nhttp://pastebin.com/zMwtusZJ\nHowever when I try to run the app the webview instead becomes black and does not load the web page.\nHere is the crash output:\nhttp://pastebin.com/AjDjadEP\nWhen I define a width for the webview element with something like->width:units.gu(160)\nThen it works just fine.However if possible I would prefer it to use the full height of the parent.\nHere is the fixed and improved source: http://pastebin.com/6UyMF9Tb\n\nA: I was unable to reproduce your problem, but when I ran your sample, I didn't see the webview at all.  It looks to me that your positioning is very confused.  You have a Column containing a single Row, which contains another Column.  This doesn't really make sense.  It's obscured by incorrect indentation, so the first take-away is, clean up your code before you post it.  Not only will it help those trying to help you, you may discover the problem in the process.\nYou are mixing positioning by explicit sizing and anchoring.  For example, your outer column has both the width set explicitly and implicitly, through the anchor.fill attribute.  Do you know which one will win if they disagree?  I sure don't.\nAlong a similar line, you set the width of the WebView to be the width of its parent, the Row.  But the Row has to be wide enough to hold all of its children, so it must be wider than the WebView.  How does QML resolve this?  I don't know.  I find Row and Column good for arranging a number of Elements of known size, but not for holding elements that should take up the remaining space.  If that's what you want, do it explicitly or through anchors.\nBelow, I've rewritten your example code into a form that works for me.  I don't know that this was the layout you were trying for, but hopefully it's clear enough for you to rearrange it as you see fit.\nI chose to put the URL entry and the buttons in a Row, since all of them are of a fixed size.  The WebView should take up the rest of the space, so I anchor its top to the bottom of the Row (with a 1 gu margin) and its bottom to the bottom of the Page.  Setting its width to the Page width ensures that it reaches all the way across, although that could also have been accomplished with anchors.\nimport QtQuick 2.0\nimport Ubuntu.Components 1.1\nimport com.canonical.Oxide 1.0\nimport QtQuick.Window 2.0\n\nMainView {\n    applicationName: \"com.ubuntu.developer.mkamenjak77.bugapp\"\n    useDeprecatedToolbar: false\n    width: Screen.width/2\n    height: Screen.height/2\n\n    Page {\n        Row{\n            id: controlRow\n\n            TextField {\n                id: textfield\n                text: \"http://google.com\"\n                width: units.gu(40)\n\n                Keys.onReturnPressed: {\n                    if (textfield.text.substring(0, 7) != \"http://\")\n                        textfield.text = \"http://\" + textfield.text;\n                    webview.url = textfield.text\n                }\n            }\n\n            Button {\n                width: units.gu(10)\n                text: i18n.tr(\"Osvježi\")\n                onClicked: webview.reload()\n            }\n\n            Button {\n                width: units.gu(10)\n                text: i18n.tr(\"Naprijed\")\n                onClicked: webview.goForward()\n            }\n\n            Button {\n                width: units.gu(10)\n                text: i18n.tr(\"Natrag\")\n                onClicked: webview.goBack()\n            }\n        }\n\n        WebView {\n            id: webview\n            width: parent.width\n            anchors.top: controlRow.bottom\n            anchors.topMargin: units.gu(1)\n            anchors.bottom: parent.bottom\n\n            Component.onCompleted: {\n                url = textfield.text\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n", "Q: When can I buy an Ubuntu tablet?

I try to ensure my question is specific and follows your guidelines. I apologize in advance if it does not. \n\nA: I would advise you not to use EasyBCD but to go with GRUB2.\nGRUB2 will detect both Ubuntu and Windows 7 and will give you the option at boot time to select which operating system you want to start.\nDo not mess with the Ubuntu partition from within Windows.\nWindows is very intolerant with respect to other operating systems.\nFurthermore if your Ubuntu partition contains an filesystem which is NOT FAT32 or NTFS (and this is most likely the case) then Windows will not recognize it anyway because Windows can't read the Linux type filesystems.\nLinux can read FAT32 and NTFS (and ofcourse the typical Linux file systems) so always perform file system operations from within Linux.\n\nA: You can edit the /boot/grub.cfg to timeout=0 it will make the grub page disappear faster.\nI prefer to disable windows 7 updates they are too annoying.\nthe partition should appear as unknown partition on disk manager.

Yesterday, I wanted to try Arch Linux, so I installed it in a new partition and in the process I was told, since my system is UEFI, I had to create a new partition to put the boot files there. So, I created a partition of 512 MB and put it there.\nHowever, grub couldn't start and nothing worked. I suspect that the problem was that the partition scheme in my system is MBR and not GPT, since I used to have a partition with Windows.\nI deleted everything and installed Ubuntu 14.04 LTS again and now the system works. However, in my BIOS I can still see the boot partition I created and select to start from it, even though I deleted it. How can I solve this ?

I think the \"low space\" warning only comes up for / and/or your home?\n\nA: I think you're low enough on disk space that linux is using special reserved space.

As in, to write this as an install image so it would configure it automatically on install\n\nA: I'm reading \"from a configuration\" as in \"from a configuration right after installing\" so this sounds pretty close:\nI use a bash script to set up some general items after installing (I usually run a live usb so every boot is like a fresh install), the script copies config files to $HOME & /etc & other places (software repos, etc), installs a few programs (pre-downloaded .deb's or could apt-get update && apt-get install ...) and log out & log in (easiest way to \"reset\" desktop settings).\nYou can do that by adding the script & files to another drive, another partition, even online somewhere, or if you've got a live .iso extracted in a writable filesystem (some liveusb creators do that) copy them to a new dir.

Or you mean you want to free space on your hard drive to install windows there?\nFor clearing HD space, assuming you have enough free space, I'd run gparted (maybe from a live iso/cd/dvd) and shrink partitions until there's enough free space to create a new partition of the desired size, then tell the windows installer to use the new/empty partition.\nFor clearing a USB drive, it's pretty much the same thing only it should work without needing to run a live usb/cd/iso.\n", "Q: Unreliable Wireless Ubuntu 14.04 I've been using Ubuntu for a while, but a recurring problem I've experienced is that connections to wireless networks, particularly eduroam, are very unstable. As soon as I connect myself to the network, it's only a matter of time, 10 minutes at most, before I immediately disconnect and am prompted for the network's password.\nMy laptop is an ASUS N56JR with an Intel Dual Band Wireless-N 7260 network adapter. I apologize if this is a duplicate, but I assure you I've tried many of the other question's suggestions, to no avail.\nI should also add that I dualboot Ubuntu (14.04) with Windows 8.1, and I have none of the issues I've described here on Windows, which leads me to believe this is has to do with my drivers on Ubuntu.\n\nA: A guess...but this may be due to varying signal strength of your connection.\nI use the network connections program, which is by default on the xfce panel.  Edit the connection you are trying to use, and enter the MAC address of the hotspot you are connecting to (not your MAC) into the BSSID field. then save.  This causes the software to weld itself to that connection, even though surrounding signals may be stronger. You may need something like WiFi Radar to find out what the MAC address is.\nI'm running xfce, so this may vary depending on your gui, and how network connections are handled on your system.

I am installing openstack by a guide.

And I want to know the meaning of management, instance tunnels, external, and how can I config for those network interfaces.\n\nA: The documentation is a bit poor and assumes a bit of knowledge.\nAnyway, it all depends on the setup.  Typically there are a number of logical networks.\nAre you installing using the manual steps or are you using an installer such as RDO, as you may find the networking models slightly different ?\nA typical setup would have something like this.\nManagement / API - this gives you ssh access onto the box, and exposes the service APIs so that clients can remotely interface with the cloud.\nInternal - communication between services in a multi node setup.  On test setups this is often collapsed into management.\nPrivate / instance - in Openstack your tenants can create virtual networks.  There are a number of ways to do this but GRE it VXLAN is fairly popular.  This acts as an encapsulation layer running over the top of your l2 network.  \nExternal then is usually a routable ip, and is either a network that gives direct access to your VMs, or is a range that is used for your floating IPs.\n\nA: tunnel network is for communication which is not important for controller or other nodes.\nFor ex. if you have two compute node. both have VM with 10.10.10.5/16 and 10.10.1.27/16. if both want to communication, then router or switch for both is hosted on network node. so VM hosted under openstack cloud, they don't need to communicate with controller, so this data travels through tunnel network between compute node and network node. \n", "Q: Get Window Title or Application Name with Python I'm working with multitouch and I try to do different stuff on different applications with the same gestures.\nI have a python script, basic works.\nBot how can I decide between the applications?

If I enter another symbol the procedure repeats. If I press Ctrl-D (EOF) instead of entering another symbol, the program terminates. The first question is why when I run this code and after entering a symbol ('i') and I don't press Enter but I press Ctrl-D, it prints entered symbol and prints it in that way:\nii // the first symbol is entered, the second is printed after Ctrl-D\nSo to terminate the program I need to press Ctrl-D again.\n\n\n*Why in the code above I can enter a word and it prints a word and in code below it prints only one symbol even if I entered a word? The code:\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main(void) {\n    int c;\n\n    printf(\"Enter a character:\\n\");\n    c = getchar();\n    printf(\"Entered character is:\\n\");\n    putchar(c);\n    printf(\"\\n\");\n\n    return 0;\n}\n\nWill be grateful for any help.\n\nA: As a general rule for input in C, it usually works in lines -- that is, it is buffered. That means that anything you type is not actually sent to the program until Enter is pressed. So, for the first program, it is simply waiting (also called \"blocking\") at the getchar() request until a line of data comes in. Therefore, it doesn't actually see anything that's typed until the whole line is sent.\nThe line is sent in the form of \"This is a line[EOF]\" (where [EOF] is a literal EOF character as defined by the C runtime). The loop in the first program works somewhat like a do/while construct by simply grabbing characters one at a time from the buffer and printing them until the end. As you know, Ctrl+D is a shell synonym for EOF. In the first program, when you press Enter it causes the cursor to move to the beginning of the next line (notice how there is no \"\\n\" in that program, the \"\\n\" is done by the user pressing Enter after the input line). This is why when you use Ctrl+D that a line break does not occur since it is not the program itself producing the line break but the user pressing the Enter key that produces this line break.\nThe second program is much the same, however there is no loop for the getchar() call. This means that getchar() is called only once. This fetches the first character from the input buffer, prints that character followed by a new line and then exits. Since there is no loop to tell it to do getchar() more than once, this is why you're only seeing a single character and not the entire line.\nFor clarity, remember that input is buffered. So, in the second program you grab a single character from the beginning of the input buffer. However, the rest of those characters will remain there until use use another call to retrieve them. A common mistake when beginning C/C++ programming is forgetting to empty the buffer when you're done with it. Otherwise, that data will remain there.\nI remember when I first started programming C++ (my first language) I was confounded that I would use code somewhat like the following:\n#include <iostream>\n\nint main()\n{\n  std::cout << \"Enter a sentence: \";\n  std::string the_sentence;\n  std::cin >> the_sentence;\n  std::cout << \"\\nYou entered: \" << the_sentence << std::endl;\n  std::cout << \"Enter another sentence: \";\n  std::cin >> the_sentence;\n  std::cout << \"\\nYou entered: \" << the_sentence << std::endl;\n  return 0;\n}\n\nAnd I would get an example program run somewhat like:\nEnter a sentence: Hi my name is Bob!\nYou entered: Hi\nEnter a sentence: (the program would seemingly skip this input block)\nYou entered: my\n\nThis is because the std::cin call would only read up until the first space, leaving the rest of the input on the buffer. Come the next std::cin call, it pulled the first thing that was left in the buffer causing it to completely skip the actual input phase as it already had stuff to read still in the buffer.\nIn order to flush the buffer in C, you could use something like\nwhile((c = getchar()) != '\\n' && c != EOF);\n\nwhich is simply a one-liner while loop that essentially does the same thing as the loop from the first program, but it simply discards the input\nIf I answered your question adequately, be sure to select my answer as the best answer.

It loads the partition empty. In the Plex forum answered me to change the mounting point to /media/Radi and it will load the files, so how to do?\n\nA: Firstly get to know the partition reference. Run sudo blkid and note the UUID of the partition.\nNext you need to modify your /etc/fstab file to point to the desired mount point. Run sudo xdg-open /etc/fstab and add a line or modify the line referencing the partition.\nAn example line:\nUUID=\"xxxx-xxxx\"    /media/Radi ext4    defaults,user,auto  0   1\n\nThen reboot your computer or run sudo mount -a\n\nA: Copy all the files and folders from \"/media/radibg2/Radi/\" to \"/media/Radi\". \nThen unmount your partition \nExample:\numount [EXT] /media/radibg2/Radi/\n\nEdit your fstab file:\nsudo vi /etc/fstab\n\nChange the mount point to \"/media/Radi\" from \"/media/radibg2/Radi/\" in fstab file and save the file\nNow remount your partition with the mount point \"/media/Radi\"\nExample:\nmount -t xfs /dev/sdb1 /media/Radi\n\nHope this helps!\n\nA: Are you able to see & read/view the media files at all?

But running your web browser with sudo shouldn't affect the results.\nAfter browsing https://forums.plex.tv/index.php/topic/26727-how-to-plex-media-server-on-ubuntu/ it appears that Plex runs as it's own user, so maybe the plex user doesn't have read permission on the media files... \nIf you want to quickly and temporarily add a second mount point (to test if plex will see the media files mounted somewhere else) you can bind mount it to another directory with mount --bind olddir newdir (kind of like \"linking\" the two directories)\nThen to change the mount point permanently just edit it's line in /etc/fstab changing the old /media/radibg2/Radi/ into /media/Radi (FYI lsblk will tell you what partition is currently mounted where).\n", "Q: Ubuntu MAAS Juju bootstrap stuck on fetching tools I need help with juju bootstrap in maas environment.

On how to build from sources, here's a link to start with: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CompilingEasyHowTo\n", "Q: Can anybody read my password protected hard drive files using my hard drive as secondary hard drive? So i have a laptop with ubuntu as OS. now can anyone having physical access to my hardrive ,see my data just by simply using it as secondary hard drive in another laptop or machine?\n\nA: Yes, they would be able to access the data. If you want to avoid that, you have to encrypt the data. Here is some information how to use the encrypted \"Private\" folder or to encrypt your home folder: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EncryptedHome\nHere you can find how to encrypt any folder or partition: https://help.ubuntu.com/12.04/serverguide/ecryptfs.html\n\nA: Yes, you will need encryption if you want to stop the average user.\nThe past has proven encryption can also be bypassed through backdoors. There was a newsitem back in 2013 that the NSA paid for a backdoor in the RSA encryption. But it is unlikely that the NSA or someone who knew how this backdoor works is the person mounting your disk. \nYou will not have a 100% guarantee in any case.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.10 server startup I install just the OpenSSH server on hardware that was running 14.04 Server.

After doing the following I no longer get the error message and my server seems to be behaving normally.

I was then upgrade to version 15.\n", "Q: How to upgrade Xampp to the newest version This might seem like a silly question but by golly I've tried and tried for a whole week and no results.\nI don't know if it's something wrong with my queries, or too much \"Install Xampp\" clutter in my search results (and not Upgrade Xampp) - But I just can't find a solution that works on my server.\nI've got Ubuntu Server 12.04 (Terminal only), and on it phpstatus = 5.4.7 (i.e. Xampp version is 5.4.7).\nI want to upgrade said Xampp (Lampp...) to the latest, which according to the file downloaded from apachefriends com - is 5.6.3\nI've tried the following two sets of instructions (which strangely enough are the ONLY ones I managed to find online) to no avail. After using either apt-get or the bitnami GUI (via SSH with PuTTy + Xming) - the command phpstatus still outputs 5.4.7\nI've even tried both methods under the actual root user on the device. No success there either.\nAfter reading the apachefriends FAQ I thought that in order to upgrade, all I need to do is install Xampp in it's newest version right over the old Xampp installation. But maybe it's not the case?\nPlease - I need some help here. How do I upgrade my Xampp and why isn't it working with the methods I've tried?\nHere are the two methods I've tried. Copied directly as I found them online:\n\nEnsure the XAAMP repository is added:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:upubuntu-com/xampp\n\nThen update with:\nsudo apt-get update\n\n\nThat was one method, here's the other:\n\nHow do I install XAMPP?\nChoose your flavor for your linux OS, the 32-bit or 64-bit version.\nChange the permissions to the installer\nchmod 755 xampp-linux-*-installer.run\n\nRun the installer\nsudo ./xampp-linux-*-installer.run\n\nThat's all. XAMPP is now installed below the /opt/lampp directory.\n\nWhat could I be missing?\n\nA: Uninstall lampp with the following command: \nsudo /opt/lampp/uninstall\n\nThis will keep untouched three folders in your installation directory (htdocs, temp and var). Htdocs is the folder which contains the files and var is the folder which contains the databases of all your projects.\nAfterwards, change the permissions of the installer you downloaded \nchmod 755 xampp-linux-*-installer.run\n\nand run the installer\nsudo ./xampp-linux-*-installer.run\n\nAll done. XAMPP is now installed under /opt/lampp directory.\n\nA: Regarding the PPA. If you look at their launchpad page you will see that it is 110 weeks old. By the way: their PPA states it is version 1.8.1. That seems WAY off from your version. Looking at the XAMPP download page that seems to be explained by a skip in version numbering. So do not bother with the PPA; it seems dead. \nLooks like their numbering got changed to the PHP version related to the XAMPP version. So you will also want to update PHP to 5.6.3. This might become problematic and you might need to switch to Ubuntu 14.04\nRegarding installation from the run file. The \"*\" in that denotes the version so if you downloaded. 1 thing you need to consider: the version you type is the 32-bit version. If you need the 64-bit version you need xampp-linux-x64-5.6.3-0-installer.run.\nYou will also need to do the post install alterations. Change your PATH variable to the new download and execute the daemon. Like you did the 1st time.\n\nA: if you are using xampp older version and need to upgrade it to newer one you donot need to worry in ubuntu \njust download the newer version and run the commad:\n    ./xampp.run\nit will automatically upgrade the last installed xampp in location\n    /opt/lampp\n", "Q: Can I mount two USB3 'flash' thumb-drives in a RAID configuration? I am asking before I buy... I am getting a new Chromebook to run Ubuntu on. For storage I would like to use the two USB ports with a thumb-drive in each (I don't plan on using any other USB doodads).\nCan I use two identical USB3 thumb-drives and mount them in a RAID configuration, thereby doubling the speed?\n\nA: Yes, that is possible, but it is not going to be a good solution. You can add pretty much every block device to a software RAID. But the limitations of that device will limit the whole array. In case of USB the limiting factors are speed (yes, even with USB 3.0) and reliability. Also the devices will have to be plugged in all the time. If one is not accessible even for a short time, the RAID will be degraded and has to be rebuilt. This might take hours. So, there is no hot-plugging.\nOverall what you are trying to do can work, but it is no recommended and your goal of getting more speed will not be reached.\nIt you need extra USB RAID storage for your computer: there are dual hard drive enclosures on the market that can combine the drive to a RAID and have USB 3.0 connectors. Unluckily they will need external power.\n", "Q: Ethernet (intermittent) +wifi (not working) in 14.04 on HP Elitebook 725 I have purchased an HP Elitebook 725 and installed Ubuntu to dual boot with Windows.

How do I do this from the terminal? There are no subdirectories so no need for any recursion.\n\nA: cd <the directory you want>\nfind . -type f ! -iname \"*.pdf\" -delete\n\n\n*\n\n*The first command will take you to the directory in which you want to delete your files\n\n*The second command will delete all files except with those ending with .pdf in filename\n\n\nFor example, if there is a directory called temp in your home folder:\ncd ~/temp\n\nthen delete files:\nfind . -type f ! -iname \"*.pdf\" -delete\n\nThis will delete all files except xyz.pdf.\nYou can combine these two commands to:\nfind ~/temp -type f ! -iname \"*.pdf\" -delete\n\n\n. is the current directory. ! means to take all files except the ones with .pdf at the end. -type f selects only files, not directories. -delete means to delete it.\nNOTE: this command will delete all files (except pdf files but including hidden files) in current directory as well as in all sub-directories. ! must come before -name. simply -name will include only .pdf, while -iname will include both .pdf and .PDF\nTo delete only in current directory and not in sub-directories add -maxdepth 1:\nfind . -maxdepth 1 -type f ! -iname \"*.pdf\" -delete\n\n\nA: With bash's extended shell globbing, you could remove any files with extensions other than .pdf using\nrm -- *.!(pdf)\n\nAs noted by @pts, the -- characters indicate the end of any command options, make the command safe in the rare case of files whose names start with a - character.\nIf you want to delete files without any extension as well as those with extensions other than .pdf, then as pointed out by @DennisWilliamson you could use\nrm -- !(*.pdf)\n\nExtended globbing should be enabled by default, but if not you can do so using\nshopt -s extglob\n\n\nEspecially if you intend to use this inside a script, it's important to note that if the expression doesn't match anything (i.e. if there are no non-pdf files in the directory), then by default the glob will be passed unexpanded to the rm command, resulting in an error like \nrm: cannot remove `*.!(pdf)': No such file or directory\n\nYou can modify this default behaviour using the nullglob shell option, however that has its own issue.

For example:\n\n\n*\n\n*ls shows me everything\n\n*ls | grep pdf shows me the files I want to keep. Hmm.\n\n*ls | grep -v pdf shows the opposite: all except what I want to keep. In other words, it shows the list of things I want to delete. I can confirm this before doing anything dangerous.\n\n*ls | grep -v pdf | xargs rm sends exactly that list to rm for deletion\n\n\nAs I said, I mainly like this for the safety it provides: no accidental rm * for me. Two other advantages:\n\n\n*\n\n*It's composable; you can use ls or find to get the initial list, as you prefer. You can use anything else you like in the process of narrowing that list - another grep, some awk, or whatever. If you needed to delete only files whose names contain a color, you could build it up this same way.\n\n*You can use each tool for its main purpose. I prefer to use find for finding and rm for removal, as opposed to having to remember that find accepts a -delete flag. And if you do this, again, you can compose alternate solutions; maybe instead of rm, you could create a trash command that moves the file to the trash (allowing \"undeletion\") and pipe to that instead of rm. You don't need to have find support that option, you just pipe to it.\n\n\nUpdate\nSee comments by @pabouk for how modify this to handle some edge cases, such as line breaks in file names, filenames like my_pdfs.zip, etc.\n\nA: I usually solve such problems from the interactive Python interpreter:\nmic@mic ~ $ python\n>>> import os\n>>> for f in os.listdir('.'):\n...   if not f.endswith('.pdf'):\n...     os.remove(f)\n\nIt might be longer than a one-liner with find or xargs, but it's extremely resilient, and I know exactly what it does, without having to research it first.\n\nA: Better answer (compared to my previous answer) to this question would be by using the powerful file command.\n$ file -i abc.pdf\nabc: application/pdf; charset=binary\n\nnow your problem:\ncd <the directory you want to search in>\nfor var in ./*\ndo\n  if file -i \"$var\" | grep -q 'application/pdf\\;'\n    then\n    echo \"$var\"\n  fi\ndone\n\nThe job of for command is give the files in current directory in the form of variable $var. if-then command outputs the names of pdf files by taking the exit status of 0 from file -i \"$var\" | grep -q 'application/pdf\\;' command, it will give exit status of 0 only if it finds pdf files.\n\nA: Delete to trash:\n$ cd <the directory you want>\n$ gvfs-trash !(*.pdf)\n\nOr via mv command (but in this way you cannot restore it from Trash since it doesn't record .trashinfo information, so this means you moved your files to a destination where it is as following).\nmv !(*.pdf) ~/.local/share/Trash/files\n\n\nA: The easiest approach:  Create another directory somewhere (if you're only deleting in one directory, not recursively, it can even be a subdirectory); move all the .pdf's there; delete everything else; move the pdf's back; delete the intermediate directory.\nQuick, easy, you can see exactly what you're doing.  Just make sure the intermediate directory is on the same device as the directory you're cleaning up so that moves are renames, not copies!\n\nA: rm $(ls -lo|grep -v [Pp][Dd][Ff]$|awk '{print $7}')\n\nWarning! Better try first\nls -l $(ls -lo|grep -v [Pp][Dd][Ff]$|awk '{print $7}')\n\n\nA: rm -i -- !(*@(a|x).pdf)\n\nRead as, remove all files that are not a.pdf or x.pdf.\nThis works by making use of 2 extended globs, the outer !() to negate the contained glob which itself requires that the glob must match one or more of a or x patterns before the .pdf suffix. See glob#extglob.\n$ ls -a\n.dotfile1 .dotfile2 a.pdf x.pdf y.zip z.mp3\n\n$ echo -- !(a.pdf)\n-- x.pdf y.zip z.mp3\n\n$ echo -- !(x.pdf)\n-- a.pdf y.zip z.mp3\n\n$ echo -- !(a.pdf|x.pdf)\n-- y.zip z.mp3\n\n$ echo -- !(@(a|x).pdf)   # NOTE.that this matches the .dotfiles* as well\n-- . .. .dotfile1 .dotfile2 y.zip z.mp3\n\n$ echo -- !(*@(a|x).pdf)  # but this doesn't\n-- y.zip z.mp3\n\n$ echo rm -i -- !(*@(a|x).pdf)\nrm -i -- y.zip z.mp3\n\n\nA: portable shell way\n$ ksh -c 'for i in ./*; do case $i in *.pdf)continue;; *)rm \"$i\";; esac;done'\n\nPretty much POSIX and compatible with any Bourne-style shell ( ksh, bash, dash ). Well suited for portable scripts and when you can't use bash's extended shell globbing. \nperl:\n$ perl -le 'opendir(my $d,\".\"); foreach my $f (grep(-f && !/.pdf/ , readdir($d))){unlink $f};closedir $d'                                                             \n\nOr slightly cleaner:\n$ perl -le 'opendir(my $d,\".\"); map{ unlink $_ } grep(-f \"./$_\" && !/.pdf/ , readdir($d));closedir $d'\n\nalternative python\npython -c 'import os;map(lambda x: os.remove(x), filter(lambda x: not x.endswith(\".pdf\"),os.listdir(\".\")))'\n\n\nA: Be Careful of what you're deleting!\nA safe way to test it before trying to delete is to test first with ls, as some uncaught behaviors could delete unwanted files. And you can do it directly outside of the directory. ls is similar to rm, so :\nls sub/path/to/files/!(*.pdf)\n\nThis will list\ny.zip\nz.mp3\n\nAnd now you can see what you're deleting and can safely delete them :\nrm sub/path/to/files/!(*.pdf)\n\nAnd that's it.

I created .tgz archive via Total Commander on Windows, can I later open it on Ubuntu? And is it the same as .tar.gz? Thanks\n\nA: Yes you can.\n.tgz is the same as .tar.gz, just like .jpg and .jpeg represent the same file extension.\n\nA: Actually, a file extension has no meaning in Ubuntu. Ubuntu determines (at least should) a file's content by its MIME type, not by its extension. But .tgz and .tar.gz are used for the same purpose: To describe a gzip-compressed TAR archive.\nAs TAR is an open archive format, it can be read without problems on any system that supports it. Ubuntu does so - every .deb package is compressed as a gzipped TAR.\nSo unless you didn't apply any encryption etc., you shouldn't have any problems. If you're still not sure, boot Ubuntu into a live environment and find out.\n\nExample: I copied a driver packed into a file ending in .tar.gz into two other ones ending in .tgz and .foo:\n$ file DPO_RT3290_LinuxSTA_V2600_20120508.tar.gz\nDPO_RT3290_LinuxSTA_V2600_20120508.tar.gz: gzip compressed data, from Unix, last modified: Sat Oct 12 00:22:20 2013\n$ cp DPO_RT3290_LinuxSTA_V2600_20120508.tar.gz DPO_RT3290_LinuxSTA_V2600_20120508.tgz && file DPO*tgz\nDPO_RT3290_LinuxSTA_V2600_20120508.tgz: gzip compressed data, from Unix, last modified: Sat Oct 12 00:22:20 2013\n$ cp DPO_RT3290_LinuxSTA_V2600_20120508.tar.gz DPO_RT3290_LinuxSTA_V2600_20120508.foo && file DPO*foo\nDPO_RT3290_LinuxSTA_V2600_20120508.foo: gzip compressed data, from Unix, last modified: Sat Oct 12 00:22:20 2013\n\nSo as Shakespeare already wrote:\nWhat's in a name?

Ubuntu change it's file permissions also after plug it... \n(sorry for bad English :/ )\n\nA: That looks like your main filesystem has some errors, mounting as read-only (the Read-only file system message) and the checks at bootup aren't fixing them. Did you try pressing f to attempt to fix it when it said to?  If it doesn't fix it automatically you may need to log into a recovery mode or with a live cd/usb/dvd and then fsck your partitions\nSee man fsck.ext4 , you'll probably want to use fsck.ext4 -f /dev/sda1 or whatever your partitions are called. Use lsblk or sudo blkid to see what's what. If they're not all ext, then plain fsck should figure out the type on it's own.\nIt looks like at least the home or / has errors. Try looking at what's mounted with ro (has ro in the ()'d options at end of each line) from the mount command. You can only safely fsck an ext-type partition when it's not mounted, so may need to boot live to do that. If the external hard drive has errors too it should be fsck'd also.\nAnd to help avoid filesystem errors in the future, unmount partitions (hard disks, usb's, everything) before you turn them off or remove them. Just unplugging them (or unplugging the computer) could corrupt filesystems.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04: Installation of `vega` package of `npmjs` I need to install vega package of npmjs (See here).

As vembutech already answered Number 1, here's number 2:\nThe first user being created during install is an admin user and you can use that one to log into, go to the dash (the upper-left icon on your screen) and type \"user\" there.  You will see an icon \"User accounts\".  Click it and use that screen to define a standard user by pressing on the little + in the lower left corner. (everything from there on should be straightforward)\nAs you're new to Ask Ubuntu: Don't thank anyone on this site, but accept their answer as valid if it helped you...  That is the best way of thinking people as their reputation will go up!  ;-)\n", "Q: Does every program have to go through the shell to complete the process they willing to make? I have seen somewhere that \"bash is used to communicate with the Linux kernel.\" \nIs it applicable only to the terminal? Or does every program (including programs which has GUIs) have to go through the shell to complete the process they willing to make?\n(Consider we are coloring a photo. How does bash know what we are doing? Is there a third party between gimp and bash to convert them to bash?)\nIt would be really helpful if can you take an example to explain :)\n\nA: Nope. Only users have to go through a shell to communicate with the Kernel. Applications use APIs.\nFor example, if I want to delete a file, I have to use one shell or the other, and then an application to delete the file:\n\n\n*\n\n*With a Command-Line Interface (CLI) shell, such as bash, I can use the rm command to delete the file.\n\n*With a GUI shell (like Unity, or GNOME Shell), I can use something else, such as the File Manager to delete the file. The GUI shell does not, in turn, need to use a CLI shell.\n\n\nBoth the File Manager and rm in turn may use the unlink(3) (or the higher level remove(3)) function (or system call) to do the actual work.\n", "Q: Too many authentication failures for root in filezilla So I finally made the move in my office to Ubuntu!

How can I edit permanently a makefile?\n\nA: What command are you using to compile? It sounds like the compiling system is automatically generating a Makefile, which overwrites the version you're editing. You may need to edit the file the compilation program uses to generate the Makefile instead. For example, if you're using autotools (the standard \"./configure; make; sudo make install\" deal) you should edit Makefile.am or Makefile.in.\n\nA: Make the file immutable with chattr +i Makefile command.

Built my laptop (dual with Win7) with 64 bit 13.10 in January of this year.  Added a lot packages (Chrome, LibreOffice, PipeLight w/Wine patches (for NetFlix), et al).  Got everything working.  Never had a problem with wireless.\nGot busy doing other stuff and did not boot Linux again till last week.  Now, wireless does not work.  Connects but you can not ping the router.  No changes whatsoever to the Linux build since last used.  Only thing that changed was the Comcast router.  I had to upgrade -- man I hate Comcast.  Anyway, the only difference I found with the router is that it hands out 10. addresses instead of 192.168. addresses out of the box.  I know this as I had some fixed IPs on some PCs and had to change them.  But I can't figure out why my wireless is wacked.  So, before I do anything drastic like rebuilding the whole shebang, I figured, I would ask here and see if anyone can point out what I have overlooked.

I don't like some of the default settings for keyboard shortcuts. However, I cannot figure out how to customize them.\nFollowing this question, here is what I have tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*I installed dconf-editor and changed can-change-accels to true.\n\n*I Opened evince with UBUNTU_MENUPROXY=0 evince.\n\n*I hovered mouse pointer over an entry (say,Find), and typed my desired shortcut (say,/).\n\n\nBut the corresponding shortcut isn't altered. I actually didn't recognize any change at all.\nIs there anything I did wrong? What is the correct procedure to customize keyboard shortcuts for evince?\n\nA: Did you try this? (The old school method!)\nThere is a file you can edit by hand to set keyboard shortcuts however you like.  The \"accels\" file is in your home folder, in .config/evince.  This file has rows like this:\n(gtk_accel_path \"<Actions>/BookmarsPopupActions/OpenBookmark\" \"<Primary>o\")\n\nYou will find the same style of config file in many other programs:\nGimp:  in ~/.gimp/menurc.\nGeeqie: in ~/.config/geeqie/accels.\nThe semi-colon you find at the front of most lines is a comment symbol--they disable the following.\nThe modifier keys are referred to as <Primary> <Shift>  and <Meta>. For most keyboards, these are Control, Shift, Alt. If you don't want a modifier, you don't need one.\nI suggest you close the app in question and edit the accels file. \nIt appears to me only tricky part in this is knowing what should be in the middle of the config line.  In apps like Gimp and Geeqie, the accels file is an exhaustive list of all the allowed shortcuts. All are commented out by semicolons at beginning of line.  In Evince, the accels file in my home is pretty skimpy, not too many accels to fix. \n", "Q: Xubuntu 14.10 - after upgrade from 14.04 CPU Scaling not working I upgraded my system from 14.04 to 14.10 and after that indicator-cpufreq was showing only two options: powersave and performance.

In an effort to recover data from a troublesome external hard drive, I accidentally filled up my Home folder with recovered data. I managed to send it to the trash, but then I didn't have enough free disk space to empty it. Now I don't have enough free space to even boot the desktop.  From the Live CD's GParted I can see that there is -no- space left on that partition. What can I do from here?\n\nA: The trash is usually located in ~/.local/share/Trash. If you can login using a TTY, or mount the partition containing your home directory, that's the folder you want to delete:\nrm -r .local/share/Trash\n\nIf you mounted your partition on a live CD, you would need to do:\nrm -r /media/ubuntu/<Partition Name>/home<your user name>/.local/share/Trash\n\nor some path like that, depending on where the mount point is, exactly. You can use the df, mount or lsblk commands to find out where it is mounted.\nTo log in to a TTY, boot into your Ubuntu, then press CtrlAltF2 (any function key from F1 through F6 would do). You can log in to a terminal and execute the first command, since you should be in your home directory.\nInstead of doing an rm, you can always use mv to move the folder elsewhere. In case you're not feeling too selective, just do:\nmv .local/share/Trash /some/where/else\n\nand press CtrlC when you feel a reasonable number of files have been moved.\n", "Q: Gnome focus mode I know this should be a silly question, but how do I change the window/terminal focus mode in Ubuntu 14.04.1 running GNOME Flashback (Compiz) [3.8.4]?\n\nA: Install gnome tweak tool (gnome-tweak-tool), and there you have the option under \"Windows\" -> \"Window focus mode\"\n", "Q: Hearthstone on chromebook (Samsung) I've installed ubuntu with crouton (version 12.04 of ubuntu) and wonder if there's a chance I can install games like hearthstone on it, and if so, how?\nI'm aware that it's not a laptop for games and such, but would be really intrested in trying it out.\nThe version of the chromebook is a Samsung XE503C12-K02SE\nThanks\n\nA: Download Game from Blizzard\nhttp://dist.blizzard.com/downloads/hs-installers/a6029a1d625c79252defff3914fb6e67/retail.1/Hearthstone-Setup-enUS.exe\n\nInstall Wine\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-wine/ppa\n\nsudo apt-get update\n\nsudo apt-get install wine\n\nInstall Hearthstone from Play on Linux.\nSource/Full Guide: http://www.sysads.co.uk/2014/04/install-hearthstone-heroes-warcraft-ubuntu-wine/\n", "Q: matlab 2014b glnxa64/jre/bin/java: Syntax error: \"(\" unexpected I'm trying to install Matlab 2014b on Ubuntu 14.10, after giving \nsudo ./install\n\nit immediately exits with\n/tmp/mathworks_7552/sys/java/jre/glnxa64/jre/bin/java: 1:\n/tmp/mathworks_7552/sys/java/jre/glnxa64/jre/bin/java: Syntax error: \"(\" unexpected\n\nCan you help me, please??\n[EDIT] The lines where I think it stops (install_unix script)\ncopyJREAndJarsToTmp () {\n#\n# Copy JRE and Jars to tmp\n#\necho \"Preparing installation files ...\"      NEW_JRE_LOC=\"$TEMP_DIR/sys/java/jre/$ARCH/jre\"\ncopyDirWritable \"$JRE_LOC\" \"$NEW_JRE_LOC\"\nJRE_LOC=$NEW_JRE_LOC\nJAVA_DIR=\"$TEMP_DIR/java\"\nJAR_LOC=\"$JAVA_DIR/jar\"\nJAREXT_LOC=\"$JAVA_DIR/jarext\"\ncopyDirWritable \"$ROOT/java\" \"$JAVA_DIR\"\n}\n\n\nA: You need to change the JRE_LOC variable value and it works fine.\nFor this,\ncomment the line (inside the install file)\nJRE_LOC=$NEW_JRE_LOC\n\nand add path of the jre inside the matlab folder you have.

I have even tried adding a second account, complete with password and public keys, but I can't log into these either.\nWhy would some machines commission correctly and others not?  Any ideas?\n\nA: The problem appears to have been caused by the physical clocks being not in sync enough with the server and critical parts of the commissioning happen before they run ntpdate.  I installed 3 commissioning files to sync ntpdate and the hardware clock.\n01-ntpdate - syncs with ntpdate and then writes to the hardware clock\n#!/bin/sh<BR>\n/usr/sbin/ntpdate -v 143.207.7.23<BR>\n/sbin/hwclock -w\n\n01-ntpdate-cron - installs a cron job to sync type every 15 minutes and set the hwclock\n#!/bin/bash    \ncat <<EOF >/etc/cron.d/ntpdate\n0,15,30,45 * * * * /usr/sbin/ntpdate 143.207.7.23 && /sbin/hwclock -w\nEOF\n\n01-S10ntpdate - installs a boot up script to sync time (and hwclock) on bootup\n#!/bin/sh -e\ncat <<EOF >/etc/init.d/ntpdate\n\n#!/bin/sh -e\n/etc/init.d/ntpdate\n/usr/sbin/ntpdate -v 143.207.7.23\n/sbin/hwclock -w\nexit 0\nEOF\n\nchmod +rx /etc/init.d/ntpdate\nln -s /etc/init.d/ntpdate /etc/rc2.d/S10ntpdate \nls -l /etc/init.d/ntpdate /etc/rc2.d/S10ntpdate\nexit 0\n\nAfter adding these 3 commissioning files, the first commissioning installs them and actually sets the hwclock (and usually fails the commissioning because the fails before it actually sets the time correctly).  The next commissioning runs successfully.\n\nA: Also, set up a local ntp server, and in /etc/maas/preseeds/preseed-master look for:\nd-I      clock-setup/ntp-server    string  ntp.ubuntu.com\nand change ntp.ubuntu.com to your ntp server's IP or machine name.\n", "Q: Why can't I lauch Unity Tweak Tool I tried to launch the Unity Tweak tool, which had been working fine before, and it wouldn't work at all.

In the installer I cant see the SSD in the dropdown menu (the one where you choose the hard drive for the installation) but if I try to specify the partitioning myself I can format the SSD and then allocate some space for Ubuntu. How can I install Ubuntu without losing my Windows 7 partition?\n\nA: If I understand the problem properly...\nThe best would be first to arrange a separate partition for Ubuntu. If the entire disk is used now for Win7, you would need to shrink the Win7 partition by a chosen amount and then what's left use for Linux partition.\nHowever - if you're not sure what you're doing there's a chance you may lose you windows data - so better be careful. Backup would be recommended.\nTo resize the partition(s) you can use gparted - it should be also in Ubuntu Live, which you can also use later to install your Ubuntu system on the disk.\n\nA: it seems like your windows partition is expanded to fit the whole disk. this is a simple fix. Press start on your windows OS. then right click on computer, then, from the drop down, press manage. then press disk management. then find your C: drive that windows is installed on, right click it, and press shrink. Then, shrink the volume to an appropriate size. then reboot back into the ubuntu install. then click on \"Something else\" when you get to that point.

However to better Demonstrate this next piece.  Grab a CRT monitor, then grab an LCD monitor with only VGA connections.  Then briefly look at Hz for those monitors.  Now, understand that monitors are going to fully depend on what your refresh rate is going to be.  Normally you can override those values in your Graphics Adapters Settings Page; however you get to those, sometimes doesn't matter.  \nYour adapter is finding the right rate:pixel ratio the monitor can handle, since this is how many times you can refresh a page on the screen every X amount of seconds.\nhttp://modia.com/what-is-refresh-rate.aspx is a more detailed understanding of what my question just answered.

I have a pending update for \"Get Hot New Stuff\" for the KDE Platform (libknewstuff2-4).\nI don't recall installing anything with KDE dependencies (I'm using vanilla Ubuntu), so I tried to figure out why it's there.\nI found that I can use \napt-cache rdepends --installed libknewstuff2-4\nto find installed packages that depend on this. This leads me to the package python-kde4. Upstream of this package are: python-qt4 and python-keyring.\nAt this point, things get hard to follow. qt-4 seems to have a circular dependency back to python-kde4. I think I can trace -keyring back to bzr, but I also see python-crypto upstream from -keyring. -crypto has more rdepends than I care to investigate...\nIs there a better way to understand what's going on here?\nAlternatively, does it make sense that I'm getting kde libraries based on a package that isn't KDE specific (like bzr)?\nEDIT: Using aptitude why as recommended below seems to automate what I manually did with apt-cache:\n$ aptitude why libknewstuff2-4 \ni   bzr                 Depends    python-bzrlib (>= 2.6.0+bzr6593-1ubuntu1.1)\ni A python-bzrlib       Recommends python-launchpadlib                        \ni A python-launchpadlib Depends    python-keyring (>= 0.5)                    \ni A python-keyring      Suggests   python-kde4                                \ni A python-kde4         Depends    libknewstuff2-4 (>= 4:4.13.3)              \n\nAlthough I'm not sure what the \"Recommends\" and \"Suggests\" states mean. The man page says:\n\nNote that the dependency that aptitude produced in this case is only a\n  suggestion. This is because no package currently installed on this\n  computer depends on or recommends the ... package; if a stronger\n  dependency were available, aptitude would have displayed it.\n\nSo what does it really mean that python-keyring \"suggests\" python-kde4, and do I have a choice in pulling in this \"dependency\"?\n\nA: Another way to find out why this was installed would be to zgrep libknewstuff2 /var/log/apt/* (you may have to use sudo).

But I have no idea on how to do this. I did try auto-mounting it at boot-up. But this didn't work. I suspect that is because my home folder is encrypted. I did this in fstab, using the following format.\nUUID=####... /home/user/destination    ext4    defaults        0       0\nwhen doing this the folder shows up empty. I have tried using Disk to setup an auto-mount.

This way your cron script runs after you decrypt your home directory.\nI've had to mount some SMB shares this way because fstab would fail every time.\n", "Q: Accidentally deleted Win 8 while installing Ubuntu 14 My problem is that I accidentally deleted Win 8.

The Internet says these are image files that do not execute the way the YouTube videos show they should work.\nWhat do I need to do differently in order to install the Ubuntu software on the net book?\n\nA: To create a bootable USB for Ubuntu, you can follow this excellent guide from Ubuntu's own website. See Ubuntu's website for the guide here!\nI'm guessing that you're a present Windows user, that's why I'll give you a link for the windows guide. If I'm wrong, there should more of these guides for other OS's as well.\nGood luck,\n", "Q: Mounted btrfs will [not] compress? I have a partition formated to btrfs and im willing to store there stuff that I don't use that often but which I need fast access from time to time (some dumps of my PS2 games for now) because I have read that btrfs can work wonders compressing data on the fly.\nThe thing is even when mounting this partition using the compress-force=zlib option I can't notice any compression work at all.\nCurrently my /etc/fstab file display the following info for the drive in question:\nLABEL=Emu /mnt/Emu btrfs compress-force=zlib,nosuid,nodev,nofail,comment=x-gvfs-show 0 0\n\nThe drive mounts fine and data can be written and read back. But no compression work is done, not with old files nor with new ones.\nSo far I've tested it by doing the following:\n$ sudo dd if=/dev/sda6 of='/mnt/Emu/dummy.txt' bs=1M count=1024\n$ sudo btrfs fi sync /mnt/Emu\n$ sudo du -h '/mnt/Emu/dummy.txt'\n\nThis generated a 1 GB file in said drive and told me the size of the file is indeed 1 GB so nothing has been compressed.\nAlso verified the size after using chattr +c on said dummy file and then defragmenting the file/drive by using btrfs fi defragment on them.\nAny pointing?\nMy systems specs:\n\n\n*\n\n*OS: Ubuntu 14.04 x86_64\n\n*Kernel: 3.13.0-40-generic\n\n*Btrfs: v3.12\n\n\nA: See Will btrfs automatically compress existing files when compression is enabled? on best practices compressing with btrfs:\n\n\n*\n\n*The command is btrfs fi defrag not btrfs fi sync\n\n*it must be applied to file, btrfs fi defrag /mnt/Emu/dummy.txt not to dir\n\n*how exactly do you decide it is not compressed? df is not showing proper sizes.\n\n", "Q:

(see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4510640/command-line-what-is-the-purpose-of )\nSo after updating (with sudo apt-get update), just do a \nsudo apt-get upgrade\n\nor\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\non another line/command (if you don't want to use || or ;). \nYou should also verify your sources list is still valid (to get rid of the errors in your apt-get update command so you can do &&, and makes it run faster) - so check all your warnings \"W:\" for source URLs and make sure they are current; if they've been discontinued, just remove them from your software sources. \nEDIT:\nTo remove software sources (I'm assuming you use Unity):\nGo to Software Centre > Edit > Software Sources (or run 'software-properties-gtk'). \nThen scroll down on the \"Software Sources\" tab and uncheck the repositories giving you trouble. (You should add the new updated repositories if you still want software from them. For Xorg Edgers, check out & read https://launchpad.net/~xorg-edgers/+archive/ubuntu/ppa ).\n\nA: I also underwent the same scenario once I installed the Ubuntu Operating system on my laptop. Try this. \nOpen the terminal and type the below command and execute. \n\nsudo apt-get update\n\n", "Q: Getting I.P address of Ubuntu Server running in Virtual Box I have installed Ubuntu Server 14.04.1 LTS in VirtualBox. I would like to get the I.P address, and according to https://askubuntu.com/a/430855/192526, you do so with\nip addr show\n\nIt says\n\ninet 127.0.0.1/8 scope host\n\nSo it would seem like I have an issue with my network adapter. However, I don't really know what settings am I supposed to be using:\n\nWhat do I do to be able to get my actual I.P address from Ubuntu Server running in VirtualBox for Mac OSX?\nI ask this because eventually I will want to setup an NTP server, and I imagine that a remote computer will need the I.P address of my Ubuntu Server.\n\nBy request, here is what ifconfig says:\n\n\nAnother curious thing:\nWhen booting, there is a message saying \n\nWaiting for network configuration...\n\nthat lasts for quite a long while until it apparently gives up saying \n\nBooting system without full network configuration\n\n\nA: You don't have an IP address because you have not configured one.  To do so you need to edit /etc/network/interfaces.  If you want one to be obtained automatically, add eth0 to the auto line in the file, and add a new line for it that reads iface eth0 inet dhcp.  You can then reboot or run sudo ifup -a to bring up the interface and obtain the IP address.  See man interfaces for more information.\n\nA: I used \"About This Computer...\" menu item to get computer's name and later ping command to get its IP. I hope this will be helpful for you.\n\n", "Q: some libraries are missing in 14.04 I want to install MySQL Workbench Community,but in terminal when I attempt to install It always says to me libnetcdf6 is missing and gives error.

Seems that even if I had the right approach to cleaning up mount, I couldn't execute it cause of the other errors which the problem with mount is preventing me from fixing. \nHow can I get package management working again? \nThanks in advance for your help.\n\nA: Probably worth posting the contents of /etc/apt/sources.list for a more accurate diagnostic.\nHowever, have you done a,\nsudo apt-get update\n\nRecently ?\n", "Q: How can I remove a clickable bar with hyperlink in each page of a pdf file? Can we remove a long narrow clickable bar(with some hidden text and link) at the bottom of each page of this pdf file? When never I click it, it will tries to open a website in my browser.\nI prefer to do that from command line, because there may be a pdf file with more pages with such bars.\nI tried https://superuser.com/a/536644/9265, but it only can remove the text in the bar, and the bar and the hyperlink still exist.\nThanks.\n\nA: Removing Links\nYou can remove embedded links (inserted by authoring applications or by Acrobat). Here’s how to do so in Acrobat X or XI:\nChoose Tools > Document Processing > Remove All Links\n", "Q: Cannot uninstall Ubuntu... boot problems I've been trying to remove Ubuntu from a laptop (separate issue), but I've not been able... any suggestions will be appreciated. Here some details:\n\n\n*\n\n*Dell Inspiron laptop, 32 bit, no UEFI secure boot \n\n*Have Edubuntu (version of Ubuntu 12.04) installed \n\n*Single Installation (does not have dual boot) \n\n*If I try to boot using a windows installation CD, it simply does not, it starts reading from the CD, for about 30 seconds,and then boots Ubuntu. \n\n*BIOS correctly set to boot from CD drive first. Hard drive formatted as ext4 Since I cannot get the CD started, I cannot get the MBR fixed, so I cannot use the fix above.\n\n\nCould it be that Windows installer cannot see a \"viable\" hard drive to install since cannot work with ext4?\nAny ideas? Thanks!\n\nA: Windows installation disks typically require you to \"Press any key to boot from CD\" before it fully boots. The fact that the CD loads for about 30 seconds makes it sound like for some reason you're supposed to be doing this but the message is not being displayed for some reason. Try spamming the space bar when you hear the CD running.\nWith regards to not being able to see the hard disk, what you're thinking would not be the case. Even though the partiton is formatted as ext4, Windows would still be able to see the physical disk.\nSo, if pressing the space bar doesn't work, you might want to check the disk you made in another computer, it could be defective.\n\nA: Try installing windows from a usb stick instructions here.\nHow can I create a Windows bootable USB stick using Ubuntu?\nto find the iso just google your windows version number iso.\n\nA: Refer to this article. This has similarities to your problem.\nhttp://www.howtogeek.com/howto/17903/remove-ubuntu-or-xp-from-the-windows-7-boot-menu/\n\nA: boot into ubuntu using CD choose \"Try Ubuntu\" connect to internet, open up a terminal window using alt-t then issue : boot-repair\nif boot-repair is not found, then install it :\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair &&\nsudo apt-get update &&\nsudo apt-get install -y boot-repair &&\nboot-repair\nclick Recommended Repair.

On my Ubuntu Server, 14.04.1 LTS, I have not specified any devices in /etc/network/interfaces, yet they (multiple ethernets) work completely as intended with static IP.\nI have heard from multiple sources that that file is the only place where the network configuration is taken from, but clearly this can't be the case as mine only contains the bare minimum for loopback and local interfaces.\nNetwork Manager is not installed on this machine.\nHow does Ubuntu Server manage devices not declared in /etc/network/interfaces?\n\nA: I don't know if your setup is anything like mine but if so it could clarify.\nI am behind a NAT router with port 80 open and forwarded to internal IP 192.168..\nI have a static external IP and I have not configured my network interfaces file.\nUpon install Ubuntu configures the network interfaces file to display a static IP on eth0\nI then have nginx so when the traffic comes to my external IP my router sends it to my server and then nginx takes care of the rest.\nHope this helps :) \n\nA: Check if there is any command in rc.local file cat /etc/rc.local\nIt should be empty by default\n", "Q: Pass p12 file without password to L2tp I have p12 file which I want to feed to l2tp to create a vpn connection.

Chromium and Opera even though based on the same engine do not bundle the DRM tools needed by Netflix.\nIs unsure when/if Opera or Chromium will open the doors to DRM. Mozilla said that they will not implement EME directly, instead will support it via 3rd party sand boxed stuff sometime in the future.\n", "Q: Homestead in Ubuntu I am editing my question regarding the benefits of Homestead vs. just installing each individual component without using Virtual box and/or Vagrant. I am new to Ubuntu --less than 2 weeks since I first installed-- and PHP so I appreciate any input. If you choose to use Homestead instead of just installing each of its components --PHP, SQL, etc..-- individually, can you update Homestead in one step using the command line in Ubuntu or do you have to update each of its components individually. If so, how do you do that? Your answer will help me to decide if I am going to install Homestead ---along with Virtual Box and Vagrant of course-- or not.\n\nA: The main motive I think is to created isolated dev/staging environments. You can also make use of containers e.g. Docker.\n\nA: Also, if using the Homestead box, you can be sure that every module is up on your server, and you wont have to manually install packages for making something (like certain artisan commands) work. \n", "Q: ibus override my xmodmap I use xmodmap to swith Ctrl and Alt keys:\n~ $> cat .Xmodmap\n!\n! based on: http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/SwapControlAltAndCapsLock#toc8\n!\n\n!----------------------------------------------------------\n!

I want all my user directories (Music, Downloads etc) in that removable media. I modified the .config/user-dirs.dirs file to point to directories in $HOME which have symbolic links to directories in the removable media. But every time I restart my computer, the directories reset to $HOME/ instead of, for example, $HOME/downloads -> /media/username/removablemedia/downloads.\nMy guess is that when I log into Ubuntu xdg-user-dirs-update runs before the SD card gets mounted. Since it cannot find the directories (symlinks point to void as of now), it defaults to $HOME/. I know this because when I change the values in .config/user-dirs.dirs to directories in my $HOME, the changes persist.\nSo is there a way I could make Ubuntu such that it mounts the SD card first and then executes xdg-user-dirs-update?\n\nA: Sorry for the extremely late reply, but there are 2 solutions to your problem:  \n\n\n*\n\n*Do system-wide mounting rather than per-user mounting.  \n\n*Prevent xdg-user-dirs-update from running (and resetting your configuration at each session start up) by adding enabled=False to your user-dirs.conf file as mentioned here.\n\nA: If your theory on broken links is correct, you can try to create placeholder files/directories in the directory where you expect the removable media to mount so the symlinks will not appear broken. When the removable media is mounted it will be on top of your placeholders.\n", "Q: Ubuntu General Instability / crash triggers Windows 8.1 startup repair Let me begin with my usual statement that I only ask questions on StackExchange sites when I can't find anything on Google, and that my question-asking skills are rusty, so forgive me blah blah blah...\nSo, this question is a two-parter. I would normally separate these into two separate questions, but they are both dealing with the same issues, more or less, so I feel this is most appropriate.\nFirst part: General instability. Or, \"Why is my system so unstable?\"\nIt seems like every time I leave this particular machine/system on for extended periods of time (see details at bottom), it will randomly kernel panic, crash, or just freeze completely. The longest uptime I've recorded is about 18 hours. This is probably the most pathetically unstable Linux distro (or machine?) I've ever run. Even Windows Vista would run for at least 20 hours (albeit with a random 10-20 minute lock-up about 5 hours in). It's like watching an old man with acute laryngitis during a particularly extreme coughing fit. In other words, it's disturbing. It's not like I run a bunch of heavy software, either. The most cpu-intensive app I use is Firefox, and even then, I make a point to use wget instead of firefox's downloader, and stream youtube videos via vlc as opposed to dealing with Flash's lagginess (Flash actually runs pretty decently on this machine. So this is more of an old habit). \nThe last system I ran (Linux Mint 15 32-bit on a dell inspiron laptop) could go on for months before some strange thing happened forcing me to reboot, like the sound daemon crashing and refusing to start back up properly, or getting logged out and having the system unable to accept my password, or the, then-rare, \"not syncing\" kernel panic (which is all-too-common for me now). The longest uptime I had on that one was an impressive 4 months and 3 days before the motherboard finally fried itself during a power surge and I had to buy this one (as well as a surge protector / battery backup to prevent that from happening again).\nSo that's the situation with the general instability. Now let's move on to the second part. \nPart 2: the strange experience I had today. Or, \"Why did a Ubuntu crash trigger Windows 8.1 startup repair?\"\nI went to an appointment today. I was also in the middle of a huge file-organizing operation with my Music and Video libraries. So I decided to leave the computer on, against my better judgement (see part 1). When I got back, I found my appliances showing the telltale signs of a power outage. So I checked on my computer to see if the backup battery had done its job, and I was half-delighted to see the power light was on. But when I turned my monitors on, I was greeted by the Windows 8.1 startup repair. This...makes absolutely no sense. For one, I haven't known Ubuntu (or any flavor of Linux, for that matter) to automatically reboot, even in the event of a crash. For another, I wasn't even running Windows. And the last time I was, it was a perfectly clean shutdown. Why would Ubuntu crashing cause Windows to \"need\" a startup repair? As far as I know, there's no way that a system on a separate partition could affect the other partition if the other partition wasn't mounted.\nI have been having some of the most perplexing problems with this setup, but this one just takes the cake.\nI've never been sure which logs I should be copy/pasting, but here is some highly detailed information about the state of my system before the crash (not to imply the crash did any real damage...it didn't), in case somehow some specific combination of software is capable of destroying a system's stability:\nHardware:      \n    Acer Aspire XC Tower \n    2 x Acer monitor\nOther:\n    Surge Protector/Backup Battery combo unit\n    Ethernet Cable to connect to internet\n    WiFi antenna.

Turns out, it's not Ubuntu. It can't be Ubuntu. It just looks like it is because my use of the Windows partition pales dramatically in comparison to my use of the Ubuntu partition. I'm sure that if I used Windows for long enough, it, too, would lock up eventually.\nIt's the CPU. I figured this out a few months ago when I started running scripts during my sessions to log what's going on, as well as setting up my magic key for being able to perform the beloved SysRQ + REISUB combo. Not only did all logs, including those dumped by the kernel, end abruptly in the event of a freeze, but the kernel wouldn't respond to any magic keys. Temperature is normal. Sound will loop like an N64 game when it freezes. Actually, the freeze is very similar to an NES/SNES/N64 freeze. Everything is normal, as if no freeze ever occurred, yet everything just abruptly stops in time. In short, somehow, the CPU is getting locked up. \nSo since the problem is the hardware and not Ubuntu, I'm taking the first half of this is question over to superuser.\n\nA: I may have skimmed through your question but, rule of thumb, Linux and Windows should stick to their own hard drives. They'll always try to take priority over each other, even on separate partitions.\n*Edit: I would try to not use any Windows repair tool while both OS's are partitioned on the drive. Gparted shouldn't mess anything up but, tools like it can confuse Windows, especially on boot up.\n", "Q: Make error for latex processing I want to execute the following Makefile:\nmain.pdf: main.tex main.bib\npdflatex main.tex\nbibtex main.aux\npdflatex main.tex\npdflatex main.tex\n\nIt comes from this site: http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Bibliography_Management#Why_won.27t_LaTeX_generate_any_output.3F.\nI type the command \"make\" in the same directory and get the following error message:\n\nmake: *** No rule to make target main.bib', needed bymain.pdf'. \n  Stop.\n\nI don't know how to procede.

(You should document your setup, so that you can recreate it whenever necessary and only need backups for restoring production data.)\nRestoring parts of an operating system to another existing system is a bad idea and will result in inconsistencies. For example copying contents of /usr from a desktop system to a server system will install contents without informing the package management system and will not update them with security updates. You should install the packages through the package manager instead. Copying /tmp on the other hand is almost pointless, because it is usually wiped upon reboot.\nBacking up and restoring a machine from a tar archive is meant for clean drives/partitions, where it is easy and just involves restoring data, writing the boot loader and probably replacing filesystem UUIDs.\n", "Q: Unable to Format USB Drive I have a 4.1 GB USB drive that has become unusable now.

I had Windows8 preinstalled. But I needed Ubuntu. So I tried to install Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. I totally cleared my HDD and I just clicked Install Ubuntu. After some time I got an error Installer crashed. I didnt understand whats happening so I tried to install Ubuntu 12.04 LTS. This installation crashed too. I had pretty same error, but here, in Ubuntu 12, I was able to see where the installation crashed. It has crashed when it was trying to install grub2. Its new laptop so it had UEFI. Seems like this grub is not appropriate for UEFI. (Although, when installation crashed, it destroyed my Win8, and before Installation Ubuntu didnt see her.)\nI have searched a bit and looks like I need to change grub or UEFI, but I didnt get how. And I dont want to break whole computer while changing UEFI.\nHow can I solve it? As I understand I need at least to upgrade grub to grub-efi on my liveUSB, but dont know how.\n\nA: Using unetbootin to create a boot disk for a UEFI (I tend to use the term EFI, though it's technically incorrect) system is a common mistake. unetbootin, last I checked is not EFI-aware and only makes BIOS-type boot disks. This is where the problem originates. Since unetbootin creates BIOS-type boots disks, you had to enabled BIOS mode in your EFI in order to boot it, forcing Ubuntu to install in BIOS mode, rather than EFI mode.\nSo, how do you fix this?\nGiven your information from the comments, we're going to use your second flash drive as it should be easiest.\n\n\n*\n\n*Back up your second USB to your other computer. This process will destroy everything on the second drive.\n\n*Boot up the Ubuntu drive you've already created, and tell it \"Try Ubuntu\", we'll be working from the LiveUSB.\n\n*Re-download the Ubuntu ISO from releases.ubuntu.com (it will be saved in RAM). Alternatively, if you've got Linux and the ISO on your other PC, you can do this process form there as well.\n\n*Once the download is completed, open a terminal.\n\n*cd ~/Downloads\n\n*Type mount\n\n*Now, plug in the second drive and once it shows up as plugged in, run mount again. We're trying to find the device name of the newly-plugged device. You will see a new entry in the second output that didn't exist in the first. It will start with something like this:\n/dev/sdX# on /media/ubuntu/[...]\n\nwhere X is a letter, # is a number and [...] may be the label of the drive or a random set of characters and dashes. It'll look something like /dev/sdc1, /dev/sdd1, /dev/sde1, etc. This is your second flash drive, hopefully. Take note of the /dev/sdX# part, we'll need it later in step 11.\n\n*To verify that it is, in fact your second drive, enter the command ls /media/ubuntu/[...] (The /media/ubuntu/[...] part is what shows up from the second mount command in step 6-7). If it's not the right drive, unplug the second USB again and repeat steps 6-7 again until you're sure you have the right drive and device name (i.e., /dev/sda1).\n\n*If the output of the ls command shows the file structure of your second USB drive (the one you're not booting off and the one that you don't mind wiping) then we're ready to go!\n\n*At this point, we're going to write this ISO directly to the second USB drive. This next command WILL destroy all data on your drive, so make sure you have backed up the drive and that you have selected the correct device (the /dev/sdX# part).\n\n*sudo dd if=ubuntu-14.04-desktop-amd64.iso of=/dev/sdX bs=1M (Note: drop the # off the /dev/sdX# above and just use the /dev/sdX part -- replacing the 'X' with the actual letter of course. /dev/sdc1 becomes /dev/sdc, /dev/sdd1 becomes /dev/sdd, etc.). After this you will have a fully bootable Ubuntu USB drive (both EFI and BIOS).\n\n*Now, reboot the computer and change the EFI settings back to EFI mode (i.e., not BIOS/Legacy/CSM mode).\n\n*Plug in the newly formatted USB drive and boot off it. That should be all there is to it, Ubuntu should boot and install in UEFI/EFI mode.\n\n", "Q: Packaging: /usr/lib vs. /usr/lib/*-linux-gnu I was building a new version of Spice within an LXC container, mostly for experimentation. However, one strange thing that I encountered was that make install installed libspice-server.so.1.9.0 into /usr/lib. The result was a nasty segfault when using the QXL driver because of the fact that libspice-server.so.1.8.0 from the repositories was located in /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu, which has a higher precedence in ldconfig. So, it was dynamically linking the older version of the library with the newer code -- no good.\nAnyway, this got me thinking: Other than ldconfig ordering (which I don't think has anything to do with it) is there a functional or philosophical difference between placing a library in /usr/lib versus placing a library in /usr/lib/{x86_64,i386}-linux-gnu?\nI understand the need for separate /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu and /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu directories due to Debian not utilizing the /usr/lib /usr/lib32 hierarchy used by some other distros. But, do libraries that are directly in /usr/lib have some special significance, or it simply for backwards compatibility, perhaps?\n\nA: In Debian and Ubuntu, and indeed the FHS, /usr/lib and variants are \"owned\" by the vendor. In this case, that means your distribution. You should not be placing files there yourself at all. Of course you can do as you like, but tooling (such as dpkg) will just overwrite files you place there without prompting, because the system by design considers these spaces for distribution packages only. Your system is yours to break as you wish, but you also get to keep the pieces :-)\nThe space reserved for the system owner/administrator to place extra system-wide libraries is /usr/local/lib. This is in the FHS, so should be available and configured across all standards-respecting distributions. Upstream software should have make install place libraries there by default.\n\n...is there a functional or philosophical difference between placing a library in /usr/lib versus placing a library in /usr/lib/{x86_64,i386}-linux-gnu?\n\nDistribution packages that use /usr/lib can't have different architectures installed at once (such as i386 vs. amd64), which as others have pointed out is useful for desktops running both 32-bit and 64-bit software, and for developers running code built for other architectures by emulation. This is the sole reason for the multiarch subdirectories.\nThe same applies to libraries you install yourself. Whether you do that in /usr/lib or /usr/local/lib, you won't be able to have multiple architectures supported concurrently. You can always add multiarch paths like /usr/local/lib/{x86_64,i386}-linux-gnu to /etc/ld.so.conf.d/ to enable that of course.\n\nA: You are right, in a traditional system all libraries were installed in /usr/lib. As you already mentioned, the fact that users like to execute 32-bit binaries on 64-bit platforms is one of the reasons to separate libraries by their architecture. This approach is known as Multiarch (at least in the Debian world).\nIn addition, developers like to install libaries of other architectures (like ARM) to cross-compile their applications.\nThe FHS recommends to put 32-/64-bit libaries into the folders /usr/lib{32,64}. This approach is kind of inflexible as there is no support for other architectures (e.g. ARM). There even exist multiple 64-bit ABIs which are not compatible with each other and would end up in the same folder.\nFurther information:\n\n\n*\n\n*Debian Wiki: Multiarch Implementation\n\n*Ubuntu: Multiarch Spec\n", "Q: Find and execute multiple scripts in parallel G'day, \nI have tried to solve this problem all morning but have not had success. I would like to search for certain scripts in a particular folder and execute them all in parallel. The scripts have different names, but all end with \"run.sh\". Below what I have tried without success. \nThe first approach was to use find in combination with -execdir. This works, however, the scripts are executed in a sequantial fashion. I want all scripts to be executed simultaneously (parallel). There seems to be no option to achieve this with -execdir\nfind . -name \"*run.sh\" -type f -execdir 'nohup' {} '&' \\;\n\nThen, I tried using xargs because there is has a parallel option (-P). I have not tried the parallel option yet, because I am unable to get xargs to run the scripts in their respective subfolders. The commands below execute all scripts, but do that in the folder I am running the command in, therefore the scripts themselves do not work. The scripts have to be executed in their own subfolders. In the above example, -execdir is doing that as opposed to -exec. How do I achieve that with xargs?\nnohup find . -name \"*run.sh\" -type f | xargs -0 -I{} bash -c f\\ \\{\\}\n\nor\nnohup find . -name \"*run.sh\" -type f | xargs -0 -I{} bash -c \"f {}\"\n\nor\nnohup find . -name \"*run.sh\" -type f | xargs -0 -I{} bash -c \"./{}\" \n\nI am really frustrated and am hoping that there is somebody out there that can help. \nThank you so much!\n\nA: Inspired by choroba's answer:\nfind . -iname '*run.sh' -printf 'cd %h; ./%f\\0' | xargs -L1 -0 -P0 bash -c\n\nYou can use -printf to build the command line. %h is the directory where the file is located, and %f is the name of the file without the path (the basename). The -P option enables parallelism in xargs, and -L1 -0 makes it use one null-terminated line of input per command.\n\nA: What about creating the command lines you want to run, then running them?\nfind . -name '*run.sh' -type f -exec \\\n    echo 'c={}; cd ${c%/*} && nohup \"./${c##*/}\" &' \\;\n\nIf the output is what you want, just append | bash and run again.\n", "Q: Disable Login Prompt after Screensaver I want the screensaver on, but when I move the mouse over the screen, I don't want to be prompted for the password.\nIs there any way of doing this?\nI see that the screensaver setting has been removed since version 11, and been replaced with GNOME Screensaver.\n\nA: Yes go into screen saver lock settings under system settings and disable prompt for password on resume and or screensaver...\n", "Q: problem new with ubuntu and i cannot install I have neu cd ubuntu 12.04.

You will see the time stamp of the first message, which apparently is repeated 14 times with 6 seconds in between, thus showing up 84 seconds (and a bit) later in the log.Generally, if you look at the output of grep -a3 -b3 repeated /var/log/syslog you will see that the repeated message has a different time stamp from those before and after.\n", "Q: how to make keyboard to press ctrl key after every 5 minutes?

And unfortunately not all of the programms support multiple profiles to change it without edditing the settings everytime.\nSo, my question is if it's possible to have the same hostname on the inside. Let's say my DNS on the outside is myserver.homelinux.org. The server is called \"server\" so I can only access the server from the inside via the URl server.local.\nI've tried to change it to myserver.homelinux.org and stuff like that. I changed the shortname to myserver and the FQDN full Hostname to myserver.homelinux.org but it didn't work. The server was not accessible via myserver.homelinux.org from the inside, but via myserver.local. I changed it with\nsudo hostname myserver\n\nand\nsudo hostname -f myserver.homelinux.org\n\nand of course eddited /etc/hosts file. Still, nothing\nSo, what did I do wrong? Is it even possible? What do I have to do, to access it local and external with the same address?\n\nA: In Ubuntu sudo vim /etc/hostname put the FQDN. Then feel free to conform your /etc/hosts. Example below. Feel free to add your hostname.local naming scheme.\n127.0.0.1   localhost.localdomain   localhost\n127.0.1.1   hostname.yourdomain.tld hostname\nYourIP      hostname.yourdomain.tld hostname\n\nIf you want your remote server to be reachable over the internet via its FQDN, then you need to create the relevant DNS records.

The workstation is however mostly used remotely from a windows computer.\nI installed windows on one partition and linux on the other (using grub2 for dual booting). I wrote an small shell script which reboots the computer into windows from linux unsing grub-reboot basically following https://wiki.debian.org/GrubReboot\n#!/bin/bash\ngksudo grub-reboot \"Windows 7 (loader) (on /dev/sda1)\"\n\nThis works perfectly and when rebooting windows starts and when rebooting again ubuntu starts.\nFor working trough remote connection I installed teamviewer, both on windows and ubuntu (teamviewer 9, directly from the teamviewer website).\nNow my problem is as following.\nWhen I start my computer I can use teamviewer without problem in Ubuntu. When I reboot to windows using the above script I can also use teamviewer. Next when I reboot from windows to Ubuntu I cannot connect to teamviewer. If I reboot again (which I cannot do when I am at a remote location) teamviewer works perfectly again in Ubuntu.\nI tried looking if (when I cannot use teamviewer) the the teamviewer service is running in Ubuntu. Which seems to be the case, because when I try the code below it tells me the service is running. If I stop and start the service again teamviewer still doesn't work.\nsudo teamviewer --daemon enable (or start)\n\nMy final (not perfect) solution to the problem would be to make a script which basicly reboots ubuntu once when it starts. I wrote a small shell script for it which I placed in the etc/init.d folder. The script basicly makes an .txt file and checkes if this is present. If the computer reboots teamviewer will work again. But this script gives problems. \n#!/bin/bash\nif [ ! -f /tmp/reboot.txt ];\nthen \n    echo \"test\" > /tmp/reboot.txt \n    sleep 3s\n    reboot\nelse\nfi\nexit 0\n\nThis script makes the reboot.txt but doesn't reboot. I also tried removing the else but when I did that it keeps rebooting continuously.\nCan someone either help me with my teamviewer problem, on how to easily solve the problem that it doesn't work. Or help me with my shell script on how to restart Ubuntu one time when it boots. This last solution definitely makes it possible for me to use teamviewer without problems and the extra 30 seconds wait for the extra reboot are no problem so I think that would be the most easy solution.\nUPDATE:\nI tried what MilliByte answered below without success. \n\nA: I'd change the script to read:\n#!/bin/bash\nif [ ! -f /tmp/reboot.txt ]\nthen \n    echo \"test\" > /tmp/reboot.txt \n    sync\n    reboot\nfi\nexit 0\n\nThe sync will flush changes to the file system before the reboot.\n", "Q: Unable tu mount 1.0 TB Volume When I connect mey Samsung S2 Portable 3 HDD, i get following message:\nUnable to Mount 1.0 TB Volume\nerror mounting /dev/sdb1 at /media/Reding/\nd45c6601-557e-4dbac-9ec8-247b68491a70: Commane-line `mount-t\n\"xfs\" -o \"uhelper=udisks2,node,nosuid\" \"/dev/sdb1\" \"/media/hreding/\nd45c6601-557e-4bac-9ec8-247b68491a70\" exited with non-Zero Exit\nstatus32: Mount:mount/dev/sdb1 on/media/hreding/\nd45c6601-557e-4bac-9ec8-247b68491a70 failed: No data avalaible.\n\nwhat can I do to get Access to the files on this HDD?\nThanks for any help\nhreding\n\nA: Open your terminal window :\n\n\n*\n\n*First create a directory, to which you are going to mount your HDD.\n\n\nsudo mkdir -p /media/Name_of_directory\neg : mkdir -p /media/storage\n\n\n*Run the below command to get the volume_id \nfdisk -l |grep GB\nDisk /dev/xvda1: 214.7 GB, 214748364800 bytes\nDisk /dev/xvdk: 107.4 GB, 107374182400 bytes\nDisk /dev/xvdn: 1099.5 GB, 1099511627776 bytes\nNote down the volume id for your 1 TB volume , \nIn this case :/dev/xvdn is the volume having 1TB\n\n\n*Then mount the volume ( /dev/xvdn ) to the created directory, \n\n\nsudo mount /dev/xvdn /media/storage\n\n\n*Now run df -h will list all your volumes, connected to the system,\n\n\nYou can access your files using, cd /media/storage.\n", "Q: SNMP Need to install on Ubuntu 14.04 when i run the command : sudo apt-get install snmpd is giving the following error\nroot@ubuntu:/home/ubuntu# sudo apt-get install snmpd                             Reading package lists...

Linux and NTFS have totally different concepts of users, groups and file permissions. This means it's not simple to translate permissions between systems. \nTo adjust NTFS permissions into Linux form NTFS3G has 2 possibilities: (a) just ignore what NTFS has and set all files and all directories to the same umasks; or (b) provided that user mapping was done, it attempts to guess what meaning of Linux permission are resulted from NTFS permissions of a paricular file/dir. \nIn case (a) Linux-supplied permissions are not stored anywhere and any attempts to change them are ignored. Case (b) reads and stores file permissions in NTFS. \n\nA: In the ext filesystem, which is used in Linux, inodes are used to describe stored files. An inode contains attributes of a file as well as its data block locations (these are the blocks that contain the actual contents of the file). The following is briefly what is stored in an inode:\nInode number\nFile access, modify and changed timestamps\nFile size\nPermissions\nOwner\nGroup\nData Block Locations\nSo to answer your question, Unix stores the permissions of a file in its inode, which is in the filesystem, for example ext4.\nIf you want to see the inode information of a file, you can use the stat command:\n$ stat /bin/bash\n  File: ‘/bin/bash’\n  Size: 635933          Blocks: 624        IO Block: 65536  regular file\nDevice: 2e208854h/773883988d    Inode: 281474976901122  Links: 1\nAccess: (0755/-rwxr-xr-x)  Uid: ( 1000/    Alaa)   Gid: (  513/    None)\nAccess: 2014-10-18 13:45:13.375853300 -0400\nModify: 2014-10-08 16:54:16.000000000 -0400\nChange: 2014-10-18 13:45:13.438253400 -0400\n Birth: 2014-10-18 13:45:13.375853300 -0400\n\nTo point out something in your question: by default, when you copy a file from a Linux distribution to another, the permissions are not copied. What happens is that the data blocks (the actual contents) are copied, but all the other attributes are not. So for example, if you are copying files from your internal to your external hard drive (both formatted as ext4), the owner of the copied data on the external hard drive becomes (I think) the user that did the copy command. If you wanted to preserve the permissions (and other attributes) of a file, you would have to use an extra flag, such as -p (or --preserve) in the cp command:\n   -p     same as --preserve=mode,ownership,timestamps\n\n   --preserve[=ATTR_LIST]\n      preserve   the   specified   attributes   (default:  mode,owner-\n      ship,timestamps), if possible  additional  attributes:  context,\n      links, xattr, all\n\nWhere mode is the permissions. Using options like the -p copies over those inode attributes to the new file.\nWindows uses the FAT32 or NTFS which are completely different filesystems that don't understand inodes. That's why, when you copy something from Linux (ext4) into Windows (NTFS or FAT32), Windows applies its own attributes to the file.\nWhen you mount an NTFS filesystem in Ubuntu, it sets permissions on everything in the partition using the umask command (or options fmask and dmask in fstab). When you copy something over to that mounted partition, those files take whatever the umask command entails, and the permissions cannot be changed unless you remount the whole partition with new options.\nFor more information, read the manpage of ntfs-3g here: http://linux.die.net/man/8/ntfs-3g.\n", "Q: how to check spreadsheet for input errors I was generating large XLS (Microsof Ofice Excel spreadsheet) file for a client with XML.

Get the free MS Office 365/MS Office Online/OneDrive then check it from the web.\n\nA: Huh, The whole issue seems to be the LibreOffice itself. I've installed Gnumeric which is not Java based (it's C based)  and it works well :) \nI'm just guessing that it's because LibreOffice is much more heavier (more features per single cell) so I guess Java didn't handle it with memory coverage.\nSo conclusion: my XLS was ok so all I needed to check was my XML with xmllint for any broken XML.

They can't boot from Live CD but not other way around as I am...or at least that's what I'm assuming the problem is. \nHere's what I did. I have an acer iconia tab w500 tablet (windows 7) with dvd-rom, 1TB usb3-hard drive and other stuff connected to it via USB, like a finger scanner) and I decided to try Ubuntu on a tablet. \nBurn the ISO to a DVD, booted from DVD, partitioned it to ext4 with swap and installed but soon as it restarts its just keep booting from the Live CD and not from where it s installed (the 1tb hard drive). \nIf I take the cd out, it just gives error like \"can't found live cd source\". By the way there is already Windows 7 installed on tablets internal storage(32GB) \nI installed Ubuntu on the external hard drive, so on the boot screen it asks which OS I want.\nBefore the installation the, tablet didn't boot from the Live CD and straight opened windows 7. I can't change BIOS settings and see which device is booting first (since I've got no external keyboard to press F2 after pressing correct buttons on the tablet).\nI had to choose this option from the Ubuntu Live CD menu in Windows to install this additional autorun setting.\n\nA: From reading all the comments I understand you tried to install Ubuntu using WUBI.EXE from within Windows.\nSee Is WUBI installation a full installation, or is it a live CD with persistent file or partition? and How do I know if I am running Wubi or a proper dual-boot? for more on WUBI.\nWUBI does not use the GRUB bootloader, but uses Windows' own bootloader. It looks like the Windows bootloader somehow got misconfigured to point to the LiveDVD instead of the correct boot initiation file probably something like c:\\ubuntu\\winboot\\wubildr.mbr.\nWithout Buying a Keyboard:\nYou can try to fix the Windows boot loader and make it point to the right file. See this HowToGeek for details.\nWith a keyboard:\nOr you can delete the WUBI install by booting Windows and using Control Panel > Programs > Unisntall a Program > Ubuntu. Then you will need to go into BIOS (using the keyboard you need to buy) and set the tablet to boot from the Live DVD and do a complete install (not WUBI).\nIf you installed Ubuntu in an external USB drive:\nRemember to put the bootloader (GRUB) in the same external USB drive. It may be /dev/sdb, /dev/sdc or some such thing. Don't put it in any specific partition such as /dev/sdb1 or /dev/sdc1 etc.\nOnce Ubuntu is installed, you may have to change the boot order in the BIOS again. Set it to the drive where Ubuntu is installed. If the external drive is attached it should show GRUB and give you the choice to boot Ubuntu (default) or Windows. If the drive is not present during boot, the tablet should boot straight to Windows.\n\nA: Have you tried using Boot-Repair-Disk from sourceforge.com. I have had the same issue using an external hard drive. When you boot-up the Boot-Repair-Disk, one of the questions it will ask is if one of your hard drives is external, answer YES and allow the disk to setup GRUB with your external drive. The Boot-Repair-disk download is free, just burn it to DVD, its a very good tool to have on hand. Hope this helps!! When you asked your question, you said you installed ubuntu on your 1TB internal hard drive that had windows on it, and at the end of your question you said you installed it on an external drive? If you installed it onto the external drive GRUB needs to know this to set up properly.\n\nA: If anyone thinks these images are OTT, please comment and I'll shrink them. I'm trying to be funny, I'm probably not managing\nThis is because the bios is in the wrong order. You need to set the external HDD as the first boot item.\nSolution? Buy one of these?\n        \n\nIs there another way to remove this without getting into BIOS? I'm not keen to walk to town just to buy a keyboard. If I could only now what did it changed I can undo it from windows.\n\nNope. You need to buy one of those.\nBIOS is the problem, BIOS is the fix.\n", "Q: Lost vlc after a partial upgrade - cannot reinstall due to unmet dependencies I am using Ubuntu 14.04, and run a partial upgrade via Update Manager.\nThis resulted in removing VLC.  \nI've tried reinstalling using sudo apt-get install vlc but got this error:  \n Some packages could not be installed.

You can then get a pad and paper and write these down.\n\"Address\" is the static IP for the laptop you would like to set (for example: 192.168.1.44). \n\"Netmask\" is usually 255.255.255.0 but it may differ depending on your router settings.\n\"Gateway\" is usually 192.168.1.1 but it may also differ depending on your router settings.\nFinally, DNS should be set to either the same IP as your Gateway (here in this example it would be 192.168.1.1) or to the IPs of DNS servers separated by a comma. For example, google dns is = 8.8.4.4,8.8.8.8\nClick \"save\". If you cannot click save, click \"cancel\" and try again.\nRun the following command to restart network-manager:\nsudo service network-manager restart\n\n\nA: I also used to face the same problem. And usually i was able to connect when i rebooted my pc then I found a way to just restart the wifi adapter.Open terminal and write\nsudo restart netwok-manager\n\nthis will restart your wifi driver and you will be able to reconnect.\n", "Q: Can't copy files on external 1 tb toshiba drive I cannot copy or create folders on an external drive.

I've decided to go with the dedicated home/data partition way of doing things for my first multiboot configuration, and for that reason have a bunch of symlinks linking to where I've mounted that partition. Everything works fine in the terminal, but when I use the GUI, it just opens up another window without having followed the link.\nExample: I click on the symlink named \"Documents\" in my home folder which should link to the \"Documents\" folder on my dedicated partition, but another window of my home folder pops up instead.\nAlso, when I'm saving a file for the first time and would like to navigate somewhere by way of the symlinks, the symlinks are treated as files rather than directories. When I click on one to follow it, the name of the file-to-be-saved is changed to the name of the symlink.\nI made the symlinks using terminal with ln -s, and I've managed the same procedure in Mint 17 without any problems with the GUI.\nAdditional info provided to comment questions:\nXDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP=Unity\n\nThe symlinks are absolute links.\nOne thing I've noticed is that the first time I open Files (right after I log in), all the links work. As soon as I follow one (unless I open in a new tab), they all stop working. I can rename a symlink and then it starts working, but only until I follow it again. Something definitely changes once I follow the symlink, because when I go back the symlinks are no longer arranged alphabetically with the other directories, they're arranged alphabetically with the other files. When I rename one, that seems to make it behave like a directory again because it moves to be alphabetically in line with the other \"regular\" directories. \nMaybe somebody knows of a file or something that gets modified once I change the name of a symlink or follow it...? \n$ ls -l\ntotal 48\ndrwxrwxr-x 1 funkyrailroad funkyrailroad  13 Mud  1 15:54 backup\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 funkyrailroad funkyrailroad  41 Mud  1 15:18 Desktop -> /mnt/temp/SnowLeopard/localadmin/Desktop/\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 funkyrailroad funkyrailroad  43 Mud  1 15:18 Documents -> /mnt/temp/SnowLeopard/localadmin/Documents/\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 funkyrailroad funkyrailroad  42 Mud  1 20:44 Downloads -> /mnt/temp/SnowLeopard/localadmin/Downloads\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 funkyrailroad funkyrailroad  39 Mud  1 15:19 eBooks -> /mnt/temp/SnowLeopard/localadmin/eBooks\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 funkyrailroad funkyrailroad  45 Mud  1 15:21 Google Drive -> /mnt/temp/SnowLeopard/localadmin/Google Drive\ndrwxrwxr-x 1 funkyrailroad funkyrailroad   2 Mud  5 20:55 made in terminal\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 funkyrailroad funkyrailroad  38 Mud  1 15:21 Music -> /mnt/temp/SnowLeopard/localadmin/Music\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 funkyrailroad funkyrailroad  41 Mud  1 15:21 Pictures -> /mnt/temp/SnowLeopard/localadmin/Pictures\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 funkyrailroad funkyrailroad  38 Mud  1 21:01 Public -> /mnt/temp/Ubuntu/funkyrailroad/Public/\n-rw-rw-r-- 1 funkyrailroad funkyrailroad 401 Mud  1 21:03 steps\n-rw-rw-r-- 1 funkyrailroad funkyrailroad 406 Mud  1 17:32 steps~\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 funkyrailroad funkyrailroad  40 Mud  1 20:54 Templates -> /mnt/temp/Ubuntu/funkyrailroad/Templates\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 funkyrailroad funkyrailroad  39 Mud  1 21:00 Videos -> /mnt/temp/SnowLeopard/localadmin/Movies\n\nI've mounted the data partition by editing fstab. It's nonjournaled hfs plus formatted because I want mac os x to be able to read it, and for lack of forethought I named the directory where it'll be mounted \"temp\". I used to access it by its UUID, but I must have done something weird and that partition no longer has a UUID, at least it doesn't show one when I run blkid, so I go by its /dev/sdax name. The relevant entry in /etc/fstab is:\n/dev/sda3 /mnt/temp hfsplus rw 0 2\n\nI've got the exact same setup on my Mint partition (and in the meantime my Zorin as well), and I can follow the symlinks with the GUI no problem. The messup with the UUID also affected my other setups, which still seem to work, so I'm tempted to think that the problem is elsewhere...\n\nA: I'm not sure if this is going to be an answer, but after reading and some comments, I have more ideas, and it's too much for a comment.\nSince I don't really know exactly how much you know about mounting drives, I may get too remedial at times, so forgive me if I seem to be talking down to you.  I just don't want to assume too much.\nFirst of all, you don't mention anything about how you are mounting the partitions. There are a few ways to do it, but if you don't explicitly mount it, using either the mount command, or an entry in the file /etc/fstab, then it will still show up in Nautilus, and get mounted automatically the first time you click on it; you will then see an icon to the right, the triangle over a line symbol, indicating that it's mounted (in /media/your_user_name/volume_label).  This might be contributing to what you have described, although it's hard to interpret exactly what you describe.  \nNow, I am going to describe how I do this, which works the way you desire. I mount all my partitions in /mnt/xxxxx.  This is owned by root, which is OK, but the directories I create, I set the owner:group to myself.  One of the directories I created is named /mnt/shared (because I first did this to share the data files with a Windows partition I used to have, and also other distros I was trying out).\nIn this shared directory, I mounted an ext4 partition (used to be NTFS until I ditched the Windows installation) containing directories such as \"Documents\", \"Downloads\", \"Music\", \"Pictures\", etc.  I labelled the partition \"shared\" (I label all partitions the same as the directory they mount in), and I use the label rather than the UUID to mount the partition; to me, this makes it easier, and even though there is some remote possibility I might label another partition with the same label, it has never happened, and for my personal system, I don't worry about it.  Anyway, in /etc/fstab, I have an entry that says:\nLABEL=shared  /mnt/shared ext4  defaults,user_xattr 0  3 \nSo, after booting, if all goes well, I will have a directory /mnt/shared/ containing all my directories in that partition.  Make sure you are the owner of this new folder, and if not, use the sudo chown your_name:your_name.\nSo next, I right-click on the /mnt/shared/Documents directory from Nautilus, and choose \"Make link\", which will create a file in the same directory called \"Link to Documents\".  Next, I cut and paste that link into my home directory, where the normal \"Documents\" folder resides. Assuming there are no important files or folders already in Documents (if there are, they should be moved temporarily to a temp folder), I then delete the Documents folder, and immediately rename \"Link to Documents\" to \"Documents\".  Doing this together will keep the special icon for the folder.  You should then have a new Documents folder, that is actually a link to /mnt/shared/Documents.\nRepeat this for other folders, such as Music, Pictures, etc.\nEdit1 after new information about HFS+\nI haven't ever needed to dual-boot with OSX, so I'm not an expert on the details, although it's not that different except for the filesystem.\nThere's some discussion elsewhere on AskUbuntu; the question was for journalled, but the answers were not, mostly.  \nIt might be worth seeing if you can get it mounted using the mount command first, although what I do is keep the editor open for /etc/fstab, make a change, then run the command mount -a, which not only mounts the entries, but gives an error if there is one, which is helpful. I think this is very useful. Sometimes, you'll need to unmount one or more partitions before running it, but for most, if it gives an error that it's already mounted, it doesn't matter.\nSince it works in Mint, though, and I assume you are using the same methods, have you installed the hfsprogs?  sudo apt-get install hfsprogs\next3\nAlso, using the volume label instead of device name will make it much more clear when editing, and less error-prone in use, in case a drive gets mounted differently.\nMy example fstab entry will, of course, be different than your, especially because of the different filesystems.  Also, the final column is somewhat arbitrary.\nAbout the separate folders for each OS... In case you missed this detail, what I do is to mount just the data, not the entire home directory.  So, for example, on Linux, each distro would have its own home directory, but the data folders would be shared.  So the OS-dependent stuff goes into the same partition as everything else, and the data folders have no OS-dependent data at all.  This is why I don't mount a separate home directory like many people suggest; I can easily reuse my data directories for any version, any OS, with no problems.  \nI read that recent OSX version can read/write to NTFS partitions, by the way, so it's possible to use NTFS and read/write everywhere.\nOne more thing... have you checked the ownership and permissions of /mnt/temp/SnowLeopard/localadmin?  If you're not sure, you can run ls -alF /mnt/temp/SnowLeopard/localadmin, (or ll /mnt...) and post the results.  You should see yourself as the owner of the directories that you are linking to.  You should be able to see the same information by doing ls -L in your home directory; the uppercase 'L' shows the info on the link targets rather than the links.\nLet me know if you need more information, or have questions.  Also, let me know if it solves you problems. :-)\n", "Q: Ubuntu frequently hogging up disk space? A little note before we begin, the machine was constantly active for 5 to 7 days straight, the only reason it was shut off at some point was to turn it back on immediately due to locking or unusable behavior (Not a complete freeze, as the cursor was still moveable, these happened after doing stuff like running a certain game (GTA IV) or running the command \"compiz --replace).\nI have a Ubuntu 14.04 machine, and something has gone fishy with it. First, Skype had a disk i/o error, I moved 40 GB of space to an external drive and rebooted to make it work fine, then today it happens again, I notice that in my home folder it reads that there are 0 bytes worth of free space, so I hit Ctrl+H to view hidden files and folders, and notice that my Cache took up a whopping 746 GB of disk space, I went in the folder and checked everything there too, the folder lxsession had around 740 GB, I opened that up to see a single folder called \"Lubuntu\" (Ubuntu was installed, but I also installed the \"lubuntu-desktop\" package), in that was a run.log with the same space, I deleted that and emptied the trash, and 5 minutes later I'm down to 10kb disk space? I rechecked, the file was gone, I freed up more disk space only for it to become used again, what should I do?\nNote: I have not experienced any \"Out of the blue\" crashes, even after rebooting the problem persists, Also, I moved folders from \"/home/me\" to my external drive, and since that drive is mounted in \"/exhd\", I bind mounted the folders I moved as if they were still on my hard disk, the external drive seems to have no problem and uses the NTFS file system, while my internal drive has my install partition as the problem and uses the EXT4 partition.\n\nA: Not sure if you are deleting large files, but one immediate troubleshoot would be to check your trash. Ubuntu counts the trash against the disk space, i.e. it does not auto-clear but requires you to explicitly empty it before the space taken up by deleted files is made available for use.\n\nA: Apparantly, after a final reboot, the disk space went up to 736.5 GB (The File Manager says GiB, using PCManFM), I might have a bad partition, or need a new hard drive, but I'm getting a shiny new 6TB HDD for Christmas, I should backup everything to transfer there...\n", "Q: I installed League of Legends and I can't open it in Wine I Installed League Of Legends in Wine, but when I click on the shortcut nothing happens.\n\nA: Every Application that can be used in Wine usually has an entry in the WineHQ AppDB.

So, in the buttons not affected by the theme it is impossible to read what is the button. \nIs there a way to fix this issue?\n\nA: Just installed the QT configurations package. Everything works fine now.\n", "Q: How to install Epson WF2010 on Ubuntu 14.0 I am not an expert on Ubuntu but has been using it for the last 3 years.\nI recently bought an Epson printer WF2010. On installing it the printer is recognised by the computer but on printing it prints rubbish!\nOn contacting Epson they sent me the following instructions:\nand the following if using a 64 bit system:\nepson-inkjet-printer-201211w_1.0.0-1lsb3.2_amd64.deb\nAlong with the following file regardless of system type:\nepson-inkjet-printer-201211w-1.0.0-1lsb3.2.x86_64.rpm\nI installed epson-inkjet-printer-201211w_1 through the software centre. But, cannot open it!\nNot sure what to do with the file: epson-inkjet-printer-201211w_1.0.0-1lsb3.2_amd64.deb\nPlease help!!!!\n\nA: The epson-inkjet-printer-201211w-1.0.0-1lsb3.2.x86_64.rpm file is going to be used for rpm-based distributions. If you can't install the .deb file through the Software Center, you can always attempt to install it via the command line using the dpkg package manager. Try running sudo dpkg -i epson-inkjet-printer-201211w_1.0.0-1lsb3.2_amd64.deb in the directory where the file is located.\n\nA: I downloaded the applicable driver from epson 'epson-inkjet-printer-201211w_1.0.0-1lsb3.2_amd64.deb'.\nThen I double clicked on the file and the installation started.\nThen it asked for a mount of the Ubuntu installation disk in '/media/cdrom'.\nI inserted the installation disk but unfortunately  it automounted to '/media/mycomputer/UBUNTU-disk-name'.\nTherefore I opened the terminal and input after the'$ ' prompt:\nsudo mount -B '/media/CCC/Ubuntu 14.04 LTS amd64' '/media/cdrom'\nTo do so, please replace CCC with your computer name and 'Ubuntu 14.04 LTS amd64' with the name of your installation disk,\nAfter this I continued the installation procedure but the installation failed.\nThen I double clicked again the file: 'epson-inkjet-printer-201211w_1.0.0-1lsb3.2_amd64.deb' but with the cdrom already mounted from the attempt before.\nAfter this the installation ran perfectly, so I've also installed a driver to happiness with my printer to myself.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 five continuously beeps I've installed Ubuntu 14.04 LTS when it was released, and a couple of weeks before, my laptop started to beep.

What should I do to fix that?\n\nA: The Real-Time clock failure is indicating that the motherboard of your computer needs to have it's battery replaced - this is a coin-type battery, available generally at supermarkets, drugstores and hardware stores.  The Dell documentation will tell you where on the motherboard to find it, and how to replace it.\n\nA: I have a Dell Inspiron N5110 that starts beeping continuously in sets of 5 immediately after the power button is pressed. I've found no problems with the computer, it boots Ubuntu 16.04, and runs everything as expected. I know that 5 beeps is a sign to replace the CMOS battery but frankly at this point the computer is not worth it. I just wanted the beeping to stop. Fortunately I discovered that if I endure the beeps until the Ubuntu login screen then I can close the lid of the laptop and they stop. I can then open the lid again and login, the beeps never come back until the computer is restarted. \n", "Q: Can't get Diablo 3 to work on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS I've tried launching Diablo 3 through playonlinux and it always crashes after \"Retrieving Hero List\" \nI have the latest version of Wine and I've tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*using the Setarch command\n\n*putting \"-opengl\" in the arguments. \n\n\nAnd it still crashes.

I am formatting my partitions, and I want to know if this is the same as formatting or wiping my hard drive. I messed with my partitions too much, and I heard this will make my computer unstable. Will this fix this? If so, how can I merge my partitions into one once they are done formatting?\nBTW, I have not yet installed Ubuntu on my computer. When I do, will there be an option to format my drive? And will this do the same thing?\n\nA: Wiping generally means to overwrite a partition/drive with other data (nulls, zeros, random) to completely destroy all data and prevent recovery. Formatting is to put a new filesystem on a partition, possibly on top of an old partition leaving the old data still recoverable but normally unseen.\nThe Ubuntu installer should let you pick a partition to format & install to, and probably partitions for /tmp, home, etc...\nI don't know what \"messing\" you did with your drive so I couldn't guess if it's bad or not, but if you do a fresh install of Ubuntu you'll probably want to format it's partition to a ubuntu-friendly filesystem (fat32 or ntfs aren't optimal for linux) it should be as stable as completely wiping your drive, the rest of the drive is just data (as long as there's nothing running before Ubuntu)\nIf you want, you can run a Ubuntu live usb/cd/dvd (the same one you'll use to install Ubuntu) and run gparted (can install it with sudo apt-get install gparted if it's not already there) and resize or delete or move/make new partitions. There isn't really a merge. But backup any data you want to keep first. Actually it's safest to backup data before installing Ubuntu too.\n", "Q: forgot passphrase I installed Ubuntu 14.04 and did a full encryption.

Is there any way arrive this with login password?  Thanks for your time in this silly question. I have not familiarized myself in the ways I should have and my friend took my only written version sneaking thinking I was going to leave it there while adventuring. \n\nA: If you used ecryptfs for encryption (which I think is the standard encryption Ubuntu offers on install) then your password was used to wrap (encrypt) the actual disk encryption key. \nIt's pretty easy to change your user password (using a live usb/cd) and log in again if it's only your home that was encrypted, but recovering the encrypted data will require your old user password. \nIf there's a written version of your password somewhere, getting that would be the easiest solution. Otherwise you'll have to guess or remember what the old password was to have a hope of unencrypting the data this century.\n", "Q: Not able to include sqlite3 in c program I installed libsqlite3-dev from ubuntu software center and after the installation, i found the sqlite3.h file in usr/include folder.

How do I change from 1 to 4 sheets in Writer and do this? Don't bother spell checking your answer, I need this very urgently!\n\nA: I don't think LibreOffice Writer would be the best tool for splitting & playing with an image, why not try Gimp, cut & paste quarters into 4 new images to print?\n\nAs to how to do that in Gimp, I've never tried it so this is just a guess... but it should tell you how many pixels wide & long the image is, so take those measurements and divide by each \"side\" of however many pages you'd like to print on, then split the image at about that length to get equal sized chunks. Like 4 pages would have 2 on top & 2 on bottom (2 x 2), so 2 per side, so divide length & width by 2. 9 pages would be 3 x 3, etc...\nMaybe an invisible/non-printing layer with the split grid lines would help to copy the right sections? -- Actually GIMP already has similar features built-in, Guides and Grid (in view menu, settings in image menu), can set spacing and show lines over your image/workspace, not part of the image.\nThere should be lots of good how-to guides on everything GIMP-related somewhere on the web, try a web search and pick one that you're comfortable with that looks like it does what you want.\nActually, I'm sure there are printing companies with large-format printers that could print on very large sheets of paper (or even posters or plastic/cloth), it would be easier but more expensive to call them and get a big sheet printed there?\n", "Q: How do I clear or remove unused files, as in hard drive directorys Is there a utility to defrag and clean hd's or recover crashed data.

If so would this be operating system specific, or an option in grub, or something else?\n\nA: TL;DR: You can when hibernated, you can't when suspended.\nWhen you are suspended, the memory of the current OS is still stored in RAM. You can't just wake up into another operating system from being suspended, because only one operating system can occupy the process and ram at a time. Having two operating systems with the same RAM won't work.\nWhen hibernating, it's a bit different. Ubuntu will store the memory into the \"swap\" space you have set up, and completely shut down the computer. This means that when you restart your computer, you can choose to boot into Windows instead of Ubuntu.\nNote that if you have two Linux distributions using the same swap partition, you won't be able to hibernate in one and boot into the other - they will both try to use the swap partition, resulting in the same problem when suspending. The reason windows can start when Ubuntu is hibernating is because Windows has a separate hibernation file on it's own partition.\n", "Q: Live CD with Casper partition problem I'm using Ubuntu Live CD on version 14.10.

Trying a newer kernel (newer Ubuntu live cd/dvd/iso probably the easiest) might help, does the latest live (currently 14.10?) do the same thing?\nAnd it would be hard for me to tell if my laptop battery were really not charging when running Ubuntu, or if it's only the battery % indicator that wasn't getting updated. I'd try timing experiments, something like charging the laptop fully while off (5hrs? 8hrs? however long it usually takes), then use the laptop unplugged for 2 hours (or however long is about half run time), then plug in and keep using for 2 more hours, then unplug and see how long it lasts. Once running Ubuntu and once running windows. If it lasts just as long in Ubuntu and windows then it looks like just the battery % not getting updated, but if it lasts for 2 or 3 more hours in Windows and turns off in 20 minutes for Ubuntu, that's the battery.\nAnd does the BIOS show anything about the battery's charge? If it does, that'd be a great way to check the \"actual\" charge, before running & after running/charging for a while.\nWhen a kernel default got changed a while ago my sensors were no longer visible without booting with the option acpi_enforce_resources=lax (added before the \"--\" from the live iso's F6/aditional options). Does that show anything different? (FYI sensors from lm-sensors is informative)\nAlso, running upower may give some more power info too, in case it's the desktop power indicator that's not updating. A command like upower --monitor-detail should \"print the full details of the power source whenever an event happens.\"\nI would assume that charging the battery would be controlled by the BIOS or hardware or something, it seems too important and hardware-specific to let any OS control that...\n\nA: It is possible that something is eating power - does the laptop run hot? You could try top to see what processes are running, or powertop will report on actual power usage - and let you tune it down, more importantly.\nIf it isn't actually going flat then there is some power coming into the system so you know the hardware's OK, and it charges when off so the charge circuits are good. BTW I don't think it's BIOS so much as hardware that does charging - it's all voltage/current controlled, if you left it to firmware or OS you'd get fires!\n", "Q: removing and updating eclipse I have downloaded eclipse Kepler but when I try to remove eclipse luna from opt by using command \nrm eclipse it gives me this message\nrm:can't remove \"eclipse\":is a directory\nwhat i'm trying to di is remove eclipse luna to install eclipse kepler\n\nA: Assuming you have installed it manually and not using apt\nyou have to use -r option with rm,\nuse rm -r /opt/eclipse/\nBut you have installed it using apt then use:\nsudo apt-get autoremove eclipse\nrm -r ~/.eclipse/\n\n\nA: I had the same problem once, and pressing the super key, then typing 'eclipse' and right clicking it gave me an option to delete it.\n", "Q: ipython vs ~/.local/bin/ipython I believe that since I installed IPython Notebook via pip --user I now have two instances of each of Python, IPython and the other Python modules: the original instances that came with my Ubuntu system and the new local instances installed by pip.\n$ which ipython\n/usr/bin/ipython\n\n$ cat /usr/bin/ipython\nfrom IPython import start_ipython    \nstart_ipython()\n\nAre the two ways of calling ipython (ipython and ~/.local/bin/ipython) equivalent?\n\nA: No, IPythons is not a python version but a couple of utilities for Python. Mainly a improved command shell and the notebook. But you are using your regular python install.\nYou can install Ipython with it's own contained python version but this is not what pip does per default.\nPip can install packages locally if you give it the -user switch, if you did it, then you still have only one python installation, but with different libraries for different users.\nFinally if you calling it with ~/.local/bin/ipython will probably run the user-level version of ipython instead of the system-level one (if you have both installed). If it runs that same thing or a different one than typing 'ipython' depends on your path.\n\nA: \nAre the two ways of calling ipython (ipython and ~/.local/bin/ipython) equivalent?\n\nShort answer: no, they are not equivalent. Now lets see why: \nPip can install packages under a user's own home directory if you use it with the --user option, like you did. When you do this, it installs the package to ~/.local (note that this relative path gets expanded to something like /home/username/.local), however you still have only one global Python interpreter at /usr/bin/python. This makes the different libraries or modules that you install this way to only be accessible locally, which means that they aren't shared among users. \nIf you call any program with a relative or absolute path it will run whichever executable is located at the end of that path if it exists. In this case, the relative path ~/.local/bin/ipython points to a local instance of IPython.\nWhen you call an executable by just typing its name, like ipython the PATH environment variable is used to determine what to run. So what actually runs will depend on its precedence in your PATH. This may or may not be the same executable as the one located at ~/.local/bin/ipython.\nUse the which command to check what executable will be launched if you only type the name of a command: which ipython. It will give you the path to it.\n\nAdditionally, if you are already installing packages locally rather than system wide, I'd suggest you use virtual environments, it will make your life easier (most of the time), give virtualenv or venv a try.\n", "Q: Change Unity Default Dash Shortcuts I'm on Ubuntu 14.04 running Unity Desktop and I'd like to change the default shortcuts of the Unity Dash (Super+a for Application, Super+c for Photos, Super+v for Videos, etc.) but can't find the options anywhere.\nI already looked in Unity-Tweak-Tool and CompizConfig-Settings-Manager.\nCan they be changed?\nI really just use the Dash with tapping the Super key and I'd like to assign the other shortcuts to other applications.\nThere is also a problem with the Super+t shortcut. It opens the trash, though I reassigned it to the terminal in the keyboard settings. \nAlso the 'Show Desktop' shortcut is set to Ctrl+Alt+d but still lives on Super+D (They work both at the moment ... )\nSeems like it's hardcoded, or am I wrong?\n\nA: Parcial answer: to change some of the shortcuts you mention (Super + a, c, v,...) you need to edit the proper file ending with .scope that you'll find in /usr/share/unity/scopes (you need to be superuser in order to edit these files).\nFor example, if you want to reassign the shortcut super + a with the compiz manager you first need to find the file: /usr/share/unity/scopes/applications.scope and change the line: \"Shortcut=a\" by a letter you won't use (\"Shortcut=n\" for instance).\nHope it helps.\n\nA: Not quite an answer here, but more then a comment. \nIf this is currently possible, I'm guessing it would involve editing the appropriate .desktop files, but I can't find such a file for Trash or Desktop, which makes me think the letters for those are hard-coded in to Unity. \nOf course you can assign shortcuts under Keyboard settings, but that doesn't work quite the same way.  \n", "Q: How to duplicate all apps on 1 laptop and install on another?

Is it used to encrypt just the master key, or does it encrypt contents too? If it only encrypts the master key, how is contents encrypted?\nI'm sure aes also very secure. But I think that public key encryption is more secure than other methods such as aes. Thus, I tried to find out how to use gpg or any other encryption methods for luks at the man page of cryptsetup, but I could not find a solution.\nHow can I use public-key encryption for luksFormat?\n\nA: Public key encryption is really only useful if you want to have other people encrypt messages to you, and you don't want to go to the trouble of secretly giving them your secret encryption key. So you post your public key for the world to see and encrypt messages to you, that only you can read.\nIt would be of no benefit to you personally encrypting your files on your own computer. It could be assumed that public key encryption is less secure than conventional encryption (like AES, Blowfish, Camellia...) since you're handing out part of the encryption information (the public part). Though in practice they are both effectively \"unbreakable\" in any human lifetime.\nAnd you may not know how the public-key encryption program PGP/GPG actually works, it conventionally encrypts messages, and then encrypts the conventional key using public key encryption. \nHere's a quote from some older (but still valid) PGPi documentation explaining it, and a bit about why someone may think one method is more secure than the other, if they're only comparing key sizes:\n\n\nPGP combines some of the best features of both conventional and public key cryptography. PGP is a hybrid cryptosystem. When a user encrypts plaintext with PGP, PGP first compresses the plaintext. Data compression saves modem transmission time and disk space and, more importantly, strengthens cryptographic security. Most cryptanalysis techniques exploit patterns found in the plaintext to crack the cipher. Compression reduces these patterns in the plaintext, thereby greatly enhancing resistance to cryptanalysis. (Files that are too short to compress or which don't compress well aren't compressed.)\nPGP then creates a session key, which is a one-time-only secret key. This key is a random number generated from the random movements of your mouse and the keystrokes you type. This session key works with a very secure, fast conventional encryption algorithm to encrypt the plaintext; the result is ciphertext. Once the data is encrypted, the session key is then encrypted to the recipient's public key. This public key-encrypted session key is transmitted along with the ciphertext to the recipient. \n...\nThe combination of the two encryption methods combines the convenience of public key encryption with the speed of conventional encryption. Conventional encryption is about 1,000 times faster than public key encryption. Public key encryption in turn provides a solution to key distribution and data transmission issues. Used together, performance and key distribution are improved without any sacrifice in security. \n...\nHowever, public key size and conventional cryptography's secret key size are totally unrelated. A conventional 80-bit key has the equivalent strength of a 1024-bit public key. A conventional 128-bit key is equivalent to a 3000-bit public key. Again, the bigger the key, the more secure, but the algorithms used for each type of cryptography are very different and thus comparison is like that of apples to oranges. \n\n\n\nIf you wanted to use some method involving GPG to use your public key to encrypt the passphrase or keyfile to your LUKS container, you could do that if you wanted. But then if your GPG private key were ever compromised or lost, so too would your LUKS container. \nAnd you can choose a different cipher with cryptsetup, it would use the cipher to encrypt all the data. See man cryptsetup for info like:\n   --cipher, -c <cipher-spec>\n          Set the cipher specification string.\n\nAnd under a default Ubuntu at least these ciphers should be supported:\nloop-AES: aes, Key 256 bits\nplain: aes-cbc-essiv:sha256, Key: 256 bits\nLUKS1: aes-xts-plain64, Key: 256 bits\n", "Q: After updating 12.04 at the next boot I get a black screen with blinking cursor I just updated my Ubuntu 12.04.

This way, your /srv filesystem will be mounted at a later moment, but before it is needed by MySQL.\n\nA: On a newer Ubuntu with systemd as Init-system you can set the following options to your shared folder in fstab:\nnoauto,x-systemd.automount,rw\n\n\"noauto\" will skip this filesystem on boot, \"x-systemd.automount\" will mount this filesystem as soon as it is accessed for the first time (a simple ls is sufficient). This way the boot process gets not interrupted, but on shutdown it will be cleanly dismounted (which is not the case if you do it the rc.local-way).\n", "Q: Adobe Acrobat Reader version 10/11 & Ubuntu 14.04 I'm using Ubuntu 14.04 desktop.

[Y/n] \n\nIt want to remove important packages such as libboost-*, nvidia-331* and others. Why this is happening?\n\nA: The package libc6-dev is required to compile anything, and so most, if not all, development packages depend on that package. If you remove libc6-dev, then those headers will get removed as well (along with some of the libraries themselves, if nothing else depends on those libraries and were automatically installed).\nRemoving and reinstalling this package probably won't help you in compiling 32-bit programs from a 64-bit Ubuntu, since this package is for compiling 64-bit programs. Instead, make sure that libc6-dev-i386 is installed. If you are still getting an error, create a new question and post the error message there.\n\nA: After searching for some minutes, I found this answer inside Stack Overflow site.\nSo the solution for my problem is, just use install --reinstall [package-name] argument when running apt-get, it will just reinstall you desired package without purging and downloading it back, so here is full command that solved my problem :\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall libc6-dev-i386\n", "Q: What is the latest, tested, Ubuntu version which works on a MacBook 1,1 (early 2006) Which version of Lubuntu can I install on a MacBook 1,1 (early 2006, Intel Dual Core with 2 GB of RAM)? Or should I go for an earlier Ubuntu, or Kubuntu? I would prefer an older version than the latest one if this brings stability and speed.\nThanks,\nVal\n\nA: My laptop's specs are similar to yours but I have more RAM. I have no problems with lubuntu 14.04\nEven when I first got my computer 5 years ago I found the kubuntu at the time was a bit slow on it. I don't think that's an option. KDE (kubuntu) and Unity (ubuntu default) are designed to be fancy and beautiful, not lightweight. \nUbuntu with gnome or Xubuntu would be other options, but personally I like lubuntu best, and it's the lightest. \nIf you want something even lighter than lubuntu there is puppy linux http://puppylinux.org/wikka/tahrpup\nI don't think it's necessary to go that light. \n", "Q: openstack-install

You can create profiles and such like to sync locally between USBs and remotely via SSH.\nThe best thing is the GUI, it is easy to use because you can see exactly what you want - no messing around with the command line with rsync.\nIf you want it auto, you do need to use the command line - cron. Have a look here for how to use it and below is an example:\n30 17 * * * unison PROFILENAME\n\nThat will run at 5:30pm every day. Make sure the profile that you create is 1 word only, and that you remember it.\n\nA: You can do it easily with rsync (for synchronizing) and cron (for scheduling regular calls of rsync). \nTo just synchronize:\n rsync -rtvu --delete source_folder/ destination_folder/ \n\nTo schedule cron:\nsudo crontab -e\n\n# For example, you can run a sync\n# at 5 a.m every week with:\n0 5 * * 1 rsync -rtvu --delete source_folder/ destination_folder/ \n\nThese commands are really fundamental and usual in Linux; you can learn much more about them by searching the web.\nEdit: sorry, rsync command works one way only.\n\nA: maybe for beginners conduit would be interesting and very easy to handle with it's GUI...\nbut it isn't developed anymore (like Unison)!\n", "Q: Just installed Ubuntu 14.04. Internet connection goes amazingly fast, then goes very slow My wireless internet connection goes extremely fast which I love, but then it slows down a lot. I just installed Ubuntu, and aside from the slow-down I love everything about it. Just I am having a hard time finding a fix to this problem. My laptop is an HP by the way.\nThanks for reading and for the help.\n\nA: I recently installed Ubuntu as well and faced the same problem.

Ubuntu 14.04 comes with python3.4 by default. I would like to know if there is a possibility to make my program uses python2.7 instead of the default version. I thought about uninstalling python3.4, but I think it is not a good idea as some other programs may depends on it. \nThanks  \n\nA: Check your ~/.bashrc and/or .bash_aliases to find if you have any kind of alias like this:\nalias python=python3\nChange it accordingly to python2.7\n\nA: Normally, in Ubuntu, python defaults to python2. So you probably have a \n#!/usr/bin/env python3 \n# \n\nor similar in the top of your script. Either if this is the case or if you have changed the defaults, in the header of your program, change \n#!/usr/bin/env python\n# \n\n(or the more probable python3) to \n#!/usr/bin/env python2\n# \n\nIn standard Ubuntu, python should automatically point to python2: \n[romano:~/tmp] % ls -l /usr/bin/python\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 9 jul 22 09:49 /usr/bin/python -> python2.7\n\nso normally the above thing should not be needed. But python2 and python3 points respectively to the standard version of version 2 and 3, so if you explicitly want one version, simply tell it.\n", "Q: Ubuntu boot problem at start black screen white cursor I recently swapped hard drives on my HP computer and when I swapped back to my Ubuntu one I get just a blinking cursor on boot.\n\nA: Have you tried using the Boot-Repair tool? It is one of the suggested tools for boot repair on Ubuntu's Help pages. \nAssuming you can/know how to change your BIOS settings to boot from a USB flash drive, you could use your Windows HDD to download it and make a bootable USB stick to try and repair GRUB with your Ubuntu HDD.\nYou would need to download a utility like UNetbootin and the Boot-Repair tool on your Windows OS, then once made you simply swap your Ubuntu HDD back into your machine and boot from your USB stick.\n1. On your Windows OS, obtain UNetbootin from here. The UNetbootin tool is a simple .exe file that you can simply run; no permanent install is necessary.\n2.  Download the Boot-Repair tool from here. It will be in the form of an .ISO file that UNetbootin can read to create your bootable USB flash drive.\n3.  Insert the USB flash drive you want to use into your computer.\n4.  Run the UNetbootin tool you have already downloaded to install the Boot-Repair tool on the USB flash drive.\n5.  In UNetbootin, you will have to select the Ubuntu distribution and version in the provided drop-down menus. Make sure you choose the appropriate version of Ubuntu that you have on your HDD (either 14.04_Live or 12.04_Live...I'm assuming at this point you have one of those, since you didn't specify which version of Ubuntu you have installed)\n6.  Select the \"Diskimage\" radio button near the bottom, make sure \"ISO\" is selected in the dropdown box, then browse/select the Boot-Repair ISO file you downloaded.\n7.  Make sure \"USB Drive\" is selected in the \"Type\" dropdown box, and assign any drive letter you wish (if you don't want the default drive letter it selects).\n8.  Click OK, then give the UNetbootin tool a few minutes to create the USB drive.\n9.  Power down your computer, and swap your Windows HDD for your Ubuntu HDD.\n10. Power back on; if you have not already configured your BIOS to boot from USB, now is the time to do so.\n11. Once your computer boots to the USB drive, use the Boot-Repair tool to repair GRUB. If you are not an advanced user, I would recommend using the default \"Recommended Repair\" option since you are not dual-booting another OS on that HDD.\nOther detailed instructions can be found at these locations:\nhttps: //help.ubuntu.com/community/Boot-Repair\nhttp: //sourceforge.net/projects/boot-repair/\nI apologize that the above two links have the extra space; I can only post two links in total per post in these forums.\nHope this helps; make sure you let us know if this works, or if you need any more help. If you need more help, please make sure you are as detailed as you can be (computer type, Ubuntu version, any errors you may be getting, etc etc). The more detail we have, the better we can be of help.\nAlternately, you could use the Recovery Mode that is already installed with Ubuntu if you can access it.\nWhen you power on your computer, hold the Shift key as soon as your BIOS screen finishes loading, or has almost finished loading. You should get some boot options, one of which will be Choose Advanced Options for Ubuntu.\nThe next screen, you should choose the first recovery option, which should look something like this:\nUbuntu, with Linux 3.13.0-39-generic (recovery mode)\nThe third menu will provide several options, but in your case I believe the dpkg option, which attempts to restore broken packages, may be of help in restoring your Ubuntu system. Again, let us know if this helps or if you need further assistance.\n", "Q: Can I create bookmark folders in Nautilus? Is it possible to create \"bookmark folders\" in the Nautilus sidebar, like in Firefox?\nMy specific case is that I have ~5 different folders for University Lectures and ~4 different projects from work, plus maybe some private bookmarks for the series I'm watching at the moment, etc. My left bar is quite filled with bookmarks, so in my opinion the advantage of bookmarks (no long time spent searching) diminishes.\nIs there a way?\n\nA: No, there is not. You can however, place all related folders inside a single folder, and then only bookmark the top folder for those, to reduce the amount of folders you have, and get similar results.\n", "Q: Install Teamspeak Client on Ubuntu Server Today I tried to setting up a Teamspeak client for my Ubuntu Server (14.10).

I have tried Unetbootin, but the installation halts at step 2 file 254. I have verified the md5 is correct.\nI also tried:\nsudo dd if=/Volumes/BETHY/ubuntu-14.10-desktop-amd64.iso of= /dev/disk1s1 bs=1m\n\nI have used multiple thumb drives. any idea?\nEDIT : managed to create a usb boot disc (i think), it does not work. is there any way to verify the usb created ?\n\nA: I used unetbootin to create an Ubuntu 14.04 installation on a USB stick but had to go through some hoops to make it work. First is that the USB drive must be formatted as a vfat filesystem. That filesystem should be on the first partition, better if it's the only partition. Then mount the USB stick somewhere (change the device so that it is the drive letter of your USB stick (mine was /dev/sdb1), and change the mount point to one that works for your system):\n$ mount -t vfat /dev/sdb1 /mnt/usb\n\nI do not use OS X, so you will need to sort out how to access the command line and gain root privileges. Next call unetbootin from the command line giving it the following arguments:\n$ unetbootin installtype=USB targetdrive=/dev/sdb1  (or your target drive letter).\n\nThat should start the unetbootin GUI and allow you to chose your installation file and write it to the USB stick.\n", "Q: Persistent live USB Ubuntu 14 not working Used Fedora Live USB creator 3.12 to create a live USB of Ubuntu 14 (latest 64 bit build)\nI can successfully boot the USB on my Surface Pro 3 but I cannot get the persistence to work.\nIt is not an option in the Grub menu either.

I was just wondering if it's possible to install a version of Hyper-V?\njust looking to play around with Hyper-V \ni.e. Is there a sudo apt-get install command I can use?\nif not .. no biggie\n\nA: No, you cannot install the Hyper-V management software on Linux. It is a Windows virtualization system from Microsoft. The kernel already has drivers to run as a guest OS under Windows though. You can install the virtualbox-qt package though, if you want an easy app for creating virtual machines on Ubuntu.\n\nA: You cannot install Hyper-V on Ubuntu since it is exclusively for Windows machines.\n\nHyper-V, codenamed Viridian and formerly known as Windows Server\n  Virtualization, is a native hypervisor; it can create virtual machines\n  on x86-64 systems.

When booting from a live USB, I will see the splash screen of whatever Distro I have loaded, then it flashes the desktop for a second, then goes blank. After a minute of blank screen a mouse cursor appears, and nothing after that.\nI have made a 16GB live USB in FAT32 using the programs Rufus, Lili Live USB installer, and UnetBootin. All produce the same results. I have tested Ubuntu 12, 14, 64bit flavors. I have also tried Debian and Linux mint 17 Cinnamon.\nOne interesting thing to note is that Linux Mint 17 32-bit was able to display the desktop in compatibility mode. In this mode the USB booted to the desktop instead of the installer, despite me choosing the install option in UnetBootin. When I run the installer from here, it gets to formatting \"swap\" and then crashes, leaving me with a cursor on the screen again.

Thank you in advance for your time!\n\nA: The easiest way is to remove your Radeon 6800 Graphics Card until after installation. After installation, remount the card and configure the driver. It is simple as that...\nTo configure your driver follow this guide\nSlightly harder but recommended way:\nAs the system CD boots, on the advanced welcome page (press any key immediately when it starts booting)\nTo supplement the main boot options, the F1-F6 keys provide additional information and boot options for special circumstances. These options are accessed by pressing any key before the Welcome screen appears. Pressing the ESC key or selecting a language will display the main screen.\nThese options are not normally needed, but in some special cases they come in handy. Any changes made will affect the current boot only.\nPress F4 for Modes. Use this option when a specific driver must be loaded to allow installation or booting to the LiveCD Desktop. Once Ubuntu is installed or booted, the user can permanently install the required drivers.\n\nUse the safe graphics mode. Then everything will run normally.

An app such as gparted will see drives and partitions, which can be mounted to the existing filesystem somewhere of your choosing.\nPartitions, or more precisely, filesystems (which may be the entire drive) can be explicitly mounted to any directory of your choosing that you have permissions to use; to do this, you use the mount command, normally using sudo, since only root can mount filesystems normally.  They can also be mounted automatically by opening it in Nautilus.\nThe best way to permanently use a disk is to include mounting instructions in the file /etc/fstab.  That is where all the other mounts are, including the root filesystem, the swapdrive, etc.  There is a lot of discussions on how to do this for various situations, and you should search and read some, then perhaps ask questions about specific problems rather than asking for it to be reposted here again.  \nThe end result will look like one big disk, and can be set up in any way you want.  Try experimenting first with the mount command to get it set up, then move on to /etc/fstab to avoid mounting it every time you reboot.\n", "Q: Cannot boot Windows 7 after install Ubuntu 14.04 Of course, I know my question is very similar, but I tried some ways and it didn't work.\nHere is my problem: I tried to install Ubuntu 14.04 on Windows 7 Ultimate. \nWhen at choosing partition for Ubuntu, I create 3 partitions for EFI(100MB), Ubuntu(65GB) and Swap(7GB).

Or do I need to have three partitions and some \"unallocated space\" to get the OP working?\nThank you in advance!\nGreetings,\nNils\n\nA: Over provisioning simply means never writing to some part of the drive.  It doesn't matter if part of the drive is in a partition you never use, or not assigned to any partition at all -- either way, you never write there.\nOn the other hand, occasionally running fstrim is better than over provisioning the drive.\n\nA: I think you're OK, the 15G will be used as needed.  The new disks recommend 10% (12G) but the older ones recommended 20% , so you are in the middle.  The partitioning should not make any difference.\n\nA: If you use fstrim with full-disk encryption (i.e.: LUKS) then your entire hard drive will be filled from the start (with noise) and fstrim won't help at all.\nOver-provisioning should not be discounted when doing full-disk encryption.

System Load Indicator displays plots of CPU activity, memory use, hard drive i/o, etc. There's also a \"Load\" graph, but I don't know what it means. What exactly is this \"Load\"?\n\nA: Short summary from two different sources.\nFrom en.wikipedia.org/\n\nThe load average represents the average system load over a period of\n  time. It conventionally appears in the form of three numbers which\n  represent the system load during the last one-, five-, and\n  fifteen-minute periods.\n[...]\nAn idle computer has a load number of 0. Each process using or waiting \n  for CPU (the ready queue or run queue) increments the load number by\n  1. Most UNIX systems count only processes in the running (on CPU) or runnable (waiting for CPU) states. However, Linux also includes\n  processes in uninterruptible sleep states (usually waiting for disk\n  activity), which can lead to markedly different results if many\n  processes remain blocked in I/O due to a busy or stalled I/O\n  system.[1] This, for example, includes processes blocking due to an\n  NFS server failure or to slow media (e.g., USB 1.x storage devices).\n  Such circumstances can result in an elevated load average, which does\n  not reflect an actual increase in CPU use (but still gives an idea on\n  how long users have to wait).\n[...]\nFor single-CPU systems that are CPU bound, one can think of load\n  average as a percentage of system utilization during the respective\n  time period. For systems with multiple CPUs, one must divide the\n  number by the number of processors in order to get a comparable\n  percentage.\n\nFrom man uptime\n\nSystem load averages is the average number of processes that are\n  either in a runnable or uninterruptable state. A process in a runnable\n  state is either using the CPU or waiting to use the CPU. A process in\n  uninterruptable state is waiting for some I/O access, eg waiting for\n  disk. The averages are taken over the three time intervals. Load\n  averages are not normalized for the number of CPUs in a system, so a\n  load average of 1 means a single CPU system is loaded all the time\n  while on a 4 CPU system it means it was idle 75% of the time.\n\nTo answer the original question, it is the load average for the past 1 minute.\n\nA: This means system load, check these resources:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Load_(computing)\n\n*https://serverfault.com/questions/67759/how-to-understand-the-memory-usage-and-load-average-in-linux-server\n\n*https://superuser.com/questions/23498/what-does-load-average-mean-in-unix-linux\n\n*https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/33203/how-does-load-average-work-with-modern-cpus\n\n*http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/9001\n", "Q: Firefox 34 - Black screen playing Adobe flash videos After upgrading to Firefox 34, Flash videos stopped working.

In that directory another text file will be created with the directory creation time. Now I have set the directory creation path as adhikarisubir@ubuntu:~/test/basic_unix. when I am manually invoking the script the directories are getting created in the aforementioned directory but when I am running from the crontab it is getting created in adhikarisubir@ubuntu:~. Following is my script:\n #THIS CODE WILL CREATE A DIRECTORY WITH TIME OF CREATION AS PART OF DIRECTORY NAME\n echo \"The time is $(date +%H_%M_%S)\"\n now=$(date +%H_%M_%S)\n echo $now\n echo $(pwd) \n createdep=nowt_$now\n echo \"$createdep\"\n mkdir \"$createdep\"\n cd nowt_$now\n echo \"Current directory is $(pwd)\"\n echo \"This is a text file which will contain the createtime\" > Newtxt.txt\n sed -i \"s/createtime/$(date '+%H:%M:%S')/g\" Newtxt.txt\n\nMy crontab command is:\n*/2 * * * * sh test/basic_unix/createfiles.sh\n\n\nA: When you are in the directory ~/test/basic_unix and invoke your script, your mkdir \"$createdep\" command creates that folder in ~/test/basic_unix because that's the current directory, that's where you ran the script from. However, when you run that script from cron, the directory you start with is your home directory, ~, so your mkdir command creates the folder there.\nYour confusion might be because you think that since your script is under ~/test/basic_unix/createfiles.sh, then the folders will always be created there, but that's incorrect. It's not about where the script is located, it's about where you run the script from. To give you an example, make a directory ~/testing2, then cd ~/testing2, then call your script using sh ~/test/basic_unix_createfiles.sh. You'll find that your folders are being created under ~/testing2, not ~/test/basic_unix. Why? Because that's where you ran the script from, and since your mkdir command is using a relative path, i.e. since your mkdir command is like this: mkdir foldername, it creates it in working directory.\nTo fix your problem, the easiest way is to cd to where you want to create the folders at the very beginning, so your script would look like this:\n#THIS CODE WILL CREATE A DIRECTORY WITH TIME OF CREATION AS PART OF DIRECTORY NAME\n cd /home/adhikarisubir/test/basic_unix #this is the new line added, the rest is the same\n echo \"The time is $(date +%H_%M_%S)\"\n now=$(date +%H_%M_%S)\n echo $now\n echo $(pwd) \n createdep=nowt_$now\n echo \"$createdep\"\n mkdir \"$createdep\"\n cd nowt_$now\n echo \"Current directory is $(pwd)\"\n echo \"This is a text file which will contain the createtime\" > Newtxt.txt\n sed -i \"s/createtime/$(date '+%H:%M:%S')/g\" Newtxt.txt\n\nAnother way to fix your problem is to change your mkdir command to use an absolute path. So your script would look like this:\n#THIS CODE WILL CREATE A DIRECTORY WITH TIME OF CREATION AS PART OF DIRECTORY NAME\n echo \"The time is $(date +%H_%M_%S)\"\n now=$(date +%H_%M_%S)\n echo $now\n echo $(pwd) \n #createdep=nowt_$now\n createdep=/home/adhikarisubir/test/basic_unix/nowt_$now  #createdep is now an absolute path\n echo \"$createdep\"\n mkdir \"$createdep\"\n #cd nowt_$now\n cd $createdep #this cd command now cds to $createdep\n echo \"Current directory is $(pwd)\"\n echo \"This is a text file which will contain the createtime\" > Newtxt.txt\n sed -i \"s/createtime/$(date '+%H:%M:%S')/g\" Newtxt.txt\n\nIt's better to always use absolute paths, so always use /home/adhikarisubir/test/basic_unix instead of saying test/basic_unix.\nNote: I'm assuming your home directory is /home/adhikarisubir.\n", "Q: How could I configure and properly create a WiFi hotspot in a big corporate lan?

SSH isn't even running on that port..\nCan anyone advise me?\n\nA: Ok, with help, I solved my own problem.\nFirst off, for reasons unknown to me, trying to ssh into a server on the same network as the client causes the \"reset by peer\" issue. Which is why using a proxy, or using the server's local IP (192.168.1.4) resolves the issue.\nSecondly, to solve the issue of someone trying to guess my password which I seem to see evidence of in my logs, I changed to public/private key authentication, gave only myself ssh access, and reduced git to the git-shell for security. I also upgraded my iptables rules to start dropping connections to SSH after a certain number of attempts in a time period.\nSo this issue is resolved. Thanks all.\n\nA: You are unlikely to have firewall issues. \"Connection Reset\" means that the connection has been established but then the server didn't like either its configuration or the client.\nTo verify whether this is the case call ssh -v user@server. If you see debug1: Connection established. then your firewall rules are just fine and you should focus on your ssh daemon instead.\nCheck your sshd log (most likely file /var/log/auth.log) for clues about what is going on. If there is nothing obvious and if you can edit file /etc/ssh/sshd_config set LogLevel to either VERBOSE or DEBUG, restart sshd and try again.\n", "Q: Can I use iptables to forward vm guest requests to host This is a bit complicated, but I have a Windows 7 vm (virtualbox) and I need create a persistent connection to the MySQL instance on my host machine.  \nBinding...\nI can do this using mysql address binding in the host my.cnf and corresponding mapping on the vm, but every time I change networks (work, home, wireless, or wired) the IP address of my host machine changes and I have to reset the bind address on the host machine and everywhere else (I have sites on my host machine as well as the VM). \nThe Windows VM has a NAT adapter (as well as a bridged).

However, you may want to use iptables to block access from the internet. \nNetwork traffic on the lo device should not be routed to another device, even a virtual device.  It is likely that virtualbox has created a br0 devices or some device with br in the name.  The IP address of this device would be your best choice to connect to mysql on. \nThe virtual server should be able to connect directly to the mysql server, if it is listening on a reachable address.  It is common for mysql to be configured to listen on the loopback (127.0.0.1) address as a security measure.  Use the command sudo netstat -antp | grep mysql to determine which IP addresses mysql is listening on.  If it is only listening on 127.0.0.1 or ::1, you will need to adjust the mysql configuration. If it is listening on 0.0.0.0, mysql will be reachable on any public address of your server. \n\nA: For security reasons Mysql default does not allow remote access by root. \nTo allow access follow these steps:\nEdit the configuration file \"/etc/mysql/my.cnf\" and remove the restriction of remote access\nComment the following line:\n#bind-address = 127.0.0.1\n\nGive permission to root for connections from any IP:\nmysql -u root -pROOTPASSWORD\nmysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'root'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'ROOTPASSWORD' WITH GRANT OPTION;\nmysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;\nmysql> exit\n\nMysql open port with Iptables:\n/sbin/iptables -A INPUT -i eth0 -p tcp --destination-port 3306 -j ACCEPT\n\nAfter restarting the service, it is possible to connect to the root user from the virtual machine\nSources:\nhttps://www.virtualbox.org/\nhttp://www.ubuntu.com/download/server\nhttp://directory.apache.org/\nhttp://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/\n\n", "Q: How can I start VirtualBox in the face of a DKMS error?

If I look at the Network tab in Chrome Developer Tools, I can see that some of the requests (~50%?) are making the round trip in a fraction of a second, as expected. Others, however, will just hang open for a minute+. I've found the best bet is to refresh without cache (not sure if the cache actually has an effect) and hope the next series of requests works out better.\nI can usually get \"simple\" sites with just a few assets to work after a try or two. But more complex with lots of assets and AJAX (such as Facebook) will really just be unusable. Some parts of the page won't load, and the \"infinite scroll\" certainly doesn't work when I reach the bottom of the ~dozen posts originally loaded.\nThe box is running 14.04, 64 bit, 16GB RAM. The only unusual quirk is that I am driving 3 monitors, including a 30\".\nWhat I've Checked\n\n\n*\n\n*My ISP says the connection looks good from their end. On speedtest sites I get 20+Mb down, 2+ up.\n\n*I have a Mac that doesn't experience any of these problems on the same network. So I think the problem is specific to the Ubuntu box.\n\n*The PC is wired in to the router, 0% packet loss, <1ms ping to router.\n\n*DNS was originally set to be served from localhost and was taking multiple seconds to resolve. I've fixed that problem, however, and DNS now takes a few ms, as expected.\n\n*0% packet loss when pinging Google or Facebook, ~25ms round-trip on requests.\n\n*CPU activity does increase when loading a page, but none of the cores are pegged at 100%.\n\n*The kicker - When I use a Windows VM inside of this Ubuntu machine, I see none of these problems. Implying to me that this is not a fundamental issue with the network/NIC on the host (Ubuntu) machine. I do ocassionaly notice network hiccups in other applications, but it's not this kind of consistently degraded performance, more like a connection will drop while doing a huge apt-get upgrade or something.\n\n\nPlease let me know what information/configuration files I can provide that might be of use!\nThanks.\nEdit: Here's a screenshot of the network traffic.

I enabled desktop sharing and tried RealVNC viewer (on Windows) to connect to it. However it failed with the message \"Unable to connect to the VNC server using your chosen security settings\". The connection dialog box has a drop down for Encryption, which defaults to \"Let VNC Server choose\" but there are four more options, I tried all but none of them works. Thus, assuming that it is some problem with Ubuntu's desktop sharing.\nResearch on the internet showed that disabling encryption (using dconf) resolves the problem link. The help on desktop sharing does not talk anything about this, thus I am not sure if I should follow that procedure. Besides what if I want encryption enabled? Also the solution asks to uncheck remote-access > enabled, isn't that disabling remote access?\nI am hoping to get a solution from a expert and basically looking for the authentic method to correctly configure desktop sharing. Short answer followed by details would be appreciated.\nJust reading this page and seems like it is discussing the known issue of Vino. Not yet sure which version of Ubuntu it applies to. But the problem is similar and the most likely solution is to install a different vnc server. (Not sure how it would integrate with desktop sharing application - will keep reading.)\n\nA: I mistakenly answered the question in the question section above. Copying the answer here...\nFinally, after reading a few articles, I figured out the best possible solution:\n\n\n*\n\n*As Vino (Desktop Sharing) has issues, just don't use it.\n\n*Access Ubuntu Software Center\n\n*Search for vnc server\n\n*x11vnc server turns up as the top rated server, install it.\n\n*Enable/Disable SSL encryption, Listening on LocalHost or file\ntransfer as the need be.\n\n*Use a VNC client of choice on Windows and connect.\n\n\n(I enabled SSL but my vnc viewer opens an unencrypted connection for some reason.)\nUse ssvnc on Windows to fix this problem. I found this link helpful. Note v1.0.29 probably has a virus or a spyware (Firefox or Antivirus blocks it) use the earlier version.\n\nA: Thanks for the comments that gave me lots of insight, yet it did not work for me. In the end this is the way that I found.\nIn the target computer:\nsudo apt-get install x11vnc\nx11vnc -storepasswd (then enter some password)         \nx11vnc -usepw [-ncache]\n\nIf you are trying to start the x11vnc server from a putty/ssh connection, try this:\nx11vnc -usepw -display :0 [-ncache]\n\nIn the connecting computer:\nvncviewer computer-name:1    \n\nDone!

You'll need two lines.  For example:\nPort 22\nListenAddress InternetIP\nListenAddress ServerIP\n\n\nThe next consideration point is that you need to use port forwarding if your server is behind NAT or a router.  This will need to be configured at your router or firewall device, in order to get from the Internet (Public) IP to the internal (private) IP address of your server.\nNOTE: This is NOT the same as an 'allow' rule in the firewall on the server.\n\nA: Perhaps I'm missing something, but nowhere in your question do I see a \"remote\" IP address. I only see 192.168.x.x, which is only available inside your lan.  If you want to connect from outside the lan, you need to use an external (public) address, which is the real address as seen from the outside.  If it's a dynamic address, you either need to make sure it is current, or use a dynamic DNS service such as DynDNS.\nAlso, you need to open the port on your router, and make sure it's directed to the server for port 22.\nAdded Information\nIf you want easy outside access to one or more servers on your system, you might want to look into Dynamic DNS.  There are free services that require periodic access or perhaps other requirements.  The one I use (dyndns.org) used to have a free service, but now costs $25/year.  I use it for remote access to a web server, and also my calibre ebook server.  It allow you to choose a domain name from a big list, and add a prefix to make it personal.  For example, you can choose homelinux.net, and add any number of names, such as \"atavel.homelinux.net\"; you run a standard updater periodically on your home system that will read your actual ip address, and update dynDNS in case of change.  It's not very complicated, really.\n", "Q: How to remove some packages which contain a certain keyword?

Is there a way to do it?\n\nA: apt-get supports regular expressions. Just include a ., * or ? in the package name to make it an expression:\napt-get remove 'xfce.'\n\nFrom man apt-get:\nIf no package matches the given expression and the expression\ncontains one of '.', '?' or '*' then it is assumed to be a POSIX\nregular expression, and it is applied to all package names in the\ndatabase. Any matches are then installed (or removed). Note that\nmatching is done by substring so 'lo.*' matches 'how-lo' and\n'lowest'.

Usually I would just give it time and it would catch back up with itself (5 minutes or so). Recently, that hasn't been working. Essentially it's as if the entire desktop display freezes in place (except the mouse). Blinking things stop blinking and stay static. Things I hover over become unresponsive to the mouse. Back when it would catch up with itself, I could click something with the mouse and it would happen after the freeze stopped. Now it doesn't unfreeze and I have to switch to tty1 and issue sudo poweroff to fix the problem.

Haven't installed any display drivers. Thought it was related to flash. Was mistaken. Switching displays and issuing sudo service lightdm restart seems to be my best option.\n\nA: Sounds like something was wrong the whole time, and now some change has occurred to keep it from eventually \"righting\" itself.  Since your virtual terminals still work, the problem has to do with your desktop.  Are you using appropriate video drivers?  Which word processor and web browser apps do you use?  Which version of Ubuntu?  Also, do your hardware specs meet minimum requirements for your version of Ubuntu?.  After all that, consider what your desktop is doing, such as screen effects.  I hope this helps!\n\nA: Like I was saying, it shouldn't have been doing that in the first place.  Install the package linux-image-extra-(yourversionhere) -- it's got the i915 and radeon drivers, which you should need one of.  Ya, libreoffice and firefox use quite a few threads, not to mention a fair amount of graphics processing.  Now if your system can speak to the gpu in the right language AND let it do more of the work, your stuff should run a lot smoother.

I used a iPad app that allowed this for windows machines using the google servers; I tried to find/adapt the solution to forward a VNC connection to my linux desktops without success. \nIf you have an external machine where you can do ssh, you can make a reverse tunnel; suppose you have the hidden machine named \"hidden\", running the ssh daemon, and the external machine called \"hub\", also running ssh daemon; you can on hidden do (this should be in a script automatically started, checking for failure and restarting, etc.)  \nssh -e none -R 2222:localhost:22 hub \n\nand then connecting to hub with \nssh hub -p 2222 \n\nyour connection will be tunneled to hidden. You can change port 22 to 5900 to forward for example VNC (Desktop) connections. \nObviously, you need to reach hub --- its port 2222 should be opened. Otherwise, if hub has just port 22 (standard ssh) open, you can ssh into hub and there do \nssh localhost -p 2222 \n\nand you are again forwarded to hidden. \n", "Q: Set different java version for different programs I use some programs that have known bugs when using Java 1.7.x (default on my computer), issues that would be fixed using Java 1.6.

It needs to be exported, and should contain the path of the bin subdirectory of the java version. Also, the same directory should be first (or before /usr/bin) in PATH.\nThe variable can be set in a script used to start an individual program.\nYou could find the bin directories of installed versions using something like\n$ locate -b '\\appletviewer'\n\nFor details on setting the variable, see Setting JAVA_HOME.\nThere is a similar variable JDK_HOME for the JDK.\n", "Q: Problems on deleting a partition from USB key and format it in fat32?

Some scripts just append the host/domain; in this case the option 'An entry matches if the host component of its URL is contained in the target window title' should be enabled.\nSources:\nhttp://keepass.info/features.html#lnkdragdrop\nhttp://keepass.info/help/v2/plugins.html\nhttp://keepass.info/plugins.html\n", "Q: how to remove postgresql and phppgadmin from xampp stack I installed lampp from https://bitnami.com/stack/lamp on my pc running ubuntu 14.04\ni also installed the postgresql addon too from https://bitnami.com/stack/postgresql\nCurrently i can't seem to login and have messed up my configuration.\nI want to totally remove the postgresql addon \nThanks in advance\n\nA: Try to nuke by using the command \nsudo dpkg --purge postgresql-XXX\nIn the place of XXX add the version. \n\nA: I finally figure it out.\nPostgreSql module is installed in the directory /opt/lampp/postgresql\nTo remove it just run the command\nsudo /opt/lampp/postgresql/uninstall \n\n", "Q: com.canonical.indicator.sound visible key is gone I was missing the sound indicator from the xfce4 unity notification indicator panel, so I tried the steps in Sound icon missing from top menu to fix it.\nI discovered that com.canonical.indicator.sound visible is literally gone.

When this backup is complete then run rsync again to a remote server via SSH.\nI have a nagging feeling that this won't work properly - something to do with how rsync marks files as already backed up and not changed since last backup.\nAm I right to be suspect that this might cause a problem?\nThanks,\nSimon.\n\nA: From the man page:\nDESCRIPTION\n   It [rsync] offers a  large  number  of  options\n   that  control  every  aspect  of  its behavior and permit very flexible\n   specification of the set of files to be copied.  It is famous  for  its\n   delta-transfer  algorithm,  which  reduces the amount of data sent over\n   the network by sending only the differences between  the  source  files\n   and  the  existing  files in the destination.\n\nOut-of-the box, without any special parameters, rsync will do exactly as you need: \n\n\n*\n\n*sync all differences to the NAS and sync all differences to the remote SSH server.\n\n*The first time you run it, it will create a full copy on both, and then sync the 2 independently.\n\n\nEven when the connection to the remote server is dropped, it will just continue where it left off next time it's invoked. \n", "Q: File system went read only after adding ssh key I followed this guide to set up ssh key on my digital ocean droplet, but since I made step 4 my file system went read-only. I changed /etc/ssh/sshd_config from PermitRootLogin yes to PermitRootLogin without-password and then reload ssh; and when I logged back in, I had no writing rights anymore.\nI can log in using ssh root@123.45.67.89 but it does not ask me for any password, and I can not modify any file.\nBefore doing this, I upgraded my ubuntu from 12.04 to 14.04, it asked me during the upgrade which setting did I want for PermitRootLogin and when I looked at /etc/ssh/sshd_config after the installation (and after adding my ssh key) it was set on PermitRootLogin yes.\n--- update ---\nAfter reading this answer I ran dmesg | grep \"EXT4-fs error\" to see if I have any issues related to the filesystem / journaling system itself.\nIt returned many times:\n[68241.757233] EXT4-fs error (device vda): htree_dirblock_to_tree:892: inode #533953: block 2108070: comm updatedb.mlocat: bad entry in directory: rec_len is smaller than minimal - offset=0(0), inode=0, rec_len=0, name_len=0\nWhat should I do?\n\nA: You must setup root password:\nsudo passwd\nThen restart the ssh service:\nsudo service ssh reload\nNote: permitting root access especially without password is quite dangerous it makes your system highly vulnerable to external threats.\n", "Q: Fail to resolve ip address I tried to diagnose internet problem myself\nifconfig:\neth0      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr f8:a9:63:3f:9e:97  \n  UP BROADCAST MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1\n  RX packets:0 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0\n  TX packets:0 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0\n  collisions:0 txqueuelen:1000 \n  RX bytes:0 (0.0 B)  TX bytes:0 (0.0 B)\n  Interrupt:16 \n\nlo        Link encap:Local Loopback  \n  inet addr:127.0.0.1  Mask:255.0.0.0\n  inet6 addr: ::1/128 Scope:Host\n  UP LOOPBACK RUNNING  MTU:65536  Metric:1\n  RX packets:185 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0\n  TX packets:185 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0\n  collisions:0 txqueuelen:0 \n  RX bytes:13343 (13.3 KB)  TX bytes:13343 (13.3 KB)\n\nI see no resolved IP address under eth0, so I tried to edit /etc/network/interfaces file\nadd line\nauto eth0\niface eth0 inet dhcp\n\nnow it contains\nauto lo\niface lo inet loopback\nauto eth0\niface eth0 inet dhcp\n\nafter restart the service by\nsudo service networking restart\n\nThe eth0 item in output of ifconfig is totally gone\nnow\nifconfig\nlo        Link encap:Local Loopback  \n  inet addr:127.0.0.1  Mask:255.0.0.0\n  inet6 addr: ::1/128 Scope:Host\n  UP LOOPBACK RUNNING  MTU:65536  Metric:1\n  RX packets:185 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0\n  TX packets:185 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0\n  collisions:0 txqueuelen:0 \n  RX bytes:13343 (13.3 KB)  TX bytes:13343 (13.3 KB)\n\nHow is this supposed to be happened ?\n\nA: I believe that lack of dhcp server may be a problem here. In such a case you will need to setup static IP in interfaces (make sure about dhcp with whoever manages the network)\niface eth0 inet dhcp\ndhcp means that interface should look for dhcp server which will assign IP to it.\nAnd if there's no dhcp server in the network something like this may be needed:\niface eth0 inet static\naddress 192.168.1.50\nnetmask 255.255.255.0\ngateway 192.168.1.1\nThese are just examples - all depends on actual network.\nIf unsure whether you have dhcp in your network or not - you can try to run dhclient command which will try to assign IP from dhcp to your interface. If there's no result - there's apparently no dhcp in your network or it may not work properly.\nI hope that will help at least to diagnose the problem a bit.\n", "Q: How to set proxy server to work from the command line I have set up my proxy server so that it works through the browser ( in firefox: edit > preferences > advanced < network < settings ).\nI also got it working from the command line ( in system settings: network < network proxy ) which has been working fine for the last few weeks.\nSuddenly connecting to the internet through the command line has stopped working but connecting through the browser still works fine.\nDoes anyone know why this could happen and how to fix it?

There is an old gitosis install guide at the Community Wiki where one of the opening paragraphs is the following:\n\nWARNING This guide is written for Gitosis, which has been out of\n  active devolpment since 2008, and no is longer available in later\n  versions of Ubuntu such as Version 12.04. Gitosis seems to have been\n  replaced by Gitolite.\n\nI have no experience with Gitolite and could not find that much information about it on the web. Is this still the recommended Git server for Ubuntu 14.04? Or would you recommend something different?\n\nA: I use Gitlab (which used to be based on gitolite but now uses their own gitlab-shell). The Community Edition is relatively easy to set up on Ubuntu (compared to, say Gitorious), since it is a monolithic Debian package. The software is well-maintained (I think at least a release around every couple of months).\nOf course, whether you need the features (web UI, LDAP, etc.) that Gitlab offers is open to debate.\n\nI should also point out that the LTS Server Guide uses Gitolite for setting up a git server (\"[the] suggested solution\"). This should not be seen as an official endorsement, since the LTS guide also ignores nginx in favour of Apache when it comes to web servers.\n", "Q: Ubuntu laptop when clsing lid no more wifi When I close the lid on my laptop and then open it again and sign in the wifi does not work anymore.\nI have already tried to restart the network manager with sudo service network-manager restart but that didn't help!\nAnyone knows what the problem might be\n\nA: I think, you have to check \nsystem->preferences->power management, and this is the place where you can set, how the laptop has to behave when the lid is closed.\n", "Q: Configuring wondershaper I am currently using wondershaper to limit my bandwidth. \nTo test out the bandwidth limiter, I have set up FTP transfers using Filezilla and vsftpd server.

Why is sssd an unrecognized service, even though it is installed and can be restarted?\nBTW: This concerns Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS, it was not like that in 12.04\nI will show what I mean below, I think it is a bug but I am interested in an explanation and/or workaround.\nroot@tauriel:~/scripts# service sssd\n**sssd: unrecognized service**\nroot@tauriel:~/scripts# service sssd status\nsssd start/running, process 22454\nroot@tauriel:~/scripts# service sssd restart\nsssd stop/waiting\nsssd start/running, process 22485\nroot@tauriel:~/scripts# service sssd status\nsssd start/running, process 22485\nroot@tauriel:~/scripts# service sssd\n**sssd: unrecognized service**\nroot@tauriel:~/scripts# \n\nBTW: sssd is apparently a new tag, it would be nice if it was added.\n\nA: When you run service, if there's a sysv init script, it will call that script (or call Upstart, if it's an Upstart job):\n$ service ssh\n * Usage: /etc/init.d/ssh {start|stop|reload|force-reload|restart|try-restart|status}\n$ service gdm\n/etc/init.d/gdm: 79: /etc/init.d/gdm: Syntax error: \"fi\" unexpected (expecting \"}\")\n\nNaturally if you don't pass a command (restart, status, etc.), only these scripts will be able to respond. If the init file for a service is Upstart-only, this will fail:\n$ service tty1\ntty1: unrecognized service\n\nSSSD only offers an Upstart init script, as you can see from the list of files in sssd-common.\n\nThis behaviour is not exactly well documented in the manpage. However, if you examine the service command, which is a shell script:\n118 if [ -r \"/etc/init/${SERVICE}.conf\" ] && which initctl >/dev/null \\\n119    && initctl version | grep -q upstart\n120 then\n121    # Upstart configuration exists for this job and we're running on upstart\n122    case \"${ACTION}\" in  \n\nThe actions in this case consists of exec calls of initctl (via its symlinked versions - start, stop, etc.). Since the ACTION variable is empty and doesn't match any case, it falls through to:\n138 \n139 # Otherwise, use the traditional sysvinit\n140 if [ -x \"${SERVICEDIR}/${SERVICE}\" ]; then\n141    exec env -i LANG=\"$LANG\" PATH=\"$PATH\" TERM=\"$TERM\" \"$SERVICEDIR/$SERVICE\" ${ACTION} ${OPTIONS}\n142 else\n143    echo \"${SERVICE}: unrecognized service\" >&2\n144    exit 1\n145 fi\n\nHere you can see why it produces that error.\n", "Q: Pinging 8.8.8.8 Ubuntu server I was wondering if someone could explain to me why when I ping 8.8.8.8 there are several results such as: \n64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=1 ttl 42 time=37.8 ms\n\nThis goes on and on well into the hundreds.

I'm new at ubuntu server so any help is appreciated.\nI am connected via a cisco router/modem at home but with a static ip.\nI'm using a business account however.\n\nA: By default, ping doesn't stop sending packets until you hit Ctrl+C to send the KeyboardInterrupt signal (which tells the program to stop pinging and generate statistics).  As such, you get hundreds of those lines, indicating the round-trip time, which ping packet you're getting echoed back to you (as you get them sent in sequence of 1, 2, 3, ...), and what the time it took to echo back to you was.\nIf you only want to send, say, 5 packets with each ping, you would use the -c flag and put 5 there, which instructs the system to send 5 packets and wait for 5 responses (or for the responses to time out).  The command would then be ping -c 5 8.8.8.8, using the default timeout settings embedded into the program.\n", "Q: How to install wkhtmltopdf 0.12.1 on Ubuntu server?

I also disabled fast boot in the Control Panel before attempting this.\nMy PC is a Lenovo y510p laptop that came preloaded with Windows 8.1.

However, I cannot add an event in Lightning which is then uploaded to the outlook calendar.\nIs there any calendar tool for Linux which interacts well with the online outlook calendar in both directions?\n\nA: For exactly the same scenario I'm currently using mailbox.org which offers the total package starting from 2.5€/month: E-mails with easy PGP integration, calendars, contacts, tasks, word processing, and file sharing. It's actually a very nice alternative for something like Dropbox or Google Docs.\nWindows Phone sync of emails, calendars, contacts and tasks works. I'm using their ActiveSync endpoint for that, but they provide (and actually prefer) the open standards as well. The company speaks openly about its values and as far as I can tell it actually lives them. Privacy is central, it exceeds the high german standards.\nThe solution @KhurshidAlam proposed in his comment (which he could perfectly turn into an answer) is also excellent because it proposes using a very Open Source-friendly web service called fruux.\n\nWe are behind sabre/dav, which is the most popular open source implementation of the WebDAV, CardDAV and CalDAV standards. Besides us, developers and companies around the globe use our sabre/dav technology to deliver sync functionality to millions of users. \n\nIt is also located in Germany, so it has high privacy standards to comply to.

The sites referenced above give a detailed explanation about the commands and additional ones to check the status of the connections and devices.\nAutomatic Configuration on Boot\nThere is another method to connect to the network at startup (and possibly with ifup/ifdown), by adding the configuration to /etc/network/interfaces.

How can I achive the same functionality in Ubuntu with nautilus?\nFor example, to insert this image to (say) facebook, I could enter the URL as I browse:\n\n\nAnd click Open. But on Ubuntu nothing happens.\n\nA: This seems to be a limitation of the GTK+. You can't force its file selector to do something it just can't currently do. Any applications that use the GTK+ file selector widget are going to have the same problems.\nHowever applications that use the Qt equivalent (and therefore all KDE applications and many others), can open directly from HTTP links. I have tested this in Kate.\n\nI'm not sure what solution you want here. You could probably spend some time hacking this into the relevant GTK library so that it functions like this in the future. You could then submit that upstream and it'd eventually be the default (if accepted).\nBut the quicker route for this is either:\n\n\n*\n\n*Using an application that uses QT (or another framework that does this)\n\n*Find another workflow.\n\n\n\nIn the context a browser, no browsers that I have tested (including GTK and Qt widget based ones) were capable of opening a remote URI for a file selection.\nAs mentioned earlier, Qt is technically capable of this but in Rekonq (the Qt browser I tested) it seemed limited to local files only. This may be something that could be worked on. For the GTK+ browsers (most of them) work needs to be done at on GTK before they'll work.\nIn short, fixing this in the browser isn't going to be practical for anybody.\n\nThat said you might be able to create a FUSE-based filesystem that read from the clipboard and provided a fake filesystem that contained one file (which then streamed data from the URL using something like the python-requests library).\nYou could then just select that file in the browser and it'd work like any other file.\nThis isn't a small project (hence the lack of code) but it would be quite achievable to somebody with a little bit of Python experience.\n", "Q: How to --install-suggests on an already installed package?

Ubuntu 14.10 is not compatible with PATA. Your system may be too slow to run Ubuntu anyway. Even in try mode.

I installed workrave through the terminal and the first time it launched the small window with the countdown timer displayed and it worked as it should. I closed the window and from then on I could never get it displayed again. I did an uninstall/reinstall, but that didn't work, and I also found out that the applet for workrave doesn't work in gnome shell. In the tweak tool settings under extensions the workrave option is greyed out and has a triangle warning sign.\nThe program can still be launched and works, but I can't set up my preferences because there's no window for me to interact with. Is there a way to bring back the workrave window so I can change my preferences?\n\nA: Alright, so I happened upon the solution by playing around with the tweak tool.

(No problem there either!) \nMy question is: Is there a way for me to save daily changes from my virtual machine to my Ubuntu installed (unlike liveCD) USB pendrive so I can use that to boot and continue where I left off on my Virtualbox?\nNote: I installed Ubuntu 14.04 on a 64gb pendrive with 4 partitions. One 8gb fat32, the 2nd is /home, the 3rd is Linux Swap and the last 5.3gb is just an empty parition.\n\nA: If I understand you correctly, what you want to do, is use your flash drive as the 'harddrive' in Virtualbox. This way all your changes will be reflected on the flash drive.\nIn order to do this, you will need to make a virtual hard drive that points to the physical device, then use the virtual hard drive with Virtualbox.\nUse the following command, replacing /dev/sda with the device that is your flash drive\nsudo VBoxManage internalcommands createrawvmdk -filename /path/to/file.vmdk -rawdisk /dev/sda\nSee https://superuser.com/questions/495025/use-physical-harddisk-in-virtual-box for more details.\nIf what you're trying to do, is run two individual systems in Virtualbox and on the Flash Drive, and then 'synchronise' the changes back and forth, you can use rsync to synchronise the files, if both systems are running at the same time. \nBut you can't synchronise all the files, as that'd definitely cause problems unless the two systems are identical, so you will have to settle for something like your home directory for instance. Seeing as you have /home on a separate partition, you can also use my above instructions to make a virtual hard drive that points to that single partition, and mount it with Virtualbox.\n\nA: After running some test and actually using it, here's the command for rsync that I am happy with:\nrsync -aAXv –exclude={“/dev/*”,”/proc/*”,”/sys/*”,”/tmp/*”,”/run/*”,”/mnt/*”,”/media/*”,”/lost+found”, “/boot/*”} /media/sda1/* /media/sdb1/ –delete -u --dry-run\n\nIf I am satisfied, I remove --dry-run to make the changes.\n", "Q: 14.10 Windows home network connection keeps asking for password I have a home network on a HP Media Smart Server with Windows Home Server OS and a HTPC with Ubuntu 14.10.\nEverything is working great with the exception that I cannot access my home network.\nWhen I go to files, browse network the Ubuntu machine sees the Home Server and the other computer running Windows 7 but when I enter my password it will not connect.

How can I tell which DNS servers DNSMasq is using to resolve a name to an IP address?\nI can't figure it out.  All of the existing questions here seem to just go as far as telling users that they are using DNSMasq.\n\nA: Generally, for the system using systemd, the DNS servers dnsmasq is using can be found via\n\njournalctl -u dnsmasq\n\n\nA: For a more generic answer when you are using dnsmasq without network manager and with several upstream DNS :\nsh# kill -USR1 <PID OF DNSMASQ>\nsh# tail /var/log/syslog\n\nUpon receiving SIGUSR1, dnsmasq will log various statistics, including the number of DNS request send to each upstream server. Based on that, you can easily determine the most frequently used DNS server on your system.\n\nA: You can find the DNS servers with the NetworkManagerCLI (nmcli) tool:\nnmcli dev show | grep DNS\nIP4.DNS[1]:                             172.22.216.251\nIP6.DNS[1]:                             2a01:4f0:400c:1::1\n\nUbuntu 14.04 and older\nThe command is slightly different in older (<15.04) versions of Ubuntu:\n> nmcli dev list | grep DNS\nIP4.DNS[1]:                             172.22.216.251\nIP6.DNS[1]:                             2a01:4f0:400c:1::1\n\n\nA: In package:\nnetwork-manager 0.9.8.8-0ubuntu7.2 amd64 \n\nThe command is:\nroot@D-MIS-001:~# nmcli dev list | grep DNS\nIP4.DNS[1]:                             172.16.10.173\nIP4.DNS[2]:                             172.16.10.133\n\nThis is what seems to be the current package version for Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.  The correct command for 15.* may have changed.\n\nA: It's also possible to ask NetworkManager by DBus directly. (This is what nmcli does under the hood). For example, on Ubuntu 14.04 or later, run (without the leading $):\n$ env -i gdbus introspect -y -o /org/freedesktop/NetworkManager/IP4Config -d org.freedesktop.NetworkManager | perl -ne 'if (m@^  node (\\d+) [{]$@) { $_ = readpipe(\"env -i gdbus introspect -y -o /org/freedesktop/NetworkManager/IP4Config/$1 -d org.freedesktop.NetworkManager\\n\"); while (m@ Nameservers = \\[(?!\\])((?=\\d)[\\d, ]*\\d)\\]@g) { for (split(m@, *@, $1)) { print join(\".\", unpack(\"C4\", pack(\"I\", $_))), \"\\n\" } } }'\n12.34.56.78\n90.123.45.6\n\nFor a more indirect approach, use ActiveConnection instead of IP4Config.\n\nA: On Ubuntu 15.04 the command is:\n$ nmcli dev show | grep DNS\nIP4.DNS[1]:                             8.8.8.8\n\n\nA: I'm expanding the answers given by others, showing sligthly longer commands, which print only the DNS servers.\nUbuntu 14.04 has nmcli 0.9.8.8 in the network-manager package. The list of DNS servers is within the output of nmcli -f IP4 -t -m tabular dev list. To get only the list of DNS servers, run (without the leading $):\n$ env -i nmcli -f IP4 -t -m tabular dev list | perl -ne 'chomp; my @l = split(m@:@, $_); if (@l > 3) { $_ = $l[3]; if (m@^\\d+(?=[.])[\\d. |]+[.]\\d+$@) { for (split(m@ *[|] *@, $_)) { print \"$_\\n\" } } }'\n12.34.56.78\n90.123.45.6\n\nUbuntu 15.04 or later also has nmcli in the network-manager package, but expects different command-line arguments. The list of DNS servers is within the output of nmcli -f IP4.DNS -t -m tabular dev show. To get only the list of DNS servers, run (without the leading $):\n$ env -i nmcli -f IP4.DNS -t -m tabular dev show | perl -ne 'if (m@^\\d+(?=[.])[\\d. |]+[.]\\d+$@) { chomp; for (split(m@ *[|] *@, $_)) { print \"$_\\n\" } }'\n12.34.56.78\n90.123.45.6\n\nSince nmcli connects to NetworkManager via DBus, the command above works for any connections managed by NetworkManager, even for those which don't use dnsmasq. However, not all connections are managed by NetworkManager. The list of DNS servers should be extracted from the file /etc/resolv.conf, and if it contains addresses starting with 127.0., NetworkManager should be consulted. Here is how to extract:\n$ perl -ne 'print \"$1\\n\" if m@^\\s*nameserver\\s+(\\S+)\\s*$@' /etc/resolv.conf \n127.0.1.1\n\nPlease note that 127.0.1.1 (and possibly others) indicates dnsmasq, and 127.0.0.53 indicates systemd-resolved.\nIf the current active connection is not managed by NetworkManager (and systemd-resolved), then the DNS servers will be enumerated in the file /etc/resolv.conf.\n", "Q: Switch to another running application from terminal Let's say I have opened Firefox Browser and Libre Office, and then I opened Terminal. Can I, from Terminal use a command to switch back to Firefox.?\n\nA: You can do it using wmctrl. To install it use in terminal,\nsudo apt-get install wmctrl\n\nTo switch to firefox use the following command in terminal,\nwmctrl -a firefox\n\nActually it switch to a window with name containing 'firefox' in it. see man wmctrl for more.\n", "Q: kernel is outdated I have troubles with updating my kernel.

That time I've made some weird tricks with manual installation of header packages, but I think there should be nicer way to get system on track with kernel updating.\nEdit:\nHere are my /boot contents that clearly show that there are no newer kernels installed: ls /boot\nabi-3.13.0-27-generic     config-3.2.0-61-generic       memtest86+.bin                System.map-3.2.0-61-generic\nabi-3.13.0-32-generic     grub                          memtest86+.elf                vmlinuz-3.13.0-27-generic\nabi-3.2.0-61-generic      initrd.img-3.13.0-27-generic  memtest86+_multiboot.bin      vmlinuz-3.13.0-32-generic\nconfig-3.13.0-27-generic  initrd.img-3.13.0-32-generic  System.map-3.13.0-27-generic  vmlinuz-3.2.0-61-generic\nconfig-3.13.0-32-generic  initrd.img-3.2.0-61-generic   System.map-3.13.0-32-generic\n\n\nA: My guess is that you did not rebooted your system.\nCurrently you are running 3.13.0-32. The latest kernel version is 3.13.0-40. \nAfter reboot the system will boot in the latest. So all intermediate versions will never be used and can be removed.\nI suggest to use autoremove (sudo apt-get autoremove), then reboot the system and watch if the it has booted to the latest kernel. Finally run autoremove again to erase the currently running.\n\nA: If the system decides to hold back a kernel upgrade, it has its reasons...  (Like you have Oracle's VirtualBox with drivers compiled for your kernel or similar low-level software installed) \nThat being said, if you do want to upgrade your kernel:\n\n\n*\n\n*Do a full system backup (I use CloneZilla)\n\n*just install the latest version by:\nsudo apt-get install linux-generic\n", "Q: Fan control in Ubuntu 14.10. on Asus z97 How to properly set up fan control on Ubuntu 14.10? I have an Asus z97 mini motherboard and while in windows even with heavy load for a long time it does not reach 70 Celsius degree, on Ubuntu easily reach 80 degrees in a few seconds with heavy workload. \nI have read that thermald can help to motorize fan control, but I cannot find too much documentation. \nDoes someone know how can I make the fan to work earlier, so the computer does not reach those high temperatures?\nThanks!\nD.\n\nA: Indeed, Thermald is the software you need and detailed instructions are available at the official Ubuntu site.\nIt's as easy as \nsudo apt-get install thermald\n\non most machines.\nHow I use thermald is in sem-automatic mode: I have 2 /etc/thermald/thermald.conf files and when I need to extend my battery -life, I copy thermald.conf.quiet over the existing file or when performance is needed thermald.conf.performance gets copied over...  \nThis is just one little part of a script that uses pm-powersave, gsettings, ... to regulate my performance settings. (Also, my on-board NVidia is always disabled unless I need it to do heavy-duty gaming or drive my HDMI port.)\nIf you're freaked out about your T°, you want even more finely tuned control and then you need the lm-sensor package which I did fine-tune on 12.04 but whose fine-tuning I lost when my upgrade from 12.04->14.04 crashed my system.  (I have it installed but not fine-tuned yet) so if you want to go down this road, drop me a note.\n", "Q: Build Emacs: cannot find -lpng15 I'm trying to build Emacs 24.4 and this error occured:\n/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lpng15\ncollect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status\nmake[1]: *** [temacs] Error 1\nmake[1]: Leaving directory `/home/nick/apps/emacs-24.4/src'\nmake: *** [src] Error 2\n\nCan anybody tell me what's wrong, and the possible solution?\n\nA: The wrong is that you don't have libpng15 installed.

Then try to compile Emacs again.\n", "Q: Rendered videos have no sound Since I upgraded to 14.10 I can't render videos with sound.

I already had both packages installed and in the same folder, so that's not it.\nTracks are unmuted, audio works fine everywhere else, including the video-editors themselves. It's just after the render that the audio is gone.\n\nA: The solution to this problem is the same as this answer, to a different question.\nYou need newer versions of libmlt6 and libmlt++3 than what Ubuntu 14.10 shipped.  15.04 already has the newer packages.\nYou can work around the problem on your 14.10 system by simply grabbing the newer version from 15.04 and installing them:\ncd $(mktemp -d)\nwget https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+archive/primary/+files/libmlt%2B%2B3_0.9.2%2Bgit20141027-1_amd64.deb\nwget https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+archive/primary/+files/libmlt6_0.9.2%2Bgit20141027-1_amd64.deb\nsudo dpkg -Oi *deb\n\n\nA: VERY bad advice, to install libs from a different release.

Anyway here is my update. Dustin Kirkland's advice may have worked (kind of), but there's more that I did than the commands in the terminal.\n\n\n*\n\n*I tried doing the following after entering the commands suggested by Dustin, and I think the stuff in this step may have worked without doing the updates he suggested. Separate the audio into an mp3 using VLC player, then put it into the audio slot in the session with the video that you are editing in Kdenlive and mute the video in the video slot. Then render the video. If that doesn't work then do the following steps and repeat this one. I think this would have worked in my case because there was one second of sound in the edited videos before I used the mp3.\n\n*Enter what Dustin said to enter into the command prompt.

In details, when I log on, the screen goes off and a power save message is displayed in green color and I have to wait at least 5 minutes for the screen to recover. \nI tried different things but no success. \nPlease I am in urgent need for your help as I have this problem on 15 PCs in our lab at the university.\n\nA: As your problem is power-savings related, please follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to the monitor settings and turn off anything that reeks of 'sleep', 'power management' etc\n\n*Go into the BIOS of your machine and turn off power management there\n\n*As all of these machines are desktops, run the following commands one by one:\nsudo pm-powersave false\nsudo apt-get remove gnome-power-manager\nsudo apt-get remove pm-utils\nsudo apt-get remove acpi-support\n\n\n*Reboot\n", "Q: Black Screen with cursor - Booting from HardDisk & LiveCD \n*\n\n*I've formatted my PC and installed Windows 8 & Ubuntu 14.04.\n\n*I've been working like 1 week with the computer with both OS without any problem\n\n*My motherboard is Asus M2N32\n\n\nSuddenly, one day the computer seems to stuck on booting:\n\n\n*\n\n*If I select Windows in the grub, the computer restarts \n\n*If I select Ubuntu in the grub, just after the selection the computer stuck in a black screen with cursor but I cannot hit ctr+alt+f1 or anything\n\n\nI've checked some questions here, and google around but any of the solutions fix my issue.\nI've tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Start the computer with a Ubuntu 12/13/14 Live CD (same issue)\n\n*Followed My computer boots to black screen without any success (among other tutorials I found googling)\n\n*I tried to boot HardDisk & CD with acpi = off, nolapic and nomodset. \n\n*I've tried unplugging every device on the motherboard but the RAM, GraphicCard and wireless keyboard\n\n*3 graphics card I've tried: Sapphire HD 3650, Nvidia and ATI (I only remember the model of the Sapphire)\n\n*I've tried to boot using boot-repair disk (via USB & CD), and get stuck in the same black screen with cursor blinking\n\n\nI'm thinking the issue may come from the motherboard, but the computer starts without problems and I allways can see/enter/modify the BIOS.\n\n\n*\n\n*Does anyone has any thought or any solution that can be tried ?\n\n\n\nEDIT: It seems the problems is graphic, because I cannot make the computer boot from a Windows XP/7/8 neither (Allways stuck in \"Starting Windows\" black screen)\nThat's weird because I have 3 different graphic cards, and the BIOS menu && Boot Menu is displayed without problems, but when any \"good\" graphic screen is coming, the computer fails... \n\n\n*\n\n*Is the motherboad damaged or there is another explanation for this ?\n\n\nA: Finally solved,\nFirst of all thanks to @LuisAlvarado who points me to run memtest86!\nWhen I run the memtest86 it restarted automatically after few seconds, I realize this means some kind of issues with the RAM memory. \nI removed all my RAM modules and begin to test them 1 by 1 and then I saw the issue with the 3rd module, somehow it's broken and was giving all this issues.\nAnother thing I realized is that the BIOS of the M2N32 has an option Quick Boot set to true, so the motherboard avoid testing the ram, if this option wasn't enabled I could find and fix the issue even faster.\n", "Q: TLP don't change CPU frequency I check CPU clock speed with cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep \"MHz\", After sudo tlp start and sudo tlp bat still frequency is 2100MHz (Maximum). Could you please help me to solve this problem?\nI'm using latest kernel (3.17.4) and because I want to use indicator-cpufreq, I'd some change in grub.\nCan I use indicator-cpufreq and tlp at the same time?\n\nA: Sure, I've never had a problem using them both at the same time.\nFirst, make sure the universe repository is enabled:\nsudo add-apt-repository universe\n\nThen, to install indicator-cpufreq, run the following commands:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install indicator-cpufreq\n\nNow, edit grub. Execute the following command to open a text editor so you can edit the file:\nsudo nano /etc/default/grub\n\nUsing your arrow keys, scroll down to line 11 where it should say this or something similar:\n\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"splash quiet\"\n\nChange the line to say this instead:\n\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"splash quiet intel_pstate=disable\"\n\nNext, press Ctrl + o and then press Enter to accept the changes. Press Ctrl + x to exit the file and then run the following command to update Grub:\nsudo update-grub\n\nReboot the system and if indicator-cpufreq does not show up in the panel automatically, press Alt + F2, type indicator-cpufreq and then press Enter. You should now be able to scale the CPU by clicking on the indicator-cpufreq icon. \"Performance\" is high and \"Ondemand\" only clocks up when it needs to.\n\nAlso, you need edit the TLP configuration file before you use it. Execute the following command to edit the file:\nsudo nano /etc/default/tlp\n\nif you'd rather use gedit instead of nano, you can use either one of these commands instead: gksu gedit /etc/default/tlp or sudo gedit /etc/default/tlp.\nScroll down to where you see these two lines:\n\n#CPU_SCALING_GOVERNOR_ON_AC=ondemand\n\n\n#CPU_SCALING_GOVERNOR_ON_BAT=ondemand\n\nEdit those lines by removing the comment (pound symbol) from the beginning or each line and change \"ondemand\" to \"performance\" like you see here:\n\nCPU_SCALING_GOVERNOR_ON_AC=performance\nCPU_SCALING_GOVERNOR_ON_BAT=performance\n\nAnother line you probably want to change is this one:\n\nDISK_APM_LEVEL_ON_BAT=\"128 128\"\n\nThat setting can sometimes cause excessive wear on your hard drive by causing it to spin down way too often. The best thing to do is to set it to the same setting used by AC power. So, change 128 128 to  254 254 like in this example:\n\nDISK_APM_LEVEL_ON_BAT=\"254 254\"\n\nAnd, you probably don't want wifi power management either. Scroll down to:\n\nWIFI_PWR_ON_BAT=0\n\nand change that to:\n\nWIFI_PWR_ON_BAT=1\n\nYou may want to change a couple of others depending on user preference.\nSave the file before you exit and restart TLP for the changes to take effect.\nBy setting TLP to \"performance\" you basically turn the scaling function off. This allows indicator-cpufreq to handle frequency scaling without conflict.\nIf you ever want to scale the frequency down, click on the indicator-cpufreq icon on the top panel and choose \"ondemand\", \"powersave\", or whatever to allow the CPU to wind down for better efficiency.\nFinally, don't forget you need to remove \"laptop-mode-tools\" if you have not done so already or you may encounter issues. To do this, you can run the following command from an open terminal:\nsudo apt-get remove laptop-mode-tools\n\n\nNOTE:\nAccording to user @antoine-viallon, using intel_pstate=passive instead of intel_pstate=disable enables turbo-boost frequencies while allowing linux to set the frequency itself but I have not tested this.\n", "Q: Should I upgrade Ubuntu 14.04 LTS?

May be a problem for executing a file, since it doesn't save executable permissions either, but it sounds like you won't actually be storing executable files there, just media (movies, pics, etc).\nOr for a permissions-aware FS (like ext) making a group containing all the wanted users, then giving that group rwx permissions for the folders in question should work... (may have trouble with new folders though, not sure there)\n\nA: *\n\n*create a partition using Gparted. I recommend you to format it with NTFS (it will not be much fragmented since it will hold only big media files, unlike C drive. fat32 on the ,other hand, will not allow to copy/save files larger than 5GB. Also NTFS can be mounted when in windows)\n\n*Open up Disk program from dash. click on the partition and then click on gear icon below (as shown)\n\n\n\nyou will get many options, click on Edit mount option.\n\n\n*\n\n*a small window will open then toggle Automatic mount option to OFF\n\n*if you want to change the location of mounting, give a path in mount location ( i recommend mouting in /media folder this will make the mounted partition to appear on side in nautilus). you can also change the name by which it will be mounted in Identify as ( i recommend using label)\n\n*then press OK. \n\n", "Q: How to integrate google adressbook into contacts?

The JDK is already installed on my system (1.7 version), but when I use apt-get install tomcat7 I get the below error:\nSetting up tomcat7-common (7.0.52-1ubuntu0.1) ...\nSetting up tomcat7 (7.0.52-1ubuntu0.1) ...\n\nCreating config file /etc/default/tomcat7 with new version\nAdding system user `tomcat7' (UID 108) ...\nAdding new user `tomcat7' (UID 108) with group `tomcat7' ...\nNot creating home directory `/usr/share/tomcat7'.\n\nCreating config file /etc/logrotate.d/tomcat7 with new version\n * Starting Tomcat servlet engine tomcat7                                **[fail]**\n\nI tried all solutions I could find on the Internet, like: \n\n\n*\n\n*Uninstalled tomcat7 using apt-get purge tomcat7 or apt-get autoremove tomcat7 and again installed but got the same error. :( \n\n*Tried apt-get update, remove tomcat7 and again installed but failed.\n\n*Set the CATALINA path in .bashrc or /etc/environment. But got no luck.\nNote: I have installed the same tomcat7 on my local Ubuntu 14.04 server and it installed correctly in a first attempt. \n\nA: I was able to solve this by installing the package libtomcat7-Java.  This appears to be the missing dependency.\nsudo apt-get install libtomcat7-java \n\n\nA: I understand this problem. It is caused by (a) splitting Tomcat parts into different FS places (/etc, /var, /usr/lib, /usr/share etc) (b) assigning wrong ownership (=permissions) to e.g. logs and temp directory. Then user tomcat7 just can't even write its complaint on startup.\nSimple solution is to install tgz from tomcat.apache.org (and start it manually; ok if you develop with tc). Another is just read startup script, learn what dirs are to be updated, check their ownership. Wasy hack is to add user tomcat7 to group root, that usually has write bits.\n\nA: I also tried installation through binary method (tgz).After that tomcat is service is working fine and http://My_Ip:8080 is also working but when checked the /var/log/tomcat/ logs its showing some error,\n at\n org.apache.catalina.core.ContainerBase$StopChild.call(ContainerBase.java:1564)\n at java.util.concurrent.FutureTask.run(FutureTask.java:262) at\n java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.runWorker(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:1145)\n at\n java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor$Worker.run(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:615)\n at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:745)\n\n Dec 08, 2014 10:12:47 AM org.apache.coyote.AbstractProtocol stop INFO:\n Stopping ProtocolHandler [\"http-bio-8080\"] Dec 08, 2014 10:12:47 AM\n org.apache.coyote.AbstractProtocol destroy INFO: Destroying\n ProtocolHandler [\"http-bio-8080\"]\n\n\nA: I had the same problem with tomcat8, and I was able to solve the problem by removing tomcat8-common:\nsudo apt-get purge tomcat8-common\n\nI hope this will help other people who have the same problem.\n", "Q: share home directory by samba in ubuntu I have installed samba on my Ubuntu server.\nI do changes on smb.config and I can connect from my windows to the share file which I create in a path /srv/samba/share with using [share] part and creating that folder\nafter that I wanted to share my home directory\nI changed [homes] with some options to be accessible and I use smbpasswd to create a user and password.\nwhen I open my network I can see the share folder which is accessible and homes folder which is shared but I can not access to the homes folder.\nhow can I open it and where I need that user which I create by smbpasswd.\nIt is not accessible.\nPlease help me to share my home directory. \n\nA: [Ubuntu]\nPath = /home\nAvailable = yes\nValid users = ubuntu\nRead only = no\nBrowsable = yes\nPublic = yes\nWritable = yes\n\n", "Q: How do I connect to an Ubuntu server via SSH from OSX? I recently downloaded OpenSSH on my ubuntu server; though I don't have a domain name yet I do have another device (running OSX) on the same LAN as my server.\nIs it possible to connect to the server? since both devices are on the same LAN, and osX already has an ssh client (terminal)?\nIf it's not possible, I would like to know why.\n\nA: If they are on the same LAN, it should be possible to connect using IPs.\nThe syntax for ssh is pretty simple. The minimum you need to specify is the target IP or hostname. The following are effectively the same for me:\nssh github.com\nssh 192.30.252.130\n\nIf you don't specify a username, your client's user is applied. So, for me, the above commands are the same as:\nssh muru@192.30.252.130\nssh -l muru 192.30.252.130\n\nIf you don't specify a port, 22 is assumed. So the first two commands are the same as:\nssh 192.30.252.130 -p 22\n\nUnlike other programs, the IP:port syntax is not applicable here.\nFor everything else, there's the manpage.\nThis is all assuming that your client is similar to the OpenSSH client. For anything else, consult its manpage.\n", "Q: Ubuntu doesn't work with my laptop I have been trying to use Ubuntu 14.04 on my HP Pavilion laptop with a AMD Turion64 x2 processor. I've tried using \"Try Ubuntu\" with both the 32 and 64 bit editions. (run from separate DVD disks burned from ISO) I have tried an actual install of 14.04.

Works fine.\n\nA: Sounds like a similar issue to me.\nI did a clean install of ubuntu 14.04 on my hp nx6325 with a turion 64x2 cpu.\nat the moment mine works but doesnt shutdown probably because the Modem was unrecognised and therefore causes issues.\ni was advised on here to do the Ctrl-Alt-F6 to switch screens to see the login/text screen. This allows you to see the error messages displayed.\nmost likely a faulty driver is preventing it from continuing (finishing its login)\nso the differences between our pcs might be\n1) the modem(if any)\n2) blutooth(if any)\n3) the wireless card make/model\n4) the Lan make/model.\nyou could try disabling the wireless card/blutooth in the bios then do a complete re-install, then maybe you will be in the same state as me.\n", "Q: monitor outgoing email I have a VPS and recently I found some unusual activity looking at the /var/log/mail.log and so I installed pflogsumm to send a daily report and got this:\nPer-Day Traffic Summary\ndate          received  delivered   deferred    bounced     rejected\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nNov 30 2014         6          6 \nDec  1 2014        36         34         10         13          3 \nDec  2 2014        24         20         11         21          2 \nDec  3 2014        34         13         65         20         16 \nDec  4 2014        15         11         59         18         11 \n\nSo, here's the catch.. What deferred means? also bounced and rejected is related to sent emails? I'm thinking there may be a process sending spam somewhere..\nAny ways to see what emails are being sent?\nThanks!\n\nA: Deferred can be a status of an mail which is processed by your MTA and means that the mails are queued in your MTA. The mail could not be delivered, but it also is not rejected or bounced. This can happens if your MTA tries to send mails to a server who is not accessible via SMTP. You can display all queued mails with the command:\n    mailq\n\nIt also displays the sender and the recipient of the queued mails.\nNormally the Mail is re-queued (tried to send again) automatically after a while, but you can also re-queue it manually with the command:\n    postsuper -r ALL\n\nIf you want to delete all as deferred queued mails you can use the command:\n    postsuper -d ALL deferred\n\nI hope this was helpful Ulli\n", "Q: Upgrading Linux Kernel 3.11 to 3.13 for Ubuntu 14.04 When I upgraded to Ubuntu 14.04, apparently my kernel was supposed to upgrade from 3.11 to 3.13.

I just wanted to test a new option, that's all.\n\nA: The latest version of uGet has cURL multi-connections built in without the need of a plugin.\nhttp://uGetdm.com/\nI know you are already aware of uGet as you stated in your question but not sure if you're aware of the latest version new cURL features.\n\nA: To get a multi-threaded downloader which integrates with FlashGot, you can install uget and aria2\nsudo apt-get install uget aria2\n\nThen, go to uGet's settings and enable the aria2 plugin.\nuGet will also show up on FlashGot's list, where it can be selected for browser integration.\n", "Q: Cannot delete a folder I have Segate backup + 1TB external HDD recently since 1 month i am unable to copy the files effectively sometimes the copying is 10 kb/s like that. and sometimes iam getting error like  Input/output error & Error splicing file: Input/output error\n and when i check my External HDD with disk utility i had found\nDisk is OK, 438 bad sectors (37° C / 99° F)\n\nand i tried checking with  sudo smartctl --all /dev/sdb\nSMART overall-health self-assessment test result: PASSED\n\nand every other files i am able accessing all are good but iam unable to store the files its very hard to coping the files and i have one folder when i tried to delete using inodes, and rm-rf, and manual shift-delete iam getting error like Error removing file: No such file or directory but actually i am seeing that directory.\nplease tell is there any solution how to fix those bad blocks?\nAnd i had removed my HDD without safely remove drive or ejecting so many times.is any problem caused because of this?\nIs it a hardware problem or Filesystem problem ? can i use my HDD further without copying and deleting To save MY DATA until i get another NEW DISK?\n\nA: Your problem is likely a combination of hardware issues and damaged directory structures from not ejecting the disk properly. If Disk Utility is unable to repair any filesystem damage, replacing the disk is the best option. Quit using the disk until you have a replacement. Recover the data you can to the new drive. You may be able to get some additional life out of the old drive with a full erase & reformat which will map out bad blocks, but I would hesitate using it for any critical data storage.\n", "Q: Installing firmware-b43-installer in terminal, get E: Could not get lock /var/lib/dpkg/lock I am getting the following error message.

Or would I have to compile the kernel in order to apply these changes?\n\nA: You have to compile the kernel. The /boot/config-3.13.0-37-generic is simply the kernel config file at the time of compilation; it is there so that you know what has been compiled into your kernel and as a starting point for your own compilations. \nIt's not so difficult to do it --- the worst part of kernel compiling is the configuration; there are literally thousands of options. \nBeen there, done that; trying to stay away unless really needed...\n", "Q: Running service spacenavd start not same as /etc/init.d/spacenavd start I have an application which makes use of a 3dconnexion space mouse.

I have tried this solution but I don't have the GoogleTalkPlugin in the mentioned path.\nHow can I fix the Hangouts video or all the videos in general?\n\nA: Regarding fixing inverted/flipped laptop webcam video in Chrome/Chromium based browsers - V4L1 will not work with Chrome. V4L2 is needed for WebRTC video.\nA few days ago I updated ASUS P52F laptop to Linux Mint 18 XFCE that is on par with Ubuntu 16.04.1 now. I faced \"upside down\" webcam video on hangouts and facebook using Chrome web browser only. Firefox works fine. Cheese also displays video properly. \nAfter some googling I found this bug report. In the comment 22 you can see that 2 years ago there was a 0001-Use-libv4l2-for-Linux-V4L-grabber.patch proposed that fixes Chrome/Chromium behavior. For more then a year now libv4l2 is added to Chromium, but is not enabled for Linux. You can see the whole discussion in the bug report thread. Long story short it looks like they are not actively working on fixing this for almost a year now. However, there is some ugly workaround...\nYou can add Flip this extension to Chrome. It allows you to flip your webcam video or any other element of a webpage. It will flip it only locally, so people who you talk to via Chrome also need to use the same trick. It's not pretty, but it's working... well, kind of ; ) \nAfter all switching to Firefox may be a better and more comfortable solution as it looks like webcam video can't be permanently flipped \"upside down\" with Chrome until Google fix their Linux version. Firefox worked for me in LM18 without any additional hassle. I hope it will work for you as well.\n\nA: PS. If you still experience \"upside down\" video, even in Firefox, then the solution with GoogleTalkPlugin should work. You need to install it first (only Firefox still uses this plugin, Chrome has already switched to WebRTC video standard - no plugins needed there):\nLD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libv4l/v4l1compat.so /opt/google/talkplugin/GoogleTalkPlugin & firefox\n\nAlso check out this newer thread with more examples on how to use LD_PRELOAD in Ubuntu 16.04 and derivatives.

I can only choose to use the mod1 (Alt).\nI've tried reinstalling i3, and deleting the configure file to create a new one, without any good results. I really want to use Super because using Alt often conflicts with other program's short cuts.\nAnyone else had this problem or have any suggestions on how I can fix this. I've used i3wm before with Ubuntu 12.04 LTS without any problems whatsoever.\n\nA: Run xev and whenever you press the super key you should see something like this:\nKeyPress event ...\n    root 0x25, subw 0x0, ...\n    state 0x0, keycode 89 (keysym 0xffeb, Super_L), same_screen YES,\n    ...\n\nIf this doesn't work I can't help you. If it does then just note the description of the key just after the keysym. It's Super_L in this example but it might be something else in your case. Now execute these commands:\nxmodmap -e \"clear mod4\"\nxmodmap -e \"add Mod4 = Super_L\"\n\n*ATTENTION: make sure you replace Super_L with the description that xev prints to you in the above commands *\nThe curious can also run xmodmap -pm|grep mod4 in the end which should show mod4    Super_L\n\nA: If xev isn't displaying anything when you press the key, make sure your keyboard isn't in a \"gaming mode\". I ran into this with a Logitech G710+. The button to toggle the mode looks like a little joystick and apparently one thing it does is disable the \"Windows key\". I assume it's to keep you from being pulled out of a full screen game if you miss pressing CTRL or ALT.\n\nA: I've got this issue on Ubuntu 18.04, where apparently my device has Fn + Super mapped to disable the super key. During this state, the Super key didn't work, and I couldn't switch to any of my tags (I'm using dwm).

I'd like to be able to launch a video player (VLC, SMPlayer) via Terminal, using some command like resume_media and then it will automatically find the most recently played media file (.mkv, mp4 etc.) in a folder and resume the playback from where it was stopped.\nHow can I achieve this?\n\nA: If you have Zeitgeist daemon running on your system, it should save some helpful info to ~/.local/share/recently-used.xbel file. Zeitgeist monitors access to files on disk, so it should know your most recently played video file. Unfortunately the files are not sorted by file access, but the database contains that information too, so you can grep all data you need and then look for most recently file in a loop.\nI just wrote a Bash script to find the most recently played file with \"video/*\" MIME type and play it using SMPlayer (but you can use any video player, of course).\n#!/bin/bash\n\ndate_recent=\"\"\nfile_name=\"\"\n# get list of files with MIME type \"video/*\"\nvideo_files_list=$(grep -B3 \"<mime:mime-type type=\\\"video/\" ~/.local/share/recently-used.xbel | grep \"modified=\")\n\nwhile read -r line\ndo\n    # extract modification time (last access to file)\n    date_line=$(echo \"$line\" | cut -d'\"' -f6)\n    if [ \"$date_recent\" \\< \"$date_line\" ]\n    then\n        date_recent=$date_line  \n        file_name=$(echo \"$line\" | cut -d'\"' -f2)\n    fi\ndone <<< \"$video_files_list\"\n\n# file name is encoded like URL, use Python to decode it\nfile_name=$(python -c \"import sys, urllib as ul; print ul.unquote_plus(\\\"$file_name\\\")\")\n\n# play video\nsmplayer \"$file_name\"\n\nSave it to file, add permission to execute and it should work.\n", "Q: Boot for USB to fix file permissions I will start from the beginning.\nI was a noob and ran a really bad command in Ubuntu and now I can't do anything with sudo.\nI ran:\nsudo chmod 644 /\n\nI was instructed to boot from a liveCD or liveUSB.

My best guess is because I am changing the permissions on the root directory of the USB and not the root directory of my laptop.\nWhat am I missing here? How can I fix this?\n\nA: You are right, if you did that, you changed the mode of / of the live-system, but you want to change the mode of / of your root-partition on your hard-disk, so you first need to mount your hard-disk. \nAssuming your root-partition is /dev/sda2, enter\nmount /dev/sda2 /mnt\n\nto mount your root-partition to /mnt.

I can use proxies to get out to the Internet.\nHow do I configure Juju to use a restricted network?\n\nA: The error message for this problem was correct, the server was in restricted network and did not have access to the Internet.  The lab has a proxy server for http and https traffic.   \nThe solution was to export http_proxy, https_proxy, and no_proxy environment variables on the Juju host server:  \nexport http_proxy=http://squid.internal:3128\nexport https_proxy=https://squid.internal:3128\nexport no_proxy=localhost,127.0.0.1,10.0.3.1\n\nAfter setting these environment variables the server was able to contact the charm store over port 443 and the charm deployed successfully. \nThe no_proxy variable was used to exclude servers from the proxy.

It occurred to me that the windowlist, called by the command wmcrl -l, is  ordered by the age of the windows. By making the xfce panel do the same (settings), both orders are corresponding perfectly. What the script does is creating a window list, filtering out the \"real\", visible windows (with xprop) and switch to a chosen window by the command panel_navigate, with the number of the window (from the left to the right) as an agrument.\nIssues\nI noticed one exception: the IDLE (python interpreter) windows have pid 0 and their properties can not be \"researched\" by xprop. The windows do not appear in the windowlist and are skipped by the script.\nNote\nAlthough the Key combination Ctrl+<number> didn't raise any errors while testing, it might conflict with some applications. It might be safer to choose (e.g.) \nCtrl+Alt+1\n\nA: Not sure for the same application, but in Unity you can switch applications with super+number, as for example, super + 1 = first item on the launcher, super + 2 = the second item of the launcher, super + n = the nth item of the launcher. This also helps to open any item placed on the launcher, like if nautilus is the first item of the launcher, super + 1 will open up nautilus file manager.\n", "Q: How to setup Ubuntu router with 2 WAN interfaces I have an ubuntu router with Ubuntu server 14.04 installed.\nPhysical network interfaces are:\neth0 - local LAN\neth3 - WAN (internet)\nwlan2 - local wireless LAN (AP)\nThis is my /etc/network/interfaces:\n# The loopback network interface\nauto lo\niface lo inet loopback\n\n# LAN interface\nauto eth0\niface eth0 inet manual\n\n# This is the Wireless section.\nauto wlan2\niface wlan2 inet manual\n up /sbin/ifconfig wlan0 up\n\n# This is the Bridge section.\nauto br0\niface br0 inet static\naddress 192.168.2.106\nnetwork 192.168.2.0\nnetmask 255.255.255.0\nbridge_ports eth0 wlan0\n\n# WAN network interface (NAT-ed)\nauto eth3\niface eth3 inet static\naddress 192.168.1.1\nnetmask 255.255.255.0\ngateway 192.168.1.20\ndns-nameservers 8.8.8.8 4.4.4.4\n\nRoute is:\nKernel IP routing table\nDestination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags Metric Ref    Use Iface\ndefault         192.168.1.20    0.0.0.0         UG    0      0        0 eth3\n192.168.1.0     *               255.255.255.0   U     0      0        0 eth3\n192.168.2.0     *               255.255.255.0   U     0      0        0 br0\n\nI use UFW and this is what I have added to /etc/ufw/before.rules:\n# Configure NAT settings\n*nat\n:POSTROUTING ACCEPT [0:0]\n-A POSTROUTING -s 192.168.2.0/24 -o eth3 -j MASQUERADE\nCOMMIT\n\nUFW's status:\nStatus: active\n\nTo                         Action      From\n--                         ------      ----\n22                         ALLOW       Anywhere\n80                         ALLOW       Anywhere\n443                        ALLOW       Anywhere\nAnywhere                   ALLOW       192.168.2.0/24\n22 (v6)                    ALLOW       Anywhere (v6)\n80 (v6)                    ALLOW       Anywhere (v6)\n443 (v6)                   ALLOW       Anywhere (v6)\n\nThen I use also hostapd for wifi AP.

I have additional internet connection with a public ip which I want to use only for accessing the server(router) from outside (ssh, http, https). The public IP internet connection would be connected to the eth2.\nI do not know how to configure that. When I just enter this configuration into /etc/network/interfaces, I can't access the server (ssh,http,https) via a public IP specified for eth2.

What worries me, that since I configured this, I have no access to the server via public IP from the LAN behind the router. I think this is because of masquerading is set in a way we route everything from LAN behing the router via eth3 - which is a WAN interface eht3 (without a public IP). Am I right? Is there a way how to fix this?\n\nA: Solved completely\nNow I have the correct settings and whole setup is working, so I can access the server from internet via a public IP (WAN1) and route LAN to the internet via WAN2 and still I can access the server via its public IP (WAN1) from LAN.\nThis is the routing which had to be configured to make it work in a way I had described before:\nip route del default table main\nip route add default via 192.168.1.20 dev eth3 table main\n\nip route add 217.XXX.XXX.160/27 dev eth2 src 217.XXX.XXX.185 table T1\nip route add default via 217.XXX.XXX.161 dev eth2 table T1\nip route add 192.168.2.0/24 dev br0 table T1\nip route add 192.168.1.0/24 dev eth3 table T1\nip route add 127.0.0.0/8 dev lo table T1\n\nip route add 192.168.1.0/24 dev eth3 src 192.168.1.1 table T2\nip route add default via 192.168.1.20 dev eth3 table T2\nip route add 192.168.2.0/24 dev br0 table T2\nip route add 217.XXX.XXX.160/27 dev eth2 table T2\nip route add 127.0.0.0/8 dev lo table T2\n\nip rule add from 217.XXX.XXX.185 table T1\nip rule add from 192.168.1.1 table T2\n\nThat's it.

I have 8GB of system memory and when the system starts using swap the whole system slows down a lot. I do have a SSD but that doesn't make matters better. I have changed the swap settings to 1 but that has no effect. I regularly kill gnome-shell off to be able to use the system. I came from Unity where system-ram was used quite heavily and swap was sometimes used as well. My solution was to up ram from 4GB to 8GB and to change to GNOME, but it seems I still have the same problem :-(\nAny ideas how to limit gnome-shell ram usage? Any program that can kill off gnome when it exceeds 4GB for example? I don't really know what to do except try Unity again or change to Xubuntu or such. I do really like GNOME though...\n\nA: gnome-shell leaks memory like a colander. \nThere is a bug reported here (it's for Mint but it's the same problem) and on redhat. \nUpstream there are at least 9 bugs reported. \nBasically (one developer told me once, I can't find the reference) gnome-shell is completely unable (by design) to control the memory usage of its extensions. Add this to the fact that there is no API documentation for writing them (at least, I could not find it when I wrote mine) and well... leak happens. \nIn my case, I had to remove a couple of extensions (sensors and weather were the main culprits) that made the shell grows like crazy. Even now, every now and then I have to restart the shell with Alt-F2 and r to get it back to its normal size (and then you have to cope with gnome-terminals going crazy...).  \nPractical solution: \n\n\n*\n\n*remove all extensions, look at the memory usage, and add them one by one to find the worst offender(s). \n\n*gnome-shell still leaks memory by itself, or you really need some extensions. So I do every now and then (basically every morning, my PC is normally on 24/7):\n\n*kill gnome terminals to avoid the bug above (in 14.04-shell 3.10; should be fixed in newer shell), by doing from one of them: \nkillall gnome-terminal \n\nand reset the shell with Alt-F2 and r\nPD: I know, there are others DEs.

However, you can still access the unity sidebar by pressing the Super key. \nwmctrl -r \":ACTIVE:\" -b toggle,fullscreen\n\nThis command toggles the current focused app between fullscreen mode and not. I then have this binded to F1 and use that to switch apps.\nYou may want to automate binding. Its possible through Compiz.\n\nA: There is no way to make it hide or auto-hide, as far as I know, but you could make it transparent and install the CompizConfig Settings Manager (CCSM):\nsudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager\nUnlike the launcher the top bar always stays visible and doesn't have an autohide option, but can be tweaked to at least be transparent.\nIf you want to at least make it transparent, once you install the CompizConfig Settings Manager search for it in the Dash and open it. Once opened, look for \"Ubuntu Unity Plugin\" (Under Desktop) and in there under General tab (the first tab that opens) look for Panel Opacity and lower down the setting to your liking.\nThe opacity settings go from 1.0000 (no transparency) to 0.000 (transparent) so there is a lot of room for fine tuning.

These plugins provide different features so you can pick which one you want...or you can choose an order to use the plugins.\nFor example, if one plugin is faster for you then you can use that one and if you attempt to do a feature that it doesnt support it will move onto the next plugin to accomplish the task.\n", "Q: How can I configure clipboard as Windows? Windows 7, XP... maintains the copy text if you close the application.\nHow could I configure Ubuntu for this behavior?\nThanks in advance!\n\nA: According to this wiki, whether the clipboard contents are remembered after the source application is closed depends on the application but several programs in X11-based operating systems do not ensure that the clipboard is remembered.\nThe user may want to install a clipboard manager to deal with this issue.

This is very easy to fix. Change your command to:\nsudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda bs=1024\n\nNow, run it. When it asks you for your password, enter it. You will not see characters\n\nGenerally, whenever you see Permission Denied, it means you need to do whatever it is you are trying to do as root. This does NOT mean you should put sudo before every command that results in Permission Denied. Instead, think of each Permission Denied message as this:\n\nHey! You! Yes, you. With the pants.

I am having a problem that I cannot browse the header files /libraries to  get the implementation of the C functions like mssget, msgsnd, shmat etc.\nHow should I open these files?\n\nA: If you are referring to the sys/msg.h header file specifically, then it should be provided by the libc6-dev development package\nFirst make sure that the package is installed, either via the Software Center application or from a terminal using\nsudo apt-get install libc6-dev\n\nafter which you should be able to browse the header file at\n/usr/include/i386-linux-gnu/sys/msg.h\n\n(for 32-bit systems) or\n/usr/include/x86_64-linux-gnu/sys/msg.h\n\n(for 64-bit systems).\n\nTo see the actual implementation of a library function, you will need to download the corresponding source code package: first, you will need to enable the relevant source repository (see How do I enable the source code repositories? if you don't know how to do that) and then, for example, in a directory of your choice\napt-get source libc6-dev\n\nwill download, unpack, and patch the source tarball into that directory (in this case, it will pick 'eglibc' as source package instead of 'libc6-dev').

When I press Ctrl+Shift+u and type numbers, nothing happens. Holding down Control or Shift doesn't help, either. \nI've tried running sudo dpkg-reconfigure keyboard-configuration, but that didn't solve the problem.\n\nA: It hasn't stopped working in general, but the way it works may have led you to think that it has stopped working. When one types Ctrl+Shift+u an underscored letter u appears at the insertion point. This may lead a person (e.g., myself, at first) to think that he has entered an underscored letter u, whereas in fact the underscored letter u indicates the Unicode-entry mode has been activated. If one subsequently keys in a Unicode code point (i.e., the hexadecimal numeral for the character) and hits Enter then the unicode character will appear.\nFor example, Ctrl+Shift+u 2764Enter inserts a \"heavy black heart\" Unicode character. \nDemonstration: ❤\n\nA: The reason why entering Ctrl+Shift+u, Unicode hexadecimal number, Enter or Space stop working in Ubuntu 15.10+ is because input method is by default XIM instead of iBus (which is odd since XIM is obsolete and iBus already implement XIM protocol). By changing this they broke this useful shortcut.\nTo fix it, go to:\n\n*\n\n*On GNOME Shell (17.10+, check with wmctrl -m):\nSettings → Region & Language → Manage Installed Languages → Language tab.\nOn Unity: System Settings... → Language Support.\n\n\n*Keyboard input method system, change it to iBus.\n\n\n\n*Restart\nReference\n\n*\n\n*gnome - Understanding & setting up different input methods - Unix & Linux Stack Exchange\n", "Q: 14.10 Dual Monitors are displayed as distorted single screen mode I have very recently updated my Ubuntu OS from 14.04 to 14.10.

You should probably fix the display issues first (could try booting with some of the troubleshooting-type kernel options from the grub (Ubuntu) menu, under \"F6 Other Options\" like nomodeset, noapic, acpi=off, etc? Often one or a combination of them get things going on older or odd hardware.\nOr you could try a different desktop environment (easier).\nYou could try a newer Lubuntu like 14.10, or try Xubuntu, regular Ubuntu (unity or gnome3).

Maybe wipefs didn't erase much, it says When used without options -a or -o, it lists all visible filesystems and the offsets of their signatures. Does running wifefs -n (the -n , --no-act to make sure nothing else gets erased accidentally) on the drive &/or each partition show anything?\nA big feature of raid is if you have a drive go bad you can swap it out without losing any data, but it sounds like you avoided that roadblock ;-)\nBut I have a suggestion on data recovery.\ntestdisk can sometimes recover from erased partition info or an erased MBR, but I don't think it can do the filesystem itself. But testdisk's application photorec does recover files/data, only without the filenames or directory structure. photorec is pretty easy to use, run as root, point it to a partition or whole drive, pick from a list of filetypes to recover, somewhere to store recovered files, and away it goes.\nAnd you'd need some space somewhere to store the recovered data without writing it back to the same drive (risking overwriting data yet to be recovered). There's plenty of places to get a few gigs of online storage free, but 4TB is a lot.

Probably at some point in time the proprietary technology gets licensed for other platforms and the \"customer experience\" gets ported.\nI don't want to sound like I'm ranting, but the choice of calling it 7.1 is so unbelievably ambiguous. I remember older 5.1 headsets being sold with 3 drivers per ear, which were technically 4.2 and upgrades to that would be 6.2 or 8.2, but if the driver or virtual speaker count doesn't matter why not just go ahead and call it Atmos Portable or Atmos Gaming?

After having hacker problems for about a year, I look at everything on my system and if it looks suspicious, I uninstall it. When I found the application, Access Prompt, on my system, I found that it is available from the download center, but I don't like it and I chose to uninstall the application. When I uninstall this app, the app for desktop access to the download center uninstalls with it. If I redownload the software center app, the Access Prompt app also installs even though I don't want it. This happens every time I try to get rid of the app, Access Prompt, and I have been trying to rid myself of this app for several weeks now. This is how the access prompt app gets past my firewall and onto my system, as I have it blocked. This app, as far as I can tell, does nothing but steal people's passwords, undermining their security. How can I get rid of this nightmare app, Access Prompt, and still be able to keep the application to download apps from the Ubuntu Software Centre? I think Canonical should check the Access Prompt app, as I tried to leave a review and of course leaving any kind of review is impossible as the review space is unavailable/not working. I appreciate any help anyone is willing to provide as this hacker has made me miserable for the past year and has also spread to my relative's operating systems before I was aware that he was in my system.\n\nA: Access Prompt is a security feature that is used when accessing your PC remotely or install or updating/upgrading either via Terminal or Unity/Nautilus/Gnome.  If it requires a password input from user, it'll bring either screens below up depending on how your input method is.\nAccess Prompt has many dependencies and is a dependant of other system processes.\nWhen we type in apt-cache depend gcr into a terminal we see we see what Access Prompt is dependency of:\n$ apt-cache depends gcr\ngcr\n  |Depends: dconf-gsettings-backend\n  Depends: <gsettings-backend>\n  dconf-gsettings-backend\n  Depends: libc6\n  Depends: libgcr-base-3-1\n  Depends: libgcr-ui-3-1\n  Depends: libglib2.0-0\n  Depends: libgtk-3-0\n  Depends: dbus-x11\n    dbus-x11:i386\n  Breaks: gnome-keyring\n  Breaks: gnome-keyring:i386\n  Replaces: gnome-keyring\n  Replaces: gnome-keyring:i386\n  Conflicts: gcr:i386\n\nWhen you use apt-cache rdepend gcr we find what processes Access Prompt or gcr needs to run\n$ apt-cache rdepends gcr\ngcr\nReverse Depends:\n  gnome-keyring\n  gcr:i386\n  ubuntu-gnome-desktop\n  seahorse\n  gnome-keyring\n\nTo further expand on Access Prompt, it also accesses Sudoers file list.  As it checks to see if your actually who you say you are.  The only one true way to remove this function is to simply root your Ubuntu Computer.  I would HIGHLY suggest against this.\nAccess Prompt is your last means of defense when it comes to protecting your goods on an unencrypted drive.  Your password prevents unauthorized use from people who want your goodies!\n\n\n\nA: Access prompt is an integral part of the operating system with which you grant programs the permission to install software or change your system. It is not a hacking tool and does not give your passwords away.\n", "Q: Utility for entering partitions into fstab Under Windows it's possible to create a symbolic name for a disk partition by assigning it a drive letter.  It's certainly possible to do that in (K)ubuntu by editing /etc/fstab and inserting the appropriate entry, but that's inelegant compared with the way it's done in Windows.  Is there a way to do the same with a higher-level utility such as the KDE Partition Manager?  The KDE Partition Manager does understand mount points but doesn't have a way of inserting them into fstab if they aren't already there, as far as I can tell.\nI asked this question a couple of years ago and didn't get any answers, but the situation may have improved since then.\n\nA: With GNOME Disks Utility:\n\nUsually, it will have Automatic Mount Options enabled.

Currently, my Windows is installed alongside Ubuntu (my primary OS). I was not aware that Borderlands 2 could be run on Ubuntu, and would like to play it there.\nIs there a way of moving the Windows files to a Ubuntu directory? Even if all the files won't work, are there some chunks I can get away with moving—then doing something like \"verify game files\" to patch up w/e else is needed?\n\nA: You cannot just copy installed files from Program files and start playing with wine. It wont work, wine will not be able to load all files and play.\nI try this on NFS:most wanted and counter strike 1.6. since these games of less size and graphics and didnt play well, new games of bigger size will also have same problem.\nIf you can install the game using setup with PlayonLinux you may be able to play it. what I mean is, you have to install the game again in ubuntu using playonlinux.\nSteam on the other hand is installable on linux since valve have made it available so\n", "Q: How to set static IP on ubuntu 14.04 I am using ubuntu 14.04 system.

Since I was dissatisfied with all the options presented, I wrote a script which does exactly what I want, using gphoto2 to access the camera and get files from it.  The one problem is that, even if I have specified 'do nothing' to the box, the camera remains mounted and thus, as far as gphoto2 is concerned, unavailable because not released.  In order to release it I must open or find a folder display, and specifically eject the camera.  I would rather not bother with this step and just let my script run.  I am wondering if there is a way to do this.\n\nA: For Ubuntu 17.10, 18.04, and up, you'll need to use the utility gio (which replaced gvfs-mount). \nIf the camera is mounted and you have gphoto2 installed, try\ngio mount -s gphoto2\n\nbut if you want to target the camera specifically:\ngio mount -l\n\nwill show you the mountable drives.\nIf you have a camera plugged in, it might look like this:\n$ gio mount -l\nDrive(0): DA4032\n  Type: GProxyDrive (GProxyVolumeMonitorUDisks2)\nVolume(0): Canon Digital Camera\n  Type: GProxyVolume (GProxyVolumeMonitorGPhoto2)\n  Mount(0): Canon Digital Camera -> gphoto2://%5Busb%3A002,002%5D/\n    Type: GProxyShadowMount (GProxyVolumeMonitorGPhoto2)\nMount(1): Canon Digital Camera -> gphoto2://%5Busb%3A002,002%5D/\n  Type: GDaemonMount\n\ncopying the location after the -> will allow you to unmount it via gio mount -u (unmount, if you look at the help: gio help mount\ngio mount -u gphoto2://%5Busb%3A002,002%5D/\n\nwill unmount the camera via shell. Now, to automate this, you'll need to create a systemd script. \n\nA: If you do not want to fiddle with udev (which is a system thing), you can use the udisk interface to unmount the camera. \nThe camera will normally mount at a fixed place, like /media/user/1234-5678/ or similar (YMMV, depends on how the camera formats the card); and as a device, say /dev/sdc1/. \nNow, you can unmount it from your script using \n udisksctl unmount -b /dev/sdc1\n\nthe problem is that the device can change; my solution is having this little magic \n udisksctl unmount -b $(mount | grep 1234-5678  | cut -d\" \"  -f1)\n\nwhich will work provided that the card id doesn't change.\n", "Q: Grub starts on bootup on USB Flash Drive I installed Ubuntu 14.04 to a 64gb USB Flash drive so I have my desktop and apps wherever I go.

Main concern should be your video card and your internet connection. If needed for your system check that wireless works. If your display acts up while installing using it will become problematic and fixing a problem nearly impossible for a new user. If you depend on wireless it will be hard to get something fixed.

You need to take that literal: \".jpg\" is NOT \".JPG\" or \".jPg\" or any other combination. Windows is different in that way: it will see those as the same.\nIn the same directory do an ls and it will show contents of that directory. ls *jpg to list all files ending on *.jpg.\nMind that -R means recursive BUT that applies to directories only when copy-ing. It does not mean it will get you all files in all directories that have a file ending in *.jpg.  \nIf you want to find all files ending in *.jpg and copy them over to /test1/ this will work:\nfind . -depth -name '*.jpg' -print | cpio -pmdv /test1/\n\nAdd a ~ to /test1/ if it is in your home directory.\n\nwhere test1 has already been created under MikeO\n\nWhat do you mean with this?

The sensors are less accurate for lower temperatures.\nPsensor is using the lm-sensor lib to retrieve the AMD CPU temperature. \nBTW, if the BIOS is reporting a different temperature, it should indicate an issue on lm-sensor side or the need of a specific configuration for your MB/CPU.\nYou should probably get in touch with the lm-sensor dev and ask them some guidance. You can find contact information at: http://lm-sensors.org/wiki/FeedbackAndSupport\n\nA: Same for me. But only the temp for cpu is odd: psensor shows 15C, while the bios shows 35C.

Both of host OS and container have nginx 1.4.6 installed.\nContainer has ip-address 10.0.3.100 and located in /home/romka/.local/share/lxc/php55/rootfs/ (it's a unprivileged container).\nNginx in host OS has following configuration:\n\nupstream php55 {\n        server  10.0.3.100;\n}\n\nserver {\n        # some not important directives are skipped\n\n        # serve non static request\n        location / {\n            proxy_pass          http://php55/;\n            proxy_set_header    X-Real-IP       $remote_addr;\n            proxy_set_header    Remote-Addr     $remote_addr;\n            proxy_set_header    X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;\n            proxy_set_header    Host            $host;\n        }\n\n        # process static request\n        location ~* ^.+\\.(ico|jpg|jpeg|gif|png|zip|tgz|gz|rar|bz2|doc|xls|exe|pdf|ppt|txt|tar|mid|midi|wav|bmp|rtf|swf|flv|htc|js|css)$ {\n            root /home/romka/.local/share/lxc/php55/rootfs/var/www/do.kece.ru/;\n        }\n\n        # some not important directives are skipped\n}\n\nThis config means that requests to php-scripts are passed to nginx inside the container. Requests to static files should be processed by nginx in host OS.\nRequests to php-files are correctly passes to container, but requests to static files are return error \"403 Forbidden\" and in logfile on host OS I see line:\n\n2014/12/06 15:56:40 [error] 966#0: *9 open() \"/home/romka/.local/share/lxc/php55/rootfs/var/www/do.kece.ru/1.txt\" failed (13: Permission denied), client: 84.23.63.51, server: do.kece.ru, request: \"GET /1.txt HTTP/1.1\", host: \"do.kece.ru\"\n\nInside the container nginx works on behalf of user and group www-data:www-data with uid:gid - 33:33,  inside host OS nginx works on behalf of the same user with uid:gid - 100033:100033.

And what can I do to solve the problem?\n\nA: What I think the issue is is that a parent directory is blocking the permission to the LXC rootfs. So you should move the /var/www directory in the container to /var/local/www/ in the host, then bind mount it into the container and change your host nginx config to point to that new location.\nIn the host run:\ninstall -m 750 -o 100000 -g www-data -d /var/local/www/\ncp -R /home/romka/.local/share/lxc/php55/rootfs/var/www/ /var/local/www\nrm -rf /home/romka/.local/share/lxc/php55/rootfs/var/www/\n\nThen edit your container config to add the line\nlxc.mount.entry=/var/local/www /home/romka/.local/share/lxc/php55/rootfs/var/www none bind 0 0\n\nThen finally change your nginx config to point to /var/local/www for the static stuff.\n", "Q: Compiz or Unity not working After upgrading to the latest Nvidia Driver 340.58 the Ubuntu Desktop is not working.

Pretty much you enter the data into the HTML form which is then sent to the server. The server analyses the data to see if it's legitimate and then performs an action based upon it.

Sometimes Ubuntu issues sounds for certain events. For example, when a user logs out, Ubuntu plays a short drum beat snippet.\nThese \"sounds\" are nice quality. But I need a \"soundless\" sound profile to prevent any noise when I operate in quiet environments. How can I prevent Ubuntu from issuing any sounds? With Microsoft Windows, I can just select a \"No Sound\" profile.\nI tried Sound > Sound Effects > Alert Volume = Mute. but this does nothing.\n\nA: To mute the Alert Sounds along with the login/logout sounds:\n\nUsing Ubuntu Tweak\nInstall Ubuntu Tweak\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-tweak\nOnce installed, launch it and select Tweaks, then Sounds to make your selections:\n\n\n\nWithout using Ubuntu Tweak\nOpen the Sound Menu in System\n\n\n\nThis will diasable the Alert Sounds. To also disable the login sound we first have to make Gnome Login Sound visable in startup Applications. To do this, open a terminal (Ctrl-Alt-T) and enter:\nsudo gedit /usr/share/gnome/autostart/libcanberra-login-sound.desktop\nIn the gedit window that opens, change the line that reads \"NoDisplay=true\" to \"NoDisplay=false\".\n\nOpen your Startup Applications through the Dash and then make sure Gnome Login Sound is unslected:\n\n\nNote: Disabling Gnome Login Sounds does not work for later versions of Ubuntu. For that you can disable the login sounds by Muting the sound at the login screen. However, sometimes this transfers over to the user making you have to un-mute when logged in. But it will stick in the login screen.*\n\nA: On Ubuntu 14.04, running this command solved it for me instantly:\ndconf write /org/gnome/desktop/sound/event-sounds false\n\n\nA: Like you I like a silent computer & I dislike the Ubuntu drum sound on start-up & reboot.\nMy solution to silence my computer was to get an old set of headphones, or ones that no longer work, and cut off the cord at the headphone jack and place the remaining headphone jack in the headphone socket on the computer. When you want to listen to sounds take out the silencing headphone jack.\nIt's crude and a software/system setting solution would be better, but it works!\n\nA: The Sound Preferences dialog is a bit mysterious since not everything has an obvious effect.\nThere are, however, a couple of things that seem to be useful here:\n\n\n*\n\n*Set the \"Sound theme\" to \"No sounds\"\n\n*Disable the checkbox for \"Enable window and button sounds\"\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the dialog in Ubuntu MATE: System->Preferences->Sound\n\n*Open the dialog from the MATE command line: mate-volume-control\n\n*Just guessing, but this might be gnome-volume-control when not using MATE desktop\n\n\n\n\nA: Another way is to get rid of the ogg file itself. Go to /usr/share/sounds/ubuntu/stereo and replace the system-ready.ogg file with a silence.ogg file which you can shorten with Audacity.\n\nA: In Ubuntu 20.04 what I did to resolve this issue is:\n❯ cd /usr/share/sounds/Yaru/stereo\n❯ sudo mv power-unplug.oga power-unplug.oga_removed\n❯ sudo mv power-plug.oga power-plug.oga_removed\n\nThis is the only solution that worked for me\n\nA: Sometimes Ubuntu sound configuration just not working...\nFor example the alert sound is too noisy and annoying and sometimes it makes error or occurs lagging but whatever I changing in sound setting, it never works.\nIf you want to turn off completely every sound from Ubuntu than you can just remove pulseaudio.\nsudo apt purge pulseaudio\n\nAnd if you want to turn on sound later, than just reinstall the pulseaudio.\nsudo apt install pulseaudio\n\n", "Q: Why is there a one-second timestamp difference on copy?

For a complete picture see How to understand the Ubuntu file system layout? Directories you will need are /bin/, /sbin/, /usr/, /etc/, /var/ , /lib/, /home/, /opt/ (3rd party software goes to /opt/; might be empty). /boot/ might be needed too depending on what you install.\nI would reconsider if I was you. Your approach is pretty Windows oriented. The directories you need are almost all of them. And there are better methods. \n\n\nBackup of your installed software after installing Ubuntu\n\nThere is a method you might like: /var/cache/apt/archives/ holds all the installer files you need if you want to restore your system. If you back that up and re-install Ubuntu you can copy them back to /var/cache/apt/archive and can use the dpkg command to restore them. That would require you to backup that directory and your /home/ (all settings are there). This might be a good option to restore a system with a re-install and after installing a manual update of those packages and a restore of your /home/.\n\n\nFull system backup\n\nIf you want to do this a full system backup is the best option. It would stop you from picking directories and the directories you do not nee is marginal at best. You can even automatic this with an rsync backup where the system only copies what got changed.  Saves a lot of disk space. Have a look at ...\n\n\n*\n\n*Backup your home directory with rsync and skip useless folders\nA full system backup is a good method in case your hardware is going to act up. Think bad sectors, crashes due to hardware failure. Upgrading to a new release that might fail. Or to copy your system over to a new harddisk, or new system. We are talking about some of the bigger problems computers can have or software can cause. \nIt also guarantees you backup everything. So if there is some obscure directory we know nothing about that you would have liked to see a backup of this makes sure it will be there on the backup.\n\n\nSingle file backup\n\nIn case of you wanting to save yourself from yourself a full system backup is overkill. If the main concern is editing files that might go wrong and you effectively kill your system yourself the best approach is to create a backup of the file you want to edit. Let's assume you want to manually edit a file called \"test\". A simple...\ncp file.txt file_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).txt\n\nwill create a file with the date with seconds include. \ncp test.txt test_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).txt\n~/Downloads$ ls test*\ntest_20141207_171058.txt\ntest.txt\n\nThis will be more than enough to keep your system from breaking down by your own hands. Normally you can still boot and restore your file but if needed you can also use a live dvd to just copy the file back over the original file with...\ncp test_20141207_171058.txt test.txt\n\nare restore your system to a working one. \nIf you keep forgetting to make backups: Gedit is capable of making automated backups (it adds \"~\" at the end of the file before you save the changed one).\n\nA: We can also use a software called TimeShift to backup installed software.\nBy default this software does not backups your home directory\n", "Q: How to make ts include year in prepended date? ts can be used to prepend time to a line of text:\n$ echo \"foo bar test\" | ts\nDec 06 12:42:16 foo bar test\n\nI want to obtain this exact time format, but including the year,\n2014 Dec 06 12:42:16 foo bar test\n\nHow can I do this?\n\nA: From the manpage:\n   The optional format parameter controls how the timestamp is formatted,\n   as used by strftime(3). The default format is \"%b %d %H:%M:%S\". In\n   addition to the regular strftime conversion specifications, \"%.S\" and\n   \"%.s\" are like \"%S\" and \"%s\", but provide subsecond resolution (ie,\n   \"30.00001\" and \"1301682593.00001\").\n\nFor example:\n$ echo a  | ts '%F %T'\n2014-12-06 23:16:02 a\n\nFor the particular format requested:\n$ echo a  | ts '%Y %h %d %H:%M:%S'\n2014 Dec 06 23:17:40 a\n\nConsult man strftime for the various format specifiers available.\n", "Q: How to add Windows 7 to an encrypted Ubuntu installation I'm trying to partition my hard drive on Ubuntu 14.04 - I installed the OS about a week ago and wanted to go ahead and get a dual boot OS of Windows 7. I was looking to partition the hard drive but just was looking for some guidance on using fdisk/gparted because I don't quite understand what disk space would be safe to partition. Here is some relevant output from pydf:\nFilesystem           Size Used Avail Use%              Mounted on\n/dev/ubuntu--vg/root 216G  11G  194G  5.3 [#.........] /         \n/dev/sda1            235M  84M  139M 35.6 [####......] /boot \n\nSo it would seem that I should only not touch sda1 since it's booted, right? And then, I'm really not sure why this output doesn't correspond to fdisk's output here:\nDevice Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System\n/dev/sda1   *        2048      499711      248832   83  Linux\n/dev/sda2          501758   468860927   234179585    5  Extended\n/dev/sda5          501760   468860927   234179584   83  Linux\n\nHow is sda2 and sda5 represented in terms of usage? Also, sda1 seems to compose most of my hard drive in terms of fdisk I think? (240GB SSD) Yet, sda2 and sda5 seem to be orders of magnitude larger?

Any Microsoft OS must be installed on the first primary partition of the hard drive and that partition must be made bootable. (that's what you get from a monopoly: you can dictate what you want and it has been like this since MS-DOS 1.0)\nSo basically, you've backed yourself into a corner as the first primary partition (sda1) is a Linux partition (ext4 probably, not visible from the output you've provided) and Microsoft will not like that...\nTo complicate things further, you have no spare partitions and your extended partition (sda2) only contains one partition (sda5) containing all of Ubuntu (system and data but not the boot) which is fully encrypted (which nor Microsoft nor the Ubuntu Live CD like either).\nThe easiest for you to do is buy an additional hard drive, set that as the primary hard drive in your BIOS and install Windows on there. To switch to Ubuntu, you'll have to go into the BIOS and boot from your secondary hard drive. (Windows cannot be booted from a secondary hard drive)\nThe more complicated solution is to unencrypt sda5, back up your entire hard drive using something like CloneZilla Disk-to-image, boot Windows from CD, wipe all partitions using the Windows boot loader, create whatever Windows partitions you want and then boot with the Ubuntu Live CD you used for installing your OS a week ago, install it again using the same partitioning scheme you used a week ago (minus the space you allocated to Windows). \nYou now have a grub2 system allowing you to boot into both OSes.  \nOnly now can you restore the images from your backup into the newly created Linux partitions effectively restoring your work of the entire week...\nThese new partitions will have different partition numbers though so the sda1 of your backup will have to be restored in sda2 or sda3 or so depending on your new install and sda5 into whatever first partition of your extended partition you now have created...\nNow you're finally ready to reboot and boot into your restored Ubuntu partitions from a week ago.  The only thing left now is to re-encrypt your non-boot Ubuntu partition...\nThere is an even smarter solution that I can see but that is the really complicated solution so drop a comment if you're interested in that one! (No, no additional HD necessary)\n", "Q: Enable a window without titlebar in all workspaces I have a window (Google Hangouts App, to be precise) that I want to show up on all my workspaces.

I am tryint to install Matlab R2014b. I followed these steps, based on this tutorial:\n\n\n*\n\n*Mounted the .iso file\n\n*cd /media/username/MATHWORKS_R2014B\n\n*sudo ./install (installed in /usr/local/MATLAB/R2014b)\n\n*sudo apt-get install matlab-support\n\n*cd ~ sudo chown username -R ~/.matlab\nDuring step 4 the window which required activation appeared several times and when I had to give the usrrname the default was always root and I never changed that, but when I try to run it, the activation window appears again but this time with username instead of root and it gives me the following error:\nCould not complete Activation because the License File could not be written to disk.  You might not have write permission on the License File or the folder. /home/username/.matlab/R2014b_licenses/license_username_836966_R2014b.lic  See your System Administrator for assistance. The specific error message text is: /home/username/.matlab/R2014b_licenses/license_username_836966_R2014b.lic (No such file or directory).\nI googled this error and after some results I performed the following steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*cd /usr/local/MATLAB/R2014b/bin/glnxa64\nsudo ./activate_matlab.sh\n\n*sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/MATLAB/R2014b/licenses\nsudo chmod a+rw /usr/local/MATLAB/R2014b/licenses\nBut still the same thing happens. And the problem is that in the ./matlab folder I don't have the license file they are asking me for. And when I try to download it from the MathWorks account I can only save it as licence.lic which is different than the name they are asking me for and which cannot be saved in the /usr/local/MATLAB/R20194b folder.\nHow can I solve this problem?\n\nA: OK, so you have two users: one called \"root\" (big no-no, but anyway, that's what you have) and one called \"username\"…\nThen the command is\ncp /root/.matlab/* /home/username/.matlab/\n\n\nA: For those installing higher versions of matlab. The \n./activate_matlab.sh\n\nis rather located in the bin directory. So\ncd /usr/local/MATLAB/R2014b/bin/ \n\nThen \nsudo ./activate_matlab.sh./\n\nShould do the magic.\n", "Q: how do i get latest skype on my machine?

You can install lm-sensors / gkrellm for a real-time temp. display to check - or you could just try blowing out the fan vents or a laptop cooler, if you have one - assuming it's not a new laptop (in which cae, consider warranty..). 4 hours seems a long time for a software fault, especially if it's repeatable.

Insert the Windows DVD and reboot your computer and press the one of these keys: F1, F2, F8, F10 or DEL. Then you get to the BIOS and EFI and you can configure your BIOS to boot from DVD or directly select you DVD-Drive to boot.

If a package is present in the ubuntu repository (the one at archive.ubuntu.com), can I expect that the same package (or later versions of the package) will always be present in the repo in future versions of Ubuntu? What is the policy on removing packages from the repository from one version to the next? Is the policy different for the different sections of the repository (main, universe, multiverse, etc.)?\n\nA: No you can't be sure. You may always be able to download and backup a specific version of a software to install on further release if its get kicked from the repositories. But I strongly recommend you not to do this. Software updates and upgrades for ubuntu are well tested and should not cause problems. Of course there is no guaranty. If software packages are updated and upgraded, the are for a good reason (security issues, legacy software etc.) and you should install them. \nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/StableReleaseUpdates\n\nA: Most programs/application are normally brought forward. But there are exceptions: \n\n\n*\n\n*A program is not maintained any more, and there are doubt about its security. One example is DenyHost.\n\n*A program does not compile anymore with newer libraries, and the old libraries have been dropped for lack of maintenance. This is the case of pdfedit, for example. \n\n*A program still compiles, is available, but does not work correctly with the new version of libraries and there is no maintainer/sufficient interest to fix it, like the case of xfig. \nIn case 1, the best thing to do is to go forward --- an insecure program is insecure, full stop. \nIn the other cases, a workaround is nice to have. In the linked posts there are the specific ones; I asked for a more general one here. \n", "Q: firefox-wget-window doesnt close after download I use Firefox with flashgot, which makes downloads via wget.\nSome time ago, the wget-terminal-window appears, makes its download, and when finished correctly it disappears automatically.\nThen there was an update... and now the wget-terminal-window does not disappear on its own.

I am currently running KDE on my laptop and I would like to know if there is something with the same capabilities of krunner for unity DE. What I really need is a good file index capability plus application control, just like krunner. I know the dash can look similar but due to Zeitgeist it does not is useful to me, and moreover it is damn slower than krunner.

Your script should look like this:\n#!/bin/sh\njava -Xmx1024M -jar craftbukkit.jar -o true\n\nHere's a breakdown of what each line of the script does:\n#!/bin/sh\n\nThis line causes your script to be invoked by /bin/sh, which is (in the case) the bash shell\njava -Xmx1024M -jar craftbukkit.jar -o true\n\nThis line actually starts the server (craftbukkit.jar must be in the same directory.\n-Xmx1024M sets the maximum amount of memory available to the process to 1GB, or 1024 MB.

However it has been \"installing the upgrades\" for over 70 hours. Yes, over three days. My system is almost frozen and it seems( I can't check) that it is eating most of my CPU but as it is frozen I can't check. \nHow much longer should I wait for it and can I cancel at this stage? If I can, how and if I can't, how long will it take? I am quite worried.\nEDIT: solved thanks to the_Seppi. I am very grateful.\n\nA: It really shouldn't take this long. I assume something went wrong and it's unlikely that further waiting will be of any use. Most likely your system didn't survive the presumably failed release upgrade and only a new installation might be able to get a fully working system again.\nSo the steps that seem apt now are these:\n\n\n*\n\n*Cancel the upgrade (If necessary using the power button)\n\n*Create a bootable USB stick or DVD with a 14.04 ISO from within your Windows.\n\n*Install 14.04 from the USB stick. Do not select the upgrade method, but go the Something Else route.\n\n*Delete the Ubuntu partition, if you indeed don't have any personal files on it.\n\n*Create a new EXT4 partition in the now free space. Select it for the installation of the system.\n\n*Select sda for the boot loader, if you're using legacy BIOS or your EFI partiton (probably sda1), if you're running an UEFI system.\n\n*Start the installation.\n\n\nIf you want to go through a release upgrade again in the future (a full reinstallation gives you a clean system without any remains of the previous onw), you may want to run it from a terminal or TTY with the command do-release-upgrade. In doing so, you'll see everything that is done, and you will also know about any errors that occur.\n\nA: If it helps user2904527, Mine took about 12 hours to do the same.\nIt could you either your\n1) Internet connection or \n2) No. of packages you have, that needs to be upgraded.\nEasier option is to backup your data & Use Ubuntu 14 Installer from USB/CD....\n", "Q: Ubuntu Terminal, what is its executable name?

I've tried a few different flavors of Linux on it before settling on Lubuntu. The only problem? I can't get any sound out from the system whatsoever.\nI've tried both Lubuntu 14.10, and Lubuntu 14.04. I was able to get the audio working (albeit crackling) when I had Ubuntu 14.04 and Ubuntu 14.10 installed. However, since both had more processing overhead and more features than I was going to use, I stepped down to Lubuntu.\nAs the header says, I'm running my audio to my TV via HDMI, but I'm getting absolutely nothing out of it. When I run alsamixer, it identifies my card as \"HD-Audio Generic\", and my chip as \"ATI R6xx HDMI\". I know the ID for the device is 0,3, but that doesn't do me much good since I'm not much of a Linux power user.\nDoes anyone have any ideas to help me out? I've been working on it all week and it's driving me nuts. :/\nAfter a little bit more testing, it appears no audio is working on the system at all. I plugged some headphones in, set the default audio output to the analog jack, and still got nothing. I verified nothing was muted, my sound was turned up to a decent volume... I still have no idea.\n\nA: The output option to HDMI was not shown. In pavucontrol, you could set the whole device to\n\nDigital Stereo (HDMI) Output\n\n\nThis might fix it for you.\n\nA: I had the very same problem installing Lubuntu on a new media center PC I built recently with an embedded A4-5000. I had to download PulseAudio in order to change the default audio output (if I recall it was trying to do SPDIF) to HDMI out. Why it does not do this automatically I don't know. I also had the crackling noise you mentioned when I finally got my audio working, had me pulling my hair out cause I could not find a solution that worked. \nI could not find the sample rates and such to tinker with in the pulseaudio.conf file some people mentioned, so I went in to the software center and downloaded Alsamixergui, Qasconfig, QasHctl, and Qasmixer to see if any of those programs had the necessary audio setting I needed to fiddle with. I couldn't find whatIi was looking for, but after I went into QasHctl and fiddling with the levels, the crackling is almost non-existent when watching Youtube.\nCreated an account just to reply, hope this helps.\n\nA: Open a terminal and type the following command to install the pulse audio volume control\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install pavucontrol\n\ndo a search for the app or execute pavucontrol. This is not the same as the volume control on your panel.\nYou will have more control over card selection and assigning devices. Also, sometimes unplugging and plugging the HDMI back in automatically toggles it into a working state.\n\nA: Simply open your video player and set the Video Option Output to HDMI. Bye.

I have a Gigabyte GB-BXA8-5545 motherboard with AMDA8-5545M, Trinity, with Radeon 8510G. My solution is to use ALSA, and then you just have to make sure your player is using the correct device.

On this computer, everything installed fine, and I got the message to reboot and the CD ejected. Then once the computer computer comes back on I get about 4 seconds of the purple colored Ubuntu screen and then it proceeds to the Desktop (I opted-in to lock in automatically) and after moving the mouse in about 3 seconds the computer freezes and that goes on for about 10 more seconds. And then it turns into the mess in the picture.\nMy computer model is eMachines el1333g 2GB RAM, got it about 3 or 4 years back.\nI saw someone else with this problem that had an emachines computer and their solution was to make sure the .iso was valid and not corrupted, so I re-downloaded and erased & installed and got the same thing.\nEDIT: also tried Mint, does the same thing after automatic boot up showing the desktop with the Install icon. And forgot to mention it's not the keyboard and mouse, I tried it with them in and it still froze. \nAny solutions?\n\nA: As I feel confident you will continue to use Ubuntu in the future, even if  you can never make it work on that one computer, I am offering you this one valuable piece of advice;  \"Prior to installing ubuntu on ANY pc, always put it through its paces using a live CD or flashdrive\".  I tell that to everyone.  It is never safe to assume Ubuntu will work correctly on one computer because you've used it successfully on another.\nMany times people wipe out dying Windows installations expecting Ubuntu to be the panacea, only to discover that the real reason windows appeared to be dying is that the hard drive or other hardware components were failing.  In so much as you are using an eMachines, it seems extremely likely.\nNow, if you'll allow me, I'll offer you the REAL solution, and one which even eMachines haters will approve of.  It is the solution I was forced to use with the last two eMachines brought to me.  REPLACE THE MOTHERBOARD.  If yours is one which will accept a standard mini-ATX such as a Gigabyte 78LMT, or a similar ASUS such as the M5A78L-M, you might be much happier with the result than buying an entirely new pc.\nI kid you not when I tell you I have yet to encounter an emachines which lasted more than about one year and didn't die emitting burnt insulation odors from chips on its motherboard.  They seem designed to fail, but replace the motherboard and you can experience gaming performance at a budget price.\n\nA: With other Linux versions running into the same issue, I would think it is an incompatibility with your hardware and Linux, specifically something wrong with your video hardware. The Nvidia hardware on that computer actually does have supported Linux drivers, so I really don't believe it is a software issue.\nJust for troubleshooting's sake, have you tried the 32-bit version? Since you only have 2gb of RAM, switching down to the 32-bit shouldn't make that much of a performance difference, but could provide a different result regarding any hardware conflicts you have with the 64-bit version.\n", "Q: Cannot change GTK and icon after changing LightDM greeter I changed my LightDM greeter and suddenly I cannot change my gtk or icon theme.

GTK3 applications are still stuck with the default theme and I can't get them to change at all.\nAnother clue:\nGTK 2 applications run as root are not using the theme I selected in lxappearance.\n\nA: I had to delete ~/.config/dconf/user while logged out (in other words, from a virtual terminal) to get my settings back to working order.

See https://superuser.com/a/125408 for the source of this command.\nHere's the generated diff file: http://sprunge.us/BFPS. There might be some pattern in this that can help diagnose the problem, I'm not sure what it would be, but including this just in case.\nIf there's any information that would be helpful, feel free to ask for it. I don't currently have the squashfs filesystem that generated that that difference file was generated from, but I can just run mksquashfs again if need be - it is consistently creating a file which isn't the same.\nThe version of mksquashfs/unsquashfs (from squashfs-tools):\nmksquashfs version 4.2-git (2013/04/07)\nunsquashfs version 4.2-git (2013/03/13)\n\nAny ideas on why this occurs or what I can do to help are greatly appreciated.\nEdit/Update:\nAfter upgrading from the version of squashfs-tools packaged with Ubuntu to squashfs v4.3, I still get an error, but not as much of one.\nRunning the above binary diff command produces this for the file compressed and decompressed using v4.3: http://sprunge.us/DDAM.\nIf you look at the binary diff files you see that the diff file produced with v4.3 is exactly the same as the last part of the file produced with 4.2-git. I would guess this probably means that part of the corruption was fixed in v4.3, but not all of it.\n\nA: Obvious point - you complain that Unsquashfs is generating a different file, but then demonstrate this by mounting the Squashfs filesystem and comparing that....\nIf the bug was in Unsquashfs you would expecting mounting the filesystem to work (giving the correct output).  If both Unsquashfs and mounting doesn't work, then the bug (if any) is likely to be in Mksquashfs.\n\nThe version of mksquashfs/unsquashfs (from squashfs-tools):\nmksquashfs version 4.2-git (2013/04/07)\nunsquashfs version 4.2-git (2013/03/13)\n\nThese look like snapshots from my git development tree (they have -git in the version).\nIt is possible they have been snapshotted when the development code was in an inconsistent state or had temporary bugs.\nYou should try the release versions of squashfs-tools.  Squashfs-tools 4.3 was released this year and you should try that.  This however has a known bug causing incorrect filesystems in certain cases (introduced in Sept 2011), but this doesn't look like the bug you're hitting.\nDepending on whether the above Squashfs-tools 4.3 works, you should also try the earlier release Squashfs-tools 4.2 (from 2011), and the latest development version from git (where the one known filesystem corruption bug has been fixed).\nThe release tarballs and the git development tree can be got from\nhttp://sourceforge.net/projects/squashfs\n", "Q: Error when installing GParted I am a new Ubuntu user.

Thanks in advance.\nE: dpkg was interrupted, you must manually run 'sudo dpkg --configure -a' to correct the problem.\"\n\n\nA: Running a root shell is not suggested or supported by the designers of Ubuntu. sudo  allows authorized users (normally \"Administrative\" users) to run certain programs as Root without having to know the root password. This means that in the terminal you should use sudo for commands that require root privileges; simply prepend sudo to all the commands you would normally run as Root.RootSudo\nIn Ubuntu the root account is not active by default, so the command su root would not work unless you had previously changed the password for the root account, which is not recommended.\nTo install GParted open the terminal and type:  \nsudo dpkg --configure -a  # fix the error message\nsudo apt-get install gparted  # install gparted\n\nRootSudo: página em Português\n\nA: Try the below commands on terminal to remove all the files inside /var/lib/dpkg/updates directory ,\ncd /var/lib/dpkg/updates\n\nsudo rm *\n\nAnd then run the below command to get newer ones,\nsudo apt-get update\n\nNow enter below command in terminal to install gparted :\nsudo apt-get install gparted\n\n\nA: It feels so good to upvote the two answers ahead of mine.  I am only commenting because I feel strongly that while I grok their answers, I feel a plain-English interpretation of the solution would be better appreciated by some.  Here goes:\nWhile the observation of the first answer is correct, and yes, your terminal command was in error for Ubuntu, your best bet is to use the graphical software installation utility to install gparted.  The following simplified instructions will permit anyone, with even the most minimal understanding of any operating system at all, to install GPARTED in less than one minute.\n\n\n*\n\n*Press your Windows key. \n\n*Type the keyboard characters SO When the Ubuntu Software Center icon is displayed, click on that, or simply press your ENTER key.\n\n*When the Software Center has loaded, type the keyboard characters, GPA\n\n*When the Gparted Partition Editor option appears, click that.  It should turn orange. \n\n*Press the INSTALL button.\n\n*Wait 20 seconds while it installs.\n\n\nThere is nothing wrong with becoming proficient with terminal commands.  It is especially useful if your goal is to compose scripts for complex installation problem solving.  However to simply install one program such as GPARTED, the software center is actually faster.\n", "Q: How do I fix black screen issue on my laptop?

Thank you\n\nA: This answer doesn't so much promise to solve the problem as much as to at least permit you to watch videos in the meantime while you are figuring it out.  You may even need to watch a video in order to solve your problem, so, anything that works, right?\nIf your computer has a working cd/dvd drive, please boot your computer to an ubuntu LIVE CD, such as 12 or 13, connect to the internet with it, and attempt to see if it will display videos.  \nI am betting it will, and I think you will agree that would be convenient.\n", "Q: Problem installing phpstorm 7 in ubuntu 14.04 I have been struggling with installing Phpstorm in Ubuntu 14.04 since I am new to Ubuntu.

(You can find these by executing the id in shell).\nNow clear the directories and mount tmpfs to them.\n\nrm -rf /home/username/.thumbnails/*\nsudo mount /home/username/.thumbnails\nrm -rf /home/username/.cache/thumbnails/*\nsudo mount /home/username/.cache/thumbnails\n\n\nA: It's very easy, make thumbnails folder as readable only.\nYou can do it only by sudo.\nYou will have your thumbs in RAM only!\n\nA: Temp thumbnail Cache using Systemd\nI wanted to give a systemd update to this. This is just taking what @lukasrozs already said here https://askubuntu.com/a/809084/1242385 but uses systemd mounts rather than modifying /etc/fstab.\nI'm going to assume your thumbnail cache is in a directory like /home/dephekt/.cache/thumbnails and that the user you want to mount this for is UID & GID 1000.\nThe unit file\n[Unit]\nDescription=Thumbnailer Cache tmpfs mount\nConditionPathIsSymbolicLink=!/home/dephekt/.cache/thumbnails\nDefaultDependencies=no\nConflicts=umount.target\nBefore=local-fs.target umount.target\nAfter=swap.target\n\n[Mount]\nWhat=tmpfs\nWhere=/home/dephekt/.cache/thumbnails\nType=tmpfs\nOptions=rw,mode=1755,relatime,nosuid,nodev,noexec,size=512M,uid=1000,gid=1000\n\n[Install]\nWantedBy=local-fs.target\n\nMount size\nYou can modify the size=256M mount option to be whatever size you think is sufficient for the thumbnailer cache. I set this to 512M, since my the default maximum cache size for me is 512M. You can find that setting by doing:\n$ gsettings get org.gnome.desktop.thumbnail-cache maximum-size\n512\n\nUnit file naming\nThe file needs to be named using the path you used in the Where= argument above, but properly escaped. In my case, the Where= path is /home/dephekt/.cache/thumbnails. To easily determine how systemd would want this to look escaped, you can do:\n$ systemd-escape --path --suffix=mount \"/home/dephekt/.cache/thumbnails\"\nhome-dephekt-.cache-thumbnails.mount\n\nThat gives you exactly what the filename should look like.\nPlacement & installation\nThen place the file in /etc/systemd/system and run:\nsudo systemctl daemon-reload\nsudo systemctl enable home-dephekt-.cache-thumbnails.mount\nsudo systemctl start home-dephekt-.cache-thumbnails.mount\n\nThis should cause the mount to happen right now and also automatically after booting.\n", "Q: Why do dist-upgrade and upgrade give different held packages? sudo apt-get upgrade\n\ngives:\nReading package lists...

I won't be installing any other OS on that machine.\nI mostly followed the steps outlined by this guide, except that my understanding was that grub2 supports both mdadm-created RAID and LVM2, and therefore no tinkering with /boot partitions is necessary (based on answers such as this; same user--@psusi--also commented on AskUbuntu to the same effect). Hence, I set the following partitioning scheme:\n\n\n*\n\n*Each drive has a single partition spanning as much of the drive as the server-live-installer would use (some 1MB remained unused at the end of each drive). I'll reiterate that my system doesn't support UEFI, so I'm left to assume the live-installer created an MBR table on all drives. These partitions are marked to be used in RAID.\n\n*A single RAID5 device md0 is created with these 3 partitions.\n\n*A single LVM physical volume fills md0. It has a single volume group srv-vg1, which contains 3 logical volumes:\n\n\n*\n\n*srv-lvboot contains 5GB and is used as ext4 and mounted as /boot\n\n*srv-lvswap contains 20GB (intentional overkill) and is used as LUKS with a random key, on which I created a single linux-swap partition (mounted as swap).\n\n*srv-lvroot spans the rest of the logical group and is used as LUKS with passphrase, on which I created a single ex4 partition mounted as /.\nUsing this partitioning scheme I continued with the installation, until I was prompted to Install the GRUB boot loader to the master boot record (of my first drive). I tried to continue, but an error message returned:\n\nUnable to install GRUB in /dev/sda\nExecuting 'grub-install /dev/sda' failed.\nThis is a fatal error.\n\nI can go back and attempt to install GRUB to a different device, but I don't know which one to choose (if I install it to md0 or srv-lvboot, assuming it would even work, wouldn't I then need to chainload it from another bootloader?). Also, I'm not 100% sure my partitioning scheme is viable. Can anyone assist?\n\nEdit:\nI eventually discovered that the reason why grub cannot install to the MBR of my first disk was because my disks (at 3TB) had a GPT table, so I should've created a 2MB partition with the bios_grub flag at the beginning of each drive. After doing that, the installation completes without errors. However, my server doesn't boot into Ubuntu. Rather, it keeps rebooting (apparently grub fails to load into the OS, for some reason). I attempted to use boot-repair to solve the issue, without success (it reportedly saved its logs to http://paste.ubuntu.com/9414135).\n\nA: As it turns out, the true underlying issue was that added at the end of my question: since the machine doesn't boot from UEFI, grub requires a dedicated partition (2MB is reportedly more than enough) with the \"bios_grub\" flag at the beginning of each drive (each drive you plan on being able to boot from if the array ever became degraded, at least). One can set those up in the live-installer by choosing to use those partitions for bios boot.\n(The reason this fix didn't initially work for me was that I created the partitions using another live-cd prior to running the Ubuntu Server installer, which messed things up a little.)\nI'd like note @kyodake's reminder regarding the necessity of installing grub to the MBR's of the rest of the disks in your RAID array (I find that manually running sudo grub-install /dev/sdX is fastest). Finally, for completeness sake I'll stress that the reason for the separate /boot partition is that this way one can encrypt the rest of the filesystem (as outlined in the guide I linked to, and summarized in my own partitioning scheme). If one isn't inclined to implement full-volume-encryption, there's really not a good reason to create a separate partition.\n\nA: Grub2 is fully RAID and LVM aware. \nIn fact you do not need a separate /boot partition at all.\nYou need also grub-install to all of the drives in the raid5.\nThe Ubuntu grub-pc package will prompt you to check off all of the drives you want it installed on and install it for you.\n", "Q: Image of Ubuntu 12.04 LTS for 64-bit I want to install Ubuntu 12.04 LTS on my Lenovo ThinkPad that has 64-bit architecture, but where do I find a 64-bit version of 12.04?\nIt doesn't seem to appear on this site\n\nA: Here is the link to Ubuntu 12.04 64bit but its legit torrent file\nor visit official site, at the bottom you will links to all supported ubuntu releases\n\nif above links are not working, here is mirror link from University of Maryland\n", "Q: Xbmc PVR error, trying to enable IPTV I'm running ubuntu 14.04 64 bit, latest Beta version of xbmc, aka Kodi.

Using the keyboard shortcut F4 to disconnect does not disconnect the session so the only way I can get out if it is to kill it through the system monitor.\nAny ideas how to resolve this as it is extremely frustrating?\n\nA: To exit full screen mode in Remmina, press the right hand side Ctrl key and f together. \n\nA: It's a bug, see\nhttps://github.com/FreeRDP/Remmina/wiki/Remmina-Usage-FAQ point 3\nIt's apparently fixed but not in the version that ships with yakkety.\nAs a workaround you can use HostKey+F (HostKey can be set in Edit > Settings > Keyboard and by default is set to the right Ctrl key). HostKey+F toggles the Fullscreen Mode and you can go back to your normal Desktop if the remmina-window is not in fullscreen. \n\nA: Ok I can disconnect by using CTRL_R + F4 however I cannot get T for show/hide toolbar to work no matter what I key combo I use with it.\nI've renamed the .remmina folder and and restarted remmina and recreated one of my connections and I get the same issue so I guess it's a bug (as they still have the reference to the toolbar in shortcuts so doesn't look like they've removed it).\n\nA: You are correct, even the 1.2 release of Remmina doesn't properly show the tabs or exit in Ubuntu. \nI found that if I use the Right Ctrl+← I can switch between remote sessions, and that in a Windows Server 2012 session I can bring up the menu to power off and a small menu pops up labeled 'disconnect.' Only in that way was I able to shut down the session.\n\nA: I'm running Ubuntu 16.04 LTS with remmina.  \nYou can always use Alt + Tab to get back to your desktop and to the remmina control screen.  Just like with Windows.  \nWhen you get to the control screen you can use Edit -> Preferences -> Keyboard.  \nThe top option is the \"Host key\"\nClick on the box that says \"Control_R\" and then it will prompt you to press another key.  \nIn my case, my mini-keyboard does not have a Right-hand Ctrl key, so I press the Left one. \nIt then displays \"Control_L\" and I click on \"Close\" then click on the maximized window which is underneath.\nYou can also use Alt + Tab to get back to the full-screen session.\nVoila, the left-hand Ctrl + f works to un-maximize it and bring back the toolbars on top.\n", "Q: Error installing Android Studio!

(Unsure whether the guide originally was intended to be used with just the internal HDD)\n\n*The guide tells you to disable secure boot. Is the intent that you will never enable secure boot again? I only ask because I thought Ubuntu 14.10 was supposed to be compatible with secure boot.\n\n*Whenever I boot the machine, it defaults to a command line interface for grub. I have to type exit, and then it sometimes goes into the grub GUI, but not always, it sometimes bypasses grub and boots up Windows.\nAny assistance is greatly appreciated. I didn't know how to direct the question to the guy who posted the solution, and didn't have enough reputation points to comment on the original post.\n\nA: *\n\n*Yes the guide is intended to be used with the internal HDD. So you need to partition your disk to make some room for linux prior to install it.\n\n*Disabling Secure boot is required in this tutorial as it doesn't show how to enable it again. This blog post talks about re-enabling the secure boot. But his solution doesn't seem perfect. I personaly do not concider this as a primary issue, and I am running without Secure boot, although, when a better solution will emerge I'll probably apply it.\n\n*About your issue of landing on a grub command line before having the actual grub customized UI. Hmm, you should probably focus on getting the classical grub running. Once you've secured this, you can optional dive deeper to get the Graphical UI running.

You should be fine, but me personally, when looking at transitioning dozens of important packages, I'd still wonder if a fresh install isn't too far off, so I'd backup my stuff anyways.\n\nA: An LTS to LTS upgrade will focus on upgrading Ubuntu to a more current version and try and make use of old configuration files, your home partition should be left alone as it is personal data. That is if the upgrade is successful sometimes it can go wrong but this does not very often. I strongly recommend backing up your files on a external hard drive before upgrading. Next download the ISO and burn it to a disk use that to upgrade from 12.04 LTS to 14.04 LTS.

You can unmount the swap drive, but that's not enough.  So, you need to boot Linux from a cd or usb drive, then run gparted.  The original Ubuntu disk will work, just don't install, but use the feature to try it out without making changes (ie, live CD).\nOnce you run gparted from another disk, you will want to resize sda3, the container for the logical drives, by selecting resize, and dragging it all the way to the left. Then, do the same for sda5, so it fills the partition.  Finally, click the chekbox icon to apply the changes, and be prepared to wait a few hours, as resizing the partition to the left requires moving all the data.  If you had left space at the end, then it would have been much quicker to resize to the right.\nMake sure you do not turn off the power while this is happening.  A power outage could be disastrous, so if you have a desktop, a UPS is a good thing to have.  If you were to have a power outage, you might be able to cancel the operation.\nIf you have a laptop, make sure the battery is charged, and leave it plugged in.\n", "Q: How to download audio from web page other then youtube from command line?

My wifi has never caused me problems until I tried to connect to an Asus RT-AC68U gigabit router. Then suddenly, the connection kept dropping, etc. Same problem noted in this thread. But on my older Netgear router at home, the connection is always stable. The fix that worked for me was to purchase an Asus USB-N53 wifi adapter. My onboard wifi used the Broadcom driver, and there seems to be a problem with these drivers and the newer routers. Reinstalling the driver and trying the other remedies listed on various forum threads did not work. The other nice thing about the USB adapter is that even though it is not a perfect solution (the connection still can drop sometimes, although rarely), it can easily be power cycled by unplugging then replugging in (versus doing \"services networking restart\" or rebooting).\n", "Q: Problems with aircrack-ng I'm trying to crack an wifi, but when i type sudo airmon-ng start wlan0 it shows this:  \nFound 4 processes that could cause trouble.\nIf airodump-ng, aireplay-ng or airtun-ng stops working after\na short period of time, you may want to kill (some of) them!\n\nPID Name\n463 avahi-daemon\n475 avahi-daemon\n683 NetworkManager\n756 wpa_supplicant\n\nInterface   Chipset     Driver\n\nwlan0       Broadcom    wl - [phy0]mon0: ERROR while getting interface flags: No such device\n\n                (monitor mode enabled on mon0)\n\nThen, when I type sudo airodump-ng mon0 for the list with available BSSID it shows this:  \nsudo airodump-ng mon0\nInterface mon0: \nioctl(SIOCGIFINDEX) failed: No such device\n\nWhat can cause this? \nThis is my wconfig:  \nwlan0     IEEE 802.11abg  ESSID:off/any  \n          Mode:Managed  Access Point: Not-Associated   \n          Retry short limit:7   RTS thr:off   Fragment thr:off\n          Power Management:off\n\nppp0      no wireless extensions.\n\nlo        no wireless extensions.\n\nMy OS is 14.10.

I'm using xubuntu 14.04 on AMD based hardware. It is configured not to lock a session and not to power down automatically on longer idle times.\nThere have been no recent changes or new software installations other than notified security updates.\nI also have the kde desktop installed. The display manager is LightDM, AFAIK.\nThe system has been behaving nicely for some months, until a couple of days ago. Now, after about ten minutes idle the session is locked automatically.

C drive, D drive and E drive and a 100MB system drive). I have nearly 150 GB unallocated space which I want to be used for Ubuntu installation. But while dual boot and manual installation option the the unallocated space is written as unusable space and there is no option to do changes for that space....so please tell me what to do.\nSanchit\n\nA: You can try formatting that unallocated space as ext4 from Ubuntu Live CD/USB using gparted.\nChoose \"Try Ubuntu\" option during installation of Ubuntu.\nTo launch gparted, open a terminal by pressing ctrl+alt+t and typing sudo gparted.\n\nA: I'd expect windows would normally allocate all the space in a HD, so just in case he means \"free space\" inside his 3 partitions (and there really isn't 150GB of unpartitioned HD space) then you'd need to shrink one of the partitions and make some unallocated/unpartitioned space for a new Ubuntu partition.\nThe solution could be to run gparted (if from terminal sudo gparted) like julka suggests, but involves shrinking a partition first, then when there's enough space making new partition(s).\nOr, Windows should be able to shrink one of it's partitions too, especially if it's formatted as NTFS and you don't fully trust Ubuntu to play with NTFS (linux support for ntfs is not perfect, still need windows chkdsk to fix some problems, I read somewhere it's reverse-engineered, MS doesn't want to help write free software for NTFS for some reason).\n", "Q: Problems setting up/using dwww I have installed dwww and I am able to display the home page (\"ubuntudesktop/dwww\").

However, I've discovered that updating or messing around with the kernel doesn't seem to do great things with the Live version and so after seeing it didn't boot anymore ended-up having to reformat the USB and then start again. Obviously I save all files on a different drive, but I realized that it would be a good idea in future to have a backup of the settings and installed programs and other Ubuntu-specific things to save the hassle in case it happens again.\nIt occurred to me that instead of using a program to backup only a certain part, considering that the persistence is only 4GB, I could just go into Windows and backup the contents of the entire USB to another drive, say, on a weekly basis, and then if I found it became corrupted or didn't boot for some reason, (assuming it was an issue with the data rather than the MBR) I could go back into Windows and copy the entire contents of the backup to overwrite the data on the USB drive, thereby having what would hopefully be an uncorrupted, but relatively up-to-date fresh version of Ubuntu again, without having to go through the process of reinstalling programs, changing settings, etc.\nMy question is ... would this very primitive method work? I'm wondering whether there are other aspects of the Live USB system itself which would detect that everything had been replaced. I can't think of anything specifically that might become a problem, but I just want to make sure because obviously otherwise it's not going to be a very useful form of backup! Any assurance or advice would be very appreciated, and please don't laugh at my distinctly string-and-paper approach to technology!\n\nA: You need not copy the entire contents of the USB drive. Just copy the casper-rw file to the computer as a backup.\ncasper-rw is the name of the file where the Live USB stores persistent information.\nThe next time you need to create a USB drive with the same settings and applications, create a live USB using uNetbootin or any other program and copy your backed up copy of casper-rw to it.\n\nA: You can not just add casper-rw to a Live, (non persistent), install of Ubuntu and expect persistence.\nYou can make this method work if you press F6 at boot and add \" persistent\", (That is -space-persistent), to the menu after \"quiet splash --\". You need to do this every boot.\nOr \nYou can make a Persistent install using Startup Disk Creator or UNetbootin and replace the casper-rw file with the new one.\nOr\nDepending on the installer, you can edit, syslinux.cfg or loopback.cfg or txt.cfg in a Live, (non-persistent), install and add \" persistent\" after \"quiet splash --\".\n\nA: You can also use the gnome-disks utility, select the drive and on the tree dot menu select Create Disk Image...\"\nGnome Disks\n\nA: If you create your persistent live drive with mkusb, and use the dus-persistent method, there are shellscripts to use in order to back up the whole partition for persistence or only the home directory. (The home directory is more robust, can be ported to new versions of the same flavour of Ubuntu, and is also less sensitive to corruption than some other parts of the Ubuntu system.)\nThe shellscripts backup and restore are modified to manage not only the old label casper-rw but also the new label writable for the partition for persistence.\nSee the following links,\n\n*\n\n*mkusb - Backup_and_restore_of_persistent_overlay_data\n\n\n*Backup_&_restore_of_the_whole_casper-rw_partition\n\n\n*Backup_&_restore_of_the_home_directory_in_a_casper-rw_partition\n", "Q: Problem starting JACK server \"Jack Server is not running or cannot be started\" I haven't been able to get JACK to work despite googling and reading on forums.

I am doing something wrong?\nEDIT: My pc is a lenovo intel core i3, 2,53GHz, 4 GB DDR3 SDRAM\n\nA: This is quite normal if the system memory is low. The entire operating system will be loaded on system memory and can be frustratingly slow if memory is full.\nIf you can add the system configuration that will help in giving a better answer.\n\nA: For a live (usb/cd/dvd) Ubuntu it doesn't use the hard drive, but it does read from the usb/cd when it loads programs, and that could be as slow as your usb drive.\nWith 4GB of ram that should be plenty to only try out a few programs, Ubuntu live uses ram to store all your files so it could get filled up if you download lots or have the web browser cache too big. \nRunning out of ram used to freeze older Ubuntu's, and the \"real\" used ram is a combination of what free reports plus the files in ram (from df -t overlayfs -t devtmpfs -t tmpfs --total |tail -n 1|tr -s [:space:]|cut -d \" \" -f 3 in MB's for example). \nBut, newer Ubuntu's just semi-freeze and give errors, but you still have a chance to keep running.\nIf you booted it with the toram option (added after the \"noprompt noeject\" and before \"--\" in the boot menu, F6 should do it, more info here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BootOptions#Changing_the_CD_Boot_Option_Configuration_Line )  that would copy the whole iso/squashfs into ram, so loading programs from the iso would be FAST.\nAnd, it could be that your internet connection is the slow part, network/dns settings are different or slow? Or maybe some hardware isn't 100% functional in Ubuntu, slowing down the internet, or even other hardware is slow for some reason, cpu frequency stuck on \"low\" or \"powersave\" or similar?\n", "Q: Trying to connect a Samsung m2020w printer to wireless network I have a Samsung m2020w printer.

The default file permissions are 666. Thus, if you have a umask value of 002 (or 0002), you end up with 775 directory permissions and 664 file permissions. The 775 number means \"read,write,execute\" for the user, \"read,write,execute\" for the group, and \"read,execute\" for others. The 664 number means \"read,write\" for the user, \"read,write\" for the group, and \"read\" for others. source\n\n\nA: Since you're making webusers the group owner of the directory, if the user that the webserver runs under is part of that group, you shouldn't need a chown.\nFor example, the usual user of webserver process on Ubuntu is www-data, and that user is part of the www-data group. By making any directory owned by the www-data group, the webserver would be able to access it using normal group permissions (which are 755 by default).\n", "Q: Ubuntu 11 display manager startup problem Several days ago we had a power failure.\nWhen I rebooted my Ubuntu Linux box, it initially came up displaying the F in the center of the screen but never went to the login.\nInstead it goes to a black terminal look.\nThere is a cursor which responds to the mouse and an underline at the top left corner of the screen which does nothing.\nThe process list shows 4 /usr/bin/Xorg processes owned by root and  there are many processed owned by gdm.\ngdm restart produces the following error:\n[root@BTRC-Server01 ~]# gdm restart\n\n** (gdm-binary:11700): WARNING **: Failed to acquire org.gnome.DisplayManager\n\n** (gdm-binary:11700): WARNING **: Could not acquire name; bailing out\n\nAny help would be appreciated.\n\nA: Scenario like, your Ubuntu GDM(Display Manager) got corrupted due to sudden power failure & it can't be restarted so.

This is quite annoying...\nIs is possible to customize the scroll handles so I always see them and so that they scroll up all the way?\n\nA: The scrollbar in Ubuntu is called overlay scrollbar. If you find the need to disable it, you can refer to a previous question at How do I disable overlay scrollbars?.\n\nA: I haven't used Unity lately, but it should have some settings, like in XFCE and old gnome2, MATE, I know there are options to edit the settings. Should be something like Window Manager Style/Themes or Appearance Style that could change the scrollbars (and the window borders, shapes, \"thickness\" of the edges, icons...)\nMay need to add a package for more Themes or Styles, depending on your particular desktop (for example, XFCE has xfwm4-themes) or there might even be some others to download from the web.\n\nAND, I haven't run plain old Ubuntu for a while, but I do remember they started using weird scrollbars. If that's what you're talking about, then Anthony Wong's answer could be it, settings to disable the \"overlay-scrollbar\", or you could remove them completely with apt-get remove overlay-scrollbar (I think I used to do that with regular Ubuntu, but switched to XFCE that has \"regular\" scrollbars.\n", "Q: How do you grow partition on 4 terabyte disk I used Clonezilla to copy an ext4 1.5 terabyte disk to a 4 terabyte disk.

Repeated trials show it only allows me to fill to half the disk (2 terabytes); otherwise I get an error message saying \"see details\", although there are none.  I suspect that Gparted is operating 32 bit, even though I am running it from a live Ubuntu 64 bit 14.04 media edition DVD.  If Gparted included with 64-bit Ubuntu is limited to 2 terabyte due to 32-bit arithmetic, what else can I use to grow the partition?  Is there a 64-bit Gparted or equivalent?\n\nA: Your filesystem has MBR (Master Boot Record), in MBR maximum partition size is 2TB(tera byte) only, so that's why you are not able to do this.\nTo make the system capable of this, you need to replace your MBR with GPT (GUID Partition Table). It allows you to create one partition up to 2PB(peta byte).\nTo replace you can read this link : How can I change/convert a Ubuntu MBR drive to a GPT?\nFor difference between MBR & GPT go to this link or DuckDuckGo.\n", "Q: Alt+F1 doesn't work I'm using Ubuntu 14.10 and gnome 3.14.

Either it has been wipe out by the ubuntu installation or it is still there waiting to be boot up.\nYou need to look at other thread to look for your windows and how to enable booting it\n\nA: I guess grub didn't updated good after your reinstallation. You could try this to get windows back on the boot list:\nsudo update-grub\n\n\nA: Whether or not your Ubuntu install is encrypted has nothing to do with your issue, it very much looks like you told the installer to put it over Windows and onto the whole disk (apart from the uefi boot partitions).\nThe encryption only plays a role in gparted not being able to look into the luks-disk layout ubuntu created.\n[On the up side, your better off without Windows]\n\nA: You have to wipe your hard drive to encrypt whole drive. Therefore, Windows is not in your hard drive anymore. Windows and other data on the hard have been erased.

If the file already exists, then > will overwrite the file where as >> will append the data to the file.\nSo ls > myfile will create a document named myfile if it doesn't exist. If myfile is already present and contains some data, then it will be overwritten with the new data you pass it.\nWhereas ls >> myfile will create a file if doesn't exist and write data to it. If the file exist with some data, then new data gets added to its end. \n\nA: > & >> are redirection operators; they transfer output of something, in this case ls, elsewhere.\nIf this output goes to a file, > will truncate the file - ie delete any previous content, whereas >> will append new data onto the end of the file, keeping previous content.\nThis will work with any input, so echo & cat, for example, can also be used this way.\nAlso of interest is the | operator, which passes the data to another application - so ls | cat -n will give you a line-numbered listing !\nPipes is the relevant term.\n\nA: IF you use a single >, then it will overwrite the file if it already exists. Be very careful when you use this one.\nIf you use two >>, then it will just append (in other words, start writing at the bottom of the file) if it already exists. Otherwise, it creates a new file if it doesn't exist.\n", "Q: Win7 won't resume from sleep/hibernation I read many posts about this problem, but most of them consider the user a linux expert who knows what he's talking about :/ I would really appreciate it if someone can solve this problem for a beginner like me.\nI have installed Linux on my laptop with dual boot.

It's is also in my path. If I try to run a script from anywhere else in my system but within that folder, I get\n  sh: 0: Can't open [name of script].sh\n\nIf I execute something like sh ~/bin/killwine.sh it works\nI would like to be able to execute the script from anywhere without changing my location.\nWhat am I doing wrong?\n\nA: When you type sh somescript.sh, the system looks for sh in the path not somescript.sh. \nThen the system finds sh and passes the argument somescript.sh to it. Then sh looks for somescript.sh in the current folder or in the specified folder ~/bin/ if you typed \nsh ~/bin/somescirpt.sh. \n\nTo make the system look for somescript.sh in the path use it directly as a command, without the sh prefix. In other words, type in the terminal:\nsomescript.sh\n\nFor that to work, somescript.sh needs located in a folder in the path, in this case ~/bin/ and it needs to be executable, as others have pointed out. I include the command below for completeness.\nchmod +x ~/bin/somescript.sh\n\nAlso see How do I run .sh files? and \nHow to run scripts without typing the full path?\nHope this helps \n\nA: As the comment said, your script may not be marked for execution. When you call it trough sh what you're doing is telling the shell to read its content and execute the functions inside the text file, is not the same as calling an executable directly. Try this:\nchmod +x ~/bin/killwine.sh\n\nThen, try to execute it again from another directory. Also, make sure the first line on the script contains this, so the system knows that it has to be executed by a shell:\n#!/bin/sh\n\n\nA: As darent and user68186 explained the script may not have the executable bit set. If the bit is set you can run the script if you're in the directory the script is in simply by prefixing it with ./. For example:\n\n./myscript.sh\n\nYou don't have to have the .sh at the end of the filename either, but it's good form to append the .sh to let others know it's a shell script.\n", "Q: Dropbox not installed properly on 1204 I have tried to install Dropbox, here is my situation now:\n1) I start my laptop and them a popup appears where I have to enter my sudo-password such that Dropbox can run as Superuser.\n2) I enter the password, after which the terminal starts downloading Dropbox.

I'm attaching another screenshot of it:\n\n\nA: See if this makes sense.\nFile sizes are traditionally measured in binary, and so are counted in multiples of 1024, which is 2^30\nGB here means 2^30, and not 10^9.\n2^30*8=8589934592\n10^9*8=8000000000\n\nSo the size of your 8GB card is 8589934592, the difference in size, is reserved for card functionality, and OS reserved.\nOne kilobyte is a little more than one thousand bytes, specifically 1,024. A megabyte represents more than a million bytes or 1,048,576. A gigabyte is 1,073,741,824 bytes and so on. The exact number is gained by taking 2^n power. Example: KB = 2^10; MB = 2^20; GB = 2^30.\n\nAll computer data is stored in a binary format as either a one or zero\n  (called a bit). Eight of these bits together are most commonly called\n  a byte. Storage capacity is measured by a prefix to the B (byte) to\n  represent a specific amount, ie K (Kilobyte), M (Megabyte), G\n  (Gigabyte), T (Terabyte) etc. Since all computers are based on the\n  binary system, these prefixes represent base 2 amounts. Each level is\n  an increment of 2 to the 10th power or 1,024. \nThe common prefixes are as follows:\nKilobyte (KB) = 1,024 Bytes\nMegaByte (MB) = 1,024 Kilobytes or 1,048,576 Bytes\nGigabyte (GB) = 1,024 Megabytes or 1,073,741,824 Bytes\nTerabyte (TB) = 1,024 Gigabytes or 1,099,511,627,776 Bytes\n\nThis is very important information because when a computer operating\n  system or program reports the available space on a drive, it is going\n  to report the overall total of available bytes or reference them by\n  one of the prefixes. So, an OS reporting a total space of 74.51 GB\n  actually has around 80,004,503,306 Bytes of storage space.\nAdvertised vs. Actual\nSince consumers don't think in base 2 mathematics, manufacturers\n  decided to rate most drive capacities based on the standard base 10\n  numbers we are all familiar with. Therefore, one Megabyte equals one\n  million bytes while one Gigabyte equals one billion bytes. This isn't\n  too much of a problem with fairly small numbers such as a Kilobyte,\n  but each level of increase in the prefix also increased the total\n  discrepancy of the actual space compared to the advertised space.\nHere is a quick reference to show the amount that the actual values\n  differ compared to the advertised for each common referenced value:\nMegabyte Difference = 48,576 Bytes\nGigabyte Difference = 73,741,824 Bytes\nTerabyte Difference = 99,511,627,776 Bytes\n\nBased on this, for each Gigabyte that a drive manufacturer claims,\n  they are over reporting the amount of disk space by 73,741,824 Bytes\n  or roughly 70.3 MB of disk space. So, if a manufacturer advertises an\n  80 GB (80 billion bytes) hard drive, the actual disk space is around\n  74.5 GB of space, roughly 7% less than what they advertise.Information Technology, Mangalam Publishers\n\n\nA: When you ran fdisk -1 and you observed the size of that card, what information did it present about partitions on that card? Usually when you buy a new SD card it will most likely have the reserved space Mitch mentions on a separate partition, which MIGHT account for you seeing a lower value than you expect.\nAlso, I think that one thing Mitch is forgetting is that manufacturers print \"plain\" information when trying to sell to consumers. For instance, my test-linux box has a 120GB maxtor hdd in it. That is what is on the label, that was the number printed on the package, yet when I run fdisk it reports 120,000,000,000.0 in bytes, not 128,849,018,880 bytes. The USB flash drive I have on me atm (8GB) shows 8,006,926,336 bytes, not 8,589,934,592.0000\nbytes if we measured it in binary. My external SSD drive (256GB) weighs in as 256,055,212,769 bytes, not the 274,877,906,944 we would see if measuring in binary.\nSo, while WE measure file sizes in binary, manufacturers don't always seem to do so with mass-consumer products.\nI will say, however, that I have never had an SD card report the total number of bytes at what the advertised capacity is. My 2GB SD card that I have plugged in to my linux box only shows 1,962,856,448 bytes. I can't remember an SD card EVER showing the advertised bytes.

I click that and it says Restart to continue. I press restart and then the computer reboots into Windows. Nothing else happens.  Here is what it says:\n\nWhat to do?\n\nA: That option installs WUBI, which is no longer supported, should not be used, and is thoroughly incompatible with newer UEFI systems.\nIf you simply wish to try Ubuntu without risk to your existing Windows 8 install, use the 'Try Ubuntu' option instead of launching the installer. This will launch an Ubuntu session entirely in RAM; nothing will be installed to your hard drive.\nIf you have tried Ubuntu, and decided you want it, and if your hardware will support it, the safest way is to install a Virtual Machine application in Windows, and install an Ubuntu VM guest. Note that the VM depends upon the Windows host - a broken or compromised Windows install will break Ubuntu, too.\nAlternately, you can modify your Windows install, shrink your partitions, and install Ubuntu and Windows side-by-side. Repartitioning a Windows system is risky - you might break your Windows install and lose your data. Make sure your data is fully backed up before starting. If you wish to repair or reinstall Windows someday, make sure you have your Windows Product Key written down, else you must purchase a new key from Microsoft.\nAlternately, you can delete your entire Windows install and replace it with an Ubuntu system. This process will delete all data and applications. Windows applications do not work on Ubuntu at all, and --depending upon your skill level-- there may be a bit of culture shock. Before transitionin OS, change to multi-platform applications(like LibreOffice instead of MSOffice) to make the transition easier.\n", "Q: How to make a executable blender file into debian(.deb) I have made a game(1.5a release version) in Blender and I want to make it debian(so evryone can install it trought Software center with .deb file).

In my app, I use an OptionSelector to choose from a list of bike stations. I also have a map component with placemarkers for each station.\nWhen I tap a placemarker, it also changes the OptionSelector to the index of the corresponding station, as this is good UX.\nWhat isn't good UX is how the OptionSelector responds to this index change, which is animating itself as if it had been flicked by the user's finger. In other words, long after the user has tapped the map marker and received all the information they need, the OptionSelector is still \"spinning\" to the index of the station.\nHere is a video demonstrating this behaviour:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXKWlAmNYsw\nI'd like for this OptionSelector to just change its index immediately, with no animation. Is there a way to do this?\nHere's how I currently do things. I'm more than happy to be corrected if this is the wrong way of going about this. I use a WorkerScript (a QML thread, more-or-less) to make API calls. When this WorkerScript returns, it moves the OptionSelector like so:\nWorkerScript {\n    id: queryStationsWorker\n    source: \"../js/getstations.js\"\n\n    onMessage: {\n        [...]\n\n        // Move the OptionSelector to the corresponding station's index.\n        stationSelector.selectedIndex = getLastStationIndex(lastStation.contents.stationName, stationsModel)\n\n        /*\n         * For the sake of clarity:\n         *\n         * getLastStationIndex() is a function which just returns an integer.\n         * lastStation is a U1DB database used for state saving.\n         * stationsModel is a model containing all of the stations.\n         */\n    }\n}\n\nAny help or insight appreciated - cheers!\n\nA: You can see a copy of the OptionSelector qml here it uses UbuntuNumberAnimation when it's not expanded. There's no option for switching it off and if the feature is required you're going to have to patch upstream and wait a while for new versions of the library.\nYou could make your own open selector widget though, remove the animation part and make sure you rename it for use in your code. I recommend this route.\n", "Q: Xubuntu Conflicting With BIOS OK, so i installed Ubuntu on a hard drive the other day so i took that hard drive and kept it in my storage (place where i normally keep my hard drives). When i put it back in my computer it was working fine all was good until i tried to change the boot order in the BIOS and boot from USB OR CD i found out that it Ubuntu just ignored this and kept on with the normal booting process i have tried multiple times please what could be the problem. I have not tried to do anything to the hard drive at all\n\nA: This is an issue with either your BIOS or your boot medium. Xubuntu has no way of preventing your system from booting up off of external media.\nOnce you configure your boot device order in your BIOS and ensure that you have enabled booting from any sources that you wish to boot from, the BIOS will follow the following process at system startup:\n\nFrom this process, you can see that, if you have configured your BIOS to boot from USB or CD before your HDD or wherever you have your Xubuntu installation, the entire device upon which you have installed Xubuntu does not factor in to the success of booting off of your USB drive or CD at all.\n", "Q: Wifi disabled by hardware switch: bug or failed hardware?

Also device filters are not working.\nI am pretty sure that this is a rights problem because it works perfectly when starting VirtualBox as root.\nHere is my current setup:\n\n\n*\n\n*Host OS: Ubuntu 14.04.1 (64bit)\n\n*Guest OS: Windows 7 (64bit)\n\n*VirtualBox 4.3.20 r96996\n\n*Guest additions are installed\n\n*Package was downloaded from virtualbox.org\n\n\nAnd this is what I tried so far:\n\n\n*\n\n*Followed the advice given in https://askubuntu.com/a/25600/14220, most importantly\n\n*\n*\n\n*Made sure that I am part of the vboxusers group\n\n\n*\n*\n\n*Switched USB support settings in VirtualBox on an off\n\n\n*Added my user account to the lp group\n\n*Added usbuser group and set the udev permissions for it as suggested by http://discussions.tomtom.com/t5/GO-800-1000-series-Via-series/My-Tomtom-in-virtuellem-Computer-z-B-Virtualbox/td-p/420042#M9758 (sorry, German text but you should get the gist)\n\n*Made sure I have the \"Use VirtualBox virtualization solution\" user right as described in https://askubuntu.com/a/147791/14220\n\n*Restarted both the guest and the host when changing user account settings\n\n\nSlowly, I am running out of ideas. Most other posts I read about this problem were solved by adding the user to the vboxusers group. However, this did not fix it for me.\nI think it might be possible that whatever resource needs to be accessed to handle USB devices is for some reason not accessible for the vboxusers group. I do not know which resource this is so I am unable to check.\nCould you point me in the right direction to investigate this further?\n\nA: I had the same problem as you. The group virtualboxusers and so on were correct.\nAfter some search, it turns out that the kernel module did not correspond to the right version of my kernel (3.13.0-65-generic) and to my version of virtualbox (4.3).\nThe command\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure virtualbox-4.3\n\nsolved my problem.\nHope it will help you if the question is still problem still persists.\n\nA: I'm not sure if this will work, but these are the files owned by vbosusers on my machine, where USB is working right under Virtual Box.\nsudo find / -group vboxusers\n/dev/vboxusb\n/dev/vboxusb/002\n/dev/vboxusb/002/003\n/dev/vboxusb/001\n/dev/vboxusb/001/004\n\nIn another machine it looks like this\nsudo find / -group vboxusers\n/dev/vboxusb\n\nSo it looks like only ownership of /dev/vboxusb matters.\nHope that it helps.\n", "Q: Starting an application as a scheduled task does not work I have a seedbox under an Ubuntu desktop server.\nI can run rtorrent correctly but if I restart the server I need to relaunch rtorrent with this command: \nsudo -i\nscreen -fa -d -m rtorrent\n\nI would like use Scheduled Task, so I add at reboot the command screen -fa -d -m rtorrent, but that doesn't work...

Doing so, the upgrade process was unable to use the default radeon driver for your cards, because you had the frglx driver installed.  Since your old driver is not compatible with the newer kernel, we have 2 options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Downgrade to the kernel your frglx driver works with, or\n\n*Replace the frglx driver with the default driver and then manually install the older frglx driver.\n\n\nI personally prefer option 2. So without further ado, I present the\n\nResolution\n\n\n*\n\n*From the Command Prompt, issue a:\nsudo apt-get remove --purge xorg-driver-fglrx fglrx*\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall libgl1-mesa-glx:amd64 libgl1-mesa-dri:amd64 libgl1-mesa-glx:i386 libgl1-mesa-dri:i386 xserver-xorg-core\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg\n\n*sudo reboot\nThis should get lightdm started so you have a GUI, because we need a browser to go to the Legacy AMD Driver Download Page and Download  Legacy Version 13.1 for ATI Radeon Series 3xxx.  If something failed, and you have no GUI, issue:\n    sudo apt-get install wget && wget http://www2.ati.com/drivers/legacy/amd-driver-installer-catalyst-13.1-legacy-linux-x86.x86_64.zip\nSave this for later, as this driver only works for kernels where the version is <= 3.4.0.  Since the Ubuntu Kernel is now >= 3.13.0, we will run into the same issue again.  This leaves us 2 options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Manually Download the last available release of the 3.4 Kernel for Ubuntu Manually.  If you choose this option Download and install every .deb file in that directory, along with the patches.  Note: Using this option prevents you from upgrading to any kernel above Debian 3.4.105 during system updates!\nIn exchange for a permanently downgraded kernel, you may now install the legacy frglxdriverby unzipping the file above.  Be sure to use chmod +x on the extracted file.\n\n*Install the in-kernel Radeon Driver.  This was done in step 1 of the Resolution Section.  You can now delete /etc/X11/xorg.conf if you still have one.  In exchange for the in-kernel driver, you can continue upgrading to newer kernels as they come out.\n\nReferences\nX Troubleshooting -  Ubuntu Wiki - Purging frglx\nThe definitive guide to proprietary AMD graphics drivers\nUbuntu Wiki - Radeon Driver \n", "Q: Installling Ubuntu on older computer that does not seem to recognise cd drive I want to install Ubuntu on an older pc that is running Windows 98. I burned a cd download, but when I put it into the cd drive nothing happens (the disc is recognized as Ubuntu in Windows 8). I've tried changing the BIOS boot order and it will not boot. When I try to access the cd drive through windows it says \"E: is not accessible, Device is not ready\". The drive shows up in My Computer, but there are no system properties data. Through DOS, the system says it is an invalid drive. However, an old commercial video game (helicopter flight sim) does run properly through the cd, and it will play music cd's . \nThere are also USB ports (4). A memory stick plugged into one is not recognized as a valid drive (I tried installing that way first). However, on a screen that appears briefly before windows starts the memory stick is recognized and named (Kingston G3). \nIt has an Ethernet connection, but when I connect it and try to go online (internet explorer) it goes to modem installation wizard and the system cannot find one.\nIt has a floppy drive that works, and I have tried using 'rawrite -f sbm.bin(rawwritewin.exe sbm.bin)' to make a boot disc, but I can't get it to run in either windows or dos. I tried various combinations of that command, with spaces, without, and nothing (I did manage to format a disc properly using the 'run' command). The computer I can download Ubuntu from does not have a floppy drive. \nAnyone got any suggestions about what is going on? My computer/programming knowledge is only basic. \n\nA: Did you burn your installation CD using Windows 98?\nIf Windows 8 computer detects your cd-rom as Ubuntu installation CD then the problem is not the cd-rom media but BIOS settings of your Windows 98 computer.\nTry to find a bootable CD-ROM disk (maybe Windows 98 rescue CD?) just to verify that your BIOS settings are correct to boot from CD-ROM.\nGeneral issues:\n1. Eject CD right after burning it (wait until burning is totally finished) and put CD back just to test if Windows 98 can read this CD correctly\n2. Did you create a bootable iso CD? This is a common mistake at least for me when I burned my first installation CD's\n3. Did you calculate checksum's for downloaded iso before burning it to CD? \nOne option is to download iso-file again and save it different name (or rename older version before downloading) and compare that two files are equal. If they are not use newer version.\n4. Some older CD-ROM devices don't read for example CD-RW media correctly. Then you have to burn your CD using CD-R media. Check that you have burned your CD using media that is readable in your old computer.\n", "Q: dig doesn't work in Ubuntu 14.10, works in 12.04 in the same network I'm having an issue when trying to use dig at one of my computers running Ubuntu 14.10 Desktop 64 bit.

But then, when Ubuntu says its done, the usb write LED flickers for a long time. And when I pull out the USB during the flickering, the data transfer is not actually done and not all the data will have been written. \nIs there a fix to this?\n\nA: It happens because Ubuntu takes all the data from the disk that is to be written to the USB and save it in the RAM buffer (Depends on the capacity of RAM). Then Ubuntu shows that the data has been written to the USB but actually data is being transferred from the buffer to the USB at that time. So, if you remove your USB during the transfer (although Ubuntu has shown you the transfer is done), you'll find that all data has not been transferred. You can use \n\nsudo iotop\n\nto check for real time transfer between disk and other I/O and when you found that the transfer has really been done then you can safely remove the USB.\n\nA: Unmount the drive properly before you pull it out.. From terminal, use sync to make it write now, sudo umount /path/to/stick to properly unmount it. From GUI file manager, there are quite a lot of ways to do this - you may have a symbol next to the drive icon, or right-click it & eject or unmount. \nYou can't reliably just pull out a stick in any common OS, as writes are cached to let your commands take priority - if you did multiple edits & it made you wait for each write, you'd not like it.

I've searched for a while, but I only see \"Create bootable flash drive!\" instructions.\n\nA: You wouldn't boot a live system from GRUB, but rather from the BIOS' boot device selection menu.\nMicrosoft gives an instruction on how to do this. It cuts down to these points:\n\n\n*\n\n*Press and old the volume down button and press the Power button\n\n*Release the volume down button as the Surface logo shows up and it should automatically boot the USB stick.\n\n\nWindows 7 will most likely not acknowledge the existence of any non-windows-supported file system, like EXT4, which is used for Ubuntu by default. So you may have to reinstall Ubuntu after that.\n\nA: Most probably you will need to use GParted to create a partition for your Windows OS and set it as NTFS or FAT32 so Windows can recognize the partition where to install it.\n", "Q: Annoying noise on Vaio S series when seeking music to other parts of the same song I'm using Ubuntu 14.04 on a Vaio S series computer (Model: SVS15136PGB).\nWhen playing a music, everything is fine, but when seeking music (by seeking I mean when i click on the progress bar of the music time to go to other parts of the same song) a really annoying noise comes out of the sound card.

With a statically assigned address, the 'gateway' doesn't get its NAT tables updated.  So whilst the packet may be being successfully forwarded outside to the internet, the gateway doesn't know what to do with the return/reply packets because its NAT wasn't configured.\nSo we need to configure the gateway box to use NAT for the .116 address.  If the gateway is a standard access point, they usually allow for static IP configuration by MAC (Media Access Controller) address via its web configuration interface:  give it the .116 address and the (.116 host's) MAC address (displayed using the 'ifconfig' command with the title 'HWaddr'), and set the host back to DHCP, and that way your host will have a static IP address the gateway knows to NAT.\n\nA: I actually shutdown the server via shutdown now command and restarted it, and now static ip works.  I thought using the reboot command was enough.  Not really sure what happened but it is working now.\n", "Q: Linux alternative to Windows Script Host I've just switched from Windows to Ubuntu.

You can save these scripts as .js or .vbs or .wsh files and double-click these files to execute their code.\nDoes Linux/Ubuntu have an alternative to the Windows Script Host?\n\nA: basicly BASH scripts provides all you would need with full fledged loops and conditions, variables and system calls, so that you can affect all the aspects of the system and automate tasks, and i think GNU/Linux in general is the master,in this kind of stuff, so VBS or JS, you have it in the form of Shell scripts, like i mentioned BASH is the famous amongs almost all the distributions, but it is not the only one out there, CSH, SH (bourne shell) KSH,TcSH and many many more.\ngood luck\n", "Q: Movgrab with Ubuntu 14.10?

The way that the partitions are set up, I believe my only option to make them bigger is to remove my ubuntu installation. At this point I've been having a lot of problems from messing around too much with ubuntu so reinstalling seems like a good idea anyway. \nBasically I have no idea how to go about doing this. I have no need to get rid of the grub bootloader or anything like that, I would just like to make sure I know how to safely do this without damaging my storage partition or windows installation. Thanks in advance for any advice.\n\nA: For re-installing Ubuntu it should be as simple as backing up & installing new.\nDeleting the data from the old Ubuntu \"/\" partition may not be necessary, but it couldn't hurt. If you've got your home on a different partition you can keep that and use it with the new Ubuntu, most of your settings and things should be waiting for you in the new Ubuntu then.\nThat's a good way to upgrade to a newer Ubuntu release too, used to be recommended more often in the past, especially if the in-place dist-upgrade has any problems (or to avoid them in the first place). \nIf you wanted to completely remove Ubuntu, then erasing it's partition would do it, and could leave GRUB and edit it's menu (grub.cfg file) to remove the Ubuntu boot options.

I can change the colour through preference , but how can I change the background colour and text colour of terminal through the command line?  \n\nA: See kos's answer for switching the foreground or background to a particular color of the palette, or even a direct RGB color in some terminals. The effect of such a sequence lasts until a different color is selected (or it's reverted to the default).\nAnother approach, supported by some terminal emulators, is to redefine the exact RGB values of the terminal's default foreground and background colors using the OSC 10 / 11 escape sequences:\necho -ne '\\e]10;#123456\\e\\\\'  # set default foreground to #123456\necho -ne '\\e]11;#abcdef\\e\\\\'  # set default background to #abcdef\n\nThis is likely to last much longer (until overridden by another OSC 10 / 11 or reset via OSC 110 / 111), but unlike the dconf approach, this still affects the current terminal only.\n\nA: On certain XTerm/ANSI-compatible terminals (like xterm and gnome-terminal), you can set colors using a palette bigger then the default 8/16-colors palette (for example using an 88-colors, 256-colors or 16777216-colors (RGB) palette; both xterm and gnome-terminal support both the 256-colors and the 16777216-colors (RGB) palette); mind that the shell might override this (this is the case e.g. for zsh).\nHere's a script to list the colors in the 256-color palette along with their ANSI color code in XTerm/ANSI-compatible terminals with a 256-color palette support:\n#!/bin/bash\nfor((i=16; i<256; i++)); do\n    printf \"\\e[48;5;${i}m%03d\" $i;\n    printf '\\e[0m';\n    [ ! $((($i - 15) % 6)) -eq 0 ] && printf ' ' || printf '\\n'\ndone\n\n\n\nDepending on whether you want to apply the color to the foreground or to the background, use an <fg_bg> value of 38 or 48 (respectively) in the following command:\nprintf '\\e[<fg_bg>;5;<ANSI_color_code>m'\n\nFor example, to set the foreground color (<fg_bg>=38) to red (<ANSI_color_code>=196) and the background color (<fg_bg>=48) to black (<ANSI_color_code>=0):\nprintf '\\e[38;5;196m Foreground color: red\\n'\nprintf '\\e[48;5;0m Background color: black\\n'\n\n\nIt's necessary to redraw the prompt using printf '\\e[K' in order for the background color to apply to the whole line and in order for the foreground color to apply to the cursor:\n \nThe same thing can be accomplished using RGB values instead of ANSI color codes in a compatible terminal; depending on whether you want to apply the color to the foreground or to the background, use an <fg_bg> value of 38 or 48 (respectively) in the following command:\nprintf '\\e[<fg_bg>;2;<R>;<G>;<B>m'\n\nFor example, to set the foreground color (<fg_bg>=38) to red (<R>=255, <G>=0, <B>=0) and the background color (<fg_bg>=48) to black (<R>=0, <G>=0, <B>=0):\nprintf '\\e[38;2;255;0;0m Foreground color: red\\n'\nprintf '\\e[48;2;0;0;0m Background color: black\\n'\n\n\nAgain, it's necessary to redraw the prompt using printf '\\e[K' in order for the background color to apply to the whole line and in order for the foreground color to apply to the cursor:\n\nUsing either methods, you can use printf '\\e[0m' to reset all the attributes:\n\n\nA: Information as found on this page, excluding preview column:\nSequences are composed of the Escape character (often represented by ”^[” or ”<Esc>”) followed by some other characters: ”^[FCm” (where FC is one of the numbers in the bulleted list below).\nIn bash, the Esc code can be either of the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*\\e\n\n*\\033 (octal)\n\n*\\x1B (hexadecimal)\n\n\nNote 1: The \"\\e[0m\" sequence removes all attributes (formatting and colors).

(Find latest BBB image).\nThe BBB is connected to my home Router via Cat5 AND USB cables. Understandably, I can directly SSH into the device over the Ethernet interface using the device's DHCP address (i.e. 10.0.0.X/8). \nHowever, once I configure my router to assign my BBB the Public IPv4 address (i.e. 120.40.x.x), the BBB disappears from the network. Unfortunately, this problem does NOT  reproduce when assigning the IP to a different machine. Please note, all of my computers utilize the DHCP service for receiving their own IP address.  \nFor trouble shooting, I removed the usb0 interface from the BBB's /etc/network/interfaces file and confirmed via ifconfig that it was so. Furthermore, I installed network-manager and restarted the service, as well as all devices.\nFinally ... The BBB only reappears when the public IP address assignment is removed, or if the public IP address is reassigned to a different device. Meaning to say, it receives a 10.0.0.x address once again. \nAlthough my question is very network themed, I think my problem is more likely solved in some other network configuration file instead. Belivably, it stems from the combination of using a mini-ubuntu version, as well as a preconfigured image from somebody else.\nIf somebody could assist me with coming to the solution, it will be very much appreciated.\nEdit:\n\n\nA: To establish a successful connection I had to switch [ifupdown] managed to 'true', even though all my other machines had very similar configuration settings.\nTo quote the NetworkManager manual: \n\nIf set to true, then interfaces listed in /etc/network/interfaces are\n  managed by NetworkManager.

But try \"step 10\" (reboot with the alt/option key pressed to boot from the usb stick) if you weren't already.\nI'm unfamiliar with mac's, but I'd suggest creating a Ubuntu cd/dvd/usb again using a different method. If you've got any dvd-r's or rewritable dvd-rw's around that might be the easiest, there appears to be an easy way to write an iso to a disk in mac.\n\nFirst, you should verify that the Ubuntu iso downloaded correctly with no errors. Using md5sum or sha256sum to verify is the standard way.\nThis link ( https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BurningIsoHowto#Verifying_the_ISO_integrity ) looks like some excellent instructions on downloading, verifying, and burning an iso (on mac/win/ubuntu), and checking the finished DVD, and a link to booting tips too.\n[Excerpt from BurningIsoHowto link\n above]\nVerifying the ISO integrity\nBefore burning a DVD, it is highly recommended that you verify the md5 sum or sha256 sum (hash) of the .iso file.  For instructions, please see HowToMD5SUM and HowToSHA256SUM.  For the current list of Official Ubuntu SHA256 hashes, see the SHA256SUMS file for the release you're using under http://releases.ubuntu.com (and optionally the PGP signatures in the SHA256SUMS.gpg file); hashes for the older MD5 algorithm are in the same directory. UbuntuHashes currently has only md5sums.  Checking the hash ensures that the file was not damaged during the download process and is 100% intact.\n\nHere's some instructions from http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/create-a-usb-stick-on-mac-osx\nHow to create a bootable USB stick on OS X\nWe would encourage Mac users to download Ubuntu Desktop Edition by burning a CD. But if you prefer to use a USB stick, please follow the instructions below.\nNote: this procedure requires that you create an .img file from the .iso file you download. It will also change the filesystem that is on the USB stick to make it bootable, so backup all data before continuing.\nTip: Drag and drop a file from Finder to Terminal to 'paste' the full path without risking typing errors.\n\n\n*\n\n*Download Ubuntu Desktop\n\n*Open the Terminal (in /Applications/Utilities/ or query Terminal in Spotlight).\n\n*Convert the .iso file to .img using the convert option of hdiutil e.g.,\nhdiutil convert -format UDRW -o ~/path/to/target.img ~/path/to/ubuntu.iso\nNote: OS X tends to put the .dmg ending on the output file automatically.\n\n*Run\ndiskutil list\nto get the current list of devices.\n\n*Insert your flash media.\n\n*Run\ndiskutil list\nagain and determine the device node assigned to your flash media (e.g. /dev/disk2).\n\n*Run\ndiskutil unmountDisk /dev/diskN\n(replace N with the disk number from the last command; in the previous example, N would be 2).\n\n*Execute\nsudo dd if=/path/to/downloaded.img of=/dev/rdiskN bs=1m\n(replace /path/to/downloaded.img with the path where the image file is located; for example, ./ubuntu.img or ./ubuntu.dmg).\n\n\n*\n\n*Using /dev/rdisk instead of /dev/disk may be faster\n\n*If you see the error dd: Invalid number '1m', you are using GNU dd. Use the same command but replace bs=1m with bs=1M\n\n*If you see the error dd: /dev/diskN: Resource busy, make sure the disk is not in use. Start the 'Disk Utility.app' and unmount (don't eject) the drive\n\n\n*Run\ndiskutil eject /dev/diskN\nand remove your flash media when the command completes.\n\n*Restart your Mac and press alt/option key while the Mac is restarting to choose the USB stick.\n\nHere's a link to ubuntu.com's instructions on burning a DVD on OS X using \"Disk Utility.\" \nhttp://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/burn-a-dvd-on-mac-osx\nImportant parts seem to be:\n\n\n*\n\n*Insert blank disk\n\n*Drag and drop your .iso file to the left pane in Disk Utility. Now both the blank disc and the .iso should be listed.\n\n*Select the .iso file, and click on the 'Burn' button in the toolbar.\n\n*Ensure that the 'Verify burned data' checkbox is ticked (you may need to click on the disclosure triangle to see the checkbox).\n\n\nAlso, the BurningIsoHowto link way above has this info on \"If the burning fails\":\nIf the CD writing fails, try writing at a slower speed. For better results, try the slowest burn speed reasonably possible. Most Gui tools have a \"Properties\" button to select speed but with Brasero those sorts of options appear after pressing the 1st \"burn\" button. This is the single most likely cause of problems but is much more widely known than Md5sum/SHA error-checking. Slower speeds ensure greater accuracy. \n\nA: \nThe disc inserted is not readable by this computer\n\nAs long as you followed the above burning a DVD on OS X, then this is normal. OS X doesn't recognize the bootable Ubuntu Live disk, but you still should be able to 'option boot' and select the live disk from there (it will probably be listed as 'EFI' or 'Windows').\n", "Q: How can I make a keyboard shortcut to turn off and turn on the screen?

Is it accurate? I'm working on a Javascript webapp and trying to figure out how to add documentation. It seems like the only option is to install something that lives on a server. I thought maybe I'd try JSDuck. It has a gem to be installed. So I  went to the Software Center and looked for Ruby to get the gem installer.\nWhen I found the package the most recent review was over six months old. It claims that either Ruby itself or the Ubuntu/Debian package has a virus. I find that hard to believe. However, in all this time no one has either confirmed or refuted it. Does anyone know for sure that the ruby1:1.9.3.4 package is safe?\n\nA: I couldn't find another way to locate the review rather than hack into the raw review  api for the ruby package. Here's that review (I've trimmed some of the metadata):\n\"rating\": 1, \n\"reviewer_username\": \"JmHGnMf\", \n\"usefulness_total\": 7, \n\"usefulness_favorable\": 0, \n\"summary\": \"Warning Virus (PUA)\", \n\"review_text\": \"Warning This Program Has A Virus!!!!!!!!!!

Where's the proof? Unsurprisingly none of the 7 people voting on this review found it useful. Username looks like junk too.\nGiven the lack of detail, I think somebody's trying to grief Ruby developers. I'd ignore it.\nI'm not saying that I've scanned Ruby and its dependencies. You are more than welcome to do that on a virtual machine if you really want to. I'm saying that I trust the Ubuntu development process more than one-liner Ray.\nTrusty's Ruby package gets security updates backported to it until April 2019. After then maybe I'll consider Ray's review worth listening to.\n\nA: I'd expect that review from \"Ray\" could be a false-positive from an over-zealous heuristic anti-virus scanner (likely run from windows). There are lots of anti-virus programs of wildly varying quality, I've read that some of them will even pop up false positives just to make it look like they're actually doing something.\nLots of malware disguises itself as anti-virus software too, probably pointing at random files and calling them viruses. I wouldn't be surprised if that could be the case either.\nThat is if it's not a \"revenge virus\" warning made up by \"Ray.\"\nAnd the source code should be available if you'd like to take a look for yourself, though that may be difficult (I might not spot any virus-like code even if it were staring at me ;-)\n", "Q: Thunderbird Mails (not enough disk space) I am using thunderbird mail and the partition in which mails are stored is of 470gb from which only 64gb is used.\nNow the problem is whenever i start thunderbird it generate a error message which says \"There is not enough disk space to download new messages.

Even emptying the Trash does not get rid of them. Instead they are marked for deletion and hidden from view. They are not physically removed until you \"compact\" the folder. This is a tradeoff done to improve performance in large folders. \n\nAnd the same site about file size limit:\n\nPrior to version 3.1 the maximum folder size is 4GB, or as limited by your file system [...]\n  Thunderbird 3.1 added a a 64-bit offset to the .msf file allowing imap folders larger than 4GB, if the file system permitted large files [...]\n  This change did not help non-imap folders, for example those in Local Folders, including any offline storage.\n\nSo pop email folders file size is still limited.\n", "Q: How to run gui application from web app?

Several years I notice that Ubuntu is lacking packages full descriptions. F.ex. Debian have this description for 'aptitude':\n\nPackage: aptitude (0.6.8.2-1)\nterminal-based package manager\naptitude is a package manager with a number of useful features,\n  including: a mutt-like syntax for matching packages in a flexible\n  manner, dselect-like persistence of user actions, the ability to\n  retrieve and display the Debian changelog of most packages, and a\n  command-line mode similar to that of apt-get.\naptitude is also Y2K-compliant, non-fattening, naturally cleansing,\n  and housebroken.\n\nUbuntu has this poor description:\nterminal-based package manager\n\nIt have happened since 'precise' release. 'trusty', 'utopic' and 'vivid' are affected too. What's wrong with the package description?\n\nA: Long story short, the long descriptions were removed from the core Packages files, no doubt to lower their file-size. Localised descriptions are shipped out in separate files and the main packages list only has a skimpy version, like:\nDescription: terminal-based package manager\n\nBut I'm British (en-GB) so when apt-get update happens, you can see it downloading translations for both US English and GB English:\nHit http://archive.ubuntu.com trusty-proposed/main Translation-en        \nHit http://archive.ubuntu.com trusty-proposed/main Translation-en_GB    \n\nBoth of these files have a separate localised version of the long description but the British trumps that colonial gobbledygook, so when I run apt-cache show aptitude on 14.04, I see:\nDescription-en_GB: terminal-based package manager\n aptitude is a package manager with a number of useful features, including:\n a mutt-like syntax for matching packages in a flexible manner, dselect-\n like persistence of user actions, the ability to retrieve and display the\n Debian changelog of most packages, and a command-line mode similar to that\n of apt-get.\n .\n aptitude is also Y2K-compliant, non-fattening, naturally cleansing, and\n housebroken.\n\nThat you're not seeing translations suggests that your language has no translation so it's just using the default one-liner from the main Packages list.\nYou can see a list of available translations in the relevant i18n directory listing. Have a look at yours. Confirm the missing translation and then do... Something. I'm honestly not sure what the process is for adding a new package translation.\nOr as muru suggests, you may have disabled translations.

Using a Ubuntu live iso/cd/usb, and with the old USB HD not even plugged in.\nThen with the new Ubuntu in the new HD & new computer working, you could move your $HOME from the old drive onto the new Ubuntu (if you want to keep your old settings).\nHere's a quick guide to copying an old home folder to a new one, https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Partitioning/Home/Moving#Copy_.2BAC8-home_to_the_New_Partition It's basically copy the files with the same permissions & owner (but the owner can be changed with chown later anyway). A file manager like Nautilus or Thunar or any one should work fine instead of rsync too.\nPlugging an old HD (with an old OS) into a new computer doesn't always work, the hardware differences could be too great.

I've read that ZFS is okay with cache drives failing and continues as normal off just the drives but it seems to not be persistent and raidz is not as flexible as md raid (changing raid types and growing the raid).

I think I broke this other Ubuntu (it was while ago, so I'm not sure), so booting external one is not an option.\nWhat folders/files should I copy to my machine, to get my saved files, progress etc. (like crown for win in campaign) in Battle for Wesnoth.\nI choose this one game because I can check if answer is right, and because I believe it's complicate enough, that everything else will work this way, but I would like to know general answer for problem like this. Is there any folder(s) which I can copy and be happy with terminator/emacs styles and plugins, TeX/LibreOffice fonts and dictionaries, Firefox/Chrome Bookmarks and pipelight? So LESS specific question, what should I copy form one Ubuntu instance to another, to get my preferences? I will check answer for specific Battle for Wesnoth, but would like to make question more open if possible.\n\nA: In linux, all your userdata is stored in you home, e. g. /home/user.  It's explained : here.\nFor BfW, there is an entry in the wiki.\nI guess, if you copy ~/.local/share/wesnoth/, it should work.  \n", "Q: Secondary display does not show complete screen I have Ubuntu 14.04, and am seeing an issue with my secondary display.\nFor some reason, it seems that on all 4 sides of the display, there are regions I cannot see. The picture stretches the entire screen but it's like it's zoomed into the center a bit, and I lose about the height of a title bar.\nIf I maximize something on the screen, it will maximize into these regions, so that, for instance, the top title bar of the window will be hidden from me.\nI tried taking a screenshot for this issue, but it shows nothing out of the ordinary.

If you had a DVD player connected via HDMI, you'd never notice the little bit missing from video playback, but for a computer desktop display it is essential that you see every pixel.\n", "Q: How do I resume an upgrade after pressing d for details in terminal?

How can I fix it without Ubuntu reinstall? I run Ubuntu 12.04.1 LTS x64 in VirtualBox. After one very unfortunate misclick (reset saved state instead of load saved state) I got a very annoying problem.\nAlmost all applications (unity, synaptic, gedit, etc.) print on start:\nUsing the 'memory' GSettings backend.  Your settings will not be saved or shared with other applications.\n\nAnd all GUI settings reset after reboot. \nAnother symptom:\n$ GSETTINGS_BACKEND=dconf dconf-editor\n(dconf-editor:2353): GLib-GIO-WARNING **: Can't find module 'dconf' specified in GSETTINGS_BACKEND\nGLib-GIO-Message: Using the 'memory' GSettings backend.

If that doesn't print /usr/bin/gsettings and instead something like /home/{username}/anaconda3/bin/gsettings you probably have something .profile/.bashrc/.zshrc like:  \nexport PATH=$HOME/anaconda3/bin:$PATH\nChange it to:\nexport PATH=$PATH:$HOME/anaconda3/bin\nAppending instead of preprending to the PATH variable will solve your issue, but be aware that anything in your system bin, or other PATH locations, will supersede your anaconda3/bin. \nAnother option would be to alias /usr/bin/gsettings:\nalias sys-gsettings=/usr/bin/gsettings\nsys-gsettings get org.gnome.todo view\n\n\nA: Just wanted to add my personal experience on this with ubuntu 16.10.

I then started getting the \"...using memory backend...\".\nDoing\nrm -rf ~/.gnome ~/.gnome2 ~/.gconf ~/.gconfd ~/.metacity .config/dconf/*\nsudo ldconfig\nsudo reboot\n\nFixed it for me.\n\nA: I've found the solution. It appears that I got several custom-built libraries in /usr/local/lib that \"shadowed\" system libraries from /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/. \nI discovered it by checking dynamic libraries loaded by libdconfsettings.so:\nldd /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/gio/modules/libdconfsettings.so\n\n...\n<  several dynamic libraries from /usr/local/lib >\n...\n\nIt happened because of the order of search paths for dynamic libraries (defined in /etc/ld.so.conf.d/).

On Ubuntu that file is provided by the dconf-gsettings-backend package; reinstalling that one should suffice (sudo aptitude reinstall dconf-gsettings-backend).\n\nA: This worked for me (and it does look like the same Python Anaconda issue raised by Dmitry).\n$ export GIO_EXTRA_MODULES=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/gio/modules/\n\n(It was causing me to be unable to change gsettings - particularly printer settings for Gedit.)\nSource:\nhttps://github.com/conda-forge/glib-feedstock/issues/19\n", "Q: hp mini 1110nr best version of ubuntu What version of Ubuntu would be good for a HP 1110nr mini netbook 1g memory 160g processor.\n\nA: The lightest of official Ubuntu versions is Lubuntu.\nAlso there is Ubuntu Netbook Edition specially designed for netbooks (discontinued currently). \n", "Q: Cannot create partition table on SSD I'm running into quite a dilemma, where I'm unable to create a new partition table on a particular SSD (Samsung 840 EVO). Attempting to create a msdos partition table via gparted doesn't work, and I've search high and low for an answer. Even tried diskpart from a Windows disc, but it would only indicate that the partition table is good and once I run up the installer, the installation fails (failed to create a partition). Installing and running Windows on the SSD works fine, and installing 14.04.1 on one of the HDDs in the system works, but not on the SSD.\nIn GParted is just indicates a warning that \"/dev/sda: unrecognised disk label\".

It turned out that in my BIOS (gigabyte fx990 ud3 rev 4.0) OnChip SATA Port4/5 Type was set to IDE instead of as SATA type.\nOnly the Samsung 840 EVO had the problem being run as IDE.\n\nA: If you're using Ubuntu, you can just use Disks (It's installed by default and on liveCD) to create a new partition table by formatting the whole drive. I've never used a Samsung SSD, but sometimes on Intel SSDs updating firmware can solve a lot of issues. \n", "Q: Can't type Korean any more after 14.10 upgrade Basically what the title says.

Well, I was upgrading my Ubuntu 12.04 to 14.04 and suddenly the power went off. I was in the installation stage and only a bit of it was done. Now when I boot into Ubuntu, it shows a command \nline that shows that it can't read the files or something. I please need to recover my system and\nmost importantly my files. Any help would be appreciated.\n\nA: If you boot off the bootable CD/USB & select the 'Try Ubuntu' option you will have a working system; plug the USB drive in, it should mount; you should also have an icon for your main (corrupted) drive, which you can double-click & it, too should mount. Assuming it does, you can navigate to your files & copy them safely to the USB drive.\nIf this goes OK, you'll almost certainly need to re-do the installation - I would unmount & disconnect the backup drive first. That's it.. \nIf you get permission errors, or something won't mount, open a terminal:\nsudo -i to get root permissions for all the next bit. \nIf drives mounted, skip over the following to Copying.\nmkdir /media/ubuntu/drive1 /media/ubuntu/drive2 - we need to create mount points. Then, we need to identify your drives:\ndmesg | tail will tell you where it put your USB drive - likely sdb or similar.\nYour main drive should be /dev/sda_ ; _ may be 1 if there's no Windows etc around.\nIf you're not sure, run fdisk -l /dev/sda which should list the partitions for you. You can probably work out which is your home directory by sizes if it's not obvious - that's the one we want. fdisk -l with no drive will list all drives on your system.\nOnce you're confident you have the right drives, (I'll use sda1 for your old files, sdb1 for the new USB - you use whatever you found..) type:\nmount /dev/sda1 /media/ubuntu/drive1\nmount /dev/sdb1 /media/ubuntu/drive2\n\nCopying:\nshopt -s dotglob if you want to keep hidden files, eg .gnupg/, .mozilla/ - better to do it than not.\ncp -R -preserve=all /media/ubuntu/whatever-it-called-your-old-drive/home/yourname/* /media/ubuntu/whatever-it-called-your-USB/   # This will take some time, but will copy all your files under your old userid, to your backup drive.\nWe now have the backup & can proceed to re-install to OS - unmount & disconnect the USB first.\nFinally:\nOnce the re-installation is done, you have a system with an almost empty home directory. Just copy some or all of your files back off the USB. If you use the shopt -s dotglob command it will take all your emails & passwords etc back over too; but may overwrite some system files, so I always take a (renamed) copy of the new blank home as well, just in case!\nIf the new installation assigned you a new userid, you may find you can't log in due to not owning your own files.\ncd /home/\nshopt -s dotglob\nsudo chown -R you:you you\n\nshould fix that.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 userdel -f does not remove user I faced with small difference in behavior of userdel utility on Ubuntu 10.04 and 14.04 and now struggling trying to fix it. \nI have kind of \"hardening\" script which should remove user via userdel utility. \nIt's a little bit ugly since it have to remove user which actually run this script.

(and tell the manager that you would not be able to have him commit suicide neither) \nSo from within the running user deluser or userdel doesn't work.

This has been frustrating.\nToday, december 2014, I own an Alienware 14, it uses an NVIDIA GK107M [GeForce GT 750M] and an Intel Corporation 4th Gen Core Processor Integrated Graphics Controller. It uses the optimus technology.\nI work a lot with openGL and I have not managed to install nvidia drivers other than nouveau and they are not even being recognized eventhough the module is loaded. \nAdditionaly my libmesa is giving me hell and in the event I get to compile an opngl application it shows a black screen where a month ago I could render pretty stuff.\nI have tried installing nvidia privative drivers and both registering them and not registering them in the dkms modules. I have blacklisted nouveau and even intel drivers.\nI am stuck in a dilemma. If I get to work with intel graphics, only openGL <= 3 will be supported and only if I get to work my nvidia card I will be able to work with openGL > 4\nI've been searching for days for this issues and have tried almost everything I can, I even reinstalled ubuntu. I've worked with linux ever since I own a computer and I don't want to work on windows just because of this. \nPlease help me.\n\nA: Well. Through a lot of investigation I found out this problem is at least 2 years old and in those 2 years a lot of very VERY smart cookies managed to make the optimus techonology work and make it easy for us plain regular human beings.\nI found a tutorial in french here \nIt works only for 13.10 and after.\nFirst uninstall anything that was garbage\nsudo apt-get purge bumblebee* primus libvdpau-va-gl1\n\ninstall nvidia-prime and the drivers and the mesa utilities\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-331 nvidia-prime mesa-utils\n\n*optional install drivers to watch hd videos\nsudo apt-get install vdpau-va-driver\n\nRestart machine\nchoose wether to use nvidia or intelgraphics in the nvidia-settings. This will have to be done manually all the time.\nOther information about Optimus here I found out nvidia is conencted to intel grpahics so in windows it changes automatically when needed to optimize battery life. \nThere is no automatic change in linux but at least you are able to change it manually. Now I can work with openGL 4 in my ubuntu. Now I need to be able to work wiht openGL 3 too.\n", "Q: Macrorecorder RemoteKeys in Ubuntu At work I use Windows7 and a very useful program called RemoteKeys. It's a macro manager like Actionaz. It can send complex keystrokes to another application using mouse clicks. \nhttp://www.softpedia.com/get/System/System-Miscellaneous/RemoteKeys.shtml\nI use it every day. You can make as many buttons to click as you want. It has several profiles. One of them is a keyboard. (Use Page Up to find the profile once the program is started.) If you click on a letter it should send the keystroke to for instance gedit (as active window).\nIn Ubuntu 14.04 (at home) I can start the program using wine, but nothing happens.\nI was wondering if there was a way to make it run under Ubuntu or explain why it can't work.\n\nA: Wine is not an emulator. And RemoteKeys is pretty old software that works by manipulating the Windows API and inserting itself in-between the application layer and the API using undocumented Windows calls.  \nAs Wine just emulates the documented Windows API, this kind of software doesn't work and will not ever work (even when you would file a bug report).\nYou would get the same kind of behaviour if you would try to install Norton Anti-virus from 15 years ago: It just wouldn't work...  ;-)\n", "Q: 14.04 LTS Ubuntu wifi stops working and disconnects after few minutes from rebooting I installed ( ubuntu 14.4 ) 2 days ago (it's important to mention I'm still a beginner).\nOn the first day my home WiFi worked fine, but on the second day and until now my WiFi stopped working and if I reboot, it works for about 5 minutes and disconnects again .\nEdit 2 : I've run the wireless script AGAIN when the WiFi is NOT working here \nand when working here \nWhen running a tail -f /var/log/{messages,kernel,dmesg,syslog} in one window and open an additional terminal and doing a sudo rmmod rtl8723be&&sleep 5&&sudo modprobe rtl8723be I get the following output\nEdit 2 : here's the tail again here\nHow should I proceed?\n\nA: As line 2 of your log output:\ntail -f /var/log/{messages,kernel,dmesg,syslog}\n\ncontains a \nCTRL-EVENT-DISCONNECTED bssid=d8:5d:4c:d5:52:47 reason=3 locally_generated=1\n\nand it happens about 5 minutes after log-on, I strongly believe it to be power-savings related.

I have an external HD that, when plugged in, is accessible at: /media/myusername/79039342-7793-4990-9eae-95ef3d4a9331.\nI figured out it's the drive called /dev/sdb (with a single partition in it sdb1).\nFine!\nThing is, it is not writeable.\nIf I try:\nsudo mount -o remount,uid=1000,gid=1000,rw /dev/sdb1\n\nI get:\n/media/myusername/79039342-7793-4990-9eae-95ef3d4a9331 not mounted or bad option\n\nSo the question is: how do I make it writeable?\n\nA: First, when it's auto-mounted, run mount and look for the /dev/sdb1 and see how it's mounted now. If there's a ro it's read-only, or a rw means you're almost done :)\nAnd a lsblk is a prettier way to see if & where drives are mounted too. sudo blkid may show some more useful info as well, possibly about FS types.\nIt may be mounted rw now, but the permissions won't let you write to it. May need to chown to get write permissions.\nOr if it is ro, try a basic sudo mount -o remount,rw /dev/sdb1, maybe it's erroring on the other options.\nIf that doesn't work, then my only other idea now is - is it a writeable filesystem? Or a ro-only system like squashfs or iso9660/cd format? gparted should show what partitions & FS's are what.\n\nA: First, I would unmount it.\numount /dev/sdb1\n\nThen, I'd remount it\nsudo mount /dev/sdb1 /home/user/driveb1 rw  0    2\n\nI would then check to be sure it was remounted\nmount\n\n", "Q: Running eBay TurboLister 2 on Ubuntu 14.04.1 with Wine?

This is my first time trying to use Linux.\nI have an Eee Pc Seashell series Asus netbook. I want to be able to play Minecraft on it and found some info on the net that suggested if I remove the Windows 7 OS and use Linux instead, that would leave enough resources on the computer to run Minecraft.\nI downloaded Ubuntu onto a USB drive and inserted that drive into the netbook and rebooted. This successfully wiped out the Windows OS but did not install Ubuntu. Basically turned the computer into a paperweight. Oddly enough, it also corrupted the USB drive too and when I went to another computer to try to delete the Ubuntu off of it and try something else, the computer would only read it as a wifi adapter. So, I purchased a new USB drive and this time loaded Lubunto 14.04.1 onto it. I used Universal USB Installer 1.9.5.8 to put the Lubuntu download onto the new USB drive. I then inserted that drive into my netbook and turned the netbook on. At first it seemed like it would work but then I got a string of text that ended with the error in the Title of this post. It seems stuck there. This happened when I tried to run the installer or \"try\" the OS (I guess this is called using the Live mode from what I see in installation instructions.)\nBecause the computer has no OS, I'm not seeing how I can try the other solutions to this error I've seen. Anyone have any solutions?\nThanks!\n\nA: Your PC has an Intel Atom processor and only 1GB of RAM, so Lubuntu was the right choice, but some of the Intel atom processors do not support PAE.\nSo follow the official Ubuntu PAE instructions and if that fails, you basically do have a pretty expensive doorstop.\n", "Q: Strange USB Hard Drive Behavior I'm currently experiencing strange behavior when using a new external usb hard drive that I believe that the behavior is related to a mount issue, a file system issue or actual hardware failure. It should help the community if I mention what I've done to correct the problem and what I've used to mount the usb hard drive.\nFile System\nThe USB hard drive was formatted in Ubuntu in a VM on my windows machine. It was then later moved to physical ubuntu server. \nUSB Mount\nI installed USB Mount using sudo apt-get install usbmount after which I then was able to browse the hard drive and write to it via /media/usb. \nAll good until...\nI got to around 20GB on the hard drive, there after I was getting failures via FTP when copying to the device. Now the strange problem is that when I use sudo cp filename and write to the device I get zero errors. The errors reported via Flashfxp are either disk full or error read/write input error.\nUsing Pmount\nRemoving USBMount and using Pmount does not resolve the issue other than I see /media/usb0 rather than just /usb/ Removing both pmount and usbmount I can still see /media/usb0/ which I found pretty odd.\nFdisk reports several problems\nThe below is a report from using fdisk as you can see it looks like I have no file system on sdb which is strange as I can view it.

Can you read & write to the entire drive?\nI've used external usb drive \"cases\" before, where you plug in a HD or cd/dvd drive, Ubuntu (Linux Mint) usually sees the HD's as /dev/sdc (for example) like a regular drive. No need for usbmount or pmount, but maybe yours is newer or weird somehow. Are there any others with the exact same drive who can (or can't) use it with linux (Ubuntu, debian, any)?\nAnyway, when it does get mounted, what is the format of the drive? Take a look with mount &/or lsblk. \nAny MBR or GPT? Your running fsck on the \"whole\" device /dev/sdb and not a partition like /dev/sdb1 (but fdisk doesn't appear to see any partitions anyway), but it can't see any ext2/3/4 FS there. Does fsck still balk when used on /dev/sdb1? And in general, it's best to run fsck on unmounted partitions.\nWith a USB hard drive, it's hard to tell if it's a software/driver problem, or the HD itself, or the external \"case\", or the USB cord or hub or plug... \n\nNew info: I may have overlooked (almost TL;DR ;-) a potentially interesting piece of info:\n\nThe USB hard drive was formatted in Ubuntu in a VM on my windows machine\n\nI haven't had good luck with VM's and usb (or any direct access to hardware) since everything goes through the VM program, that looks like a big suspect in the strange behaviour...\n\nA: As a good alternative to badblocks you can try diskscan ( from terminal:apt-get install diskscan). It measures the latency time of reading sectors and it also reports bad sectors. The longer the latency time the greater the probabilify of an error developing.\n", "Q: How can stop tab wrapping in terminal?

So it's not necessary that you use the password you set while installing slapd.\n\n*Use HDB unless you know otherwise. If you don't know what this is, HDB it is.\n\n\n*Since we don't have a database, pick yes.\n\n\n*Same here. Move it.\n\n\n*Do not allow v2 unless you know otherwise. If you don't know what this is, No it is.\n\nA base DN for whatever FQDN you entered will be created.\nYou can repeated sudo dpkg-reconfigure slapd to reset slapd and start over from scratch at any time. \n", "Q: How to change the location of Viber downloads folder Files transferred by Viber are stored on ~/Documents/ViberDownloads by default. How is it possible to change the destination to a location under ~/Downloads?\n\nA: This is a complimentary answer to AliNa's. \nIf you want to move your previously downloaded files to the new location follow below steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Backup your downloaded files\n\n*Backup .ViberPC folder\n\n*Open ~/.ViberPC/{your-phone-number}/viber.db with sqliteman\n\n*Paste below query to query edit area:\nUpdate messages set PayloadPath = replace(PayloadPath, \"Documents/ViberDownloads\", \".viberdownloads\") where PayloadPath is not null and PayloadPath <> '';\nWhat this does is; replaces text Documents/ViberDownloads with .viberdownloads in PayloadPath field of messages table. I typed \".viberdownloads\" because I wanted my downloads in /home/user/.viberdownloads folder. Change these strings according to your use.\n\n\n*Click Run(F9)\n\n\nMake sure you carefully backup .ViberPC folder, if something goes wrong you will lose all your message history on this machine.\n\nA: Viber preferences are stored as \".db\" files under ~/.ViberPC/. You should have installed an extra application in order to open or edit them; for example, Sqliteman which is available from Software Center.\nTo edit the location of downloads folder, open the following file:\n~/.ViberPC/{your-phone-number}/viber.db\n\nOn the left sidebar of Sqliteman, open Tables > Settings. You can see the setting entitled DownloadFolder on the bottom right. Double click on its value to change the location as you wish.\n\nIf you have downloaded some files before you change the setting, you won't be able to open them from Viber afterwards. To solve this, @HeyYo have a great answer.\n\nA: In OSX you can find ViberPC folder here /Users/<Username>/Library/Application Support/ViberPC\n\nA: The above didn't work for me (in version 6.5.5), so I temporarily fixed it by hacking the main viber binary, the sed below replaces ViberDownloads with .viberDownload:\nsudo -i\ncd /opt/viber\ncp -a Viber Viber.original\nhexdump -ve '1/1 \"%.2X\"' Viber.original | sed \"s/5669626572446F776E6C6F616473/2E7669626572446F776E6C6F6164/g\" | xxd -r -p > Viber\n\n", "Q: Can Ghost Tunes be a replacement for Ubuntu One?

I have only used windows so far, so I admit I'm a noob at ubuntu. \nSince I only need it for reading, writing papers, entertainment and communication, do you suggest upgrading to 12.10 or higher? Upgrade manager only shows 12.10 for upgrading. Does that mean that I have to upgrade gradually to reach the latest versions?\nI have to mention that security is a big deal to me as I have heard and read multiple times that ubuntu doesn't have significant virus threats present and that upgrading is the best way to protect my system (yeah yeah safe browsing too).\n\nA: The LTS in 12.04 LTS is supposed to mean Long Term Support, so it should get important updates like security updates for a \"Long Term\" (currently 5 years). You should be safe keeping 12.04 and just updating it, no need to upgrade to 12.10 or a newer version.\nThat said, the newer versions could offer newer features that 12.04 LTS may not have, like newer versions of programs (not just security & bigfix updates) or maybe even newer kernels with newer hardware support (someone correct me if I'm wrong there...)\nBut if everything works well on your 12.04 then keeping it is a fine idea.\n\nFYI, for more available software options, you can enable main, universe, restricted, and multiverse (I think they're separated by license type) in the \"Software Sources\" or \"Repositories\" See this link for more info https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories/Ubuntu\n", "Q: Can't install ubuntu on surface pro since keyboard/touch doesn't work I'm trying to install ubuntu on my microsoft surface pro and I'm having issues installing as it seems my bluetooth keyboard and touch aren't working at all. I created a bootable usb and was able to boot from it but once I get to the main selection I can't even select to install. The surface pro only has one usb port so I'm unable to plug in a corded keyboard. Is there any possible work around for this?\n\nA: I found that bluetooth keyboards worked fine and were my saving grace when I was installing ubuntu on my surface 2, so it may be your specific keyboard that is causing issues. Maybe try a different bluetooth keyboard?\nI was using a generically branded Adapt ADK-100 keyboard.\nAlternatively, you can try turning on the on screen keyboard. To do this, you'll need to boot into live mode, start the OSK from the accessibility settings, and then launch the install.\nIf you're using the microsoft surface keyboard, then it's not bluetooth, it uses their special side connector, and needs a kernel patch to get it to work (or did, the last few updates I've done haven't required a manual kernel rebuild, so we may now be ok).\nThe patch in question:\nhttp://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2183946&page=2&p=12844865#post12844865\nTo build and install this kernel patch, follow these instructions:\nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/BuildYourOwnKernel\nignore the fakeroot debian/rules editconfigs line, and at that point instead go and modify the files as per the ubuntu forums code block, then continue with the process.\n", "Q: What is Ubuntu Core? What exactly is Ubuntu Core, and how does it relate to Ubuntu itself (i.e. the main desktop and server distribution)? \nI've read the answer to this question, which says it's just a minimal install of Ubuntu, but it says nothing about the \"snappy\" transactional updates that Mark Shuttleworth mentioned in his blog post. \n\nA: This is the brief explanation of Snappy on the main Ubuntu site: (source)\n\nUbuntu Core is a new rendition of Ubuntu for the cloud with transactional updates. Ubuntu Core is a minimal server image with the same libraries as today’s Ubuntu, but applications are provided through a simpler mechanism. The snappy approach is faster, more reliable, and lets us provide stronger security guarantees for apps and users — that’s why we call them “snappy” applications.\nSnappy apps and Ubuntu Core itself can be upgraded atomically and rolled back if needed — a bulletproof approach to systems management that is perfect for container deployments. It’s called “transactional” or “image-based” systems management, and we’re delighted to make it available on every Ubuntu certified cloud.\n\n", "Q: Hard drive lock or bad drive? I received a laptop that didn't have a charger or OS. It would try booting from the Hard Drive but it would through \"Disk read error. Press Ctrl+Alt+Del to restart. The bios was locked with a password. I used a livecd and CMOSpwd to blank the bios password. When I tried to install ubuntu to the hard drive that came with the laptop it would fail. The install asks me to connect to the internet, I did, then the next screen checks for available space, powersupply, and internet connectivity. There was a green checkmark by the available space and power and internet. I told it to use the entire disk, but when I past that screen, it throws an error\ninput/output error during write on /dev/sdb\nI tried livecd-ing and running the fdisk -l command, nothing. I am currently using a 20GB hard drive in the laptop, so the cd works\nand so does everything else. I went into the manual partitioning option, I get ZERO errors when setting up the partitions. Manual setup \nyields the same input/output error. \nI know it sounds like a bad drive, but I have a bad drive that I tried using and I can't even get a green check mark by available space. So I \nam beginning to think that the harddrive is password protected like the BIOS were. How can I know for sure?\n\nA: Does sound like a bad drive, especially if you can literally hear it making funny noises (hear any?). Input/Output errors are generally fatal errors. You might be able to still read from some of the drive, but it probably won't get any better and will probably get worse. An encrypted drive would still be readable (assuming it's not some odd expensive hardware encryption, then you probably wouldn't be able to read & re-partition it at all).\nPartitioning may work ok if the start of the drive still works ok, but no guarantees about the rest of the drive.\nTrying to read through the whole disk with a program like testdisk (photorec specifically) may yield some interesting results of leftover files, but if it errors out too much that's another fed flag.\nAnd if you formatted the drive to ext3/4 you could try badblocks (with e2fsck -c or -cc) in case it's only a few bad sectors that could be avoided. More info from man badblocks and man e2fsck :\n   -c     This option causes e2fsck to use badblocks(8) program  to  do  a  read-only\n          scan  of the device in order to find any bad blocks.  If any bad blocks are\n          found, they are added to the bad block inode to  prevent  them  from  being\n          allocated  to a file or directory.  If this option is specified twice, then\n          the bad block scan will be done using a non-destructive read-write test.\n\n", "Q: Can I install Ubuntu on an HP R007TX? Can I install Ubuntu on an HP Pavilion R007TX notebook?\nAnd for that, from where I can get the drivers from HP that I'll need?\n\nA: You don't need any special drivers in Ubuntu like in Windows. Most features are supported by default without any external drivers.\nIf any extra proprietary drivers are needed the system will detect it itself and ask you to install.\nThere are a few sites that show Ubuntu compatibilty, for example:http://www.ubuntu.com/certification/desktop/models/?page=2&category=Desktop&category=Laptop&level=Any&query=hp+pavilion\n", "Q: 14.04: When changing the default desktop environment to to Gnome Flashback Compiz, and reboot I get a 'The system is running in low-graphics mode\" Following this tutorial, I managed to change the environment from \"unity-greeter\" to \"gnome-fallback-compiz\" and then I rebooted and I got this:\n\nYeah, and all the options are pretty much useless to me which means delete and install.

I can't boot my live Pendrive or the Ubuntu I just installed.\nSo I installed it with Legacy mode enabled (secure boot disabled) and when it was time to run boot-repair it showed me an error that the version was on Legacy mode and I needed UEFI mode. I can't seem to manage to boot Ubuntu and I've been searching around the web for a while now.\nAny help would be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: PLEASE, PLEASE, READ EVERYTHING FIRST. I DO NOT WANT TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR SEVERE DATA LOSS. IF YOU FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE WITH MY APPROACH, DON'T ADVENTURE YOURSELF.\nAssuming that you have backed-up everything that is on your laptop, I would follow the following steps. Make sure your read everything clearly before proceeding. This might result in an unstable Windows installation. I have a couple of suggestions to make.\n1) The first time I wasn't able to boot anything (Ubuntu and the USB pendrive) but Windows, I booted back to Windows and formated my USB to FAT32. If in doubt, use different USB drives (not all of them allow Ubuntu as a live system), if possible. Try to boot again after using the pendrive on windows. Also try uNetbootin, works everytime for me. If it is not working, you probably touched some \"vital\" settings in your BIOS (disk configuration, USB port allowing to boot from USB). Whenever you enter your BIOS, are you able to view your USB somewhere? (When you say that you are unable to boot on USB or Ubuntu, make your statement clearer).\nIf you are successful into booting Ubuntu from your USB, you could install it and WIPE your disk entirely THEN reinstall Windows IF, and only IF possible. If you don't know your BIOS activation key of Windows, search for software which will find it for you. IF you do not understand, do not proceed.\n2) My second advice would be that you repartition your disk straight from Windows (as it won't allow you to touch to Windows partitions (OS, recovery,...)). Make sure you leave some unallocated space equal to the amount of space you want to use to install Ubuntu. If not done, create your USB first. If you have a CD drive, buys DVDs (it is ANNOYING but saves your from so much trouble. I have lot's of experience when it comes to installing Ubuntu in the cleanest way possible) and burn DVDs of Ubuntu images. Boot from either the UBS or the DVD, and proceed with the installation. Now, this is when the hardest part comes in: selecting your installation mode.\n\nWhen you arrive to a step when you have to choose between ERASING your disk and SOMETHING ELSE, choose SOMETHING ELSE. Then, recognize the unallocated space you created in Windows. Create and ext4 file system out of it, format it (again :) and mount it as \"/\". If you want to add swap, add it. Add anything else you want to. Also! This is important if you boot in UEFI mode (USB or DVD). Make sure you have your efi partition on (the same used by Windows). Don't delete it! Don't format it, use it as EFI partition!\nInstall Ubuntu and you should be safe.\n3) Final solution. Throw all of you important data somewhere safe, WIPE your disk while installing Ubuntu and don't bother risking a Windows recovery partition's life!\nIn the worst case scenarios:\n\n\n*\n\n*You still can't boot from neither your USB/DVD/Ubuntu fresh install. That means you played in your BIOS;\n\n*You didn't play in the BIOS, you don't have a CD drive: ask a friend for a USB drive that works well;\n\n*Buy a cheap USB at least having 2GB of space storage. \n\n*If you still can't install Ubuntu, explain everything you observe while/as you try to install so it'll be easier to track down.

I recently tried to install Ubuntu (64bit) onto my Lenovo y510p. I partitioned 150GB of space, created a UEFI boot device with my flash drive, and was able to load into a live version of Ubuntu. My problem comes when I get to the install screen where it asks how it should install Ubuntu (by erasing the current disk, installing alongside, etc...). It doesn't give me the option to install alongside Windows. I tried the \"try something else\" option and attempted to select my free space partition but it said there was no root device and told me to fix it in the partition menu.

You see, when you installed Ubuntu, you almost certainly depended on that wireless connection for the internet access Ubuntu needs to install properly.  It probably worked just well enough to try and fail.  Fortunately you probably don't have to re-install.  You simply need to connect internet to it via an Ethernet cable and then attempt to update your computer.  When you open the system update screen, be sure to press CHECK to make sure it compares and updates.\nIf that doesn't fix your problem, please re-install Ubuntu but only with a wired connection.  I suspect it will download the correct drivers automatically and then the WiFi will work properly after that.\n", "Q: KDE power management could not be initialized on virtualbox I am using Virtualbox and I have Kubuntu as my first virtual machine,\nI was doing an upgrade (apt-get upgrade) when I suddenly closed my VM by mistake\nNo the problem is that I can no longer go past the log screen (where I write my password) because the screen become black and it says : \nKDE power management could not be initialized on virtualbox\n\nI am very new to Kubuntu but I know for a fact that it is because I stopped the upgrade,\nIs there a way to keep this VM? or I have to start a new one? because I have a very important project on it due for tomorrow and I don't want to work all night to redo it!\n\nA: In this situation, I would install an entirely different desktop manager, since the problem is apparently with KDE, and use that for 24 hours, and then fix the actual problem tomorrow.\nYou may already have one.

I think it's like a big file on a windows drive, that's used as your Ubuntu partition.\nWubi is no longer a recommended method, and it doesn't work with Windows 8 at all.\nTo fix it, you could resize the wubi \"install\", but it's probably a better solution to migrate wubi to a regular install by following this Ubuntu guide here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MigrateWubi\nAnd even more Wubi info here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/WubiGuide Especially check out:\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I migrate to a real partition, and/or get rid of Windows entirely? \n\n*How do I resize the virtual disks?\n", "Q: Extending Python lightblue module to use multiple bluetooth dongles I'm using the lightblue module and pybluez to send files via bluetooth to obex protocol object push. But I need to use multiple bluetooth dongles (3 and more) to send files to multiple devices (20 and more) at the same time.\nI need to tell lightblue to use a specific hcix and use it to connect and send.

PyBluez internally uses the Linux bluetooth sockets functionality, so it depends on whether that allows sockets to be created for a specific HCI device. My guess is that it doesn't, else this functionality would have been exposed in the PyBluez API, but it would be worth checking. If it's possible, then obviously PyBluez and lightblue could be changed to allow as well.\n", "Q: I can barely see the scroll bar I can’t get the scroll bar to show on this system.

If that is the case, merely move the window by using Alt and a left click.  That will enable you to see the whole window.  I have been living with windows that do not fit ever since installing Lubuntu on my netbook.  Some applications fit or adapt to the smaller screen other applications do not.\n\nA: As you are asking about Lubuntu, which I'm only somewhat familiar with, I can't be certain it's not particular to that OS, but it seems to me that if placing your mouse at the far right hasn't made one appear, and you don't see one already, that could be that your screen size is mismatched to your monitor and you simply cannot see it.\nScreen size mismatches rarely seem to occur in laptops, I most often see it on exotic external displays, projection display monitors and very small netbooks.\nIf you are using an external display (not a laptop), please press the auto-adjust button on the monitor if it has one.  \nAnother option is to go into settings - displays and see if selecting other resolutions will cause the screen image to fit your monitor properly.\n", "Q: how to using dropbox-cli?

If you want to, you can go ahead and reboot instead.\nYou should also take a look at these:\nSwitching window manager/desktop environments?\nHow to remove Plymouth Boot Animation manager and keep the default boot screen\nhttp://ubuntuhandbook.org/index.php/2014/04/reset-unity-and-compiz-settings-in-ubuntu-14-04/\n\nA: From my experience, Ubuntu freezes only when it is about to have nothing opened. To fix that I first opened terminal (Control+ALT+T) then opened the software center (don't minimize anything yet!!!) then I got the screenlets app. The I opened screenlets, chose the one I liked and clicked \"start/stop\" and \"start on startup\" tickboxes on the bottom left of the screenlets app. Then I close everything and the screenlet was on the desktop. Since the screenlet was opened Ubuntu didn't freeze, since there was a thing opened. \n\nA: Most likely the problem is nautilus crashing as nautilus is responsible for the desktop items. Try out the following solutions if anything works out :\nTry removing the nautilus config files\nrm -rf ~/.nautilus\n\nIf it doesn't work out , remove nautilus open terminal\nsudo apt-get purge nautilus-open-terminal\n\nIf nothing works, until the fix comes around,  just open nautilus before minimizing the last open window.

Write this to a large dump file and use something like tcpstat to extract the total length. Another one: have your socket program itself calculate the amount of data sent and received at the socket level, and work out the IP and ethernet or other link layer overhead to get the amount of data on the line.

You want to look at the user_interface.c file. You're looking for anything that uses keyval. You can see when it's being matched against CLUTTER_... keys and the comments help work out what it does.\nFor subtitles, V seems to be your key. See ~L413:\ncase CLUTTER_v:\ncase CLUTTER_V:\n{\n  // toggle subtitles\n  if (toggle_subtitles (ui->engine)) {\n    gtk_clutter_texture_set_from_pixbuf (GTK_CLUTTER_TEXTURE\n        (ui->subtitle_toggle),\n        gdk_pixbuf_new_from_file (ui->subtitle_active_png, NULL), NULL);\n  } else {\n    gtk_clutter_texture_set_from_pixbuf (GTK_CLUTTER_TEXTURE\n        (ui->subtitle_toggle),\n        gdk_pixbuf_new_from_file (ui->subtitle_inactive_png, NULL),\n        NULL);\n  }\n\n  handled = TRUE;\n  break;\n}\n\nI can't see anything that suggests it would let you change the aspect. It merely displays in the same format as the source video.\n\nA: Limited idea of an answer.\nMaybe a way would be to use the terminal commands through the context menu, for example in Nautilus with Nautilus-Actions.\nsnappy -h says: -t, --subtitles            Use this subtitle file\nSo, then in nautilus-actions:\n\nAnd limiting that to specific files\n\nWhen selecting both the video and the subtitle file and right-clicking, the new nautilus action will start the video in Snappy with subtitles.\n(But I don't think the display of the subtitles is editable.

Everything works just fine, most of time my RAM usage shows around 700 MB. However every week or so at random time Server goes out of memory and crashes. It recovers and start all service except Mysql. \nI found that I don't have swap memory, so I create 256MB swap file and configure it. It works fine, but still crash this time after 2 weeks. \nI am no expert as you already figured it out. So, I want some guidance on why in normal operation my server is taking so much Memory. I mean I observe it at different time, it is always around 700-800MB Memory and Load is stable. there is not cron that run at night or something. I have couple of wordpress blog, but they have stable load and never see any \"bulk\" load. \nI do have Vesta Control Panel, and all reports are normal that I know off. One thing that however  I notice is that Apache always shows 1900MB of Memory consumption where as my system in total have lower memory. I have nginx installed reverse web server[not sure what does that mean by vesta did it for me]. everything else is good just apache is all the time at 1900MB. and it seems that when this usage increase it crash the server. \nSo, is there a way I can bring down that usage of apache? What else are measure I should do to make my server stable with current load. \nEDIT:\nBased on suggestion here is my MPM Configuration\n<IfModule mpm_prefork_module>\n    StartServers          8\n    MinSpareServers       5\n    MaxSpareServers      20\n    ServerLimit         256\n    MaxClients          200\n    MaxRequestsPerChild 4000\n</IfModule>\n\nand here is my apache2ctl -l \nCompiled in modules:\n  core.c\n  mod_log_config.c\n  mod_logio.c\n  prefork.c\n  http_core.c\n  mod_so.c\n\nThough I mention before, but I am running Wordpress (PHP) based blogs on server, there is Redmine (Ruby on Rail) as well that runs using Nginx and apache in same way as other website. No, i don't use python. \n\nA: With Apache prefork MPM configured with a ServerLimit of 256 you've configured it for a maximum memory usage of about 256 processes, roughly 15-30 MB of memory each in a typical PHP5 Apache module. Do the math and you know it will explode on a small server with a high number of clients.\nInstead, configure it with much tighter limits. E.g.\n<IfModule mpm_prefork_module>\n    StartServers          5\n    MinSpareServers       5\n    MaxSpareServers      10\n    ServerLimit         25\n    MaxClients          20\n    MaxRequestsPerChild 4000\n</IfModule>\n\nRestart Apache to use the new MPM configuration.\nThis will make Apache start with 5 processes, ensures it has 5 processes free for new incoming clients, shut down processes only if more than 10 are unused and a hard limit of 25. Adjust to your needs.\nAlternatively, look into the option of using PHP-FPM rather than PHP as an Apache module. That's a lot more efficient and also the default configuration for Ubuntu 14.04. Please note that you will have a separate PHP process pool and you will not be using the Apache prefork MPM then (and the exact reason for why it's more efficient). \nJust read up on regular Ubuntu/Apache/PHP-FPM documentation how to configure all this.\n\nA: Having mysql and apache on one server is a REAL bad idea. The more users you have, the more access you have to the data base, which also uses cpu and mem to work of course. So you tell the apache to query and query, the users get impatient, reload the pages maybe, even more queries. You know where I'm getting right? In your case it is not only apaxhe but mysql which needs to use the same sparse ressources.\nI tell you what, don't use an apache (cannon) to kill a bird (80 users).\nGo nginx(-npm), more light-weight, doesn't eat up that much ressources.\nMost ppl don't understand that apache CLAIMs the ressources for POSSIBLE connect (hence the tip to lower that)\nThis program is written to serve pages at any time. So it will take the ressources (even if there are no connections, to show for it) an keep them alive. Sorry I'm not a native english speaker so I hope I could explain it in a way you understand. Short version 80 user and apache do not match on a small vhost! Use nginx, this should fix your problem, else move the db to another small server.\n", "Q: unable to mount external hard disk error coming when inserting the hard disk, following error is coming\nError mounting: mount: unknown filesystem type 'exfat'\nplease help.\n\nA: You need to get the exfat utilites first.

This means less forking out and for small operations, can mean a substantial speedup.\nHere's a performance demo catting 10,000 empty files.\n$ mkdir testdir\n$ touch testdir/{0000..9999}\n\n$ time find testdir/ -type f -exec cat {} \\;\nreal    0m8.622s\nuser    0m0.452s\nsys     0m8.288s\n\n$ time find testdir/ -type f -exec cat {} +\nreal    0m0.052s\nuser    0m0.015s\nsys     0m0.037s\n\nAgain this only works on commands that can take multiple filenames. You can work out if your command is like that by looking at its manpage. Here's the synopsis from man cat:\nSYNOPSIS\n       cat [OPTION]... [FILE]...\nThe ellipsis on [FILE]... means it can take more than one file.\n+ can only be used on single commands and you must have exactly one {} in the line. \\; can operate with multiple zero-to-many groups.\n", "Q: What is taking up 320 seconds on my bootup?

Easiest way is to create a local user configuration in ~/.ssh/config with these two lines:\nHost *\nUser ctote\n\nThis matches all hosts and applies the login name ctote to it.\nTo apply/override it for a single host you connect to ofen, use for example:\nHost myhost\nUser myusername\nHostname server01.subdomain01.longnamehuh.tld\nPort 2222\n\nto make\nssh myusername@server01.subdomain01.longnamehuh.tld -p2222\n\ninto\nssh myhost\n\nBonus: also works for sftp/scp/git etc. And you can also do magic like this use case: How do I SSH to machine A via B in one command?.\nHave a look at the manpage of SSH client configuration for more options you can specify and what the syntax is exactly.\nman ssh_config\n\n\nA: Sure, you can create a ~/.ssh/config file and in that:\nHost laptop\n    User another-user\n\nYou can specify most SSH options through host-matched options like this.\n", "Q: Problems appending lines from a script I'm writing a script and here's how i'm inputting into the CurrentOutput.csv file.\necho \"$col1,$col2\" >> CurrentOutput.csv \n\n\nInput.txt\n1.2.3.4\n2.3.4.5\n3.4.5.6\n\nCurrentOutput.csv\n1.2.3.4\n,DNS1\n2.3.4.5\n,DNS2\n3.4.5.6\n,DNS3\n\nDesiredOutput.csv\n1.2.3.4,DNS1\n2.3.4.5,DNS2\n3.4.5.6,DNS3\n\n\nI've tried echo -e \"$col1,$col2\\c\" and echo -n \"$col1,$col2\".

First of all, im pretty comfortable with command line but by no means an linux expert so I would appreciate some detail in any answers you give if possible. Thanks!!\nI am trying to set up a file server running Ubuntu 14.04. I have a folder /files and within that I will be creating a few folders that will all be shared with different permissions. I have samba running and can access the shares from machines on my network. I have changed the the owner of the files directory to be my admin user and a new group I have created, for simplicity ill call it mygroup.\nI have chown'd the /files directory to myuser:mygroup and then created new users in Ubuntu and added them to mygroup as there primary group. I have also chmod'd the files directory to 770 so that both my admin user and mygroup have full write access. I then have samba users for each group and allowed them access to my shares in samba (im using a GUI by the way but happy to get stuck in with command line if I have to).\nAll of this so far is good, my users can connect to the samba shares from both mac and windows and they can even create directories. \nThe problem is, if a user creates a new directory within the share, it is created with 755 permissions meaning that other users in mygroup can read and execute but cannot write to that directory. \nI have read up about ACL and have run the following command against the /files directory:\nsetfacl -m \"g:mygroup:rwx\" /files/\n\nThen if I run:\ngeftacl /files/ \n\nI can see group:mygroup:rwx in the list, and the same is true if I test the subfolders of /files. As far as I am aware, this should set the permissions for any new files being created within that directory to at least be x7x?\nI have also seen within smb.conf the create mask and directory mask settings, I have tried changing these to be 0775 (and uncommented them) but it is still created with the same permissions.\nCan anyone recommend anything else to try?\n\nA: You want to change the users' umask\nThere is an answer describing it here.\nTL;DR\n$ umask 007\n\nfor each user.\n", "Q: Recommended usb wifi adapter with hotsopt support i'd like to setup a wireless hotspot in ubuntu and would like to know what brands/models have master mode support.\n\nA: The TL-WN722N is one of the least expensive dongle wifi cards that support master mode.\nI have purchased one online before and paid $13 USD, including shipping.\nThere is a resource here where a user describes being able to achieve master mode using hostapd.

I wanted to use brcsmac but I didn't know how to switch, everything I tried remained with b43. I think this https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Driver/bcm43xx# also says to me to use the b43 with this \"BCM4311 [14e4:4312]\" (so is it 11 or 12??) \nStep 2 install wpasupplicant and packages needed for manual wifi connect...\n# I've learned I need this\n# because I have a WPA network, WPA PSK 2 type, and from command line I use wpasupplicant \nsudo apt-get install wpasupplicant\n# just in case, for iw, iwconfig, ...\nsudo apt-get install wireless-tools\n\nStep 3 install the firmware recommended at http://wireless.kernel.org/en/users/Drivers/b43#devicefirmware and then reboot!\nsudo apt-get purge bcmwl-kernel-source\nsudo apt-get purge firmware-b43-installer\nsudo apt-get install firmware-b43-installer\nsudo rmmod b43\nsudo rmmod ssb\nsudo modprobe b43\nsudo reboot\n\nStep 4 manually connect to wifi\n# to see which phy, phy0 or phy1 -- is there a better way????\ndmesg | grep -i -e b43\n# to see which interface, wlan0 or wlan1?\niw dev\n# decided to go with wlan1\n# to see if it's \"Hard blocked: yes\"? or \"Soft blocked: yes\"?\nrfkill list\n# to unblock\nsudo rfkill unblock wifi\n\nNote this is the point where I would expect NetworkManager to stop being \"grayed out\", however it is remains \"grayed out\" and that is :(. To go on with the story,\n# to check the interface wlan1 exists...\niwconfig\n# to see if interface wlan1 is up\nifconfig\n# if not, to see if it sees it\nifconfig -a\n# to bring interface wlan1 up\nsudo ifconfig wlan1 up\n# to re-check if wlan1 is up\nifconfig\n# if yes, go on...\n# to see which networks are available\n\nStep 5 to connect to my network 'foonet'\nsudo iw dev wlan0 scan | grep -i -e ssid\n# I see it sees my network called foonet\n# I know foonet is WPA protected, WPA 2 PSK ...\n# creates a file that stores more than just my password for wifi network:\nwpa_passphrase foonet >wifi_password_for_foonet.conf\nI write here my password for foonet then press Enter (return) once\n\n# to connect to the network using the file just created\nwpa_supplicant -Dwext -iwlan1 -c wifi_password_for_foonet.conf\n# it stoles my temrinal from me so I have to go to another terminal\n# I go to another terminal\n# I remember painfully, that I need to do this\nsudo dhclient wlan1\n# if it fails, then first: sudo dhclient -r wlan1       -- then retry without -r\n# now it works for me and I post this! \n\nSo now I have this manually working from terminal. My problem I would like this to work from the gui so my friends can handle the wifi networks from the gui on the go.\nBut in Networkmanager, all wifi is grayed out: grayed out BCM4311, says it is hardware blocked (rfkill says phy1 is not), grayed out RTL8188CE, says it is hardware blocked (rfkill says the same for phy0), grayed out \"Enable Wi-Fi\". Even if I got it working manually.\nI found a hardware switch at the back of the computer I turned wifi ON. The switch is moved to be at the closest to an wifi icon that shows a computer sending broadcasts. \nOn the front panel, there are two glowing green wifi-like icons. A triangle broadcasting signals - to the left, it glows. The same icon inside a rectangle - to the right. If I press Fn+F5 the left icon stops glowing, goes off. And my manual wifi also stops. If I press Fn+F5 again it starts glowing again. My manual wifi comes back, but I also have to re-do dhclient -r wlan1 and dhclient wlan1 to make it work again. The other icon glows all the time. \nI would like fix networkmanager or other more automatic and gui-discoverable way to enable my friends to use the computer with any network without me or rememberin the terminal stuff. But I don't know how. I don't know why it doesn't work or how should I further troubleshoot. So how can I fix NetworkManager or equivalent so wifi can be handled the way my friends can use it?\nappendix\nlspci -nnk\n03:00.0 Network controller [0280]: Broadcom Corporation BCM4311 802.11a/b/g [14e4:4312] (rev 01)\n    Subsystem: Hewlett-Packard Company Broadcom 802.11a/b/g WLAN [103c:1360]\n    Kernel driver in use: b43-pci-bridge\n04:00.0 Network controller [0280]: Realtek Semiconductor Co., Ltd.

Repeat for each bad block number listed in the file.\nMake sure to type the commands exactly as shown ( substituting the block number for the #### ) or you can destroy your data\nYou also might want to run sudo smartctl -a /dev/sda to read the SMART status of the drive.  Of note are the raw values for the reallocated count and pending.  If you fixed all of the bad sectors, the pending count will have returned to zero.  If they were remapped, the reallocated count will have gone up.  If this is more than a handful you probably want to replace the drive as it is likely to get worse.

And if so, what does it exactly requiere to do so I can install it?\n\nA: Personal speaking, I've made the experience that r8168 works better on various RTL81XX chips than r8169\nPackages installed using APT automatically satisfy all dependencies. So everything required is installed when the package is being installed.\nYou need, however, prevent r8169 from being loaded after r8168 is installed. The DKMS installation script of r8168 unloads r8169, but it may be reloaded after a reboot.   Thus, open the file /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf (or create, if it doesn't exist) as root and append the line\nblacklist r8169\n\nto prevent the module to be loaded again. Ensure that there's a new line at the end of the file, then save and quit.\nYou can check whether the driver was loaded correctly using lsmod | grep r8168. If it doesn't return anything, the driver isn't loaded. In this case you can load it with sudo modprobe r8168 after you installed it. If it lists the driver module, it's loaded. If you encounter problems with r8168, you can temporarily switch back to the other module by manually loading it: sudo modprobe -r r8168 && sudo modprobe r8169.\n\nIMPORTANT: Note that the driver source on Realtek's website is more current than the one in Ubuntu's repositories.

I found many questions about how to open the terminal but cant find a question with an answer on how to close the terminal and return back to the desktop of Ubuntu (note: I am on virtual machine)\n\nA: You can type exit. You can type ctrl-d. Or (if you're on a virtual terminal), you use ctrl-alt-F8.\n\nA: ctrl + shift + w closes the current tab and ctrl + shift + q closes the entire window.\nAlso, \nexit\n\nThis is similar to other commands that also are normally ctrl + whatever such as, ctrl + c and ctrl + v for copy and paste which, in gnome-terminal are, ctrl + shift + c and ctrl + shift + v respectively.\nI'm not sure if the following works in a virtual machine, however, it is important to also note that when you switch to a tty text session such as tty1 - tty6 using ctrl + alt + f1 up to ctrl + alt + f6, you can return to the regular desktop xsession by pressing ctrl + alt + f7 typically or sometimes ctrl + alt + f8.\n\nA: TL;DR: Press Alt+F7.\nYou are apparently asking how to close a virtual console, also known as a virtual terminal--a full-screen text terminal you got to by pressing a key combination like Ctrl+Alt+F1, Ctrl+Alt+F2, and so forth.\nIn infer this since you say you wish to \"return back to the desktop of Ubuntu\" (indicating you are not on your desktop now) and, in a comment, wrote:\n\nmy terminal in virtual machine is at a black background and when i type exit it refreshes its not a program ...\n\nRather than actually closing your text-based virtual console, you probably just want to get back to the virtual console on which the graphical user interface is running. This is usually the seventh virtual console, so press Alt+F7. (Ctrl is optional when switching from a virtual console that does not have the GUI running on it; however, you must use it when switching from a virtual console that does have the GUI running on it.)\nIf those key combinations do not work--or change the virtual console of the host rather than the guest--and your Ubuntu system is a VirtualBox guest system, see How do I switch between virtual terminals in a guest system? as suggested by LiveWireBT.\nAnother way, which is much less often used, is to run the command chvt 7.\n", "Q: How do I find a manual (user Guide) for Ukopp?

Install it correctly by running sudo ./install from the directory containing the install script (are you installing from a .iso file, or do you have a CD or an installation archive from Mathworks?). Then you can simply create a symbolic link to the new installation location, or add an alias in your .bashrc file with the new installation path (by default it should be /usr/local/MATLAB/R2015b/matlab ).

The 300 second waiting period is specified in /etc/init.d/sendsigs, which is a shutdown script that attempts to kill remaining processes that have not successfully ended in previous parts of the shutdown sequence. Find the following code in the script:\nif [ $seq -ge 300 ] ; then\n   break\nfi\n\nThis is where the 300 second maximum wait time is specified. Change 300 to a desired number of seconds greater than 10 (other parts of the script already specify a wait time of 10 seconds). You will need to use sudo to change this file, since it does not have write permissions for an ordinary user.\nThis is a very heavy-handed tactic, and it's not a good long-term solution. If you have network file storage which might be hanging at shutdown, or if any other process (ie. mySQL) might be legitimately waiting at shutdown, do not follow this method. But for a laptop or general purpose computer with a standard software configuration, it will at least allow you to shutdown and restart without waiting 5 minutes every time.\n\nA: try this\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall ubuntu-desktop\nsudo apt-get install unity\n\nor try\nsudo shutdown -h now\n\nA: Do you have the Plank installed?\nI had the same problem, after install the Plank dock and set it to start with the system.

The workaround for this problem is just add a time delay to this startup program.\nGo to the terminal and type:\ncd  ~/.config/autostart/\ngedit plank.desktop\n\n(replace \"plank\" for the name of your autostart file)\nLook for the follow line:\n\nX-GNOME-Autostart-enabled=true\n\nAnd replace for:\n\nX-GNOME-Autostart-Delay=13\n\nAfter that, logout, login and check if it works.\nSee ya! ;-)\n\nA: I had the same problem with Kubuntu 14.10. My solution was:\n\n\n*\n\n*I changed this line in file /etc/default/grub to look like this: GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash init=/lib/systemd/systemd\"\n\n*After that, I ran sudo update-grub in a Terminal\nNow the system shuts down again...:-)\n", "Q: Checking for a file and whether it is readable and writable I'm trying to write a script that will look for a certain .txt file saved to my desktop.

There are several sections.\nThe first section allows you to select the font from a set of alternatives:\nDefault (fontdefault)\nSet the font to the default, i.e., that given by the *VT100.font resource.\nUnreadable (font1)\nSet the font to that given by the *VT100.font1 resource.\nTiny (font2)\nSet the font to that given by the *VT100.font2 resource.\nSmall (font3)\nSet the font to that given by the *VT100.font3 resource.\nMedium (font4)\nSet the font to that given by the *VT100.font4 resource.\nLarge (font5)\nSet the font to that given by the *VT100.font5 resource.\nHuge (font6)\nSet the font to that given by the *VT100.font6 resource.\nEscape Sequence\nThis allows you to set the font last specified by the Set Font escape sequence (see the document Xterm Control Sequences).\nSelection (fontsel)\nThis allows you to set the font specified the current selection as a font name (if the PRIMARY selection is owned).\nThe second section allows you to modify the way it is displayed:\nBold Fonts\nThis is normally checked (enabled). When unchecked, xterm will not use bold fonts. The setting corresponds to the allowBoldFonts resource.\nLine-Drawing Characters (font-linedrawing)\nWhen set, tells xterm to draw its own line-drawing characters. Otherwise it relies on the font containing these. Compare to the forceBoxChars resource.\nPacked Font (font-packed)\nWhen set, tells xterm to use the minimum glyph-width from a font when displaying characters. Use the maximum width (unchecked) to help display proportional fonts. Compare to the forcePackedFont resource.\nDoublesized Characters (font-doublesize)\nWhen set, xterm may ask the font server to produce scaled versions of the normal font, for VT102 double-size characters.\nThe third section allows you to modify the way it is specified:\nTrueType Fonts (render-font)\nIf the renderFont and corresponding resources were set, this is a further control whether xterm will actually use the Xft library calls to obtain a font.\nUTF-8 Encoding (utf8-mode)\nThis controls whether xterm uses UTF-8 encoding of input/output. It is useful for temporarily switching xterm to display text from an application which does not follow the locale settings. It corresponds to the utf8 resource.\nUTF-8 Fonts (utf8-fonts)\nThis controls whether xterm uses UTF-8 fonts for display. It is useful for temporarily switching xterm to display text from an application which does not follow the locale settings. It combines the utf8 and utf8Fonts resources.\nUTF-8 Titles (utf8-titles)\nThis controls whether xterm accepts UTF-8 encoding for title control sequences. It corresponds to the utf8Fonts resource.\nInitially the checkmark is set according to both the utf8 and utf8Fonts resource values. If the latter is set to “always”, the checkmark is disabled. Likewise, if there are no fonts given in the utf8Fonts subresources, then the checkmark also is disabled.\nThe standard XTerm app-defaults file defines both sets of fonts, while the UXTerm app-defaults file defines only one set. assuming the standard app-defaults files, this command will launch xterm able to switch between UTF-8 and ISO-8859-1 encoded fonts:\nuxterm -class XTerm\nThe fourth section allows you to enable or disable special operations which can be controlled by writing escape sequences to the terminal.

I have two identical desktops running Ubuntu server 14.04. During the install process I only selected Ubuntu server, no other packages.\nDesktop #1) This was my first linux build, and so fumbled around quite a bit until I figured it out. I configured the WPA_Supplicant.conf file utilizing the wpa_passphrase program, can can connect fine using wpa_supplicant. I can then get an ip using dhclient, or assign a static address in wpa_supplicant.conf... I also successfully configured the /etc/network/interfaces file .. first to connect via DHCP, then changed it to connect to a static IP. So.. for desktop #1 it works perfect.. connecting to my wireless network via WPA_supplicant manually, or automatically utilizing /etc/network/interfaces on boot.\nDesktop #2) This is the problem machine. It is the same model, and same wireless card. I have successfully created the WPA_Supplicant.conf file, and can connect manually by running wpa_supplicant, then of course get an address via dhclient. It works great!!!! However, for the life of me, I can't connect automatically on logon with /etc/network/interfaces. It just doesn't connect!

I have 8GB of RAM, but sometimes I'm running a couple VMs and enough Chrome processes to use up most of my memory.  That's usually fine, but sometimes my system starts thrashing, and it's difficult for me to recover from it without just waiting for things to get better since the UI is mostly frozen.\nIn all of these cases, the programs using most of my RAM could be deprioritized.  If Chrome or the VM became nonresponsive but my graphical environment and terminal were still responsive, I could switch over to a terminal, find the culprit, and kill it.  I could imagine something like a \"nice\" for memory (so that I could nice Chrome and my VM) or something to force the graphical environment and my terminal to stay in memory and not to swap.\nIs there a way to ensure that the UI remains responsive when my system is thrashing?\nThanks!\nEDIT:  I'm still interested in whether there's something like a nice for memory, but I just discovered that my sistem doesn't have any swap space.  I think that this happened because I started using an encrypted home and encrypted swap (see Swap not working on clean 14.04 install using encrypted home).  So, my system is probably becoming unresponsive because I don't have any swap space, so my system can't swap out unnecessary programs when it gets low on memory.\n\nA: \nI just discovered that my sistem doesn't have any swap space\n\nIf this is true, then it's probably contributing to the problem.\nBy using multiple VMs with large memory allocations, an amount of RAM that would normally be more than enough for normal use (8GB) starts becoming tight, which means your system won't be able to use as much cache, and will want to swap.  Now, if you don't have swap, there will be even more pressure on memory and you may even get tasks killed due to running out of memory.\nSwap tries to improve overall stability and performance in situations like the one you have described, by re-allocating some allocated but seldom-used data in memory to disk, freeing memory for data you are using.  Adding swap, if you indeed have none, will help.  However, in performance terms you'll make much more improvement if you also buy more RAM, or use less of it.\nOn a system where you're running VMs but you're also using a regular desktop on the VM host, you don't want your VMs to take up all your RAM, in fact I'd save half your RAM (up to 4GB) for the host, given you're running software on the host and want it to be responsive.\nNote too that VMs have inherent inefficiencies not just because their RAM is totally separate they don't share any cache or buffers, but they are running a whole separate OS under a number of layers of abstraction.  So you can always get better efficiency if you decide to run something on the host rather than in a VM - though if your purpose for using VMs is to use other operating systems this won't be possible.\n\nIs there a way to ensure that the UI remains responsive when my system is thrashing?\n\nWhen the amount of RAM you have is a problem, anything you can do is only a hack - the real solution is to buy more RAM (although in your case as I mentioned you may be able to just allocate less to the VMs).\nYour question is put in simple terms - you want the UI to be able to continue to operate smoothly even if IO is congested.  However, it's complicated to answer.  Your system will already be doing this to the best of its ability: operations that don't require disk access won't be being delayed.  If your \"UI is stuttering\" it's because the particular process responsible for that UI needs disk access.  In a low memory situation and where the disk is thrashing, even something which will normally be trivial - such as reading some config from your home directory to find out what your display preferences are - can be slow due to depletion of disk cache.\n\nI could imagine something like a \"nice\" for memory (so that I could nice Chrome and my VM) \n\nThere isn't really a \"nice for memory\".  Memory access is so fast that you can usually practically ignore it.  When you have thrashing, it's not memory, it's disk, that's the problem.  There is an \"ionice\" because of this.  Though that's probably not what I'd recommend for your issue.\nAnother rough equivalent of \"nice for memory\" is swap - you can't control how swappy each process is individually but the system does a pretty good job of working out which processes you are actively using and therefore are a higher priority to be kept in RAM.\nBut as I said and as is a golden rule, if you're running out of RAM, then buying more RAM is the solution with the least headaches and drawbacks.\n", "Q: unable to install php5-mcrypt I want to install php5-mcrypt, I used this command to install mcrypt on my ubuntu 14.04 server:\nsudo apt-get install php5-mcrypt\nand I'm getting the error like this,\nThe following packages have unmet dependencies:\n php5-mcrypt : Depends: phpapi-20100525\n               Depends: php5-common (= 5.4.35-1~dotdeb.1) but 5.5.9+dfsg-1ubuntu4.5 is to be installed\nE: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages.\nplease help me.\n\nA: I found answer to my question.\nI removed php completely in my system using sudo apt-get -y purge php.*\nand install php again on my system.\nreference to remove php:\nHow to completely remove PHP?\n", "Q: how to remove windows if already combined with ubuntu I installed ubuntu next to windows how would I go about getting windows removed without deleting my ubuntu?\n\nA: First things first, back up any important data.

Placed DVD in try and started PC. Got an \"Ubuntu\" screen and waited about 10 minutes for the option to install or run \"live\" from DVD. Chose the live option. Took another 10 minutes to load to the desk top. Desktop was extremely slow to respond, taking a minute or so to load any selection. At one point I received an error box stating that the application I tried to open timed out. Finally clicked shutdown, took several more minutes until I was told to remove DVD and press enter. I did this and waited, and waited and waited. Finally forced power down and restarted back to XP, which is working fine. I tried running live so as to see how fast Ubuntu will run on the old EMachine. I don't want to install Ubuntu if it will be this slow on this PC. What am I doing wrong?\n\nA: The problem you are having is likely due to the amount of RAM you have.\nWhile Ubuntu 14.04 only requires 512MB to run, having 1GB or less will cause Ubuntu to run slowly due to the graphic intensive Unity packages. More info can be found in this answer here.\nIt is probably best if you try a distribution such as:\n\n\n*\n\n*Puppy Linux\nIt is much more lightweight, as shown in the system requirements.\nI expect using a less resource intensive OS like Puppy Linux will fix your problems.\nAlthough if you really want to stay with Ubuntu, it might be worth trying the lxde desktop environment. You can get it by running:\n$ sudo apt-get install lxde\n\nThen just log out, and click the button by your name in the log-in window. Choose 'LXDE' and see if it is better for you.\n\nA: Slow down partner!  ;-)\nUbuntu is ALWAYS slower for the first two weeks.  I don't know why this is, but I've personally experienced it too many times to not believe that it somehow tweaks itself.  I suspect that on a site such as this one there's probably at least one person who knows.  You just need to give it time, and probably a little more RAM.\nI upvoted the answer above because it addresses nearly everything I would have said.  It is my personal experience that computers QUITE as old as yours generally don't work very well with Ubuntu if they have less than 1.5 gigs of RAM.  Usually their max is 2g anyway, and doesn't cost much. If you can't afford a faster computer, then at least upgrade the RAM.\nIn my personal opinion, provided you can increase its RAM, your computer absolutely CAN run Ubuntu, if that's what you want to run.  Ubuntu is certainly more functional and easier to use than a lot of other versions of Linux.\nAs for other versions of Linux, I would not advise Puppy Linux, at least not unless it has changed a great deal since the last time I saw it.  As for LXDE I tried it briefly on my Chromebook and it wasn't terrible, which is to say I'd find a way to use it if I had to choose between it and Windows.\nMy first suggestion would be Light Ubuntu known as LUBUNTU.\nIf you take up LUBUNTU you should be able to continue getting support from this forum as LUBUNTU is essentially UBUNTU, but without features which cause it to run slowly on older computers or those with particularly inefficient graphics cards.\nOr I might suggest something similar to LUBUNTU called MINT.\nIf you want to see just how blazingly fast your somewhat older PC, if you don't mind some kludgey graphics, you can try DSL.  I have more experience with DSL than either LUBUNTU or MINT.  DSL stands for Damn Small Linux.  It can run on computers too slow or having too little RAM to run at all.  It can even run on a 486.  Best of all since DSL is Debian based, (Like Ubuntu) your installation can grow if you choose to move the old hard drive into a newer computer, and much of what you learn from the experience will directly apply to a more modern Linux installation when you eventually upgrade.\n\nA: I think gyropyge hit it on the head. Found an old RAM board and installed it to get up to this old putz up to 1GB Ram. I downloaded Lubuntu 14.10 (32 bit) and ran it live.

Adding custom bookmarks is not a solution since there will be too many of them, and they'll be useless every time.\nHowever, every time, I restart my system and open the pdf files, they open from page 1 and not that last page. This is very inconvenient as a lot of time gets spoiled just to recall where I left, and then find that page.

Because Skype is distributed as an i386 program, and by the rules of multiarch, you need to have the same version of the i386 version of the package installed. However, http://deb.tuxedocomputers.com/ubuntu/ (the place you got the newer package from) only gives the amd64 version of the package.\nOne solution might be to add the xorg-edgers PPA, which seems to be where that version is from. Both amd64 and i386 versions of packages are built in PPAs.\nAlternatively, you can downgrade to the distro version of the package (Mesa 10.1.3) by using ppa-purge.\n", "Q: When I install packages, I keep getting fontconfig warning I'm running Ubuntu 14.04 LTS on a virtual machine, and I was installing packages, specifically text editors in this case (emacs23, sublime, vim..).

I configured SFTP using the guide “Remote Access over SFTP on Ubuntu 14.04”, but I’m confused by the directory structure. Why should I create another folder inside the home directory for upload? “How to set up FTP server on Ubuntu 14.04” gives the same guidance. I need to upload documents directly to the home folder. How can I do this?\n\nA: Both guides are for securing SSH access and limiting users to an SFTP-only chroot. For just SFTP access, all you need to do is:\nsudo apt-get install ssh\n\nNothing more.\n\nA: Now Muru's excellent 100% correct answer in human speak: If you want access for yourself to your own machine, sudo apt-get install ssh is all you need!\nIf you want to allow other people into your machine, better create another (sub) directory and limit those users to that directory!  ;-)\n", "Q: problem with grep I was wondering why I get the following output when searching for files with the command: \n$ grep -l prac *\nallprac\ngrep: Desktop: Is a directory\ngrep: Documents: Is a directory\ngrep: Downloads: Is a directory\ngrep: Music: Is a directory\ngrep: Pictures: Is a directory\n\nI was wondering why it shows everything else besides the obvious allprac? A couple of the listed directories are empty.\n\nA: The * forces grep to scan inside all files in the current folder instead of grepping the standard input, but since grep drive not into subfolders it just reports folder ocurriences to stderrm and to disable reporting just redirect stderr to /dev/null (POSIX):\n$ grep -l prac * 2>/dev/null\n\nthen additional way to avoid reporting of folders is (non-POSIX):\n$ grep -l Build --exclude-dir=* *\n\nto scan including subfolders (POSIX):\n$ grep -l prac * -r\n\nto grep standard input (POSIX):\n$ cat file | grep -l prac\n\nThere are many implementation of grep so it may differ to each other in set of keys and default behaviour, but there is a standard POSIX that describes minimum set of key to be implemented by grep (and other soft). However I know nothing about wheither the POSIX define the default search dehaviour for grep. It seems tha unix implementation do nearly to grep -l Build --exclude-dir=* * of linux.\n\nA: @Cremefraiche's answer is right in that it's due to the wildcard. However, his solution doesn't seem to work. Since the '*' shell wildcard matches all files and folders (except dot files), bash ends up sending the names of all files and folders in the current directory as arguments to grep. Since it's not possible to \"read in\" a directory (similar to how you can't cat a directory), you should exclude the directories. The best way to do this would be to use the find tool.\ngrep -l prac $(find . -maxdepth 1 -type f)\n\nThis would search all regular files (-type f) in the directory. If you want to do a recursive search in the same way, just remove the -maxdepth option. Note, this will not work for files with spaces in their names... still working on a version for that.\n", "Q: How to extract CPGZ File I have a file with cpgz extension and I want to extract it on Ubuntu 14.04.

As many have heard/read the news, a module of the state-sponsored trojan malware named \"Turla\" was recently discovered which infects Linux hosts: (News from ArsTechnica) (News from OMG-Ubuntu) (Technical Report by Kaspersky)\nIn the ArsTechnica article, it is mentioned that:\n\nAdministrators who want to check for Turla-infected Linux systems can check outgoing traffic for connections to news-bbc.podzone[.]org or 80.248.65.183, ...  Admins can also build a signature using a tool called YARA that detects the strings \"TREX_PID=%u\" and \"Remote VS is empty !\"\n\nThis short explanation doesn't really help me to figure out how I should check if my system is infected or not!\nSo can someone give a clear step-by-step explanation?\nUPDATE: Although there seems to be no absolute method for detecting the infection, but a clear and step-by-step explanation using convenient tools for network monitoring to detect connections to the above-mentioned addresses (e.g. vnstat, netstat, ...) and steps using convenient tools for blocking connection to and from the above-mentioned addresses (e.g. ufw, iptables, ...) is greatly appreciated and DESIRED!\n\nA: I just did a write-up on Turla yesterday over at security.stackexchange.com, covering both Windows and Linux versions. You can find it here.\nGood news, by reading it you can get a better idea of what the Turla family is capable of.\nBad news, \"Although Linux variants from the Turla framework were known to exist, we haven't seen any in the wild yet.\" - Kaspersky Lab\nThat means that the only analysis done so far has been from malware captured in a honeypot, and that it is very hard to detect.

When I go to the folder my media is in, it doesn't show but if I move it to videos under the place home it does show. What if anything can I do?\n\nA: You are on the right track; so far so good!\nOpen up a terminal & become root: \nsudo -i\n\nNext, find the UUID for your drive: blkid /dev/sdb1, copy the result (with your mouse!). I am assuming here that you have only these 2 drives, no USB etc - it may not be sdb otherwise. You should get something like UUID=\"fgbdjdilyh354dfh\"\nThen edit /etc/fstab & add (note the lack of quote marks)\nUUID=fgbdjdilyh354dfh /path/where/you/want/this ext4 defaults 0 0\n\nThis will put the drive where you want it, at next boot. It will then hide any files already there; so move them to the new drive - you don't want to be root for this step so exit (I use CTRL-D ), cp -R old/location/* new/drive/, I suggest you remove the originals because they will just clutter your SSD whilst being inaccessible.\nYou can then either reboot; or, perhaps safer, sudo umount /new/drive ; sudo mount -a & check that df -h returns a sensible looking layout and the system works.\n", "Q: Why I can't create a new partition? I installed my OS but did not create a swap space. I now realize it is a problem. I have a 4GB ram and I will running huge applications. The below is the snip of my gparted. I opened Gparted but could not find swap on. I saw the accepted answer to this question. Will it work for me. In laymen terms, If I use those two commands can I forget about swap space and related things. Even more laymen, If I shutdown my system and restart it, will i then have to worry about swap space. \n\n\nA: You can either go with a swap file, like the answer to the question you link to, or you can add a swap partition.\nUsing a swap file:\nCommand borrowed from #Qasim in Does it make sense to create swap partitions for new installations nowadways?\nFirst switch to the root user\nsudo su\n\nThen run the following command\nmkdir /swap && cd /swap && fallocate -l 2g 2GB.swap && mkswap 2GB.swap && swapon 2GB.swap && echo \"# # # Swap File # # #\" >> /etc/fstab && echo \"/swap/2GB.swap    none                   swap               sw                       0       0\" >> /etc/fstab && mount -a \n\nThis will first create a folder called /swap, then enter the folder and add a 2 GB swap file. Then it will activate the swap file, and at last, it adds an entry to /etc/fstab that ensures this happens every time.\nUsing a swap partition:\nSeeing as you are using an MS-DOS partition table, you can not have more primary partitions. In order to make a swap partition, you will have to 'temporarily' delete one of your partitions.\nSo first back up your data from that partition, then in gparted, delete the partion. \nRight click on the now unallocated space and create a new partion, make sure to choose 'Logical' partition. \nThis logical partition can contain a lot of primary partitions, so now you can create a partition similar to the one you deleted, and add the swap partition next to it.\nOnce the swap partition is created, you can activate it with sudo swapon /dev/sda5 (replacing /dev/sda5 with the actual name of the partition).\nTo ensure that it is activated every time you boot, you'll have to edit /etc/fstab\nsudo nano /etc/fstab\n\nAdd a new line with the following text, replacing /dev/sda5 with the name of your device:\n/dev/sda5 none swap sw 0 0\n\nSave with CTRL+O, then close with CTRL+X\n", "Q: Add Prefix name in a file in Perl Script I am trying to write a perl script to add the prefix name on the file (~100 files), but i am failed to get it done.\nExample case that what I means:\nabc.jpg change to NYear_abc.jpg     \ndef.jpg change to NYear_def.jpg    \nghi.jpg change to NYear_ghi.jpg\n\nThis is what I try to search around and write it:\n#!/usr/bin/perl \nfor (filename in \"*\".jpg;)\ndo {rename \"$filename\" \"prefix_$filename\";}\n\nIt shows me missing operator, anyone can help?\n\nA: I don't know about perl syntax and perl scripting but I can help you to rename all .jpg files with its rename command as following:\nFirst you have to switch the directory that you have all .jpg there. for example if files are stored in /home/star1017/jpg-file, I type like this:\ncd /home/star1017/jpg-file\n\nthen run\nrename -n 's/(.*)\\.jpg$/prefix_$1.jpg/' *.jpg\n\nMatch everything (.*) which is ends$ with .jpg then add a prefix_ and print matched group$1(this means print the matched group by using its back-reference) and then print the extension.

As the xorg.edgers group ask not to give installation instructions directly without linking to their page, this is the best I can do.\nIf you don't know what a PPA is or need some more guidance after reading their page, leave a comment below.\n", "Q: Eclipse uninstallation I have installed two different version of eclipse- one from software and another from eclipse' website.

However, since yesterday, both programs suddenly hang without actually launching anything for about a minute. I did install some regular distribution updates, but none of them appeared to be X related at all. After hanging for a while, both programs exit with an error message: \noptirun: [ERROR]Cannot access secondary GPU - error: X unresponsive after 10 seconds - aborting\n\nprimus: fatal: Bumblebee daemon reported: error: X unresponsive after 10 seconds - aborting\n\nHowever, the secondary X server with nvidia driver actually does start up, and when I run, e.g. \nDISPLAY=:8 xterm\n\nthe xterm window shows up on the external monitor connected to the Nvidia card, so it appears to be a communication problem within bumblebee. Running bumblebeed and optirun with --debug doesn't produce any useful information, both programs just hang for about a minute and then exit.\nAny ideas how to fix this?\n\nA: As usual, I've found the solution myself ~ 5 minutes after posting the question: I had edited my firewall settings, and they were too restrictive - in particular, they prevented bumblebeed from connecting to the X server via port 8001. Firewall settings adjusted, everything back to normal :-/\n\n(Edited the follow up comments back into answer -Editor )\nI used netstat -altup and saw that bumblebeed was in SYN_SENT state, which usually means that the initial connection was silently dropped by the firewall. \n", "Q: Browse internet through another host without having external public ip on any host I need to browse several websites (that also have flash content) through my home internet, while im in my work place. So from the website servers they see only access from my home IP.  \nThere is no direct external public IP address on either home and office computers, and I don't have access to the routers for any changes (NAT/portforwarding, etc).\nI also have my own server on the cloud with a public external IP that I can use to make this route. We can setup any software on the home computer, office computer and cloudserver.\nI found a few useful links:\nHow do I set up a local SOCKS proxy that tunnels traffic through SSH?\nhttp://www.thegeekstuff.com/2013/11/reverse-ssh-tunnel \nBut could not come up with a complete configuration for my case. Could you please let me know what options are there for this problem?\n\nA: The external server certainly give options but I'd like to explore direct connections first.\nThey're faster and generally more reliable. They do however require an IP to connect and the routing at the other end to get your connection from router to server. You say you don't have these but I think you might be overlooking options.\n\n\n*\n\n*I find it hard (not impossible) to believe that you have no legal IP. Most home connections have one. The router gets it and uses NAT and DHCP to give you private internal IPs. While at home you can ask Google for your IP address and it should tell you.\nLots of home connections use dynamic IP addressing meaning your IP will change on a timetable determined by your ISP. You can work around that by using one of many dynamic DNS options.\n\n*The routing is harder. Traditionally I would ask you to forward a port by logging into the router. You say you can't do that... So what about UPNP? A lot of routers have this turned on by default and this essentially allows you to do the same thing. You lease a port from the router. Setting this up in Ubuntu is fairly simple:\nsudo apt-get install miniupnpc\nupnpc -a <local_ip> 22 22 TCP\n\nThen external machines can access your SSH server through your public IP.\n\nFailing that, you could create a persistent connection from your home computer to the external server that tunnelled back a port to a SSH server running on your home computer. Then people could connect to you home through your server. I've called this reverse port tunnelling.\n\n\n*\n\n*From home: ssh -L 22:0.0.0.0:2200 serveruser@server to expose your home SSH to the server. You'll probably also need to edit /etc/ssh/sshd_config and turn on GatewayPorts (see this)\n\n*Then from anywhere ssh -D -p2200 homeuser@server\nOf course you may find that the connection from home to server stalls or times out. There are various options for working around that.\n\nWith either option you are exposing a seriously big door into your system. Please practise safe computing and follow my tutorial on making SSH more secure.\n", "Q: Deluge: missing systray icon in XFCE Panel (Xubuntu) I installed the latest Deluge version, i enabled both \"enable tray icon\" and \"minimize in tray when closing\", but i can't see any tray icon and if i close the program i can't see anything at all and if i want to open it again i have to start it again with its executable.\nI have Xubuntu 14.04 LTS x64, xfce4-panel 4.11.0 and i can see any other tray icon (at this moment i see Dropbox, Pidgin and Whatpulse, but if i open Audacious, it shows its tray icon without issues).\nAny suggestion?\nThank you so much in advance.\n\nA: Nevermind, I solved it.\nI disabled \"enable application indicator\" and magically the tray icon showed in systray area.\nThank you anyway!\n", "Q: Can't open files created in Ubuntu from Windos I've created a video with KDENLIVE in Ubuntu.

In Ubuntu works fine.\nIt says it can't find the file when I double click it to open it.\nIt is not the first time it happens.\nDoes anyone know why this is happening?\nThank you.\n\nA: Windows 8 doesn't do a real shutdown, so if you write to the ntfs filesystem while the windows system in fact is only in sleep it can lead to filesystem corruption an errors.

Is it possible to make it visble on terminal also.\nI know the usage of tee, but I wish to do this specifically in this way. \n\nA: tee is designed to split STDIN into a file and back out to STDOUT.\nIn simple terms, just pipe it through, like so:\nnmap www.somesite.com | tee file.txt\n\n\nThe current accepted alternative involves running nmap twice which is a horrible idea.\nYou'd be better off running it once to file and then outputting the file.\nnmap www.somesite.com > file.txt; cat file.txt\n\n\nA: That is exactly what tee is for. Why do you not want to use that? \nAn alternative might be to capture the output, and echo it twice:\noutput=$(nmap localhost)\necho \"$output\"\necho \"$output\" > somefile.txt\n\nHowever, in the special case of nmap, you can take advantage of it's output option -ox :\n\n      OUTPUT:\n         -oN/-oX/-oS/-oG <file>: Output scan in normal, XML, s|<rIpt kIddi3,\n            and Grepable format, respectively, to the given filename.\n\n\nFor example:\nnmap -oN somefile.txt localhost\n\nSeems to do exactly what you want: output to the terminal and also write to file.\n\nA: It is not possible to have command line view and redirect process at the same time \nBut you can use the following command to use both the process in sequence\nnmap www.somesite.com && nmap www.somesite.com > file.txt\n\nFirst it will execute the command in terminal and then it will save the output as a file\nHope this helps!\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 Audio Issues I am relatively new to Ubuntu (using 14.04) and am looking for assistance in solving these audio issues. My computer is an alienware m14r2, and has a SoundBlaster Recon 3di sound card.

In fact, if the normalized value is something < 2 is usually indicating the end of the lifetime of an SSD (for this attribute high value means better). Most manufacturers are using this field to indicate the cells are used past the design cycles.\nBased on the Wikipedia article on SMART I think this attribute has an ambiguous meaning.\n\n231 | 0xE7 | Temperature   | Drive Temperature\n231 | 0xE7 | SSD Life Left | Indicates the approximate SSD life left, in terms of\n                             program/erase cycles or Flash blocks currently\n                             available for use.\n\n\nI think it may be a bug of Ubuntu to show this attribute as a temperature field for an SSD. Please try 14.04/14.10 from a live image and see if it still shows it as such. If so, please report it as a bug.\nHere's what manufacturers are using in their documentation:\nSeagate\n\nLimited Warranty with Media Usage provides coverage for the warranty period or until the estimated life indicator reaches 1 as reported by SMART attribute 231.\n\nKingston\n\n231 SSD Life Left\n[...]\nNormalized Value Range:\n100 = Best = Full SSD life remains  \n  1 = Worst = Insufficient Flash blocks remain in service for proper\n  SSD operation\n\n", "Q: How do I uninstall Ubuntu 14.04.1 from a Vista machine?

Let's say I'm a bit paranoid with access settings.\nCreate a dedicated user for your particular database, with only necessary permissions granted for the access. To do that you will need to use \"grant\" command (this manual may help: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/grant.html)\nSo you need something like that, for example (with probably waaay to broad privileges - I would change that \"all\" to whatever you need, ie.: \"select,insert,update\" - find more in the manual)\ngrant all privileges on your_db.* to your_user@your_windows_host identified by \"the_password\";\nTechnically you should actuall use \"create user\" command first - but \"grant\" will get this sorted for you as a part of its own task.\nI hope that helps.\n", "Q: Where has my title bar in Deluge gone?

If there is a closed-source driver available for your hardware you will get a choice to install the driver it during the Ubuntu installation. \nIn rare cases, you will have to manually install a closed-source driver.\nWhat will work\nThe CPU, RAM, hard drive, and Graphics.\nNote, your laptop has two graphics cards, Intel's built-in and NVIDIA 280M. If this is a NVDIA Optimus system Windows can switch between these two as an when needed without any input from you. Ubuntu (and Linux, in general) does not have this capability yet. You will have to select one, and turn the other off. There are two drivers available for the NVDIA graphics card. You may choose the proprietary one instead of the default opensource one at the time of installation or at any time later.\nWhat may or may not work \nThese things will most probably work, but we don't know for sure with the information provided. Laptop makers use chips by different component manufacturers for these components and may switch from one to another for the same model made in different date. Without knowing the manufacturer, make and model numbers of each components, we can't be sure the following components will work:\n\n\n*\n\n*Wireless and bluetooth\n\n*Wired network\n\n*webcam\n\n\nWhat can you do?\nAs others have said, you can create a Live USB/DVD for Ubuntu and boot from it without making any changes to your computer. This will run a full version of Ubuntu directly from the Live USB/DVD.

The dialog is indicating the partitioning method, not the location of the boot sector for your installation.  There is an unfortunate ambiguity between these two meanings of master boot record (MBR).\nHowever, if this was in fact where your boot sector resides then deleting this partition may have killed your boot -- and re-installation might be your best bet.  Installing to a multiple disk system is a bit of an advanced operation and may require some deeper understanding to fully manage the process.  One way of simplifying this would be to physically remove the extra disk while you perform the installation.\nAs an aside: Your safest bet, given the starting point of this question, might have been to simply ignore the 255 MB partition and just add a new partition (using the \"Disks\" utility that you showed) in the remaining space on that device.  Wasting 255 MB of a 1TB disks is not a significant loss.\nTo mount the drive manually, you should be able to do that using the file manager (what you called \"explorer\") -- just click on the item in the \"Devices\" list.

I want to connect 2 hdds to my qemu virtual machine. One of them is actually a file connected via virtio, and I want it to be the bootable drive. The other is a partition that I want to pass through; I add it through IDE (though I'm not sure if it's the best way to do it). The problem is, as soon as I add the IDE drive, it takes priority in Seabios, and the virtual machine will try to boot from it, ignoring the bootable virtio drive. This can be worked around by using boot menu, but it's tedious. I want to be able to somehow make the virtio drive the default bootable drive, maybe by changing the order in which drives are listed in Seabios, is it possible? The relevant part of the command I start qemu-system-x86_64 with is:\n-device virtio-scsi-pci,id=scsi \\\n-drive file=/media/kv/vms/win-qad.img,id=disk,format=raw -device scsi-hd,drive=disk \\\n-drive file=/dev/sdg1,id=shared_disk,format=raw -device ide-hd,bus=ide.1,drive=shared_disk \\\n\n\nA: Yes, \"sata\" device is probed first, but you can change the boot device either \"hand-off\" with:\n-boot order=c\n\nor by manual selection with:\n-boot menu=on\n\nBoth option can be used thogether:\n-boot order=c,menu=on\n\n", "Q: No unity on log in after update I recently did what ended up being a do-release-upgrade to Ubuntu 14.10 from Ubuntu 14.10.

My fans are all running full-tilt, and the system is completely unresponsive- I can't ctrl-alt-f1 into a command prompt.\nI'm sure this is related to the upgrade, because I can still boot into 3.13.0-40 just fine. I've tried reinstalling linux-generic and linux-image-generic, it didn't change anything.\nWhen I look in syslog, there appear to be no entries at all from the failed boot.\nHow can I troubleshoot what it is about this kernel version that's causing my system to hang?\nSystem specs: Ubuntu 14.04, AMD Radeon HD 7750 graphics card, using the open-source drivers\n\nA: Introduction\nI also had the same problem after an update on a AMD A6-6400 processor with a Radeon HD GPU. Got the black screen of death (BSOD). I was able to boot up (sometimes) holding down the shift key to display the GRUB menu, selecting \"Advanced options for Ubuntu\" and then selecting a previous version of the kernel (3.13.0-40-generic).\nUpdate V - System rebuild\nMy AMD processor is mounted on a Gigabyte GA-F2A88XN-blah-blah-blah motherboard with retrofit quiet cooling components. I hate noise. I like this system when it works properly because I can't hear it. Don't suggest I change the hardware. That is not going to happen.\nThe Old System\nI had Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (32 bit) installed with the proprietary fglrx drivers enabled. The open source drivers used too much CPU power. I could hear the fans. The open source drivers sucked.\nThis fglrx configuration worked fine for about a year. Then the 14.04 automatic updates stopped working. More BSOD bullshit. That kind of thing. Enough is enough.\nThe New System\nThe new system started with Ubuntu 15.10 (64 bit) installed with the open-source drivers enabled. Everything seemed to work. I then enabled the fglrx drivers. Everything seemed to work. WooHoo. Time for lunch.\nFor some reason, after some time had passed, the custom cooling fans began to run at maximum speed. My black box was noisy and annoying.\nThe sun was shining on the box and it was a warm day, but the CPU should have been napping. Now it sounded like it was competing in the Tour-de-France. \nI powered up the TV, turned on the remote keyboard. Make sure the proper HDMI input is selected. This takes probably 45 seconds. The box, meanwhile, is screaming for air. The Black Screen Of Death (BSOD) is the only response. This procedure takes more than 45 seconds.\nSo I press & hold the front-panel power button. I count to 10. Slowly. Nothing happens. WTF?!? I wait a bit more because I don't know what to do. Never had this happen before. \nSo then I pull the power cord.\nRecovery from this condition is a bit complicated, but it can be done. I would tell you how I did this but I forget now and Your Mileage May Vary (YMMV) anyway. Just ask Volkswagon.\nShort version: AMD A6-6400 on a Gigabyte GA-F2A... motherboard? Install Ubuntu 15.10 64 bit. Use the open source drivers. That works best.\nUpdate IV\nI have since altered a line in /etc/default/grub from\nGRUB_DEFAULT=0\n\nto\nGRUB_DEFAULT=\"Advanced options for Ubuntu>Ubuntu, with Linux 3.13.0-40-generic\"\n\nNote the text in the quotation marks is the exact same text as it appears on the 2 levels of GRUB menus.

I hope a future update will make this problem go away. This last update was a total nightmare!\nUpdate III\nThe latest kernel update (3.13.0.45) crippled my system. I am now using the latest AMD proprietary drivers and everything works again. This was another painful update. So now I'm thinking of using something other than Ubuntu. Seriously.\nUpdate II\nAs reported below, the latest Linux kernel update (3.13.0-44) corrected the problem for me because I apparently use the Radeon driver. The problem was reported Dec 14 but it took almost a full month to correct the problem.\nBut wait! There's more!

Let me know if you have the answer!!!\n\nA: This is the official documentation.\nIt sounds like right now you have one big iso file sitting on the USB drive. That's not going to work to boot and start the installer. To set that up using your MacBook, you'll want to download unetbootin\nThat will let you extract the files from the iso onto the USB device in a bootable format.\nAt that point, you should be able to plug the USB drive into the computer you plan on installing Linux on, tell it to boot from the device (either by going into the BIOS and changing the boot order or selecting the boot menu by hitting F12).\nThis should boot into an installer which will walk you through the process.

First, I have Ubuntu installed on an old Windows laptop and as you may know the SUPER key showed in keyboard shortcuts is Windows key on my laptop. Now you may have a problem that Ubuntu will see your left CTRL as a key combo or a special key,so try to connect a different keyboard to see of it still does that. If yes, the key mapping has been understood wrong by Ubuntu  and you will have to search and download a keyboard mapping program, but the preliminary test for this is to put up the (or a) on-screen keyboard and see if clicking the LCTRL will still open your CD-ROM. In the ABSOLUTE worst case re-install Ubuntu.\nNow I just found out: go to system settings, under Text Entry and in the bottom right corner you should see keyboard settings. Check that out. If nothing indicates the use of LCTRL then do sudo apt-get install gnome-tweak-tool in terminal and from there you HAVE to find it.

So I searched in internet and the only fix I understand was with the boot repair application.\n\nI suppose this actually meant Ubuntu did not boot?\n\nAfter installing ubuntu, using something else option and installing it on a different disk than windows 8 ,\n\nThat is not a very accurate description of what you did. First your Windows 8 is not on a GPT partitioned drive, which indicates that it couldn't be a typical UEFI installation.\nYour Linux swap partition is on the Windows drive, that's not bad, but not very consistent either. The worse thing is that your root filesystem is on an extended partition on the second drive (sdb5). The recommended way is to put at least the root filesystem on a primary partition to have GRUB working properly. With less than 3 primary partitions on sdb, I don't even see a reason to setup an extended partition.\nIt looks like boot-repair did the best it could by installing GRUB to sda1 (And re-formatting it with EXT4!? Windows doesn't do that. Probably because only EXT3/4 support embedding of GRUB.), where it should have told you to reinstall with a proper partition layout. So I'll do that:\n\n\n*\n\n*Please backup all data on sdb and create a primary partition to install Ubuntu there in.\n\n*Choose sdb as target for MBR bootloader installation for GRUB.\n\n*You probably need to repair your Windows bootloader (like oldfred pointed out in his comment) with bcdboot and reformat sda1.\n\n", "Q: How can i execute a jar file? to execute a jar file, at the first i installed  openjdk pakeges and then  next command:\njava -jar ccnChat.jar\nI got this error:\nFailed to load Main-Class manifest attribute from ccnChat.jar\nthen i tried another way:\ni right clicked on the jar file, and i marked allow executing file as program from  permissions tab and i chose openjdk as  its default program. then i double clicked on jar file but it didn't open.

If it doesn so, remove every \"windowsy\" thing from the EFI partition. The EFI partition is mounted at /boot/efi. Look for a directory like /boot/efi/EFI/Windows.\nLegacy BIOS: Note that most Windows installations keep their boot loader in a separate 100 MB partition. Delete this partition too, if it's still there.\nAfterwards run sudo update-grub to remove the Windows boot loader from GRUB.\n", "Q: How do I get rid of this allocated space? Okay, so I like how my drives are looking:\n\nWell, almost. But I have two unallocated sections that I want to get rid of.\nHow do I do this?

Everything's as large as it can go! How can I expand into this unallocated space?\n\nA: There are a number of issues which are probably going to make this difficult for you:\n\n\n*\n\n*Traditionally, partitioning software liked to align partitions to logical tracks, so if you have 63 sectors per track, this meant aligning partitions to multiples of 63 sectors.  In practice this is a small amount of data much smaller than a megabyte.\nHowever, hard drives have been using logical (ie, fake) addressing where the tracks and sectors are meaningless, for a long time.  In reality hard drives now use a variable number of sectors per track from the outside to the inside of each disc.\nNowadays, with flash and SSD drives being popular, partitioning software tends to prefer aligning partitions to multiples of 1MB.\n\n*The first partition cannot be at the very start of the drive because that space is reserved, so the first partition can only be either 63 sectors in (if aligning the old way) or 1MB in (if aligning the new way).\n\n*If you first partition was created with older partitioning software, it probably starts at the 63rd sector.  If your subsequent partitions were created with newer partitioning software, it probably starts on a multiple of 1MB.  Because these don't align, there will be a space between them of <1MB.\n\n*There is absolutely nothing wrong with this, particularly on a traditional hard drive (eg non-SSD) or as in your case, a virtual one.  You can align however you like with no performance penalty.  In addition, a space penalty of less than 1MB on a 50GB drive is so miniscule as to be ignorable.  Don't put yourself through the trouble just to save less than 1MB.  Your only issue is that it looks kinda ugly in Gparted.\n\n*Your other partition (sda5) is within an extended partition.  Gparted is currently unable to move the boundaries of an extended partition.  In addition, due to the space required at the start of an extended partition I have a feeling it's impossible to align it to a 1MB boundary and not have a very small amount of wasted space around it.\n\n*The other partition is a swap partition.  Gparted may not be able to resize swap partitions, but that's no problem, since it's expendable data anyway so you can just trash it and create a new swap partition a different size.\nThat said, I can solve your problems.  sda5 is only swap, so instead of resizing it, trash it, then trash that extended partition around it.  That will consolidate all the free space into one blob.\nThen, create a new swap partition occupying all that unused space.\nYou may still have <1MB gaps between partitions for the reasons highlighted elsewhere, but Gparted usually don't even show these if they are just around normal partitions.\n", "Q: installing mini ccnx I want to install mini ccnx from the following site:\nhttps://github.com/chesteve/mn-ccnx/wiki/Installing\nI downloaded and installed all the requirement programs and then ran:\nsudo apt-get install git\ngit clone git://github.com/carlosmscabral/mn-ccnx\n\nThey worked properly but after the next command:\nsudo ./mn-ccnx/util/install.sh -fnv\n\nI got:\nsudo: ./mn-ccnx/util/install.sh: command not found\n\nBut the install.sh file exists in the path /mn-ccnx/util.\nCould you please help me, what is the problem and how can it be solved?\n\nA: I checked that repository and noted that the install file is not executable.

How can I display the IP address shown on eth0 using a script ?\n\nA: You should use ip (instead of ifconfig) as it's current, maintained, and perhaps most importantly for scripting purposes, it produces a consistent & parsable output. Following are a few similar approaches:\nIf you want the IPv4 address for your Ethernet interface eth0:\n$ ip -4 -o addr show eth0 | awk '{print $4}'\n192.168.1.166/24  \n\nAs a script:\n#!/usr/bin/env bash  \nINTFC=eth0  \nMYIPV4=$(ip -4 -o addr show $INTFC | awk '{print $4}') \necho $MYIPV4\n\nwill yield: 192.168.1.166/24 as its output\nThe output produced above is in CIDR notation. If CIDR notation isn't wanted, it can be stripped:\n$ ip -4 -o addr show eth0 | awk '{print $4}' | cut -d \"/\" -f 1 \n192.168.1.166  \n\nAnother option that IMHO is \"most elegant\" gets the IPv4 address for whatever interface is used to connect to the specified remote host (8.8.8.8 in this case). Courtesy of @gatoatigrado in this answer:\n$ ip route get 8.8.8.8 | awk '{ print $NF; exit }'\n192.168.1.166\n\nOr, as a script:\n#!/usr/bin/env bash  \nRHOST=8.8.8.8  \nMYIP=$(ip route get $RHOST | awk '{ print $NF; exit }')\necho $MYIP\n\nwill yield: 192.168.1.166 as its output\nThis works perfectly well on a host with a single interface, but more advantageously will also work on hosts with multiple interfaces and/or route specifications.\nWhile ip would be my preferred approach, it's certainly not the only way to skin this cat. Here's another approach that uses hostname if you prefer something easier/more concise:\n$ hostname --all-ip-addresses | awk '{print $1}'  \n\nOr, if you want the IPv6 address:\n$ hostname --all-ip-addresses | awk '{print $2}'  \n\nAs a script:\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\nMYV4IP=$(hostname --all-ip-addresses | awk '{print $1}') \nMYV6IP=$(hostname --all-ip-addresses | awk '{print $2}')\necho $MYV4IP\necho $MYV6IP \n\nwill yield: 192.168.1.166, and 2601:7c1:103:b27:352e:e151:c7d8:3379 as its answers (assuming you have an IPv6 address assigned).\n\nA: @markus-lindberg 's response is my favourite. If you add -o -4 to ip's flags then you get a much more easily parsable (and consistent) output:\nip -o -4 a | awk '$2 == \"eth0\" { gsub(/\\/.*/, \"\", $4); print $4 }'\n\n-o stands for --oneline, which is meant to help in exactly this kind of situations. The -4 is added to limit to the IPv4 address, which is what all the other responses imply.\n\nA: For the sake of providing another option, you could use the ip addr command this way to get the IP address:\nip addr show eth0 | grep \"inet\\b\" | awk '{print $2}' | cut -d/ -f1\n\n\n\n*\n\n*ip addr show eth0 shows information about eth0\n\n*grep \"inet\\b\" only shows the line that has the IPv4 address (if you wanted the IPv6 address, change it to \"inet6\\b\")\n\n*awk '{print $2}' prints on the second field, which has the ipaddress/mask, example 172.20.20.15/25\n\n*cut -d/ -f1 only takes the IP address portion.\n\n\nIn a script:\n#!/bin/bash\ntheIPaddress=$(ip addr show eth0 | grep \"inet\\b\" | awk '{print $2}' | cut -d/ -f1)\n\n\nA: Note: This answer is for older systems. If this does not work for you please consider other answers. This answer is not incorrect.\nsave this in a file and then run bash <filename>\n#!/bin/bash\nifconfig eth0 | grep \"inet addr\"\n\nbeing more accurate to get only number showing IP address:\n#!/bin/bash\nifconfig eth0 | grep \"inet addr\" | cut -d ':' -f 2 | cut -d ' ' -f 1\n\nUpdate: If this doesn't works for you, try the other answer\nUpdate: For Ubuntu 18+, try: (don't forget to replace eth0 with interface you need the IP for. Thanks to @ignacio )\nifconfig eth0 | grep \"inet \" | awk '{print $2}'\n\n\nA: Here are some oneliners.....\nAwk\nifconfig eth0 | awk '/inet addr/{split($2,a,\":\"); print a[2]}'\n\nsplit function in the above awk command splits the second column based on the delimiter : and stores the splitted value into an associative array a. So a[2] holds the value of the second part.\nsed\nifconfig eth0 | sed -n '/inet addr/s/.*inet addr: *\\([^[:space:]]\\+\\).*/\\1/p'\n\nIn basic sed , \\(...\\) called capturing group which is used to capture the characters. We could refer those captured characters through back-referencing. \\([^[:space:]]\\+\\) captures any character but not space one or more times.\ngrep\nifconfig eth0 | grep -oP 'inet addr:\\K\\S+'\n\n\\K discards the previously matched characters from printing at the final and \\S+ matches one or more non-space characters.\nPerl\nifconfig eth0 | perl -lane 'print $1 if /inet addr:(\\S+)/'\n\nOne or more non-space characters which are next to the inet addr: string are captured and finally we print those captured characters only.\n\nA: Taken from https://stackoverflow.com/a/14910952/1695680\nhostname -i\n\nHowever that may return a local ip address (127.0.0.1), so you may have to use, and filter:\nhostname -I\n\nFrom hostname's manpages:\n\n-i, --ip-address\nDisplay the network address(es) of the host name. Note that this works only if the  host  name  can  be  resolved. Avoid using this option; use hostname --all-ip-addresses instead.\n-I, --all-ip-addresses\nDisplay  all  network addresses of the host. This option enumerates all configured addresses on all network inter‐faces. The loopback interface and IPv6 link-local addresses are omitted. Contrary to option -i, this  option  does not depend on name resolution. Do not make any assumptions about the order of the output.\n\n\nA: ip addr|awk '/eth0/ && /inet/ {gsub(/\\/[0-9][0-9]/,\"\"); print $2}'\n\nThis only use ip addr which is a replacement for ifconfig and awk combined with substitution (gsub).\nStop using too many processes for simple tasks\n\nA: Just one more option that can be useful if you don't have awk (as it is the case in some embedded devices):\nip addr show dev eth0 scope global | grep \"inet\\b\" | cut -d/ -f 1 | egrep -o \"([[:digit:]]{1,3}[.]{1}){3}[[:digit:]]{1,3}\"\n\n\nA: Here's a good one, only uses grep as secondary command:\nip addr show eth0 | grep -oP 'inet \\K\\S[0-9.]+'\nI don't see why you should use more commands than needed\n\nA: ifconfig eth0|grep 'inet '|awk '{print $2}'\n\nA: here's for IPv4:\nip -f inet a|grep -oP \"(?<=inet ).+(?=\\/)\"\nhere's for IPv4 & particular dev (eth0):\nip -f inet a show eth0|grep -oP \"(?<=inet ).+(?=\\/)\"\nfor IPv6:\nip -6 -o a|grep -oP \"(?<=inet6 ).+(?=\\/)\"\n\nA: I suggest using a python library like netifaces that is specifically designed for this purpose.\nsudo pip install netifaces\npython -c \"import netifaces; print netifaces.ifaddresses('eth0')[netifaces.AF_INET][0]['addr']\"\n\nTo obtain the default network interface that is in use.\ndefault_inf = netifaces.gateways()['default'][netifaces.AF_INET][1]\n\n\nA: this can be used with a normal user too.\nip addr show eth0 | grep \"inet \" | cut -d '/' -f1 | cut -d ' ' -f6\n\n\nA: in these days with multiples interfaces (eg if you use a docker) and naming interface by ETH is not anymore the norms\nI use this command to extract the IP/Mask : \nIPMASK=$(ip a s|grep -A8 -m1 MULTICAST|grep -m1 inet|cut -d' ' -f6)\n\nSo whatever how many interfaces I'll have and whatever their name, GREP will only grab the first having the MULTICAST option.\nI use this command to extract only the IP without the mask : \nIP=$(ip a s|grep -A8 -m1 MULTICAST|grep -m1 inet|cut -d' ' -f6|cut -d'/' -f1)\n\nI use these command on different BDS & NIX it never fail ;)\n\nA: Yet another way (assuming you don't want a CIDR address and want IPv4):\n$ ip -br -4 addr show dev eth0 | awk '{split($3,a,\"/\"); print a[1]}'\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Uses the ip command which is not deprecated\n\n*Uses only one command for filtering\n\n\nA: This is the shortest way I could find:\nip -f inet addr show $1 | grep -Po 'inet \\K[\\d.]+'\nReplace $1 with your network interface.\nip -f inet tells ip to only return values for the inet (ipv4) family.\ngrep -Po tells grep to interperate the next value as a perl-regex, and only print the matching values.\nThe regex \\K[\\d.]+ says \"throw away everything up to this point (\\K), and match as many numeric values followed by a dot in a row as possible\".

This happens across all programs. And it doesn't seem like the ESC key has been remapped (if this is the proper term) to be =, but that my computer is recognizing a press of ESC as a press of =. For instance, when I have the \"Keyboard Layout Chart\" up on my screen and I press ESC, = lights up orange. All other keys are working correctly. \nAny thoughts on what happened or how to fix it?

I have a Ubuntu server that I do web development on at work. At work I use a Windows PC but I am on the internal network so I can Putty into the server to change code. I access the pages it serves from Windows.\nFrom home on my Windows 8.1 PC I can use Putty to SSH into the Gateway Server and from the commnad terminal SSH again to get to my dev server. However I cannot open webpages I am working on from my Windows PC. \nMy boss helped me set up an SSH tunnel to remote into my work computer. But I don't have remote user account access and will need to go to work to fix that. In the mean time I would like to learn more about ssh tunneling and wondering if/how to direct my windows machine to use the SSH tunnel to resolve the IP address so I can view the webpages from my test server on it.\nAlso my ssh tunnel uses a destination IP of another server which I guess is the windows server \nThe port forwards and connects to the Windows Remote server correctly but I cannot connect to it from my ssh terminal I open which is the one that specifies the tunnel in the first place! How does that even work?\n\nA: I found out that I could set up another SSH tunnel to my dev server and access the web pages through my local machine that way. \nThe reason I couldn't SSH into the Windows Remote Server was because it doesn't have an SSH server available only remote desktop.\n", "Q: Not enough free disk space when trying to update 14.04 /boot only has 243 MB of space with 180MB used (according to GParted)\nI'm trying to install updates, but i need another 24.9MB freed.\nI want to resize /boot to give it an extra GB (or so) so i can continue downloading updates.\nGParted won't seem to let me do that.\n\nA: Follow these instructions to clear space:\nNot enough free disk space when upgrading\nI find the ubuntu-tweak method works well.\n", "Q: Irrelevant tool tip text displayed in launcher for chrome When i open any page on chrome and wrong tool tip text is displayed for it (tool tip text of a page i opened some time before) in the launcher. How do i get rid of this.\nI use ubuntu 14.04 32bit.\n\n\nA: The question is not the same. nor the symptoms, but it is related to this one and this one. \nWhat is the issue\nIt looks like your global .desktop file in /usr/share/applications, representing the locked icon in the launcher (the topmost one in your image), has a differently named copy in ~/.local/share/applications . Maybe (likely) as a result of using webapps in the past. When you run the application from the locked launcher icon, the local version of the (differently named) .desktop file shows up as a second icon in the launcher. \nLooking at your image, that seems to be the case.\nNote: if you open the local version of the .desktop file (drag it over a gedit window), you will probably find your strange tooltip in the line starting with Name=.\nWhat you need to do\nLook into ~/.local/share/applications (hidden by default, press Ctrl+H to make it visible) and find .desktop files that might be calling chrome. If you doubt a file, make the file executable. Its icon will show up on the file then, so you will be able to recognize it by its icon. Remove any .desktop file, calling Google Chrome, from the directory ~/.local/share/applications.\nWhen an application is started from an icon, locked to the launcher, and a second icon appears showing a correct icon, it is practically always caused by a duplicate .desktop file with a different name, but calling the same application.\n", "Q: Installing Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS with hardware RAID I have been having some issues with trying to install Ubuntu off of a live usb. The system has a Intel hardware RAID controller and I wish to run my two HDDs in RAID 1. I have come across and issue when running the installer. There seems to be a ??? ??? prompt with the repitition of ??? ??? which appears after the language/region is set.\nFrom what I have read there seems to be some issue with RAID and Ubuntu 14? The only solution I seem to have found is to install mdadm and create a software RAID configuration. But i am guessing a hardware raid would be better as I have the card?\nCan't remember the exact model of the intel RAID card, will update once I have gotten back to the office.\nAny one have any solutions? will check against the compatibility pages once I can get back to the computer to check the RAID card model.\nThanks in advance!\n\nA: I had an issue like this on an HP server with an internal raid controller. It was listed as supported on all the HP and Ubuntu hardware matrices, but it turns out that the controller was only supported on Windows, not Linux.\nHowever, if you have a hardware RAID controller, do you see a prompt when the system POSTs (power on self test), saying something like \"Intel storage array configuration. Press F4\", or some such message? You would press that function key to get into the array configuration software resident on the controller, BEFORE the Ubuntu installation even starts. \nIn that config utility, you would setup your two disks as a RAID1 \"logical volume\". Then, when you go to install Ubuntu, this logical volume would be listed as the disk device upon which you would install Linux.\nThe caveat is that if Ubuntu does NOT support that RAID controller, the logical volume will not be recognized. That's what happened on my HP server.\nSo I had to delete the logical volume (in the raid controller software), then create a software RAID set in the server version of Ubuntu (this isn't available in the desktop version). There is a really good tutorial on the Ubuntu doc set for setting up software raid (using mdadm).\n\nA: The easiest way I've found to avoid it is install lubuntu (the desktop  choice isn’t an issue for me, its running as a webserver).  Seems like it is the RAID and the graphics driver or some weirdness, because if I do get it installed in lubuntu  and I run additional drivers and install a compatible graphics driver it locks up bad again.  (I had used to use classic gnome install on previous installs on this machine but that is gone now)  This was a HP minitower with built-in RAID.\nSo if you are at your wits end, try an lubuntu install and see if it works for you too.  Tried xubuntu too and that didn't work, lubuntu is the one to try.\n", "Q: Ubuntu OS on SSD and RAID-5 for data files I want my NAS to run a lot like Freenas or Nas4free in that I have a separate drive for my OS and all other files (like WWW, media, plex media server and minecraft) run off the raid-5 (3*3tb WD reds). \nDo I mount the root boot and swap on ssd and only home on raid5, or is there a better way of doing this. Maybe installing the whole OS on ssd then point over to the raid array?\n\nA: So you have four disks, one SSD that stands alone, and three 3TB drives in a RAID5 set. It sounds like you won't be doing much on your home directory, with your web, media, plex, etc. on the RAID array. So I would install the OS (root) and swap on the SSD and then mount the RAID device on a directory and carve it up into your requisite subdirectories. That way, you have the speed of the ssd for the OS, but you have the protection of RAID for the web, media, etc. files.\n\nA: Very short answer: Yes! \n\"/\" and swap on SSD, \"/home\" (and any other files) on RAID-5\n", "Q: screen command “No space left on device” I got \"Cannot make directory '/var/run/screen/S-test': No space left on device\" error when creating screen session.\nAs the message saying, there is no space left. My question is: is there a parameter that can tell screen command to make directory on a specified directory, since there are spaces on other file systems.\nAlso, I do not have root permission.\nThanks,\n\nA: You could create a symbolic link for /var/run/screen, and have it point to another directory on a bigger disk partition.\nFor example, say you have a lot of room on /home/foo (use the 'df' command to find out how much space is available on a filesystem).\nYou could:\nrm -rf /var/run/screen;\nmkdir /home/foo/screen;\nln -s /home/foo/screen /var/run/screen\nthen, when screen(1) is run, it will put its files in /home/foo/screen\nsee the ln(1) man page for more information\n", "Q: boot errors after install failure 14.04 Trying to install single boot 14.04 on an Acer Aspire S7 from live USB; the install crashed and now I'm not able to boot. \nI've disabled UEFI (to \"legacy\"), but still not able to install from the live USB. I get the ??? error window one or a few steps in, and then back to the first dialog.\nI ran boot-repair and received the following:\nhttp://paste.ubuntu.com/9483049/\nBut still not able to boot. I'd be happy with no UEFI, no RAID, no Windows, but not sure where to start \n\nA: First, make sure you have the right release of Ubuntu. I don't know if the Acer is a 32 or 64 bit computer, but most of the newer Intel processors are 64 bit now, so make sure you downloaded the Ubuntu \"amd64\" version of 14.04. On the Ubuntu site, you can search for the hardware support matrix to see what version of Ubuntu is supported by that Acer model.\nSecondly, how did you make the live USB? You might want to download \"unetbootin\", a good tool that will create a complete bootable USB drive. I found that fully erasing the drive first helps.\nThird, when you power on the computer, go into the BIOS and make sure the boot order has the USB drive listed before the disk drive. If the disk drive is first, and you have a corrupted installation, the system will not boot up normally.\n", "Q: cli window on ubuntu under oracle vm My Ubuntu boots up to GUI interface.\nHow do I get to the cli or at least a text window?

Those are created by \"persistent bug reports\" that for one or another reason are not deleted after submitting them. After clicking through reports, you may manually clean /var/crash/ folder - it will only contain information you've already submitted.

Current version installed on USB stick is \"ubuntu-14.04.1-desktop-amd64.iso\". \nSystem as it is now:\nMemory 3.4 Gib\nProcessor AMD A4-1250 APU With Radeon (TM) HD Graphics X2 \nGraphics Gallium 0.4 an AMD KABINI\nOS 32-bit “I want X64”\nDisk 488.5 GB\nI am just interested in getting it upgraded to x64 and any help is most appreciated. \n\nA: Does your netbook support 64-bit? It may not, googling it's exact model number (especially the exact cpu) should give specifications for them. If it doesn't support 64-bit then I'd expect it would give some sort of error, but quietly failing & rebooting is a possibility. Update: It appears that the AMD A4-1250 APU supports 64-bit, good news so far.\nAnd is it set to boot from the usb, or was the usb created successfully (can other computers boot from it)? https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BootFromCD has lots of help, may need to change (at least temporarily) the boot order, or verify the usb.\nIt could be that booting from the usb is having problems, it's not as well supported as booting from cd. A cd or cd-rw may work better? Here's a link to my other answer about making a multi-boot USB from linux https://askubuntu.com/a/554834/129271 (references http://www.pendrivelinux.com/boot-multiple-iso-from-usb-via-grub2-using-linux/ basically the same info but hopefully a little clearer)\nAnd this other question shows how to try adding a 64-bit kernel to 32-bit Ubuntu, not the same as a regular out-of-the-box 64-bit install, but maybe interesting: Install 64-bit kernel in 32-bit Ubuntu Little more related info here(different Q, same name?): installing 64 bit kernel on 32bit ubuntu It appears that just installing everything from a 64-bit iso(cd/usb/dvd) is probably a better idea, but if you'll be overwriting your Ubuntu anyway it couldn't hurt (much) to try installing 64-bit in place.\n", "Q: Nothing will boot after December 10 update (14.10, dual boot) I'm running Ubuntu 14.10, dual booted with Windows 8.1. I have an Acer Aspire V5-5520. After today's update (it might be the December 11th update since I did both today), I was prompted to restart the computer. When it came back on, and every time I've tried to boot it since, all I see is the Acer screen, which soon goes black like it wants to bring up the prompt asking whether I want to go into Ubuntu or Windows. But that doesn't come up, and instead I get the Acer screen again. Also, another big problem: holding Shift at startup does nothing, and pressing any F# button does nothing. So it looks like a Gameboy with no cartridge. \nI'm not very tech-savvy, so I'm sorry if any of that was confusing. I haven't tried booting with a live-USB, but I can't access the BIOS/UEFI anyway. Does anybody know what's wrong, how I can fix it, and whether or not my files are safe?\n\nA: To access the BIOS/UEFI shell, try the Del key. Just try it once...\nNow for your crashed system...\nYour system has lost the entry of GRUB from MBR.

I've been pulling my hair out trying to get a full Ubuntu installation running on my USB, and I think I just got it working for Windows (by disconnecting my hard drives during Live CD installation...).\nHowever, the result isn't bootable on my Macbook Air. After more reading, it seems that it's a U/EFI problem which Ubuntu solved by creating an amd64+mac version of the installation.\nI'm downloading that now, but I'm wondering: will this ONLY work for my Macbook, and stop working on the Windows computer?\nThanks.\n\nA: The amd64+mac version should work on both the Mac and the PC.\nThe difference between the amd64 and the amd64+mac is that the amd64 version is 'multi-catalog', ie it can boot on either BIOS or UEFI systems whereas the amd64+mac version only support BIOS booting.\nThe problem is that Macs are not able to boot 'multi-catalog' disks.

Microsoft has not made DirectX available natively for Linux so Wine has to translate all those Direct3D calls into OpenGL... And that takes time.\nOne thing that might be an idea is switching to a CSMT-patched build of Wine. These essentially have multi-threading for the translation process, and that speeds things up quite a bit in some (not all) games. Until they're pulled into the main version of Wine, the patches can run behind the standard builds but it's largely worth it.\n", "Q: Problems with Eclipse GUI Sometimes, without any evident pattern, Eclipse fails to render some stuff.

Are you connecting the displays to the onboard Intel video controller or the NVIDIA controller? \nIf you are using the NVIDIA controller, I'd recommend going to the NVIDIA site, looking up the NVS5200M video controller, downloading the driver for Linux, and then reload the driver and reboot the system.\n\nA: Don't go to the NVidia site to download their driver, as you'll never get rid of it in the future.\nThe standard Ubuntu NVidia drivers generate some problems on slightly older and slightly newer NVidia hardware.\nIf you want more then the standard Ubuntu repository drivers, install the xorg.edgers PPA.

I don't think there were any obvious upgrades to account for it (I run the updater every morning).\nGrateful for any help with this.\n\nA: It could be an actual font that's gone bad, maybe taking a look at that font with something like gnome-font-viewer to check, possibly reisntall the font?\nBut, that's almost exactly what used to happen when I ran earler versions of gnome3 (I think that's still the base for Unity), only it had more letters completely gone and a few other graphic errors here & there. Some programs would look normal, though. Later updated versions of gnome3 were fixed.\nI'm suspecting there was an update that's causing this problem now, is there a way you can \"roll back\" any recent updates (maybe from before the last reboot, in case it could have updated but showed no errors until after a reboot?) and see if the problem goes away? Or first might as well check for any new updates that may fix it?\nAnd trying a different window manager may be a potential workaround, and could verify if it is a WM (gnome3-ish) display issue at least. Openbox is quite small, or possibly xfce4 or icewm, jwm. lxde if you already like pcmanfm, (but I don't see the lxde window manager on it's own).\n", "Q: Install Adobe Acrobat XI with wine Adobe Acrobat XI has a silver rating on WineHQ, meaning it should work, right?\nI right click acrobat.exe, and the installation wizard pops up and installs successfully with no errors. However, I tick the 'open application' box at the end of the installation and...nothing happens.\nAdobe Acrobat isn't appearing in my list of installed apps.

Could someone explain what he means by use winetricks atmlib , and copy the acrobat folder into proper .wine folder. Could someone guide me through those steps slowly? Thanks. Greatly appreciated, really want to get acrobat working :)\n\nA: I'm the person who wrote the first test results of Adobe Acrobat XI Pro on Wine App database.\nYou can't install the program using current, official Wine release. If you want install it with - and only with - Wine, you will need a MSI \"hack patch\" which bypasses some custom MSI action calls required basically by any modern Adobe installer.\nThe patch for Wine is provided here\nThe downside is that, at the moment, the patch is rejected from official Wine mainstream releases. However, you can apply it to Wine source code and compile Wine by yourself. After you've compiled Wine and installed it into your system, you should be able to install Adobe Acrobat XI Pro without issues. The patch works also for other Adobe software, such as\n\n\n*\n\n*Adobe Audition (CS5.5 & CS6)\n\n*Adobe Premiere Pro CS3\n\n\n(Wine 1.7.36 + patch applied)\nI've compared/analyzed the first installation method I described on Wine AppDB (\"Copy all files from Windows OS\"), and the \"MSI hack patch\" method. Both of them work: all needed Acrobat files are installed, whichever method you decide to use.\nWinetricks requirements for the patch method are as follows:\nwinetricks msxml3 msxml6 wininet ie8 vcrun6 atmlib\n\nOn winecfg, set your Windows version to \"Windows 7\", before running the Acrobat Installer.\nIf  you have troubles with printing in Acrobat XI Pro, set riched20 override to \"builtin\" instead of \"native\" on winecfg.\nI hope this information helps you.\n\nA: Install the atmlib library by running the following in the terminal:\nsudo winetricks atmlib\n\nAs for copying the folder over, this refers to a bug in Acrobat's installer which prevents it from copying the folders into the relevant directory. The alternative is to copy the folders from a windows computer that already has Acrobat installed on it. However, it sounds like you managed to install Acrobat.\n\nA: Not an answer to this question, but I gave up on installing Acrobat and instead installed Foxit Reader.

In some cases (with root permissions against a target in a different subnet) the ICMP echo request is used, but it would never be used against targets on the same AP as the scanner, unless you explicitly use the --disable-arp-ping option.\nFor reasons I'll get to later, I would guess that you are not running this scan with root (sudo) privileges. In this case, Nmap's host discovery is implemented by trying to connect to TCP ports 80 and 443; if either of these is rejected or accepted, the host is considered to be \"up.\" If the connections time out (which can happen with a firewalled system), then the host is marked \"down.\"\nIf you were running with root privilege, Nmap would send an ARP request to determine the MAC address of the IP you are targeting. Answering this kind of request is a requirement to being connected on an Ethernet or wireless LAN, so it is pretty much guaranteed to work. If you are using sudo and still not getting a response, then you should probably file a bug report with the Nmap project (dev@nmap.org).\n\nA: Well, i thInk that this is not the place for you to ask, but, I will answer you. If you use -Pn it will treat all the hosts as online. Every time that the host is down, i use -Pn. Example:\nnmap -Pn 192.168.1.*\n\n(Sorry for bad English)\n", "Q: Making use of awk on string I'm interested in listing in the terminal the lines from a csv file where the first character is 'A' .

I use \"reprepro\" for getting the latest Debian packages out of my local repository, which works fine manually.\nNow I need to automate this process through a cron job but the reprepro passphrase is a prompt.\nIs there any possibility to send the password via bash script? Couldn't find anything in the reprepro manpage.\n\nA: I needed the same thing and was looking for solution. Apart from running gpg-agent, which will ask for the password only once (e.g. during boot) and cache it for next usage, I have found nothing.\nProblem is how to interact with interactive scripts, which are the ones, who ask for user input from stdin. Expect (apt-get install expect) solves exactly that. \nThis is the script I wrote and saved in /usr/local/bin/reprepro_expect:\n#!/usr/bin/expect -f\nset timeout 2\nset passphrase \"mysupersecretpassword\"\n\nspawn reprepro -b [lindex $argv 0] [lindex $argv 1] [lindex $argv 2] [lindex $argv 3]\nexpect {\n        \"*passphrase:*\" {\n                send -- \"$passphrase\\r\"\n        }\n}\nexpect {\n        \"*passphrase:*\" {\n                send -- \"$passphrase\\r\"\n        }\n}\ninteract\n\nYou can run it like this:\nreprepro_expect [path_to_repository] [command] [distribution] [package_name]\nFor example:\nAdd new package:\nreprepro_expect /var/www/myrepo includedeb wheezy mypackage_0.1-1_all.deb\nDelete package\nreprepro_expect /var/www/myrepo remove wheezy mypackage\nSecurity:\nSince password to your private key is stored in the script, I recommend to chown it to user, under which it will be used and chmod it to 500. Why isn't passphrase passed as another argument? Because it would be stored in ~/.bash_history and it would show in ps axu during runtime.\n\nA: As mentioned in other answers, expect can solve this problem. I ended up with something like this, save as reprepro.exp and make it executable with chmod 755 reprepro.exp\n#!/usr/bin/expect -f\n\nset timeout 5\n\nset passphrase \"$env(SIGNING_PASSWORD)\"\n\n# Call reprepro with variable length arguments, so that this script\n# takes the same arguments as the original program\nspawn reprepro {*}$argv\n\nexpect {\n    timeout                     {send_error \"\\nFailed to get password prompt\\n\";\n                                 exit 1}\n    \"Please enter passphrase*\"  {send -- \"$passphrase\\r\";\n                                 send_user \" *** entering passphrase ***\";\n                                 exp_continue}\n}\n\n# Get the pid, spawnid, oserr and exitcode from the spawned reprepro command\nset returnvalues [wait]\n\n# Extract the reprepro exit code\nset exitcode [lindex $returnvalues 3]\n\n# Exit with the exitcode from reprepro (0 on success)\nexit $exitcode\n\nHaving one expect statement means that this will also work (i.e. not crash) if the password is wrong. Then gpg will ask for the passphrase three times and reprepro will return an exit code that is not 0.\nYou can export the environment variable SIGNING_PASSWORD in your .bashrc or replace it in the script with the real password or do something else. Use the appropriate level of security that you need.\n\nA: My working code. I echo the scipt inside an other bashscript into a file and open it then.\n#!/usr/bin/expect -f\nset timeout 5\nspawn reprepro -v -b $SCRIPT_DIR/repository/ubuntu includedeb $UBUNTUVERSION $DEBFILE\nexpect {\n    timeout                     {send_error \\\"\\\\nFailed to get password prompt\\\\n\\\";\n                                 exit 1}\n    \\\"Pass*\\\"  {send -- \\\"$KEYPASSWD\\\\r\\\";\n                                 send_user \\\" *** entering passphrase ***\\\";\n                                 exp_continue}\n}\n# Get the pid, spawnid, oserr and exitcode from the spawned reprepro command\nset returnvalues [wait]\n\n# Extract the reprepro exit code\nset exitcode [lindex $returnvalues 3]\n\n# Exit with the exitcode from reprepro (0 on success)\nexit $exitcode\n\nDon't forget to run the command update-alternatives --set pinentry /usr/bin/pinentry-tty >/dev/null || gpg-connect-agent reloadagent /bye >/dev/null, so reprepro does not want to open a graphical user input!\n\nA: This Answer is for ansible users.\nI had the same problem, I created a dummy file, encrypted it, and used the gpg-agent to cache the password like suggested by mkudlacek, but with the ansible expect module. I used the following tasks:\n- name: create test.txt, created a dummy file\n  file:\n    path: /test.txt\n    state: touch\n    mode: u=rw,g=rw,o=rw #!!! just for testing purposes\n\n - name: encrypt file\n   expect:\n     command: gpg --pinentry-mode loopback --sign /test.txt\n     responses: 'Enter passphrase:': '{{ your_pw }}'\n     timeout: 60\n\nYou can add now the Reprepro Packages via a separate Task and delete the test.txt file.\n", "Q: Input Not Supported Xubuntu 12.04 LTS Need Help with my Machine Because Every time I turn on my machine I always get this error Input Not Supported and it takes a little bit of time then immediately it will pop directly to user login.. what should i do to fix this issue? \n\nA: When the computer first boots, do you see the BIOS/POST screen ok? Then what happens, and how long is the \"input not supported\" message displayed? Like 1-3 seconds, or a half-minute plus?\nIf it's a second or three, maybe Ubuntu/Xubuntu has changed display modes too fast for your monitor to keep up, but it catches up when the login screen shows up. My monitor flips & flickers for about two seconds right before it logins in.\nUpdate: 30 second delay... That is a long time, sounds about as long as the startup messages would take (like the log messages if you boot without the quiet splash options) - As if your splash screen were in an unsupported resolution. What happens if you boot without the quiet splash options?

I'm putting Ubuntu on this USB so I can use it anywhere, on anybody's computer - my portable work station. It could be old and crappy, or new and beefy.\nThe problems now are to do with hardware (I assume) when I use the installed Ubuntu on a computer other than that which I installed it on.\nThere are graphical glitches, serious display bugs, random errors (like it freezing up when trying to search for an application (Terminal) to open), and more.

If you want to see all the windows on all workspaces, hold Shift+Super, then hit W. \nHolding Super will bring up Unity's keyboard shortcut list, where these commands and other similar ones are listed.

Please get a working internet connection and copy and paste these commands, each one at a time.\nsudo apt-get install build-essential linux-headers-generic git\ngit clone https://github.com/lwfinger/rtl8192du.git\ncd rtl8192du\nmake\nsudo make install\nsudo modprobe 8192du\n\nYou probably also need to load the firmware:\nsudo cp ~/rtl8192du/rtl8192dufw*  /lib/firmware/rtlwifi\nsudo depmod -a\n\nIt may take a reboot. Your wireless should now be working. Please let us know as we will have one additional step.\n\nA: You mentioned that you had wired internet before, but when you got this wireless adapter, did you get a wireless router with it as well? If you know the name of your wireless network and the security key (if it applies), do you see an icon in the upper right that appears as a pie shape (that's the best way I can describe it)? That would be the wireless icon. If you click there, does the card list any networks around you at all? That'd be a good starting point, and indicate you at least have some type of connection with the USB stick, and that'd give us a step in the right direction.\nI found some information that may be useful... I wouldn't consider it very user-friendly, but try the following, and let me know if it at least works for you.\nI downloaded the driver package from here. Belkin doesn't make their own chip on the inside of that USB stick, but the actual chip is a Realtek RTL8192SU-GR. You'll see where it says Unix/Linux, download from one of the mirror links. The next thing you'll want to do is to extract it anywhere, perhaps the desktop, just so you can get to the folder. Next, open a terminal, and get to where that file is. There is an install script, but you'll have to make it run. At the command prompt, type in:\n\n$ sudo -i\n$ cd ~/desktop/ (where  is that folder you saved to the\n  desktop)\n$ chmod 775 install.sh\n$ sudo ./install.sh\n\nIt should follow the script and install itself, similar to how some things have to be installed in Windows. It should work I believe, from what I see here at least.\nLet me know if you are still struggling.\n", "Q: HDMI ports stopped working on 14.04 updates Situation is that my zotac box only has an hdmi port for the monitor, so this problem is hard to trouble shoot.

You just need to add the linux-firmware-nonfree package for the firmware. And most important, clean out all the other broadcom stuff you installed.  Much of that will suppress the working of the b43 driver.  Check for any exact lines like \"blacklist b43\" in any files in /etc/modprobe.d and delete them. At least that's how it used to work, things do change and I no longer have a machine with such a chip.  The firmware should be put into /lib/firmware/b43, if nothing shows up, you probably need to fall back to the b43-fwcutter package to \"cut\" out the firmware from a broadcom driver.  Search around here for solutions, there are many.

I recently switched to Ubuntu. One of the tools I frequently used was XAMPP. When I installed LAMP stack on Ubuntu I noticed a major performance increase and was quite please with it. However, after literally spending days and reading dozen of how-to articles, I still couldn't set it up right.\nI ended up installing apache2 + php5-fpm because it cane execute the files with the permissions of the user.\nHowever that didn't still quite work out for me. For example, I downloaded an archive of a popular CMS and extracted it to apache html directory. The resulting permissions on those files are 0664 and 0700 on folders.\nApache directory rules:\n<Directory \"/home/myuser/www/\">\n    AllowOverride All\n    Require all granted\n    Allow from all    \n</Directory>\n\nWhen AllowOverride All:\n[Fri Dec 12 21:16:01.037580 2014] [core:crit] [pid 23745:tid 140466931369728] \n(13)Permission denied: [client 127.0.0.1:54670] AH00529:  \n/home/myuser/www/mycms/install/.htaccess pcfg_openfile: unable to check htaccess \nfile, ensure it is readable and that '/home/myuser/www/mycms/install/' is executable\n\nWhen AllowOverride None, apache2 runs index.php which is at root directory, but won't run /config/index.php\n[Fri Dec 12 21:02:41.552369 2014] [core:error] [pid 22530:tid 140517706823424]\n(13)Permission denied: [client 127.0.0.1:54465] AH00035: access to \n/install/index.php denied (filesystem path \n'/home/myuser/www/mycms/install/index.php') because search \npermissions are missing on a component of the path\n\nI'm not too well-versed in apache directory rules yet, maybe there is some error in there.

However, I can't keep running this command every time I add some files or when they are created by php. Isn't there a way to work without constantly tampering with the permissions? I asked a colleague and he just said: \"Set the root user for php5-fpm service\". However, this is more of a make-shift escape solution. I am also afraid that I may run some glob/* functions and delete files which I didn't mean to delete (has happened to me in the past).\nHow can I set up my LAMP stack to automatically be able to run all my files?\nIf there is good guide on how to set it up with suphp or some other mod, I would hapilly look at it.

The thing is that once I open the terminal on Pc_A and I connect to Pc_B I'm no longer capable of transferring data from one computer to another...  \nQuestion: does anyone have the idea of what should be done in such case?\n\nA: You could use scp:\nWhen you're on PCB:\nscp -r your_user_name@ip_address_of_PCA:/path/to/remote/directory /path/to/local/directory\n\n\nA: On PC A, instead of connecting to PC B by ssh, just run\nrsync /path/to/local/file username@PCB:/path/to/remote/destination\n\nYou could also use scp instead of rsync, with similar formatting for the rest of the line, but I prefer rsync, since it's more powerful, and (I think) verifies after copying. See man rsync for more details. N.B. that the remote computer must have rsync installed too (see comments by neon_overload), otherwise scp would be preferred.\nIf installed on both computers, rsync will take advantage of the processing power of both.

Problem was from power outages, was getting the error on boot, over rode the setting in BIOS to ignore the issue.  Knew should have just zeroed out the drive, but was lazy and now am screwed.\nNow Ubuntu cannot read the hard drive, BIOS does, but shows it as 0mb.  I have in the past did save hard drives by doing a zero fill via the manufactures software, this was way back when the software came on a floppy disk when you bought the hard drive.\nThe hard drive is partitioned off, 3 ext4 one being for ubuntu, another for android-x86 and the third for backup, the other is a ntfs for windows.\nI really don't care about recovering the files, just want to be able to zero fill the drive to see if this would save it, either by using the dd if=/dev/sdx of=/zero or using the WD software provided on western digital's website.  Yes know that a new HDD is needed, working on it, just would like to see if it can be done for knowledge reasons.\nCan't quite figure out how to make a bootable USB stick, since I am not using windows and do not have access to a windows PC.  Right now using Ubuntu installed on a USB stick, this link doesn't help since blkd isn't seeing the corrupted drive.\nTried a few partition programs, gparted, parted, gdisk, fdisk, testdisk, they are not seeing the drive.  Installed FreeDos using netbootin and tried getting the manufacture software to work, but not really familiar with dos commands, pretty much forgot them all over the years.  Netbootin also isn't letting me make a bootable USB stick, rufus is supposed to work, installing wine to see if it will let me do it.\n\nA: Once a hard drive starts to fail , you will start to have problems. You can continue to use the drive for some time, by re-formatting it, etc as you suggest.\nThe drive may have some life in it, for example, I used a drive like this for over a year. Just make sure you have reliable back ups.\nSometimes (rarely) they fail gradually, but eventually the drive will completely fail. Total failure will occur without any additional warning (the only warning you have is the need to re-format, write all 0's, etc in the first place).\nI assume from what you posted you are now at the point of total failure. Even if you somehow squeeze some life out of the drive I would not expect it to function for more then a day or two at the most.\nMaking a live usb is easy see http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/create-a-usb-stick-on-ubuntu or unetbootin if you are running windows http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/create-a-usb-stick-on-windows .\n", "Q: Need help with wireless driver for Lenovo E545 (Realtek RLT8188ee I am having trouble with getting my wifi to work. I installed ubuntu alongside windows 8.1 (Its really weird, I choose UEFI mode to go into windows and legacy mode to go into Ubuntu 12.04). Anyhow the only internet that I can get is a wired internet connection and my home wifi (I added that when installing). There is no wifi icon in the top bar but I am connected to our home wifi because I can load webpages. The driver I would need is Realtek RLT8188ee, which has no linux variation available. I tried this guide here Wireless not working on Toshiba Satellite C55-A5281 . \nEvery thing was fine until I ran the make and sudo make install commands.

How do I fix the driver? I'm not the most advanced in Ubuntu so if you could break things down a little more, or even explain what it does that would be great.\nOh and this is AMD architecture \nAs asked by chili555 I ran those commands and pasted the results here: http://paste.ubuntu.com/9503274/  The first block was the first command and so on and so forth.\n\nThought I'd give an update: The wifi is now working after I ran updates and restarted. I still cannot see wifi options and status in the top bar, but i can see it in settings->network.\nSorry to waste your time.\n\nA: Although the link you gave asks that you compile backports-3.11, you compiled the much older and incompatible backports-3.2. In fact, rtl8188ee is included in Ubuntu 14.04, which uses kernel 3.13, by default! There is no need to compile anything: \nubuntu@ubuntu:~$ modinfo rtl8188ee\nfilename:       /lib/modules/3.13.0-24-generic/kernel/drivers/net/wireless/rtlwifi/rtl8188ee/rtl8188ee.ko\nfirmware:       rtlwifi/rtl8188efw.bin\ndescription:    Realtek 8188E 802.11n PCI wireless\nlicense:        GPL\n\nPlease give us some diagnostics so we may see what is going wrong:\nlspci -nn | grep 0280\nrfkill list all\ndmesg | grep rtl\n\nAs the results may be lengthy, please paste them here and give us the link: http://paste.ubuntu.com. I will then edit this answer to propose a solution.\n\nA: Apparently, the driver was working better a few releases ago, so the backport driver was not that bad of a suggestion.  I tried it, and it worked better than the one in the 3.13.0-32 kernel. However, the new driver that Larry Finger has seems to work far better than either one.

This will not uninstall the application.\nTo uninstall, you'll have to manually remove the files. You can't use apt-get or the software centre, because Feem was not installed by Ubuntu's package manager. I've looked at the installer code, and I can see three locations where it installed to.

DivX is a company name and a trademark, but not a particular codec. Initially it was some flavour of H.263, then H.264 and the latest entry is H.265.\nChrome should by default be able to play H.264 content on Ubuntu.

I'm currently using VPNBook with OpenVPN. I just recently learned about DNS leaking. Is there a way to scan for it?\n\nA: \nOpenVPN won't assign server's DNS resolver(s) if you run it from\n  terminal. This is a known behavior and until OpenVPN developers fix\n  it, you have to run an external script to assign the DNS resolvers\n  once the tunnel is connected, and revert when disconnected. This\n  should work on Ubuntu, Debian, and any Debian based distros.\nStep 1\nFirst, you have to update the .ovpn profiles to run a script that\n  will assign a DNS resolver and restore your original resolver when\n  the VPN connection will shut-down. Add the following lines to the\n  .ovpn file:\nscript-security 2  \nup updatedns.sh  \ndown updatedns.sh\n\nNote that this applies if you run openvpn [server profile.ovpn] from\n  the current folder, not eg.\nopenvpn /home/myself/Downloads/openvpn-profiles/server-location.ovpn \n\nIf you run from different folder, you will have to include the full\n  path accordingly (also to the mass-update command below)\nTo mass-update all .ovpn profiles in a folder, unzip the server\n  profiles, then from the same folder run:\nfor filename in *.ovpn; do  echo -e \"script-security 2\\nup updatedns.sh\\ndown updatedns.sh\" >> $filename; done\n\nStep 2\nGet the updatedns.sh script:\nwget https://vpn.ac/configs/misc/updatedns.sh\n\nRun chmod +x updatedns.sh to make it executable Step 3\nConnect by running:\nopenvpn ./[location-profile].ovpn\n\nOnce connected, check dnsleak test. It should report our DNS\n  resolvers.\nWhen you disconnect, the original resolv.conf will be restored.\n  If anything goes wrong it it doesn't restore properly (ie. openvpn\n  process killed), restore it manually by running:\ncp -a /etc/resolv.conf.orig /etc/resolv.conf \n\n\nSource:VPN.AC\n", "Q: How to get back hosts file after accidental deletion I made a mistake and accidentally deleted hosts file from my system and cannot figure out how to get back my hosts (/etc/) file, when i do\nsudo service apache2 restart\n\nit's showing sudo: unable to resolve host SystemName.\nI am using ubunt 14.04 Lts Please help me out, i am just beginner.\nI tried by sudo vi hosts and put\n127.0.0.1       localhost\n::1             localhost ip6-localhost ip6-loopback\nfe00::0         ip6-localnet\nff00::0         ip6-mcastprefix\nff02::1         ip6-allnodes\nff02::2         ip6-allrouters\n\nbut no avail\n\nA: This is the contents of my /etc/hosts.

I think its not problem as the installed software is working properly, but mentioning.\nAny faced this problem recently ? \nAny solution ?\n\nA: It sounds to me as as though something is interfering with your internet speed.  Several causes are possible.  If you have cable as opposed to FIOS, comcast in particular is well known for dialing back your performance if you exceed their predetermined expectations of your \"unlimited internet\".\nOther possibilities include wifi interference if you are using wifi.  If a neighbor installs a new wifi router and it is on the same radio frequency channel, especially a popular default one like 6 or 11 and that's what you have, the interference will cause internet dropouts.  To diagnose that I recommend installing \"WIFI RADAR\" and letting it sit for at least 30 minutes to see what channels are being used near you.  When you find out, you can log into your wifi router and manually change your channel.\nAlso if you have a cell phone or cordless phone handy... like the rest of us, please try to keep it as far from your wifi device and router as possible as it too can result in slowness.\nI'm guessing one of these is right, and if so, please tell me which one worked for you.\n\nA: i used to solve it with forcing flash player instead of html5 - eventhough you have flash plugin installed, many websites turned to html5 by default.\nthere used to be an option on youtube.com/html5 to turn on/off the html5 player, but nowdays its gone. try to use some browser plugin which forces to use flash instead of html5\n", "Q: Dota 2 lag spikes I've been getting some pretty bad lag spikes in Dota 2.

I am on wired connection as well. How can I fix this?\n\nA: Well first of all you must stop all the downloads running in the back because they would be consuming bandwidth and you will experience lag. I would recommend using Kill Ping. \nIt is an online gaming application which provides a dedicated gaming route to its users to the game server. This dedicated route enables the game data to bypass the clutter and all the traffic on a regular internet connection increasing the data transfer rate enhancing the ping rate and eliminating packet loss. \nIt is working fine on Dota 2 as I haven't played any other game on it. Might help you to solve your problem as well. It will also show you the spike before and after and all the complete stats of your network so you would actually see how much it improved your connection.

Any ideas?\n\nA: ...why? Probably there is a better solution, so if you state why probably we can suggests some more sound solutions. Remember that the shell is used not only by users, but also by a lot system processes. \nAnyway, bash (the default shell) when starts it will (but see later) execute a series of system-wide scripts. The shell can start as interactive or non-interactive, and as login or non-login shell (see man bash and search for \"INVOCATION\" for details). \nBasically, when a user starts a shell in a terminal in a graphic session, bash is invoked as interactive, non-login shell and will execute /etc/bash.bashrc:\n\nWhen  an  interactive  shell that is not a login shell is started,\n  bash\n         reads and executes commands from  /etc/bash.bashrc  and  ~/.bashrc,  if\n         these  files  exist.  This may be inhibited by using the --norc option.\n         The --rcfile file option will force bash to read and  execute  commands\n         from file instead of /etc/bash.bashrc and ~/.bashrc.\n\nSo you can add commands there. Be careful though, errors here can make your system very hard to recover.\nexecutive summary (tested)\nEdit /etc/bash.bashrc and, AFTER the line that says \n# If not running interactively, don't do anything\n[ -z \"$PS1\" ] && return\n\nadd for example: \necho \"Hello $USER, you started a new shell\"\n\nand from a terminal: \n[romano:~] % bash\nHello romano, you started a new shell\nromano@RRyS:~$\n\nIf you want to run a script here, be careful and double check, like \nif [ -x /full/path/to/script ]; then \n     /full/path/to/script  # double check here \nfi\n\ndouble check that /full/path/to/script does not call bash in interactive mode, or you'll have a nice endless loop here. \ncaveat:\nThis is not at all enforced: \nother shells (zsh, tcsh, dash) will behave differently and will use different files. And obviously any user can call the shell with \nbash --norc --noprofile \n\nand have the script files skipped. \n\nThere is even an example in the 14.04 /etc/bash.bashrc (probably a remnant from when Ubuntu switched to sudo...) to hint the user to use sudo instead of logging in as root:  \n# sudo hint\nif [ ! -e \"$HOME/.sudo_as_admin_successful\" ] && [ ! -e \"$HOME/.hushlogin\" ] ; then\n    case \" $(groups) \" in *\\ admin\\ *)\n    if [ -x /usr/bin/sudo ]; then\n        cat <<-EOF\n        To run a command as administrator (user \"root\"), use \"sudo <command>\".\n        See \"man sudo_root\" for details.\n\n        EOF\n    fi\n    esac\nfi\n\n...but this is code archeology ;-).\n\nA: I'm not sure what you mean by 'run at all times', so I can't answer that part, but for the rest.\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/EnvironmentVariables has a great explanation under the 'System-wide environment variables' section.\nBut here's what you need to know. Login shells and interactive non-login shells are controlled by different files. So if you want your script to run when ALL shells are started, you will need to source your script in both places, or place it in both places.\nMake a script run when any login shell is executed:\n\nQuote from the above source: Files with the .sh extension in the /etc/profile.d directory get executed whenever a bash login shell is entered (e.g. when logging in from the console or over ssh), as well as by the DisplayManager when the desktop session loads.\n\nSo simply place your script in the /etc/profile.d directory, and give it a .sh extension.\nMake a script run when any interactive non-login shell is executed:\nPretty much the same as before, except this time it's not a directory, but a file.\n/etc/bash.bashrc will be sourced when any interactive non-login shell is executed. This means you can either place the contents of your script directly in /etc/bash.bashrc, or you can source your script from there. If your script is located in /etc/myscript.sh you can source it by adding the source /etc/myscript.sh to the /etc/bash.bashrc file.\n", "Q: can't access to a folder even after chmod 777 I just created a new user, and I want to give access to a folder.\nI have done:\nchmod -R 777 ./p\n\nand this is the result\nlisa@linux:/media$ ls -halt\ndrwxr-xr-x  27 root      root   4,0K dic 11 11:57 ..\ndrwxrwxrwx+  3 pierpaolo utenti 4,0K dic  8 23:48 p\ndrwxr-xr-x   3 root      root   4,0K set 10 12:20 .\nlrwxrwxrwx   1 root      root     45 ago  5 01:22 .directory -> /etc/kubuntu-default-settings/directory-media\n\nBut still, i can not cd in to the folder (permission denied).

If a parent directory has no execute permission for some user, then that user cannot stat any subdirectories regardless of the permissions on those subdirectories.\nExample:\n$ ls -l cake\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 zanna zanna 4096 Jul 12 11:43 brownies\n$ chmod 666 cake\n$ ls -l cake/brownies\nls: cannot access 'cake/brownies': Permission Denied\n\nEven though I am the owner of the directory 'brownies' and all users have permission to read and enter it, I can't access it if its parent directory has no execute permission.\nIt's better to use groups to manage permissions than give to give directories 777 permission.\n\nA: acl are not exactly unix/linux standard.

At present I'm using grub installed by Ubuntu.\nI would like to replace it by installing Arch's grub.\nMy question is: Will Ubuntu updates break or replace Grub especially when installing kernel updates? Or will it simply ignore the grub installation?\nI'm aware that I would need to update Grub from Arch when Ubuntu has a new kernel.\n\nA: I don't see a big problem with MBR installations.\nYou would overwrite the GRUB code in MBR with the one from Arch and load Arch's grub.cfg instead of Ubuntu's. Both ideally should be in /boot/grub/grub.cfg on their respective root partitions, so that every OS has it's own grub.cfg that it can maintain independently. To jump to the configuration of the other OS, you could include the following code (replace 848acb77-de99-4288-a62b-2bf9d7fbd643 and hd0,gpt2 with appropriate values for the other root filesystem) into /etc/grub.d/40_custom or what ever mechanism Arch uses and run the script responsible for updating grub.cfg (update-grub in Ubuntu):\nmenuentry 'Custom Title' {\n    search.fs_uuid 848acb77-de99-4288-a62b-2bf9d7fbd643 root hd0,gpt2\n    set prefix=($root)'/boot/grub'\n    configfile $prefix/grub.cfg\n}\n\nOf course you shouldn't mix architectures like i386/ia32 with x64/amd64 or x64/amd64 with x64-efi/amd64-efi. Speaking of EFI, with EFI it's even simpler, as every bootloader should use it's own directory to not overwrite each other anymore.\nOn MBR installations you should make sure that only one system is able to update the MBR, see odfred's answer on how to do that. But it shouldn't be much of an issue when you can jump from one config to the other.\n", "Q: Wifi is not working with some router in ubuntu 14.04, my laptop is lenovo ideapad s510p I bought a Lenovo ideapad s510p 3 months back, am facing some wifi issues.

You only need to watch out not to assign the same IP address the windows machine has assigned itself (you can check it running ipconfig in CMD).\nI hope that helps!\n", "Q: Bitlocker like software for Ubuntu Is there a tool like the Bitlocker to encrypt the whole Ubuntu partition?

Looking at other options I found the OS that I have Currently which is Ubuntu 0.140.1 Recently my Computer told me that I needed to upgrade to 0.140.2. My issue is that when ever I go to do it that the system warns me that my tiny Graphics card cant support this new version. now to my questions: Is there an Ubuntu or Linix OS that I can get that will not have this issue at some point? What is it? How can I get it?  \n\nA: If your system is low end then you can use lubuntu which is made for low end pc and laptop.It is similar to ubuntu in functionality.You can download iso from here .\n\nA: I am running Ubuntu 14.04 32 bit on my Acer Aspire One ZG5, which is a 1.5gb RAM netbook. Very slow compared to smartphones and tablets now, but it is still functional. I installed from USB, since the ZG5 has no CD/DVD.\nIt takes time to open applications. It can still stream video from Netflix, but lags from Youtube due to the ads. I love using this computer, even though my tablet and smartphone are faster. \nSo, to answer your question, you should be able to run Ubuntu 14.04 on your Acer Aspire.

Apparently on the mate-desktop forums a user found a fix for this, and as it seems it looks to be a 64bit only issue. I cannot figure out how to apply this fix to remastersys-gtk. I use the precise version here as the 14.04 version by mutse doesn't have a working gtk version. Can anyone help me apply this fix? As it seems to be an issue with 64bit users using 14.04 onwards.\n\nA: Actually I figured it out, I was having a brain fart when I posted this so I'm not that stupid if you think I am. The issue was that the CD Label name was too long for remastersys' liking, and I doubt it's a 64bit issue only. Easily fixable just condense the CD Label.\nPS AskUbuntu won't let me claim this as an answer but this is the correct answer. This question should be closed now not in 2 days imo.\n", "Q: How safe encfs encrypted files are Just recently got interested in encryption and some things are unclear. Say my ubuntu user is password protected and i have an encrypted folder. Now let's say someone takes my laptop, checks if i have encfs installed and because i have, he knows there are some encrypted files on the laptop. How hard would it be for that someone to get to those files?\nThe user password is fairly easy to bypass. I have read this https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FolderEncryption and as much as i understand that someone would have to know the location of the enrypted and visible folders and since he's already bypassed the user password he could also access those files using an encfs command right?\n\nA: At first, I am recommending to use the manual command: man encfs. The encfs command makes an encrypted filesystem.\nIn case of Single password mode configuration it doesn't matter how strong is your filesystem encryption, if the hacker crack your easy login password. He will be also able to access your filesystem.\nThere are different cases when you have separate passwords for the login and the encrypted files/partitions, etc.\n\n*\n\n*The whole SSD/HDD encrypted. In that case the attacker cannot access your file until he cracks your encFS password. In that case your user password is also encrypted.\n\n\n*Another case when the system partitions are not encrypted, but there are files/partitions which are. So in this scenario, an attacker can mount your sys partitions and may have access to your hashed, or encrypted password (by a password hash algorithm). But the attacker will not able to read your encrypted files/partitions until he brute forces the password of the encFS.\nTo answer your question:\nIf you used the laptop in Single Password mode with weak password, the likelihood is high, because you reused the weak password.\nIf you used 2 passwords and the encFS password is strong, it would be very hard to get those file.\nFurther information:\nhttps://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/EncFS\n\nA: The encfs files are encrypted independently of your user account. This being said, if someone has access to your file system because of a weak user password, he could install some malware (keylogger or something).\nFurthermore, there are known securioty issues with encfs, especially if someone can get various versions of your encfs encrypted files (which might be possible in this case).\n", "Q: Already dual booting windows and ubuntu but want to install latest ubuntu on another hard drive so currently I'm already dual booting windows and ubuntu. I've bought a new hard drive where I want to install the latest ubuntu but I want to keep my current setup whilst I make the transition to my new ubuntu installation. After that, I want to delete my ubuntu partition from the dual booting hard drive to just keep windows.\nSo essentially in the end, I'd end up with 1 hard drive with windows 7 and 1 hard drive with ubuntu. How would I go about doing this? How would I setup grub? I'm very new to this stuff, so any help appreciated.\n\nA: I actually just ran the  live cd and installed ubuntu on my new harddrive with all my other hard drives plugged in.

At this point it seems likely that the problems stem from the GTK controls with scrollbars being the most noteworthy as the content in the scrollbar will flicker and scroll back to a previous position. The issue also occurs when opening directories or clicking on files in Nautilus and will continue to flicker every time the cursor is moved and will only stop if I press any of the mouse buttons.\nThese problems only occur when I am using the 2560x1080 resolution and stop if I switch to 1920x1080 or any lower resolution.\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: I have found the solution to this problem and will proceed with how I came to solve the issue. The problem was not caused by the Nvidia driver or GTK like I originally thought but was due to an old bug in Compiz to do with the screen refresh rate on Nvidia cards as pointed out by Mateusz Stachowski on Google+ who also provided a link to the bug report on launchpad.\nThe bug report had a potential fix proposed by Christopher Townsend on comment number #329 in which he provided a link to a PPA to patch the bug in Compiz (apparently the patch cannot be applied to the official Compiz package due to licensing issues).\nTo apply the patch simply add the PPA to your repository, then update and restart your system.\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:townsend/compiz-nvidia-refresh-test\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade\nsudo reboot\n\n\nThis bug has now been fixed in the most recent version of Compiz as of 1:0.9.11.3+14.04.20150122-0ubuntu1 and the patch above is not longer necessary to fix the issue. Source\nThe officially fixed package can be installed by running:\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install compiz\n\nor by running a standard update of Ubuntu with:\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\n", "Q: What is the difference between compiz-plugins and compiz-plugins-extra? Which should I install? Over the past couple years when I've been looking at guides for installing ccsm (compiz config settings manager) I've seen some of them suggesting the package compiz-plugins for extra plugins and some recommend compiz-plugins-extra but I've never really seen both recommended.\nI was wondering if it is as simple as it sounds and compiz-plugins-extra contains more additional plugins than compiz-plugins? And my primary question, other than the difference between the two packages, is it safe to install both?\nThanks.\n\nA: Yes, Compiz Extra are indeed extra plugings. There is a fundamental difference between the 2 sets though: Compiz plugins are the core plugins (these are installed by default and are considered must haves for a well working Compiz) and  Compiz Extra hold the fun extra's so these are seen as not necessary but might be useful to a more than average audience. \nThe Compiz Extra plugins are ...\n\n\n*\n\n*3D Windows - Make windows rise above the surface of the Desktop Cube as it rotates.\n\n*ADD Helper -Darken every other window to help yourself concentrate on what you're working on now.\n\n*Benchmark -See exactly how smoothly Compiz can run on your system by showing the number of frames being rendered per second.\n\n*Crash handler - See a debugging backtrace when Compiz crashes. You may also specify a fall-back window manager to switch to in case Compiz crashes.\n\n*Cube Caps - Decorate the top and bottom faces of the cube with an image of your choice.\n6 .Cube Gears - Place the famous glxgears gears into the cube. The transparent cube option must be enabled for the gears to be visible.\n\n*Cube Reflection - Add a reflective ground to the Compiz Cube plugin.\n\n*Extra WM Actions - Use shortcut keys to toggle various states of the window, such being sticky or above other windows. There are other states as well, which are described in more detail on this plugin's page.\n\n*Error Notifications - Display messages from Compiz in the system notification area so that you don't need to run Compiz in a console to see them.\n\n*Fade to Desktop - Fade windows out to reveal the desktop.\n\n*Paint fire on the screen - Draw fire anywhere on your screen. You can continue to use your computer even as the fire is burning!\n\n*Group and Tab Windows - Arrange windows into groups to move and resize them all at the same time. You can also group related windows into a single, tabbed window to save space.\n\n*Login/Logout - Smoothly fade the desktop in or out when you login and logout.\nMaximumize - Make a window just large enough to fill unoccupied screen space without overlapping any more windows.\n\n*Motion blur - See a motion blur for different screen animations.\n\n*Reflection - Give translucent windows a reflective look by superimposing a reflection map over translucent regions.\n\n*Scale Window Title Filter - Add more functionality to the Scale plugin. Now you can \nsearch for windows in Scale mode by typing a part of a window's title.\n\n*Shelf -  Scale down individual windows to keep them out of your way, yet easily visible.\n\n*Show desktop -  Slide all windows toward the edges or corners of the screen to reveal the desktop.\n\n*Show mouse - Draw attention to your mouse cursor with trails of light and motion.\nSplash -  Show an animated logo image when Compiz starts.\n\n*Trailfocus - Leave a trail of progressively dimmer windows as you hop from window to window. This lets you see long it's been since you last focused a particular window.\n\n*Wallpaper - Use different backgrounds for different workspaces. Requires patches to Nautilus when using Gnome.\n\n*Widget Layer - Place windows of your choice onto a widget layer that can be shown or hidden with a shortcut key. It's a lot like OS X's Dashboard.\n\n", "Q: How to setup VirtualBox so I can access my guest system when I have no Internet My host runs Windows.

I want to know- is this integrated graphics card and if so, how do I found it out without opening my computer box?\n\nA: Motherboards very rarely have Nvidia integrated Graphics but the easiest way to find out would be to look at the back of the desktop and check if the monitor inputs are directly connected to the motherboard. This can easily be spotted by looking for a HDMI, DVI, DisplayPort, or VGA connector next to other inputs such as Ethernet, audio connectors and USB ports. If it is a card then it would be installed in one of the PCI slots usually situated near the bottom of the tower.\nAdmittedly because this answer doesn't really mention Ubuntu in any way it is sort of invalid in the context but it should still answer the question.\n", "Q: Deleting an entire line in a file that contains a certain string I'm interested in figuring out a way to delete an entire line in a text file that contains a particular string.

I want it to make a permanent change to the file\n\nA: You could use d command from sed.\nTo remove all lines containing word John, you would do\nsed --in-place /John/d ./file\n\nIn case of Multiple criterions, use the -e command\nsed --in-place -e '/John/d; /John Smith/d' ./file\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu installation does not start, windows boots first I have a HP Pavilion dv7 multimedia laptop with a Windows Vista installation that I don't want. All I want to do is to install Ubuntu 10.04 and get rid of windows. The BIOS boot order is set for the USB pendrive first, then the DVD ROM drive, then the hard disk, but windows always boots up first instead of the ubuntu 10.04 pendrive or ISO disk. This also happens with the boot repair disk. Start-up ignores the disk drive and loads windows.\nWhat might the problem/solution be? I am considering formatting all the hard disks on the laptop including the HP recovery disk to see if I can install ubuntu from scratch more easily but I'm worried that it might complicate what appears to be a relatively simple problem. Thanks in advance for your suggestions.\n\nA: Some BIOS enable you to choose where do you want to boot instead of following a priority, a common problem is that people change the priorities and forget to save.\nAnother thing that is common is that the dvds are badly burned, to avoid this you should install using a USB.\nVisit http://www.pendrivelinux.com/universal-usb-installer-easy-as-1-2-3/\nhere you can create a USB ready to use on all pcs without having to worry if the disk is ok or not.\n\nA: Can you disable booting from the HDD entirely in the BIOS (you can in mine, although it's a fairly recent Dell Inspiron Core i5 that I bought about a year ago, with a UEFI motherboard)?  If so, what happens if you do that?\nAnother idea is that often there is a 'boot options' menu you can go into as the PC is starting up (on mine you press F12), which allows you to choose where to boot from.  Maybe that could help?\nIf your system has Vista then I'm guessing it's not UEFI?\n", "Q: juju can not start lxc machine I am trying juj on an openvz VPS. when I try juju bootstrap it says:\nuploading tools for series [precise trusty]\nLogging to /home/danialbehzadi/.juju/local/cloud-init-output.log on remote host\nBootstrapping Juju machine agent\nStarting Juju machine agent (juju-agent-danialbehzadi-local)\n\nBut the machine log has an error about Module msr not found and no kvm containers possible: http://paste.ubuntu.com/9505262/\nHow ever the juju status is:\nenvironment: local\nmachines:\n  \"0\":\n    agent-state: started\n    agent-version: 1.20.14.1\n    dns-name: localhost\n    instance-id: localhost\n    series: trusty\n    state-server-member-status: has-vote\nservices: {}\n\nIf I type for example:\n\njuju deploy wordpress\n\nthe juju status would change to:\nenvironment: local\nmachines:\n  \"0\":\n    agent-state: started\n    agent-version: 1.20.14.1\n    dns-name: localhost\n    instance-id: localhost\n    series: trusty\n    state-server-member-status: has-vote\n  \"1\":\n    agent-state-info: 'error executing \"lxc-create\": lxc: call to cgmanager_move_pid_abs_sync(freezer)\n    failed: invalid request; Container already exists'\n    instance-id: pending\n    series: trusty\nservices:\n  wordpress:\n    charm: cs:trusty/wordpress-1\n    exposed: false\n    relations:\n      loadbalancer:\n      - wordpress\n    units:\n      wordpress/0:\n        agent-state: pending\n        machine: \"1\"\n\n\nA: OpenVZ is not a real VPS, but an advanced container. This has the advantages that it's cheap because you don't have the virtualisation overhead. However, it also means that what you can do with it is limited.\nThis limitation prevents you from creating LXC containers. Specifically in this case, one of the problems is that the msr kernel module is not loaded, and you do not have permissions to load it. \nThis is quite normal on a container-based virtual server, because the kernel is shared among all the virtual servers. Being able to change the kernel would be a very big security risk...\n", "Q: Number of Cores v. Processor Speed The short question: is Ubuntu/Lubuntu designed to run/utilize multi  (2+) core CPUs or is CPU speed the better approach for running these distros?\nI am designing a new PC and specing the CPU. I have read that some current software is not designed to take advantage of multicore processors. I began to wonder if this may apply to the OS also. Lubuntu/Ubuntu is my OS of choice for this new box. From a speed aspect, I am leaning towards Lubuntu as it is less \"intensive\".\nNow, the bigger question: I am not a gamer. I surf the web, having 3-6 webpages open at once. I also may have Open Office running and frequently download .PDF files and may open them. Thunderbird will be running, pinging every minute. I stream music during all this other activity.\nShould I focus on the fastest processor speed I can afford or look to a processor with the most cores?\n.\n\nA: Yes, Ubuntu can use multiple cores, and it does it pretty well. In fact, most supercomputers run Linux, and they have tons of processors.\nEven though this is true, it also depends upon the software to make appropriate use of multiple cores. Not all software can do multi threading, in this case, such software would use only one core.\nTo answer your question, most of the software you will use are not CPU intensive, so they would either not support multi threading or they will never use it. Hence you are better off using faster processor than one with multiple cores. Still, you might want at least dual core, just in case you need it.\n", "Q: How to update MySQL Server, MySQL Client and phpMyAdmin to the latest stable versions on my local machine running on 64-bit Ubuntu 12.04 LTS?

It happened 4 times today. I am using the computer, and then it turns off. Could anyone help me?\n\nA: The more probable reason is the overheat of processor. So after the next turn off, just go to BIOS, and check temperature sensors. So after the next load of the linux check temperature of LM sensors with:\nsensors-detect\nsystemctl enable lm_sensors.service\nsensors\n\nOr use psensor GUI software. Also read the article on how to setup and check the temperature of the system devices.\n\nA: Maybe it is overheating? \nYou can install the program \"sensors\" from the terminal (type in sensors and it will tell you how) and check the core temperature whenever you want by typing in sensors\n(\"turning off\" suggests that it is shutting itself down and not just cutting out suddenly (as if the power went), which is why I am thinking overheating.. )\n", "Q: Install VirtualBox on ubuntu 14.04 I downloaded virtualbox from Here.\nAnd i tried to install it by running the following command \nsudo dpkg -i virtualbox-4.3_4.3.20-96996~Ubuntu~raring_i386.deb\n\nAnd error occured in installation as :\nSelecting previously unselected package virtualbox-4.3.\n(Reading database ... 345499 files and directories currently installed.)\nPreparing to unpack virtualbox-4.3_4.3.20-96996~Ubuntu~raring_i386.deb ...\nUnpacking virtualbox-4.3 (4.3.20-96996~Ubuntu~raring) ...\ndpkg: dependency problems prevent configuration of virtualbox-4.3:\n virtualbox-4.3 depends on psmisc.\n\ndpkg: error processing package virtualbox-4.3 (--install):\n dependency problems - leaving unconfigured\nProcessing triggers for ureadahead (0.100.0-16) ...\nProcessing triggers for hicolor-icon-theme (0.13-1) ...\nProcessing triggers for shared-mime-info (1.2-0ubuntu3) ...\nProcessing triggers for bamfdaemon (0.5.1+14.04.20140409-0ubuntu1) ...\nRebuilding /usr/share/applications/bamf-2.index...\nProcessing triggers for gnome-menus (3.10.1-0ubuntu2) ...\nProcessing triggers for desktop-file-utils (0.22-1ubuntu1) ...\nProcessing triggers for mime-support (3.54ubuntu1) ...\nErrors were encountered while processing:\n virtualbox-4.3\n\nHow to fix it ?\n\nA: dpkg does not manage dependencies.\nSo now\nsudo apt-get install -f\n\nthen install again\nsudo dpkg -i virtualbox-4.3_4.3.20-96996~Ubuntu~raring_i386.deb\n\nOtherwise, I completely agree with the suggestion to use KVM (virt-manager) rather then virtualbox and if you must use virtualbox, install it from the repositories.\nSee: http://virt-manager.org/\nThe advantage of virt-manager is that it is open source and in does not require 3rd party code. Although virtualbox is in the repositories, not all the features available for virtualbox are open source.\n\nA: I would advise that unless there is some particular reason you use that particular type of virtual machine manager, that you instead open the \"Ubuntu Software Center\" and select its own \"Virtual Machine Manager\" which automatically accommodates all of the dependencies without any necessity for pre-installing anything or, asking advice of others on this site, for that matter.\nAt least, it seems worth a shot.  Installing \"Virtual Machine Manager\" is exactly what I did almost a year ago and I haven't stopped bragging about the results yet.  I carry with me an external USB drive to which I am running virtual machine under Ubuntu with five separate and differently configured windows installations, and I don't describe myself as remotely expert in this area.\nPlease just try doing it the EASY WAY first, and only resume the hard way if or when you discover an unacceptable limitation.\n\nA: As you can see in logs:\n\nvirtualbox-4.3 depends on psmisc.\n\nYou have missing psmisc package, just install it, something like follows:\nsudo apt-get install psmisc\n\n\nA: I would recommend installing from repository by: \n sudo apt-get install virtualbox\n\n", "Q: .desktop shortcut fails to launch program I have .desktop file on my desktop that serves as a launcher for my application.

Finally I've written the most simpler singal handler application for testing reason.\nHere is the code\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <string.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n#include <time.h> // DateTime kezeles\n#include <fcntl.h> // Rendszerhivasok file\n#include <unistd.h> // fork\n#include <sys/types.h> // pid_t típus\n#include <sys/wait.h> // wait, waitpid\n#include <sys/ipc.h>\n#include <sys/msg.h>\n#include <sys/time.h>\n\nvoid HandlerParent(int signalNumber){\n    printf(\"Parent received signal: %d\\n\", signalNumber);\n}\n\nint main (void)\n{\n    signal(SIGUSR1, HandlerParent);\n    signal(SIGUSR2, HandlerParent);\n\n    kill(getpid(), SIGUSR1);\n    sleep(3);\n    return 0;\n}\n\nSo again, this is not the project code.

I don't know if this can be caused by an installed application, or library.

So I need to use my PC instead of the server. I use Geany for development.\nPlease raise your question, or concern in the comments, and I try to answer it as soon as possible.\nThanks a lot in advance!\n\nA: You're suffering from this bug in GDM. The Debian package 3.12.2-4 has a fix. Looking at the GDM changelog for Ubuntu 14.04, it doesn't look like the fix was backported to 14.04, nor can I find a Launchpad bug report. So either:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use another signal (only SIGUSR1 was affected), or\n\n*Use another Display Manager (such as lightdm), or\n\n*Upgrade GDM (perhaps using the GNOME3 PPAs), or\n\n*Work in a TTY (CtrlAltF1 (or F2 to F6), or\n\n*Explicitly unblock SIGUSR1, or\n\n*File a bug (ubuntu-bug gdm), and hope that the fix gets backported.\n\n\nI'd advise you to do (1) and (6) for now.\nAt any rate, do (5) for any signal that you use.\n", "Q: Why is `service networking restart` not working in 14.04? I know that there are related questions with people asking, having trouble restarting their network in 14.04. However I would like to know if anyone has a more direct answer as to why we can't restart the networking services using the service command.\nOr why service networking restart has now been replaced with the manual ifdown/ifup command? \nEx.\nifdown eth0 && ifup eth0\n\nA: networking is simply not meant to be restarted or stopped on Ubuntu. The functionality simply isn't supported (and can't be supported as Jorge Castro notes). There are a lot of other services which depend on it.  The ifup/ifdown command didn't replace service networking restart, since it has always been available. Bryan Gonzalez does a good job of explaining it:\n\nUpstart is meant to be a complete replacement for Sysvinit. In the interest of backwards compatibility, the Upstart devs made some allowances so that people/packages still using sysvinit-style init scripts could continue to do so. The /etc/init.d/networking init script is written for sysvinit in such a way that calling it uses sysvinit methods and breaks dbus which is written for Upstart.\nThe solution here is to have the maintainer of the networking init script fix/rewrite it so that it is Upstart compatible. This may mean that the networking init script will lose compatibility with sysvinit, but they need to get over it. Sysvinit is deprecated/obsolete and too much effort is being wasted into maintaining it when the future is Upstart.\n\nAnd later on: \n\nThe problem is that we have a method to perform this task that is tried and tested for many years. \n\nAnd then:\n\nThis was a left-over deprecated functionality that though 'everyone knows no to use it' will cause damage if used. As you eloquently put it, this functionality no longer has any practical use, therefore it needed to be pruned.\n\nThere was a major bug which simply caused most of the GUI stack to go down, which has since been fixed.\nTo summarize:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you're on a GUI, then you simple have no business touching networking, since network-manager handles the interfaces once they have been brought up. (And even then you don't need to restart it.)\n\n*If you're on CLI, the ifup/ifdown commands already provided the functionality.\n\n", "Q: Synaptic stopped responding When troubleshooting no-response for Synaptic,in the \"Edit Launcher\" window command-line says \"/usr/bin/synaptic-pkexec\" but file manager shows \"X11\" where pkexec should be.\nTrying to open this X11 directory returns endless X11 directory icons, but no-way to open this directory...\nIs this malware, a bug,or something-else?\nHave already removed and reinstalled synaptic with same results. \n\nA: /usr/bin/X11 is a symlink pointing to /usr/bin/. So if you open /usr/bin/X11 you actually open /usr/bin/, and that still contains the symlink X11 pointing to /usr/bin/ ... \nThis symlink is used as the folder /usr/bin/X11 isn't really used any more by Ubuntu and all the files it used to contain are really in /usr/bin/ now. Thanks to the symlink they are still found in their old place if a program or user is expecting them there.\nThe file /usr/bin/synaptic-pkexec is part of the package synaptic so it should be there if Synaptic is installed. As there are a lot of files in /usr/bin/ it may take some time for the file manager to show them all. \nOn the command line you can use\nls -l /usr/bin/synaptic-pkexec\n\nto check if the file /usr/bin/synaptic-pkexec is there. The output should be something like\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 43 Jan 30  2012 /usr/bin/synaptic-pkexec\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.10 freeze at boot. After upgrade intel graphics (xorg-xserver etc) For the last week I fully reinstall Ubuntu about 4 times. I fed up of this - so I cry for help!\nWhatever I tried nothing work: purge and reinstall ubuntu-desktop, nvidia-drivers, xorg-xserver and so and so on.\nPlease, see the screenshot for more information at the moment when Ubuntu freeze (while booting)\n\nThe last actions were to add ppa:xorg-edges and install the latest packages, but unfortunately it doesn't help - result the same as before - black screen. However for now messages appear immediately after freezing.\nUPDATE: I don't know how to solve it and the answer is proposed I accepted only because there is no workaround ways.\n\nA: The xorg-edgers are known for potentially breaking systems.  You will need to boot into one of the recover modes (the one with networking available) and remove that package:\nsudo apt-get install ppa-purge\nsudo ppa-purge xorg-edgers\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\n\nTo get into the recovery mode, hold the left shift key down at boot time so that you see the Grub menu - choose the recovery option, and choose a terminal with network capability.  This does take a short while to load and become operational.\n", "Q: Unformat a drive? So I was in the process of creating a ubuntu live USB with the start up disc creator on my Ubuntu 14.04 computer.  I meant to format the USB stick that was in my computer but accidentally selected my 256GB External Hard Drive that used to contain every single thing I have ever done on a computer since middle school. 12 years of data gone.\nI immediately ejected the drive and have not touched it since.  I know that when you delete a file that generally it does not actually get deleted but is made available to be over ridden.\nIs it possible for me to unformat my drive?\n\nA: Yes, you should be able to retrieve the filesystem as long as you don't continue to write to it. The more stuff you write, the less chance you have of getting your filesystem back, because you'll start overwriting stuff. \nYou can use the Testdisk software do do these things, but if you've never done it before, you might possibly want to make a backup of your disk before doing so, just to make sure you don't make it worse. \nThe thing to keep in mind here is to keep calm, don't give up and read the manuals properly. There's very good chances you'll be able to retrieve everything perfectly if you take proper care. Also, if the filesystem turns out to be too damaged to retrieve, you should be able to get all your files back although this might be quite a lot of work. (Without the filesystem, you don't have filenames or directories, but only the file content). \n\nA: I had a HDD fail on me a few months back and my advice is to clone the drive to back it up before you start with recovery tools, rather than just copying it.  Copying will only copy files that are visible and indexed by the file system, whereas cloning will literally copy every sector of data on the drive, including lost/deleted files and 'junk'.  I believe there are free/open-source cloning tools available - do a Google search for 'Hiren's Boot Disk', I think that includes one or two.\n", "Q: RAM not fully usable in 64-bit Ubuntu GNU/Linux Greetings Ubuntu Community,\nI have 4 GB of DDR2 RAM and an x86_64 CPU and Ubuntu OS. When I am in Ubuntu I notice from the details section in settings that I have 3.86 GB of RAM when I am sure that I have 4 GB of RAM. I also checked this from the BIOS and it says that the capacity and usable size is 4096 MB (4 GB). Can anyone please provide me with a reason and a solution to this?\nThanks & Regards\nIsaac Cilia Attard\n\nA: This is your on-board video card stealing your main RAM as it has no VRAM of itself.\n2 possibilities to solve this issue:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disable the on-board video not the GPU in your BIOS.  \n\n\n*\n\n*On newer BIOSes, disable 'Hybrid' mode and set it to discrete GPU only (NVidia in your particular case)\n\n*On older BIOSes, you can choose how much RAM to allocate to the on-board video, with 0 disabling it)\n\n\n*Disable through hardware switch. (Not for the faint at heart)\nDownload your computer's Service Manual, disassemble your PC, disable the video hardware switch.\n", "Q: Preview for Unity/Nautilus I am using Ubuntu 14.10 with Unity.\nI would like to have a Preview utility, like on a Mac.

Always wondered, finally decided to give it a go. I downloaded and installed Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS (most current on the site), which installed with no hiccups. Overwrote my Windows 7, since this is an extra computer just taking up space. After install it boots to a black screen with a flashing cursor/underscore. No response no matter what I do.\nInstalled on an old hp a1430n with a nVidia GeForce 6150LE graphics chip in it. Did some research and many people said there are initial issues with nVidia. Cool, I can read and follow instructions.\nSaid to try to use the install CD to \"Try Ubuntu\" and write some lines in a terminal. Try that, Linux comes up and then freezes when I touch anything. Has happened every time I tried, which is at least 8.\nSaid to open up a GRUB menu and do some things in there. Said to press/hold shift when booting. Tried every way they mentioned, no success. No GRUB menu.\nTried a reinstall, or 3, with different options chosen. No luck there. Messed with BIOS options. Did nothing.\n So I have a PC with an operating system on it. No way to get to a menu to install or uninstall drivers or programs. Should I try a different version of Ubuntu, or a different Linux variant? Any help would be greatly appreciated.

I don't understand why it worked, but for over a year it was the only way I could use my old laptop.\n\nA: I had the exact same issue, as seen in this post\nBut here's what I did to solve it; short form:\n-Check the CD with Checksum and Check Disk on the installer menu, accessed by pressing SPACE when you get to the screen with the person and the keyboard on the bottom (Accessibility Screen).\nAlso, as suggested by forum user grahmmechanical:\nafter accessing the screen with the purple guy, instead of checking the disk from there, scroll and find Try-Ubuntu/Install Ubuntu. When you get here, do not hit enter, but instead press F6. You will be greeted with a boot options menu, select nomodeset and hit return.
