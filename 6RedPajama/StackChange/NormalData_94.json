Integration with system settings and preferences is critical to the sense of an application “belonging” on the system. It affects the ability to manage that application using the same tools one uses to manage all the other applications, and the sorts of settings-and-preference experience that users can have with the app. This has traditionally been a problem with Qt / KDE applications on Ubuntu, because Gtk apps all use a centrally-manageable preferences store, and KDE apps do things differently.\"  \n\nAnd is trying to fix it:  \n\n\"To address this, Canonical is driving the development of dconf bindings for Qt, so that it is possible to write a Qt app that uses the same settings framework as everything else in Ubuntu. We’ve contracted with Ryan Lortie, who obviously knows dconf very well, and he’ll work with some folks at Canonical who have been using Qt for custom development work for customers. We’re confident the result will be natural for Qt developers, and a complete expression of dconf’s semantics and style.\"\n\n\nA: The reason for this kind of thing is the desktop environment. When developers make an environment, they want it to look just right for them. This means that applications would be programmed differently for different environments. Currently, most of the apps are made for either gnome, or KDE. The gnome ones default to one theme, the KDE ones default to another. If the program does not recognize that it is in a different environment, or the different environment does not adapt to the program, there will be design flaws. With Gnome, all applications default to either the Redmond theme or the Raleigh theme.  In KDE, it will fall back to whatever it can find. If the program has dependencies in it that involve the Plasma Workspace, then it will probably incorporate the Oxygen widget theme. Otherwise, it will look much like you just installed Wine and are running a simple windowed app from there.\n\nA: As far as I know (and understand), this happens because KDE apps are by default designed to be installed in a Kubuntu environment. For this reason, they are of course packaged to use a QT (thus KDE) theme by default, as opposed to the QT-GTK+ theme.\nMaybe in the future, the application will be able to detect which environment it is running on at the time and automatically choose a theme to suit.\n", "Q: Recovering data from a faulty disk When I plug in a removable 1TB USB disk in my laptop, the operations led keeps blinking for a while and then you can hear the servo mechanism resetting with a short \"tack\".\nI'd like to recover the data.  \nI believe there might be some way to get the data through low level IOs.  \nWhat I believe is that the mounting process assumes the disk is OK and I should prevent this before using ddrescue or something similar.\nDoes anybody have a solution to this problem?\n\nA: The information on the following page was very helpful when I had a failing disk recently:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/DataRecovery\nIn short, you will need enough space to store an image of the entire file system and then make a copy with ddrescue.  This program will continue reading from the disk in the presence of errors, and retry failed reads.\nOnce you've got an image of the file system, you can then use other tools to recover your files without them failing due to read errors.\n\nA: If (as it seems), you're dealing with a mechanic hardware problem (not with lost or corrupted data in your HDD), it is going to be difficult to recover your data.\nI'd suggest you plugged your drive to a SATA port, instead of using the USB interface (i.e., extract the HDD from its enclosure and plug it to an internal SATA port, probably in another computer, as you are talking about a laptop... find a desktop pc to do this).\nIf you can't manage to backup your data because the drive keeps failing, you could also try this solution, which initially sounds weird but somehow makes sense. With your -literally- frozen HDD you can try to directly copy your data or, if that fails, move up to ddrescue.\nP.S. With the HDD attached to your SATA port you will be able to see its SMART status (with Disk Utility).\n", "Q: Does not install to hard drive on an MSI Wind I'm running Ubuntu from a pendrive.\nWhen install to hard drive is selected from the first screen after booting from the pendrive the process stops before the partitioning drive page appears.\nI have a MSI WIND with recently restored Windows xp.\n\nA: Try the alternative CD installer.\nMore than likely it will work where the live CD/USB does not.\n", "Q: How do I set up Android ADB?

No setup is necessary.\nSimply download the official SDK Platform-Tools for Linux from Google and extract adb and fastboot from the zip file.\n\nA: I'm only guessing but perhaps you need to make sure Ubuntu is looking in the right place. As it says on the website, make sure you have added the directory that adb is located to your $PATH by adding export PATH=${PATH}:/usr/local/src/android-sdk-linux_x86/tools & export PATH=${PATH}:/usr/local/src/android-sdk-linux_x86/platform-tools to your .bashrc and running source .bashrc\n\nA: Install adb & fastboot via PPA\nYou can install from the WebUpd8 PPA which support both 32-bit and 64-bit.

You invoked make in this case, and it tried to invoke sphinx-build, but failed when it couldn't find it.\nauto-apt run [...] will run the command specified, then guide you through installing packages containing missing files that it knows apt-get can find and install.\nSo, just invoke auto-apt run make html and see what happens :)\nFor more information, see the the documentation for auto-apt\n", "Q: Recovering from messed up binfmts configuration All I'm trying to do is getting a manually installed mono (to /opt/mono-2.10) to run CLI executables without having to specify the interpreter explicitly. Wine is not installed.\nUbuntu 10.10. No mono package is currently installed (dpkg -l | grep mono gives nothing), but they were in the past before I realized that I need a much newer one, so that's probably the source of this mess.\nRunning a CLI executable gives me this:\nCan't exec \"/usr/lib/cli/binfmt-detector-cli\": No such file or directory at /usr/share/binfmt-support/run-detectors line 92.\n\nThat is correct, /usr/lib/cli/binfmt-detector-cli does not exist and I don't know where it should have come from.\nSo I googled a bit and found some information about the binfmt_misc module. Indeed, it is loaded and I have a /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/cli which contains this:\nenabled\ninterpreter /usr/share/binfmt-support/run-detectors\nflags:\noffset 0\nmagic 4d5a\n\nThis run-detectors script is Perl, but apparently doesn't work (this is probably Debian #575776):\nuser@host:/$ /usr/share/binfmt-support/run-detectors\nUse of uninitialized value in open at /usr/share/binfmt-support/run-detectors line 56.\nUse of uninitialized value $ARGV[0] in concatenation (.) or string at /usr/share/binfmt-support/run-detectors line 56.\nrun-detectors: unable to open : No such file or directory\n\nBut anyway, I don't have Wine, so I don't need all that binfmt-detector-cli stuff in the first place. I just want those binaries to be hard linked with the Mono interpreter. I found this answer on SU and this blog entry, which discuss how to change these rules. Unfortunately, trying that, I always get a 'permission denied':\nuser@host:/$ sudo echo .:CLR:M::MZ::/opt/mono-2.10/bin/mono:. > /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/register\nbash: /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/register: Permission denied\nuser@host:/$ sudo echo -1 > /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/cli\nbash: /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/cli: Permission denied\n\nI found /usr/share/binfmts/cli and changed it to\npackage mono-runtime\ninterpreter /opt/mono-2.10/bin/mono\nmagic MZ\n\nbut that seems to have no effect. Then there is /var/lib/binfmts/cli, which I changed to\nmono-runtime\nmagic\n0\nMZ\n\n/opt/mono-2.10/bin/mono\n\nbut that also has no effect. I also found the script update-binfmts but I can't get it to work. I don't even manage to remove an existing configuration. The following attempt for example leaves me with a rather cryptic error message:\nuser@host:/$ sudo update-binfmts --remove cli /opt/mono-2.10/bin/mono\nupdate-binfmts: warning: current package is <local>, but binary format already\ninstalled by mono-runtime ; not removing.\n\nI have no idea whether my arguments were valid (the help page mentions <path> but doesn't say the path to what it wants... or why), whether the second line is supposed to be an error message and whether it changed anything in the first place.\nHow do I make any executable that starts with the magic string 'MZ' to be run with /opt/mono-2.10/bin/mono?\n\nUpdate 1: The outputs to the commands Colin suggested:\nuser@host:/$ sudo update-binfmts --package mono-runtime --remove cli /opt/mono-2.10/bin/mono\nupdate-binfmts: warning: current package is mono-runtime, but binary format\nalready installed by mono-runtime ; not removing.\nuser@host:/$ dpkg -S /usr/share/binfmts/cli\ndpkg: /usr/share/binfmts/cli not found.\nuser@host:/$ sudo rm /usr/share/binfmts/cli*\nuser@host:/$ sudo update-binfmts --install cli /opt/mono-2.10/bin/mono --magic MZ\nupdate-binfmts: warning: current package is <local>, but binary format already\ninstalled by mono-runtime\nupdate-binfmts: exiting due to previous errors\n\n\nA: You should never edit /var/lib/binfmts/cli by hand.  That's a state file for update-binfmts.  You may have confused it by doing so, although I suspect the mono packages were buggy in the first place to have left things in this condition.  Plus, there's a trailing space confusing matters.\nI'd recommend clearing out state first:\nupdate-binfmts --package 'mono-runtime ' --remove cli /opt/mono-2.10/bin/mono\nThen check whether /usr/share/binfmts/cli is owned by any package (dpkg -S /usr/share/binfmts/cli - I don't think it should be, as you don't have mono-runtime installed), and if not then remove that file.\nThen install the binary format properly, as a locally-installed format rather than one owned by a package:\nupdate-binfmts --install cli /opt/mono-2.10/bin/mono --magic MZ\n", "Q: Wget server issues or the command is wrong?

This happens in FF and Chrome and this is only happens with Samba mounts. As a matter of fact, NFS volumes that are located on the same network operate perfectly fine.\n\nA: To mount samba shares in our home directory we may use SMBNetFS.

Which would be the first that I would ask you to perform in order to add further information that can help you to find a solution.\nIf you can't do what you wish with a local file (let's say in your desktop), then this is not a network based issue but probably your browser is finding a limitation, which may include but not limits only to the FireWall. Try then disabling firewall and achieve this task both in your local and remote files.\nYou can disable firewall by using a GUI like Firestarter. Which may be in the default repositories inside of Synaptic.\nLet's wait for your answer in order to change/delete this.\n\nA: I could workaround an issue like this by selecting the file at the folder ~/.gvfs instead of the folder showed as a network folder.  \nps. ~/.gvfs is where Nautilus mount the samba share.\n\nA: You could check if it's a file permission issue.\nFirst, open a terminal and run the following commands:\ncd ~/.gvfs\nls -la\n\nIf you see that the samba mountpoints don't have global execute -permissions (e.g. like this: drwx--x--- ), then you can try adding permissions to the share with the command:\nchmod 777 sharefolder\n\nthis command will give all user accounts on your computer read+write+transfer permissions to the mount folder in question. If your browser has been using a different user account than yours, it may solve the issue.\n\nA: Instead you can just drag and drop the file and it attaches fine. This works for attaching files in Thunderbird from a network drive.\n\nA: Well I hate to reopen an old thread buuut I found this and after scouring the interweb some more, I thought I might let any future viewers know:\nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/MountWindowsSharesPermanently\nThat worked 100% for me, I can now access windows shares system wide, including from the file upload dialog in my browser.

What would be the ideal way of transferring the data in a reasonably fast speed compared to sftp?\n\nA: I've found that rsync is pretty fast. You can set up NFS or SAMBA on both machines and rsync everything over.\nIf NFS and SAMBA aren't your thing skip the encryption and install vsftpd on the target machine and FTP away. vsftpd is very fast.\n\nA: Is this a one time action or something you'll be doing ongoing?  \nTransferring lots of small files tends to be inefficient, so it would help if you could tar them up prior to transfer.  Also, if your network link is secure (e.g. it's wired with only trusted systems on it), you can gain speed by just doing bare FTP.\nIf you have lots of data that you need to keep regularly in sync that only partially updates, rsync is optimized for this case.\n\nA: for larger file transfers i use rsync as that is very handy if something happens on the network, or one of users says - hell, i am going to reboot.\nIf transfer security is required, use rsync with ssh. searching for rsync over ssh should yield usable how-tos with explanations.\nOther easy way is to install sshd (opensshd-server) and use sftp for transfers (along with scp)\n\nA: Take out the disk and walk it over.\nEven if you need to \"transfer\", still take out the disk and walk it over for SATA/eSATA transfer.

Most of the machines are placed in places that are really hard to get to.\nI have a central machine from which I can freely ssh to all other machines. this central machine is the only one that is connected to the internet.\nI now have a need to install Java 1.6 on all the 'remote' machines (those that are not connected to the internet). \nWould it be possible to do so by accessing them from within the 'central' machine, and providing them with the Java 1.6 installation files (or in some other way?) how do I go about it?\n\nA: download zip\nYou can always downsload an archived JDK from oracle. This can be moved to an appropriate position, and extracted there. \nJava doesn't need much setup. Setting JAVA_HOME in in a profile file is a good idea, and putting the JDK/bin - dir into the path. However ... \n\n\n*\n\n*If there is already an OpenJDK installed, or Java-1.5, it can be more complicated. There are often a lot of links in /etc/alternatives for Java - check that out. \n\n\ncentral machine as repository\nI don't know if it is possible to use the central pc as a proxy. to install the JDK there, and tell the other machines to use it as source. Keywords for a search: repository, apt-get, proxy.\nsuboption/variant:\nCopy the so downloaded .dep-files to the clients, and use dpkg -i xy.deb to install it. \nNetwork vodoo\nYou can use a few commands, put into a script, to use the central machine as router, to visit the internet from the clients. You need 2 commands on the clients too. Then you could use apt-get from the clients to access the internet. \nI don't understand these scripts myself - only in sofar, to adopt it to my needs. :) This is my 'gateway.sh' script, to be run on the router with sudo:\n#!/bin/bash\n# test if ip-forward is up - if not, enable it:\n#\n# maybe the network card has no IPv4 adress? Use a static IP:\n# if you have a static, well known IP, comment this out:\nifconfig eth0 192.168.32.8 up \n#\n# Tell the kernel to do ip-forwarding:\n#\nipf=$(cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward)\nif [[ ipf -eq \"0\" ]] ; then \n    echo \"1\" > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward\nfi\n#\n# forward-masquerade, script follows:\n#\n. /etc/ppp/masquerade\n#\n# might or might not be needed. \n# start dhcp-server, older method:\n# /etc/init.d/dhcp3-server start\n# newer method:\n# /etc/init.d/dhcdbd start\n\nThen you need the ip-masquerade-script, which you needn't place in /etc/ppp/masqeuerade, but change the line in gateway.sh, if you don't do so.\niptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o ppp0 -j MASQUERADE\n#\nmodprobe ip_conntrack_ftp\nmodprobe ip_nat_ftp\n#\niptables -A FORWARD -p tcp --tcp-flags SYN,RST, SYN -j TCPMSS --clamp-mss-to-pmtu\n\nJust a few lines. Now you would start sudo gateway.sh and wait for the clients. These wouldn't do much: \n sudo route add default gw 192.168.32.8 \n\nwhatever the IP of the central machine is. This could already be sufficient. Maybe you would modify the DNS-Server, to have one of your ISPs DNS in there: \n sudo edit /etc/resolv.conf \n\nA running avahi-daemon and NetworkManager could interfere with the clients, mainly. \nconclusion:\nFor the third and first way, I know how to do it exactly, but the most elegant way would probably be No. 2, but I never did it myself. So I would recommend to search a bit, or wait a little, maybe somebody knows how to do it, or how to do something better.\n\nA: You could set up an apt proxy. If you search Synaptic for apt proxy, you'll find several options. In the past, I've used either apt-cacher or apt-cacher-ng; I can't remember which.\nThe apt proxy should enable your \"remote\" machines to use apt just as if they were connected to the Internet. And, you'll only use the bandwidth to download a particular package once.\n\nA: How about setting up the central machine up as an NFS server, and placing the JDK update files there- and mounting that directory on other machines on the intranet?\n", "Q: Where is \"Connect to Server\" for ssh connections in Unity?

Is there a way to make a launcher (icon) on Unity panel from Nautilus's bookmarks or it is for programs only?\nThanks\n\nA: I wrote a script to do that autmatically. See: \nWhat Custom Launchers and Unity Quicklists are available?\n\nHome Icon Quicklist (auto-update from bookmarks)\nHere is a small shell script that updates\n  your Home-Quicklist with all your\n  nautilus bookmarks. \n\n\n\nA: Seems to only be for Programs at this point, I've just made a custom launcher and set it to Location and entered the command so it would open up where I wanted it to, then I went into Terminal and did gksudo nautilus and then navigated my way to home/username/Desktop and copied the launcher to usr/share/applications.  Then I dragged the launcher to unity but it didn't stay.\nIf you'd like to place icons in Unity, say for example Wine programs that you've installed then I have the following instructions for you.\n1 - Right click your desktop\n2 - Select Create Launcher\n3 - Create the custom Launcher as you want to\nNow you got the launcher on the Desktop. If you are satisfied with it, get it in the Launcher Panel:\n4 - Open Nautilus as root. Press Alt + F2 and paste gksu nautilus\n5 - Browse to /home/your-username/Desktop\n6 - Copy the launcher by clicking right on it and select Copy\n7 - Browse to /usr/share/applications\n8 - Paste your launcher by clicking right on a blank space and select Paste\n9 - Now drag and drop your launcher from /usr/share/applications to the Launcher Bar on the left on your Screen\n10 - You can now delete your custom Launcher on the Desktop.\n\nA: If you press super(winkey)+f or click \"Files and folders\" on your launcher, then Favorite folders are Nautilus bookmarks.

IMO since both desktops ship with Natty and neither one of them is 100% bug-free, there ought to be an easy way to tell them apart. As it is, they can be distinguished by the slightly different appearance of the upper banner and lower banner. For example, in \"Ubuntu Classic\" the Ubuntu Button at upper-left corner of the screen is in larger and colored orange and yellow.\n\nA: You are running the old Gnome classic desktop, not Unity. They made it look somewhat like Unity, but the classic Gnome configuration has been updated to look more like it used too.\nTry logging out and manually select Unity as your session.

The menu definition is in src/file-manager/fm-desktop-icon-view.c inside desktop_view_entries[] (or just search for Change Desktop _Background). Edit2: See below for HowTo.\nOther option would be to use different file manager to draw desktop icons. Maybe PCMan File Manager doesn't have this entry in right-click menu?\nMinimal guide to editing & rebuilding Nautilus\nAs I've noted before, the menu entry is hardcoded to Nautilus, so as far as I know, the only way how to remove it AND keep all other functionality is to edit Nautilus' source and recompile it. Be warned that it will take some time and you'll need some space for all the development packages and compilation itself.\nThe process was tested with Nautilus Elementary 2.32.2.2, however there shouldn't be any differences for stock Nautilus 2.32.\n\n\n*\n\n*Get basic development packages: sudo apt-get install build-essential fakeroot dpkg-dev devscripts\n\n*Get development dependencies for Nautilus sudo apt-get build-dep nautilus\n\n*Download Nautilus source - note that this command doesn't require sudo; also, it'll place multiple files to current directory so it's usually good idea to create an extra dir for that. mkdir nautilus\ncd nautilus\napt-get source nautilus\n\n*The source will be downloaded and extracted to nautilus-VERSION* folder (VERSION is, of course some version number, most probably 2.32.something). Get into that folder.\n\n*Open file src/file-manager/fm-desktop-icon-view.c\n\n*Search for GtkActionEntry desktop_view_entries[] - in my case it's on line 721 however it may differ for your version.

I like Unity interface very much. However, I was thinking to try out Gnome3 as well. But, wanted to be careful. I've already setup unity and I don't want to mess up. Is installing gnome3 will affect Unity desktop by chance ?. \n\nA: From my experience, I was able to add the PPA, install and use GNOME 3, and then remove it effortlessly, without breaking my Unity setup. \nI added the GNOME 3 PPA, installed all the required packages and libs, logged out and tried GNOME 3. Then I used this little neat utility called ppapurge (in the repos) to remove and revert all packages from the GNOME 3 PPA. It worked wonderfully. Just to reallly check it, I did a quick scan through Synaptic of all packages in the PPA, and none was installed. \nIt worked not only for me, but for others too. However, if you really praise your Unity setup, it's probably better not to touch anything. And anyway, the current GNOME3 experience in Ubuntu Natty is way below of what it should be, and I recommend you to try it using one of the live images made available on gnome3.org.\n\nA: Gnome 3 will break your unity installation.\nThere is still no possibility to get them both in one ubuntu-installation.\n", "Q: Daily (open source) Bible devotional guide software Are there any apps for my daily devotions? \n\nA: Try Xiphos  or gnome-sword  (this is for older installations) for a complete solution, including the option to install daily devotionals (though nothing beats reading the Bible as the Spirit leads in a free way ;)).\nP.S. they are the same program, but Xiphos is the renamed newer version.\nThere is also bibletime  if you use QT/KDE or just want variety.\nIf you want to install extra Bible translations, Bible maps, and devotions, then add the crosswire.org sources within the program, and download as many as you want ;).\nHope that helps ^^!\n\nA: Open Synaptic System → Administration  → Synaptic Package Manager or the Software Center and search for \"bible\". There are quite a few bible programs to find there.\nIt seams like verse is the only dispositional. To install it either search for it in one of the above or just run this in a terminal:\nsudo apt-get install verse\n\n", "Q: How to copy files to multiple hosts across the network? I have more than 200 Ubuntu systems to which I want to copy a file.\nHow can I copy files to multiple hosts across the network? What possibilities do I have?\nNote: This question is related to How to find the version of an Ubuntu machine remotely?\n\nA: I realise you probably only want something simple but there are dozens of ways of doing this. But first we want to be able to control all the computers at once.\nThat might seem a strange direction to go but it'll save you time later on when you might want to send a shutdown, reboot, upgrade to all the computers.\nclusterssh\nLet's install clusterssh and fire off a command to connect to all our servers at once (this might not be viable for 200 at once - I don't have 200 computers to test it on!)\nsudo apt-get install clusterssh\ncssh user@first_computer:port user@second_computer:port ...\n\nThat will spawn little output windows for each connection (why I say 200 might be a stretch) and one global input dialogue. From there you can send the same command to all your servers.\nIf you want to do it from the command line, and this might support 200 connections, you can look at the -a flag for cssh. You can throw each server a command (or string of commands). It'll connect, execute and close the connection.\ncssh -a 'cd directory; ls'  user@first_computer:port user@second_computer:port \n\nYou can simplify your connections by using clusterssh's powerful configuration. Open man cssh and head down to the FILES section. It explains how you can create an /etc/clusters file to allow you to quickly create groups (called tags) like this:\nclusters = <tag1> <tag2> <tag3>\n<tag1> = host1 host2 host3\n<tag2> = user@host4 user@host5 host6\n<tag3> = <tag1> <tag2>\n\nThen you can do:\ncssh -T 'tag2' -a 'cd directory; ls'\n\nUse a central repository\nI don't mean a deb repo (but that's possible too, I guess) rather something like git or brz. It could be something as simple as a web server or a network share. If network bandwidth has bottlenecks in places, something like a torrent server might even be the best course (that's how Facebook updates all their nodes)\nTell your network to download the files\nFrom here it's just connecting the dots. Using cssh you'd just tell all your computers to fetch the file and do whatever needs doing with it.\nI suggest you start small. Get the file shared and then try a simple cluster of a couple of computer and see how it goes. Expand that out.\nI suggest that even once you're done you keep a cluster of a couple of computers for testing before you push things to the main group.\n\nA: Alternatively you can keep it push-based. The easiest way of that is writing a script that:\n\n\n*\n\n*Iterates through a list of servers\n\n*Connects to the server and copies the files (two options here):\n\n\n*\n\n*Uses sshfs to mount the remote filesystem locally, cp/rsync the files, fusermount -u the directory you mounted it on (to unmount the remote system).  Continue.\n\n*Just use rsync's network abilities to copy the files over.\nrsync /localdir/ user@remote:/remotedir\n\n\nA: [Oli's answer came on while I was typing] \nAn alternative to clusterss is parallel-scp. It is part of the pssh package\nYou need to provide the list of hosts in a text file (e.g. hosts.txt) and then you issue:\nparallel-scp -h hosts.txt file2copy.dat /target/directory\nConsult the man page to suite your particular needs. This shouldn't hit limits for too many connections since it doesn't require to open live connections to all as cssh does it will try this sequentially.\nPS: Having key-based authorization set up will of course make this a lot easier but I suspect having your key distributed to 200 systems in the 1st place might be why you're asking this question ...\n", "Q: Only a few internet pages will load Okay, I just installed Ubuntu 10.10 on my hp 2140.

Can anyone help?\n\nA: Try to change MTU in Network Manager. It works for me 2 years ago.\n", "Q: Will upgrading to 11.04 destroy my current desktop settings? I've had problems the last few upgrades. Things have been added to Ubuntu that I don't particularly care for. Window buttons have moved, Indicator Applets have sprung up, menu icons have vanished and each upgrade I've found myself having to \"fix\" things to get them back to how they were.\nI'm not going to get bogged down in whether my opinion is \"correct\" or otherwise, just that I'd like to stay the same.\nThe upgrade to 11.04 poses major issues for me where all of the following statements are true:\n\n\n*\n\n*I like new versions of packages\n\n*I'd like to be on the current version of Ubuntu to help people with that version\n\n*I'm too busy to spend hours recovering my panel-based desktop configuration\n\n*I have no desire to try Unity now. I may want to in the future, but not today, thank you.\n\n\nMy understanding is that the default upgrade would dump me in a Unity environment regardless of my previous desktop settings.\nI'm aware of the Classic mode. My understanding is it's currently a completely new configuration of panels made to look more like Unity. I realise I could battle it to the death to get my current theme/panel-settings/pannel-applets back, but unless it just defaults to my current desktop, I'm not very interested in it. I'd rather not upgrade.\nSo the question is: Can I upgrade to Natty without destroying my desktop? Is there a clean upgrade path for users (for example) who have hundreds of users they can't afford to retrain right now? Or are we stuck on Maverick for the foreseeable future?\nEdit: I guess to clarify a sub-questions would be: What does Classic Mode show when you do an upgrade? The old, previously configured desktop or a new stock configuration? I might have to test this in a VM to see what happens but it's a lot of bandwidth to spend on an experiment.\n\nEdit I upgraded today. Took me to Unity, I logged out and into Classic (as expected). Most of the settings appear in tact, Compiz has a whole load of new defaults and lost settings (fair enough), most of my panel applets (window lists, clock, notification area) aren't loading. There will be a follow up question.\n\nA: In short, probably not.\nForgetting the desktop, there were a handful of applications that I had installed on a Lucid -> Maverick box that were removed by Natty B1 installation because of missing dependencies. These weren't mainstream applications - most of which are maintained and thus version compatible with the Natty libraries, and none of them were critical to what I do so I don't remember which were removed.\nUnlike that other operating system, there isn't the overbearing market need to ensure that your copy of Lotus 1-2-3 from 10 years ago still runs on the new shiny.\nIf you've got hundreds of users, surely one of them won't miss their computer if you \"borrow\" it as a sacrifice machine. Failing that, carve off some disk, or get another disk (they are stunningly cheap these days) clone off your config and upgrade the copy to see how insufferable the damage is. It may also be useful in your environment to be able to dual boot Maverick/Natty as needed.\nAdded: You are asking for a guarantee that only empirical testing can afford you. Ubuntu is such a hypercomplex maze of interdependencies that given a huge static survey of your current installation, I'd be hard pressed to give you a definitive answer to what will change or break. If this wasn't so, you could just upgrade the packages you wanted. But you can't do that without entering dependency hell which the modern distros work so hard at avoiding.\n\nA: If I understand correctly \"Unity\" (3d) is a compiz plug-in and runs on top of gnome 2.3.\nIncluded in the the release will be \"Classic\" this again running on gnome 2.3 and having normal panels etc..\nThe thing you are confusing is Unity 2d this will not be included but will be available if required.\n\nA: Oli, I've decided to wait to see how things shake out. Perhaps you want to consider that. You can always create a VM of Natty (or 2, one with Unity, one without) as a means of helping other people out.\nI created a virtual machine of Natty beta and was pretty thrown by it UI wise. For grins I created a LiveCD of Gnome 3 and liked it much better. The experience of playing with Gnome 3, has told me to leave well enough alone for now.\nJust my 2 cents.\n", "Q: Show Time drift relative to a time Server I want to monitor the time drift on my workstation. How can I compare my local time to a timeserver like pool.ntp.org and show the difference?\n\nA: Old, Outdated Answer\nIf you run ntpdate -q pool.ntp.org, it will show you the difference between your time and the time server.\nstrong text\nntpdate has been deprecated for quite some time, and as of this edit (2017) it may no longer be available on new distributions.\nclockdiff _server_ will show the clock difference and has been available since 12.04 LTS.

On my desktop typing python- and pressing Tab offers suggestions of installable packages that are prefixed python. My server doesn't have this ability, how can I fix that?\n\nA: Install bash-completion and put this line in your ~/.bashrc (but check first if there is a similar line first):\n. /etc/bash_completion\n\nNote that it will only take effect in new terminals you open from now on. To take effect in the current terminal source your ~/.bashrc\nsource ~/.bashrc\n\nor \n. ~/.bashrc\n\n", "Q: What is the preferred way of transfering a filesystem between two local HDD's I want to migrate an external USB HDD which I have been running Ubuntu 10.04 LTS for a while onto a Laptop internal HDD.\nUnfortunately the internal HDD is smaller than the external HDD so I cannot transfer the partition using dd. But all the files on the external HDD will fit on the internal HDD so copying all files will work.\nAfter googling and reading this blog post and all its comments, it seems like rsync -H and cp -a are both good candidates, but I never really got a confirming answer which of those that was fastest, most reliable etc. rsync is good for other things as well but for a local filesystem transfer, cp would be the right choice, I mean this is Unix so the basic commands should work.\n\nA: Rsync is meant for regularly synchronizing two copies and efficiently transferring only the changed parts.  Since you only need to copy once, cp -a will work just fine, though you should get the same results with rsync.\nAfter copying, you will need to edit /etc/fstab on the internal disk and update the UUID of the disk.  You can look up your disks' UUIDs with:\nsudo blkid\n\nThen you will need to install grub on the internal disk.  Assuming that the internal disk is sda and you have it mounted in /mnt, do:\nsudo grub-install --root-directory=/mnt/ /dev/sda\n\nThat will make the new disk bootable.\n\nA: When doing a selective backup, make sure that you copy /var/cache/apt/archives to your new machine. This way, you do not need to re-download all packages.\n", "Q: how to rename directories that are hard to type?

For example, if you have only one directory with weird in the name:\nmv \"*weird*\" a-regular-named-directory\n\nwhere the \" are important. If this fails, you can use\nls --hide-control-chars\n\nThat will give you a listing with odd characters replaced by ?, which is then a shell pattern upon which you can use mv.\n\nA: You could just:\nmv firstCoupleLetters[tab] newDir[enter] \n\nand rely on autocomplete to fill out the original directory name, renaming it to something shorter/more useful.\n\nA: msw's answer using xargs is OK.\nHowever, I would do\n\n*\n\n*with find -exec instead of xargs.\n\n*using mv -t target sources... form instead of mv source target, so you don't need to call mv for each file.\n\nfind ~/Downloads -type f -name \"*.txt\" -exec mv -t \"/path/to/other_directory\" {} +\n\n\nAlternatively, you can use globstar:\nshopt -s globstar\nmv ~/Downloads/**/*.txt \"/path/to/other_directory\"\n\n# Unset globstar again if you don't need it anymore:\nshopt -u globstar\n\n", "Q: I s there an equivalent to the Netspeed Applet? I use the netspeed applet to monitor all my internet connections, in particular when using mobile broadband where it also gives a total of the transfers during the connection. \nI understand that there are no current plans to allow use of such indicator applets in Natty with Unity. Are there any work-rounds for running applets or are there equivalent applications which will run under Natty.  \n\nA: I'm using netspeed applet on Ubuntu 11.10 with Unity. The real fact is that even though using Unity I run the gnome-panel. I only have the bottom-panel with the window list and netspeed applet. So I'm using the global Unity menu-bar (the default with indicators,...) plus the old gnome-panel for bottom-panel, where I can continue using previous applets such as netspeed:\ni   netspeed                        - Traffic monitor applet for GNOME\ni   gnome-panel                     - launcher and docking facility for GNOME   \nI can't live without bottom-bar with window list.\nNOTICE: The way to open \"properties\" menú on gnome-panel --to add applets, configure panel, etc--  is a little tricky (at least in my case). I have to press ALT+Left_Mouse_Btn+Right_Mouse_Btn.\nNote: I configure gnome-panel as startup application in Unity to load it each time Unity starts.\nHope this helps!\nGerard.\n\nA: gnome-system-monitor is still present but like most panel applets no longer has a bit that lives in the indicator area and gives you a continual view of it's network in/out statistics.\nI've yet to puzzle out if this is an affirmative design choice (\"there shall be no status indicators unless you are banshee or evolution\") or if the applications just haven't caught up to the new mechanism.\n", "Q: Alt+tab out of fullscreen game Right now I'm running Trine, which is a game using OpenGL running in fullscreen, in Ubuntu 10.10. \nWhat I would like to be able to do is Alt+Tab out of the game to be able to browse the web, check any IM messages, etc. while paused. \nHowever, just Alt+Tab'ing doesn't do anything, so I have to quit the game every time I want to check something.\nIs there any way that I can minimize a fullscreen game? I know I can probably run it in windowed mode, but then I would have to hide the panels when playing - since the game would otherwise be hidden underneath. Plus, that's just an ugly solution.\n\nA: If you run it in windowed mode, you can set it to always on top and the same size as your desktop so the panels are not showing, but allows easy alt+tab. This is essentially borderless windowed mode.Try wmctrl. Something like:\n#!/bin/bash\ntrine &\n#resize to 1024x768 (or whatever size you want)\nwmctrl -r 'Trine' -e 1,0,0,1024,768\n#make it on top\nwmctrl -r 'Trine' -b add,above\n#activate it\nwmctrl -a 'Trine'\n\n\nA: Start it in new x-server, and switch desktop by keys CTRL+ALT+F7 or CTRL+ALT+F8.\nType xinit /path/to/the/game/executable -- :1 into a terminal.\n\nA: You can move to another desktop by clicking CTRL+ALT+→ or ←.\nIt will not minimize the game, but it should move you to another desktop where you can surf.\n\nA: The game has a bug that you need to report.\n\nA: I have found a very dirty solution for this problem. Insert a USB-Stick, a window with the file manager will pop up, your fullscreen application will be inactive. (Works only if it's not configured to do nothing instead...)\n\nA: Should be able to do CTRL+ALT+→ or CTRL+ALT+← if that doesn't work then something might be wrong with your game.\n\nA: I used to face this problem way too regularly and as far as I know it's a problem that needs to be addressed however it may be possible to use Alt+Enter to take the game out of fullscreen mode and then Alt+Tab. Pressing Alt+Enter again when the game has focus should then put it back into fullscreen mode.\n", "Q: Humble Bundle Game 'Trine' not working I downloaded the game Trine from the Humble frozenbyte Bundle and installed it on Ubuntu 10.10 but for some reason it fails to launch.\nI downloaded the Trine.32.run file and made it executable and then double clicked it and a installation dialogue opened and the game seemed to install properly, I got game launcher on Desktop and Application Menu but when I click on the game launcher, a window opens and when I click on Launch Nothing happens.\nHere is the error I get when I lanch it from command line by going into the installation directory...\ngaurav@gaurav-HCL-ME-Laptop:~/trine$ ./trine-launcher32 \n./trine-launcher32: ./lib32/libxml2.so.2: no version information available (required by /usr/lib/libglade-2.0.so.0)\nGot signal 11 at (nil) from (nil)\n./trine-bin32[0x8078188]\n[0x7e040c]\nAborted\n\nThis very same issue occurs on two of my computers.\nUPDATE :\nNow when I launch the game a message pops up saying \n\nError compiling shaders.

It needs to be safe from being overwritten when the system software is updated.\nIn the context of a PC without any networked computers what should be the directory to install a software that will be accessed by multiple local users? (i.e. where should I install a software like netbeans) \nThank you\n\nA: /opt is for third-party applications that don't rely on any dependencies outside the scope of said package. /usr/local is for packages installed on this machine outside the scope of the distribution package manager.\nAn example:\nAn open source sip-client supplied as a .deb would install into /usr. If it was built with the Qt framework, apt would pull it in as a dependency.\nThe same open source sip-client built from source would reside in /usr/localso it would not be messed up by apt if you later installed a .deb package for the same application. You could either build its dependencies from source, or get them from the package manager.\nA third-party application in /opt is supposed to be self-contained. For instance, a proprietary sip-client using Qt would not rely on the version from apt, but would have it bundled or statically linked in.\nFor more information, take a look at the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard.\n\nA: I would install third-party binary-only packages to /opt.\nAnything you build yourself from source I would put in /usr/local.\nnetbeans is in the Ubuntu Repos. Do you need a specific version?\n\nA: It's all about packaging. If something is packaged in the LHS way (putting executables into bin/ libraries into lib/ etc.) it should go into /usr/local. \nIf something has a top level directory and doesn't follow that model, it goes in /opt. Generally, you have to explicitly add stuff in /opt to your PATH. \nSee also This question on superuser\n", "Q: 2d story maker? I wonder if there is a software that enable you to easily build characters and make a story in 2d (without even drawing or rigging them). For instance, that provides you a complete character, like a doll, which can have different positions.\nAny suggestions?\n\nA: I know several programs that may fit:\n\n\n*\n\n*TBO (Gnome Comic maker)\n\n*Ktoon (KDE 2d Design authoring tool)\n\n*Pencil\nGuess TBO is closer to what you are looking for.\n\nA: Take a look at http://www.2dstoryengine.org/?page=demo&pagname=piggy . It's a demo for a freely available flash engine, which allows you to put your story on your website. \n\nA: The easiest I've found (at this point) to use partly prefabricated characters to easily make a strip has been to use an online comic generator.\nThe options change from year to year, but a search for something like \"online comic creator\" should get you a number of candidates.\nHowever, Papuix's recommendation for TBO sounded good, so I decided to look at it.  That link was dead, and the best link for TBO that I can find to a third-party PPA: https://www.ubuntuupdates.org/ppa/getdeb_apps?dist=precise\nIt does seem to work in 12.04.   The tutorial is in Spanish, and oddly, it consists of just page after page of text without images.\nTBO works like this:  you create a frame (i.e., rectangle) of some size with the frame tool, then double-click it.  From there, you are now able to use the formerly grayed-out icons to add (stock) characters, text bubbles, text, and so on.  There are a few included characters and some basic character outlines with a few different mouths, eyes, etc.  It's a bit limited.  I had some fun with it, but you'd have to import your own art to give it more than a very limited scope.\nIt made me think of 'potato guy' aka ktuberling, which is, I suppose, intended for kids, but is conceptually not much different.  It also has a few included backgrounds (e.g, Egypt, the moon, a robot space station), and probably more available characters (e.g., the robot pieces can be assembled various ways) than TBO.  It doesn't have the generic set up of frames, though, which is a decent feature if you are actually doing a strip-like comic.\nOther than these, I'd really just recommend importing art into inkscape (or your favorite paint/drawing program) and going from there.  Or even starting with some basic shapes in those programs, then saving and re-using them.  This would be less limiting, and not much more work, than trying to use some of the partially prefab options that are currently available.\n", "Q: How do I make a smart playlist of my purchased music?

This has happened to me many times in the last 5 years: an upgrade broke my system.\nEach time I end up with this situation, I have to reinstall the whole system, which is really annoying.\nIs there any way to roll back the most recent upgrade to be able to have a functional system without reinstalling? If not, which is the best way to suggest this as a top priority idea? \nI read this idea was described in brainstorm.ubuntu.com, but it feels it is dead... and the forums are full of examples of upgrades breaking things, that's why I feel something needs to be done about this topic.\nThanks!\n\nA: Most of the time if your system is broken it is a kernel problem.\nSimply boot an older kernel and reinstall the most recent packages (especially kernel packages) that probably didn't update correctly.\nFew notes:\n/var/log/dpkg.log\n\nis your friend to check what is the list of the recently updated/installed packages\nsudo apt-get -f install\n\ncan most of the time fix half-installed packages\n\nA: Unfortunately there is no way to do this yet.  Filesystem level snapshot/rollback is one of the features of the upcoming btrfs, but it has a ways yet to become feature complete and stable enough to use as the default filesystem.\n\nA: When doing a major upgrade, I clone the disk using Clonezilla. Burn it on a CD, have a spare (external) HDD available and follow the instructions on the Clonezilla LiveCD. Choose the partition-image mode, this uses the least space.\nIf you think you've broken your system (or wish to revert any changes), simply boot in the Clonezilla LiveCD, select the image on your (external) HDD and restore it. As these images are a literal copy of every bit on your disk, this might take a few hours depending on your disk speed and connection speed (the connection between the data, usually an external USB HDD, and the computer).\nBy the way, this is called a backup method.\n\nA: You can install an older version of a given package (downgrade) with apt or dpkg easily. Finding an older version of the package is the problem as these often disappear from the pool and mirrors as updates roll in.\nIf you install the package from an install CD or an outdated mirror or a cache, you will also need to keep it pinned to the old version so it won't be upgraded until you allow that. Which means you have to watch for updates and test them until your problem is fixed. This is of course a problem since meanwhile (maybe forever) you'll be left with the unfixed, possibly insecure package. That means every user with some kind of system issue will be left in some random state until they can resolve it.\nAll software also isn't forwards compatible, so an older version of something may well not behave right when fed with newer configuration or data files. Obviously this is impossible to solve unless you also roll back all user data to a state before the upgrade was done.\nIt would be great if there was a way to do this, but it is massively problematic. Anyone who thinks there is a coherent solution should write a proposal and invite comments or, better yet, make a proof of concept solution (code, script, document). Trolling and whining is not constructive.\nBecause there is no clean technical solution, most software is developed (and integrated) with \"the only way is forward\" mentality. Trying to manage outdated versions is a waste of everyone's time. Found problems are fixed in newer versions ASAP. As a minor solution, I would like to see an archive of previous package versions kept somewhere for the occasional temporary workaround.\nMeanwhile you can report bugs and don't expect bleeding edge software to never fail. A fix, once found, should be in the next update. Devs are humans (mostly), and therefore fallible. Computers are fiddly and full of insane variety and detail. Defensively maintained systems using well-supported components and stable integrated software distribution can be very stable without becoming insecure or non-upgradeable despite this.\n\nA: In synaptics, you can at least control, what have been the recent updates: File-menu, history. \n(if synaptic is startable, with the broken system). So with an apt-...-command, to revert their update, it shouldn't be too hard. \nI guess there is a history-command for the command line too. \nMaybe you have to delete the whole package, and install a specific version. Afaik, it is possible to install a specific version, but I never had the need to do so. \nupdate: Looked up how to do with apt:\nFind packages installed in the last 3x24h: \nfind /var/lib/dpkg/info/ -name \\*.list -mtime -3 | sed 's#.list$##;s#.*/##' \n\nWith apt-cache policy, you see available versions of a program:\nsudo apt-cache policy PROGRAM:\n *** 3.6.7+build3+nobinonly-0ubuntu0.10.04.1 0\n        500 http://de.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ lucid-updates/main Packages\n        500 http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ lucid-security/main Packages\n        100 /var/lib/dpkg/status\n     3.6.3+nobinonly-0ubuntu4 0\n\nhere 3.6.7 and 3.6.3 . Now you know what earlier version might be installed (often not the immediate predecessor):\nsudo apt-get install PROGRAM=3.6.3\n\nThen you need to do an apt-pinning, to prevent future updates:\nCreate a new file in /etc/apt/preferences.d/ (if >= 10.4) named after your program, \nPackage: program\nPin: version 3.6.3*\nPin-Priority: 1000\n\n\nA: Mostly you can consult /var/log/apt/history.log for changes done by apt/synaptic. It's just a little forensic and alot of cut/paste to do.\nGo back to the date when your system was still working fine.\nFirst take all packages that got installed since then and put them together in an uninstall script. When the script has finished, start re-adding all removed packages again.\nAn example case:\nlogfile:\nStart-Date: 2014-05-28  21:28:11\nCommandline: synaptic\nInstall: libfglrx-amdxvba1:amd64 (13.12-3kali1, automatic), libgl1-fglrx-glx:amd64 (13.12-3kali1), glx-alternative-fglrx:amd64 (0.4.1kali1, automatic), libfglrx:amd64 (13.12-3kali1, au$\nRemove: fglrx-glx-ia32:amd64 (12-6+point-3)\nEnd-Date: 2014-05-28  21:28:27\n\nyou can see,\nlibfglrx-amdxvba1:amd64 libgl1-fglrx-glx:amd64 glx-alternative-fglrx:amd64 & libfglrx:amd64 \n\ngot installed by Synaptic. as like libfglrx:amd64 got removed by Synaptic.\nWe went the reverse order, so first we remove the newly installed packages and we re-add the packages that got removed.\nA working command for this case could looks like:\nsudo apt-get remove -y libfglrx-amdxvba1:amd64 libgl1-fglrx-glx:amd64 glx-alternative-fglrx:amd64 libfglrx:amd64 && sudo apt-get install -y libfglrx:amd64\n\nMaybe it wouldn't be the best idea to go without the -y switch - to have more control about the process (to avoid broken dependencies). Most of you wouldn't break their finger while do a few verification \"y\"\nIn most cases a rollback is possible this way, but if dependencies are already broken - you may run into a even bigger issue.\n\nA: Set up timeshift.\nIf an update breaks your system, restore the last good snapshot.\n\nA: Type \"sudo apt autoremove\" through terminal and press enter key on the keyboard. It will autoremove all the redundant and unwanted library packages (and hopefully those packages that broke your system).\nThen type \"sudo apt autoclean\" through terminal and press enter key on the keyboard. This will clean any unwanted files including those saved in the /temp directory.\nThen type \"sudo apt purge\" through terminal and press enter key on the keyboard. This will permanently remove all the files which are not necessary.\nOnce done this try reinstalling the programs which you need.\nAlways have a current image of your system handy. Use clonezilla to keep images always handy. Its difficult situation.

That doesn't seem to be an option at this stage so I'm setting my sights on just adding a window list that allows me to see what I have open without any mouse or keyboard actions.\n\nA: Here's a simple script using wmctrl and a tool I made to create appindicators:\nhttps://sites.google.com/site/redaea/cappind-py/examples/windowlist\nit requires wmctrl (apt-get it) and this tool => https://sites.google.com/site/redaea/cappind-py/\n\nA: No, nothing that I'm aware of. Are you a programmer? You could hack together a python script around wmctrl and export the window list as an Indicator. You could ask some a friend, someone on IRC or request OMGUbuntu to publish a request for you.\n\nA: Yes, you can do this (add a window list). Open a terminal and type in 'gnome-panel' and hit enter.  A panel should appear at the bottom. I unchecked 'expand' option and removed the trash can icon.  My bottom panel has 'show desktop icon', 'window list', and 'workplace switcher' which I changed to two, instead of four.  You will notice that your top panel has changed and you now have a window bar and you can add more now to that panel.  Hope this helps.  If you close the terminal, your panels will dissapear.

By default, in Ubuntu you're running either Compiz or Metacity. I don't think that either of those WMs has the option you're looking for. But there are many WMs out there. I seem to recall encountering at least one such WM years ago when I used to experiment with window managers.

Or does it not matter at all?\n\nA: On enigmail.net they say \n\nThunderbird on Linux\n  Many Linux distributions ship with their own customized version of Thunderbird. If you use your distribution's version of Thunderbird, you must use your distribution's version of Enigmail. If you get Thunderbird from the official site and install it yourself, though, you can use the official Enigmail releases provided by the Enigmail Project. \n\nBased on that I'd install from repos if that's how you got TB.\n\nA: I would recommend that you use the version from the add-ons website.

So far I'm liking the new Unity interface, but there are certain aspects of the Applications lens/dash that I find a bit inconvenient.  For example, I have about 30 games installed on my desktop.  \nWith the old main menu, I could edit the games into categories, and it was very quick to view all card games, or all arcade games.\nWith the current set-up, there's no problem if I know which game (or other program) I want, but if I want to browse through the games, it's less convenient.  Once I click on the Applications lens, I have to pick Games from the drop-down menu (which requires more mouse movements than before), and after that, the games remain unsorted, so I can't browse by category.  \nWhat I would like would be able to create a launcher buttons similar to the Applications button, for specific groups of programs, so that I could, for example, click on an 'Arcade' button in the launcher, and see a list of arcade games.  Is there (now or in the future) any way for someone without programming skills to do something like this?  (Ideally, it would be of a similar level of difficulty to editing the Gnome main menu.)\n\nA: Unfortunately there's no easy way to customize lenses, people need to write them. On the plus side they're easy for people to write, for example the Ask Ubuntu lens is about ~350 lines of code.\nPlease add your idea here; I'm constantly on the lookout for people to write lenses so put down some detail on what you'd like to see in the lens and maybe we'll get lucky and find someone.\n\nA: You could simply use the \"Classic Menu Indicator\" (For Ubuntu 12.04/11.10/11.04). I found instructions on how to install it here.\n\nA: Check out Drawers:\nA utility for organizing related items for easy launching from the Unity launcher. Drawers creates a launcher favorite for the Unity launcher panel that can contain any combination of files, applications, web links or directories. Just drop a file on the launcher or open drawer and it will be added. Left-clicking the launcher \"opens a drawer\" with an icon view of each item for launching. Right-clicking allows fast launching through quicklists.\nYou can nest one drawer in another too. http://launchpad.net/drawers\n\n\nA: Why is there no documentation how to write? I made the .place entry and get a empty lense. if I put in there the dbus name and path like the app lense has, I get an app lense. So I think there must be an extra file for the dbus where this is configured but I don't find this dbus files. It would be easier to learn how it works, if there is a documentation where the different files are located. If the Ask Ubuntu Lense is only 350 lines of code, are they all in the same file? If yes, where is this file and why can't I just look at it and edit it or look at it and learn how it works and where I have to put my own lense.\n\nA: look at the .desktop files in /usr/share/applications/\nyou have to edit them with an text editor and add a line:\n\nOnlyShowIn=KDE;\n\nThen your KDE application should only appear in KDE.\n", "Q: ThinkPad workaround for no \"super\" key My ThinkPad x43 has no Super key. Most of the keyboard shortcuts in 11.04 use this button:\nWhat are Unity's keyboard and mouse shortcuts?\nWhat to do with Unity now? Is there a way to map the Fn button to super or something like this?\n\nA: If you don't mind losing your left Alt key, you can swap it with the Win key.\nOpen the Keyboard control panel, go to the Layout tab and select Options....  Expand the Alt/Win key behaviour section, and select Left Alt is swapped with Left Win.\n\nA: Using the keyboard layout properties I set Caps Lock as another Super key and then it works the same way as a Windows key it seems. At least it opens the Dash.\n\nA: You can remap almost anything to Super. Assuming the below is really an x43 keyboard (the internet swears it is), I'd go for the page left/page right keys on either side of the up-arrow on the bottom right. You're likely to regret remapping Fn.  \nYou probably need to use xev and xmodmap.

You can install it by typing:  \nsudo apt-get install sysv-rc-conf\n\nrather than the ZSH prompt:\n[kahless /home/teward]% sysv-rc-conf  \nzsh: command not found: sysv-rc-conf\n\nNote I do not want to change the prompt itself, but I want to change the result from zsh: command not found to a bash-like output of The program 'progname' is currently not installed. You can install it by typing: or similar.\nIs this possible with ZSH?\n\nA: Note that you might want to add a check if the file exists if you are sharing your .zshrc across distributions that do not have a /etc/zsh_command_not_found file:\n[[ -a \"/etc/zsh_command_not_found\" ]] && . /etc/zsh_command_not_found\n\nAlso, in case you're using oh-my-zsh, there already is a plugin, command-not-found, that you can add to your plugins variable that does the same thing.\n\nA: If you are using oh-my-zsh, you can just instead look for \"plugins\" inside your .zshrc.\nAdd the command-not-found plugin to the list of plugins to autoload (this plugin is already installed by default).\nLike this:\n# Which plugins would you like to load?

Ubuntu installs it by default, and makes it active by default in bash but not in zsh. Just add this line to your ~/.zshrc:\n. /etc/zsh_command_not_found\n\n\nA: The way it works is through the command_not_found_handle() function in bash. bash provides a hook which is basically a function that is invoked when a command is not found. Ubuntu's bash implementation traps it and does a package search, while Debian's bash does not (and same with zsh). You may want to check out zsh's manpage to see if that has a similar function.\nHere is how you can get started, hoping zsh is similar.\nmpandit@mpandit-ubuntu:~$ command_not_found_handle() {echo 'Handler: Command not found!';}\nmpandit@mpandit-ubuntu:~$ ddaadada\n'Handler: Command not found!\nmpandit@mpandit-ubuntu:~$\n\n\nA: Also if you don't want zsh to have this behavior 100% of the time you can just manually do something like:\n/usr/lib/command-not-found urxvt\nor add command-not-found to your $PATH\n", "Q: How to change the shortcut to adjust brightness?

Learn the correct American English pronunciation of the Linux distribution.\n\n\nA: Here's Nelson Mandela ...  Short clip : The Meaning of Ubuntu .\nActually, you get the interviewer pronouncing Ubuntu twice,  and you'll hear Mandela pronounce Ubuntu near the end of the clip.\nTo attempt a quick summary, the bun is close to Boone in Daniel Boone or \\bün\\ ; \nand tu is close to too, or \\tü\\ .   The initial u matches this sound. \n\nA: Here's a very short clip from an interview with another very famous person demonstrating the correct pronunciation of Ubuntu :-)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGox0EKqiaE\n\nA: Official\nFrom the Wikipedia page on Ubuntu:\n\n(/ʊˈbʊntuː/ (listen) uu-BUUN-too)[1]\n\nThis is written in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) followed by Wikipedia's English respelling system.\n\n*\n\n*The vowels are /ʊ/ uu as in FOOT and /uː/ oo as in GOOSE.\n\n*The consonants /b, n, t/ are pronounced as they're written.\n\n*The second syllable is emphasized.\n\n*The colon-like symbol after /u/ is just a length marker, which isn't very important in English.\n\nThe citation here is the official About Ubuntu page, where the pronunciation is written |oǒ'boǒntoō|. I'm not sure what system that's written in, but it might be a variant of the pre-IPA Oxford system, described here under the \"POD\" column.\nUnofficial\nAnother pronunciation I've heard in North American English is /uˈbʌntu/ oo-BUN-too, with /ʌ/ as in STRUT. Another is /juˈbʌntu/ you-BUN-too, with the first syllable /ju/ = \"you\", which is arguably incorrect. The second syllable is emphasized in both of these.\nZulu\nWhile we're here, it's worth mentioning that the word \"ubuntu\" originally comes from the Bantu languages (e.g. Xhosa, Zulu). I've never heard this used to refer to the OS, but for context, Wikipedia has the Zulu pronunciation on the page Ubuntu philosophy:\n\n[ùɓúntʼù][1][2]\n\nThis is way more complicated for an English speaker. The accents indicate tones, the /ɓ/ is an implosive, and the /tʼ/ is an ejective.\n\nA: ou.boon.too = ubuntu\nIn most languages from southern Africa, ubuntu = humanity to others, bantu = people.\nIn some languages the \"b\" is pronunced as a \"w\", for instance my name \"Buyongo\" is pronunced \"Wuyongo\". A westerner will make the mistake of saying buy.on.go, which is incorrect. Another example is Busisiwe which is said Wusisiwe even though it has the letter B.\nSo if you used a genuine southern African accent to pronunce it, it would sound more like ou.woon.tu, but for simplicity sake lets just say ou.boon.too.  It's the popular way anyhow. :)\n", "Q: Troubleshooting wireless network connection: DNS not working I have a wireless router that assigns IPs using DHCP.  My laptop (Acer Aspire 1 110L running Ubuntu 10.10) connects to the wireless network, but DNS is not working.  I've tried to trouble shoot the problem following various tutorials on ubuntu help, but I'm stuck.\n(My laptop works fine with other wireless networks, and other computers can connect to the Internet using the router in question.  My laptop worked fine with this router until a few weeks ago.  Unfortunately I don't know what changed to cause the problem.

I can't ping other names (e.g., www.askubuntu.com) or addresses (e.g., 64.34.119.12).\nWhat should I do next to try to fix this problem?\nThanks!\n\nA: /etc/resolv.conf contains your DNS listings. 192.168.0.1 is obviously the router in question. You need to manually provide the nameserver(s) provided to you by your isp. You can usually get this information under the router/status page. In your case the router is not a nameserver and therefore will not resolve DNS.\nNetwork-Manager will overwrite the /etc/resolv.conf to accomadate dhcp configured connections. Playing around with mixed static and dhcp connections can sometimes trigger this file to be overwritten.

It seems to hang while trying to ask you for your password to authorize the update. For some reason it needs root to have a password. I simply 'passwd root' and 'kill -9'ed the process running 'vmware-gksu' then tried again. And voila: after the download a window popped up and asked me for my password.\n\nA: Try to run it from console and observe the output. There is probably some interactive part.\n\nA: This happens when fingerprint auth is enabled. If you touch thew fingerprint right after it enters pending state, it would either proceed or ask for password if your fingerprint isn't recognized.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 32 or 64 bit \nPossible Duplicate:\nWhat is the difference between 32bit and 64 bit and which should I chose? \n\nI bought a new lenovo ideapad Y560 with corei5 processor and windows7 64bit, but beside the windows I want to try the ubuntu too, but I need advice in this case, as I know this processors are supporting the 64bit architecture(win7 64bit still running on this), so what would be better, the ubuntu 32bit or 64bit, on this laptop. \n\nA: try 64bit Ubuntu. it will give you good performance under i5 processor. Nowadays you will find 64bit versions for all important applications. Even flash has a 64bit alpha release which is quite stable. However, if you are an avid facebook user, you will have to use the 32 bit flash, as facebook fails to recognize 64bit flash. 32bit flash sometimes causes problems with certain websites on 64 bit ubuntu. Apart from that all applications run fine. \nMy vote: 64bit Ubuntu on i5 processor :)\n\nA: Through ia32 libs, the 64 bit version of ubuntu will be able to run 32 and 64 bit applications, so you would not miss out on anything. If you have 4gb of RAM or more, then you would also benefit from improved performance from the 64 bit version.\n\nA: This article in Phoronix seems to confirm that 64-bit is faster than 32-bit in most cases.  If your computer is capable of running a 64-bit OS, you probably should.\n", "Q: How do I remove all programs connected to Wine and Wine with one command?

Is there any precaution you need to take while using ubuntu? Because i dont use any antivirus available for ubuntu! So any security changes do i need to make while surfing on the net? \n\nA: Keep your system up to date by updating it each time the update manager lanches.\n\nA: Ubuntu is inherently more secure than Windows because of its Unix heritage, which was built for security from day one. Also there are apps in ubuntu like app armor that provide protection against buffer overrun attacks in your web browser and other programs.\nThe concept of root users is something that has come from Unix and makes it impossible for a user to do anything that could permanently effect your machine without being a root user or being temporarily promoted to root (such as with sudo). Because root is so powerful be very, very careful what you allow to run as root because once it gets you permission to run as root it can do anything it wants. \nOther than that really the only thing you need to do (if you are running a desktop machine with no servers running on it) is keep the system up to date.\n\nA: Good to see you are concerned about security. i assume you are a windows user, who has switched to, or trying out ubuntu. You do not need an antivirus product, because simply said, the architecture of linux is such, it is much less prone to malware. If you are still concerned you can use solutions like clamav and gufw ( available in software center) tpo further strengthen your defenses.\n\nA: Use script-blocking extensions for your browser that are available for Firefox, Chromium and Midori.  \nThe majority of vulnerablities which Joesephine Public may be subjected to these days consist of alterations to a website's Javascript - the language which provides the dynamic, interactive elements of a web-page. An attacker will mainly use javascript to infect a computer with malware and this will not usually affect you if you run Ubuntu. But he/she may also use it to subtly modify a webpage in order to steal a password and in this case Ubuntu will not protect you.\nThe best of these script-blockers is easily No-Script for Firefox which is capable of not only blocking scripts, but also of providing Cross-Site-Scripting protection for those websites which you have whitelisted. It also blocks plugins such as Flash and Java, click-jacking and web-bugs. At first No-Script can be annoying because it will cripple many websites you visit, but gradually, as you whitelist the websites you trust, it will bother you less and less. I recommend to learn the keyboard shortcut to bring up the contextual menu (which can be changed in about:config) and to read a little the documentation on he web-site.  \nAn Ad-blocker is something else to consider, since many of your trusted websites may serve you dodgy ads.\n", "Q: How to add my favorite places as a quicklist in my home's icon in Unity?

Unfortunately, support for this relatively new family is not complete and still in development. So, you can forget this driver for now, it might get better over a year.\nI am not sure why ubuntu-x-swat contains a driver with version 270.41.03, because the properietary nvidia drivers (32bit and 64bit) are of version 260.19.44.\n\nA: Problem solved.

I'd like to setup a region on my desktop in the same manner. Between conky, pidgin, pandora, and a couple of widgets, I have a group of items I want to always be able to view. \"Always on Top\" is not good enough,\nI don't even know which part of the \"stack\" (X, Compix, Metacity, Gnome...) controls this behavior, and my google-fu was too weak to find the answer.\nThanks!\n(Re-Post from Superuser.com, No answer over there in 2 days so I thought I'd give it a shot here.\n\nA: Maximumize may be useful for that case instead of Maximize. Which is included in the CompizConfig Settings Manager and will \"Maximumize windows (resize them to fit the available screenspace)\"\nIn your case, Maximumize will fit the window's size in order to use the maximum available screen space in the active work space and this way, windows in screen containing the pidgin, conky, and other window-like applications will be dodged by the Maximumized window. I am not sure if this will act the same with docklets but you give it a try and please let us know.\nGood luck!\nBTW: You may need to set your own key bindings in order to make this work. I used [Alt]+M and it works fine for me.\n\n\n\nA: I think I've discovered the canonical solution to this problem, which is almost the same as my question: Maximize windows to physical screen when using a virtual resolution w/xrandr (read my self-answer there; it explains more).  The trick is to set up an intricate \"output\" system in Compiz.\nIf you use the Compiz configuration tool (described in my answer to that question) you simply want to set up two outputs: one of them equal to the exact resolution of your screen (or virtual desktop, as considered there), and the other one of the size and position you want to have windows in.\nFor example, if you have a 1024x768 screen and you only want windows to maximize into the 800x600 region in the upper left, you would put two outputs into Compiz' config box: \"1024x768\" and \"800x600-224-168\": the minus signs say that those offsets are measured from the bottom and right, rather than top and left.  You also have to do the other things I say in that answer: disable autodetection of outputs and enable \"prefer smaller output\".\nThen you place your widgets in the margin that lies only in the larger output (in the example, that 224px-high strip at the bottom or 168px-wide strip on the right) and open all your other windows into the smaller output; they will maximize just to the smaller region.\n", "Q: Command line interface to make a ogg mono from stereo Is there a command-line interface I can use to make one or more ogg-music-files into mono?\n\nA: sox is a nice tool for all sorts of command line audio processing\nsox your_inputfile.ogg your_outputfile.ogg remix -\n\n\nA: You can use it with oggdec and oggenc.

However, it is straightforward and easily combined in a shellscript if so desired.\noggdec myfile.ogg\noggenc --downmix myfile.wav -o myfile_mono.ogg\nrm myfile.wav\n\nIf you wish to control the output quality, run oggenc with the -q flag with a value from -1 (very low) to 10 (very high)\n", "Q: How can I use Alltray in Unity?

I just installed Ubuntu Natty beta 2 on my system. And I also keep regular track of the milestones of Unity in Launchpad. When I downloaded Ubuntu Natty beta the Unity version was 3.8.6. However few hours ago they released the 3.8.8 version.\nI need to know the version since it will help me test the features which were added and other stuff.\nHow can I find out which version of Unity I am running on Ubuntu Natty beta 2? \n\nA: Type into terminal:\nunity --version\n\nHopefully that's exactly what you want.\nAlternatively, click on the Applications tab in the Unity Launcher and search \"Synaptic\". You should see \"Synaptic Package Manager\", open it, and then search \"Unity\" in the search bar (or Quick Filter, as it's called). Your version should be listed underneath the \"Installed Version\" column.\n\nA: For Unity-2D:\nYou can run the following command in a terminal and you would know what version is installed in your system:\napt-cache policy unity-2d\n\nor\ndpkg -l unity-2d\n\nFor Unity:\nSimilarly for Unity,\napt-cache policy unity\n\nor\ndpkg -l unity\n\n", "Q: Radio tray icon applet does not load in Unity The Radio Tray icon will not show in Ubuntu 11.04 (Natty Narwhal) Beta 2 under Unity, but it works in classic mode.\nI have it set as a startup application using the command /usr/bin/radiotray. It loads perfectly in classic mode, but not at all in Unity.\nHow can I get Radio Tray to work when I use Unity?\n\nA: The latest version from sourceforge (at the time of writing this, it is version 0.6.4) now has both app-indicator support (for Natty) and notification area support (for other ubuntu variants and versions before 11.04).\nInstall the application via\ncd Downloads \nsudo dpkg -i radiotray_0.6.4_all.deb\n\nthen start the application:\nnohup radiotray &\n\nthis will display the choice screen:\n\nClick OK for Natty (or change the option).\nRadiotray should appear in the app-indicators area of Natty.\nTo get Radiotray starting automatically - open Natty dash and search for startup application.  You can then add a new entry with the command line radiotray\n\nA: Well I donot know if this will work for radio tray but it is working for covergloobus and gnote in my case. To add custom notification tray in unity\nFirst do :\ngsettings get com.canonical.Unity.Panel systray-whitelist \nto see the systray whitelist. \nthen append \ngsettings set com.canonical.Unity.Panel systray-whitelist \"['your settings here', 'radiotray']\"\n\nEDIT: Webupd8 explains your need\n\nA: I just installed this program in Ubuntu 12.04. Ran it first time OK then it refused to open again. The initial startup script gives the option to enable the \"Gnome Media Keys\" plugin. I had enabled this option and it seems that this is what prevented the application from starting again.\nThe solution was to remove the Gnome Media Keys section from the active plugins line in the config.xml file. Works fine after that.\n\nA: Unity does not support gnome-applets, and most applications will not work in the system tray (notification area) unless they are ported to indicator applets, so it is unlikely that radiotray will work in this situation.\n\nA: This website shows you how.\nhttp://www.webupd8.org/2011/04/how-to-enable-ubuntu-appindicator-for.html\n\nA: Although radiotray now has application indicator support the default setting is set to \"false\" when it should be set to \"true\". You will find the configuration file in the home folder at /.local/share/radiotray/config.xml. You will need to set file manager to show hidden files in order to see the .local folder. The dot ( . ) makes the file hidden from normal file manager use.\nThese are the lines to change:\n\n\nChange false to true. While you are there change the default sleep_timer value from 15 to 60 or 120 otherwise radiotray will stop working after 15 minutes. And you will find that you cannot reset it unless you reboot.\nThis is the command to put in a terminal to both load gedit and the document config.xml. You need to use sudo to let you save the changes.\ngksudo gedit ~/.local/share/radiotray/config.xml\nDid is what I had to do to get radiotray working under Unity just a few days ago.\nRegards.\n", "Q: Is there a Battery indicator? Generally when using my laptop, in Maverick the battery icon used to show up in the panel giving me an indication of the battery status and also allowing me to set the performance of the machine like Performance, Normal, On Demand, Power Save etc. \nHowever I have Ubuntu natty installed on my dell inspiron 1525 and it did not show any battery info on the panel.

Or you can add extra bit of features with this applet. Instructions on using it with indicator system of ubuntu is also mentioned. If it is not present for your ubuntu distribution just download deb file and install. \nFor natty: Just download maverick version of deb file from ppa and add /usr/lib/battery-status/battery-status --indicator to your startup application.

When you ran the apt-get remove command, then only the texlive package was uninstalled, not its dependencies.\nYou can easily remove these extra unneeded dependencies by running:\nsudo apt-get autoremove\n\n\nA: sudo apt-get remove texlive\nsudo apt-get autoremove\nsudo apt-get remove tex-common\n\nThen download and install directly from TUG.\nYou can choose your operating system there.\nThis has a bunch of packages and is much more complete than other distributions.\nMuch better than sudo apt-get install latex.\n\nA: This removes all latex packages:\nsudo apt-get purge --auto-remove texlive*\n\n", "Q: move main menu from top panel to top of the window? \nPossible Duplicate:\nDoes Unity support disabling the global application menu? \n\nIs there a way to move program's main menu (The one that says File, Settings, Help, ....) from the top panel Unity's panel to the top of the window, like it was before?

Can I use rsync to /rsnapshot-backups/localhost/ syncing it to rsync server.\n\nA: Another option is to use a reverse ssh tunnel and then to a \"remote\" pull from the receiver's side:\n#!/bin/bash -x\nIVAL=${1:-hourly}\nssh -vNR 1998:localhost:22 example.com &\nssh example.com \"rsnapshot -c pull-from-sender-rsnapshot.conf ${IVAL}\"\n\nwhere pull-from-sender-rsnapshot.conf might contain a line like: \nbackup localhost:1998/etc/  desktop-1\n\nThis could be invoked by cron on the sender's side, triggering the remote rsnapshot locally.\n\nA: I developed rsnappush specifically to solve same problem you're encountering, and actually came across your post because I was looking for a pre-built solution (that didn't exist yet).\nSYNOPSIS\nrsnappush [-h] [-r RSYNC_OPT] [-q] SOURCE_PATH [ACCOUNT:]DEST_PATH\nDESCRIPTION\nrsnappush is a wrapper around rsync(1) to assist in file-level\nincremental snapshots that are pushed to a destination.\nUnchanged files are hard-linked.  Files are plainly laid\nout in a directory for each snapshot: DEST_PATH/backup-YYYYmmdd-HHMM/\nfor easy access and restoration.\nSOURCE_PATH is any local path.\nDEST_PATH is a path, local or remote.  If remote, ACCOUNT specifies\nan ssh(1)-compatible account description, such as USER@HOST.\nAdditionally, under DEST_PATH there is a permissions/ directory\ncreated that has compressed output from getfacl(1).  setfacl(1) can be used\nto restore permissions from this file once it is uncompressed.\nEXAMPLE\nrsnappush --rsync-opt=--partial-dir=/home/user2/rsync-partial \\\n          /home/user user2@remotehost:backups/\n\n\nA: Rsnapshot is pull-based by design. The power of Rsnapshot lies in using hard links, and that only works for local file systems. (nfs could be used as it supports hard links, but not for instance sshfs).\nIn a push scenario, the best solution is to simply push to to a backup directory on the server using rsync, and then allow rsnapshot handle snapshotting from that directory, as it was designed to. Rsnapshot doesn't care if changes were introduced by an rsync or by saving a file.\nIn the rsnapshot FAQ there is a fancy solution that triggers rsnapshot after the rsync, but that could be overkill. Just running rsnapshot from its recular cron jobs works just as well.\nAn alternative solution is rdiff-backup, however this does not present a nice directory view of each snapshot and requires running commands to restore files, which may complicate fast restoring.\n", "Q: Unable to open \"Windows Network\" to see other computers on LAN I have my machine connected to our office LAN which has many other machines that use win XP, win 7 etc. Until a month or so ago, I was able to share files and folders with them, but now I can't even see what machines are there on my LAN, let alone access their files. I tried accessing a machine by its name, by opening smb://machinename, but that says\nError: Failed to retrieve share list from server\nPlease select another viewer and try again.\n\nI tried restarting samba with sudo service samba restart, but that says samba: unrecognized service, but then samba is shown as installed in synaptic.\nI am pretty much stuck on this. Any ideas on how to fix this?\n\nA: A bit too late answer but seems some people are still experiencing same problem. It is often happen that the problem lays not on client side (Ubuntu) but on server-side. \nFirst of all I would suggest to check the firewall settings on Windows side. For example on Windows 7 I had to open TCP port 445 for SMB and UDP 137, 138 / TCP 137, 139 for NetBios API.\nIn order to do this go to Windows box and open:\nControl Panel > Firewall > Advanced Settings > Inbound Rules > Add Rule... \n\nAdd rules for each port mentioned above. Then you may try to connect from Ubuntu. In case you are still not able to connect - open the terminal and run commands to see shares\n$ findsmb\n$ smbtree\n\n(hit enter when prompted for a password)\nFrom the output of smbtree find the Windows station name and run\n$ smbclient -L [NAME]\n\nSince this moment you will be either connected to Share or will get an error code which will give you a hint about the origin of problem. For example, my error message was NT_STATUS_BAD_NETWORK_NAME (Windows computer name contained not allowed character) and the problem was fixed in 2 minutes.\nHope this information will be helpful.\n\nA: Basically you can try viewing network in nautilus with network:/// in nautilus location bar. As for restarting samba server I think try replacing samba in your service command with smb or smbd. Or try using machine ip rather than machine name.\n\nA: The problem turned out to be the firewall. Disable it with\nsudo ufw disable\n\ndid the trick.\n\nA: That is a terrible and unsafe solution to completely turn off your firewall. \nBetter one?

Every time I reinstall Ubuntu, the default sensitivity settings are much too low (it feels like I really have to push to move the cursor).\nI've been changing this manually for quite a few releases now, creating startup scripts to automatically change obscure configuration files as denoted at ThinkWiki.org. About a year ago, I found gpointing-device-settings, which looked like the answer to my prayers (and in some ways it is). Unfortunately, despite the description and pictures on the gnome.org page, I cannot use this GUI to control the Trackpoint sensitivity (it's not an option).\nI've also heard of configure-trackpoint, but last I tried (a year ago) it didn't save your sensitivity settings (you need to make a startup script). I really dislike opening a Terminal and/or creating scripts to set my Trackpoint mouse sensitivity. Is there any way around all this using a GUI?

My Thinkpad HD went bad, so I opted for an upgrade to a 500gb one. How should I partition it, and in what order? Looking around various forums, I've come up with the following scheme so far:\n/dev/sda\n    /dev/sda1  Primary  ext4   /boot   499 MB\n    /dev/sda2  Primary  ext4   /       19999 MB\n    /dev/sda3  Primary  swap           5999 MB\n    /dev/sda5  Logical  ext4   /home   473606 MB\n\nShould I add separate partitions for /usr, /var, or any others? And does it matter what order I create them? I seem to remember reading a long time ago that your swap partition should always be at the end of your disk.\nI'm fairly new at this, but I love Ubuntu.\nThank you, Mike\n\nA: I would let the installer take care of that. E.g., for a typical user there's no reason to put /boot in its own partition.\nThe only thing you could think about, is to put the /home folder on a separate partition, as this will make it easier to backup your data with partition-based backup tools.\n\nA: I generally follow below. Though I'm not expert on technical merits, I found below way of partitioning is useful to me. Keeping swap in the beginning of extended partition gives flexibility that it need not to be touched ever. In case later, if I ever want to merge to partitions into one or split partitions into 2, I can do it. If I keep swap at the end, it interfere in that case. \nSecond, I do create  /sroot (secondary root partition) - Its mainly for, upgrade purpose. Before I move to newer version Ubuntu on every 6 months, I first installed on it here and run it for a while. Once everything is set, I will install on primary root partitions. It gives flexibility in moving back to previous Ubuntu if something not working. Also, I test pre-release ubuntu version using this one.\n/data - I keep movies, music, pictures and any other documents (like firefox, thunderbird, profiles, other app profiles, ) and I make soft link with directory from /home. This helps me if I ever want to do complete (clean clean) installation of Ubuntu. It take care of removing any kind of residual config with existing Gnome or any other apps on upgrade to newer versions.\nI also , leave some space for Windows partitions if its laptop. Some case you might really wanted to run Windows because some of providers (netflix, etc) doesnt run fully on Ubuntu and running over Virtual Machine isn't that smoother experience. \n/swap - 2GB\n/     - 20GB\n/home - 100GB\n/data - [rest of hard-disk]\n/sroot - 10GB [Secondary root]\nI don't give partition for /boot. Its not needed if you are classic user like browsing and do some personal computing. /boot could be just a directory under /.\n\nA: I usually partition as follows:\n/ primary usually 25-50 GB of space as you have 500 GB. I have 320 GB and I gave it 25 GB.\n/home for rest of space - swap allocation.\nswap is recommended to be double of memory I think but I have given 5GB to swap as I have 4 GB of physical RAM.\nBoth /home and swap are on logical extended partitions \n\nA: I'll mirror what others have said here and say ditch the /boot partition. To be honest, when I've made /boot partitions in the past it's only caused problems as kernels, etc. fill it up. There are some theoretical benefits to having a separate /boot partition such as allowing the user to format that partition with a filesystem that's particularly suited to reading kernel files. For the life of me, I don't know which filesystem performs best at this task.\nThe most important thing is to make a separate /home partition.\nIf you plan on installing a lot of packages 20 GB may be a little low for /.\n\nA: Unless you have special requirements, just choose the guided install and let it worry about it.  The default configuration of one partition for swap, and one for everything else is best for most people ( which is why it is the default ).\nUnless you have an old broken bios that can't see the whole disk, there is no reason to have a separate /boot partition.  There is no reason at all to have a /var or anything else.  Some people like to have a separate /home partition, but I have yet to see a very good reason for doing so.  The usual reason cited is so you can reinstall Ubuntu without loosing your personal files, but you have been able to do this for years without a separate /home by simply un checking the format box.\n", "Q: How to install Covergloobus?

I'm using Ubuntu 10.10 Maverick Meerkat in dual boot with Windows XP SP3 and am having issues while installing packages/programs in Ubuntu. Not that they don't install but parallel installation is not supported. By this i mean, I can't install updates while software center is installing. is there a way I can configure this?\n\nA: You cannot install two program simultaneously in Ubuntu. If you tried this in the terminal you would have got the message that apt-get is in use by an other application and is locked. Infact if you were installing two application in the Ubuntu Software Center it would first finish the installation of the first before it starts installing the second application.\nTechnical Explanation\nThis is because Ubuntu is based on Debian and Debian package management is based on apt, which is based in turn on dpkg. dpkg uses a very simple lock-file semantic for protection of its databases. While dpkg is installing from one or more .deb packages, no other dpkg process can alter the database. Further, while one apt-get process is downloading packages, no other apt-get process can run except in download-only mode.\nThis is something you cannot override this atleast to my knowledge. \n\nA: No. The package management system needs a global lock to keep the meta-data (list of installed packages etc.) consistent. Update-Manager, Software-Center, Synaptic, Aptitude -- all of them are frontends to the Advanced Packaging Tool (APT) which, in turn, adds networking and repositories to the Debian Package Management Tool (dpkg).\n\nA: Answer is no but what you can can try , \nSelect all the software/packages you want through synaptics and then just hit install, this way you will not have to select again and again , it will install one after another internally , but anyway you can also update all through synaptics .. like all together.\n\nA: you can try to install trough synaptics package manager, you can search what program do you want to install ex : \"internet browser\".  \nhere some exemple how to install skype from synaptics :http://www.ubuntubuzz.com/2011/03/install-firefox-4-via-apt-get-or.html\nsynaptics is same with apt-get install, you can use one of them\n", "Q: Ubuntu Server Automatically Insert Password Using Python3 I'm trying to create a small python3 program for my friend which will install and configure the nessarcary set-up for his Ubuntu Server.\nI want him to be able to start the program, give some basic information and be able to just leave the program to run.\nThe thing is, to do this I need the python file to send the password to the CL when requested for sudo commands.\nI tried doing this for updating the Ubuntu Server:\nos.system('sudo aptitude update && sudo aptitude dist-upgrade')\nos.system(password)\n\nAfter having the program request the password with this:\npassword=input('Please Enter Your Password')\n\nBut it didn't work. The CL just sits there waiting for the user to enter the password manually. Is ther anyway to get around this?\nThanks!\n\nA: There are some solutions that put in the password automatically, but as they are visible in clear text for a moment, those are dangerous and you should not use them. Some methods are discussed here.\nThis is the proper way to run a python program as root:\nimport os\nimport sys\nimport subprocess\n\n\ndef main():\n    status, output = subprocess.getstatusoutput(\"apt-get update\")\n    return status\n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    if os.getuid():\n        print(\"This program needs to be run with root privileges,\")\n        print(\"please use `sudo ./{0}` to execute it\".format(*sys.argv))\n        sys.exit(100)\n    else:\n        sys.exit(main())\n\n\nAnd the clear text method:\n\nThis is dangerous\n  Your password will be visible to users on the system in the clear\n  Be advised, passwords should never be stored anywhere, ever.\n\npassword = \"password1\"\nsubprocess.getstatusoutput(\n    \"echo {} | sudo -S apt-get update\".format(password))\n\n\nOn a related note, the best way to prompt a user for a password is using getpass:\nimport getpass\npassword = getpass.getpass(prompt='Password: ')\n\nThis won't print the password as on the screen while the user is typing, as you'd expect on a Linux system.\n\nimport os\nimport sys\nimport subprocess\n\n\ndef main():\n    print(\"hello world, we're root!\")\n    return 0\n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    if os.getuid():\n        os.system(\"sudo python3 \" + ' '.join(sys.argv))\n        sys.exit(100)\n    else:\n        sys.exit(main())\n\nThis solution, instead of asking the user, runs itself as root if necessary. \n", "Q: syntax for SOCKS proxy in apt.conf I want to add SOCKS proxy settings to /etc/apt/apt.conf. What is the syntax for it? Is it same as http and ftp syntax?\nThanks.\n\nA: I couldn't find anything on Acquire::socks::proxy in the apt.conf manual of Ubuntu Xenial. You could fix this by running a local http proxy that supports upstream socks proxy, for example Polipo. You need to configure Polipo as follows:\nproxyAddress = \"::1\"\nproxyPort = 8118\nsocksParentProxy = \"sockshost:socksport\"\nsocksProxyType = socks5\n\nand then set the http proxy in your apt.conf file:\nAcquire::http::proxy \"http://127.0.0.1:8118/\";\nAcquire::https::proxy \"https://127.0.0.1:8118/\";\n\n\nA: Acquire::http::proxy \"socks5h://server:port\";\n\nThis works for me on Ubuntu 18.04.\nAs the man page says, socks5h, not socks5, is supported by apt, which means socks5 proxy with DNS resolving ability.\n\nA: Or tou can put in your /etc/apt/apt.conf something like this:\nAcquire::socks::proxy \"socks://user:pass@host:port/\";\n\n\nA: A possible solution can be to use tsocks, an application that can redirect the network traffic through a socks proxy.\nInstall tsocks package, modify /etc/tsocks.conf to set address and port number of your socks proxy, and run:\n$ sudo -s\n# tsocks apt-get update\n# tsocks apt-get dist-upgrade\n# exit\n$\n\nor\n$ sudo -s\n# . tsocks -on\n# apt-get update\n# apt-get dist-upgrade\n# . tsocks -off # not really necessary, given the exit\n# exit\n$\n\nYou can think to a number of options, to simplify and automate its use.\nDon't forget the leading dot, the Manpage has more deatails on this.\nEdit: a shorter way to use it:\n$ sudo tsocks apt-get update\n$ sudo tsocks apt-get dist-upgrade\n\n\nA: Using the next config line works for me:\nAcquire::socks::proxy \"socks5://server:port\";\n\nTo keep apt.conf clean and avoid problems at Linux upgrade I created a new file (/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/12proxy) and added the config file to it.\n\nA: In Debian, you can read the manpage apt-transport-http(1) and look for supported URI schemes. As was answered before, put\nAcquire::http::proxy \"socks5h://server:port\";\n\nin\n/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/12proxy\n\nYou can read more about the APT-config in general in apt.conf(5) and read the examples in /usr/share/doc/apt/examples/configure-index.gz mentioned at the end of the manpage.\nThis can be combined with ssh -D <LOCAL PORT> <USER>@<HOST> to create a SOCKS proxy to a different system so that apt can then use the proxy as if everything originated on <HOST>.\nIf you use ssh -D 0.0.0.0:<LOCAL PORT> <USER>@<HOST> or ssh -D [::]:<LOCAL PORT> <USER>@<HOST> (for IPv6) to enable other systems to use the SOCKS proxy on all interfaces. This can be a security risk or breach of (corporate) policy. Make sure you know what you are doing.\n", "Q: Reopen A Python File Where It Left Off After Restarting I am creating a quick python3 program and at one part the server will need to be restarted.

What is cygwin compiler and how can I install it?\nI have no Internet connection and am unable to install any .tar.gz file. An online forum suggested me that I should compile these files. What is this compilation, will the previously mentioned cygwin compiler work for me to compile these sources?\n\nA: Cygwin compiler is used to compile POSIX programs (like those used on Linux) to MS-Windows. It hardly ever useful on a Linux desktop, unless you want to \"cross-compile\" programs for MS-Windows from your Ubuntu desktop.\nI suspect that you what you want to do is to download software that comes in .tar.gz archives (also known as \"tarballs\") and use these on your Ubuntu desktop. To do that you need a compiler, but not Cygwin - you need GCC. Use Ubuntu's Software Center to install \"gcc\", then open your tarball (the archive that ends with .tar.gz) to an empty directory, open a terminal and cd to that directory then run ./configure and if that completes without errors, run make and make install. That will get the software installed for your local user. You might also want to read the Compiling Easy How To document to learn how to best approach this process.\nIts important to note that most software you'd want to use is already included in Ubuntu's Software Center, so I suggest you always start your software search there - software distributed by Ubuntu is much more likely to be safer and better then what you download from the internet. Even if you can't find exactly what you are looking for likely you can find useful alternatives.\n", "Q: Screen freezes upon screensaver when playing video Trying to install Natty on a Pent dual, core 2.50 GHz, 4gb ram, nvidia 8400 with 260.19.44. I have 10.10 installed and it works perfect. When i install 11.04 all goes well but when it goes in to screensaver it seems to freeze up and takes a few minutes to come out of it, cant use menu or any icons.\nWas wondering if anyone has any idea if i am doing something wrong or should i change something??  TYAVMIA :-)\n\nA: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+bug/761865\n", "Q: Video performance on a Lenovo T520 is slow I have a new Lenovo t520 with 8gb memory and a i7 cpu. It's the first time I 'really' install Ubuntu on a pc. I have about six months of experience with Ubuntu as a guest OS on Windows in a VM.\nNow what is really annoying me is how slow the visuals are on my laptop. Mostly noticeable when I have to resize or move a window. Also when scrolling text in vim/browsers it's not really as smooth as I would like it.\nI read that Lenovo is using Optimus drivers for their new laptops and that these aren't supported. So I was wondering could using the integrated Intel gpu be the problem?\nThe CPU I have is the Core™ i7-2620M (2.70GHz, 4MB L3, 1333MHz FSB). I have tried to enable desktop effects but that didn't work.\n\nA: Have a look at the bumblebee solution in this page:\nhttps://launchpad.net/~hybrid-graphics-linux\nYou will be able to use both the intel card for the desktop and the nvidia card for specific applications. Check the google-chrome FPS values for benchmarking:\n\nsudo apt-get install git\n# type password\ngit clone http://github.com/MrMEEE/bumblebee.git\ncd bumblebee/\nsudo ./install.sh\noptirun glxgears\n# check the speed and compare to running:\nglxgears\n# If you have google-chrome installed, you can try it with/without optirun and report the FPS values on the mailing list:\noptirun google-chrome http://webglsamples.googlecode.com/hg/aquarium/aquarium.html\n\n\nA: The integrated GPU does indeed have worse performance compared to a discrete one. NVidia Optimus is completly unsupported in Ubuntu. If you're lucky, there might be a BIOS switch to switch between the discrete graphic card (nvidia) an the integrated GPU (i7).\n", "Q: the best way to edit a video MP4 file I have a Sony Bloggie camera that produces MP4 files. \nI want to edit them and upload them as fast as possible to youtube, in the best quality available.\nCurrently i'm using Kdenlive, that gives me a relative good output in .mpeg in HD 1280X720, but the rendering takes sometimes 4-5 hours for a 15 min clip edited project.\nIs there a better way? \nBTW, i'm on 10.04 on a dell Studio 1557.\n\nA: mp4's can be easily edited using both kdenlive and openshot.\nIf you use kdenlive you may be in the need to have KDE's theme properly configured in order to avoid problems with the menus and other program's items while at work.\nI personally prefer the usage of kdenlive.\nTranscoding can also be done inside of both these NLES. Or by following one of this suggestions: How can I maximum compress video files?\nScreenshots placed here for your convenience.\nkdenlive\n\nopenshot\n\nThe properties of the mp4 file that I used for this screenshots:\n\nGood luck!\n\nA: It can be a bit of a tradeoff between where you want to save time. Kdenlive is a perfectly respectable editor, if you were looking to try out alternatives then you could also try cinelerra or PiTiVi. Kino is useful for simple edits but can quickly get out of its depth.\nThe problem is that mp4 is a compressed format (hence it fits on the camera smart card), but that makes it harder to edit because your editing program has to do the work of decoding it. What you can do is convert your video file to a raw format like a .dv file or a DV encoded .avi which will make the rendering and editing much faster. The downsides however are that:\n\n\n*\n\n*raw video takes up huge amounts of space, expect an hour of SD video to be over 10GB, I don't know how big it will be for HD but its going to be bigger, and some programs don't like editing files that large.\n\n*you have to spend the extra time before and after editing, encoding the files. i.e. turning them from mp4 to raw, editing and then back from raw to mp4.\n\n\nMy main advice would be to try the approach above and play around with other formats, but I don't know how much time you'll actually save. While a 4-5 hour render is quite a while, once you take into account the time to encode at each and the huge increase in disk space needed to work with the files you might decide its not worth it.\n", "Q: Can Unity run smoothly on an HP Mini 210-1000 I own an HP Mini 210-1000, and I am aware that it meets the system requirements for the Unity shell.

When I have a lot of windows open, it's hard to read them in the taskbar because there's only room for a few characters of each window's title.\nHow can I increase the number of rows available, like in Windows?\n\nA: You just need to make the panel higher.

I don't like reaching for the tilde ~ key so often when I'm specifying file and program paths relative to the user home directory on the command line. Does anyone have any tips for cutting the number of keystrokes down?\n\nA: You cannot eliminate ~ completely, but at least there are some workarounds available.\nThese workarounds may not always be usable, but for other cases, it can be really helpful:\n\n\n*\n\n*Before doing the command, change your directory using cd (without arguments). This changes your working directory to ~.\n\n*If you frequently need to change the working directory to a folder within your home folder, use the CDPATH variable in bash. Run the next command to minimize cd ~/folder to cd folder, but still allow to change to a directory folder in the current directory if exist.\nCDPATH=.:~\n\nTo make this change persistent, add the line to ~/.bashrc. As its name may suggest, it only works for the cd command in bash.\n\n*Use the $HOME variable if you really want to avoid ~, in case the key would give you an electrical shock for example. This is especially useful in cases where tilde-expansion would not occur, between quotes for example (\"~\")\n\n*Create a function for a command. If you frequently need to copy files to a directory in your home directory as in cp file ~/archive, you can run the next code to create a function:\ncph(){ cp \"$1\" \"$HOME/$2\";}\n\nand use it as:\ncph file archive\n\nNote that you cannot pass arguments or multiple files to this function, that needs additional tweaking. As with the CDPATH hack, you can put it in your ~/.bashrc file to make it persistent.\n", "Q: Extra dash insertion when trying to run tar I have a really weird issue where I'm getting an extra - insertion on tar:\n# tar -zxvf mod_wsgi-3.3.tar.gz \n/bin/tar: unrecognized option '--zxvf'\nTry `tar --help' or `tar --usage' for more information.\n\nThe same issue happens if I try to do --help\n# tar --help\n/bin/tar: unrecognized option `---help'\nTry `tar --help' or `tar --usage' for more information.\n\nBut if I drop the first - both of the above examples work.

It's an odd issue, i installed Ubuntu 11.04 trough Wubi yesterday,it actually worked unlike the last time i tried to when it didn't boot at all.\nBut there is one thing that bugs me, see, i have 2 HDD's ,a 320GB one with Windows 7, and the other, a 500GB HDD with Ubuntu 10.10. \nI have partitioned the 500GB HDD, and contains a NTFS partition, and a EXT4 plus the Swap partitions.\nThe 320GB is not partitioned, as it only has Windows 7.\nSince i installed Wubi on Windows 7, when i have my Ubuntu drive connected, Wubi won't boot the installation, giving me a \"no wubdir\" error.\nHowever, if i phisically unplug the Ubuntu drive, then Wubi boots just fine.\nSo, how is the Ubuntu drive interfering with Wubi, to the extent of Wubi not even working when the drive is plugged?.\n\nA: Wubi uses grub4dos to boot (wubildr.mbr). The version of grub4dos is from around 2007 which is before ext4 was released. In any event, wubildr.mbr will hang whenever it encounters an ext4 partition.\nThe way it works is to search each partition (in BIOS order) for the file /wubildr (i.e. wubildr in the root of the partition). If it gets to the ext4 partition before it finds /wubildr, it will hang. So the solution is to copy /wubildr from your 320GB drive to the ntfs partitions on the 500GB drive, assuming it falls before the ext4 one - if not, the only way would be to add an entry to your other Ubuntu so that you can boot the Wubi install from there.\n\nA: you should be carefully to follow the instruction, where you download with Wubi, and download to complete, so you can where click and user, etcc, then done, click reboot with restart, then boost windows 7 and ubuntu, then click ubuntu, just leave waiting until appear ubuntu desktop, that's all. \n", "Q: linux-swap partition is in extended drive My apology if my question sounded silly, but I am very new to ubuntu.

However, I noticed that I have another partition called extended /dev/sda2 3.08G, and the linux-swap /dev/sda5 is under the extended partition as shown in gparted. May I know is the ubuntu installed correctly? I can only access to my main system partition, and have lost 6G. My harddisk is 80G and ram 1.5G. Thanks.\n\nA: Seems to be okay. The swap partition is used as virtual memory to extend your RAM. If you want u can remove it, but if you frequently max out your RAM you might wanna leave it. If you do remove it, its not a bad idea to delete its \"mount line\" in /etc/fstab (needs root privileges).\n\nA: If the swap partition is in extended, then you can't add them (2*3 = 6), but it is together 3G. And that's a reasonable amount, if you have 1.5 G real RAM. Or did I misunderstand? How big is the system partition? \nYou have to use the same tools, to take the measurements, since 80GB isn't 80GiB - often the numbers are intermixed, and then you get wrong results.\n", "Q: Can I slow the speed of the cursor on a laptop touchpad? The cursor is too jerky and moves too fast when I use the Touchpad on my laptop in ubuntu 11.04 beta 2.\nWhen I use Windows the cursor moves slowly and smoothly with precision. But on Ubuntu 11.04 Beta 2, the cursor is too fast and wobbly, imprecise.\nWhen using the touchpad, is there a way I can slow the cursor down and make it more smooth and precise?\nI'm using a Lenovo T410 laptop.\n\nA: \"sudo aptitude install synaptiks\"\nThis is the touchpad configuration tool in Ubuntu and works very well for me when I want to tweak touchpad settings.\n\n\nA: Press the windows key, type in \"mouse\".  You can play with the pointer speed settings and see if that helps.\n", "Q: Is there a process indicator for Unity? \nPossible Duplicate:\nWhat can replace system monitoring in the top Gnome Panel in Unity? \n\nHi!\nI have just upgraded to the 11.04 Ubuntu beta and am trying to get used to Unity. Seems good so far, but I really miss having the Gnome process monitor at the top panel. (Really useful when running long compilations/testing since it is usually enough to glance at it to see if everything is going as it should.)\nIs there any substitute in Unity?\n\nA: I'm not familiar with the gnome process monitor.  However I'm aware of the following application indicator which you can use display process usage of running applications.\nSince the developer of the ppa doesnt have a natty version I did the following to get the application to work\nsudo dpkg -i indicator-monitor_0.1.0-1_i386.deb\ncd /usr/lib\nsudo ln -s libappindicator.so.1.0.0 libappindicator.so.0\nsudo ln -s libdbus-glib-1.so.2.1.0 libdbus-glib-1.so.1\nsudo ln -s libdbusmenu-glib.so.3.0.14 libdbusmenu-glib.so.1\nindicator-monitor &\n\n\nA: There is no such thing, so far as I can see, but there is one way to get a somewhat more classic design of Ubuntu that will allow you to use one. Log out of your account. Click or enter your username (depending on whether you have hidden the user list or not) and then look at the bottom of the screen. There are 3 menus, and one of them probably says something like \"Ubuntu\" or \"Ubuntu Desktop\". Open this menu, and then click \"Ubuntu Desktop Classic\". (This may not be exactly what it says, but it's close) Now enter your password and log in. You will see a somewhat familiar Ubuntu desktop. ONE DIFFERENCE YOU DO NOT WANT TO MISS: The menus are integrated into the top panel like in Unity, but the title bar does not merge. Don't try and put the old tri-menu start button replacement in, because you will have menus from your open apps mixed in with them. (Example: Applications Places SystemFile Edit View Tools)\nOnce you have that, just use Ubuntu and the Gnome Panel like you would in 10.10. All of the options to add applets are still there.\nHope that is what you are looking for.\n\nA: After Jorge retagged my question as \"indicator\" I found the following page which lists some replacements for old applets:\nWhat Application Indicators are available?\nUnfortunately not all of them are available for natty yet, but at least I got a very basic system load monitor (indicator-sysmonitor) and a weather indicator (indicator-weather) working.\n", "Q: Can I boot straight into bash from a USB drive installation? I need to boot from a USB drive installation of Ubuntu 10.10 to do some maintenance on an older machine, and I don't feel like waiting for five minutes for the gnome to log me in. Is there a boot option that I can specify that will allow me to boot straight into bash?\n\nA: You can install to your usb the server edition iso without the graphical interface so you boot straight into console. \nFrom the normal ubuntu desktop booting iso in the begging you have 3 secs when you are show the icos keyboard and human. If you press any button you can execute commands on bottom to pass parameters.\n\nA: At the first textual menu, where you can choose to start ubuntu, check the disk or boot from first hard drive, press F6 for option, then ESC to dismiss the option menu.\nYou should see the boot options line, ending with two dashes.\nBefore the dashes, after quiet splash insert init=/bin/bash and press enter.\nAfter some errors, you should reach a shell prompt.\n\nA: I have never booted directly off of a usb chip, but it sounds like the same kind of thing as booting off a CD. At one point, there was a menu when you first start the cd with different options such as:\n\n\n*\n\n*Try Ubuntu without making changes to your computer\n\n*Install Ubuntu\n\n*Recover a Broken System\n\n*Etc.\n\n\nThis is still there, but you have to put in some input first. When you see the purple screen with the keyboard and accessibility icons, press an arrow key on your keyboard. This should give you that menu. Choose \"boot from first hard disk\" and you now boot from the HDD without removing the flash drive.\nHope this helps, your question was a bit confusing.\n", "Q: Firefox hidden cookies not in cookies.sql? When I access nadex.com quotes, Firebug tells me I send these cookies (but it's really all one line): \nJSESSIONID=Qk3lNyhpQCpGpfx4bghpJLd2ML90tNx3lKvpvPLcvdmJyGRGztH5!1308128606!-757\\\n827124; bhCookieSess=1; bhCookiePerm=1; IGFOREXCOOKIE=; LS__LSEngine_S=exist_13\\\n02897154477; LS__LSEngine_K=SHARE_SESSION; LS__https://demo-mdp.nadex.com=1; LS\\\n__LSEngine=73; iconStateSetting=/dealing/pd/cfd/login/loginUser.htm?iconsEnable\\\nd=true; homeUrl=https://demo.nadex.com/content/sites/ndx/en_US/; showDmaHelp=fa\\\nlse \n\nand Firefox's \"Edit/Preferences/Privacy/remove individual cookies\" \nseems to agree. \nHowever, when I look at cookies.sql, some cookies above don't show up: \ncp ~/.mozilla/firefox/xxxxxxxx.default/cookies.sqlite /tmp && \\\necho \"SELECT name FROM moz_cookies;\" | sqlite3 /tmp/cookies.sqlite |\\\nsort | uniq \n\n(note that I must \"cp\" since the original db is locked by Firefox). \nThe result's ugly + unhelpful, but I specifically noted these values \ndo NOT appear even though I'd expect them to: \n\n\n*\n\n*JSESSIONID (probably the most important one) \n\n*homeURL \n\n*showDmaHelp \n\n*possibly others \n\n\nHow can I find these \"hidden\" cookies? I'm writing a perl/curl script \nto download data, but it doesn't work w/o the JSESSIONID cookie (and \nhandcopying from Firebug isn't automatic enough, plus JSESSIONID \nchanges often) \nEDIT (too long/unwieldy for a comment): @Lekensteyn Thanks for the GM script! It doesn't update webappsstore.sqlite when I visit nadex.com and login, but it DOES update sessionstore.js, which contains:\n{\"host\":\"www.nadex.com\",\"value\":\"3x0LNpvGDHQq\\\nxls7FxbqtJ2pFlL0gSyk9YvBkPs09r4yvQyZDMWs!-1593496027!1301994507\",\"path\":\"/price\\\nstream\",\"name\":\"JSESSIONID\"}\n\nall on one line (in fact, the entire file is a single line).\nHowever, I haven't yet checked to see if that has anything to do w/ the GM script, or is something that happens anyway. At the very least, it gives me a new place to dig.\n\nA: I suspect that Firefox does not update the cookies.sqlite file directly for data integrity and performance reasons. Rather, it temporary stores the data in cookies.sqlite-journal (Firefox 3.x). Because the session cookies changes frequently, it is reasonable that the cookies are not present in the cookies.sqlite file. When Firefox is closed, the changes to cookies.sqlite are applied.\n\nA workaround is available using a Greasemonkey script.\n\n\n*\n\n*Install the Greasemonkey add-on.\n\n*Restart Firefox. Meanwhile, save the next text as \"jsessionid.user.js\".\n// ==UserScript==\n// @name           JSESSIONID to localStorage\n// @namespace      lekensteyn@gmail.com\n// @description    Saves the JSESSIONID cookie in localStorage\n// @include        https://demo.nadex.com/dealing/pd/cfd/security*\n// ==/UserScript==\n(function() {\n    var sessid = document.cookie.match(/JSESSIONID=([^;]+)/);\n    if (sessid) {\n        var oldSID = localStorage.JSESSIONID;\n        if (sessid != oldSID) localStorage.JSESSIONID = sessid[1];\n    }\n})();\n\nThis should retrieve the session cookie right after login and store using HTML5 Storage if the session ID is different than the previously saved one. If you need to make the script save the session ID earlier, you need to modify the @include line to something like https://demo.nadex.com/*. I've noticed that no session ID is sent over HTTP, just HTTPS.\n\n*Open the jsessionid.user.js file in Firefox (or drop it into Firefox). You'll be prompted on installing it. Accept it.\n\n*In Bash, use something like:\nsessid=$(sqlite3 ~/.mozilla/firefox/xxx.xxx/webappsstore.sqlite \"SELECT \\\n value FROM webappsstore2 WHERE key='JSESSIONID' AND secure='1' \\\n AND host LIKE 'moc.xedan.%' LIMIT 1;\")\n\nmoc.xedan. is a part of the domain in reverse order.\nFor debugging, you can use the next bookmarklet:\njavascript:alert(\"JSESSIONID=\" + localStorage.JSESSIONID);\n\nIt'll display null if there is no such ID found. Note that it matters whether you execute it on https://demo.nadex.com or http://demo.nadex.com. This bookmarklet can be pasted in the location bar directly.\n\nA: you can find your session id in the sessionstore.js in your profile. grep for:\n{\"host\":\"<your site>\",\"value\":\"(.+)\",\"path\":\"/\",\"name\":\"JSESSIONID\",\"httponly\":true}\n\nwith the appropriate value for  as shown in the FF cookie management window.\nIt could well be that this only works if you have activated the session restore mechanism in the properties.\n", "Q: What's the best chat client?

I upgraded to 11.4 beta (absolutely fantastic) on Asus EEE pc 1005ha.  I have a NTFS storage parition (/dev/sda4) visible by gparted.  However, I cannot access it via Ubuntu.  Any tips or ideas?\n\nA: Try \nsudo mount -t ntfs-3g /dev/sda4 \"some folder path\" \nto see if it mounts or not. See that package ntfs-3g is installed. If you wan't it to be mounted all the time you can use something like ntfs-config or enter mount point manually on /etc/fstab. See here for more information.\nSince it is visible in gparted it should be visible in Disk Utility as well. Try mounting from it as well.\n\nA: What sagarchalise suggested is also a way to mount the partition, but that would not mount the partition automatically upon each login (until you edit your fstab file), to mount the partition automatically, following are the steps you need to perform:\nNOTE: Following steps are intentionally written to be performed via GUI so that casual users can do it without any fear of Terminal. The Ubuntu help page does have same steps, but they are Terminal friendly.\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure the partition you want to auto-mount is NOT mounted currently.    \n\n\n*\n\n*Press Alt+F2 (Run Dialog) and write gksu nautilus.\n\n*Navigate to directory media from the Filesystem from the Nautilus sidepane.\n\n*Create a new directory and name it whatever you want, but avoid the use of any space or symbols in the name, a simple alpha-numeric name is recommended. Eg; Drive1.\n\n*Close Nautilus.\n\n\n*You can skip this step if already know on which device the partition is located (/dev/sda4 in your case) but those who don't know it can use following steps to identify the partitions.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Terminal from using short-cut Ctrl+Alt+T.\n\n*Enter command sudo blkid\n\n*the command will print the devices on which each partition is located, i.e. /dev/sdaX or /dev/sdbX where X will be a number unique for each partition, you'll also get other information like UID of each partition, its filesystem, etc.\n\n*Note the details and close Terminal.\n\n\n*Now again, open Run Dialog and enter gksu gedit /etc/fstab.\n\n\n*\n\n*This will open the fstab file in Text Editor with ROOT privileges.\n\n*Now append the following line at the end of the file, replacing sdaX with sda4 or anything else what you noted from Terminal when entering sudo blkid. And also replace MountPoint with the NAME of directory you created in /media directory for the partition you want to auto-mount.\n/dev/sdaX /media/MountPoint ntfs-3g rw,defaults 0 0\n\n*Now, save the file and close Text Editor.\n\n*Now, open Terminal and enter sudo mount -a.\n\n*Open Nautilus and check if the partition is now mounted.\nNow everytime you'll start Ubuntu, your partition will be auto-mounted (the way it does in Windows) with full read-write access. You can perform same steps to auto-mount all the partitions you have, but, keeping different names for mount points and appending their respective details in fstab file.\nI wonder if a any GUI utility exists for Ubuntu that can do exactly the same without touching Terminal or open fstab manually.\n", "Q: Why won't hp print driver print past a test page?

I have read through some of the Ubuntu documentation but am not clear on a good way to get backups of the system.  Obviously what I would like to do is be able restore the application data (and perhaps applications) if an issue occurs to the box. I would like the schedule the backup to run daily. \nWhat are (is) the recommended way to backup up an Ubuntu server?\nAm I able to direct backups to a network share where they will be put to tape?\nWhat is involved in restoring the data?    \n\nA: It really depends upon what your backup requirements are. Are you considering backup of entire machine, just userdata, perhaps app data, maybe mySQL data, etc?\nLinux admins commonly use tools like Rsync with combination or ssh, at times for added security to do file level backups. Of course, if you have a virtual environment, maybe you are backing up whole datastores.\nSo, maybe the question is are you considering file-level, and if so entire OS, or just some data directories? For typical data directories rsync+ssh is really commonly seen. When it comes to mySQL, there are countless scripts on the internet to dump that data into a file, and then again, using rsync+ssh to transfer that data. I personally am a fan of NFS, and all data remains on NFS, which just happens to be backed by a SAN. I use what I preach. I work for Nexenta, and use our SAN solution for all data, and backups. Backups in my case are done on the SAN, simply using snapshots and cloning.\n\nA: You say this is for LAMP applications (only?). In that case, you probably just need to backup the MySQL database(s), and the contents of /etc. The former should be backed up with a script specific to MySQL (backing up the MySQL data directory directly risks backing up an inconsistent database state), while for the latter, any technique can be used, even cp -a, because /etc is quite small.\nOK, a third thing to backup might be the applications themselves, but this is not so important because presumably you can just download them again if necessary.\n", "Q: ISO to USB || Ubuntu to Windows Trying to get a Windows 7 ISO to be written to a bootable USB from my Ubuntu installation, but it seems all the USB creators are for writing other Linux distributions, and the ones for Windows can only be RUN in Windows.

However to diagnose is difficult through askubuntu - a better forum based arena would I'm sure provide a more interactive question and answer type scenario to find an answer.  My advice is therefore more generic.\n\n*Since you have tried lapic as a boot option, what other options have you tried?  This link has some commonly used boot options that you may/may not have tried.enter link description here\n\n*Sometimes looking on your motherboard website there could be an updated bios update you could try.\n\n*Some people have perversely found that the 32bit ubuntu is better on a 64bit CPU and visa-versa.\n\n*Have a look in your BIOS options.  Sometimes, for whatever reason, ACPI is disabled.  If you have this option (or something like \"power management\") make sure it is enabled.\n\nA: Problem solved. Changed M/B for same model. All works fine.\n", "Q: Will the Nouveau driver continue to get updates? I installed Natty yesterday and it gave me the option to install \"Experimental 3D support for NVIDIA cards\" (which I'm assuming is Nouveau). Now, is there a PPA I will need to add to receive regular updates for the driver or will Canonical push updates out to me automatically?\n\nA: Unless there are security fixes or certain bug fixes specifically for the drivers in Ubuntu, it is unlikely that you will get regular updates of the Nouveau drivers.\nYou can read more about Stable Release Updates on the wiki but basically once a version is released it does not change much.\nNouveau is an open source graphics driver so there will be improved drivers each Ubuntu release. Nouveau's 3D support is rather new and there will definitely be performance improvements by the time Ubuntu 11.10 is released.\n", "Q: My folders have been synced but I don't see any files I recently signed up for a a 20 GB Ubuntu One account for 2.99 per month because I wanted to sync some of my Home folders.  It's been a week now.  My tomboy notes synced fine, but after selecting my Documents, Pictures, and Music folders to be synced I only see my folder names but no files when I go my Dashboard on the Ubuntu One site. \n\nA: Depending on what version of Ubuntu you're on, what you're seeing is normal. Folders get created first, and then files. Very slowly, if we're talking thousands of files.\nWe've worked on fixing this slowness and it should be much better by the time we release Natty, on Natty; older versions will get the speedups soon after that.\nMeanwhile, to make sure you are progressing, you can follow the instructions on How can I tell whether Ubuntu One file sync is working, and what progress it is making?\n", "Q: General Rules for dealing with File Permissions I have run into a ton of file permission issues in Ubuntu, from not having permission to delete a file, change the contents of a while, and so on. I was wondering if some of you Ubuntu experts could share how you generally deal with file permission issues? What are some general guidelines and terminal commands to keep in mind?\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: Every file on your system is owned by a user. Each user is a member of one or more groups. Using the chmod command a user can selectively allow self or others to read, write, or execute the file. Use of chmod is fairly complex, and you'll want to check out man chmod before proceeding, or perhaps http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chmod .\nEvery file that I expect to need to edit is in my Home directory, and belongs to me. \nThe only exception is the case of configuration files for system-wide things like Xorg or Samba. In general, new users probably shouldn't be editing these files by hand either, since other methods exist in most cases for adjusting those configurations.\nAfter restoring backups, you'll find sometimes that you don't have permission to edit your own files. This is because, for example, you have reinstalled Ubuntu. Even though you set up a user with the same name during the reinstall and are logged in as that user, your UID is different, so the system regards you as a different user- not the one who owns the files. This is fixed by using the chown command. As with chmod usage is complex, so read up on it first.\n Probably there is also a way to get Nautilus or some other command-line program to change file ownership also, but I don't know it. \nBE VERY CAREFUL when messing about with file ownership and permissions. You can cause great havoc this way.\n\nA: Everything in @koanhead's answer is absolutely right. But what you seems to be asking for is an easy way to face file permissions issues, this is very simple.\nIf you are using terminal, you can:\nman chmod and man chown\nin order to learn the appropiate usage of those commands. There are lots of stuff in the net, but you can be sure that the manuals in your system correspond to the command that you can use IN your system.\nFor a simple guide\nYou must have in consideration that you can change both file permissions and/or file owner by using both the commands I gave you above. The rules are simple:\nchown will change the owner of a file/folder. A folder's owner can be changed even recursively (by adding the -R option). This way:\nsudo chwon USERNAME ITEMNAME -R\n\nAfter which USERNAME will have full domain on ITEMNAME's contents (ITEMNAME can be a file or folder).\nIn order to do several tasks, and depending on the result that you expect. You can: sudo chmod 777 ITEMNAME -R in order to recursivelly allow everyone to perform any task over ITEMNAME, which can indeed be a file or folder. After that you can change the file/folder permissions in order to fit your needs.\nWhat I mean is that, if you wish to perform any task on your file/folder without restrictions, make it editable/writable/deletable for anyone (with 777 permissions) and go ahead. After that, make sure you restore the appropiate permissions to it.\nAdditional information on how to set proper permissions was dropped in a wiki link on @koanhead's answer.\nGood luck!\n", "Q: Is Nautilus elementary compatible?

Using 11.04. The network indicator is visible at all times, but this isn't necessary for me, it just adds clutter. Is there any way to hide/remove it?\nThanks!\n\nA: The simple answer is no, the indicators cannot be individually enabled or disabled, however you can kill the network indicator by running the following command: pkill nm-applet\nTo restart the network indicator, run nm-applet\nTo turn off the network indicator so it doesn't show up at all when you log in:\n\n\n*\n\n*Click the power icon in the top right corner and select System\nSettings.\n\n*Click Startup Applications in the Personal section.\n\n*Uncheck the Network Manager item.\n\n\nBe aware that killing the network indicator will not allow you to connect to wireless networks.\n", "Q: Delete a Directory  Consider this example.

Since user \"amathew\" no longer owns the directory, he does not have permission to delete it (unless there's a group relationship that's not specified here).\n\nA: You should also modify permissions to that file by:\nsudo chmod 777 FOLDERNAME -R\n\nThis way the file will be editable/deletable by anyone (which -of course- includes you).\nAfter that, try to delete and succeed.\nGood luck!\nGlossary:\nFOLDERNAME = change this for the folder name of your choice.\nJust for the record: If the user has already changed the ownership of the folder, he can now run this with no hassle.

Can I get it to switch to already open tab?\nDo any of the major browsers (Firefox, Chrome, Chromium, etc) have this feature?\n\nA: This can be done in Google Chrome by entering about:flags in the omnibox and scrolling to the very last item, \"Focus existing tab on open\". Click \"Enable\" and restart Chrome.\nNote: this feature is not documented for a reason. On the about:flags page it states:\n\n\"These experimental features may change, break, or disappear at any time. We make absolutely no guarantees about what may happen if you turn one of these experiments on, and your browser may even spontaneously combust.\"\n\nIn other words, you modify these settings at your own risk.\n\nA: This is a feature of Firefox 4.  If you start typing an already opened address, the drop-down menu will suggest switching to the already active tab pointing to that address.\nThere is an add-on for Firefox that will give you total keyboard control over the browser called \"Pentadactyl\" (here).  While not required, you'll probably enjoy it more if you already know vi keybindings.\nSo in fact, there is a way to change tabs with a \"terminal\" (ok, not really a terminal).  But Pentadactyl supports the following commands:\n:tabnext\n:tabprevious\n:tablast\nand several others.\n", "Q: Music player incorrectly identifies downloaded music as \"streaming\" I am playing some music that I got from youtube.

Try transcoding and see what happen. \nThis behavior usually happens (but not limits to) when the audio inside of the file is using a variable bit rate (VBR) for the playback. So I suggest you to use a Constant Bit Rate (CBR) for the transcodification.\n128 kbps will be good enough for the majority of the music genres. But if you are more exigent on the sounds that your compressed files delivers, try using 196~256 kbps CBR.\nPlease inform of your results in order to check if we can have a better answer.\nGood luck!\nP.S.

Last time I checked it doesn't yet support Xrandr 1.2, which is the part of the display server that does the magic you're after (activate monitor automatically when connected).\nYou might want to try the open source radeon driver available, which is called xserver-xorg-video-radeon (find it through Synaptic). As stated here: http://wiki.x.org/wiki/RadeonFeature the R600-series (your HD 3450) should be working with xrandr1.2.\nThis will be a trade-off between performance and better multimonitor support.

My computer is detecting the sound card and there are no problems with my speakers.This maybe a bug but I cannot file a report as I don't have enough information.\n\nA: I have had similar experiences.  Audio worked fine and then during my login session it stopped.  I found a few interesting facts about this.  First I removed the .esd_auth ,pulse-cookie and .pulse directories.  Then I rebooted and audio can back.  That lasted a while and it happened again.  Now I find that simply logging off and on 2 or 3 times resets the audio for a while.  Sorry this is not a solution, but might help.\nTry to determine what \"dot\" directories in your home directory are audio related and see if they are culrpit.  Easiest way to tell?  Create a brand new account and log into it.  If audio works then the problem is in your configuration and not the system.  Look at the dot files and directories in the new account, one of them (or more) deals with audio and you can replace your directory/files with the ones from the new and working account.\n", "Q: Can't find external CD/DVD in Virtual Box/Windows XP mode? \nPossible Duplicate:\nSet up USB for Virtualbox \n\nIf this is the wrong forum I apologize.

By default, all virtual machines are created with only one CD driver.\nBut you can assign any of your real drives to this one, even just iso images.

My Internet gets paused sometimes because of change in the 3g signal strength and I've to restart the whole apt-get update process again! Each update consumes 13-15 mb and every mb costs here!! Can I do something to pause the update so that I can resume it after I connect my Internet again!\np.s - I know that I can resume downloads of apps/upgrade\n\nA: First pause that job.\nto pause a job : \nCtrl + z \n\nfor restarting the job again when you get the network signals :\nfor running it in foreground, use\nfg %1 \n\nfor running it in background, use\n bg %1 \n\n\nA: You can stop the downloading of packages or updating of the system, by pressing \"Ctrl+C\" and stopping the program. This will stop the program completely. The next time you try the same command, apt-get will resume downloading from the point where it stopped last time\n\nA: As my aptitude told me after unexpected reboot, use:\nsudo dpkg --configure -a\n\nAnd as man dpkg explains:\n\nIf -a or --pending is given instead of package, all unpacked but unconfigured packages are configured.\n\n\nA: Looking at the recommendations for using Ctrl+C, I think it'd be better to try Ctrl+Z to suspend the process in the background when/if the network drops.  You might be able to use fg to resume once your connectivity returns.  (I don't know how robust apt-get is in this scenario, though.)\nAnother possibility would be using axel and the apt-fast script.   It is advertised as speeding up downloads by doing parallel downloads, but it also seems to be good about keeping track of what's already been downloaded, presumably because it has to track the file pieces as it downloads in parallel chunks.\nHere's the original thread from Ubuntuforum.\n\nA: Installing/Updating is an atomic operation. Either it completes, or it doesn't. If the update breaks/stops then it rollbacks to the last point before update began. Because the headers (files that contain data of packages, and where to fetch them from) The packages however, begin downloading from the point that your connection broke off. Just a word of advice, dont interrupt an install, chances are that it will make the system unusable.\n\nA: I dont like terminal. Neither know whether it is possible using terminal or not. But there is a bad way of doing what you have asked. For this you need \"Synaptic Package Manager\". If you don’t have this then first install it. Now if you have it then, open it; Click on \"Mark All Upgrades\". This will bring up all the upgradable (updatable) packages. Now start downloading packages until your connection is lost. If the connection is lost, Synaptic will complain about it and stop upgrading. No worries, close synaptic package manager. (Do not open Software centre or use apt-get through command line until up-gradation is finished.)\nNow after reconnecting, start synaptic again. And again click on \"Mark all Upgrades\" and start updating. This time you will see, only those packages which were failed to download, are getting downloaded and others are skipped.\nThis is not a good solution, but it works.

I had installed Ubuntu inside Windows XP but then I formatted XP and installed Windows 7. \nEDIT1: I used Wubi for the same.\nI want to know which one of the two will solve my problem? creating a virtual disk or resizing root? Also is resizing root possible as the 4GB ext4 partition is already in a NTFS format Hard Drive partition.\nAt the time of installation I had allocated only 4GB of space to Ubuntu. I want to increase that size as I keep getting a low disk space notification. \nI have surfed through a lot of similar questions but this is not a duplicate.\nBecause I want to know a little about the file systems. In order to solve my problem,do I have to increase the size of root.disk? Or will it be solved by creating a virtual disk?\nAlso I want to know the difference between creating a virtual disk and just increasing disk space of root.I'm new to Ubuntu so I don't know how the file systems function.\nEDIT2:I have created a virtual disk of 10gb ,but I'm still getting the same notification.Is there anyway to install all further applications on the virtual disk I created?\n\nA: Additional virtual disks are only useful if you're able to split the filesystem (eg putting /home/ on it) so aren't much use if you've installed a ton of stuff. You can split things like /usr/bin but it can get really messy, really fast.\nHave you not seen a link to this post on your travels? You'll need a LiveCD or LiveUSB to action it, but it's very simple once you're at that point. Here are the main points:\n\n\n*\n\n*mount your windows partition (where the Wubi install sits)\n\n*fsck the Wubi filesystem to make sure it's okay. If you don't do this and it has corruption in it before resizing, bad things can happen.\n\n*resize2fs the Wubi filesystem to increase its size.\n\n*Have a snack, chill out, high-five yourself... You've just increased the partition size.\n\n\nThose aren't the full commands, I'll leave those in that thread because it seems to be well maintained.\nFailing that, installing Ubuntu only takes a few minutes. If you like it, perhaps you should consider a proper install (disk performance is better too).\n\nA: It's hard to tell here whether you are referring to virtualization or simply the Wubi installer.\nAssuming the former, first increase the size of the virtual disk, since that will allow us to expand the actual partition.\nThen mount the LiveCD in the Virtual Machine and run gparted. Using that tool, resize the partition to take up the remaining space you created when you expanded the disk. Now reboot and unmount the CD.\n\nA: You actually don't have to boot from a livecd to do this:\nsudo dd if=/dev/zero bs=1MiB of=/host/ubuntu/disks/root.disk conv=notrunc oflag=append count=2048\nsudo losetup -c /dev/loop0\nsudo resize2fs /dev/loop0\n\nThis will add 2 GiB to the filesystem.  Adjust the count=2048 for different sizes.\n\nA: Of course it is too late but helpful for new comer\nInstall 14.04 Ubuntu via WUBI in windows 8. I have done these steps:\nDownload the iso from Ubuntu site.\nmount it in a virtual drive in windows and copy all files in a drives folder.\nFrom the folder click the exe to run WUBI setup. Which runs same as 10.x Ubuntu.\nIn 5 to 10 min it ask to restart, I have a issue of ro (read only) so convert it to rw(read and write) as show here Describe Here\nAbove part is for installing..\nTo extend the WUBI root.disk is a way. \nI have found solution here\nyou need to download a zip from link this.\nExtract it and just run the one line command and this will done all job\nsudo bash wubi-resize.sh 10\n\nAbove commad will done following job:\nCreate a disk(Virtual) with desired (10GB) size in drive. \nCopy all data from you running disk to newly created disk\nand ask you to boot Windows and rename root.disk to OLDroot.disk and new.disk (New drive)\nto root.disk and reboot again Ubuntu.

What is the difference between ssh -Y (trusted X11 forwarding) and ssh -X (untrusted X11 forwarding)? As far as I have understood it, it has something to do with security, but I did not grasp the difference and when to use which.\n\nA: Use neither when you don't need to run X11 programs remotely; use -X when you do; and hypothetically use -Y if an X11 program you care about works better with -Y than with -X.  But currently (Ubuntu 15.10), -X is identical to -Y, unless you edit ssh_config to say ForwardX11Trusted no.  -X was originally intended to enable the X Security extension of the 1990's, but that is old and inflexible, and crashes some programs, and so is ignored by default.\nBoth ssh -Y and -X let you run an X11 program on a remote machine, with its windows appearing on the local X monitor.  The issue is what the program is allowed to do to other programs' windows, and to the X server itself.\nlocal$ ssh -X remote\nremote$ xlogo\n# Runs xlogo on remote, but the logo pops up on the local screen.\n\nTrusted X11 forwarding is enabled by -Y.  This is the historical behavior.  A program with access to the display, is trusted with access to the entire display.  It can screenshot, keylog, and inject input into all the windows of other programs.  And it can use all X server extensions, including ones like accelerated graphics, which are security exposures.  Which is good for running smoothly, but bad for security.  You are trusting the remote programs to be as safe as your local programs.\nUntrusted X11 forwarding tries to restrict remote programs to accessing only their own windows, and to using only those parts of X which are relatively secure.  Which sounds good, but currently doesn't work well in practice.\nThe meaning of -X currently depends on your ssh configuration.\nOn Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, unless you edit your ssh_config, there is no difference between -X and -Y.  \"[B]ecause too many programs currently crash in [untrusted] mode.\"\nubuntu1404$ man ssh\n...\n -X      Enables X11 forwarding.  This can also be specified on a per-host\n         basis in a configuration file.\n         ...\n         (Debian-specific: X11 forwarding is not subjected to X11 SECURITY\n         extension restrictions by default, because too many programs cur‐\n         rently crash in this mode.  Set the ForwardX11Trusted option to\n         “no” to restore the upstream behavior.  This may change in\n         future depending on client-side improvements.)\n\nubuntu1404$ grep ForwardX11Trusted /etc/ssh/ssh_config\n#   ForwardX11Trusted yes\n\nIf ForwardX11Trusted no, then -X enables untrusted forwarding.  Otherwise, -X is treated the same as -Y, trusting that remote programs with display access are friendly.\n\nA: The -X option enables X11 forwarding:\n-X   Enables X11 forwarding.  This can also be specified on a per-host\n     basis in a configuration file.\n\n     X11 forwarding should be enabled with caution.  Users with the\n     ability to bypass file permissions on the remote host (for the\n     user's X authorization database) can access the local X11 display\n     through the forwarded connection.  An attacker may then be able\n     to perform activities such as keystroke monitoring.\n\n     For this reason, X11 forwarding is subjected to X11 SECURITY\n     extension restrictions by default.  Please refer to the ssh -Y\n     option and the ForwardX11Trusted directive in ssh_config(5) for\n     more information.\n\nThe option -Y, corresponding to the ForwardX11Trusted directive in ssh_config(5), is even less secure because, it removes X11 SECURITY extension controls.\n-Y      Enables trusted X11 forwarding.  Trusted X11 forwardings are not\n        subjected to the X11 SECURITY extension controls.\n\nIt's more secure to use -x\n-x   Disables X11 forwarding.\n\n\nA: Both options have something to do with X11 forwarding. This means if you enable this, you can use a graphical client through your SSH session (e.g., use Firefox or something else).\nIf you use ssh -X remotemachine the remote machine is treated as an untrusted client. So your local client sends a command to the remote machine and receives the graphical output. If your command violates some security settings you'll receive an error instead.\nBut if you use ssh -Y remotemachine the remote machine is treated as a trusted client. This last option can open security problems. Because other graphical (X11) clients could sniff data from the remote machine (make screenshots, do keylogging and other nasty stuff) and it is even possible to alter those data.\nIf you want to know more about those things, I suggest reading the Xsecurity manpage or the X Security extension spec. Furthermore, you can check the options ForwardX11 and ForwardX11Trusted in your /etc/ssh/ssh_config.\n\nA: from man:\nDebian-specific:\nIn the default configuration:                                 ForwardX11Trusted  yes\n-Y   is equivalent to -X   ( I think this describtion is better:  -X is as easy to use as -Y,  but with same risks)\n\nuntrusted does not mean that machine is more dangerous than trusted machine, but means you are cautious, so safer.\n", "Q: Is it possible to install on a CRT based iMac (the large, fat, old ones) I have a very old mac from a very long time ago, it looks like this: \nI don't know if this is the exact model but it is the exact color\nMy question is: is it of any possibility that I install a modern version of ubuntu onto it\nPS...

After installing the ubuntu-restricted-extras package, one of the options that shows up in Rhythmbox's preferences under \"preferred format\" is \"CD Quality MP3,\" but from the encoder options it appears that it uses a constant bitrate. \nI'd like to set up an Audio Profile to encode at a variable bitrate (VBR) at a reasonably high quality. What options do I need to use under \"gstreamer pipeline?\" Or alternatively, is there a more discoverable way to enter encoding options than entering command-line options into Rhythmbox?\n\nA: Just so we're talking on the same page, the pipeline used by this encoding target looks like the following on my system:\naudio/x-raw-int,rate=44100,channels=2 ! lamemp3enc name=enc target=0 quality=6 ! xingmux ! id3v2mux\n\nYou can learn about each of the elements in the pipeline with the gst-inspect-0.10 tool.  For example, to learn about the MP3 encoder used here, you could run:\ngst-inspect-0.10 lamemp3enc\n\nAmong other things, this will tell you about the various properties supported by the element and their defaults.  This tells me:\n\n\n*\n\n*encode using variable bit rate (cbr=false from defaults)\n\n*the encoder has been set to optimise for quality rather than a target bitrate (target=0)\n\n*uses a VBR quality setting of 6 (quality=6)\n\n*uses the standard quality of the LAME engine (encoding-engine-quality=standard from defaults)\n\n\nSo you should already be getting VBR output from that pipeline.  If you want higher quality, lower the 'quality=' number (0-10, 0 is the highest quality) and perhaps add encoding-engine-quality=high.\n", "Q: What Internet bandwidth speed tools are available?

It's very useful and I can tweak this for my own need. I see nautilus has the same feature, but I don't know how to tweak this (for example, add or remove extra options). Is there any way to do this?\nI have tweaked \"Send to\" options in windows explorer. See the screenshot below:\n\n\nA: Yes you can tweak Nautilus.\nYou can put scripts at the folder ~/.gnome2/nautilus-scripts/ and you will see then when you right click on a file or a folder. At G-scripts you will find some instructions and examples.  \nR Srijith has made a send to script that you can begin with. \n\nA: Your response is -> Nautilus Actions (since 19.10+ filemanager-actions). So type in terminal the following line:\nsudo apt-get install nautilus-actions\n\nthen search for nautilus-actions tutorial. There are just 2 or 3 easy steps to learn how to use this strong tool.\nPractically you can do exactly what you want. You can add some contextual menu entries for Nautilus right-click and you can map different actions. Some actions are ready made on Internet most of them are here.\n\nA: To answer the original question directly : \nNo the average person can not easily edit or customise the Send To context menu in nautilus.\nThe reason is that those entries are actually Plugins to the nautilus-sendto program, which are stored on your computers filesystem as .so files (similar to windows .dll).\nSo there you have it, it's not easy for the non programmer to create .so files.\nIn my humble opinion the send-to context menu should build its menu based on .desktop files in ~/.local/share/send-to/shortcuts/* and bash/python/etc scripts in ~/.local/share/send-to/plugins/*\nBut gnome developers aren't known for their ability to relate to the common person.\n", "Q: Using humanity system icons for created application Are there any legal issues with publishing and sharing an application that loads a humanity system icon as default .desktop?\n\nA: disclaimer: I am not a lawyer\nAn excerpt from /usr/share/doc/humanity-icon-theme/copyright:\nLicense:\n\nThe Humanity Icon Theme is licensed under the GPL v2.\n\nParts of the work are based on the Tango icons, which are released under the\npublic domain.\n\nSo, the work uses the GPL version 2 license. AFAIK, this means that you can use it freely providing you've put a note in your program that you're using the Humanity Icon Theme which use the GPLv2 license.\n\nA: disclaimer: I am not a lawyer either\nIn a .desktop file you only reference the icon you are using. This means you are not copying or redistributing the icon so you can legally redistribute the application, even if it is under an incompatible licence.\nIf you copy or redistribute the icon, you need to adhere to the GPL v2 as Lekensteyn has said. Howeverh, as far as I know, the GPL requires no attribution, so you don't need to say you are using the Humanity Icon Theme.\nYou should note that if you merely reference the icon from the Humanity icon theme, this will require users to have the theme installed for it to show properly. You can solve this issue by distributing this icon as part of your application, storing it in /usr/share/pixmaps on installation then referencing it by name. For example, if your application was called 'my-app', you could install the icon to /usr/share/pixmaps/my-app.png and  in your .desktop file you could put Icon=my-app. This would require you to abide by the GPL.\nEven if your application is closed source, you could potentially distribute it as two packages - a closed source application package and a free icon package. However, I'm not entirely sure of how this would work legally.\n", "Q: Applications Not Showing Up in Unity This has happened a couple of times now, the unity menu (when you click on the Ubuntu logo) has all the categories there but when you click on say media apps it will be blank the same for the other options as well. searching for something will also draw a blank =/\nany help?\nUsing Ubuntu 11.04 Beta 2 32bit\n\nA: This seems like a bug.

To present it visually nice I would like to add separators (white lines as seen in the screenshot) to separate that from the other existing commands.\nIs there any code or any other way to do this?\nHow do I add a separator to the quicklists in unity?\n\nA: You can put your own separator with em-dash characters buts its not an \"Official\" separator as per Jorge Castro's answer,and, will have a slightly different look.  Insert a shortcut group for the separator. For example:\n[sep Shortcut Group]\nName=———————————\nTargetEnvironment=Unity\n\nNote that I named my separator group \"sep\" so you need to place \"sep\" (wthout quotes) into the \"Ayatana-Desktop-Shortcuts=...\"\nExample:\nX-Ayatana-Desktop-Shortcuts=Home;Desktop;Documents;Music;Pictures;sep;Win\n\nThis will place a separator below my Pictures shortcut and above my Win shortcut.\nWith gedit, the emdash is achieved by pressing Ctrl-Shift+U2014 (Use keypad & ensure num-lock is ON).  It is then easier to clipboard copy this character & then pasting it (using Ctrl-V) multiple times. (9 or 10 of these is good enough).\nAlso, you may notice that the \"sep\" shortcut group has no need for an Exec= line as there is no need to execute anything.\n", "Q: Using gnome-open to open pdf files I configured evince to be my default application to open pdf files (using Open with... and clicking on always opening pdf files with this application), but when I type gnome-open foo.pdf instead of evince, I have Nautilus that opens up in the correct folder highlighting the file of my choice. \nThis is especially disturbing since I am using the LaTeX plugin for gedit, and when I try and compile a tex file to pdf, instead of opening up a new window with my compiled pdf file, I just have nautilus pop-up.\nI know I can edit the scripts of my gedit LaTeX plugin to call on evince (or acroread) with the pdf I want opened, but this is a workaround and not the solution I am looking for.\n\nA: Forth Approach \nI could reproduce your problem by deleting this file /usr/share/applications/evince.desktop, so make sure you have this file.  \nReference.\nThird Approach \nxdg-open appears to use the configuration of /etc/mailcap. So edit it to associate pdf with evince.  \ngksu gedit /etc/mailcap  \n\nLook for the lines that begin with application/pdf; application/x-pdf; application/x-bzpdf; application/x-gzpdf. They should look like this to associate pdf with evince:  \napplication/pdf; evince '%s'; test=test -n \"$DISPLAY\"; nametemplate=%s.pdf\napplication/x-pdf; evince '%s'; test=test -n \"$DISPLAY\"; nametemplate=%s.pdf\napplication/x-bzpdf; evince '%s'; test=test -n \"$DISPLAY\"; nametemplate=%s.pdf.bz2\napplication/x-gzpdf; evince '%s'; test=test -n \"$DISPLAY\"; nametemplate=%s.pdf.gz\n\nReference.\nSecond Approach \nWhat is the output of  \nxdg-mime query filetype foo.pdf  \n\nIf the output isn't what we should expect, then:  \nxdg-mime default evince.desktop application/pdf   \n\nReference. \nFirst Approach \nThere are other places that the file associations are set.\nYou may change the files associations at:\n/usr/share/applications/defaults.list \n/usr/share/applications/mimeinfo.cache\n~/.local/share/applications/  \n~/.gnome/share/apps/ \n\nLook for \"pdf\" and for \"Nautilus\" inside theses files.  \n\nA: I just ran into this problem today, and according to this thread on ubuntuforums.org, it's caused by exo-utils:\nhttp://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1729680\nexo-tools is a dependency of Thunar (which I installed today), but isn't normally installed in stock Ubuntu, which I guess is why they missed this bug in release.\nRemoving this packaged (I actually just removed Thunar and all it's deps) fixed the problem for me.\n\nA: The problem is related to exo-utils.\n\n\n*\n\n*there is a bug, which has been fixed for Ubuntu Utopic: https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/956255\n\n*for some reason, the following x-scheme-handler lines got copied/sticked in ~/.local/share/applications/mimeapps.list\n\n    % grep exo ~/.local/share/applications/mimeapps.list \n    x-scheme-handler/file=exo-file-manager.desktop\n    x-scheme-handler/trash=exo-file-manager.desktop\n\nThis caused xdg-open/gvfs-open to use /usr/share/applications/exo-file-manager.desktop, which contains:\nExec=exo-open --launch FileManager %u\n\nThis is the reason that even with the fixed package, it still opened Nautilus for every file.\n\nA: Removing exo-utils worked for me perfectly.\n\nA: The problem is coming from thunar and exo-utils (which is needed by thunar). Removing them solves the problem.\n\nA: I had a similar issue, removing exo-utils did not work for me.\nAfter a little digging I found two entries for application/pdf in /etc/mailcap that were prioritizing Xpdf over evince. \nAfter commenting out the two entries for Xpdf, xdg-open correctly opens pdf documents with evince. \n\nA: I had the same problem after installing nautilus to manage my files under Xubuntu 11.10. When I moved back to plain Ubuntu 12.04 the problem was there too.\nSimple solution if this happens ONLY to your user (close to what desgua already said): delete ~/.local/share/applications directory and everything should go back to normal. You may want to backup some shortcuts inside that directory if you want to preserve them.\n\nA: Working fine for me, gnome-open opens up Adobe Reader properly.\nCould you try with Adobe reader once.\nMight be the case that evince is not properly set as default somewhere.\nI am using Natty BTW.\n", "Q: Splitting an MP4 file What is the fastest and least resource consuming method for splitting an MP4 file?\nI tried ffmpeg but got an error:\n$ ffmpeg -vcodec copy -ss 0 -t 00:10:00 -i /home/asafche/Videos/myVideos/MAH00124.MP4 /home/asafche/Videos/myVideos/eh.mp4\nFFmpeg version SVN-r0.5.1-4:0.5.1-1ubuntu1.1, Copyright (c) 2000-2009 Fabrice Bellard, et al.\nconfiguration: --extra-version=4:0.5.1-1ubuntu1.1 --prefix=/usr --enable-avfilter --enable-avfilter-lavf --enable-vdpau --enable-bzlib --enable-libgsm --enable-libschroedinger --enable-libspeex --enable-libtheora --enable-libvorbis --enable-pthreads --enable-zlib --disable-stripping --disable-vhook --enable-runtime-cpudetect --enable-gpl --enable-postproc --enable-swscale --enable-x11grab --enable-libdc1394 --enable-shared --disable-static\n  libavutil     49.15. 0 / 49.15. 0\n  libavcodec    52.20. 1 / 52.20. 1\n  libavformat   52.31. 0 / 52.31. 0\n  libavdevice   52. 1. 0 / 52. 1. 0\n  libavfilter    0. 4. 0 /  0. 4. 0\n  libswscale     0. 7. 1 /  0. 7. 1\n  libpostproc   51. 2. 0 / 51. 2. 0\n  built on Mar 31 2011 18:53:20, gcc: 4.4.3\n\nSeems stream 0 codec frame rate differs from container frame rate: 119.88 (120000/1001) -> 59.94 (60000/1001)\nInput #0, mov,mp4,m4a,3gp,3g2,mj2, from '/home/asafche/Videos/myVideos/MAH00124.MP4':\n  Duration: 00:15:35.96, start: 0.000000, bitrate: 5664 kb/s\n    Stream #0.0(und): Video: h264, yuv420p, 1280x720, 59.94 tbr, 59.94 tbn, 119.88 tbc\n    Stream #0.1(und): Audio: aac, 48000 Hz, stereo, s16\nOutput #0, mp4, to '/home/asafche/Videos/myVideos/eh.mp4':\n    Stream #0.0(und): Video: libx264, yuv420p, 1280x720, q=2-31, 90k tbn, 59.94 tbc\n    Stream #0.1(und): Audio: 0x0000, 48000 Hz, stereo, s16, 64 kb/s\nStream mapping:\n  Stream #0.0 -> #0.0\n  Stream #0.1 -> #0.1\nUnsupported codec for output stream #0.1\n\nWhat am I doing wrong and how do I properly split an mp4 file?\n\nA: With ffmpeg you can split file using the following command:\nffmpeg -i ORIGINALFILE.mp4 -acodec copy -vcodec copy -ss START -t LENGTH OUTFILE.mp4\n\nwhere START is starting positing in seconds or in format hh:mm:ss\nLENGTH is the chunk length in seconds or in format hh:mm:ss\nSo you will need to run this command few times depending on how long your video. If let's say your video is 31 minutes long and you want so split into 15 min chunks here is how you run it:\nffmpeg -i ORIGINALFILE.mp4 -acodec copy -vcodec copy -ss 0 -t 00:15:00 OUTFILE-1.mp4\nffmpeg -i ORIGINALFILE.mp4 -acodec copy -vcodec copy -ss 00:15:00 -t 00:15:00 OUTFILE-2.mp4\nffmpeg -i ORIGINALFILE.mp4 -acodec copy -vcodec copy -ss 00:30:00 -t 00:15:00 OUTFILE-3.mp4\n\nThere is a python script that you can use that does this automatically(i.e. takes video file, chunk size in seconds and generates individual playable video files): https://github.com/c0decracker/video-splitter\n\nA: Not sure what your need is, but you can type this in a terminal: To open a terminal, press Ctrl + Alt + T\nsplit -b 4M file.mp4 part_file\nThis will split the files into chunks of 4 megabytes. TO recreate the file again, type\ncat part_file[a-c] > file.mp4\nNotice that i have typed a-cin the bracket, because the split created 3 files.  in your case you might have to see more. I will explain with an example.\n$ ls -lh\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root        root        9.3M 2011-04-17 20:09 file.mp4\n\nThis shows that I have a single file, of 9.3 MB. To split, I type:\n$ split -b 2M file.mp4 part_file\n\nAfter splitting, I get the files as:\n$ ls -lh\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root        root        9.3M 2011-04-17 20:09 file.mp4\n-rw-r--r-- 1 thetuxracer thetuxracer 2.0M 2011-04-17 20:12 part_fileaa\n-rw-r--r-- 1 thetuxracer thetuxracer 2.0M 2011-04-17 20:12 part_fileab\n-rw-r--r-- 1 thetuxracer thetuxracer 2.0M 2011-04-17 20:12 part_fileac\n-rw-r--r-- 1 thetuxracer thetuxracer 2.0M 2011-04-17 20:12 part_filead\n-rw-r--r-- 1 thetuxracer thetuxracer 1.3M 2011-04-17 20:12 part_fileae\n\nNotice the two characters appended to the filename.\nTo get the file back:\n$ cat part_filename[start-end][start-end] > file.mp4\n\n\nA: I thought it may be helpful to go beyond the original question of \"how do I properly split an mp4 file?\" by pointing out how to do it efficiently. For a large video, it may be especially helpful, as I found out on a 13.7 GB file when following Alex's answer above. \nThe trick is to use the -ss option before the -i so that ffmpeg skips over the specified time in the input instead of seeking through it. See the ffmpeg documentation https://www.ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg.html#Main-options for more details, but the relevant explanation is: \n-ss position (input/output)\nWhen used as an input option (before -i), seeks in this input file to position. \n...\nWhen used as an output option (before an output url), decodes but discards input until the timestamps reach position.\n\n\nA: If you prefer using a gui there is avidemux available in the repositories. Defining the cut points is much easier this way !\nThe selection markers define the part of the video that will be exported, using \"copy\" in audio and video avoids reencoding. You can also choose the container or change it (avi, mp4, mkv, etc).\nI've done a bunch of cuts on some videos from a camera and it was instantaneous !\n\nA: Use mkvmerge from the mkvtoolnix package. Use something like\nmkvmerge -o outputprefix --split 1G origfile.mp4\n\nThis would split your file in 1 GB blocks. You can use time-indications as well.\n\nA: The easiest and foolproof method is to use MP4Box:\n\n\n*\n\n*# apt install gpac\n\n*$ MP4Box -split 15 /home/asafche/Videos/myVideos/MAH00124.MP4 (the parameter is time in seconds). For other split possibilities, for example by size see https://gpac.wp.imt.fr/mp4box/mp4box-documentation/ or MP4Box -h general\nConcatenation is similarly simple.\n\nA: If this is an MP4 part 2, then with a very meticulous approach, you can proceed the file without encoder/decoder. This answer is intended for people with a programming background and an hex editor that want to keep the file \"\"intact\"\".\nThe first part of the file is a mdat, the second is a moov, containing metadata used by the decoder to locate chunks, which contain samples (encoded images and sound, not important to know). Then there are STCO, STTS, STSC, etc. This is called \"atoms\". They indicate what are the offset, length, etc, of each of the chunks. If you do a clean job, you can make several instances of your video, and different version with different chunks. The file will then be playable in players, and digested on video websites. If you're a coder, then build an MP4 parser or use an existing one to keep track of the parts and their offsets. That will help you to know more about the format, and to rebuild files automatically.\n\nA: Another open-source GUI tool, that can split videos, and do much more, is handbrake\nFor example, here I'm splitting my video on 24.53 (mm:ss), and also cropping the frame on the right side:\n\nYou can see the preview of the output easily - with the \"Preview\" button.\n", "Q: Test Automatic Connectivity I tried Test Automatic Connectivity on 11.04 beta 2 and as I try to follow these instructions:\nUsing Unity\n\n\n*\n\n*Ensure that NetworkManager is running (computer icon in the notification area) and that no networks are currently connected.\n\n*Click on Ubuntu Logo and search Terminal.\n\n*In the terminal, run ifconfig.

I obviously have more than just \"lo\". What's the deal with this?\n\nA: The command ifconfig lists every networking device it finds. So usually the lo-device exists on every computer and you will at least see this. However many computers have a networking card and this is configured at system start. So you see two devices in that case. The name eth0 means ethernet card number 0.\nThe description above now activates your wireless card. So you see a device called wlan0. On some computers (or with some wireless cards) this name can also be like eth1 or so. The command ifconfig shows you that there are now two (eth0, lo) or three (eth0, wlan0, lo) configured interfaces. Your computer transferred some bytes (see RX bytes and TX bytes) with your wireless card.\nHowever the command ifconfig lists every networking device it is aware of. So in your case it seems quite natural that it shows also the networking card which is probably built into your computer.\n", "Q: Command line calculator that keeps fractional values I just found a good command line calculator program called bc and was satisfied with it until I discovered it rounds off fractional values, thus causing loss in precision.\nAccording to its man page:\n\nAll numbers are represented\n  internally in decimal and\n         all computation is done in decimal.

I see a lot of interesting programs out there that can only be obtained by adding a \"PPA\" to the system but, if I'm understanding correctly, we should stay within the official \"repositories\" for adding software to our system. \nIs there any way for a novice to know if a \"PPA\" is safe or if it should be avoided? What tips should the user know about when dealing with a PPA?.\n\nA: The packages on PPA's aren't checked for things like malware. So while someone might be packaging something like XBMC for you, they could very easily also be adding some spyware/malware as well. This is why you shouldn't just add any random PPA.\n\nA: To develop PPA's on launchpad, the contributor must have signed the ubuntu code of conduct.  This signifies the the developer must abide to a minimum set of standards.\nUsually people should then consult the ubuntuforums to see who has used particular ppa's and if they could cause any issues.\nFor a \"novice\" or \"noob\" - my best advice is to steer clear of PPA's until you feel confident that you understand a few things about the command line, potential error messages and a few things how to diagnose issues.\nTo remove ppa's causing issues, you can most of the time use \"ppa_purge\"\nIf you are feeling nervous, then consider an image backup of your computer with a tool like clonezilla.  That way, if things go wrong and you cant resolve it, at least you have a quick means to restore your computer back to the way it was before you started playing.\nHaving said all that, ppa's are extremely useful to get the latest versions of software - especially for those that dont try to upgrade every 6 months and stick with the LTS version of ubuntu.\n\nA: When you add ppa and install a program through it.\nBasically you give permission to reside that program in allowed executable area (/bin/ /sbin/ /usr/bin/).\nNow if program itself is/has somehow a malware then system won't complain about it as you are the one who added ppa considering its trustworthy.\nWhen program comes from the Ubuntu repositories they are first checked (I would like to say thoroughly but I don't know :P) so those from Ubuntu repositories are free of malware/spywares for sure.\nFor any other ppa its upto you/user to decide whether to trust it or no.\n\nA: PPA (Personal Package Archive) are used to include a specific software to your Ubuntu, Kubuntu or any other PPA compatible distro. The \"safeness\" of a PPA depends mostly on 3 things:\n\n*\n\n*Who made the PPA - An official PPA from WINE or LibreOffice like ppa:libreoffice/ppa and a PPA that I created myself are not the same. You do not know me as a PPA maintainer, so the trust issue and safety is VERY low for me (Since I could have made a corrupted package, incompatible package or anything else bad), but for LibreOffice and the PPA they offer in their website, THAT gives a certain safety net to it. So depending on who made the PPA, how long he or she has been making and maintaining the PPA will influence a little bit on how safe the PPA is for you. PPA's as mentioned above in the comments are not certified by Canonical.\n\n\n*How many users have used the PPA - For example, I have a PPA from http://winehq.org in my personal PPA. Would you trust ME with 10 users that confirm using my PPA having 6 of them saying it sucks than to the one Scott Ritchie offers as ppa:ubuntu-wine/ppa in the official winehq website. It has thousands of users (including me) that use his PPA and trust his work. This is work that has several years behind it.\nYou can check the number of downloads from a PPA with the PPA Stats webpage.\n\n\n*How updated the PPA is - Let us say you are using Ubuntu 10.04 or 10.10, and you want to use THAT special PPA. You find out that the last update to that PPA was 20 years ago.. O.o. The chances you have on using THAT PPA are null. Why?. Because the package dependencies that PPA needs are very old and maybe the updated ones change so much code that they wont work with the PPA and possibly break your system if you install any of the packages of that PPA to your system.\nHow updated a PPA influences the decision to use it if he/she wants to use THAT PPA. If not they would rather go look for another one more up to date. You do not want Banshee 0.1 or Wine 0.0.0.1 or OpenOffice 0.1 Beta Alpha Omega Thundercat Edition with the latest Ubuntu. What you want is a PPA that is updated to your current Ubuntu. Remember that a PPA mentions for what Ubuntu version is made for or multiple Ubuntu versions was made for.\nAs an example of this here is an image of the versions that are supported in the Wine PPA:\n\nHere you can see that this PPA is supported since Dinosaurs.\nOne BAD thing about how updated a PPA is, if the PPA maintainer tends to push into the PPA the latest, greatest and cutting edge version of a specific package. The down side of this is that if you are going to test the latest of something, you ARE going to find some bugs. Try to stick with PPAs that are updated to a stable version and not a unstable, testing or dev version since it might/will contain bugs. The idea of having the latest is also to TEST and say what problems were found and solve them. An example of this are the daily Xorg PPAs and Daily Mozilla PPAs. You will get about 3 daily updates for X.org or Firefox if you get the dailies. This is because of the work the put in there and if you are using their daily PPAs it means you want to help with bug hunting or development and NOT for a production environment.\nBasically stick with this 3 and you will be safe. Always look for the maker/maintainer of the PPA. Always see if many users have used it and always see how updated the PPA is. Places like OMGUbuntu, Phoronix, Slashdot, The H, WebUp8 and even here in AskUbuntu are good sources to find many users and articles talking about and recommending some PPAs that they have tested.\nStable PPA Examples - LibreOffice, OpenOffice, Banshee, Wine, Kubuntu, Ubuntu, Xubuntu, PlayDeb, GetDeb, VLC are good and safe PPAs from MY experience.\nSemi Stable PPA - X-Swat PPA is a in the middle PPA between bleeding edge and stable.\nBleeding Edge PPA - Xorg-Edgers is a bleeding edge PPA although I should mention that after 12.04, this PPA has become more and more stable. I would still mark it as bleeding edge but it is stable enough for end users.\nSelectable PPA - Handbrake offers here a way for the user to choose, do you want a stable version or do you want the bleeding edge (Also referred to as Snapshot) version. In this case you can select what you want to use.\nNote that in the case of using for example the X-Swat ppa with the Xorg-Edgers PPA, you will get a mixed between the two (With priority towards Xorg-Edgers). This is because both are trying to include almost the same packages, so they will overwrite each other and only the most updated one will show in your repositories (Except if you manually tell it to grab the package from X-Swat).\nSome PPAs might update some of your packages when you add them to your repository because they will overwrite with their own version a certain package to make the PPA software work on your system correctly. This might be some code packages, python versions, etc.. Other like the LibreOffice PPA will remove all existence of the OpenOffice from your system to install the LibreOffice packages there. Basically read what other users have commented about a specific package and also read if the package is compatible with your Ubuntu version.\nAs the comment below suggest by Jeremy Bicha, some bleeding edge (PPAs that stay very up to date including adding Alpha, Beta or RC quality software in the PPA) could potentially damage your whole system (In the worst case). Jeremy mentions an example of many.\n\nA: All the concerns listed by others here are extremely important to understand. That said, since this is open source, we can tell exactly what the PPA has changed from the version of the package in Ubuntu. We'll use the PPA from this duplicate as an example.\nFirst we'll grab the source from the PPA dget a tool that will download all the pieces of a Debian source package given a link to the dsc file:\ndget -u https://launchpad.net/~anton0/+archive/unity/+files/unity_5.12-0ubuntu2~ppa1.dsc\n\nI found that link by clicking \"View package details\":\n\nAnd then:\n\nNext, we'll get the source of the package in the Ubuntu archive:\napt-get source unity\n\nFinally, we'll use debdiff to see the differences between the source of the two packages:\ndebdiff unity_5.12-0ubuntu1.1.dsc unity_5.12-0ubuntu2~ppa1.dsc\n\nThe output of that command is about three hundred lines long, so I'll put it on a pastebin instead of directly into the window. Now, I can't vouch for how good the code is since I don't really know C++, but it seems to be doing what it claims and not anything malicious.\n\nA: It isn't just a matter of malware, as has already been said.  It is also that some of the software might really still be in the testing stage and not ready for production use.  If you install it and rely upon it to get work done, you might find that it is buggy, unreliable, and can crash - leaving you without the work you have done.\nSome of it might also not get along well with other aspects of Ubuntu, such as Unity or Gnome, causing problems that are difficult to trace, and perhaps even making your system unstable.\nThis is not because the software is bad, but because it has perhaps not yet been fully tested, or because it was made available so that people could test it, but not yet intended to be generally released as production software.  So you should use caution, although some of it is really quite good.\nA number of months ago I installed a recommended package from a particular PPA, and it trashed my system enough that I had to reinstall Ubuntu.  I was a new user and didn't know what else to do; with a bit more knowledge I might have been able to solve the problem and restore it without doing a reinstall (although that, too, was useful to me in learning Ubuntu, but if I had worked saved on my machine I would have lost it).\nSo be careful, ask questions, make frequent backups (!!!), and know that malware is unlikely (though not impossible).\n\nA: A PPA is a web folder that contains software you can install. It really isn't much more complicated than that. When you install a package, you do that with root privileges and the package has scripts that are run, so they are run as root. That means installing any software is dangerous and you do need to trust the developer or distributor. \nAn apt archive, PPA or otherwise, is polled regularly for updates to software you have installed. The \"problem\" with that, is that anyone can provide a newer package of software you have installed. For instance, you can add a PPA in order to get a nice theme and automatic updates of that theme. But once you have added that repository, the owner can add a patched openssh-server package, for instance, and it will appear as an update in Ubuntu. This can be done a year after you added the PPA, so you need to pay attention to updates. \nThe PPA system does prevent third-parties from tampering with the packages, however, so if you do trust the developer/distributor, then PPAs are very safe. For instance, if you install Google Chrome, then they add a PPA so that you'll receive automatic updates for it. They add \"deb http://dl.google.com/linux/chrome/deb/ stable main\". If the DNS server you use was hacked to point dl.google.com somewhere else, then they could push patched software onto everyone who had installed Chrome. But Ubuntu would refuse to install them since they could not be signed with Googles private key. So in that regard, PPAs are very secure. \nIt is not possible to say that a PPA is safe or not. It depends on the people who use it to distribute software. With free software, people can look at the source and see if it is safe or not. When lots of people use an archive, like Ubuntu regular archives, then you have peer review. Small archives with few users don't have that, so they are less trustworthy. The main lesson is that no matter what system you use, you should take care when installing software. \n\nA: Building upon Luis Alvarado's answer, you should be aware of these risks:\n\n\n*\n\n*Malicious packages—Packages might try to harm you. This is easy for them because they can run any code with administrative privileges.\n\n*Poor quality or incompatible software—An application might not work well. It might accidentally cause damages by, for example, interfering with other software, destroying your data, or leaking private information.\n\n\nand you should be attentive to these factors:\n\n\n*\n\n*Honesty of the maintainer—Might the maintainer secretly try to harm you?\n\n*Security of the maintainer—Is the maintainer vulnerable to attack by a third party?\n\n*Reliability of the maintainer—Will the maintainer respond to the need for updates within a reasonable time frame? Are they committed to maintaining the PPA in the long-term?\n\n*Security of the repository—Are packages signed by the maintainer?\n\n*Performance of the software—Is the software bug-free and compatible with your system?\n\n", "Q: gedit messes up file names in headline I open several text files in gedit.

Many times, I will go to right click on something in Firefox 4, and the context menu will disappear the second I move my mouse. I can use the arrow keys to select.\nThis comes and goes. When I was running Maverick, and switched to Minefield, and it began to happen, I wondered if it was something to do with all my customisations and Compiz, but now it is happening in my fairly stock Natty amd64 install.\n\nA: This seems to be a bug with Unity; I've looked for a report on Launchpad but the keywords are so generic that it's not an easy search!  Anyway, for me the problem occurs as follows:\n1. Open Firefox on Workspace A.\n2. Do some other activity (maybe email in Thunderbird) on Workspace B.\n3. Use the keyboard to navigate back to Workspace A.  (i.e. Ctrl+Alt+Arrow)\n4.

This is a bit annoying though, as I prefer to use the keyboard as my primary input.\n\nA: I have encountered this problem in Firefox 4 as well, and unfortunately I have not found a permanent solution, but minimizing the window and then restoring it seems to fix the problem for me, so I'm guessing it should work for you too (hope it does).\n", "Q: How can I execute a command through a browser?

A bit complicated, as well as having a webserver running just for this task, but it is possible. \n\nA: Another approach: Have a website with an Java applet, which starts a  program.

They are handled separately by the shell, which in your case is run as root. But even if the permissions were correct, this command wouldn't cause the output of the daemon to be appended to the log file.\nFor illustration, this is what actually happens:\n\n\n*\n\n*The shell executes start-stop-daemon and redirects its output to solr.log. The file is going to be empty, because this command doesn't output anything (just try running it manually, without redirection).\n\n*The start-stop-daemon command processes its arguments and ends up calling /usr/bin/java -jar start.jar. Notice that there is no output redirection there, but the process is forked in the background, so the output ends up in /dev/null.\n\n\nIn other words, the daemon should either accept a log file argument, or you need to create a wrapper script that will handle the redirection. It might look as follows\n#/bin/sh\ncd /home/phuihock/src/proj/solr\nexec /usr/bin/java -jar start.jar >> logs/solr.log\n\n", "Q: Did the gtk-integration of LibreOffice improve with 3.4?

If it is, then I understand, (only, when it uses so much CPU, my system becomes almost unusable!) :)\nEDIT:\nOOPS! It wasn't actually Ubuntu-one (I had problems with it in the past and got the process name mixed up in my head/memory). Chipaca's answer is accurate for me.\n\nA: Syndaemon is «a program that monitors keyboard activity and disables the touchpad when the keyboard is being used». Nothing related to Ubuntu One.

However, the date/time isn't customizable, and it shows up sideways. Is there a clock replacement applet that will display the date and time in a vertical format?\n\nA: If you make the panel itself wider then the clock will adjust and display the time horizontally.  To do this right click on some blank area of the panel and select 'properties', then increase the size to 75 pixels or more and it should realign your clock.\n\nA: There is an XFCE applet that probably (I don't remember 100%, been a while) has this functionality.

How can I copy for installation in another computer?\n\nA: Usually GTK themes that installed by package manager stored is /usr/share/themes. When you install theme as user, it sets in .themes directory in your home.\nYou can just copy directory with the same name as theme you like into the same directory in another computer (to /usr/share/themes if you want use it system-wide, or in ~/.themes).  \nAlso you can check the index.theme and look for dependencies. For example this picture shows that the themes \"elementary\", \"eHomosapien\", \"elementary-monochrome\" and \"Shere_Khan_X\" are also needed for \"PinguyOS\" theme to work well.  \n\nFinally, to change the pointer the following is needed since Ubuntu 10.10:  \nEdit this file:  \ngksu gedit /usr/share/icons/default/index.theme  \n\nand add the theme you want (see this example:)  \n \nThan restart compiz:  \ncompiz --replace  \n\n\nA: Open terminal and\ntype sudo nautilus  \ngo to \n\n/usr/share/themes   \n\nYou will see some folders with the name of the themes installed.\ncopy the folder of the theme you were looking for and keep it somewhere else. \n\nwhen u want 2 use the same theme on another computer copy the folder. again open terminal and typesudo nautilus\nagain go to \n/usr/share/themes     \nand paste it there. then apply the theme using Gnome Tweak Tool\n", "Q: Why does my calculator automatically open (multiple times) when my computer is idle?

I tried reboot but the problem persist. What can I do to resolve this issue ?\n\nA: My guess is that the necessary image loading plugins are not enabled.\nIn the Image Loading category within CompizConfig Settings Manager, make sure the JPEG, Png, and/or Svg plugins are enabled to suit the types of images you are using for your wallpaper.\n", "Q: How can I change Unity's super-t binding to something else? First, I've tried searching several threads to find the answer, but I couldn't find one that solved my problem, so I'm opening a new one here.  \nI just installed Ubuntu 11.04 with the new Unity desktop, and I'm trying to change the key binding of Super+t from Open Trash (which I don't have much use for) to Open Terminal (which I use all the time).  I tried running \"Keyboard shortcuts\" and changing the binding in there to \"Mod t,\" but that didn't work and it seems to get overridden by something else.  \nSo then I installed compiz-config-settings-manager and I looked for a keybinding in there for Super+t, but I couldn't find any.  In fact, I even tried changing a random feature in ccsm to Super+t hoping that it would tell me there was a conflict with that binding and I could locate it there.  But instead it let me use Super+t. Sadly, after I changed it, I pressed Super+t and it still opened the trash.  \nIs there another place that I can change the key bindings of Super+t?\n\nA: This isn't a real answer to the question but another approach in unity manner.\nIf you use it often consider putting it into the unity launcher. Just search for \"terminal\" and then drag the icon to the left side pane. You can then start it with Super-[number].\nJust in case you're interested: I want to know the real answer too!\n\nA: My muscle memory is also programmed to use Super+t for open terminal, so I decided to make a ppa for this: https://launchpad.net/~hansvschoot/+archive/ubuntu/unity7.\nIt contains the unity 7.2 branch at the moment (which is used in 14.04) with line 56 of the launcher/TrashLauncherIcon.cpp commented out to remove the shortcut.\nSo if you are running ubuntu 14.04 you can run the following commands to add the ppa and install the modified unity:\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:hansvschoot/unity7\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install unity\n\nafterwards you can simply use the shortcuts tab under keyboard settings to assign Super+t to open a terminal\n\nA: In the Compiz Config open the Unity Plugin page, change the \"Key to show the launcher\" to anything other than just Super. Mine is Alt+Super.\nThis will alter all Unity shortcuts. \nSo opening the first program in your launcher is no longer Super+1 but Alt+Super+1.\nThey should really have a configuration panel for Unity shortcuts. \n\nA: The default shortcut for opening a terminal is Ctrl+Alt+T, so you don't necessarily need to change it, just start using the default.\nBut if you do want to customize shortcuts, the keyboard settings panel in Ubuntu 13.10 (I will confirm 14.04 soon), is where the \"Launch terminal\" shortcut is controlled.  \nI changed it to Super+T and it now works to open a terminal instead of the trash.\n", "Q: Highlight manpages syntax?

You can also set PAGER like daithib8 does but that is more general. MANPAGER overrides PAGER for the man command.\nFrom this\nexport MANPAGER=\"col -b | vim -c 'set ft=man ts=8 nomod nolist nonu' -c 'nnoremap i <nop>' -\"\n\nHe has some pretty good extra options such as setting ts (tabstop), nonu (nonumber), and unmapping i (insert). So I will merge the two solutions. Also made some improvements like using the command command and expanding arguments with \"$@\"\nAs a function:\nman() {\n  MANPAGER=\"col -b | vim -R -c 'set ft=man ts=8 nomod nolist nonu' -c 'nnoremap i <nop>' -\" command man \"$@\"\n}\n\nEDIT: scroll down to my UPDATE to see benefits of using this messy form and a cleaner way to write the function with some extra vim mappings.\n\nBut doing all this is a really big mess. The following solutions require installation but they are cleaner solutions.\nThese solutions don't have the Vim: Reading from stdin... that the above solution has.\nI recommend daithib8's answer except to use MANPAGER instead of PAGER since this question is just about manpages. And I would also add it to my .bash_profile or .profile so it doesn't get exported on each invocation of bash. You will have to install most though.\n# In .profile or .bash_profile\nMANPAGER='most'\n\nmost doesn't have hjkl movement like in vim and less, but it is the fastest.\nAlso, vimpager is pretty good. I like using it for huge manpages such as man bash. You get all the cool things from vim such as line numbers number, highlighted search hlsearch, and all your vim plugins.\nIf you have YouCompleteMe installed vimpager also doesn't show this message:\nThe ycmd server SHUT DOWN (restart with ':YcmRestartServer'). Unexpected exit code 1. Type ':YcmToggleLogs ycmd_54959_stderr_UvwUrj.log' to check the logs.\n\nNot sure why, but it's nice not to see that.\n# In .profile or .bash_profile\nexport MANPAGER='vimpager'\n\nStartup can be a bit slower than most because vimpager sources your .vimrc, which can be a good thing, if you want to use your vim plugins. To disable .vimrc sourcing:\n# In .profile or .bash_profile\nexport MANPAGER='vimpager -u NONE'\n\n\nYou can also do a hybrid approach with functions:\n# Use 'command man' instead of 'man' if you have overridden\n# 'man' with a function, like how I did in the \"messy\" solutions above.\n\nmanmost() {\n    MANPAGER='most' man \"$@\"\n}\n\nmanvim() {\n    MANPAGER='vimpager -u NONE' man \"$@\"\n}\n\nmanvimrc() {\n    MANPAGER='vimpager' man \"$@\"\n}\n\nSo now, export MANPAGER will set your default MANPAGER in your .bash_profile or .profile, but you can use any one of these functions to quickly use another MANPAGER.\n\nUPDATE\nActually, vimpager is a little different than actual vim. For example, in normal mode, w is mapped to b and b is mapped to & <C-B><SNR>1_L. But this is how other pagers are - less doesn't have a cursor.\nIf you would like to use actual vim, with a messy solution, I found this. It suppresses the Vim: Reading from stdin... with a hack. Still has the YouCompleteMe message though. You can probably set another -c command to do turn off YouCompleteMe. But I'll just ignore that message.\nmanrealvim() {\n  MANPAGER='bash -c \"vim -MRn -c \\\"set ft=man nomod nolist nospell nonu\\\" -c \\\"nm q :qa!<CR>\\\" -c \\\"nm <end> G\\\" -c \\\"nm <home> gg\\\"</dev/tty <(col -b)\"' man \"$@\"\n}\n\nIn newer vim versions, you can avoid this hack with --not-a-term:\nI cleaned up the function with newline escapes because this is the version I am using.\nmanvim() {\n  MANPAGER='col -b | '\\\n'vim -MR -c \"set ft=man ts=8 nomod nolist nospell nonu\" '\\\n'-c \"set colorcolumn= hlsearch incsearch\" '\\\n'-c \"nun <buffer> q\" '\\\n'-c \"nn q :qa!<CR>\" '\\\n'-c \"nn <end> G\" '\\\n'-c \"nn <home> gg\" '\\\n'- --not-a-term' man \"$@\"\n}\n\nOr you can just use neovim > v0.2.2:\n# not sure why but the -M flag breaks it but it's not required\n# Seems like nvim already sets -M when ft=man\nmannvim() {\n  MANPAGER='col -b | '\\\n'nvim -R -c \"set ft=man ts=8 nomod nolist nospell nonu\" '\\\n'-c \"nun <buffer> q\" '\\\n'-c \"nn q :qa!<CR>\" '\\\n'-c \"nn <end> G\" '\\\n'-c \"nn <home> gg\" '\\\n'-' man \"$@\"\n}\n\nYou might want to look through the vim options passed to customize. I looked through them from all those posts I listed and chose the ones I liked. Or you can just copy me.\nYou could also parse vim --version to determine whether to use the hack or --not-a-term. I won't do that here.\n\nMY CURRENT METHOD\nIf you would like to set this vim method as your default MANPAGER, do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Add these executable scripts in your path:\nThere are two scripts because the first is for general paging (replacement for less), while the second is for manpaging (has manpage syntax highlighting.\n# Put this in ~/bin/vimrealpager\n# I call it vimrealpager to avoid name clashes with vimpager mentioned above\n# Make sure ~/bin/ is in your path\n\n# ***SCRIPT START***\n\n#!/usr/bin/env sh\n\ncol -b |\nvim -MR -c 'set nomod nolist nospell nonu' \\\n-c 'set colorcolumn= hlsearch incsearch' \\\n-c 'nn q :qa!<CR>' \\\n-c 'nn <end> G' \\\n-c 'nn <home> gg' \\\n\"$@\" \\\n--not-a-term \\\n-\n\n# Put this in ~/bin/vimrealmanpager\n# ***SCRIPT START***\n\n#!/usr/bin/env sh\n\nvimrealpager -c 'set ft=man' \\\n-c 'nun <buffer> q'\n\n\n*In your ~/.profile:\nexport MANPAGER='vimrealmanpager'\n\nYou could also do export -f on the functions I showed earlier, but it works in bash but not POSIX shell, so you would have to put it in .bash_profile instead of .profile.\nA similar thing can be done for nvim but I'm not gonna add it here unless requested.\n", "Q: Constraint-based software to help with scheduling Overview\nI have a set of duties I must schedule employees for. The duties recur weekly over a two-month period. There are a number of constraints that define a good schedule. (See below for examples.) In the past, I've made the schedule by hand, but doing it by hand is time-consuming and virtually guarantees a buggy schedule.\nI'm looking for software that will make the schedule for me. I've tried TaskJuggler, but I'm not sure whether it's even capable of doing what I want (the documentation is unhelpful and the folks on the mailing list merely tell me to read the documentation--which I've done without conclusive results).\nCan anybody recommend something?\nDetails\nExample schedule\nHere's an example schedule. Note that since this one was handmade, it contains an error or two.\n\nExample constraints\nHere are some of my constraints:\n\n\n*\n\n*All scheduled duties must be able to be manually-specified.\n\n*Each teacher must have exactly two weekends off. Some weekends are defined as mandatory working weekends; no teacher may have those weekends off. Other weekends may be mandatory off weekends; such weekends have no scheduled duties and count toward each teacher's two weekends off. Finally, there may be other weekends which have no assigned duties but nevertheless don't count toward teachers' two weekends off.\n\n*Duties should be assigned as evenly as possible. This means that so far as possible, each teacher must have a given duty the same number of times, have each different duty an equal number of times, and have an equal weight of duties on a given weekend (see below for weighting duties). Where this is not possible, the surplus duties should be balanced between teachers. Ideally, surplus duties should be scheduled taking into account each teacher's preferred duties; thus, a teacher who prefers the children's story might get it an extra time instead of one who really doesn't like it.\n\n*No teacher should have the same duty on consecutive weeks.\n\n*No teacher may be scheduled on their weekend off.\n\n*No teacher may have simultaneous duties.\n\n*The major duties are TGIF and the sermon.\n\n*No teacher should have another duty on the same day as they are scheduled for a major duty.\n\n*No teacher should have more than one major duty per week.\n\n*If possible, no teacher should have a major duty on consecutive weeks. This, however, is not a particularly high-priority constraint.\n\n\nA: I've managed to work around this issue, finally. Apparently, software like I'm looking for doesn't exist, and I don't have the time or know-how to write it myself.\nHere's what I've ended up doing:\n\n\n*\n\n*First, I reordered the columns in my schedule so that it's easier to see my constraints at a glance, at the cost of a slightly less-logical order.\n\n*More recently, I switched my schedule from LibreOffice Calc to a Google Docs spreadsheet. I lost a lot of formatting capability, but I gained some scriptability. (I never could figure out how to write a macro for LO or OOo; their documentation is absolutely horrible.)\n\n*Then, I wrote a script in Google Apps that gives me some buttons that, when I click them, highlight all cells with the same contents. This makes it feasible for me to manually verify that my schedule is correct. Here is an example of my schedule.\nThis approach isn't really what I wanted, but it works well enough.\n\nA: I would use a calendar application, like Lightning in Thunderbird, and have the rotations set up as repeating events on the calendar. That way, if you start at 9:00 and have to switch every half hour, set alarms for 9:30, 10:00 etc, with the description of the shifts on each event. \nFinding an application that performs this task exclusively would be pretty difficult since it would have to be specifically written for this type of work. There might be something out there that would get this job done, but I haven't heard of it. I believe the calendar should be useful until you manage to find something more specific though.\n", "Q: How do I upgrade from Ubuntu 10.10 to Ubuntu 11.04? the update manager isn't picking up 11.04\n\nA: Ubuntu 11.04 is still in Beta (2nd Beta) and is due for release on 28th April, so until then, your update manager won't allow you to upgrade to the 11.04 (the reason being is unstable). You can upgrade to Ubuntu 11.04 from your maverick installation only through ISO of 11.04 (as it has option to upgrade during installation), but it is not recommended for production system, but it will be appreciated if you upgrade to unstable and report any bugs that you find, or you wait until 28th April to get fairly stable version of Ubuntu.\n\nA: By default, update-manager will only prompt you to upgrade to released versions of Ubuntu.  As 11.04 has not officially been released yet, you were not prompted.\nThat said, if you want to upgrade anyway you can run the following command (from a terminal, or with Alt+F2):\nupdate-manager -c -d\n\nThis tells the update manager to check for new Ubuntu releases and include development releases in the search.  This should give you the opportunity to upgrade to the 11.04 beta.\nIf you continue to apply updates as they come out, this will eventually give you the final 11.04 release when it is ready.\n", "Q: using wget to download pictures results in junk files commands:  \nmkdir -p sun-yat-sen && wget --directory-prefix=sun-yat-sen -r  -nd -np -A.jpg -erobots=off http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Yat-sen_University\n\nThere are several pics on the link: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Yat-sen_University,\nafter the download process,what i get is all those junk jpg files which could not open by my gnome imgae viewer.\nso,what is the reason ?\nthanks in advance\n\nA: Wikipedia has information pages about each image it hosts with the name of that image (e.g. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:North_Square_of_SYSU.jpg).

(moved by suggestion of @Jorge Castro)\nI'd like to use stickynotes_applet in Unity.. Now in Gnome, this applet gets added to a bar, then I have to click it to create a new note, and I can call preferences to have the notes stick on the desktop - which is all I need. \nObviously, as mentioned here, it will not be possible to use this applet directly in Unity; but basically, all I'd need to do is to raise the Preferences window (so as to make the notes stick), and to somehow issue a command for a new note (which would otherwise be performed by a click on the applet icon in the Gnome bar). \nI have tried running '/usr/lib/gnome-applets/stickynotes_applet' and seemingly it runs, although no applet icon is shown (which is expected), and no any other windows either (which I otherwise hoped will show :) ). \nSo I was wandering - given that this applet doesn't (seem to) have anything special related to desktop - is there a command line way to basically run this applet, issue a 'Show Preferences' command to it, and issue a new note command to it within a Unity environment (currently I can call tomboy from command line and it works - but its windows are too clunky for my taste)? \n(and bonus question - how would you start an applet related window only from the command line in classic Gnome?)\nDesktop integration doesn't matter all that much to me - I'd run this manually from the command line gladly, as long as I get small compact notes that stay on the desktop (as long as the process is active).. \nThanks for any comments,\nCheers!\n\nA: You could have a small gnome-panel running your applet only. See How do I use the GNOME Panel in Unity?\n\nA: I came back to this problem again (still on Natty); so I thought I'd post my results. \nFirst, I started looking up if you can run Gnome applets from the command line, and in a separate window - turns out, this was a technique for debugging Python applets;\n\n\n*\n\n*First I stumbled upon this: Zaur Nasibov's Beginner's guide to creating a GNOME applet with Python (Part I)\n\n*Then I went into patching invest-applet (which is in Python) so it again works on Natty; patch can be found in Bug #775387 “Invest-applet fails to start after upgrade to Natty...” : Bugs : “gnome-applets” package : Ubuntu\n\n*Finally, I developed a Python script, that instantiates an invest-applet object when called from the command line, and puts it in its own window - and this happens to work in Unity: \n\n\n\nThis is the script:\nimport sys\nimport gtk\nimport pygtk\npygtk.require('2.0')\n# sudo apt-get install python-gnomeapplet\nimport gnomeapplet\nimport CORBA # must have import gnomeapplet before!\nimport bonobo\nimport bonobo.ui\nimport bonobo.activation\n\nbcontrol = bonobo.activation.activate_from_id('OAFIID:Invest_Applet', 0, False)\nwin = bonobo.ui.Window(\"foo\", \"FOOOOO\")\nbuiwid = bonobo.ui.widget_new_control_from_objref(bcontrol, win.get_ui_container().corba_objref())\nwin.set_contents(buiwid)\nwin.show_all()\nwin.connect(\"destroy\", lambda x: sys.exit(0))\nbonobo.ui.main()\n\n... and the extended script (with debug output, and a ton of messy comments) is in gtk_bonobo_applet_widget.py. \n\nThis is exactly what I wanted, and at first, I thought that it would be applicable to all applets - at least in Natty (and among them stickynotes); but alas, no:\nNow, Natty is a bit specific, because it is the last Gnome 2 Ubuntu - however, it also features (the first) Unity. As such: \n\n\n*\n\n*some applets are based on (or exposing a) bonobo/CORBA interface (in Python, via gnomeapplet); those, like invest-applet or brightness-applet, can use the above technique to be raised in their own window - and can be queried through libbonobo2-bin tools (like activation-client)\n\n*other applets, like stickynotes, have migrated toward GSettings/DBUS base (interface) \n\n\nIn fact, stickynotes migrated from bonobo to dbus shortly before Natty came out (in the revision Port to new libpanel-applet API); which is obvious by the replacement of the PANEL_APPLET_BONOBO_FACTORY macro with PANEL_APPLET_OUT_PROCESS_FACTORY. Arguably, if one checks out the last revision of stickynotes based on bonobo and builds it - one should also be able to use the above technique to instantiate the applet in a separate window, and run it from there, even without gnome-panel. \nI would have otherwise believed, that all applets (or rather, applet developing frameworks) should have the capability to run in a separate window like that - if not for any other reason, then to facilitate debugging of applets during development. And given that some applets have command line switches for running in a separate window (both the \"beginner's guide\" above, and also invest-applet, feature such switches) - I hoped maybe stickynotes features such command line arguments too; however, I did grep through its source files - and alas, I cannot find any mention of command line options.  \nBut then, I wondered - why this migration? Well, it is because bonobo is (or rather, has been) deprecated for a while now:\nAppletsDbusMigration - GNOME Live!: (2009)\n\nGnome Panel drop the libbonobo dependency recently (see bug #572131). \n\ngnome-devel-list mailing list - What will replace bonobo? (2009)\n\nDbus is not a direct replacement for bonobo.\n  There is no exact replacement of bonobo as such.\n  ...\n  However, the main usecase of bonobo, which is embedding one application in another (say mine-sweeper in gnumeric, or (slighly more useful) a dia diagram in gnumeric) just is not used all that much. \n\ngnome-components mailing list 'Re: What will replace bonobo?' (2005)\n\n> About DBUS it's hard to say that it will be replacement some day.\n  > First problem is that it's not component system, just message passing API.\n  Trust me, there are definitely plans to implement an IDL compiler of\n  some sort to imitate CORBA-style RPC on top of D-BUS messages.  It will\n  happen sooner or later.\n\nWell, shucks - I myself think, the \"embedding one application in another\" was very useful in this case - to run (at least some) applets in Unity, with support for them removed :) Of course, it was a more-less a \"lucky\" arrangement of desktop packages in Natty that allowed for that (given that it is still Gnome 2 and still has the bonobo libraries) - obviously, later versions that are Gnome 3 based have bonobo removed completely - and the above Python-script-instantiation-in-a-window technique will most definitely not work there :/\nThe final question is - could we similarly use a Python script, but with bindings for dbus, to achieve something similar to the above bonobo based script? \nClosest I got to that, is with the script gtk_dbus_applet_widget.py, however, that script doesn't raise an applet in a window - and cannot even add an applet to the bar! The only thing it can do, is talk to the applet \"factory\" via dbus, and instruct it to create an applet; but this applet remains simply as data somewhere on the filesystem (and it persists across reboots!), and never becomes instantiated as a Gnome widget... And given the comments above, I doubt something like that is currently (well, on Natty at least) possible with dbus. \nIn conclusion - I guess this, along with the gnome-panel technique, exhausts the possibilities of frivolously running applets under Unity in Natty. \n\nA: Rhinote has keyboard shortcuts  \n\nA: For those who are still looking for something similar, handy and supporting Note Category feature, there is Indicator Sticky notes.\nInstallation: \nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:umang/indicator-stickynotes\n\nsudo apt-get update\n\nsudo apt-get install indicator-stickynotes\n\nHope it'll help...\nEnjoy!\n", "Q: How to install Firefox 3.6 and 4.0+ in parallel? Up until last week, I had both Firefox 3.6 and Firefox 4.0 installed, which was good for testing web applications.\nBut now the nightly channel contains Firefox 6 instead of Firefox 4. I tried using the stable channel, but that replaced Firefox 3.6.\n\nA: in the answer below, \"Firefox 3.6\" is the installed version, \"Firefox 4\" is another version you want to use\nThe Firefox package from Mozilla can be extracted to any directory, like /opt or your home directory. I'm using separate profiles for Firefox 3.6 and 4 for optimal compatibility.\n\n\n*\n\n*Download Firefox from mozilla.com to your home directory. (note that these packages are built for 32-bit systems, 64-bit systems may encounter strange issues like missing icons)\n\n*Open a terminal and extract the archive to ~/firefox by running:\ntar xjf firefox-4.0.tar.bz2\n\n(replace the filename accordingly)\n\n*Create the directory ~/bin if non-existent and make a link named firefox4 to the Firefox 4 executable:\nmkdir ~/bin\nln -s ~/firefox/firefox ~/bin/firefox4\n\nIf you ~/bin was previously non-existent, you need to re-login to update your the path in which Ubuntu searches for applications. From now on, you can run Firefox 4 by executing firefox4. If you wish to use Firefox 4 instead of the Firefox version installed on the system, run:\nln -s ~/bin/firefox ~/bin/firefox4\n\nImportant: if you download Firefox from Mozilla, the auto-update feature of Firefox is enabled. The package manager (apt) does not take care of updating the Firefox package from Mozilla. To check for updates manually, go to Help => Check for updates.\nOptional steps if you'd like to run Firefox 3.6 and 4 simultaneously with a single command:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create new profile for Firefox 4 by starting the Profile Manager:\nfirefox4 -ProfileManager\n\n\n*Press Create Profile and enter firefox4 as profile name. Press Finish when done.\n\n*Create the file ~/bin/fx4, containing:\n#!/bin/sh\nfirefox4 --no-remote -P firefox4 \"$@\"\n\n\n*Create the file ~/bin/fx, containing:\n#!/bin/sh\nfirefox --no-remote -P default \"$@\"\n\n(replace default by your profile name for Firefox 3.6)\nIt's assumed that the Firefox executable is Firefox 3.6 which is the case on Maverick (10.10), but not Natty (11.04).\n\n*Make it executable:\nchmod +x ~/bin/fx4 ~/bin/fx\n\n\n*From now on, you can run the Firefox 4 profile by executing fx4 and Firefox 3.6 by running fx.\n\n\nA: Here is what I did for checking out firefox 4 along with pre-installed firefox 3.6 in ubuntu 10.10. You can run only one version at a time and some extensions may not work. \n\n\n*\n\n*Download firefox4 \n\n*extract it somewhere with file-roller or you can\nuse tar command \n\n*create a symlink in system path  \nsudo ln -s /path/to/firefox4/firefox /usr/local/bin/firefox4\n\n*run firefox with firefox4 command\nfrom terminal or you can create a\nlauncher on the panel as well.\n\nA: If you download the packages of firefox 4 or later, you can extract the folder, and run the script in the folder named firefox: firefox  will open up, with your addons, setting, and bookmarks in place.\nNOTE: but in this way the two browsers cannot be used at the same time: one has to be closed (check task manager) for the other to start.\n\nTo be able to start both at the same time and to avoid searching for compatibility with addons and so on, you might consider using modified versions of Mozilla Firefox ('clones', re-branded browsers) that do not interfere with each other, like Icecat instead of Firefox 4+ (sudo add-apt-repository ppa:gnuzilla-team/ppa && sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install icecat -y) or (if you want to have latest Firefox) Swiftweasel instead of Firefox 3.6.   \n", "Q: How do I suspend over ssh? I guess this question is pretty much the same as How to configure dbus to allow ssh-user to suspend server?; except I wanted to formulate it better. \nAssume I have an Ubuntu server running nonstop, let's call it MyServer. Let's say then, I have another PC on the same local network as MyServer, let's call it MyLocalPC. \nMyLocalPC is then kept in suspend, unless it is turned on via wakeonlan by MyServer. This part of the process works perfectly for me: I can log in via ssh to MyServer, and on the MyServer ssh prompt I can issue wakeonlan, and MyLocalPC wakes up - great. \nThen, however, as soon as I'm done working with MyLocalPC, I'd like to put it into suspend again. The problem is as follows - I can put the machine in suspend easy, if I ssh into MyLocalPC first via ssh:\n[MyServer]$ ssh MyLocalPC\n[MyLocalPC]$ dbus-send --session --dest=org.freedesktop.PowerManagement --type=method_call --print-reply --reply-timeout=2000 /org/freedesktop/PowerManagement org.freedesktop.PowerManagement.Suspend\n\nThis will suspend MyLocalPC - but will also block the ssh exiting properly, and eventually the ssh to MyServer ends up frozen. I try to get tricky and issue something like this: \n[MyServer]$ ssh MyLocalPC \"dbus-send --session --dest=org.freedesktop.PowerManagement --type=method_call --print-reply --reply-timeout=2000 /org/freedesktop/PowerManagement org.freedesktop.PowerManagement.Suspend\"\nFailed to open connection to \"session\" message bus: /bin/dbus-launch terminated abnormally with the following error: Autolaunch error: X11 initialization failed.\n\nThen I read somewhere DISPLAY variable should be defined - but that fails too: \n[MyServer]$ ssh MyLocalPC \"DISPLAY=:0 dbus-send --session --dest=org.freedesktop.PowerManagement --type=method_call --print-reply --reply-timeout=2000 /org/freedesktop/PowerManagement  org.freedesktop.PowerManagement.Suspend\"\nError org.freedesktop.DBus.Error.ServiceUnknown: The name org.freedesktop.PowerManagement was not provided by any .service files\n\nSo does anyone know how can I issue a suspend to MyLocalPC, without the ssh connection to MyServer freezing?\n\nA: Just type <enter>~& (that's three keystrokes: enter, squggle, ampersand) and ssh will go into the background, and eventually timeout by itself.  That's good if you want to just abandon an interactive session in a case like this.\nOr, alternatively, put that into a shell script on MyLocalPC and connect in a way that will background the connection:\nssh -f MyLocalPC go-to-sleep\n\n\nA: For me the simplest is to use the at command:\necho 'pm-suspend' | sudo at now + 2 minutes\n\nThen disconnect from SSH session.\n\nA: You need to enable the X11 forwarding using ssh -Y. Alternatively, use at now + 2 minutes to run the command only once (see man at for more information).\n\nA: set a cron job for 2 minutes in the future and disconnect\n\nA: I know this is a very old question, but on Ubuntu 22.04, I've been using\nsudo systemctl suspend && exit\nto suspend the machine and immediately exit the SSH connection.\n\nA: How can I break out of ssh when it locks?\nThere are many valid solutions.\nOne has been mentioned by poolie; I have set up a keep-alive timeout on my system that will auto-suspend hanging SSH sessions by adding the following to ~/.ssh/config:\nHost *\nServerAliveInterval 5\nServerAliveCountMax 4\n\nWorks also after suspending the remote machine.\n", "Q: What is kernel panic? I just completed an OS course. I heard the phrase \"kernel panic\" a lot. Can you explain \n\n\n*\n\n*What is a kernel panic?\n\n*Why does it occur? \n\n*How can I find out that a kernel panic occurred?\n\n*What effect does it have on the system?\n\n*Does it only occur in Linux?\n\n*How can I prevent it?\n\n\nA: 1 Question at a time per the FAQ \n\n\n*\n\n*What is kernel panic?\nWhen the kernel can't load properly or \"freaks out\" and fails to boot properly or crashes(see edit credit at the bottom). \n\n*Why it occurs?\nHosed updates, failing hardware, unsupported hardware, failed or missing drive or partition (see edit credit at the bottom)  \n\n*How can I understand kernel panic occurred?\nWatch boot prompts(turn off quiet kernel parameter) OR your machine fails to boot  \n\n*What effect it has on system?\nFailure to boot or system crash\n\n*Does it only occur in Linux?\nNo, all unix-like operating systems can have kernel panics.  It's the equivalent of a Windows Blue Screen of Death \n\n*How can I prevent it?\nIt normally doesn't happen.  Test updates and troubleshoot the problem.  Use stable instead of development branches.  \nAdditional note: Kernel panic and system failure/shutdown can be directly responsible for protecting your computer from physical damage.  Examples include halting before extreme overheating or disk corruption.  See edit credits at the bottom for direct quote.  \nedits\nPer B. Roland Missing or corrupted disks or volumes can cause this as well.\n(Good point and I overlooked it)  \nPer Kees Kernel panic can also occur while running.\nnote: Can happen when a function fails sort of gracefully inside the kernel, but most often happens during module or kernel loading(which is usually during boot).  I thought I touched on it at \"during boot or system crash\", but I see how my answer to (1) stated it only occurs during boot.  \nPer rafalcieslak direct quote - 'There is one very important thing that must be added: The main point in the whole kernel panic is to protect your computer. The kernel freezes not only because it failed to do something, but also in order to prevent your computer from f.e. overheating, hard drives corruption, and any other hardware problems, that may occur, if some incorrect orders are executed, of a module (for example a module responsible for controlling the fan) failed to load, etc. This is why the kernel prefers to freeze, than to overcome the problem.'  \n\nA: A kernel panic happens when the kernel detects an error from which it can't recover.  A function named panic() to handle this situation (often by dumping some debug info and/or rebooting the system) was first introduced in one of the very early UNIX versions, so that's where the name comes from (and it's still called that in most UNIX-like operating systems, including Mac OS X).\nThe famous Blue Screen Of Death (officially called a Fatal system error, as in VMS/OpenVMS) in Microsoft's NT kernel is also a form of \"kernel panic\".\nA linux kernel error from which the kernel can (partially or temporarily) recover is called a kernel oops (you might see those in dmesg output sometimes).\nThe reasons for a kernel panic can be a bug in the kernel (e.g. in a driver that is part of the kernel) or a hardware or software issue that causes an unexpected/unpredictable condition for the kernel (e.g. when it is impossible to start the init proces, or it gets killed).\nTo find out what caused it you can see if anything was printed on the screen or to a serial console (if you configured one).  If it is configured to do so you can also have the system make a linux kernel crash dump, which saves the kernel memory to disk in case of a panic, so that a kernel developer can analyze it (of course, that requires it to be able to write to a disk).  In some cases /var/log/messages might also have useful info (e.g. in some cases recovering from an oops may lead to an unrecoverable error later).  There is some more detailed info here.\n\nA: I have a kernel panic on my system right now, Ubuntu 16.04.  My computer had been complaining the boot disk was full, so I ran 'apt autoremove'. It removed what I thought were unnecessary files, and the result is the kernel panic. \nSo I guess any level of editing of the boot disk can cause a kernel panic. So don't fool around with it if you're not paying attention to what you are doing.\n\nA: @RobotHumans' answer addresses all the parts of your question. However, I would like to elaborate the causes of Kernel Panic.\nFirstly, there are 2 types of Kernel Panic - Soft Kernel Panic(also known as Oops)and (Hard Kernel Panics, also knows as Aieee!).\nA system runs into hard kernel panic mode when it encounters an exception that cannot be handled. Soft kernel panics are relatively easier to handle.\nCauses of Kernel Panic\nThere are several causes, but most common are listed below:\n\n\n*\n\n*Defective or Incompatible RAM is the most common and frequent cause of Kernel Panic.\n\n*Obsolete, Incompatible or Corrupted Kernel Extensions\n\n*Obsolete, Incompatible or Corrupted Kernel Drivers.\n\n*Hard disk corruption or issues such as bad sectors or directory corruption can also lead to kernel panic.\n\n*Insufficient RAM or Hard disk space\n\n*Defective hardware, badly written programs or hardware failures can also lead to kernel Panic.\n\n\nThis is also important to note that only modules that are located within the kernel space can cause kernel panic. lsmod command can be run to get a list of dynamically loaded modules.\nTo troubleshoot kernel panic, check /var/log/messages. Sometimes all of the information might be logged there while sometimes nothing related to kernel panic might be logged there. Although it is inevitable to run into kernel panics, there's nothing much to worry about.\n", "Q: Installing F-Prot I downloaded the free-edition of F-Prot Anti-Virus for Linux.

It worked fine but then i also installed Kubuntu (now its a dual boot). Whenever I run Kubuntu my clock changes time by -4 hours and when I again run Windows its time too has changed. So every time i set my clock in windows, Kubuntu changes it by -4hrs and this also effects my windows clock any help?\n\nA: By default Ubuntu assumes that the BIOS clock is set to UTC and adds or subtracts the appropriate amount of hours from it to get your localised system time. By contrast, Windows sets its system time directly to the time shown by the BIOS clock on boot. Thus, Windows assumes BIOS clock to be in your local time.\nIf Ubuntu keeps showing the correct time automatically and Windows keeps reverting to UTC, your Ubuntu installation is probably set to automatically get the correct time from a time server on boot.\nThe easiest way to fix the problem is to edit /etc/default/rcS and change the line that says UTC=yes to UTC=no. You can open the file for editing by opening a terminal and entering:\nsudo nano /etc/default/rcS\n\nThen simply find the appropriate line, replace yes with no, and save. If you prefer a graphical text editor try using gedit (Ubuntu) or kate (Kubuntu) instead of nano in the above command.\n\nA: Have you tried changing the Time Settings to update manually?\n\n\nA: Remember during installation when it asked if your clock was set to UTC and said \"If you're not sure answer this question no\"?  You answered incorrectly.\n\nA: Windows uses GMT to set it's clock time , while Linux uses UTC (the BIOS uses UTC too hence the BIOS and Linux clock's are the same).\nThat's why booting into Linux and then into Windows changes it's clock by ~4 hours.\n", "Q: Discover Whether A Program Is Installed From Python3 Script Within my python3 software I need to check to see if git is installed. I know that from the terminal I can type:\ndpkg --get-selections > filename\n\nto find what programs are installed and then put that into a file.\nFrom there, how would I get python to see if git is installed? Or is there an easier way?\n\nA: You may use the python apt module, but it only checks if the package is installed. It will fail non-deb distributions or if installed outside the package manager:\nimport apt\ncache = apt.Cache()\ncache.open()\n cache[\"git-core\"].is_installed# Evaluates true if git is installed\n\nTry to run git and handle the exception if it fails:\nimport subprocess\n\ntry:\n    # pipe output to /dev/null for silence\n    null = open(\"/dev/null\", \"w\")\n    subprocess.Popen(\"git\", stdout=null, stderr=null)\n    null.close()\n\nexcept OSError:\n    print(\"git not found\")\n\nA third option would be to try all the paths in $PATH and test if you have exec permission on path/git.\n\nA: Look for installed files\nAssuming we know where the application's launcher or binary is installed by default an easy to do approach would be to just check for it's existence like:\n#! /usr/bin/env python3\n#\n# Query package state by installation path\n\nimport os.path\npath = '/usr/bin/git'\n\n\ndef query_package(path):\n    if os.path.exists(path):\n        print('Git is ready to use')\n    else:\n        print('please install Git')\n\nConsult DPKG\nAnother way to query installed packages however is to consult the package management, in our case dpkg:\n#! /usr/bin/env python3\n#\n# Query package state by dpkg status\n\nimport subprocess\npackage = 'git'\n\ndef query_package(package):\n    status = subprocess.getstatusoutput(\"dpkg-query -W -f='${Status}' \" + package)\n    if not status[0]:\n        print(status[1]) # package is installed\n    else:\n        print(status[1])\n\n\nA: If you wanted to do it that way you could do something like:  \ncheckvar = 0  \nfor line in open(\"filename\"):  \n    if \"git\" in line:  \n        checkvar = checkvar + 1  \nprint \"Phrase git found \", checkvar, \" times\"\n\nA: I would take a different approach. In order to check whether Git is available on a given system, either check if the git binary exist in user's PATH, or just try to execute git --version. This check will be more reliable, and it supports people who (for any reason) install Git from source in /usr/local/bin, or even ~/bin.\nThis is not a direct answer to your question, but I hope it helps anyway. If you need a help in coding that in Python, let me know and I'll provide more details.\n\nA: You could also try checking the output of which.\n(Maybe that won't work as no one else has suggested it?)\n\nA: TLDR: As of 2022, use the subprocess module (which is awesome)! And here's the onliner:\nimport subprocess; subprocess.run([\"git\", \"--version\"], stdout=subprocess.DEVNULL, check=True)\n\nThe subprocess Module:\nThe subprocess module is the epitome of all reasons why Python is an amazing scripting language! I use it for everything where a Shell script might end up being too unmaintainable & cluttered.\nOn that note, here's the update code snippet you should be using right now for Python v3.5+:\nimport subprocess\n\nsubprocess.run([\"git\", \"--version\"], stdout=subprocess.DEVNULL, check=True)\n\nThe subprocess.run() Function is All You'll Ever Need:\nIntroduced in Python v3.5, the run() function is all you'll ever need to invoke a tool from a Python script. And in addition, it's check parameter will throw a CalledProcessError in case the process(es) exits with a non-zero code. Hence, you can easily check if a tool is installed or simply by passing True to the check parameter of the run() function.\n", "Q: Hard Drive Partitioning I have a question: Is there a \"correct\" way to configure the partitions on my hard drive for an Ubuntu installation?\nI have a 250GB disk and now I have the following partitions:  (Partitions in this order on my HDD.)\n\n\n*\n\n*50GB (ext4) File System Mount Point /  \n\n*180GB (NTFS) Personal Files  \n\n*4GB (SWAP)\n\n\nI have a Toshiba A200-21T Laptop and I would like to have the best performance and stability possible with Ubuntu. So far, I have no grievances with the installation I have, but, I'm a new Ubuntu user and I wonder if this hard drive configuration is correct.\nThanks.\n\nA: I don't think there's a perfect \"correct\" way of partitioning, it really depends on your needs.\nI personally keep my swap partition near the beginning, simply so I don't need to move it if I'm extending the other partition. But that's a convenience not a performance issue.\nAs far as your configuration being correct, I'm not a hard drive / OS expert, but I think that's fine. I doubt changing the order would really impact your performance.\n\nA: There's no \"perfect\" way.  \nMore frequently used partitions can be placed at the back end of the disk(slightly faster read speeds at the outside of the platter are possible in some instances).  \nUsually RAM <= Swap <= double RAM.  This is so that suspend/hibernate works as expected.  \nThe rest of the thing is subjective and based on your use.  \nExamples:\nA HUGE webserver for example would need a lot of space in /var.\nA massively multi-user server might need a huge /home.\nFor simple home use, most users won't realize a lot of benefit from segregating into a bunch of partitions(completely different for servers and business users).  \nI, for example, put /usr/ports on a completely separate disk when running FreeBSD so I can make everything I use on most installs and move the disk about the lab/office/home and cut my compile time(must compile for generic, no optimizations, and same architecture in that case).

You will need to join it to the PDC using the \"net join\" command. After the second machine is joined to the domain the workstations should be able to access it without re-entering credentials (assuming they log on to the domain through the PDC).\nSee also http://www.samba.org/samba/docs/man/Samba-HOWTO-Collection/domain-member.html\n", "Q: Which keyboard setting corresponds to \"United States (International)\" in Windows XP I'm running both Ubuntu (10.04) and WinXp on the same machine, thus using the same keyboard. On Windows I have selected \"United States (International)\" as my keyboard setting.\nIn Ubuntu I have \"USA International (AltGr Dead Keys)\". However, they work slightly different.\nWhen I press the \" -key (or the '-key) in Windows, the resulting character depends on the next typed character. For example I can get foreign characters like é and ë.\nWhen I press the \" -key in Ubuntu, it just displays a \" character, thus not allowing me to get special characters.\nI prefer the Windows version, but don't know how to get this done in Ubuntu. \nHere's a few screenshots to show you in case I failed to explain:\nWindows:\n\nUbuntu (same key sequence):\n\n\nA: Use the English (US, Alternative international) layout.\n\nA: You have to combine the dead key with the right alt key. For example, to get é, type RightAlt+' then E.\nI've encountered the other option in the past (possibly back in the days when I used XP) and been annoyed by it. In my view, Ubuntu's approach is superior. After all, typing ' is more common than typing é; thus, it should be easier to type.\n\nA: If you still want the dead key behaviour (typing ' and e resulting in é), you can use the English (US, international with dead keys) layout.\n", "Q: What does \"cp: omitting directory\" mean? I've issued the following command:\nsudo cp ~/Transfers/ZendFramework-1.11.4-minimal/library/Zend/* ~/public_html/cmsk.dev/library/\n\nWhen I do this, I start getting the following messages:\ncp: omitting directory `Tag' \ncp: omitting directory `Test' \ncp: omitting directory `Text' \ncp: omitting directory `TimeSync' \ncp: omitting directory `Tool' \ncp: omitting directory `Translate' \ncp: omitting directory `Uri' \ncp: omitting directory `Validate' \n\nand so on...\nWhy do I get these messages ?\n\nA: By default, cp copies only the direct files in, and not subdirectories in the directory. The message cp: omitting directory 'directory' warns you that the mentioned directory is not copied.\nTo do so, specify the -r (or --recursive) option:\nsudo cp -r ~/Transfers/ZendFramework-1.11.4-minimal/library/Zend/* ~/public_html/cmsk.dev/library/\n\nThe manual page (command: man cp) contains an overview of the available options.\n\nA: The message means that cp hasn't copied the directories listed. This is the default behaviour for cp - only files are copied normally, regardless of if you are specifying them explicitely or using *. If you want directories copying use the -r switch which means \"recursive\".\n\nA: When you are copying a directory like:\ncp dir1 copy_of_dir1\n\nYou're only and exactly copying the dir1 itself and not the files within it, so at the end you will end up with a new directory structure while the structure does not exist.  \nIn other words after it has been copied it will say that my contents is file1, file2, etc; However these files has not been copied and thus does not exist in it.\nSo to fix this issue that may came up cp by default does not copy the directories and skips them unless you specify -r option which copies all the files recursively too.\n\nA: Couple of things here which need to check:\n\n\n*\n\n*Don't use sudo. You don't need it, you already have the permissions to write stuff in your own home directory.\n\n*You can easily view hidden files and directories in the graphical file manager by selecting View/Show Hidden Files from the menu. Or by pressing Ctrl - H.\n\n*You need to use the -R option in the cp command to copy a directory and it's contents.\n\n*/home isn't your home directory. /home/username is. So you are probably trying to copy from wrong place.\n\n*The shell is case sensitive, so ~/downloads and ~/Downloads are two different things.\n\nA: The reason it says omitting directory is because cp and all copy utilities, that I know of, create a list of files and sub-directories to be copied before starting to copy the files. When the --recursive options is missing, sub-directories get bumped off this list. As such, omitting refers to removal from the copy list, not from your source media. I believe this addresses the meaning of the message.\n\nA: The cp command is used to copy files and directory, not the nested directories,\nif you want to copy nesting directories then you can add -r after that, where -r means recursive.\nSyntax that you can follow (running as root):\ncp -r /source/dir/* /destination/ \n\nor \ncp --recursive /source/dir/* /destination/\n\n\nA: Suppose you have two directories 'Tag' & 'Test'\nIf you want to copy 'Tag' directory to 'Test' directory use command \n$ : cp -r Tag Test (case sensitive)\n\nMostly Problem will be solved with above code if not and you get below message like\ncp: omitting directory `Tag' \ncp: omitting directory `Test'\n\nthen add some files in 'Tag' directory and then copy those to 'Test' .

Now in Unity if I click in the launcher will take me to one of the documents, I suppose is taking me to the last one I was editing or reading, and then I have to click in the Window Menu to choose a different document (this workflow is very inefficient).\nI wasn't able to figure out the way of going to a specific document.\nCould somebody help me?\n\nA: For this situation I would use the \"Spread Mode\" keyboard short-cut.\nPress the Super + W key (i.e. the windows symbol button and the w key)\nThis will display all open windows on the same screen.  You can then click which ever document you now wish to work on.\n\nA: When you are working with another program, the first time that you click on the openoffice icon, all open documents should go to the foreground (this is only useful if you have not maximised documents). If you click on the icon again, it will show you all open the documents. You can choose there which one you want to focus.\nIf you are already in OpenOffice, clicking on its icon in unity should open the document selection window.\n\nA: 3 other solutions, I like the Super+W key suggestion, did not know that one!\nALT TAB will allow you to quickly choose the file you need. Keep ALT key Pressed, The TAB key is to select, release when the correct document is selected.\nor\nOn the menu bar of OpenOffice click Window, and choose the document you need.\nor\nRight click on each document title bar and send it to a different workplace. Then Use CTRL ALT Left arrow key, or CTRL ALT Right arrow key to move between workplaces.

For example I want C to map to J, but Ctrl + C to remain as Ctrl + C.\nThe dvorak-qwerty program is supposed to do this, but does not work for me.\nDesired behaviour seems to occur in the terminal and with foreign language layouts.\n\nA: Please see this bug and the long and heated discussion around it: https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=162726\nThe behaviour you want was actually the default behaviour before and was considered a bug by people using the Dvorak layout...\nPS: That it works in gnome-terminal is considered a bug...\n\nA: Reported on Launchpad as bug 794510. Reported on GNOME Bugzilla as bug 652104.\n\nNo option to use Qwerty hotkeys in alternative Latin keyboard layouts\nSome users prefer to use an alternative Latin layout such as Dvorak to increase their typing speed. Many of these users prefer to use the original Qwerty keyboard shortcuts which are conveniently positioned (e.g. Ctrl: C-Copy, V-Paste, S-Save). An option should be provided to use Qwerty hotkeys with alternative layouts.\nQwerty hotkeys are already used in the terminal and in non-latin keyboard layouts.

I'm having a problem. I have set an environment variable in /etc/environment using BOOST_LIBRARYDIR=\"/usr/local/lib/boost/release\".\necho $BOOST_LIBRARYDIR correctly echoes the value to the terminal. However, if I execute echo $BOOST_LIBRARYDIR in a script using ./test.sh it shows the env variable as empty. As I understand it, it should be set also for child processes?\n\nA: If you want an environment variable to be passed to children you must export it.  To verify if it is exported use the env command.  The safest way to do this is as follows.\nBOOST_LIBRARYDIR=\"/usr/local/lib/boost/release\"; export BOOST_LIBRARYDIR\n\nNewer shells like bash and ksh accept the simpler form. \nexport BOOST_LIBRARYDIR =\"/usr/local/lib/boost/release\"\n\n\nA: Since /etc/environment seems to be sourced from /etc/init/gdm.conf, I think you can substitute your line with \nexport BOOST_LIBRARYDIR=\"/usr/local/lib/boost/release\"\n\n", "Q: Shortcut to hide libnotify I was wondering if it is possible to make an shortcut to hide all those Notify Bubbles (libnotify) for some time.

So if it is possible, will be really cool :)\nThanks :)\n\nA: I dont think there is a direct way to disable and re-enable the notifications.  \nHowever you could write two scripts which you could have on your desktop or a dock such as awn/docky etc.  The scripts would remove the execute permission from the executable that is run to display the notification.

Can I get the ip from another computer connected to my ubuntu one account? I know that I can have this with dyndns but being able to get the ip of every computer connected to my ubuntu account is easier than creating one more account on another site and configuring yet another daemon....\n\nA: Do you need to get it when that computer starts or constantly check the ip?\nTo to it when the computer starts, you can create a script that writes the public ip to a file in the Ubuntu One folder. \nOn the computer who's IP you want to find out\n1.

Your browser\n  supports WebGL, but WebGL is not\n  initializing properly\n\nHow can I get this to work?\n\nA: In order to check whether your browser supports WebGL, visit\nhttp://get.webgl.org/\nLinux and WebGL have teething problems, and in many cases it just does not work.\nWhenever there is a support question, you need to provide \n\n\n*\n\n*what graphics card you have\n\n*which driver you are using (mostly if they are the free/closed ones for ATI or NVidia). Newer Intel graphics drivers may be supported, older are quite unlikely.\n\n\nIn most cases you can force your browser to use WebGL; follow the link that it given when you visit http://get.webgl.org/\n\nA: In Chromium (or Google Chrome) you can type about:flags and search (ctrl + f) to WebGL. Activate it then restart your browser.\n\nA: It is possible for the WebGL support to become broken by a misbehaving WebGL app.  When this happens, WebGL apps will not be able to run.\nThis can be fixed by restarting all instances of your browser.\nA relatively non-destructive way of doing this in Chromium (so you don't lose open pages) is to go to about:flags and disable WebGL (by selecting 'Enable'), then 'Relaunch Now', then re-enable WebGL and relaunch again.\nThere's probably a more straightforward way, but I am not aware of it.\n", "Q: Any open source data analysis software around?

I am trying to install Ubuntu Natty beta 2 32bit with WUBI, but whenever I try to install it always tries to download 64 bit version.\nHow do I ensure that it downloads 32 bit instead of 64 bit?\n\nA: Wubi chooses 64-bit automatically if you have a 64-bit CPU. You can override it with the command line option --32bit. This option is required even if you download the 32-bit desktop CD ISO yourself and place it in the same folder as wubi.exe before running.\nSee the Wubi guide for more info.\nWhen you are installing a beta version of Ubuntu, the CD images and therefore the checksums change frequently, so even if you have the 32 bit ISO it may still reject it. If you are running from a CD, disconnect from the internet or use --skipmd5check to bypass this check (in this case you should make sure you have previously run the md5 check yourself). This is not recommended for non-beta installs, in which case you should let Wubi run the MD5 check.\n\nA: Put the 32bit ISO in the same directory as Wubi.exe. You can also install magicdisk / deamontools and mount the ISO (Windows is primitive and cannot do this alone), and run the installer there.\nI suggest you resize your partitions and make free space for Ubuntu to install a real Ubuntu. This will run better as it will not be affected by NTFS fragmenting the wubi disk file but is also far easier to troubleshoot as you can boot to live CD and access the partitions with ease.\n\nA: It worked after disabling internet connection and then having ISO file and wubi file in the same folder.\n\nA: You can use the following method:\nOFFLINE INSTALLATION:\n\n\n*\n\n*DISABLE INTERNET\n\n*MOUNT 32BIT ISO IN WINDOWS VIRTUAL DRIVE (no additional software is required in the case of windows 8)\n\n*COPY THE wubi.exe TO SOME OTHER DRIVE; FOR EXMAPLE E:\\WUBI-INSTALLER\n\n*OPEN COMMAND PROMPT (ADMIN)\n\n*CHANGE DIRECTORY TO E:\\WUBI-INSTALLER (i.e. the location in your PC where the installer is copied)\n\n*USE THE FOLLOWING COMMAND TO TARGET TO 32BIT MOUNTED IMAGE:\n  wubi.exe --force-wubi --32bit\n\n(with this step, the installer will automatically detect and use the mounted ISO image)\nCOMPLETE THE INSTALLATION\nIMPORTANT NOTES:- USE THE wubi.exe FROM THE SAME ISO PACKAGE WHICH YOU'RE USING FOR THE INSTALLATION. Using this method, you can install the 32 bit version of ubuntu inside windows using the downloaded ISO image.\nhave a nice day\nsunny\n\nA: This is a bug. Actually I also tried to download and I downloaded 32 bit and it becomes 64 bit amd. But I am sure that my computer has 32 bit. It drives me crazy. So, finally, I saw the answer and will try to disconnect from internet as well.\n", "Q: Can I unlock Mac folders from a USB stick? I use a Macbook. The folders appear to be locked with a lock icon( like Music, Video etc.). The folders like documents seem to be working fine. I can't do anything on my mac as it is not booting but i need to take the data out of it. Can I do it from a Ubuntu Live USB stick? \n\nA: Ubuntu can access HFS+ which Mac uses. If you run:\ngksudo nautilus\n\n(I assume Gnome desktop), then you may get write access to the partition(s) and can then retrieve your data. I suggest you make a copy and put it somewhere safe.\n\nA: You might not have the right permissions to access them. You can still get at them using sudo though.\nSo say if you wanted to get into /media/MacOSDrive/Music/ or something then type:\ncd /media/MacOSDrive/\nls\n\nAnd you should see the folders listed that you can't get into. Try getting into the music directory:\ncd Music\n\nAnd it will say no in some way, then use sudo,\nsudo cd Music\n\nThen you should be able to get in, use ls to see the files in there.\n\nA: As Slipstream has answered you can use root privileges to access and copy the contents through terminal. All you have to do is boot from a Ubuntu live USB/CD and use following commands:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open terminal via Applications > Accessories > Terminal; use sudo su to gain root user privileges and ls /media/MacOSDrive to list the contents. After MacOSDrive you can append /Documents/ or any such directory name to list out their contents.\n\n*Once you are sure about the contents you need to copy use sudo cp <source drive, say /media/MacOSDrive/Documents> -av <destination drive, say /media/an_external_drive>, where a stands for all contents and v for verbose mode, which lists out what is being copied file by file.\n\n\nHope it helps.\n\nA: I believe this thread will solve the problem for you. Just follow the steps listed in comment three. This is the same solution I used when I had this problem on my macbook. It's a more permanent solution then going through the terminal as root all the time.\n", "Q: Wubi installation I have downloaded Ubuntu beta 2 for installation.

Be sure your backups are up to date in case of catastrophe and for god's sake run on the mains power when you do it.\nThis will not only give you a faster OS (Wubi uses a file on crappy NTFS as the Ubuntu drive), but is also drastically simpler to fix if things go wrong as you can very easily use the live CD to access the partitions.\n", "Q: Different docks on different workspaces, or configure awn to behave differently on different workspaces I would like to have different settings for the dock behavior for different workspaces, or more likely i would like the dock that i use now , awn (Avant window navigator) to show up in just 3 of the four workspaces i have.\nSo the question is : can i run different instances of awn one on each workspace\nor can i run it just on one work space and maybe use something else like cario for the next workspace.\nany ideas?\n\nA: you can edit a script that change your AWN's gconfs, for example change your dock behavior from \"intellihide/panel-mode\" to \"autohide\" so you no longer see it..\nthen you can add it to your dock as a \"simple launcher\" entry..\nthis\nis a script i've done to move my wingpanel and my dock to the left, resizing them to 20px and forcing them to auto hide.. it works like a switch so re-launching it makes everything back to normal..\nhope it helps..\n", "Q: How to programmatically swap the caps lock and esc keys? I am a heavy Vim user and one of the first things I do when I start working on a clean ubuntu installation is to swap the caps lock and esc keys to reduce hand movements over the keyboard.\nSo far I have been doing it through the keyboard configuration dialog, but I am now writting a set of scripts that will set Ubuntu up the way I like and I have not been able to find a scriptable or programmable way to change this configuration item.\nI am not looking for options that swap the keys at any other level than gnome itself, so what I am looking for is for a way to script this change and have it appear in the keyboard configuration that I used to use, should I decide to revert it manually in the future.\n\nA: You can do this through the GUI by open the Keyboard Preferences control panel (under System -> Preferences), and select the Layout tab.  Click on the Options... button to open the layout options dialog.  Expand the Caps Lock key behaviour section and select Swap ESC and Caps Lock.\nThere are a few ways you could script this kind of thing.\nDirectly via Xkb\nWe can make the change directly with the following:\nsetxkbmap -option caps:swapescape\n\nYou can disable all the current layout options (which will return caps lock to its default behaviour) with:\nsetxkbmap -option ''\n\nVia GConf\nThe keyboard preferences control panel stores its configuration via gconf, with the layout actually being applied by gnome-settings-daemon.  Therefore, you can cause gnome-settings-daemon to adjust the layout by updating gconf yourself.\nThe relevant setting in this case appears to be /desktop/gnome/peripherals/keyboard/kbd/options.  So you can set the option with:\ngconftool-2 --set /desktop/gnome/peripherals/keyboard/kbd/options \\\n    --type list --list-type string \\\n    '[caps<tab>caps:swapescape]'\n\nIn the above, <tab> should be a literal tab character rather than spaces.  You can disable the behaviour again by setting the gconf key to an empty list.\n", "Q: How can I install TeXMaker 3?

Time and effort needed left aside, it will likely result in a very suboptimal, unstable system. Just don't do it, reinstall the apps from Fedora.\n(Reasons start with different file system trees and configuration methods between distributions, and probably won't stop with differing file and library versions within individual software packages.)\n\nA: Not going to happen. You can easily copy over configs without issue but even if you did retain EVERY deb file you ever downloaded (doubtful) then I am not sure they would work. I suggest you post on a Fedora forum as Fedora is not supported here.\n", "Q: How to use 12voip.com (Betamax) SIP service for calling and sendingSMS?

This might be a bug but it might just be an undocumented \"feature\". I'm asking because I want to know.\nEdit: This is now also filed as a bug.\nEdit: Here's a strace of gnome-panel.\nUpgraded to Natty from Maverick today with the intention of keeping my panel-based Gnome2 setup. I've already asked if that's possible and it does appear that's the case.\nMy problem is on loading the panels, I get a ton of errors from very default applets like the Window list, Notification Area and Clock. Upon further investigation, I don't appear to be able to even add these types of applet. They're missing from the Add to Panel dialogue.\nIs there a package I need to install to get these applets back?\nHere's what I see on boot:\n\n\nA: Well this has been an adventure. I had seen this MintForum thread before but ignored it mainly because it was talking about bonobo (which is frankly a silly word) but also because the applet in discussion was the MintMenu.\nI decided to go back there today and actually read it. plumm's post has given me a few clues and has actually got a few things working (after some modification). Here's what I'm doing. Until I've got everything back this post is a work in progress.\nFirst you have to locate your bonobo-activation-config file:\n# locate bonobo-activation-config\n/etc/bonobo-activation/bonobo-activation-config.xml\n\nThen we find where all the applets' bonobo-server-item-configuration files are:\n# locate bonobo/server | grep GNOME\n/usr/lib/bonobo/servers/GNOME_BrightnessApplet.server\n/usr/lib/bonobo/servers/GNOME_DictionaryApplet.server\n/usr/lib/bonobo/servers/GNOME_GtikApplet.server\n/usr/lib/bonobo/servers/GNOME_InhibitApplet.server\n/usr/lib/bonobo/servers/GNOME_Magnifier.server\n/usr/lib/bonobo/servers/GNOME_Moniker_std.server\n/usr/lib/bonobo/servers/GNOME_SeahorseApplet.server\n/usr/lib/bonobo/servers/GNOME_TSClientApplet.server\n/usr/local/lib/bonobo/servers/GNOME_ClockApplet_Factory.server\n/usr/local/lib/bonobo/servers/GNOME_FishApplet_Factory.server\n/usr/local/lib/bonobo/servers/GNOME_NotificationAreaApplet.server\n/usr/local/lib/bonobo/servers/GNOME_Wncklet_Factory.server\n\nThen we put the two together, creating new xml <items> in the bonobo-activation-config.xml.

Then you can add the existing applets\nIf you cannot live without the ubuntu indicator applets try re-installing them. They have been causing errors for me in the gnome classic session. so i got rid of them.\nRight now, i have a situation where even unity is creating a lot of issues for me. i am thinking of installing gnome 3 and check how it fares. if everything fails i will have to do a clean install.\n", "Q: Project Hamster Time Traker, lack of Unity support I used to use the hamster time tracker. \nIt is a wonderful application, easy to use and simple.

Is there any free software to create interactive panoramas (360º, like this one) in Ubuntu?\nEdit:  I would need not only a way to create a static panorama (i.e, a JPG file, for instance), but also a way to convert it to some interactive format (swf, mov....) or some way to implement it in a web page so that it can be panned, rotated, etc. (zoomed would also be nice, but is not strictly required).\n\nA: Hugin  ( Click To Install )\n\n\nHugin is a panorama photo stitching program. Essentially, Hugin is a GUI frontend for Panorama Tools. Stitching is accomplished by using several overlapping photos taken from the same location, and using control points to align and transform the photos so that they can be blended together to form a larger image. Hugin allows for the easy creation of control points between two images, optimization of the image transforms, and much more.\n\n", "Q: How to recursively remove .svn metadata folders?

I have many files with .abc extension and want to change them to .edefg\nHow to do this from command line ?\nI have a root folder with many sub-folders, so the solution should work recursively.\n\nA: This will do the required task if all the files are in the same folder\nrename 's/.abc$/.edefg/' *.abc\n\nTo rename the files  recursively use this:\nfind /path/to/root/folder -type f -name '*.abc' -print0 | xargs -0 rename 's/.abc$/.edefg/'\n\n\nA: Another portable way:\nfind /the/path -depth -type f -name \"*.abc\" -exec sh -c 'mv -- \"$1\" \"$(dirname \"$1\")/$(basename \"$1\" .abc).edefg\"' _ '{}' \\;\n\n\nA: # Rename all *.txt to *.text\nfor f in *.txt; do \nmv -- \"$f\" \"${f%.txt}.text\"\ndone\n\nAlso see the entry on why you shouldn't parse ls.\nEdit: if you have to use basename your syntax would be:\nfor f in *.txt; do\nmv -- \"$f\" \"$(basename \"$f\" .txt).text\"\ndone\n\nhttps://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/19654/changing-extension-to-multiple-files\n\nA: I'd use the mmv command\nfrom the package of the same name:\nmmv ';*.abc' '#1#2.edefg'\n\nThe ; matches zero or more */ and corresponds to #1 in the replacement. The * corresponds to #2. The non-recursive version would be\nmmv '*.abc' '#1.edefg'\n\n\nA: One problem with recursive renames is that whatever method you use to locate the files, it passes the whole path to rename, not just the file name. That makes it hard to do complex renames in nested folders.\nI use find's -execdir action to solve this problem. If you use -execdir instead of -exec, the specified command is run from the subdirectory containing the matched file. So, instead of passing the whole path to rename, it only passes ./filename. That makes it much easier to write the regex.\nfind /the/path -type f \\\n               -name '*.abc' \\\n               -execdir rename 's/\\.\\/(.+)\\.abc$/version1_$1.abc/' '{}' \\;\n\nIn detail:\n\n\n*\n\n*-type f means only look for files, not directories\n\n*-name '*.abc' means only match filenames that end in .abc\n\n*'{}' is the placeholder that marks the place where -execdir will insert the found path. The single-quotes are required, to allow it to handle file names with spaces and shell characters.\n\n*The backslashes after -type and -name are the bash line-continuation character. I use them to make this example more readable, but they are not needed if you put your command all on one line.\n\n*However, the backslash at the end of the -execdir line is required. It is there to escape the semicolon, which terminates the command run by -execdir. Fun!\n\n\nExplanation of the regex:\n\n\n*\n\n*s/ start of the regex\n\n*\\.\\/ match the leading ./ that -execdir passes in. Use \\ to escape the . and / metacharacters (note: this part vary depending on your version of find. See comment from user @apollo) \n\n*(.+) match the filename. The parentheses capture the match for later use\n\n*\\.abc escape the dot, match the abc\n\n*$ anchor the match at the end of the string\n\n*/ marks the end of the \"match\" part of the regex, and the start of the \"replace\" part\n\n*version1_ add this text to every file name\n\n*$1 references the existing filename, because we captured it with parentheses. If you use multiple sets of parentheses in the \"match\" part, you can refer to them here using $2, $3, etc.\n\n*.abc the new file name will end in .abc. No need to escape the dot metacharacter here in the \"replace\" section\n\n*/ end of the regex\n\n\nBefore\ntree --charset=ascii\n\n|-- a_file.abc\n|-- Another.abc\n|-- Not_this.def\n`-- dir1\n    `-- nested_file.abc\n\nAfter\ntree --charset=ascii\n\n|-- version1_a_file.abc\n|-- version1_Another.abc\n|-- Not_this.def\n`-- dir1\n    `-- version1_nested_file.abc\n\n\nHint: rename's -n option is useful. It does a dry run and shows you what names it will change, but does not make any changes.\n\nA: A portable way (which will work on any POSIX compliant system): \nfind /the/path -depth -name \"*.abc\" -exec sh -c 'mv \"$1\" \"${1%.abc}.edefg\"' _ {} \\;\n\nIn bash4, you can use globstar to get recursive globs (**):\nshopt -s globstar\nfor file in /the/path/**/*.abc; do\n  mv \"$file\" \"${file%.abc}.edefg\"\ndone\n\nThe (perl) rename command in Ubuntu can rename files using perl regular expression syntax, which you can combine with globstar or find:\n# Using globstar\nshopt -s globstar\nfiles=(/the/path/**/*.abc)  \n\n# Best to process the files in chunks to avoid exceeding the maximum argument \n# length. 100 at a time is probably good enough. \n# See http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/095\nfor ((i = 0; i < ${#files[@]}; i += 100)); do\n  rename 's/\\.abc$/.edefg/' \"${files[@]:i:100}\"\ndone\n\n# Using find:\nfind /the/path -depth -name \"*.abc\" -exec rename 's/\\.abc$/.edefg/' {} +\n\nAlso see http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/030 \n\nA: This is what I did and worked pretty just the way I wanted. I used the mv command. I had multiple .3gp files and I wanted to rename them all to .mp4\nHere's a short oneliner for it:\nfor i in *.3gp; do mv -- \"$i\" \"ren-$i.mp4\"; done\n\nWhich simply scans through the current directory, picks up all .3gp files, then renames (using the mv) into ren-name_of_file.mp4\n\nA: I found an easy way to achieve this. To change extensions of many files from jpg to pdf, use:\nfor file in /path/to; do mv $file $(basename -s jpg $file)pdf ; done\n\n\nA: Rename files and directories with find -execdir | rename\nIf you are going to rename both files and directories not simply with a suffix, then this is a good pattern:\nPATH=\"$(echo \"$PATH\" | sed -E 's/(^|:)[^\\/][^:]*//g')\" \\\n  find . -depth -execdir rename 's/findme/replaceme/' '{}' \\;\n\nThe awesome -execdir option does a cd into the directory before executing the rename command, unlike -exec.\n-depth ensure that the renaming happens first on children, and then on parents, to prevent potential problems with missing parent directories.\n-execdir is required because rename does not play well with non-basename input paths, e.g. the following fails:\nrename 's/findme/replaceme/g' acc/acc\n\nThe PATH hacking is required because -execdir has one very annoying drawback: find is extremely opinionated and refuses to do anything with -execdir if you have any relative paths in your PATH environment variable, e.g. ./node_modules/.bin, failing with:\n\nfind: The relative path ‘./node_modules/.bin’ is included in the PATH environment variable, which is insecure in combination with the -execdir action of find.  Please remove that entry from $PATH\n\nSee also: Why using the '-execdir' action is insecure for directory which is in the PATH?\n-execdir is a GNU find extension to POSIX. rename is Perl based and comes from the rename package. Tested in Ubuntu 18.10.\nRename lookahead workaround\nIf your input paths don't come from find, or if you've had enough of the relative path annoyance, we can use some Perl lookahead to safely rename directories as in:\ngit ls-files | sort -r | xargs rename 's/findme(?!.*\\/)\\/?$/replaceme/g' '{}'\n\nI haven't found a convenient analogue for -execdir with xargs: https://superuser.com/questions/893890/xargs-change-working-directory-to-file-path-before-executing/915686\nThe sort -r is required to ensure that files come after their respective directories, since longer paths come after shorter ones with the same prefix. \n", "Q: Upgrading from Ubuntu 10.10 to Kubuntu 11.04 How can I upgrade from Ubuntu 10.10 to Kubuntu 11.04(beta 2)? Also, how much problems should I expect in the beta?\n\nA: It shouldn't be too difficult. Switching to Kubuntu is simply a matter of running sudo tasksel kubuntu-desktop. Then, you can do a normal upgrade. It shouldn't be a problem, though of course who knows what problems you'll encounter in the beta.\nI don't agree with the advice to re-install. In my experience, there are only a few minor things that break during an upgrade, and re-installing and re-configuring takes a lot more time than fixing a few minor problems. I've upgraded though many releases without trouble. Admittedly, though, I always wait to upgrade until several weeks after the release to give time for bugs to get fixed.\n\nA: If I go by previous upgrade attempts in older versions of Ubuntu, I always had more problems than saved time. Although it is time consuming to reinstall all applications and redo some settings and customizations, it saves me time in the long run for a couple of reasons:\n\n\n*\n\n*I do not have all the crapware that I installed since the last main installation\n\n*I only have what I actually need and use, not everything else\n\n*Some drivers do not go well through an upgrade process and you can loose wireless or sound or whatever else.\n\n*When doing a re-install, it's also a good time to do a solid backup of all your files. When was your last backup ? \n\n\nIf everything is on a single partition, you may want to redistribute this on the next install. Like having /home mounted on its own partition, so you just re-connect it next time, as opposed to redo it all. Also, directories that can fill with log files, such as /var/messages or /var/logs could be on their own partition. If they fill in with errors, they will not crash your main disk.\n", "Q: Ruby IDE for Ubuntu \nPossible Duplicate:\nWhat IDEs are available for Ubuntu? \n\nI am in search of a light-weight RoR IDE for Ubuntu.

So forwarding=1 is probably turning getting addresses via autoconfiguration off.\n\nA: IPv6 addresses are not distributed via DHCP. But you can install radvd which distributes IPv6 addresses and also handles the routing if required. \nAfter installing via apt-get install radvd you can find example configuration files in /usr/share/doc/radvd/examples/\nAlso read /usr/share/doc/radvd/README.Debian.\n", "Q: Xine always starts muted I'm suffering from the issue that xine is always starting up muted so that I have to manually increase the volume. I tried all options (with Configuration experience level set to maximum). The startup audio volume is set to 60% and tried with restore volume level at startup both enabled and disabled as well as all other settings I could find.\nThis started already quite a while ago, I think with Ubuntu 8.04 and seems to be caused by Pulseaudio. Removing ~/.pulse helps and xine starts up non-muted once but further starts are muted again after the directory is recreated. It links to the /tmp folder which is a tmpfs RAM disk, so it is deleted at every reboot, but this doesn't \nThis happens on two installations on quite different computers (Acer Aspire 7720G Laptop and Dell Omniplex 745). I'm using the normal xine v0.99.6 and running Ubuntu 10.10 64bit.\nI tried googling it several times in the last two years but never found anything relevant.\nI thought it might be caused by an old wrongly updated pulseaudio config file, but it also happens with a fresh installation. The home directory is the same, but I deleted all pulseaudio related user config files I could find and this didn't changed anything.\nDeleting ~/.xine doesn't change anything apart of the Xine config window popping up at the first start afterwards. Running pulseaudio -k will make xine start officially muted (Volume at 0%) but with normal sound!\n\nA: I also found that audio.pulseaudio_device:auto also works. Perhaps anything explicit works, which would imply there's something wrong with the code that is supposed to set the default when there is no config file entry.\n\nA: Modify this string in the ~/.xine/config file:\n#audio.pulseaudio_device:\n\nto\naudio.pulseaudio_device:pulseaudio\n\n", "Q: Sitecom Wireless Network USB Micro Adapter Problem I have problem with Sitecom Wireless Network USB Micro Adapter 300N WL-364.

I have four partitions on my hard-drive: C, E, F and G. Partitions C and G are NTFS and I installed Ubuntu using Wubi through Windows 7. Probably I installed it on the partition G, where Windows 7 is also installed. I guess I created a new partition within G for Ubuntu and it was a minimum 3.5 GB installation.\nFrom Ubuntu, I want to check on which partition I installed it and how much space is left. How to do this? I also want to install any Ubuntu package that can resize the partition by taking the free space from another partition.\n\nA: Wubi does not install Ubuntu into a real partition but instead resides in some files on your NTFS partition. I can't really say how you can find out where your files are located but you might be interested in Wubi: How do I resize the virtual disks?.\n\nA: It's probably simplest to mount each partition in turn and look for a filesystem containing an ubuntu/disks directory.\n\nA: The following commands show how to determine the host partition, and the space used:\nbcbc@ubuntu:~$ mount | grep '/host'\n/dev/sda3 on /host type fuseblk (rw,nosuid,nodev,relatime,user_id=0,group_id=0,allow_other,blksize=4096)\nbcbc@ubuntu:~$ df -h\nFilesystem            Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on\n/dev/loop0            5.0G  4.0G  739M  85% /\nnone                  494M  672K  493M   1% /dev\nnone                  501M  336K  500M   1% /dev/shm\nnone                  501M  256K  500M   1% /var/run\nnone                  501M     0  501M   0% /var/lock\n/dev/sda3              20G   12G  8.0G  60% /host\n\nIn the above, my host partition is /dev/sda3 and the space remaining on the virtual disk (/dev/loop0) is 739MB, the space remaining on /host is 8GB.\nYou cannot determine the \"drive designation\" that Windows uses for /dev/sda3 from within Wubi. But if you go to Windows, then the drive will contain the \"ubuntu\" folder in the root. e.g. G:\\ubuntu\nFor resizing the virtual disks, please refer to the Wubi Guide\n", "Q: How to make the Unity Launcher to be transparent?

How do I stop this from starting up? I want to use vidalia so I can monitor whats going on.  \n\nA: Newer versions of Tor have a file /etc/default/tor.vidalia. It contains three lines:\nif [ -x /usr/bin/vidalia ]; then\n        RUN_DAEMON=yes\nfi\n\nYou can change the option to no. This will prevent from starting as daemon. Instead Tor will now start when you start Vidalia.\n\nA: I think the condition is unnecessary.\nIf you look in /etc/default/tor the tor.vidalia file is not sourced unless that same test passes.\nThis snipit solved part of my problem, but not all of them, so, DISCLAIMER: I still don't have a working setup.\n\nA: try this:\nGo to Settings > Advanced > Tor Control and checked Use TCP Connection (ControlPort) with the address 127.0.0.1:9051 .\nFor me worked fine \n\nA: My solution to this problem was that TOR daemon was already running which Vidalia didnt like.\nps aux | grep tor\n\nFollowed by a\nsudo service tor stop\n\nOr a \nsudo killall tor\n\nThen starting vidalia produced no error.\nI think also adding qbi's tor.vidalia file to start a daemon also helped.\n\nA: I believe this answer (found here ) can be useful.

Is it possible to set up Banshee to sync with my Ubuntu One music that is stored in the cloud?\nIf I upload all my music to Ubuntu One from my desktop, will I then be able to sync Banshee with that cloud and play all my music on my laptop, without having to \"download\" all the music to my laptop?\nCan Banshee handle the cloud music as if it was stored locally? \n\nA: The answer is unfortunately \"no\" (or at least not yet).\n\nA: It would be possibly for someone to write a Banshee extension which does this; Ubuntu One provides a music streaming API (documentation for which is at https://one.ubuntu.com/developer/music/stream_music/cloud/). No-one has so far written such an extension, but it's possible to do so, and I'd be happy to provide help to anyone wishing to do so.\n", "Q: How to use loose focus feature of Xserver? I want one window to loose mouse focus (its a game, and alt-tab doesnt work as it should).\nThere is this interesting commit that i reached with searching and reading, but dont know how to use DeaGrb feature.\nhttp://cgit.freedesktop.org/~daniels/xserver/commit/?h=input-next&id=ff4efa75fba16c099295b0cc6a5b9e44386b8427\nEdit1:\nThere are some applications(games mostly) which exclusively grab mouse focus, and if you press alt-tab, your mouse focus wont switch to another window, I want to force such applications to release all focus they have, i think that AllowDeactivateGrabs config var in X server should have similar effect, but it is deprecated...\nEdit2: @poolie, no it is not duplicate question, it is releated, but definetely not duplicate\n\nA: I'm not an X expert, but I don't think that patch is really relevant to having different focus behaviour between different windows.\nIf you are asking for just some windows to use focus-follows-mouse, you can probably configure that into a sufficiently flexible window manager.  It might be possible in Compiz; it's almost certainly possible in Sawfish.\nIf your problem is just that the game uses Alt-tab for its own purposes, you can just remove that from the Ubuntu Keyboard Shortcuts configuration window.\n", "Q: Dependecies not met --  language-selector uri@uri-MS-7267:~$ LANG=c sudo dpkg --configure -a\n[sudo] password for uri: \nSetting up language-selector-common (0.6.7) ...\ndpkg: error processing language-selector-common (--configure):\nsubprocess installed post-installation script returned error exit status 2\ndpkg: dependency problems prevent configuration of language-selector:\nlanguage-selector depends on language-selector-common (= 0.6.7); however:\nPackage language-selector-common is not configured yet.\ndpkg: error processing language-selector (--configure):\ndependency problems - leaving unconfigured\nProcessing triggers for python-central ...\nErrors were encountered while processing:\nlanguage-selector-common\nlanguage-selector\n\nWhy am I getting this?

This is a question in general. Sometimes when using Natty, the interface freezes like the keyboard works but the mouse does respond. In which case pressing Ctrl+Alt+F1 puts me at the terminal. However I do not know how to load the GUI and Unity and continue using Ubuntu. At present I just shutdown properly and restart.\nI have no expertise in this regard, which is probably why some of the terms I use could be wrong. Please correct me if necessary.\nHow do I restart the Xserver or GUI(Gnome and Unity) when I press Ctrl+Alt+F1? \n\nA: There are a few ways to do this.  My personal favourite is to login to the F1 text console as yourself. Then type\nsudo service gdm restart\n\nThis should kill you previous X server and restart it.  Sometimes it fails to kill properly, but it will start another X server on tty8 (CTRL + ALT + F8)\n\nA: You can restart X in 2 different ways staying at graphical tty (i.e. tty7).  \n\n\n*\n\n*First you can try  \nCtrl + Alt + Backspace \n(this shortcut isn't enabled by default. To enable, go to Menu > System > Preferences > Keyboard > Layout > Options > Key sequence to kill X server).  \n\n\n\n*\n\n*If it doens't work you can use the kernel to do this. The \"shortcut\" is:  \nSys Rq + Alt + K \n(or for laptops:  \nFn + Sys Rq + Ctrl + Alt + K)  \nFor reference, see Wikipedia: Magic SysRq key.\n\nA: If you can use ALT+F2 you can try \"unity --replace\" OR \"unity --reset-icons\"\n", "Q: How can I make 'man' more gui friendly? When I type man bash it shows the info in the terminal itself.\nHow do I tell \"man\" to open up the info in gedit instead? Is this possible?\n\nA: Use this function in .bashrc:\nman () { yelp \"man:$@\"; }\n\nSource\n\nA: Simply enter the following in the terminal:\nman bash >/tmp/t;gedit /tmp/t\n\nThat will create a temporary file with the contents of the man page and open it with gedit.\n\nA: Better yet, have man format it in HTML and open it in firefox\n#!/bin/bash\n# open a man page in firefox\n\n# loop through all parameters in order\nfor i\ndo\n    # if the manpage was found, spawn it in a browser window\n    man -f \"$i\" > /dev/null && coproc man --html=firefox \"$i\"\ndone\n\n\nA: If you don't want to use a shell: hit alt+f2 and enter yelp man:bash.\nA command history is also available, and you can choose any manpage by replacing man:bash with the manpage you need.\n\nA: As well as opening the man page in gedit (like the other answers have demonstrated), you can also make a pdf of the man page (as first noted in this article) and then display it in evince. (You need ps2pdf and evince installed). The pdf file is created in your present working directory and is retained after evince is closed. \nSimply modify the command below according to the man page that you want and change the file names or else the resulting pdf files will be overwritten. Here is an example for dpkg:\nman -t dpkg | ps2pdf - dpkg.pdf && evince dpkg.pdf\n\nHowever, it is probably much more useful to construct a function. You could add the following function to your .bashrc or .bash_aliases (assuming you have evince and ps2pdf installed; the latter is in the ghostscript package):\nmikman() { man -t \"$1\" | ps2pdf - \"$1\".pdf && setsid evince \"$1\".pdf; }\n\nAfter adding the function, you have to run . .bashrc (or . .bash_aliases) to source your configuration files, or restart the terminal for it to take effect.\nCall the function with the name of any program that has a manpage, such as mikman dpkg, and it will carry out the commands and launch the manpage as a pdf. Launching the manpage as a pdf in your pdf reader gives you a very useful gui wherein search tools and the like can be utilised.\n\nA: On a case-by-case basis you can do:\nman mount > mount.txt\nThe .txt file will be in your current directory.\nman mount > mount.txt && gedit mount.txt\nwill open the file in gedit.\n\nA: You can browse man pages on-line http://manpages.ubuntu.com/ or install dwww package and browse all documentation off-line (http://localhost/dwww). See description of dwww package and/or read man dwww after installation.\nYou may be also interested in browsing package contents – install dpkg-www package and do the same: See description of dpkg-www package and/or read man dpkg-www after installation. Start dpkg-www or browse http://localhost/cgi-bin/dpkg.\n\nA: This will create a temporary file with the manual page for bash in your home directory entitled \"man\" and open it with gedit. As soon as you close gedit the file will be erased too. Just replace bash with whatever man page you want to open.\nman bash >> ~/man && gedit ~/man && rm ~/man\n\nHope this helps :)\n", "Q: How can I return from a new release to an older-release? \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow to roll back Ubuntu to a previous version? \n\nI really don't like 11.04. \nIs there any way to revert back to 10.10?\n\nA: If it's the GUI that you don't like about 11.04, then you can just revert to the classic GNOME interface (instead of the new Unity interface), rather than downgrading.\nTo do that, before you enter your password on the login screen, select 'Ubuntu Classic' as the session type.\n\nA: Yes.

Following on from an excellent answer provided by user Gilles, I'd like to ask whether there's a file system particularly well-suited for fairly heavy torrent use.\nSoon I'll be setting up an Ubuntu box with:\n\n\n*\n\n*/                [ext4]\n\n*/home            [ext4]\n\n*/media/data      [ext4]\n\n*/media/torrents  [?]\n\n\nNormally I'd make the /media/torrents partition ext4 without considering other options. However, in light of the information linked to above, perhaps there's a better alternative.\nThe proposed /media/torrents partition will be read and written to 24/7 but will only ever reach ~85% of the partition's capacity.\n\nA: Ext4 will handle it just fine, which is basically while Gilles said.  There also is little to no benefit to breaking the disk into 4 partitions.  You most likely will be better off with at most / and /home partitions.\n\nA: Short answer:  Use Ext2 on a torrent cache partition.  Also use the following mount options: noatime,nodiratime,nosuid,noguid,noexec\nLong answer, well... dare ye read it?\n(Also, this forum SEVERELY botched the nice formatting and spacing... thanks)\nIf you are able to, I would suggest you split your drive into two primary partitions.  I know of a setup which is working well that has done this on an old laptop with a 160 GB HDD.  The HDD is split 60GB mounted / with the system all loaded on it.  The second partition is 100GB, mounted to the first at point /tor .  The reason the frist partition is so large is this laptop is also hosting Deluge, CouchPotato, SickRage, HeadPhones, and Emby.  These use up a fair amount of cache for metadata downloads (for the 4TB attached USB drive of media)\nThe Torrents directory /tor will require high amounts of random reads and writes, to about half of its contents, simultaneously, all the time....  Until an SSD gets loaded into the second drive bay it will be limited to sharing this horrendous load with the server portion.  \nEXT4 is a JOURNALING file system, which means it tracks all those extra little changes, writes 'em down.  BUT, you could really care less about this feature, any checksum features, anything which records the 'modified' date each write that occurs to a file, just adds to the I/O count, increasing lag.  You don't want redundancy, nor do you worry much about data integrity or longevity.  There is a setting in most torrent applications which re-checks the group of files it believes it has just completed, for errors, before moving those completed files to a \"finished\" folder (or, another drive).  For Torrents, you will be GLAD to REDUCE THE SYSTEM LOAD by switching this second partition to a DIFFERENT file system (which I am presently looking into for you), AND additionally there are more options you can use.\nWhen you are partitioning Ubuntu for the first time on a computer, or a new drive for example, you can choose how that partition or drive is used.  Partition Type: Ext2.  2? not 4? you ask?  Well, 2 is non-journaled.  3 and 4 are.  Plus I googled a thing... http://www.linux-magazine.com/Online/Features/Filesystems-Benchmarked so check it up.  These values are not true in every case, but for what we need it is pretty great.  We need HIGH throughput of SMALL RANDOM writes. Ignore the first graph, it is reads, and sequential at that.  Second graph, Ext2 is right up there (only thing I would suggest is faster would be the XFS).  Sorry look at the FOURTH graph, my bad, second graph is of SEQUENTIAL WRITES (which while tormenting you will NEVER have), Instead, graph 4 shows a comparison of 32MB RANDOM WRITES.  Which is EXACTLY what you want the fastest performing drive on this list for (And for sequential reads when it is completed a download and about to move it).  \nI will say I was considering tying to figure out how to mount a SWAP partition in a similar fashion to how it works.\nNow its down to the little things, all the tiny extra IOs that don't make any difference when doing normal filesystem operations.  DATES.  \"Last Modified\" or \"Last Accessed\" and \"Last Saved\" and \"Last written to by\" and so on and so on.  Each time your torrent client flushes the RAM cache to disk, all of those files which just received a 500kb-4MB chunk, need to update those four dates, and your SUID (user ID) and (guID) group ID.  And guess what?  your drive (if its Advanced Format), has either 512KB sectors, or it has 4196KB Sectors, which means if something in this sector changes, it will re-write the ENTIRE sector.  (or maybe I am confusing it with partial fills of sectors, if so apologies).  But basically your single write of 500ish KB of data, now has to update 5 pieces of metadata spread over the file or drive (fragmentation), and EACH of those 5 pieces needs the arm/head to find its location, read the original data, send it to the processor, have it processed, modified, and returned, then re-written to the disk, on EACH OF THOSE 5 EXTRA SECTORS.  So how do we stop this?  I am not sure, in the mount point options but there is probably an option.  As far as a NEW UBUNTU setup goes, go into the \"Mount Options\", and select the following:\nnoatime - no access time - do not update inode access times at each access\nnodiradate - no directory access time - do not update directory inode access times\nrelatime (I do not know what this option does)\nnodev Do not set this, I think it basically puts a symbolic link in every other drive, at that same directory structure location, and basically gives them the go-ahead to redirect all their writes to said symlink file to this drive you are mounting.  And vice-versa.  But could be wrong.\nnosuid - Ignore set-user-identifier or set-group-identifier bits (useful if you have two daemons running as separate users that need a file passed between them)\nnoexec - do not allow the execution of any binaries (This is a good safety idea, but if you are downloading much software rather than movies and or tv, music, then I suggest you don't use this as you will quickly get annoyed at it).  Great for nullifying many threats to automated download systems though.\nro - ....you don't want this\nsync - I believe has to do with paired, spanned, or arrayed volumes over multiple drive,s it will try to read_write things in proportionate cycles\nusrquota - thankfully if the torrent partition fills up 100% the drive is still accessible and doesn't lock up entirely, so we don't need this option.\ngrpquota - same as above, not needed\nusr_xattr - http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/xenial/man5/attr.5.html (Extended Attributes)\nKeep your files close to the root of the drive or partition, shorter paths mean less path lengths, means shorter indexes, and possibly (not noticeably) quicker I/O times.\nGreat resourse here by the way:\nhttp://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/xenial/man8/mount.8.html\nThings that speed up your torrent cache drive:\n- Use a non-journaling FileSystem (Ext2)\n- noatime, nodiratime, relatime, nosuid, noexec. \n- Use a short mount point, or directory (the less ups and downs through a hierarchy of directories your software has to make, the better)\nOn that mount manpage, there are a LOT more options to go through.  If you use the ones I have selected (by only going through the new partition menus on a ubuntu install) then your torrent client will need to survive not knowing the dates of each chunk, it will need to be content writing this data at the end (which the FS usually does all the little dates anyways, so we are good there), you will not be able to run any downloaded software from that directory, (move it to another partition), The contents of the partition would essentially have a 666 access code, everyone can see, read, write, delete, copy each file and directory within this partition.  Though you may may be able to set the permission of the mount point (/tor) to ONLY allow your client and yourself.  Because with no UIDs or GIDs, the filesystem will not care who accesses the things. (Very bad for your privacy, risk of spyware, the NSA, and all those copyright infringement enforcers all seeing EXACTLY what you have on your drive.  But again, may be possible to block all other access from the mount point.  Any other items you have on a split drive, will be at a greater risk of failing along with that cache drive when (not if) it goes.  Your torrent client will (if settings enabled) re-check each download as it is marked complete, for its completion, and find any problems in the files, correct them (or throw error and you will need to manually tell the client to re-check the download), usually before moving it (according to completion moving rules).  You will want to keep as many torrents seeding afterwards as you can, rather than relocating them right away.\n", "Q: Using External Monitor with Laptop Monitor as separate monitors I am trying to use 32\"LCD monitor with my ubuntu 10.10 installation. I am trying to use my laptop screen and external monitor at the same time but having two separate desktops. I also want to use my laptop with 1280x800 resolution and external one with 1920 x 1080 using VGA. \nHowever, ubuntu sees my external LCD as a CRT and provide 13....x... resolution at the best not above. \nMy graphics card driver is Nvidia 270.... driver. \nIs ubuntu capable of using two monitors separately or should i give up?\nThank you \n\nA: I would recommend to install a tool called disper. It's a command line tool focused on NVIDIA-drivers, because they don't support xrandr.\nInfo: Disper homepage\nInstallation: PPA for Disper on launchpad\nYou can also look at my answer to a similar question. There are some example scripts i use with disper:\nSwitching Monitors\n\nA: Ubuntu does support multiple monitor configurations.  You should be able to configure how things are displayed from the Monitors control panel (under System -> Preferences).\nIf you are using the proprietary Nvidia driver, you might need to use the Nvidia specific settings tool instead.\n", "Q: How can I remove the top panel in Unity? I want to keep the Unity launcher only and remove the panel. Is there a way to do that?\n\nA: Not a complete answer, but you'll need to disable Global Menu first :\nsudo -s\necho \"export UBUNTU_MENUPROXY=\" > /etc/X11/Xsession.d/81ubuntumenuproxy\n\nThen restart your computer.  If you want the Global Menus restored, simply remove that file (sudo rm /etc/X11/Xsession.d/81ubuntumenuproxy).\nAfter that, if you can delete the top panel somehow, at least you'll keep most of your functionality.  You'll need some kind of replacement for some of the indicators, like network-manager and the session menu.\n\nA: Install cairo Dock and During login Change the environment to \"cd\" by clicking on the Ubuntu symbol at top of use name entry during login...By this you'll eliminate top panel but will miss the dash and unity scopes.\n\nA: By panel, you mean the global menu on the top of the screen?\nIf that's the case, I don't think it's possible because it's used for application's menu. If you would get rid of it, your apps wouldn't have menus.\n\nA: Use gnome to run the unity launcher (with it you can completely remove panels, since unity uses nautilus anyway it is essentially the same), and then run unity-2d-shell to get back just the unity launcher, you can then add it to start-up programs, by running gnome-session-properties \nWith this you can even run the unity launcher in xubuntu!

The business arrangement is between these plus business partners.\nI have tried setting up this arrangement but my efforts are not successful. Is thus possible? If so, how do I instruct the Ubuntu One Manager which folder should be synchronised in which account?\n\nA: There isn't any support in the client for managing multiple accounts in the Ubuntu One client software.\nThat said, you should be able to achieve the above using a single account:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create one account for you, and have your business partners do the same.\n\n*Put the files you want to share with business partners into a folder synchronised by Ubuntu One (either under ~/Ubuntu One, or another folder you've asked to synchronise).\n\n*Right click on this folder, and select Share... under the Ubuntu One submenu and enter the email addresses of the people you want to share the folder with.

For example, if you use the default Great Britain keyboard layout, you (are forced to) get the AltGr functionality.\nThe proper solution is to change the variant of the keyboard layout. Thus, if you do use the Great Britain layout, change to some other variant for Great Britain.\nLooking into /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/gb I see that there are no alternative for layouts that do not use the AltGr key.\nSo, for this example you would need to \ngksudo gedit /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/gb\n\nand then make this change (erase a line):\n@@ -26,7 +26,6 @@\n     key <BKSL> { [numbersign, asciitilde,   dead_grave,   dead_breve ] };\n     key <LSGT> { [ backslash,        bar,          bar,    brokenbar ] };\n\n-    include \"level3(ralt_switch_multikey)\"\n };\n\n partial alphanumeric_keys \n\n(find this segment in the file, then remove the line that starts with the -.\nThen, logout and log in again.

Sadly, there is no (current) way to workaround this problem: your friend's username was originally created with an empty display name in SSO (see bug #709496 in launchpad for details), and Ubuntu One stores user data for shares only at user creation time. So, even if your friend set up his display name in his profile, our database to build shares will no get updated. This last part needs to stay this way as long as we support Ubuntu One clients from Lucid, which do not support that the name of the sharing user changes once the share is created.\nBug #709496 is now fixed in the SSO servers, so the SSO desktop client app in Ubuntu 11.04 is already requesting to the newly created user to set a non-empty display name. For Maverick systems, we're trying to have this SRU accepted and released soon: bug #742678.\nI'm sorry I can't give you a workaround for this.

Have fun!\n\nA: Since Ubuntu is a beginner freindly Linux Distribution, there is plethora of resources available for answering your question, First I suggest you read the Ubuntu User Guide here\nYou can look through the Index of the book and find answers for the specific questions you have. But I recommend for you to read the book cover to cover if you can.\nOR\nYou can Google each of your questions and it will show you how often a variation of your question or the exact same question been answered before. \nHope this helps.\n\nA: My main suggestion sounds silly but it worked/still works for me: Break things! Seriously, try things out and if your set-up gets broken be prepared to start over. You'll learn a lot in this fashion.\nAlso:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open up a terminal and read the man pages of various commands e.g. type man mount and thoroughly read it. man pages are full of good information.\n\n*Take a look at tuxfiles. In particular, read through the tutorials on things like /etc/fstab and APT.\n\n*Try and grasp what each part of a command is meant to do before you issue it. If you don't know, then read the man page.\n\n*Search around on ubuntuforums and on here and also unix.stackexchange.\n\n*Install lots of software and play around.\n\n\nMost of all, have fun!\n\nA: I am a bit old school so I stick with books.

I read it once to get an idea and run some examples and now I just use it as a reference since its organized in chapters according to the tasks you want to do.\nDon't worry about the ubuntu version terminal in the back end is the same.\nIn cases that internet not available to your server environment (been there), a book is always the solution.\n\nA: In addition to the good suggestions already here about resources specific to Ubuntu, I recommend The Linux Documentation Project, which has a lot of good resources. In particular, to start, try Introduction to Linux - A Hands on Guide.\n", "Q: Moving files to /dev/shm ramdisk doesn't increase RAM usage? I've been wanting to make us of a ramdisk on my Ubuntu system for a while, and have done a bit of reading online. Most of the advice centres around using /dev/shm to move files into RAM.\nI wanted to try this out so I copied six 1GB files to /dev/shm, but according to gnome-system-monitor my RAM usage did not budge above 1.4GB. Is this how /dev/shm operates, or is there something else I need to do/use to ensure that files are stored in RAM and not on the HDD.\nThe reason I'm after the ramdisk is to speed up the analyses I run on this machine. Currently it uses at most about 1.6GB of the 24GB installed in the machine, and all that extra RAM doing nothing seems a bit of a shame.\n\nA: Don't use /dev/shm, that's for a special purpose.\nInstead, do something like this if you want to experiment:\nsudo mkdir /ram\nsudo mount -t tmpfs none /ram\n\nFiles stored in tmpfs are stored in either ram or (if there's too much memory pressure) in swap.  \nI don't know why you don't see an increase.  Please post the actual commands you used, plus the output of the free -m shell command before and after.\nYou might like to read this post about understanding free memory in Linux too.\nThe memory will be used to cache the files from disk, so it is actually in a sense helping, assuming your load has a multi-GB working set of files.  However, even heavily cached files do do some hard IO, and a ramdisk can be faster.\n", "Q: Not detecting any wireless I just installed 10.10 on Dell, http://www.ubuntu.com/certification/hardware/201011-6891 along with Widows 7.\nHowever it does not detect any wireless, so I am not able to connect to internet.\nWireless works on windows 7.\nI have added my wireless connection but it does not work either. \nIf I connect a cable, it works through Auto eth0.\nWhat is wrong and how can I fix the problem?\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: Go to System > Administration > Additional Drivers and see if you have a disabled proprietary driver. If any error occurs during enabling of proprietary driver go to Synaptic Package Manager and search for broadcom or bcm. There are lots of alternative. In my case bcmwl-kernel-source package worked. I also recommend you to see as well as paste which wireless card you have with lspci | grep wireless. Be sure to stay wired during this.\n\nA: You could try installing WICD as an alternative to network manager. Many people find network manager simply does not work. I have never had wifi working with network manager but WICD has always solved the issue for me. WICD has limitations in that it does not handle public wifi or VPN but for home and work wifi it is very good.\nPlug in your cable and install WICD from the software centre.\nThe type the following in the terminal\nsudo apt-get remove network-manager\nsudo /etc/init.d/wicd restart  \nIf this does not solve your problem I am out of my depth. \n", "Q: How to fetch the code of the binary installed on a  machine?

However, I can't remember how off the top of my head. I recommend reading the docs. :)\n\nA: First use dpkg -S to find what package the binary belongs to e.g:\ndpkg -S /bin/ls\n\nthis will output a line like\n\ncoreutils: /bin/ls\n\nThis means that coreutils is the package that /bin/ls belongs to.

This seems quite long winded as a solution.\nIs there a line of code to automatically find any and all missing keys? Or am I doomed to dig through these manually to become happy-ever-after?\n\nA: Launchpad-Getkeys (a small script packed in a .deb for easy installation) automatically imports all missing GPG keys. \nTo install and use it, open a terminal and copy/paste the following commands:\ncd ~/Downloads\nwget https://launchpad.net/~nilarimogard/+archive/webupd8/+files/launchpad-getkeys_0.3.1-1%7Ewebupd8%7Emaverick3_all.deb\nsudo dpkg -i launchpad-getkeys*.deb\nsudo launchpad-getkeys\n\nThe first command above changes the directory to your Downloads folder, the second downloads the .deb, third command installs the .deb and the last command runs \"launchpad-getkeys\" script which automatically imports all missing GPG keys.\nIf you're using a proxy, there are some things you need to change though so let me know if you need info on that too.\nBy the way, I see you have some other errors too, not just GPG keys.

If you upgrade from Maverick, it'll continue to work as before.\nWhether it's safe or not, Natty still isn't a production-ready operating system.

Looking for a series of commands that will show me the largest files on a drive.\n\nA: This seems like the perfect application for find:\nfind $DIRECTORY -type f -exec ls -s {} \\; | sort -n | tail -n 5\n\nThis command will find all files in directory $DIRECTORY and execute ls -s on them. The last command prints the allocated size of a file plus the filename. The result is sorted numerically and and the last five entries are shown. So as result you'll see the largest 5 files in $DIRETORY or any subdirectory. If you enter tail -n 1 you'll see only the largest file.\nFurthermore you can play around a lot with find. For instance you can look for files which are younger than n days (-ctime -n) or which belong to special users (-user johndoe).\n\nA: A great, user-friendly tool referenced in the answer to a similar question is NCurses Disk Usage tool:\nsudo ncdu /\n\n\nA: My favorite solution uses a mix from several of these good answers.\ndu -aBM 2>/dev/null | sort -nr | head -n 50 | more\n\ndu arguments:\n\n\n*\n\n*-a for \"all\" files and directories.

The next command will list all files larger than 10MiB (not to be confused with 10MB):\nfind / -size +10M -ls\n\nIf you want to find files between a certain size, you can combine it with a \"size lower than\" search. The next command find files between 10MiB and 12MiB:\nfind / -size +10M -size -12M -ls\n\n\napt-cache search 'disk usage' lists some programs available for disk usage analysis. One application that looks very promising is gt5.\nFrom the package description:\n\nYears have passed and disks have become larger and larger, but even on this incredibly huge harddisk era, the space seems to disappear over time. This small and effective programs provides more convenient listing than the default du(1). It displays what has happened since last run and displays dir size and the total percentage. It is possible to navigate and ascend to directories by using cursor-keys with text based browser (links, elinks, lynx etc.)\n\n\nOn the \"related packages\" section of gt5, I found ncdu. From its package description:\n\nNcdu is a ncurses-based du viewer. It provides a fast and easy-to-use interface through famous du utility. It allows to browse through the directories and show percentages of disk usage with ncurses library.\n\n\n\nA: I just use a combination of du and sort. \nsudo du -sx /* 2>/dev/null | sort -n\n\n0   /cdrom\n0   /initrd.img\n0   /lib64\n0   /proc\n0   /sys\n0   /vmlinuz\n4   /lost+found\n4   /mnt\n4   /nonexistent\n4   /selinux\n8   /export\n36  /media\n56  /scratchbox\n200 /srv\n804 /dev\n4884    /root\n8052    /bin\n8600    /tmp\n9136    /sbin\n11888   /lib32\n23100   /etc\n66480   /boot\n501072  /web\n514516  /lib\n984492  /opt\n3503984 /var\n7956192 /usr\n74235656    /home\n\nThen it's a case of rinse and repeat. Target the subdirectories you think are too big, run the command for them and you find out what's causing the problem.\nNote: I use du's -x flag to keep things limited to one filesystem (I have quite a complicated arrangement of cross-mounted things between SSD and RAID5).\nNote 2: 2>/dev/null redirects any error messages into oblivion. If they don't bother you, it's not obligatory.\n\nA: Try Baobab, it gives you a graphical overview of files and folders, you can see where the real space hogs are and delete them with one click\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Baobab\n\nA: To display the biggest top-20 directories (recursively) in the current folder, use the following one-liner:\ndu -ah . | sort -rh | head -20\n\nor (more Unix oriented):\ndu -a . | sort -rn | head -20\n\nFor the top-20 biggest files in the current directory (recursively):\nls -1Rs | sed -e \"s/^ *//\" | grep \"^[0-9]\" | sort -nr | head -n20\n\nor with human readable sizes:\nls -1Rhs | sed -e \"s/^ *//\" | grep \"^[0-9]\" | sort -hr | head -n20\n\n\nPlease note that -h is available for GNU sort only, so to make it work on OSX/BSD properly, you've to install it from coreutils. Then add its folder into your PATH.\n\nSo these aliases are useful to have in your rc files (every time when you need it):\nalias big='du -ah . | sort -rh | head -20'\nalias big-files='ls -1Rhs | sed -e \"s/^ *//\" | grep \"^[0-9]\" | sort -hr | head -n20'\n\n\nA: qbi's answer is correct but it will be very slow when there are a lot of files since it will start a new ls process for each item.\na much faster version using find without spawning child processes would be to use printf to print the size in bytes (%s) and the path (%p) \nfind \"$directory\" -type f -printf \"%s - %p\\n\" | sort -n | tail -n $num_entries\n\nA: To find all GB files for instance I would use du and grep, though the other methods mentioned here seem great as well. \ndu -h -a /dir | grep \"[0-9]G\\b\"  \n\nYou can also get fancy with the --except option that du has. \n\nA: You could also sort files by size:\nfind . -type f -exec du -h {} \\; | sort -k1 -h\n\nIt finds only files and executes du -h for every file, which shows the size of the file. Lastly, we sort the output of find/du according to the first column (in human readable format).\nThe last printed file is the largest one.\n\nA: You can use the command to see the largest files while skipping the directories:\nsudo find / -type f -printf “%s\\t%p\\n” | sort -n | tail -1\nfind $HOME -type f -printf ‘%s %p\\n’ | sort -nr | head -10\n\nTo find all files that are larger than 100MiB (this is not 100MB, see here if you are confused):\nfind / -size +100M -ls\n\nthe command below will  display the largest 5 files in the folder $DIRECTORY:\nfind $DIRECTORY -type f -exec ls -s {} \\; | sort -n | tail -n 5\n\nUSING du :\nThe command below which uses du, display the directories with the 20 largest sizes in the home working folder:\nsudo du -a /home | sort -n -r | head -n 20\n\nNow in order now to display the largest directories/files including sub-folders, run:\ndu -Sh | sort -rh | head -n 10\n\nUsing ls:\nTo list the 5 top largest files in the /bin directory , issue the command below:\nls -lSh /bin | head -5\n\nYou can also use the Disk Usage Analyzer or Baobao as shown here for example.\n\nA: I think my answer here is useful: https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/728364/why-doesnt-df-show-the-filesystem-disk-space-of-the-path-that-i-give-it/728373#728373\nbut the short summary is TLDR:\nFor space usage do:\ndf -h path2inode\nabove for systemfile usage\n\ndu -hs path2inode\ndu -hs ~ | grep data | head -5\ndu -hs ~ | sort rh | head -5\nabove for specific inode.

I removed this installation with mkfs and now this partition is clean. I burned a start-up Ubuntu disc and I am trying to install it.\nFor some strange reasons ubuntu installer mounts this drive as /cdrom and I can't go on with the instalation because 'It cannot be unmounted\" and \"partition table cannot be altered\"\nI don't want to repartition the HDD neither to format anything. The only changes I introduced to the partition table within the installer was to set up mounting points.\nSo how to install Ubuntu in this case? I've tried a lot of different things,\ne.g. it doesn't help to move the HDD to another controller. So even if /dev/sda is a clean new HDD and /dev/sdb is the HDD of interest, the stupid installer still mounts it (now /dev/sdb) \nSo I did another experiment: I put a third HDD into the machine. Now it looks as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*/dev/sda1 - 1TB (irrelevant HDD with ext3 partition)\n\n*/dev/sdb1 - 1TB with another Ubuntu 10.10 32 bit installation\n\n*/dev/sdc1 - 1TB THE HARD DRIVE, where Ubuntu 10.10 32 bit used to be installed\n\n\nUnfortunately even now the installer says \"your installation medium is /dev/sdc1\" WHY? Why there but neither on /dev/sda1 nor on /dev/sdb2???\nAlthough now I have 3 HDDs, I can't play too much with them, because:\n\n\n*\n\n*/dev/sdb1 holds my backup of /dev/sda1\n\n*/dev/sdc1 is borrowed from another machine and I don't want to have yet another problem with ubuntu installation (when I would mess up /dev/sdc1)\n\n\nI also need to keep partition table on the target drive because there are other partitions there with users' data\n\nA: OK, I still don't know what is the reason for the strange behavior of Ubuntu installer, but I solved the problem by installing Gentoo on the partition.\nAfter that the installation of ubuntu (on gentoo partition) went as it should (exactly as it is described in a manual) \n", "Q: Can I resize the Unity panel? \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow can I configure Unity? \n\nIn 11.04, how do I resize the panel?

Since I discovered htop, I no longer use top.\n\nA: Run top in a terminal and see what program is hogging the cpu and kill it.  The most likely suspect is flash.\n\nA: I think that your processor has to many processes to run, especially flash and VLC, \nwhich, depending on your videos quality, may use much of your processor. \nI had the same problem, and I could suggest you to run applications separately, not all at \nthe same time, so your processor can carry fewer tasks but with better performance.\nIf you want to see the exactly amount of CPU each app uses, go to System->Administration->System Monitor->Processes. \nHope this is helpful.\n", "Q: How do I remove a repository from the terminal?

Instead, this worked (via the terminal or run prompt):\nunity --reset\n\n\nA: I know it's a very old question but it ranks high on Google and newcomers can benefit from this update. As GConf is deprecated, dconf should be used instead. To reset compiz to default settings you can run the following command:\ndconf reset -f /org/compiz/\n\nThis should work on 14.04 and up.\n\nA: The reset in the ccsm breaks the system\nFor that you need to\n\n\n*\n\n*Open terminal Ctrl+Alt+T\n\n*Then type sudo apt-get install unity\n\n*And then reset the unity unity --reset\n", "Q: How can I get compose back on ibus?

In Natty, ubuntu one gives a notification every time it syncs, and I have my empathy logs synced, so now every time I write or recive an IM I get a notification that the logs have been synced.

For some reason I'm getting an error during apport upgrades, the cause of which is \n% sudo service apport start\nstart: Job failed to start\n\nUnder sysvinit, I could debug this kind of problem by running eg\nsudo sh -x /etc/init.d/whatever start\n\nbut that doesn't seem to map over to Upstart.  What should I try next?\nIt turns out there is a workaround that will let the install proceed.  But I'm still interested in the general question of how one would trace the script.\n\nA: All of the following information (and quite a lot more useful Upstart help) is from The Upstart Cookbook.   Section 18 covers debugging.\nhttp://upstart.ubuntu.com/cookbook/#debugging\nIn this specific case of tracing a \"script\" stanza of an Upstart job you should add the following lines right below the word \"script\":\nexec 2>>/dev/.initramfs/myjob.log\nset -x\n\nThe reason for the odd location is that /dev/.initramfs/ is available in very early boot, before the root file system has been loaded, and continues to be available after boot.  I'm guessing with apport, however, you probably don't need to use that path.  Still, it's nice to know the option.\nIt should also be noted that all scripts are run with set -e so any command that fails will exit the script entirely.  Which makes sense, as one should be very careful when running scripts as root.\nI highly recommend consulting the Upstart Cookbook linked above in general for anyone working with Upstart jobs.  \n\nA: Upstart logs your service execution in a log file by the same name in /var/log/upstart/your-service-name.log. It should be helpful.\n", "Q: How does unity draw the fallback panel window buttons? Can the images used be changed manually regardless of gtkrc present? For example, by replacing the images in a folder?\n\nA: It is possible to change the colour of the minimise and unmaximise buttons as they both follow the panel text gtk colour. The close button always remains orange/red.\nIt is also possible to get the panel to draw ANY buttons you want but to do this the Metacity theme and gtkrc being used must be called Ambiance and follow it's button naming schema.\nAny metacity theme in the home/(username)/.themes may be used as long as the gtkrc being used is still called Ambiance. This means the panel will draw the buttons from the folder usr/share/themes/Ambiance/metacity-1 as long as whatever theme being used is called Ambiance (does not matter if the gtkrc resides in all users or personal theme folder)\nThe downsides to all of this are that:\na) Only one theme may be set up to properly draw the panel buttons at a time.\nb) It must be called Ambiance which can be confusing and means that any decision to try a new theme that draws the panel buttons requires overwriting the Ambiance metacity in usr/share/themes.\nIt would be a lot better if Unity had the ability to probe any theme under usr/share/themes for an appropriate Metacity and only go back to the fall back buttons if it didn't find one.\n", "Q: Is there an applet or tool that can show an overview of workspaces?

Many of the Drupal distributions I've seen are made for earlier versions of Ubuntu: drubuntu only works in 10.10; the Acquia .debs are for <10.x, and I've been told the versions in the repos are out-of-date. What's the easiest way to set up a local testing server for Drupal? \n\nA: *\n\n*Install LAMP just run sudo tasksel and follow the installation  How to install LAMP \n\n*Download Drupal and extract inside /var/www/ \n\n*locate the durupal directory using browser http://localhost/drupal \n\n*it is easy to install drupal ones you have setup LAMP use the drupal installation instruction to install Drupal\n\nA: Drupal is a free and open-source content-management system, and it’s surprisingly flexible. You can use it for everything from a small blog to a major business or government site.  It's a mildly tricky setup, since you basically have to build a LAMP server from scratch, but here’s a step-by-step guide on how to do it.\nFirst, install Ubuntu into your machine of choice. Once Ubuntu is installed and updated, you will need to install and configure four pieces of software to create a LAMP server to support Drupal: the Apache web server, the MySQL database server, PHP , and the MySQL module for PHP.\nBegin with the Apache web server. To install Apache, open up a Terminal window (Applications, Accessories, Terminal), and type the following command (note that all Terminal commands are case-sensitive):\nsudo apt-get install apache2\n\nFollow the prompts to install Apache. Once the installation is finished, you can test that Apache is working by opening up Firefox and navigating to http://localhost. If you see the “it works!” web page, you have Apache up and running.\nNext, you’ll need to install MySQL. Return to the Terminal and type this command:\nsudo apt-get install mysql-server-5.6\n\nDuring the installation you be will asked to provide a root password for MySQL. Be sure to pick a strong password (a combination of lowercase, punctuation, and uppercase letters), since the root user has full access to all tables on all databases. For obvious reasons, you’ll want to remember this password, not least because we need it again in the following steps. MySQL is a big package, and depending on your connection and computer speed, it might take a while to install.\nNext, install PHP version 5:\nsudo apt-get install php5\n\nThen install the MySQL module for PHP:\nsudo apt-get install php5-mysql\n\nInstall gd module for PHP:\nsudo apt-get install php5-gd\n\nFinally, download the Drupal software to your Downloads folder. You can obtain it from here on the drupal.org site.\nNow that we’ve got our software installed and downloaded, we’ll need to configure it.\nFirst, you’ll probably need to add a line to your /etc/apache2/apache2.conf file.  I’ve read differing things about this, but I have found in my own testing that Drupal would not function properly without it, since Apache did not properly interpret the PHP pages otherwise. To edit apache2.conf, use the following command:\nsudo -H gedit /etc/apache2/apache2.conf\n\n(Note that it’s a good idea to back up any system configuration file before editing it. You can do so quickly by using sudo cp /etc/apache2/apache2.conf ~/Desktop to save a copy to your Desktop. You can of course use vi or emacs or the editor of your choice, but most new users seem to prefer gedit)\nOnce you are in gedit, add the following line to the end of the file:\nAddType application/x-httpd-php.html\n\nSave the file and exit gedit. Restart Apache with this command, so it re-reads its configuration file:\nsudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart\n\nNow we’ll need to prepare MySQL for use with Drupal. First, you’ll need to run MySQL’s install script:\nsudo mysql_install_db\n\nAnd then this command, to properly secure MySQL. Follow the default prompts to remove the testing database in MySQL:\nsudo mysql_secure_installation\n\nOnce this is completed, log into the MySQL command-line client:\nmysql -u root –p\n\nEnter your MySQL root user password from above, and you’ll find yourself at the MySQL> local client prompt. First, create a database for Drupal to use:\nCREATE DATABASE drupal;\n\n(Note that all commands entered in the MySQL local client must end with a semicolon to denote the end of the statement.)\nOnce the database is created, you’ll need to create a database user for Drupal to use. While still in the MySQL command line client, type this:\nCREATE USER drupaluser;\n\nThen create a password for your new user (note that your password will actually go within the quotation marks, and is case-sensitive):\nSET PASSWORD FOR drupaluser = PASSWORD(“password”);\n\nNow that you’ve got your Drupal database and your Drupal database user, you’ll need to grant the user all permissions on the database (again, the password goes within the quotation marks, and is case sensitive):\nGRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON drupal.* TO drupaluser@localhost IDENTIFIED BY ‘password’;\n\n(Make sure to append “@localhost” to drupaluser; otherwise you’ll get a database error when you try to start Drupal for the first time.)\nGo ahead and exit MySQL:\n\\q\n\nNext, make a directory for Drupal with this command:\nsudo mkdir /var/www/drupal\n\nNext, you’ll need to unpack the Drupal files and move them to the /var/www/drupal directory. Once the files have been unpacked and copied, you’ll need to make a few changes. First, you’ll have to create a settings.php file for Drupal to use during the installation:\nsudo cp /var/www/drupal/sites/default/default.settings.php /var/www/drupal/sites/default/settings.php\n\nNext, make the file writable:\nsudo chmod 666 /var/www/drupal/sites/default/settings.php\n\nThen create a files directory for Drupal to use:\nsudo mkdir /var/www/drupal/sites/default/files\n\nMark the files directory as writable:\nsudo chmod 775 /var/www/drupal/sites/default/files\n\nNow you’re ready to install Drupal. Open up a web browser on your Ubuntu system and navigate to http://localhost/drupal. You’ll be redirected to the Drupal installation page. Click on the \"Install Drupal In English\" link to continue.\nif http://localhost/drupal directs you to the 404 page, Apache is likely looking for the wrong document root.  Run the following:\nsudo -H gedit /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default.conf\n\nReplace DocumentRoot /var/www/html/ with DocumentRoot /var/www/; save and exit.\nRestart apache to register the changes:\nsudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart\n\nGo back to the web browser and navigate to http://localhost/drupal.  Click on the \"Install Drupal In English\" link to continue.\nOn the next page, you’ll be asked for the database name, username, and password you created earlier. Enter those names and continue. On the next page, you’ll be asked to set an admin username and password and a few other settings.\nAfter that, your basic Drupal installation is finished, and you can choose how to further customize the site. One last thing you should do; use this command to change the settings.php file so it is no longer world writeable:\nsudo chmod 644 /var/www/drupal/sites/default/settings.php\n\n\nA: There is a far more easier way. Use Drubuntu from Drubuntu.info. This sets up Drupal for you right from the start and you could create your Ubuntu Environemnt arround it. Install your favorite desktop and so on \n", "Q: (Dual monitors) Indicators displaying in panel on both monitors The time, power, notification, networking and weather applets are displaying in the panel on both of my monitors in Natty.

I get a failure for the symlink version and a success for the hard link version.\nSecond, passing numeric constants as the flags argument for open is unportable and makes your code difficult to read.  The relevant flags are defined in <fcntl.h>, and the constant you are using is O_WRONLY.\nIf you pass a symlink as the first argument to open, it is equivalent to passing the name the symlink points to.  In your example, the symlink points to a non-existent file, causing the system call to fail.  If you would like the call to create the file, you will need to pass O_WRONLY|O_CREAT as flags.  This will result in the file foo being created.\nFor the hard link case, the name bar links to foo's file contents rather than the name.  Unlinking foo doesn't change this fact, so bar continues to exist and can be opened without O_CREAT.\n\nA: I'll make a quick reference from an existing article,\nWith hardlink files,  \n\nWhen deleting files, the data part isn't disposed of until all the filename parts have been deleted. There's a count in the inode that indicates how many filenames point to this file, and that count is decremented by 1 each time one of those filenames is deleted. When the count makes it to zero, the inode and its associated data are deleted. \n\nPlease read The difference between hard and soft links for details.\nLike, you may be interested in this other factoid on hardlinks,  \n\nthe count also reflects how many times the file has been opened without being closed (in other words, how many references to the file are still active). This has some ramifications which aren't obvious at first: you can delete a file so that no \"filename\" part points to the inode, without releasing the space for the data part of the file, because the file is still open. \n\nYou could try that with your test-code.\nbtw: can you recheck your two cases?\nI think you would get error for the symlink() case and success for the link() case.\nI suggest you run them in different directories or use different file names for the two cases :-) \n", "Q: \"you do not have the hardware required to run Unity\" on VMware On Ubuntu 2010.10 I installed VMware.

I am using Ubuntu 10.10 with two or three keyboard layouts (US, RU, DE).

It changes one byte of a name, so that the shortcut reference becomes invalid...\nThis frees-up the Ctrl+D shortcut, and allows the plugin to function normally, and the new Ctrl+D menu-item is editable.   \nThe only side-effect appears to be that a \"Warning\" is issued, which you can see if you start 'gedit' from the terminal...\nBecause this is a \"hack\" (in the roughest sense of the word), it is possible that there could be other side-effects, eg. maybe something doesn't get cleaned up properly... but I'll be using it...  \nHere is the 2-minute hack:\n(The fix will need to be re-applied when gedit is updated)     \n# Make a backup of 'gedit' binary\nsudo cp /usr/bin/gedit{,.before-ctrl+d-hack} \n\n# Hexedit the 'gedit' binary ...(I've used 'ghex2`)\ngksu ghex2 /usr/bin/gedit\n\n# In 'ghex2' \n#     Find the string: delete_from_cursor\n#     Replace it with: #elete_from_cursor\n#\n# Save the binary, and exit... \n#\n\n", "Q: Is there a way to change what time the update manager checks for updates? I see where to set the frequency ie weekly, daily, etc, but not how to set what time of day it checks.\n\nA: Apt updates are triggered by a script called /etc/cron.daily/apt. /etc/cron.daily contains several scripts that happen every day, but all at the same time. In order to change the time when Update Manager updates, you need to change the time when all the /etc/cron.daily scripts fire off.\nTo do that you need to edit your /etc/crontab file:\nsudoedit /etc/crontab # or: gksu gedit /etc/crontab\n\nThis is a fairly standard cron file that should look a little something like this:\n# /etc/crontab: system-wide crontab\n# Unlike any other crontab you don't have to run the `crontab'\n# command to install the new version when you edit this file\n# and files in /etc/cron.d. These files also have username fields,\n# that none of the other crontabs do.\n\nSHELL=/bin/sh\nPATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin\n\n# m h dom mon dow user  command\n17 *    * * *   root    cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.hourly\n25 6    * * *   root    test -x /usr/sbin/anacron || ( cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.daily )\n47 6    * * 7   root    test -x /usr/sbin/anacron || ( cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.weekly )\n52 6    1 * *   root    test -x /usr/sbin/anacron || ( cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.monthly )\n#\n\nFrom this we can see cron.daily triggers at 6:25am. If you wanted to start it at 4am, you'd replace the second times line with:\n0 4    * * *   root    test -x /usr/sbin/anacron || ( cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.daily )\n\nIf you need more help with the format, Wikipedia has an unusually technical page on Cron.\n\nA: Thanks people.

Is it possible to convert btrfs to ext4 without losing data? I'm experiencing a very low speed on read/write operations on btrfs.\n\nA: I'm just going on the available tools, not experience or documentation. You might want to test this with a partition (even just an image) you don't mind losing if it all goes wrong. Don't attempt this without taking a backup.\nbtrfs-convert has a roll-back function to undo a conversion. I'm not sure if this works for partitions that weren't converted to btrfs with btrfs-convert.\n\n\n*\n\n*Start by unmounting the filesystem. If it's essential to the system, boot into a LiveCD.\n\n*Install btrfs-tools\nsudo apt-get install btrfs-tools\n\n\n*Roll back the conversion\nsudo btrfs-convert -r /dev/sdXn\n\n\nA: As far as I know you cannot convert btrfs to any other filesystem.\n\nA: I did this using a system with multiboot distros (Ubuntu on ext4, Xubuntu on btrfs). Running Ubuntu, I have taken the Xubuntu btrfs home partition, and archived it using fsarchiver. I was then able to restore it, again using fsarchiver, to a different partition and specify ext4 filesystem type. That seemed to work okay. \nStill in Ubuntu, I mounted the Xubuntu root partition on /mnt, and edited /mnt/@/etc/fstab to change the mount for /home to point to the new ext4 partition, changing both the UUID and the fs type, and deleting the subvolume data. I saved the file, and rebooted into Xubuntu. \nThere was an error in booting, and booting halted. The error was that I had another partition I wanted to mount to my ~/Documents directory which failed. I selected to manually fix the problem. It turns out that my root partition mounted okay as ext4, but when I did a list command I got\n#ls /home\n@home\n\nSo the original btrfs subvolume structure was still there in the ext4 filesystem. I issued the command\nmount --bind /home/@home /home\n\nI then pressed ctrl-D to continue booting, and Xubuntu continued booting and everything came up fine. I haven't done it yet, as I'm still on this initial boot, but I'm certain I could put that bind command in my fstab file. Or perhaps I could have left the subvolume info in the fstab entry, I don't know.\nWhat I will do instead, however (this is off-topic), is take a more mature instance of a /home (ext4) partition for Xubuntu from another computer and use that instead. I've already proven that this will work.\n\nA: **The solution that works in all cases, is of course to copy everything from the root partition to a directory on another partition (assuming you have one with enough free space), reformat / as ext4, copy back. I just did that, and hit a few issues so I thought I'd write a little howto:\n\n*\n\n*Boot on a rescue USB key, mount both partitions (let's say /mnt for the real root partition, and /dest for the partition serving as a temporary destination)\n\n*Beware that you should mount the BTRFS subvolumes too (I didn't do that, and I lost all of /var, /opt, /root...). The best way is probably to do the usual chroot dance (mount --bind /dev /mnt/dev; mount --bind /sys /mnt/sys; mount --bind /proc /mnt/proc; chroot /mnt) and then mount -a -t btrfs so that the subvolumes described in /etc/fstab are all mounted.\n\n*Exit the chroot or use another TTY (Ctrl+Alt+F2), and launch the copy, like cp -a /mnt /dest\n\n*Reformat the partition:\n\n*umount /mnt\n\n*mkfs.ext4 /dev/*the_root_device*\n\n*mount /dev/*the_root_device* /mnt\n\n*Copy back the data with cp -a /dest/mnt/* /mnt\nAnd now (in the chroot) don't forget to\n\n*edit /etc/fstab to remove all subvolumes, change the filesystem type from btrfs to ext4, and update the UUID (see the output of blkid, or switch to a label like LABEL=rootfs after doing tune2fs -L rootfs /dev/*the_root_device*)\n\n*mkinitrd or dracut, and recreate the bootloader (I use another distro so I don't have the exact command for this step on ubuntu).\nCross fingers and reboot.\nFinally, remember to clean up the /dest copy in the temporary destination.**\n\n", "Q: Why won't ssh-agent save my unencrypted key for later use? Every time I SSH into another server from our headless Ubuntu server I am asked for the password to my key file.

Alternatively, you can ln -s /path/to/ssh-ident ~/bin/ssh or some other directory in your PATH before /bin and /usr/bin.\n\nA: Even if agent is up, if certain environment variables are not set, you have no reference to agent. Furthermore, even if it is all ok, agent and variables, the identity are not automatically sent to agent: that is a task for ssh-askpass, working only in X sessions.\nIf you are using bash, create the file ~/.bash_profile with this content:\n# File: ~/.bash_profile\n\n# source ~/.profile, if available\nif [[ -r ~/.profile ]]; then\n  . ~/.profile\nfi\n\n# start agent and set environment variables, if needed\nagent_started=0\nif ! env | grep -q SSH_AGENT_PID >/dev/null; then\n  echo \"Starting ssh agent\"\n  eval $(ssh-agent -s)\n  agent_started=1\nfi\n\n# ssh become a function, adding identity to agent when needed\nssh() {\n  if ! ssh-add -l >/dev/null 2>&-; then\n    ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_dsa\n  fi\n  /usr/bin/ssh \"$@\"\n}\nexport -f ssh\n\n# another example: git\ngit() {\n  if ! ssh-add -l >/dev/null 2>&-; then\n    ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_dsa\n  fi\n  /usr/bin/git \"$@\"\n}\nexport -f git\n\nmodify the file name ~/.ssh/id_dsa following your needs, and add this line to ~/.bash_logout\n# stuff to add at end of ~/.bash_logout\nif ((agent_started)); then\n  echo \"Killing ssh agent\"\n  ssh-agent -k\nfi\n\nA last note: this do not interfere with a gnome session, because in that case only ~/.profile is sourced, and you can benefit from the ssh-askpass graphical interface that ask for a passphrase and send it to the ssh-agent.\n\nA: This question has a quite good answer over at SuperUser.\nI found the hint to use Keychain pretty useful.\n", "Q: Annoying clicking noise on Asus 1018p, how to turn it off?

Are the daily development builds of Ubuntu  (Known as Ubuntu+1) stable and mature enough for general desktop usage?\nAlso, if I install the latest daily build today, will it notify for the update of the stable release when Ubuntu+1 is officially announced?\n\nA: The problems with daily builds during this phase of the release cycle are typically installation failures for one reason or another, rather than problems once you actually start trying to use it on the desktop.  If it installs fine for you, you can continuously upgrade to the stable release and beyond.\n\nA: How useful the development daily images are depends very much on which part of the development cycle we're in.  During the alphas, there is a high degree of churn and daily breakage is frequent.  They are very useful for developers, but not recommended for general desktop users.   As we get to the beta phases of a release,  things are generally much more stable and usable for general desktop users to try things out.\n\nA: First, remember that a development build of Ubuntu is exactly that - a development build. So things will break.\nWith that being said, your mileage may vary. \nSecond, if you run update-manager (or sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade) fairly frequently (Read: Daily), on release day in theory you will be on the same Ubuntu as everyone else - although I don't recommend using a Ubuntu+1 install for daily usage, even after release day. \nIt's better to just start fresh, or to upgrade your previous Ubuntu stable installation, if you're into that kind of thing.\nLastly (and I can't stress this enough) if you're not a developer, you really shouldn't be running the development version.\n\nA: Firstly, whether a daily build is stable enough for daily usage mostly depends on your ability to troubleshoot problems. Secondly, the question was asked late April 2011, seven days before release day of Ubuntu 11.04. If you're seven days away from release day, if you have a working OS on your computer, I'd recommend waiting until release day. If you don't have a working OS on your computer, you're closer to release day than to the date the most recent alpha/beta was released, go for it.\nWhat I recommend is to check the release schedule. If the feature freezes haven't kicked in yet, you could end up with very unpredictable results.\nAnother thing you can do is run the daily build as a virtual machine (virtualbox, vmware, etc.), and set it up as you normally would (extra repositories, run updates, etc.). Once you've tested it as a virtual machine and are confident that you can install it to your computer without trouble, go for it. Be warned, you may end up with irreversible problems where the easiest solution is to do a fresh install.\nLastly, as always, back everything up before you consider reformatting your OS partition.\n\nA: i been using daily builds and beta on 14.04 and so far keeping my fingers crossed and knocking on my fake wood. So far the 14.04 is very stable i get some crashes as known for pre-releases but they been more stable than previous versions of ubuntu.\n", "Q: Setting Up Automated Offline Back-Up I am going to be running an Ubuntu Server.

It is built with tcpwrappers so you can restrict access with /etc/hosts.allow and /etc/hosts.deny. \n\n*You can use xrdp to start the VNC server and firewall access to the RDP port.

In Unity, if you open the applications dash or even if you just press the meta key to open the search dash, they always pop out with a default size of something looking 800x600ish. In the lower right hand of the dash is an icon which maximizes the overlay to the whole screen.\nIs there a way to get these dash overlays to pop out maximized by default?\n\nA: The dash is designed to open \"half-way\" for screens that are larger than a standard netbook.

The question asks for a single computer setup, while I thought it was a two computer sync video setup.\nI achieved exactly this using a 3x3 matrix of 9 computers using a mix of VLC & ssh. See What to do with a cluster of old computers running Ubuntu? for a pic.\nI first tried doing the exact same thing that the other users suggested, but soon found out that running videos on sync is indeed a very difficult thing. I tried using crontabs to start videos at exactly the same time (after synchronizing clocks), but even if the command is issued at the same time, the player load times vary across computers, rendering it useless.\nSo the final solution I came up with was to stream the video using RTSP in VLC over a networked computer (which acts like the admin). I setup password-less ssh from admin to the two clients. And then finally, sent the commands over ssh to play the video.\nVLC offers a special wall mode where you can break your video into a wall. Using that, you can specify any particular frame from the wall to be started in full-screen. So in my case, all 9 screens full-screened different portions.\nI'll try to post the exact commands as soon as I can get them for you.\nPS: A few recommendations :\n* VLC does not stream everything perfectly. I found that streaming mpg files was easiest. \n* Match the aspect ratio of the video with your monitors. (For instance if they're old CRTs (as in my case) with 4:3 ratio, then your video should probably be 8:3.\n", "Q: kruft: why do i gain 1GB each time i do a distribution upgrade \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow do I clean up my harddrive? \n\nEvery 5 months I start running out of space on my root partition...\n  I scramble to erase documentation, remove log files, and keep only a single kernel so as to keep enough space.\nAnd then every time I run a distribution upgrade (cdromupgrade) I end up with about a gig more space even though it keeps all the same programs installed.\nAnyone know where the kruft is?\n\nA: You may want to run sudo du -x --max-depth=1 / | sort -n to see where your space is going.  You can walk the directories to get a better idea where the space is going.  I generally find the space ends up being in few directories. \nYou may want to try running sudo apt-get clean to remove all the debs from the cache directory.  The directory /var/cache/apt/archives can grow quite large if you don't clean it out.  Once the packages are installed, you don't need the .deb archived.  They are helpful if you need to reinstall the package, or find the original version of a file that was installed. \n\nA: You can try running sudo apt-get autoremove and sudo apt-get autoclean which may free up some space.  Normally the update manager should do this for you but perhaps cdromupgrade doesn't.\n\nA: KDirStat is a fairly direct way of finding where all your space is going.\n", "Q: Why does my computer startup again when suspended? the whole point of suspending a computer is to make it cool off and be quiet.

Is there anything like this, either as a Nautilus extension or a standalone program?\n\nEdit\nI just upgraded to 11.04, and it looks like something is in the works with this... if I right-click a file, the context menu has a \"Tags...\" option which lets me tag files (this is also available in file properties via a \"Tags\" tab).  A handful of my files appear to be automatically tagged, even.   ...or did this happen when I installed Tracker?\nThe only problem is, I can't find any way to make use of the tags.  Is there a way to search them?  Using the Unity search bar doesn't appear to do the job (yet).\n\nA: Nautilus from gnome-team ppa has an extension for add/removing tags, and I've posted another python-extension for filter file/dirs by tags\nHow to search for files by tags?\nhttps://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=670163\nhttps://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=670643\n\nA: Try getting Activity Journal. It should have search functions since it integrates with zeitgeist (the tagging / history saving program). Activity Journal on Launchpad\nSupposedly the version currently in the software center does not work properly in 11.04 at this time, so use the .deb from the link provided here.\n\nA: It might be overkill, but at least you might get good ideas by trying an ECM (Enterprise Content Management) solution like the open source Alfresco.\nYou don't have to use all of Alfresco's features, but it has:\n\n\n*\n\n*Tagging\n\n*Categorizing (more rigid than tags, plus hierarchy)\n\n*Versioning\n\n\nIt has a Web UI, but you can use the files with Nautilus via WebDAV.\nWarning: The learning curve is pretty steep.\n\nA: If the other answers don't work for everyone, perhaps a great search tool can bridge the gap between manual organization and usability?\nRecoll on Linux completely rocks. It understands metadata for many file types - audio, video, images, office-docs, html, text, ... lots of types. If the metadata is accurate, it is great, but with the full text indexing, for documents that have clear titles, authors, dates and subject, it still works very well.\nI've deployed Alfresco and in a business, the results for Alfresco and Recoll are similar. For a home user, Recoll is so much lighter and easier to use, there is no comparison. Recoll can be used for a website search engine, if you are running the webserver too, though swish-e http://joshr.com/src/docs/IndexingWithSwishe-Rabinowitz.pdf and ht-dig are probably more efficient for that need.\nxattr - Extended attributes\nSomething else that could work is using a file system that supports xattrs.  These are user created tags connected to file objects like ACLs. I don't know of any easy methods to connect/attach xattrs to files besides using CLI tools. Another issue is that because xattrs aren't used too much, many backup programs ignore them completely. If you are lucky, there might be an option to add xattr support to your backup tool. If not, losing all that added metadata due to a disk failure would be expected. The amount of xattrs that ext2/3/4 file system objects can have is limited by the block size for the file system.  That could be 512b or 4096b, depending on the storage used.  XFS doesn't have any practical limits.\n\nA: You can try tagspaces. In comparison to other tools, it is not using database, but  saves the tags in the name of the files. This approach makes the tagging information easily portable across different devices and operating systems, just by synching the files with for example dropbox, google drive or bittorrent sync.\n", "Q: Gwibber does not respect proxy settings Is there any way to make Gwibber respect the system proxy settings? Right now, if I try setting up a Facebook account from the \"Broadcast Accounts...\" option, it comes back with an \"unable to load page\" error.\n\n\nA: This is a bug documented in launchpad: \nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/gwibber/+bug/259830\n\nA: You can use \"All Settings -> Network -> Network Proxy -> Manual\" and then after setting the desired proxy, \"Apply System Wide\". This way all Ubuntu's network traffic including Gwibber's will tunnel through your desired proxy.\n", "Q: What are the needed locales for dialog scripts to display correctly? I'm writing some custom installers that will work on Ubuntu and I'm using the dialog utility to help simplify the process of getting user input.\nSometimes, I notice that the extended ASCII that dialog outputs (such as line frames around text boxes) is not displayed correctly. (you get the circle with a question mark in it). This seems to happen when a system has been provisioned using the PXE/Netboot installer.\nI'm wondering, given that the only language I need to support is English, what locale I should check for and suggest installing prior to launching dialog?\nI've noticed this across multiple releases, my question isn't specific to a certain release.\n\nA: *\n\n*Encoding is the only part of locale that should matter in this case, make sure that it's UTF-8. \n\n*Check that the font you use in a terminal contains the line-drawing characters.\n\nA: Try \nLC_ALL=C ./yourscript.sh\n\nor \nLC_ALL=en_EN.UTF-8 ./yourscript.sh\n\nto get reliable results. At least the first one shouldn't need further installations. \n", "Q: Is it possible to set an arbitrary size for the Dash in unity? What I mean is, can I set a size that more fits my liking? Like say, 50% of the screen, 25%, etc?\n\nA: This is not possible with Unity in 11.04 or 11.10.\n", "Q: Why doesn't compiz show the outline when I use the grid? When I drag windows, instead of getting an outline like I would on a clean install, I get nothing, so I don't know what function the plugin will use before releasing the mouse, other than what I guess it will do. Is there something known to cause this to happen, and what can I do to get back the outline?\n(NB: I have the outline enabled in the plugin settings, so please do not ask me to enable it :D (lol)!)\nEDIT:\nNow I have reinstalled the compiz plugins cleanly and still noting :(. What can I do?\n\nA: I have upgraded to 11.10 and the problem is now gone. It appears to have been a localized problem with my Compiz installation.\n", "Q: Changing wireless network settings by editing files - is this possible? So I have a dilemma where my girlfriend wants to use her DS on my wireless network when she's over, but the thing is old and only supports WEP.  My network is normally WPA2 - something I'm not really comfortable with changing, for obvious reasons.  As an interim solution, I've been logging into my router, switching the settings so she could play, and then switching them back when she was done.  This has gotten old pretty fast, because every time I do it I have to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Login into the router's administrative interface\n\n*Change the settings to WEP and then reboot the device, which disconnects my laptop from the internet.\n\n*Edit the wireless settings for my network connection on my laptop\n\n*Reconnect.\n\n\nThen I have to repeat this process when I want to go back to WPA.  Obviously, this is entirely too much work.  So I decided to script it.\nTo handle the router's settings, I wrote two selenium tests - one to login to the router and switch to WEP, the other to switch back to WPA.  These are tested and work - and can be called from the command line via selenium RC.\nThe problem I'm having is the wifi settings.  I need to stop the automatic attempt at reconnection (since the saved settings will not work after the router gets switched), change the authentication type from WPA to WEP (or back again), change the password to the appropriate one and then finally reconnect.  \nSorry this has been so long winded - just trying to explain the situation to see if anyone has any alternatives to my method and also hope my desire for laziness garners some sympathy.  \nIn brief - does anyone know how I can control my wifi settings and connections via the command line?  \nI'm using ubuntu 10.10 with gnome.\nThanks!\n\nA: I would use two different ESSIDs (eg. myNetworkWpa, myNetworkWep) with different passwords and let Ubuntu reconnect automatically when either of them disappears. No need to script anything.\n\nA: Use the nmcli Network Manager Command Line Interface.\nnmcli con list gives you a list of all your known connection profiles.\nUse nmcli con up id '<Name of the connection profile goes here, e.g. Auto foo>' to connect to a given connection profile. As long as you create a separate connection profile for your router in Network Manager with different authentication setups, you can use the command above to change between them.\n", "Q: Can't change keyboard layout selection I was given an ubuntu 10.10 machine with the following weird thing: it has several 'US' keyboard layouts in list (and hotkey cycling). When I open System - Preferences - Keyboard and try to fix, I can delete extra layouts, but:\n\n\n*\n\n*GTK skin on all windows changes to something default and ugly. \n\n*After relogin, everything is back. \n\n\nI have tried applying changes system-wide and from root, changing keyboard Input Method. I have checked file access rights on my home folder are OK. Any ideas?\n\nA: If the GTK theme is changing, the most likely cause is that gnome-settings-manager is crashing. Hit Alt+F2 and type gnome-settings-manager. You should get your settings back. If not, try running gnome-settings-manager from a terminal so you can see any error messages.\nNote that this answer might not help with your original keyboard problem. But it might. And if you can confirm that gnome-settings-manager is the culprit, then you'll have a bug you can report and you'll have some more info to go on.\n", "Q: App for Syncing between Ubuntu and a very restricted Win7? I have a school issued laptop running Windows 7 on which I cannot install anything or run .exe.\nApart from just using a USB, any recommendations for syncing text files or am I dreaming?\n\nA: First: Do you have any sort of compiler on it? There is one, called Windows Power Shell, that comes integrated with Windows, some editions at least. You may learn it and create a script. \nSecond: you may use Windows Shared folder and Samba on Linux. After connection, you may use rsync on Linux to pull the data over network to your Linux machine. \nThird: Boot that laptop from LiveUSB and do what you want. \n\nA: You can give a try to services like Ubuntu One or Dropbox, you don't have to install anything if you cannot and your files are always accessible from the http interface.\n", "Q: How to show .Trash and hidden files on USB sticks but not in $HOME? In my home directory, there is a lot of files beginning with a dot, and I like the fact that Nautilus hides them. But when Nautilus hides .Trash on a USB disk, I risk leaking confidential documents inadvertently, wrongly thinking that I deleted all files from the USB stick I give to an acquaintance.\nSo, how to set Nautilus to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Hide these files in my home\n\n*But show them for USB sticks?\n\n\nAnother solution could be to disable Trash for USB sticks, but the idea is not implemented yet.\nAny alternative solution welcome. I am looking for a permanent solution, so hitting CTRL+H each time is not a solution.\n\nA: Nautilus doesn't support automatically changing settings based on the directory. You can use Ctrl+H to manually toggle between showing or not showing hidden files (usually known as dotfiles), but Nautilus can't be configured to automatically toggle that option.\nHowever, if you're using a filesystem on your flash drive that supports symlinks (not FAT32 or NTFS), you could work around your issue this way:\ncd /path/to/your/flash/drive\nln -s .Trash Trash\n\nThis way, you'll have a non-hidden directory where you can easily check the contents of your trash.\n", "Q: \"Special device does not exist\" I have 3 hard drives in my machine. Two of them are 1TB drives with my old home partition on a software RAID1. I installed an SSD as a 3rd drive with a fresh Ubuntu 10.10 currently running. I now try to mount my old home partition, which gives me an error:\n$ mount -t reiserfs /dev/sda5 /mnt/oldhome\nmount: special device /dev/sda5 does not exist\n\nfdisk shows me that all partitions are there. /dev has sda and sdb in it, but not the partitions on them.\nAny ideas?\nedit:\nblkid shows me the following:\n/dev/sda: TYPE=\"isw_raid_member\" \n/dev/sdb: TYPE=\"isw_raid_member\" \n/dev/mapper/isw_eahifbiigj_datadump1: UUID=\"247dbff9-236f-4fa7-a0d4-1f060d973a3e\" TYPE=\"reiserfs\" \n/dev/sdc1: UUID=\"6ba699d7-caaa-4a87-9deb-e7aca73984de\" TYPE=\"ext4\"\n\nI can mount the third one, which contains some orphaned partition, living on sda1.\n\nA: DM-RAID (the variant of RAID in use here, sometimes also known as SATA RAID, BIOS RAID, or fake RAID) creates a separate device for the whole array and suppresses the partitions for the component devices.  In other words, /dev/sda5 is only the redundant half of your old home partition on your first disk, rather than the whole thing.\nOn Ubuntu 10.10, I believe that partition 5 of your array should be on /dev/mapper/isw_eahifbiigj_datadump15.  From Ubuntu 11.04, this will move to /dev/mapper/isw_eahifbiigj_datadump1p5.\n\nA: Fixed similar problem by changing the mount line in /etc/fstab from /dev/mapper/isw_Volume01 to /dev/mapper/isw_Volume0p1\nNOTE! The extra small \"p\" in there. I.e Volume01 -> Volume0p1\n", "Q: Where is my cronlog? \nPossible Duplicate:\nWhere is the cron / crontab log? \n\nWhile trying to Google this a lot of sources claims there's a cron log in /var/log but I have none.

I hope that solves the problem, however I can only be sure after testing for few days...Will update the situation.\nUPDATE: Nope no progress, got the update but the problem persists. But it seems to be a lot less frequent than it used to be. I am following up this question as some people suggested me to re-install but now I face Unity freezes after compiz configuration change\n\nA: This is a bug. \n\nA: That can be video driver crashing. What is your video card? Do you use proprietary driver? If yes, try another version, or try removing it completely. \nOr, unfortunately, it can be many others pieces of hardware. X server is a colossus on clay legs, and most vulnerable to hardware faults. Check you memory (memtest86), HDD (fsck, smart), temperatures (lm-sensors). Try switching off all unnecessary hardware and software. I had seen X server crashes when EiskalDC++ tried to index a 100Gb file, for example. \nHave you read logs, dmesg? Anything suspicious? \nP.S. Turn off compiz. It is on by default in ubuntu. \n\nA: Are you using Unity or GNOME? Try the other. If that doesn't work, I would suggest Try Xubuntu (to see if it is GNOME). If all that fails, Backup your home partition or folder, and copy /var/cache/apt to another folder, and re-install. Use the Packages from the cache to re-install your applications.\n\nA: Try (in a Terminal, without SUDO):\nunity --reset\n\nand then don't touch CCSM (Compiz Settings) again. I don't know if this really helps in your case but I'm in the same situation and currently testing if the crashes still occur.\n", "Q: Modify manually PWM of my fan (fan speed) I configured fanspeed but it detects only one \"temp\" captor...\nIn Gnome Sensors applet, I can see the temperature of three captors...\nThe one of my GPU is 75°,\n62° for my hard disk\nand 32° for my motherboard...\nI would like to increase the speed of the fans, just with a command in the terminal... It is possible ?\nI know that there is a material solution (buttons on the computer to increase / decrease fans speed), but I'd like to do it with the terminal =)\nThank you !\n\nA: Packages like lm-sensors and fancontrol can help you do this safely. If you really want to do it yourself, you can probably find special device files named pwm1, pwm2, etc. in /sys/class/hwmon/*/device/. You can cat them to get the current value or write a number between 0 and 255 to change the fan speed. (But be careful. You can really fry your hardware!)\nIt's much easier to just use pwmconfig from the fancontrol package. Run sensors-detect from the lm-sensors package first so that you can see the current temperature and RPM by running watch sensors.\n", "Q: Error when starting BitCoin I just installed Bitcoin and everything seemed to be going well. After a few days the client stopped loading at boot and instead gave this error:\n\nDB_RUNRECOVERY: Fatal error, run\n  database recovery        bitcoin in\n  CMyApp::OnUnhandledException()\n\nAnyone know how I can run the db recovery or other ways to rectify the error?\n\nA: To summarise the conclusion of that thread, you should begin by making a full backup.  Then, once you are sure your backup is secure, you can delete everything except the wallet.dat file in the ~/.bitcoin folder.  This will cause BitCoin to re-download the block chain and restore the local block database.  Don't panic if it initially shows a zero balance after restarting--it won't show your correct balance until it's downloaded the relevant blocks.\nOn a side note, this is also the safest way to perform an upgrade to a new version of the BitCoin software--backup everything, then delete everything except the wallet.dat file.  When you run the new version of bitcoin, your balance will appear once it finishes downloading the blockchain.\nDon't forget to head over to the BitCoin StackExchange proposal to lend your support and vote on sample questions!  It would be great to have a single place for BitCoin Q&A across multiple platforms and scenarios.\n\nA: WARNING: Before doing anything, backup your Bitcoin files!

What is wrong in this case? Thank you in advance. \n\nA: It seems like you don't have permissions to execute the script. There are two possible solutions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Prefix the command with python,\ne. g. python /path/to/myscript.py\ninstead of /path/to/myscript.py.\nThat way, the python interpreter\nwill read your script instead of the\nexecuted script calling the python\ninterpreter, and the permissions on\nthe script may stay the same.\n\n*Enable execution-permissions for\n    the script. Right-click the script\n    in the file manager, choose\n    properties and tick the execution\n    permission under the permissions\n    tab. This solution implies that your script can be identified by the shell as a python-script.

I'm testing my app in Natty 2nd beta, in which most applications are showing the new overlay scroolbars, I guess only non-native GTK apps can't show it (like LibreOffice or Firefox).\nMy app is coded using Python and pygtk so I thought the overlay scrollbars should be enabled by default but I was wrong. I tried to set the environment variable LIBOVERLAY_SCROLLBAR to 1 in both terminal (previously to the app command) and inside the python code via os.putenv(), but it's still showing the old-fashioned scrollbars.\nWhat am I doing wrong?\n\nA: You should use gtk_scrolled_window widget because is the only widget that support overlay scrollbars.\nSource https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Ayatana/ScrollBars\nIf it doesn't work try with:\nsudo su\necho \"export LIBOVERLAY_SCROLLBAR=1\" > /etc/X11/Xsession.d/80overlayscrollbars\n\n", "Q: How do I disable Munin? My laptop (Ubuntu 10.10) takes a really long time to start up. Watching top, one of the things it seems to be spending a lot of time on is Munin. I'm trying to sort out what might depend on it and/or how to disable it most of the time.\n\nA: I would remove it using sudo apt-get remove munin. \nMunin is a server and network monitoring tool.  I wouldn't consider a laptop an appropriate place to install it.  As it is designed to collect data every five minutes and generate graphs of the current status, a device which is not always on is not that suitable.  Munin uses a web interface for reporting.  \nIf you use you laptop unplugged, munin will suck a lot of power regenerating graphs every five minutes.\nEDIT: munin-node is daemon but doesn't do anything unless it has a client.  Disabling it will just make life miserable for munin.\nmunin is there is not an /etc/init.d script or /etc/init configuration.  munin and a munin-node job are run every 5 minutes as cron jobs using files in /etc/cron.d.  You need to remove these files or comment out the cron entries to disable the processes.  It may be possible to disable the scripts buy giving them and extension like .disabled.\n\nA: Munin appears to be a network monitoring tool, likely what you're seeing on start up is it preparing it's buckets for trapping and logging network connectivity. This is likely installed alongside some kind of \"webhosting\" control panel, etc. The default installation of the Ubuntu Desktop does not use it though. If this isn't something you use, you should be able to disable it via the commandline by removing it from the update-rc.d\nDisable autostart for a service without uninstalling?\n\nA: This was helpful: Disable autostart for a service without uninstalling? \nHowever, I realized that what I was looking for was apt-cache rdepends munin and apt-cache rdepends munin-node -- those let me establish that it wasn't a known dependency.\n", "Q: Network icon shows an Internet connection, while ping does not I am an Ubuntu user for the last couple of years.\nRecently facing problem to connect my new laptop into the Internet. I have an ISP connection which provide me a NAT address.\nI changed all the information in network configuration.The network icon shows it is connected to Internet but when I browse, ping shows no Internet connection.\n/etc/network/interfaces look like this:\nauto eth0\niface eth0 inet static\naddress 192.168.100.118(put you internet address provided by the ISP)\ngateway 192.168.100.1(gateway address)\nnetmask 255.255.255.0\nnetwork 192.168.100.0\n\nAnd when I ping my DNS server IP get the reply from DNS server.\nI can not understand the problem,it should be mentioned that I also changed the Physical address of my laptop for using the existing connection.\nIn windows the connection is working fine.\nAny suggestion in this question will help me a lot.\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: You indicate a static IP, but the profile has no name servers listed... that is the base problem.  I'm not familiar with the file you show, but would guess it needs a line like below.  What I show below is the old-school way to put it directly into the resolv.conf file.\nIf ping by IP address works, but names do not work, then look in the file /etc/resolve.conf\nAt a minimum this file must contain at least one line like:\nnameserver 54.23.123.4\nI made that number up, so don't use it.  If there are no lines (up to 3) that start with the word \"nameserver\", or if the IP that is given is wrong, then, that is the problem.\nIf you know the IP of one or more of your name servers, the just add one to three of these lines and it should work right away.  Note that you must be root or use sudo to do this.  Also, use a text editor, not a word processor (or save as plain text).\nNote, if you should use DHCP instead of a static IP, the DHCP client should over right this file upon making the connection and should put the nameserver lines in it as per the numbers told to it by your ISP's DHCP server.  So do not be surprised if this file gets over written.\n", "Q: Can I throttle Liferea? After I log in, my laptop takes a really long time to load. Watching top, it seems like one thing that is using a ton of juice is Liferea. I do want it to sync my feeds, but I'm wondering if there's a good way to throttle it so that it doesn't use more memory than I have to spare. \n\nA: If the problem primarily happens during login, one option is to delay Liferea until the rest of the login processes have quieted down:\n\n\n*\n\n*How can I reduce the time taken to login by postponing/delaying some startup applications?\nIf the problem is solely due to CPU usage, consider running Lifearea under cpulimit:\n\n\n*\n\n*Can I limit the CPU usage of a single application?\n\nA: It would be better to start liferea manually, instead of starting it with the system, that way it won't put a drag on the system.\nYou can also set Liferea to only load feeds manually as opposed to automatically updating (in the preferences).\n", "Q: How can I remove duplicate icons for \"launched\" java programs in the launcher? When launching java programs (like IntelliJ IDEA and Crashplan) in Natty's Unity launcher, duplicate icons are shown (see image).  For IntelliJ I created the .desktop file, for Crashplan the .desktop file is supplied with the application.  Is there something that can be changed in the .desktop files (or somewhere else) that can prevent this from occurring?  I couldn't find a bug report for unity itself but programs like Gnome-Do/Docky have bug reports and had to make internal changes to their applications to prevent this.\n In this image the 1st icon is the one created from the .desktop file and the second icon is after launching it.

Use xprop command to get this class. For example : \n$ xprop|grep WM_CLASS\n WM_CLASS(STRING) = \"sun-awt-X11-XFramePeer\", \"java-lang-Thread\"\n\n$ cat /usr/share/applications/PHPStorm.desktop | grep StartupWM\nStartupWMClass=sun-awt-X11-XFramePeer\n\nMore deatils in this thread (this about AWN, but works for Unity too)\n\nA: I was able to fix this for SQLDeveloper, which is a java program:\nUsing xprop (and then clicking on the SQLDeveloper window), I found the following line of output:\nWM_CLASS(STRING) = \"sun-awt-X11-XFramePeer\", \"oracle-ide-boot-Launcher\"\n\nBased on the comments found above and in https://bugs.launchpad.net/unity/+bug/757991, I added the following line to my local sqldeveloper.desktop file:\nStartupWMClass=oracle-ide-boot-Launcher\n\n\nA: I've documented the fix for Eclipse 4.x and 3.x here.\nThis solution is for glx-dock aka Cairo-dock but works for all task bars relying on WM_CLASS.\nIn the case of eclipse, the launch is a two step process as well.\n        \nBasically, what you need to do is to identify Eclipse branding plugin.xml applicable to your Eclipse version and modify the application name property.  When the workbench main windows is created, Jface will call the SWT Display.setName and this will set you WM_CLASS.  If this is the declared WM_CLASS for your launcher, then running instances will find their dock launcher.\nDon't forget to do eclipse -clean on the first time.\nTabbing through is also much improved.\n\n\nA: IntelliJ IDEA is started by a script ($IDEA_HOME/bin/idea.sh). When its launcher is clicked, the script is executed, which starts a java executable and immediately exits. Unity notices that the application you started (the script) has already exited - that's why there is no indicator on the first IDEA icon. However, there is an other (from the executable started by the launcher) application running at the moment - and that's why the second IDEA icon is shown. \nI hope the fix for this behavior will be implemented soon - but it is not a very straightforward one. It would have to involve a hand-maintained list associations between windows and launchers they should be associated with.\n\nA: For CrashPlan, you can try moving your app file CrashPlan.desktop to /usr/share/applications. Only apps that live there can be locked into the launcher.\nsudo mv ~/Desktop/CrashPlan.desktop /usr/share/applications/.\n\nThen try using the dash to run CrashPlan.\nYou might be able to do something similar with IntelliJ IDEA, but since it's running a script, I'm not sure if it will work correctly.\n\nA: None of the other answers worked for me, but in the end I actually found an even simpler solution.\nOpen up Intellij-Idea, and on the top bar find the tools dropdown menu. Then, select the Create Desktop Entry button. It'll create a properly working .desktop entry in your .local/share/applications folder, which should get recognized by whatever desktop environment you're using. It doesn't make a duplicate icon, and you can even change the icon if you want. \nUnfortunately, using the nosplash argument brings back the duplicate icon problem, so I'm not sure how to fix that.\n\nA: After installing IntelliJ IDEA 2017.2.5 under Ubuntu 17.04 (with Numix icons) I had to change the line StartupWMClass=jetbrains-idea to StartupWMClass=jetbrains-idea-ce in the program's .desktop file so the duplicate icon would disappear.\nI guess \"ce\" stands for Community Edition which I have, so I don't know why the value of this property in the .desktop file was originally not having the \"ce\" suffix.\n", "Q: Ubuntu doesn't boot after kernel update After the update to latest kernel (2.6.32-31-generic), when I start my PC, all I get is the grub2 prompt.

If so, how do I fix this? \n\nA: You can always install different versions of Python, they will coexist happily, just make sure you do not override the standard location (i.e. choose a different installation root directory).\nFor general use, make sure the old ones are generally not in your PATH.\nWhen you need to test you GAE development, add the path to the 2.5 version and to GAE root directory in front of your PATH and you are set. For this to be convenient, I have created a function (could be an alias) in my .bashrc to change my PATH variable. Works like a charm.\nfunction add_path\n{\n  (echo $PATH | fgrep \"$1\" >/dev/null) || export PATH=\"$1:$PATH\"\n}\n\nfunction gae\n{\n  GAE=\"(G)\"\n  add_path /usr/local/share/Python-2.5.5/\n  add_path /usr/local/share/google_appengine/\n}\n\nOf course locations may differ in your system.\nI use the GAE variable in my PS1 so that I know when I have used that function - and I have a visual reminder to tell me I am set for GAE (i.e. I use the old Python version).\n", "Q: Switching by hotkeys between workspaces with VirtualBox instance I faced following usability issue:\nwhen have one of workspaces with focused VirtualBox instance within it,that can't switch between workspaces by Super+E or by Ctrl+Alt+Arrow.\nIs it possible to solve it? (VirtualBox is Win XP guest edition and Kubuntu,host is Ubuntu 10.10)\n\nA: Press the \"host key\" (by default: right Control on PC; left Command key on Mac)\nThe host key gives the control of the keyboard to the host which makes it possible to easy change desktop with Ctrl+Alt+Arrow etc.\nMore can be read on: https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch01.html\n\nA: In Virtual Box Manager select Preferences -> Input and deselect Auto Capture Keyboard to prevent the virtual machine to capture all keystrokes of the host when activated:\n\n", "Q: Is there a way to blacklist an individual application from using overlay-scrollbars? I am having problems with some programs when using overlay-scrollbars, mainly Code::Blocks and Eclipse. \nI've found several ways of disabling the overlay scrollbars completely, for all applications, but I like them and I don't want to do this.\nIs there a way to blacklist only this applications from using the new scrollbars?\n\nA: A more generic alternative to the above answers would be this simple script that I called \"regular-scrollbars\":\n#!/bin/sh\nLIBOVERLAY_SCROLLBAR=0 \"$1\"\n\nSave that someplace on your path, and then you can use the menu editor to add \"regular-scrollbars\" before any command you want (as long as it only has one argument - try \"$@\" if you think you'll need more than one). \nThis means you won't have to make a new script for any other programs you want to revert to the old scrollbars.\nI really like the bashrc alias example too though, you could probably make it more generic by providing a list of programs you want to revert and having bashrc loop over them, adding the aliases.\n\nA: I am going to answer my own question. Thanks to the user \"SevenMachines\" in ubuntuforums, I've found a way to disable overlay scrollbars for a specific application.\nI did a shell script with the following (for eclipse, for example):\n#!/bin/sh\nLIBOVERLAY_SCROLLBAR=0 eclipse\n\nThen, make it executable, and using the \"Menu editor\", changed eclipse to point to the script.\n\nA: Alternatively, in your .bashrc add the following\nalias eclipse=\"LIBOVERLAY_SCROLLBAR=0 eclipse\"\n\nIn fact, you may also want to add UBUNTU_MENUPROXY=0 so unity menus work properly with eclipse, so that becomes:\nalias eclipse=\"UBUNTU_MENUPROXY=0 LIBOVERLAY_SCROLLBAR=0 eclipse\"\n\n[Note: that this will only take effect once you restart your bash shell]\n\nA: You could edit the .desktop File like this:\ncp /usr/share/applications/eclipse.desktop ~/.local/share/applications/\n\n...then put...\nenv LIBOVERLAY_SCROLLBAR=0\n\nto the Exec Field that the file looks afterwards like this:\n[Desktop Entry]\nCategories=Development;IDE;Java;\nComment=Eclipse Integrated Development Environment\nExec=env LIBOVERLAY_SCROLLBAR=0 eclipse\nIcon=eclipse\nName=Eclipse\nTerminal=false\nType=Application\n\nI use the unity-launcher-editor to easily change this via a GUI.\n\nA: /usr/bin/eclipse is a start script by itself. You can edit this in a text editor and add the following lines (the same as mentioned in other answers), below the line GDK_NATIVE_WINDOWS=true.\nexport UBUNTU_MENUPROXY=0\nexport LIBOVERLAY_SCROLLBAR=0\n\n\nA: I have got the following working in Ubuntu 14.04 with Eclipse Mars 4.5.2, thanks to http://osdir.com/ml/ubuntu-bugs/2015-05/msg10672.html\n$ more ~/.local/share/applications/eclipse.desktop\n[Desktop Entry]\nType=Application\nName=Eclipse\nComment=Eclipse Integrated Development Environment\nIcon=/opt/eclipse/icon.xpm\nExec=env LIBOVERLAY_SCROLLBAR=0 SWT_GTK3=0 /opt/eclipse/eclipse\nTerminal=false\nCategories=Development;IDE;Java;\n\n\nA: For the specific issue of overlay scrollbars in Eclipse, I was able to get them working properly by following the instructions in this blog post and a related Ubuntu question.\nYou edit the eclipse launch script.\nsudo gedit /usr/bin/eclipse\n\nAnd comment out an environment variable that is working around some old bugs that are supposedly now fixed.\n#export GDK_NATIVE_WINDOWS=true\n\nThe next time I launched Eclipse, the scroll bars worked.\n", "Q: Is there an upstart event for files systems that get mounted manually? There is the mounted event in upstart, but it is emitted only when the mountall daemon mounts the devices found in /etc/fstab at startup.\nAre there any events that get emitted, when I mount a device afterwards manually using the mount command or by calling an API?\nIf not, what would be a suitable workaround?\n\nA: No, calling mount directly does not cause any Upstart events to be emitted.  However, you can use initctl emit to emit the events of your choice.  See the initctl(8) manual page.\n", "Q: How to set a password for workspaces? Is it possible to set a password for workspaces?Such that if i switch from one workspace to another it should prompt for password.\n\nA: I don't believe this is possible with current window managers.\nYour best bet (if you use compiz) would be to write a compiz plugin, but I can't think of any other straight forward solutions.\n", "Q: How to create bash file and allow it to accept an argument from the terminal? In recall for nostalgic feelings, I've remembered the .bat files on DOS. :)\nHere's the thing:\nEach time I need to generate a documentation for a given web application I have to:\nsudo phpdoc -o HTML:frames:earthli -d public_html/yoursite.dev/application/ -t public_html/yoursite.dev/docs/\nis there a way to make a shortcut to the above, so that, we can type only:\nsudo generateDoc.sh -a yoursite.dev\n\nor even better:\nsudo generateDoc.sh -theVariableThatNeedsTobeChangedOnBashHere\n\nSo that, if we have yoursite.dev passed on the command line, the bash will have yoursite.dev, if we write yoursite2.dev then, the bash would have yoursite2.dev and so on... \nAny clue?\nThanks a lot.\n\nA: Try this:\n#!/bin/bash\nphpdoc -o HTML:frames:earthli -d public_html/\"$1\"/application/ \\\n    -t public_html/\"$1\"/docs/\n\nCall it as sudo ./script.sh yoursite.\n\nA: You can also place this function in your .bashrc:\ngenerateDocs() {\n    sudo phpdoc -o HTML:frames:earthli \\\n                -d \"public_html/$1/application/\" \\\n                -t \"public_html/$1/docs/\"\n}\n\nthen\ngenerateDocs yoursite.dev\n\n\nA: Here's an example script I wrote. The $* means \"all the arguments passed\". Importantly, they're in quotes because otherwise white space would break the command. Quodlibet is a sweet music library/player, btw.\njake@daedalus:~$ cat bin/play\n#!/bin/bash\nquodlibet --query \"$*\"\nquodlibet --next\njake@daedalus:~$ play garrison keillor rhubarb pie\n\nLike Fido said, don't forget to set the file as executable with chmod +x programName.\nSomething you might consider is making a bin directory in your home folder and adding it to your $PATH. Then you can call the command no matter what folder you're in. I have this line in my .bashrc: PATH=$HOME/bin:$PATH. If you don't do this, you have use an absolute or relative path when you call your script, ie:\njake@daedalus:/usr/local/share/docs$ /home/jake/bin/play foo fighters everlong\njake@daedalus:~/bin$ ./play placebo where is my mind\n\nI highly recommend Grymoire's guide to SH scripting. What you're needing to do is use the shell's Positional Parameters to take arguments and insert them into your command. There's also TLDP's more in depth treatment of BASH's Positional Parameters. I'd start with Grymoire's, and then read through TLDP when you're ready for a more advanced treatment of the subject.\n\nA: Open your favorite text editor, paste the following:\nargs=(\"$@\")\nsudo phpdoc -o HTML:frames:earthli -d public_html/${args[0]}/application/ -t public_html/${args[0]}/docs/\n\nand save it as (in this case) 'generateDoc.sh'. The next thing to do is to give execution rights to your file, so open a terminal, and run: $ chmod +x generateDoc.sh\nNow all you need to do is call the file: $ ./generateDoc.sh yoursite.dev there's no need for sudo here, because it's already inside the sh file.\nHope this helps!\n", "Q: My infopanel screenlet is blinking all the time Installed screenlets and infopanel but it is blinking all the time.

You can use the other Icon Theme as a base and just replace the icons you want to replace. This way users can select your theme or the standard theme if they wish, and even change the \"inherit\" variable to the theme of their choice.\n", "Q: Monitor Calibration software I was wondering if there is any software for monitor calibration available for ubuntu?

I know these are available on the monitors themselves, but I hate clicking around. Anything specific for users with nvidia cards?\nPlease and thank you.\n\nA: What exactly do you mean by monitor calibration?  It's impossible to calibrate a monitor with software alone, you need a color measuring instrument for that (which is an rather expensive tool).\nIf you really want to calibrate your monitor, there is GNOME Color Manager and the commandline tool ArgyllCMS (the former uses the latter for doing the actual calibration).\nsudo apt-get install gnome-color-manager argyll\n\nGNOME Color Manager shows up in the system configuration as \"Color Profiles\" (or something similar translated in your language).\n\nA: nvidia-settings may be what you're looking for.

Please choose Ubuntu Classic at the login screen and you will be using the traditional environment.\"\n\nA: I was having the same problem and I have found a simple solution.  The \"problem\" appears to be that the nvidia driver does not support hybrid graphics cards, or NVIDIA Optimus.  \nIf you go into the bios and turn off Optimus and force the system to use the discrete graphics card, unity will work and X will perform much better.  (note: you will be sacrificing battery life)\n(oops this is the Christian K from the other answer.  Ignore that answer.)\n\nA: Hybrid graphics has improved a bit lately.

Fast performance, bad power usage.\nOr if you delete the Nvidia driver in Ubuntu, then in the BIOS choose Integrated, the Intel driver is used and you get Unity. Less performance, better power usage.\nThe issue is that with the 3rd option, Optimus, the nouveau driver is used, doesn't know which card to use, and end up disabling the 3D acceleration, which kills Unity (in Ubuntu 11.10, you would get Unity-2D instead).\nIn the BIOS of the T420, in Config > Graphics, there is also an option to force the use of the discrete card instead of Optimus if the OS does not support it. Unfortunately this doesn't work, even when enabled, Optimus is used. (Tested with dualboot using BOOTMGR booting Grub2. Can someone confirm with Ubuntu and Grub2 only?)\nThere is a bug for this:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/nvidia-graphics-drivers/+bug/775862\nThere is a project to support Optimus for Linux:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://github.com/MrMEEE/bumblebee\nThe mailing list for group: \n\n\n*\n\n*http://launchpad.net/~hybrid-graphics-linux\nsuggest that it is already working. \n\nA: In additional to selecting the discrete graphics (or integrated graphics) instead of hybrid you also have to turn off the OS detection of the graphics. Those two should force you to the discrete or integrated graphics only. \n\nA: Have you tried installing the restricted driver from Nvidia via terminal window?\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Control pannel aka \"System Settings\"\n\n*Select \"additional drivers\"\n\n*Select the Nvidia driver\n\n\nTo install latest -\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-x-swat/x-updates\n\nsudo apt-get update\n\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-current\n\n", "Q: How does the docky show desktop Docklet work Docky has the feature of tiling/cascading the desktop.

I have used 10.10 as long as i have used ubuntu and I have not upgraded yet.  I have tons of files and applications on this computer and I really don't want to have to reinstall them and copy them.  Will all of my applications and settings be saved by and upgrade and will all of my files be saved and carry over to the new version?  Also is it really worth it to upgrade or should I really just wipe clean with a fresh installation.  Even if you think I should wipe clean I would like too know whether or not I my files would be saved and my applications and settings would be saved.  Thank you.\n\nA: All your data, settings and all applications still present in the 11.04 repository (so probably all of them, seeing as you started out with 10.10) will carry over with an upgrade.\nAnswers to the question of upgrading or installing from scratch: Is it better to upgrade through the Update Manager or re-install from scratch?\n", "Q: What's the best, most compatible sub-$100 graphics card for Natty? Since upgrading to Natty graphic performance has been absolutely terrible despite having decent system specs. I'm willing to buy a new card if it will make the interface fast again. Can someone suggest a card that will perform well and be totally compatible out of the box with Natty?\n\nA: If you want a truly \"Out of the box\" experience you should buy any Intel Graphics Adapter (this also applies if you don't like proprietary drivers).\nIf you prefer a bit more performance and accept an \"Out of the box in the second attempt\" experience you should consider buying a Nvidia or ATI card (the only thing needed here is to install the proprietary driver on the first start).\nIn my experience a Pentium IV 2800MHz with 1GB of ram and a Nvidia 6200 AGP works smoothly with Natty (as you can see it's a five/six year old computer).\n\nA: Simply look for nVidia cards because they are a lot better supported. You'll get better experience and drivers will be more commonly updated. I have ATI and i am not happy..ever.\n", "Q: How to add vpn connections while using connman I was trying out Connman yesterday. My wireless Internet connected fine, however, I was not able to find any option for VPNs. Is there not option to connect to VPNs through Connman GUI? The website says, it supports VPN.\n\nA: OK. Found the answer. All protocols are supported but none has a GUI. I was able to to connect successfully to cisco vpn using vpnc-connect while running connman.\n\nA: There is an open bug titled VPN is not supported on Connman on Launchpad, so I guess the short answer is yes, but limited to openconnect. At least when the bug was fild in may yesteryear. However, patches for more broader support has appeared on the mailing lists since the bug was filed, so you may have more luck with a newer version of connman.

To what format and how can I convert HTML file in order to translate it with Lokalize application?\n\nA: You can also use the xml2po tool to convert the HTML page to a .po or .pot file in gettext format, which you can then load and translate with Lokalize. Once translated, you can use the same tool to build the translated HTML pages. There are a couṕle of examples of invokation when you call the xml2po --help command.\nYou'll need to install the gnome-doc-utils package to use the xml2po tool\n\nA: You can use OmegaT for translating those kind of files.\nhttp://www.omegat.org/\n\nA: You have to create a project in Lokalize and add the HTML file to this project.

I'm new to Ubuntu and i'm amazed that open source alternatives to my Windows apps like GIMP, Amarok, Libreoffice, Cheese etc are so much smaller than their Windows compatriots (MS Office, Photoshop, Youcam etc). Ubuntu has to be the best evolution ever! And the best after all these is that it's completely free   \n\nA: You mean smaller on disk? Probably thanks to the extensive use of dynamically linked libraries, that are shared between multiple applications. Of course Windows also supports that, but DLLs aren't easily versioned, and the risk of \"DLL hell\" doesn't encourage sharing.\n\nA: There's a number of possible reasons which cannot be valid in general though. The bigger sized software might have more features. Or more cruft. Or both. Or the open source software is just so much more cleverly engineered than its counterpart. Some or all of these may be the reasons in any given case. Or not.\nOne general reason would be the benefits of centralized software distribution and dependency resolution. In most open source based operating system environments, when a software is installed which depends on other software packages (as is most often the case, e.g. an executable depends on libraries etc.), those dependencies are installed as well - if they haven't been already. So they are installed once, max.\nWithout centralized software distribution and dependency resolution (e.g. in Windows) such dependencies may often be packaged with the software that needs them. So dependency X may be packaged with software A as well as with B (and C and D and so on) -> same dependencies installed multiple times (or even statically linked into the executable) - just to be on the safe side.\nSo that might account for some of the differences in size. Surely not all though.\n", "Q: How do I import a public key?

I was reading today the latest Canonical design blog post where I was kind of surprised that one should be able to right click on the desktop to change the wallpaper. I am running the most updated version of natty and have the latest unity package installed (3.8.10) but right clicking on the desktop brings nothing on my machine. On the other hand, when I right click on any launcher icon I do get a quick list, so I know it's not a problem with my mouse or something. Is this a known bug?\nI tried to kill Nautilus as Nathan suggested using Alt+F2 and then killall nautilus. Just to be sure, I then opened a terminal window and typed the same command again. Got the response nautilus: no process found (I figured that my first try to kill nautilus worked then. Just to be on the safe side, I clicked the \"Home\" icon on my launcher to start Nautilus, and then killed it again (same command). Still nothing happened.\nFollowing some of the comments below, I should specify that I do have ubuntu-desktop installed (and updated version 1.220) and nautilus is indeed installed (Version: 1:2.32.2.1-0ubuntu13). (Used to have nautilus from the elementary PPA, but removed it following the comments below - still no luck).\n\nA: It is highly unlikely the N.E. is a real problem.\nEnsure that:\n/apps/nautilus/preferences/show_desktop\n\n(run gconf-editor)\nIs set to true. If it is, also ensure that nautilus is set to launch on login.\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I use the gconf editor?\n\nA: The desktop is actually provided by Nautilus, just like it was in previous versions of Ubuntu.  If you press  Alt+F2 and type killall nautilus without the quotes and then press Enter, this will stop (and automatically restart) Nautilus.  \nWhat happens when you right-click on your desktop then?\n\nA: If you have gnome tweak tool installed, go ahead and press Alt+F2, type in \"Gnome Tweak\" and you should see a tweak tool. Open that, go to the desktop section and turn on Desktop. Worked for me.\n\nA: Check the \"Mouse Click Emulation\" settings in the Gnome Tweaks tool (under the keyboard and mouse tab).\nYou may find that your mouse is set up to emulate a right click by clicking the touchpad with 2 fingers.\n", "Q: Choosing GDM login window theme via GUI without Ubuntu Tweak Is there any way to (via the GUI) modify the theme that is used for the GDM login system?

Is there any easy method to have multiple GDM themes installed at once, but be able to choose which theme takes dominance in the login manager without removing all other theme packages?\n\nA: First approach \nIf you don't like Ubuntu Tweak, may be you like the GDM2 Setup tool:  \nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:gdm2setup/gdm2setup\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install python-gdm2setup  \n\n\nSecond approach \nTheeMahn has made a Nautilus script that help you to easily make your GDM theme:  \ncd ~/.gnome2/nautilus-scripts/\nwget http://ubuntusoftware.info/scripts/MakeGDM\nsudo chmod +x MakeGDM \n\n \n \n\n\nA: Since the time of this thread being posted, I have switched to using KDE as my primary environment, and have been able to successfully theme the KDM login window.\nI will mark @desgua's answer as the accepted answer, but I wanted to make a note that I switched.\n", "Q: Ubuntu tells me I have packages to upgrade when I don't I have a server machine that I never log into the X display on, only via ssh.  Recently I logged in and it told me I had \n12 packages can be updated.\n6 updates are security updates.\n\nI actually already knew that because I run munin on it and all my other servers.  So anyway, I did \"sudo aptitude\" and installed all the updates, then rebooted.  A few days later, munin told me I needed to upgrade another package, so I logged on, but the login message said:\n12 packages can be updated.\n6 updates are security updates.\n\nI went into aptitude and installed the one update.  Ubuntu is still telling me I have 12 packages to update.  Munin tells I don't have any.  I tried aptitude -d -y dist-upgrade and apt-get -d -y dist-upgrade and both of them tell me there is nothing to install.  So why is the login information still telling me I have 12 packages to update?\n\nA: The problem appears to be the logic in  /usr/lib/update-notifier/update-motd-updates-available which is deciding that there are is no reason to run /usr/lib/update-notifier/apt-check --human-readable based on timestamps on /var/lib/update-notifier/updates-available and sources.list and a few other files.\nI'm not sure what the actual bug is, but removing the cached file has at least reset it to 0 updates, although God only knows if it will show the correct number when there are updates available.\n\nA: I've recently answered a similar question on Serverfault:\nubuntu server: SSH banner telling to update packages but nothing to update\nThat banner you're talking about is called MOTD (Message Of The Day). It appears to be a bug which can be work-arounded by deleting the /etc/motd.tail file.\n\nA: It's a bug in initscripts, fixed in Natty, which copies the current state of motd to /etc/motd.tail. motd is dynamically generated whenever you boot but motd.tail is static (allowing a sysadmin to place some fixed information there for all users).\nDeleting motd.tail will fix the issue temporarily but a better solution is to create an empty motd.tail. If the file doesn't exist then it may be created again (incorrectly) when initscripts is upgraded.\nCreate an empty motd.tail with\nsudo touch /etc/motd.tail\n\n\nA: Check if /etc/motd.tail contains the update messages. If yes, remove them.\n\nA: I am having the same issue on 10.04.2.\n# aptitude install update-motd\n\nSelecting previously deselected package update-motd.\n(Reading database ... 36453 files and directories currently installed.)\nUnpacking update-motd (from .../update-motd_3.5-0ubuntu1_all.deb) ...\n Removing any system startup links for /etc/init.d/update-motd ...\nSetting up update-motd (3.5-0ubuntu1) ...\n\nBut there's no update-motd command line tool afterwords and I can't find anything about pam_motd.\nRemoving the /etc/motd made the message go away, but obviously the safe-upgrade should have already done that.\n\nA: On several systems I had seen incorrect reports of packages to be updated, but also 2 lines 'Ubuntu 10.04.2 LTS' and 'Ubuntu 10.04.1 LTS' even though I was on 10.04.2.\nAs Karl said, /etc/motd.tail contained the old text, and deleting it solved the problem for me perfectly\n", "Q: How could I begin C++ programming on Ubuntu? I recently switched to Ubuntu from Windows 7. I was previously learning C++ with Microsoft's IDE, Visual Studio. \n\n\n*\n\n*How would I go about programming C++ on Ubuntu, preferably with an IDE?\n\n\nA: I recommend you to use QtCreator or NetBeans - you should try them and you will see that these 2 IDE's are the best for C++ development. Geany, Aptana(which is actually intended for Web Development) and Codeblocks are not good when you try them all, I assure you.\nP.S: Don't listen to guys that tell you that you are not a good programmer if you write programms in IDE's, that's just plain stupid and childish(when they grow up they won't think like this any more). The IDE's don't write the code for you...\nTo add, even some Linux Kernel developers switched to Qt Creator. Valve and a lot of other big names in the industry use Qt Creator for C and/or C++ development on Linux.\n\nA: You have the standard gcc that comes with Ubuntu. Just ALT+F2 and type gnome-terminal or press CTRL+ALT+T to start a console.\nTo start programming in the console, just type nano test.c; that way you start working on your first test.c file. Try this:\n#include <stdio.h>\nint main ()\n{\nprintf(\"Hello AskUbuntu!\");\n}\n\nthen just press CTRL+X and press Y, then ENTER to save and close.\nCompile this test.c file using gcc by typing: gcc test.c -o mytest, which will create a file called mytest (which is executable by typing ./mytest) using the code from test.c.\nThe same can be said for C++ code. It works the same way as gcc: Compiling a test.cpp file using g++ by typing: g++ test.cpp -o mytest, which will create a file called mytest (which is executable by typing ./mytest) using the code from test.cpp.\nThis is one way.\nAnother way I recommend is using Code::Blocks which has been known to work since I have tested it (Ubuntu 8.04, 8.10, 9.04, 9.10, 10.04 and 10.10). Works right out the box, no errors, no nothing. The one I have used so far was Code::Blocks 8.02 but 10.05 came out a couple of months ago and it looks good.\nYou can install it by running sudo apt-get install codeblocks.\nThe last method I recommend is Aptana, which is a complete GUI IDE system. Aptana is very complex and will certainly resolve any doubt you have with its complete help system and autocomplete, autohelp way of working. Aptana is much better than the IDE from Microsoft let me tell you right now. Already worked on both for some time now and I will not leave Aptana for big works.\nI will leave here some links so you can test:\nAPTANA - http://www.aptana.com/\nCODEBLOCKS - http://www.codeblocks.org/\nNew Version of C - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C1X\nNew Version of C++ - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B0x\n\nA: You may try the Ubuntu SDK.\nInstall it by typing this in terminal:\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-sdk\n\nFrom the Create Project window choose Non-Qt and Plain C++.\n\nA: You would start with an editor with syntax highlighting, like gedit, scite, emacs, vi or something else. \nYou would then learn to compile by hand, what an include-path is, what a library-path is, how to switch warnings on and off, how to build .o-files, libraries (.so), executables, and how to build makefiles. \nThen you would switch to an IDE, because now you would know what to configure to what values. It's harder if you don't know what, and don't know where. I don't use C++ anymore, so I only may say that from hearsay, Code::Blocks has some good reputation. \nWhether it is useful as a visual GUI-Builder I don't know - it isn't even clear from your question, whether you're looking for such a thing.\nAs Olcay pointed out in the comments, you need to install c++ tools (compiler, linker and so on) for c++ - maybe some dev-packages (development) too. \nsudo apt-get install g++\n\nIt's not a typo, it is g++ for gnu-c++. \n\nA: The two most popular IDEs (If you go by reviews on the software centre) are Code::Blocks and Geany. They aren't as feature packed as Visual Studio though.\nTo install them you can either search on the software centre for them or stick\nsudo apt-get install geany\n\n\nsudo apt-get install codeblocks\n\n\nin the terminal.\n\nA: Depending on what you want to do, you might want to use:\n\n\n*\n\n*For general-purpose, non-GUI-related C++ development, you can use Eclipse and the CDT plugin\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*If you want to write a C++ application with a GUI, you can use Qt Creator\n\n\nA: IDEs are pretty much a necessity with C++ because of their code completion and project management features. If however you want to stick with vim, the \"YouCompleteMe\" plugin is very effective and uses clang for it's backend. It also can be configured using an unobtrusive dot config file that you can check-in to your source tree and YCM will do the right thing when you're in that tree.\nNow if I could only get YCM working with the Linux kernel sources.\n", "Q: Creating a Fortunes file How can I create a fortunes file and add it to the fortune* command on the shell?\n*Fortune - \"console command to print a random, hopefully interesting, adage.\"\n\nA: This is explained in the manpages for fortune(6) and (especially) strfile(1).\nBasically, you create a text file that contains your \"fortune cookies\" separated by a line that contains a single % sign and nothing else.

I do development work on my computer and I want to have my webroot directory to be within my home directory so it is encrypted with the rest of my home directory. As I am the only use of the machine, I want to configure Apache to point to this directly.\nCurrent I have changed the /var/www folder into a symbolic link to the workspace in my hone dir: /home/valorin/workspace\nHowever, this throws 403 Forbidden errors in apache.\nI have added my user into the www-data group, and set the ownership & permissions on the workspace folder:\ndrwxrwxr-x  2 valorin www-data  4096 2011-04-23 10:02 workspace\n\nBut the only way I can get it to work is to change my home dir group to be www-data and set permissions too. I don't really want to do this as it means Apache has access to my home dir and could possibly be used by someone on my network to get into my personal data.\nDoes anyone know how I can solve this problem?\n\nA: You can leave your $HOME dir ownership alone. You don't need to set it to www-data. What you do have to do is ensure that Apache has execute permissions on $HOME and everything above it. So, you could do something like this:\nchmod 751 \"$HOME\"\nsudo chmod 751 /home\n\nHowever, the fact that $HOME is encrypted might pose major problems for Apache unless you can somehow configure Apache to use the proper decryption key.\nEDIT:\nSetting execute permissions on a directory means only that you can access something inside the directory if you already know its name and if what you're trying to access also has correct permissions. So setting a global x-bit on $HOME isn't too much of a security risk, as long as all your other files have reasonable permissions. You might want to look into your umask to be sure.\n", "Q: Runs ok in 10.10, screen flickers continuously like neon light in 11.04 I have an Alienware M17x R3 laptop with 460M nvidia card. I just got it brand new from Alienware today. Running nvidia driver doesn't work in 10.10 (GDM doesn't load at all), so I switch back to nouveau driver and upgrade to 11.04.\nOnce the upgrade finishes, when the computer boots up (after GRUB), the screen will continuously flickers like color-changing neon light.\nIs my computer not Ubuntu-compatible?\n\nA: I've been running 11.04 successfully on an nvidia-based Thinkpad for over 5 months, thru multiple configurations and driver options, so you should be able to get things working with relative ease -- barring any weirdness with the Alienware HW I'm not familiar with.\nBut first I'd suggest you get yourself to what I call a KGC (Known Good Configuration), as your question leaves out all the background stuff I/we need to know to TS effectively.\n\n\n*\n\n*Do a clean install of Natty 11.04. Accept all the defaults, except one. Wipe your current installation and reformat the drive. I'd suggest EXT4 as a filesystem. Reboot when complete.\n\n*Login to your clean install and first and foremost open terminal (or use the graphical update manager if you prefer) and type: \"sudo apt-get update\" (no quotes; let it do it's thing), then \"sudo apt-get upgrade\". When complete, reboot.\n\n*You should now be in one of two states: an accelerated driver has been installed (the unity panel is displayed on the left side of the screen); or, you're runnning in 2D mode (desktop looks like Maverick 10.10 with gnome panel on top of screen). If the former, you're golden; if the latter...\n\n*Do not simply click the driver update icon if it displays. This sometimes installs an older driver which may not be compatible with your newer system. Type  and enter \"additional drivers\". When the dialog displays, choose either the Nvidia (version current) [Recommended] option, or the Experimental 3D support option (nouveau). I've had excellent success with the nouveau driver on my 460-based system. Reboot when complete.\nIf anything doesn't work as above, write back and detail what you did, and where things fell apart.\n\nA: Log a bug. Natty is NOT ready and NOT stable. If you need your OS to work then use Lucid or Maverick. If you are happy to stomach feature oles and bugs and want to help get the OS ready for release by logging bugs to inform the devsof issues, then use Natty.\nNatty is in Beta....what did you expect??\n", "Q: How to hide Google Desktop icon on Gnome?

If you upgrade to 11.04 or 11.10, it is possible to blacklist the icon from the panel.\n", "Q: Is there anyway I can play a video on login I have this video clip that I want ubuntu to play when I login, is there a way of doing this?\n\nA: Add the command totem --fullscreen /path/to/video to your startup applications (or replace totem with your video player of choice).\n", "Q: Why isn't iTunes working for me? I know you are to install iTunes in WINE but when ever I open it an error message appears that says \nApple Application Support was not found.\nApple Application Support is required to run iTunes. Please uninstall\niTunes, then install iTunes again.\n\nError 2(Windows error 2)\n\nI have tried uninstalling the iTunes, re downloading it and repairing it.  Nothing seems to work.  Please help me here.  Thank you.\n\nA: I've also tried this, it didn't work for me. \niTunes was rated as Silver on the Winehq website, with few known reports of it working properly. http://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=application&iId=1347 \nI use banshee, it's simple, lightweight, and all around in my opinion, it's better than iTunes. It also allows you to Sync media to your iPod or iPhone, but with limited functionality. \nHope this helps. :) \n\nA: iTunes will not be fully usable with WINE, no matter how you try. Have you tried synchronising your iPod with Banshee, you may have far better luck that way.\n\nA: Try installing iTunes with PlayOnLinux.  It's a small program that automates the process of using wine to install Windows Applications.  Plus, it also searches \"dependencies\"(kind of, in your case, Apple Application Support) for Windows applications and installs it automatically.\nIf PlayOnLinux doesn't work, then you can try installing the Apple Application Support Standalone Package using wine and then install iTunes.  I extracted the file from the iTunes Installer. \n\nA: Some versions work with some versions of wine. If you'd chosen a product from a more open company then you would have significantly fewer issues. I suggest you check the wine appdb for your version of wine running the version of iTunes you have. You may need the wine ppa adding ad run wine 1.3\nAlternatively you could drop the ipod and get a decent device.\n", "Q: How can I adjust the brightness of my webcam?

The package is still available here, and it installs just fine as long as you have qt4 available from a third-party repo like the one in this answer. \n\nA: What worked for me (on Debian, probably also works with Ubuntu):\nsudo apt install xawtv\nv4lctl bright 100%\n\n\nA: I had a same issue in Ubuntu 18.04 and 20.04 and struggled a lot with this issue. Changing brightness is certainly the wrong answer.\nMy camera has its own logic which calculates the brightness according the light conditions (the proportion of the darkest and brightest part of the view).\nIn this case Guvcview is a good solution\n$ sudo apt install guvcview\n\nOn Cap.

If I do anything to cause occlusion on that part of the screen the background redraws and everything looks OK. Has anyone else experienced this problem?\n\n\nA: I've seen this on occasion, I think it's due to some driver problems.

I'm trying to complete a batch of 3 videos to leave it there till morning processing but it seems there are special characters in it... I try it \"raw\" in the terminal and it works but in bash script it stops working\nExample: \nargs1=\"-r 29.97 -t 00:13:30 -vsync 0 -vpre libx264-medium -i\"\nargs12=\"-r 29.97 -ss 00:40:30 -vsync 0 -vpre libx264-medium -i\"\nargs2=\"[in] scale=580:380 [T1],[T1] pad=720:530:0:50 (other arguments with lots of [ and ]\"\n\nIn the output it says \nUnable to find a suitable output format for 'scale=580:380' not sure why... like I said, the command runs fine in the command-line, just not in the script\n/usr/local/bin/ffmpeg \"$args1\" \"${file}\"  -vf \"$args2\" \"$args3\" \"${args[0]}_${startingfrom}_0001_02.mp4\"\n\n\nA: Don't put more than one argument in a variable, it will work for very simple cases, but otherwise give you nothing but grief. Use arrays instead. E.g.\ninfile=video.avi\noutfile=${infile%.*}.mp4  # video.mp4\nargs=(\n    -r 29.97 \n    -t 00:13:30 \n    -vsync 0 \n    -vpre libx264-medium \n    -vf \"[in] scale=580:380 [T1],[T1] pad=720:530:0:50\"\n)\n#...\nffmpeg -i \"$infile\" \"${args[@]}\" \"$outfile\"\n\n(The quotes are important)\nIn this case though, you might want a function instead. It's hard to say, since your question is a bit vague.\nSee BashFAQ 50\n\nA: In this case, where you want $argsN to be passed to ffmpeg as multiple arguments you actually don't want to quote it. To be clear, you do want to quote the line where you are setting it, so:\nargs1=\"-r 29.97 -t 00:13:30 -vsync 0 -vpre libx264-medium -i\" \n\nIs correct. But the ffmpeg line should look something like this:\n/usr/local/bin/ffmpeg $args1 \"${file}\"  -vf $args2 $args3 \"${args[0]}_${startingfrom}_0001_02.mp4\"\n\nThe problem here is that ffmpeg is expecting an array of arguments like this:\n0: /usr/local/bin/ffmpeg\n1: -r\n2: 29.97\n3: -t\n...\n\nWhen you quote the variable containing the arguments they are all sent in as a single argument like this:\n0: /usr/local/bin/ffmpeg\n1: -r 29.97 -t 00:13:30 -vsync 0 -vpre libx264-medium -i\n...\n\nSince ffmpeg has no single option, -r 29.97 -t 00:13:30 -vsync 0 -vpre libx264-medium -i it rightfully complains.\nIf you want to play around with being able to see how exactly your arguments are being passed you can use this simple shell script which prints each argument passed to it on a separate line:\n#!/bin/bash\necho \"0: $0\"\ni=1\nfor argument in \"$@\"; do\n    echo \"${i}: $argument\"\n    ((i++))\ndone\n\n\nA: Maybe you should try to define your args thus:\nargs2='[in] scale= .....'\n\n(note the single quote as opposed to the double quote).\nSay how you get on.\n\nA: It looks like $args1 and $args12 contain several options but $args2 looks like it should be a single value for the -vf option. So you should omit the quotes from $args1 and $args12 so they are subject to word splitting, but continue to quote $args2.\nHowever, the error message you report \"Unable to find a suitable output format for 'scale=580:380'\" looks like it is coming from ffmpeg and not the shell.\n", "Q: How do I run BleachBit from the terminal?

With luck it will work.\nNow note, I imagine this will also affect anything else that checks what version of Flash you are running so keep that in mind for whatever tests you are doing.\n\nA: I downloaded the .tar.gz package from the Adobe website and copied libflashplayer.so in /usr/lib/mozilla/plugins to solve this issue.\n\nA: I started having this problem with Ubuntu 11.10.\nI read every single reply here but none worked. Eventually I browsed /opt/google/chrome/plugins and found three outdated files there. The three outdated files were:\n\nlibflashplayer.so   Nov 2 2010\nlibflashplayer.so.64bit   Jul 23 2009\nlibflashplayer.so.org   Nov 14 2008\n\nI created a folder called:\n/opt/google/chrome/plugins/backup and move all three files there.\nI then went to http://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/ and downloaded the .tar.gz for other Linux.\nI extracted the file libflashplayer.so to /opt/google/chrome/plugins and finally after months of frustration the problem is sorted out.\n", "Q: Is there a program like Microsoft Paint? Greetings, I'm slowly getting used to Ubuntu; for I've been a Windows user as long as I've used any computer. I'm hoping someone can suggest a good graphics software.  \nI'm simply looking for one that works close to Microsoft Paint.\nDoes Ubuntu offer anything like it?\n\nA: Look at shutter, the feature rich screenshot tool. In Microsoft App terms, it is actually a combination of the snipping tool and ms paint.\nIt captures screenshots, but it also has an edit mode for the screenshots (or some file you can load from your hard drive) with some basic drawing tools, which are well thought-out and quite usable for inserting arrows and numbers into images, cropping, etc. Things you do to images to cut +paste them into presentations, after editing.\nUpdate 2021: These days, I would install Shutter from Snapcraft\n\nA: For a basic MS Paint clone I would also suggest xpaint and kolourpaint. Both are available on the Software Centre.\nxpaint:\n\nkolourpaint:\n\n\nA: There is also Gnome Paint.\n\n\n\nA: It isn't Paint exactly but I really like Inkscape.  It is a vector graphics editor.\nMaybe that is more than you want.\nhttp://sourceforge.net/projects/inkscape/\nIts also in the repository\n\nA: The closest MS Paint clone is Pinta.  I regard it as vastly superior to MS Paint, but it retains its simplicity.\n\n\nEdit\nOn latest Ubuntu, you have to update permissions to avoid crash.\n\n*\n\n*Launch permission window from Software.\n\n*Enable the last permission\n\"Read/Write files on removable storage devices.\"\n\n\nA: mtPaint is a lightweight equivalent of Microsoft Paint. It is lighter (requires only 1 MB to install because it depends on GTK which Ubuntu has out-of-the-box) than Pinta, which needs 20 MB disc space on a standard Ubuntu install because of the Mono dependency.\nmtPaint is documented, unlike Pinta: mtPaint handbook\n\nA: Ubuntu has gimp in the repository. It is far more powerful than paint, but you needn't use all functions. You just need an good introduction.\nAt Meet the Gimp there are many, many comfortable video-tutorials. It isn't easy to not get lost in the big number of options with gimp, but sooner or later you need more, than some simple program is offering. So it might be more easy to learn one program in depth, than first an easy one, and then the more complicated one too. \n", "Q: Wacom Bamboo Pen & Touch not working after installing doctormo's PPA Yesterday I installed doctormo's PPA package of the Wacom drivers to get a new Wacom Bamboo Pen & Touch working on my Ubuntu 10.04 LTS laptop, as instructed here and dozens of other web pages.

There is no way that your wacom will work if the usb device isn't plugged in and detected by the kernel.\nCheck any usb hub, check everything over. Your wacom will have to appear in the lsusb in order for the wacom driver to kick in. Also check your dmesg log to see if it's being junked by some weird kernel error. More logs will be needed to confirm what's going wrong.\n\nA: Turned out that it was due to a missing /usr/lib/X11/xorg.conf.d/10-wacom.conf, which was removed in a packaging screw-up in an update from just a few days ago. After adding in the one from http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1515562 everything worked again. Thanks go to Favux.\n\nA: Are you using a powered USB port? Wacom tablets require a powered port. Not all laptop USB ports are powered. On mine it is a separate port from a main group of USB connections. Try other ports.\n", "Q: Wine or virtual machine (VirtualBox) to run apps (eg. Photoshop) I am wondering if it will be better (stability, convenience and speed) to run apps like Photoshop with Wine or a virtual machine like VirtualBox?\n\nA: Just to answer your question about running programs like Photoshop on WINE. I run the latest Photoshop using WINE. Even the 3d acceleration works. However, to run a recent copy of illustrator, I have to use a Virtual machine. WINE cant run it.\nOne major problem with this is that copy/paste doesnt work between the graphic apps, Wether on WINE or VM.\nOther than that, my simple rule is this:\nRun on WINE first. If the functionality is really taking a beating, then use a VM. There's has been absolutely no cases for me where a program that runs fine in WINE runs faster on a VM. Its normally more snappier via WINE.\n\nA: Compatible Wine applications can be found here.\nWine based applications are often said to have an equivalent speed as running on Native Windows.  I have seen reports that claim Wine based applications run faster.\nThe database presents a colour coding describing the stability and issues found when running the Windows application under Wine.\nPlatinum rated applications will work without any issues for a particular version of Wine.  The keypart of that statement is the version of Wine.  It comes in two flavours:\n\n\n*\n\n*Wine 1.2 from the repository is the recommended stable version of Wine.\n\n*Wine 1.3 (also from the repository) is the current development version of Wine.  It will be updated every two weeks with fixes - and regressions.\nThus, if the winehq.org database says that it is Gold/Platinum rated under a version 1.3.x then the application will run close to the native Windows speed, but with the understanding that the stability could be affected with the next development update.\nIf you want rock-solid stability then stay with either a dual-boot Ubuntu/Windows installation, or you can use a good virtual solution such as VirtualBox or VMWare.  This will give you the same stability but with the speed sacrifice of running a virtual solution - this can be anything between 5 to 30% (or more) depending upon the type of Windows application and the type of virtual hosting solution.\nGraphics intensive based applications tend to suffer more under a virtual solution due to the reliance on virtual graphics driver - this driver tends to give basic graphics performance for 2D based applications.  Hence, games rarely run well under a virtual solution.  Recent VirtualBox versions claim to have good 3D capabilities with newer Graphics cards.\nSince Photoshop is graphically intensive, you perhaps should consider running this virtually only if you have a very good graphics card - you should also consider installing any proprietary driver such as NVIDIA or ATI Catalyst.\n", "Q: Removing a package broke gnome-panel, how do I get it back? i have ubuntu 10.10 and i remove nspr4 package from synaptic (wrong!).\nAfter that gnome-panel is disabled and i lost internet connection. i install libnspr-dev and libnsrp. But there are no gnome-panel. Do i need install gnome-panel?\n\nA: You didn't say exactly which package you removed, but the only similar package installed on my machine is libnspr4-0d. It is a dependency of a bunch of stuff, so if you removed it, you'll have to reinstall a lot of things. gnome-panel is one such thing you'll have to reinstall.\nI recommend, however, that you also reinstall ubuntu-desktop to hopefully get everything back. In the future, you shouldn't remove anything beginning with lib unless you know what you're doing or your package manager informs you that the lib is no longer needed.\nBy the way, you only need *-dev packages (such as libnspr4-dev) if you want to compile software from source that has a build-time dependency on that particular library.\n\nA: To identify what you've installed/deinstalled take a look in /var/log/apt/history.log.\n", "Q: What to use to annotate PDF (Highlight/Underline) \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow can I highlight PDFs? \n\nIn windows, I can use Foxit but on Ubuntu x64, what can I use?

However, they are recorded in a special format (not video), but the resulting files are smaller, and as such easily transferable.\nI use playterm.org as a hosting for my ttyrec files. It allows you to view your terminal recordings over a browser (as if it were a video).\nSteps\nRecording\nsudo apt-get install ttyrec\nttyrec\n#Type your commands\ngit init #Example command\nexit\n\nA ttyrec session is similar to a screen session, except that it is recorded. After your recording is complete, a file with .tty extension will be present in your directory. You can upload that file to playterm, or pass people a download link.\nPlaying\nTo play the file, they'd need to use the ttyplay command. Just use ttyplay file.tty and it should play your terminal.\nEditing\nSince you are comfortable with adding audio later, I'd recommend copying the ttyrec file to a normal ubuntu desktop, and playing the recording (using ttyplay) while recording it using a screencasting session. You can record your voiceovers at the same time.\nReferences:\n\n*\n\n*ttyrec Home Page\n\n*ttyrec man page\n\nA: asciinema.org (earlier ascii.io)\n\nasciinema [as-kee-nuh-muh] is a free and open source solution for recording terminal sessions and sharing them on the web.\nIt is fully open-source platform with aim of being a \"go to\" place for terminal users wanting to share their hackery.

It is there in the repository. It will give you the detaiiled hardware indformation about your system. If you are using the old gnome-panels then there is also the \" cpu frequency monitoring applet\" which will show your current cpu status.\n\nA: Try i7z if you are using an Intel i3, i5, or i7 CPU.  It shows the actual current CPU frequency, even if you have overclocked it using the BIOS. To see the overclocked speed you'll have to run a job that pushes at least one core, or you'll only see a much lower idle frequency in i7z. \n(This answer is almost identical to an answer I gave in CPU Frequency is off , but it seems you're interested in the same thing.  Please let me know if this isn't the right way to answer 2 similar questions.)\n\nA: The file /proc/cpuinfo contains information about the cpu(s) on your system.

I would like to pre-install Ubuntu on a computer for someone. I may want to customize it for them, but in the end they need to be able to choose a username, password, etc. when they first boot it up. (Also called an OEM install).\nHow do I do this?\n\nA: Use the built-in OEM install functionality!\nIt's very easy to install Ubuntu on a computer for someone else, so that you can customize it for their needs but they can still perform the final basic setup (username, password, language, etc.).\nPhase 1. Pre-installation\n1 (Updated for Ubuntu 20.04 UEFI).\nMake sure to  boot from the installation USB in the UEFI mode. You will see the screen below. If you don't see this grub menu, then you did not boot in the UEFI mode from the USB.\nSelect OEM install (for Manufacturer) as shown below:\n\n\n*\n\n*(For BIOS/Legacy/CSM installs (untested in Ubuntu 20.04)) Press any key to interrupt the LiveCD/LiveUSB autoboot; then press F4 and select OEM Install, and then \"Install Ubuntu\"\n\n\nThe rest of the process is pretty much the same as below.\n\n\n*Enter a \"company name\" (it will only be used in error reports, etc.)\n\n\n\n\n*Continue installing...\n\n\n\n\n*Enter a temporary username, password and machine-name for the customization phase\n\n\n\n*Restart\n\n\n###Phase 2.

Pardon my ignorance, but I'm relatively new to Linux and unable to find a sufficient answer to this question elsewhere.  I'm looking to install the Linux Mint environment on top of Ubuntu, preferably with the option of switching between the normal Ubuntu Gnome environment and Mint (like you would switch between Gnome and KDE).\nTwo questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is this even possible?\n\n*If so, what's the easiest way to go about this?\n\n\nThanks in advance!\n\nUpdate:\nTurns out when I asked this question I didn't know how to ask it correctly. What I wanted was not all of Linux Mint but rather just the Cinnamon desktop environment.\nThe Cinnamon desktop environment used in Linux Mint can be installed with Ubuntu using the following command:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:gwendal-lebihan-dev/cinnamon-stable && sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install cinnamon nemo\n\nHopefully this helps anyone who comes to this question looking for how to install the Mint desktop environment on top of Ubuntu.\n\nA: Because Linux Mint isn't related to Ubuntu the way Kubuntu and the like are, (Direct offshoots etc...) you unfortunately cannot install the Linux Mint environment on top of the Ubuntu DE like you can with say, Kubuntu/Xubuntu/Lubuntu etc...You can do a second partition and install Linux Mint on that and subsequently choose between them at system boot with the GRUB menu but that's the extent of what you can do in regards to running Linux Mint on Ubuntu...\n\nA: It's not possible to switch like Gnome and KDE. You need to make a fresh install for Linux Mint and in the end of the installation, grub (boot loader) will do the things in spite of you.\nYou can select the Operating Systems after the BIOS section on Grub window.\n\nA: As the others have said, you can't do it like that. However, you can modify your Ubuntu to ACT like Linux Mint. To get the Mint Menu, and other Mint tools, add the WebUpd8 PPAs for each one. it's a slog, but you probably don't need all of them\n", "Q: Boot into recovery console I found out that since my brand new Alienware M17xR3 laptop is running Intel Sandy Bridge, I have two options to get it to work:\n\n\n*\n\n*Run 11.04 which has experimental Sandy Bridge support in the kernel\n\n*Disable nVidia Optimus if I want to use nvidia driver\n\n\nOption 2 is not possible because there is no option in the BIOS even though I have already updated to the latest version from Dell's support site.\nThus, it comes to my question: my attempt to install 11.04 works until I have to reboot.

When I type in custom trackers into the tracker list, and try to save the list I get a message saying:\nList contains invalid URLs\nAm I doing something wrong?\n\nA: Probably because it includes udp trackers, which aren't supported in Transmission until version 2.30.\n\nA: This was the first link hat I found on google... after trying about a dozen from a list i found online I realized why I was getting this message. Windows uses a carriage return and newline to denote an end of line, where unix only uses a newline. I opened the file in my IDE (geany) and converted the line endings and it worked for the entire list.\nHope this helps.\n\nA: For whatever reason, trackers (in my case) had to be added one by one. Adding them all at once would cause that error message.\n\nA: In my case it was solved by using udp trackers and leaving a blank line after each link.\n\nA: Issue may be because of certain characters in the list. Open sublime text and copy the list you want to add.\nThen use Ctrl+H and replace \\s\\s (assuming lines are separated by one empty line) with \\n (use Regular Expession option) and try pasting.

If you are still unsure about whether Unity will work for you then here is another route you might take.\nDownload the iso file from the Ubuntu web site for 12.04 Desktop. From there you need to use the downloaded .iso file together with a program such as 'Brasero' or 'GNOME Baker' to burn an 'image' to a disk (on Windows use Nero).\nOnce you have made the disk then put it into your computer's DVD drive as the computer is booting and it should boot off the disk. Don't worry, this will not cause any problems with your computer. Eventually, you'll be given the choice, on the screen, of installing Ubuntu or just trying it. Choose 'Try Ubuntu'. This will not do anything to your hard disk. You will be able to see if you can run Unity on your computer. You can try looking for 'Additional Drivers' in th emenu system and see what it says about your computer.\nIf you are happy that it works then remove the disk and close down. Then boot as normal and  back-up all your important files from your hard disk. Then you can install the latest version of Ubuntu, should you wish, from the disk. 12.04 is supported for 5 years. Remember that Ubuntu 11.xx are not long term support so you'll have to upgrade somehow eventually.\nIf you find that your computer doesn't work the way you wish with Ubuntu 12.04 you could try installing Xubuntu 12.04 which is a lighter desktop. That has a nice panel at the bottom of the screen. If you prefer something else, to the panel, then you can install the 'Avant Windows Navigator', Cairo Dock, 'GNOME Do' or other docks which are alternatives to Unity.\nHope this helps!\n", "Q: Why is a restart only required on some updates? Why doesn't Ubuntu require restarts on more updates? I know that for kernel updates and things like video drivers, it can't load the changes without a restart. But I'm curious about more basic updates of pretty fundamental packages that often don't require restarts. Things like Telepathy, glibc, gtk, etc. Why don't packages like this require a restart to be updated? Is the new version actually running right after an update?\nAnother example would be Gwibber. I recently received and update to gwibber via the Update Manager while gwibber was running. The update completed successfully. Would gwibber be running the new version without manually restarting it? And is that the same for other packages? (I know some like mysql and apache automatically restart on an update). For packages that don't automatically restart, can't that be somewhat of a security issue for security fix?\nThis comes up because I have been running OS X for about a week and almost every update requires a restart even if it isn't kernel/video driver related (as far as I can tell - they don't give you a lot of information). A friend of mine said that Apple forces restarts on most updates \"just in case\" it would be weird if you didn't restart. Windows is the worst because almost any install/uninstall or update requires a restart (often forcing shutdowns to take a very long time). This may be a bit broad for this venue, but why do the different operating systems handle this so differently? Or, more specific to Ubuntu: why doesn't Ubuntu follow a more strict restart policy?\n\nA: Whenever you open or execute a file in Windows, Windows locks the file in place (this is a simplification, but usually true.) You may have encountered those annoying errors where you can't delete a file because another process has an exclusive lock on it. This is why whenever Windows has to update itself you need a reboot for it to take effect. Windows will queue up file replacement and deletion activities for when it next boots up (when nothing has a lock on anything.)\nOn the other hand, Linux has a mechanism wherein it's not the file that is locked but the underlying data on the disk that is. This may seem a trivial differentiation but it means that the file's record in the filesystem's table of contents can be deleted without disturbing any program that already has the file open. So you can delete a file while it is still executing or otherwise in use and it will continue to exist on disk as long as some process has an open handle for it even though its entry in the file table is gone. This allows Linux to replace a program completely while it's still running and then simply restart the program or just wait for the process to exit naturally. Once the old instance is killed, the old files will no longer exist at all and the new files will have taken up residence in their entries in the file table.\nSo, as long as a particular file is not special in some way (like, for example, the kernel image file or files belonging similarly low-level systems) the updater can usually update-in-place like this. I'm sure there are special cases and situations where this would not be a good idea, but for most cases it's fine.\nAs for why OS X does it, that \"just in case\" theory sounds plausible.\n", "Q: How do I launch the \"SMB Browser\" and point it to a Windows Print share? I need to know if launching Ubuntu's \"SMB Browser\" program (pictured below) and pointing it at a Windows print server is possible.\n\nI tried using ps aux to get an idea of what program is being used behind the scenes, but I couldn't find it, although I think its probably the GNOME CUPS print configuration app, since you can get to it from System -> Administration -> Printing. \nI'm preparing a laptop image where users will need to be able to select a shortcut that takes them to the Windows print server and lets them select a printer in a (relatively) user-friendly way like Windows does.\nI'd like to know if that is possible with SMB Browser. Failing that, I'd like to know if there are any alternatives.\n\nA: I'm sorry to say that I don't think that is possible..

Can anyone say me how to set a VNC password in Ubuntu? Such that if anyone access my machine through VNC it should prompt for a password.\n\nA: You can set a password when you open Remote Desktop.\n\nOr withvncpasswd you can also set the password for the vnc-server.\nSo if someone want to connect to you, he has to enter the password.\n\nA: In my case, I forgot the password to the VNC server.  For my situation, the final target was TightVNC running on Ubuntu 18.04 which I needed to reach from my mac.\nYou first kill the existing VNC sessions with \nvncserver -kill :1\n\nUse something like this to find out if you've killed all sessions.  Usually, the vncserver is running on port 5901:\nsudo netstat -peanut | grep \"vncserver\"\n\nIf there is something, repeat the kill command with the appropriate vncserver -kill :2 or whatever listing.  If nothing, then you can remove the default original password setting with:\nsudo rm ~/.vnc/passwd\n\nRestart the vncserver as:\nvncserver\n\nAnd you'll be prompted again for a new password.  The daemon should run on port 5901, which you can query with the netstat command above.\n", "Q: How to transfer a file from one system to another system in a single command? How to transfer a file from one system to another system easily?In my company employees will always ask us to transfer files from one system A to  system B and so on. What we do is first we access system A through samba and copy the required files and then we access the system B through samba and paste the files there.Is there any easy and quick way of transferring of files from one system to another system?Any GUI will be preferable, thanks in advance :)\n\nA: You can use ssh to transfer files.\nSo you can transfer a file like this: \nscp /home/user/examplefile otheruser@192.168.1.101:/home/otheruser/\n\nThis will transfer examplefile to /home/otheruser\nIf you dont like to use commands, you can just use nautilus, which supports the ssh-protocol. The remote location appears just like a normal directory and you can copy files there.\nTo access the remote location, open Nautilus and look under File > Connect to Server... then choose the location you want.\n\nA: The easy way of doing this that we did in a company I used to work in was that there was a network shared folder that everyone could use on a temporary basis. That way you don't need to copy files for people, they can just put their files on the central shared directory and then they can access it from any of the other machines on the floor.\nIf there are security concerns then you might have to give everyone their own passworded folder on shared directory, which involves a little more back work on your part but will save you a lot of work in the long term.\nIf people have to ask you to move files around they might as well use a USB stick, much better to let them do it themselves on the network.\n", "Q: How to - View sound percentage? Is there a way to make Ubuntu show me the current main volume level in the form of a percent? Like Windows 7 does when you change the sound level.\nI'm just sorta a number freak, and I like to know what percentage my volume is at. Thanks :)\n\nA: In a terminal you can use amixer to ask for the volume. For example my Master volume:\nuser@srv % amixer get Master\nSimple mixer control 'Master',0\n  Capabilities: pvolume pvolume-joined pswitch pswitch-joined penum\n  Playback channels: Mono\n  Limits: Playback 0 - 31\n  Mono: Playback 21 [68%] [-15.00dB] [on]\n\nTo get a visual feedback use notify-send (from libnotify-bin):\nuser@srv % notify-send \"volume\" \"$(amixer get Master | grep dB | sed 's/\\(^[a-z0-9 :]\\+\\[\\|\\[\\|\\]\\)//gi')\"\n\n\nA: If you hover your mouse over the volume icon in the panel, the percent should show in a tooltip. I don't think the built-in Gnome applet has a feature like the one you describe.\n\nA: Pulse audio control \"pavcontrol\" from the software centre displays percentage.\n", "Q: Banshee crashes at startup Whenever I launch banshee, it loads the window and I can see it for 1-2 seconds before crashing without displaying any errors.

So, I bought a NAS, which I configured successfully in /etc/fstab, on mu Kubuntu 10.10 Thinkpad x40. It works just fine when I am at home. A few days I went out with my laptop and the problem is, that when not at home, both suspend and hibernate functions seem forever to work. \nI commented out the entry on fstab and the laptop started to work as expected.\nI played with autofs, but it seems just dies at one moment and I cannot access anything. It works for some time, and then just goes off.\nIs there any consistent way, to make my laptop access the drive when at home and work OK when away?\nProbably a script that runs at startup, checks if the mount is there and mounts it if available... or a script that umount the drive at suspend|hibernate and loads it back at startup.\nAny useful ideas?\n\nA: I consider the best way to mount NAS to a laptop which is on the go, in Ubuntu, to mount it via gvfs. The only downside is that KDE based programs, if you use any, might fire warnings if you copy files to the NAS with them. I hope this helps somone.\nAnother useful way to do this is use wicd - it allows scripts to be executed at specific wifi post-connect or pre-disconnect(the disconnect should be triggered bu the system - shutdown, suspend, disconnect, hibernate). Thus, a useful script could be written which mounts or umounts the NAS when connecting or disconnecting from the home wifi. Wicd is so buggy under unity2D, so it is almost unusable    \n\nA: Would you try this:\n(Instead of using fstab to mount, we will use a script that will run at startup). \n1) Test to see if this work:  \nsudo mount -t cifs -o username=*,password=*,uid=1000,gid=1000,noperm,_netdev,iocharset=utf8,file_mode=0777,dir_mode=0777­,vers$ //192.168.1.106/Public /media/MyBookLive   \n\n2) When you get an acceptable working mount command, then\nEdit the file /etc/rc.local (gksu gedit /etc/rc.local) to look like this:  \n\n#!/bin/sh -e\n#\n# rc.local\n#\n# This script is executed at the end of each multiuser runlevel.\n# Make sure that the script will \"exit 0\" on success or any other\n# value on error.\n#\n# In order to enable or disable this script just change the execution\n# bits.\n#\n# By default this script does nothing \n# but desgua has changed it \n# to mount a samba folder\nmount -t cifs -o username=*,password=*,uid=1000,gid=1000,noperm,_netdev,iocharset=utf8,file_mode=0777,dir_mode=0777­,vers$ //192.168.1.106/Public /media/MyBookLive \nexit0\n\n3) Test to see if you can hibernate with the NAS turned off without delays.  \n\nOther useful information: \nTo check if the NAS is mounted you can use:\nmountpoint /mnt/your_mount_folder_name \nTo unmount:\nsudo umount /mnt/your_mount_folder_name \nor, if you get errors with the above, you can use:\nsudo umount -l /mnt/your_mount_folder_name \nYou can combine both so it will only try to unmount if it is mounted:\nmountpoint /mnt/your_mount_folder_name && sudo umount -l /mnt/your_mount_folder_name\nYou can mount manually so you don't get trouble with fstab:\nsudo mount -t cifs uid=1000,gid=1000 //192.168.0.xxx/your_NAS_folder_name /mnt/your_folder_name \n", "Q: Blurry vertical sections using fglrx with Radeon hd 6970 So I managed to get fglrx working by downloading the drivers from ATI because the ones from additional drivers boot to a black screen and the open source dont let me change resolution. My one issue is that half of my monitor is fine and the other half is blurry almost as if there's a blurry vertical stripe on the right side. I tried disabling Compiz and have the same issue in both gnome and kde, I was wondering if theres an xorg.conf change that could be made to fix this as I have already set the resolution and refresh rates to the correct values.\n\nA: This problem went away with the latest version of Ubuntu.\nThe version that was used previously was 10.10 and I can probably safely say the problem occurs in older versions as the version of ATI's driver that supports the HD 69xx series were incompatible with 10.10 and below although installing the driver from the ATI website works (albeit with the vertical lines) because the driver from Additional Drivers causes you to drop to a shell or panic because fglrx crashes upon startup.\n", "Q: Do not start bluetooth automaticaly. How to do that? \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow can I deactivate Bluetooth on system startup? \n\nI want that my bluetooth by defautl be turned off. How can I do that?

I just noticed that no new \"Weekly\" newsletter has been released since January, and I can't seem to find any information on why the newsletter has been put on hold for this long.\nDoes anyone know more?\n\nA: Thank you for asking this question and I want to apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused you or other readers.\nI’m the Ubuntu News Team Leader and Chief Editor of the Ubuntu Weekly Newsletter.\nHowever, as of the end of last October I had to take a less active roll in the producing UWN due to a house fire and all the fall out that comes with that.  Other team members--Elizabeth Krumbach (pleia2) and Nathan Handler (nhandler)--have worked hard to field questions and produce UWN in my absence, but it’s a lot of work as pleia2 even wrote about on her blog.\nPrior to October though,  the team has needed more volunteers to accomplish covering the scope of the Ubuntu Community.  Many people want to help without realizing the time, energy, and effort that goes into making the publication work.\nIn the last year, we have moved the team into a public IRC channel on irc.freenode.net --#ubuntu-news-- so that we, the Ubuntu News Team,  would be working in the open and allow for more “drive-by” contributors with the understanding that not every suggestion will make it into UWN, but stressing that each suggestion is appreciated and wanted.\nWe asked readers to answer a short survey so the format could be updated based on reader preference.  We’ve looked at new ways to offer the news letter in addition to the wiki page and plain text email. \nIf the process stays the same then it takes upwards of 16+ hours to put the newsletter together and publish it.  It is not an automated process nor should it be.  It takes someone and or many people to make sure we link to the original stories, that the summaries capture the spirit and meaning of an article in 3 to 4 sentences.\nWe check spelling, grammar, format, links and more, but we won’t change the authors original writing.\nIn short, there hasn’t been a newsletter because there hasn’t been people willing to help.  Asking the same 3 or 4 people to give up weekends for years is not acceptable either and that’s what was happening and because of that we are looking at ways to keep burn out from happening going forward.\nThe good news in all of this is a re-launch is being planned and will take place after UDS-O. However, more contributors are needed for every detail of the newsletter and without that UWN will not be a predictable and consistent publication. \nAnyone wishing to help with UWN please can contact me or the news team and we can get UWN polished, perfected and reflecting the pulse of the community one week at a time again!\n", "Q: How to check if a user is logged in? how do i check from within a php script, if a user is logged in? My current way is, to get the output of \nw | grep <username>\n\nand check, if there is output. It works, if a user is logged in via gdm, kdm or ssh or login on a tty. But what it doesn't get is, if an other user opened a terminal and run su <username>, this shell process is not reported, how do i get this?\n\nA: Well, if userA uses su to become userB, then userB is still not logged in.\nHowever, how about this:\nps -u <username>\n\nThen you can check $? -eq 0 to see if any processes were found belonging to that user. However, if there are any long-running processes owned by that user, then it will still show them. If that's no good, you could check for their shell.\n", "Q: \"Desktop effects could not be enabled\" in VMware I am running on a Windows 7 64 bit host.\nI'm use with VMware Player.\nUbuntu 10.10.\nAnd, i get to Visual Effect, and when i press \"normal\" i get this error:\n\nDesktop effects could not be enabled\n\nand if i press: compiz:\n\ncompiz (core) - Fatal: Software\n  rendering detected. compiz (core) -\n  Error: Failed to manage screen: 0\n  compiz (core) - Fatal: No manageable\n  screens found on display :0.0\n\nWhat i can to do?\n\nA: Vmware player doesn't support OpenGL on Linux yet, according to How to enable 3D in VMware Player?

In maverick, and I belive many old ubuntus, one could zoom in and out by holding super and scrolling with the mouse, but that doesn't work in Natty. How do you activate that again?\n\nA: First of all you need to install CompizConfig Settings Manager from the Software Centre. Once you've done that then launch it, and find the Enhanced Zoom Desktop plugin.\nHere you need to enable the Zoom In and Zoom Out mouse shortcuts. To get the same behaviour as in 10.10 then set Zoom In to Button4 and Zoom Out to Button5.\nBe aware that the Unity panel and launcher are not zoomable (this is probably why this functionality was disabled by default).

So is there any alternative Store (other than Jamendo and Magnatune, I'm looking for something more \"mainstream\") that works on Ubuntu for non-US users (eg: Amazon MP3 is not an option, since it's US only)?\nI would love to be able to actually buy my music rather than illegally downloading it from the internet, but so far I failed to find a real alternative. Buying CDs in online stores and having them shipped to me isn't an alternative for me either. And options that require wine/crossover are out of question too.\nSo, how can I get my favorite music legally on Ubuntu?\n\nA: Amazon MP3 has a Swiss website at amazonmp3.ch.\nBanshee has great integration with Amazon MP3. Like the Ubuntu One store, then purchased music goes directly into your library. \nsudo apt-get install banshee\n\nYou may need to first enable the Amazon plugin under\nEdit -> Preferences -> Extensions.\nYou can then change the plugins settings to use the Swiss store under\nEdit -> Preferences -> Source Specific -> Amazon MP3 Store.\n\n\nA: Amazon UK may not integrate directly with Ubuntu's music programs, but you can certainly still buy from their web page :\nhttp://www.amazon.co.uk/MP3-Music-Download/b/ref=sa_menu_dm1?ie=UTF8&node=77197031\nWhat little online music I buy, I do it on my Android phone, which then uses Dropbox to sync the data to my PC.  I prefer to buy my music on CD's however, so that I can rip them to FLAC for better quality.  Ubuntu has many useful tools for this purpose - the two I use are \"Audio CD Extractor\" and \"Sound Converter\".\n\nA: Try the 7digital online store, which is what backs the Ubuntu One Music store but which is available in most regions.  It includes a huge number of artists, including a lot of mainstream ones.  \nTheir online store allows you to download your purchased music as DRM-free mp3s, though I'm not aware of any way to integrate that directly into either Banshee or Rhythmbox.  \n", "Q: How to make Adobe Air audio work? Does anyone have any idea on how to make Air Adobe work on a 64-bit Ubuntu?  If I try to install the .bin version from the Adobe site, the application using Adobe Air works fine but there's no sound!\nThank you.\n\nA: Here it talks about installing Adobe Air (a 32-bit application) on Ubuntu 64-bit,\nhttp://kb2.adobe.com/cps/521/cpsid_52132.html\nIf sound does not work, then most probably a dependency (probably an application library related to sound) has not been installed. \nYou would use ldd and the name of the Adobe Air executable to see what libraries are missing.\nHowever, the proper way to deal with this issue would be to ask for help at Adobe at the article \nhttp://kb2.adobe.com/cps/521/cpsid_52132.html \n\nA: The problem is that you don't have the 32-bit asound libraries installed. From the command line, simply do this:\nsudo apt-get install libasound2-plugins:i386\n\nAfter that, your AIR applications will be able to play sounds.\n", "Q: Apt-mirror monitoring how to?

Whenever (using flash) I make YouTube videos fullscreen then they come out not actually any bigger. \nIn the screenshot below you see exactly what I see when watching a video in fullscreen mode. All the black space shouldn't be there (I think). I don't see this problem in other sites, for example BBC iPlayer.\n\nIs this standard YouTube behaviour, common on YouTube, or is it just me?\nAny suggestions on fixing it?\n\nA: I have developed a workaround for this problem. It happens because Flash incorrectly determines the screen size when using multimonitor, so I coded a LD_PRELOAD hack that feeds Flash a different value when it asks for screen size. You can get it from my webpage:\nWorkaround for Flash on Linux Multihead Desktops | Al's Website\nIt's a bit tricky to install (you have to enter your screen size in the code and compile it yourself) but it does work.\n\nA: I think the best solution is using the MaximizeFlash plugin for Chrome. It detects any flash in the page and you can make them fullscreen. To get rid of toolbar up just hit f11. You don't need to install any other apps. \nFor Firefox there is a similar plugin.\n\nA: Okay, this is one of those embarassing occasions when you discover what's going on just after posting a question...\nIt is because of my dual monitor setup. YouTube is seeing the size of both monitors together, but then shrinks it to fit on one for some reason.\nIt doesn't happen on videos that are available in HD (in fact if the video is available in HD even if you watch it at 480p or lower resolutions then it works, which is a bit strange).\nIt seems this issue has been around for several years and the easiest fix is to enable HTML5 mode in YouTube.\n\nA: The problem is flashplayer identifies your full screen as both monitors, and then scales it down to only one monitor so the video looks longer but smaller.\nThis drove me mad for months until I found this workaround found here:\nhttp://al.robotfuzz.com/content/workaround-fullscreen-flash-linux-multiheaded-desktops\nIs basically a little script than \"lies\" to the browser modifying the environmental variables to make firefox think your fullscreen resolution is 1024x768 and not 2048x768 in my case (you can configure other resolutions) and use only one of both monitors. You need to install nspluginwrapper first (is in the repos).\nInside the .tar.gz you'll find the script and instructions to configure it. Also, instead of calling firefox with the parameters every time, you can make a little script like this I use and save it in your personal scripts directory (for instance $HOME/.scripts/firefox\n#!/bin/bash\nLD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/nspluginwrapper/i386/linux/libfullscreenhack.so /usr/bin/firefox \"$@\"\n\nIf you want to use the same with another browser like chrome or chromium you'll only need to do a similar script for them.\nGood luck.\n\nA: I've have similar problems with a lot of apps like wine games etc. where the app is unable to detect the per-screen resolution and instead detects the total resolution as one screen.\nThe permanent solution i found was to run nvidia-settings , disable xinerama and configure \"Seperate X Screen\" . I now have two seperate displays , the usual DISPLAY=:0 and :0.1  . Since the X apps in both screen now run in thier own seperate sessions , with thier own desktop etc. , all apps detect the resolution for each monitor perfectly , and changing resolution in one screen does not affect another.\nThe only downside is i am unable to drag windows from one screen to another and need to launch apps in different screens as required. However this works perfectly for me since i keep browser in one display and the kids can play their emulator or see TV / movies on the other monitor without affecting my work.\n\nA: Very easy workaround in Chromium / Chrome with Dual monitor set:\n\n\n*\n\n*Right click on the youtube video\n\n*Select \"Pop out\"\n\n*Now you have the video in a new window\n\n*Move it to your second monitor\n\n*Maximize the window\n\n*Now you see the bar at the top \n\n*For Video Controls, right click on video and select \"Show Controls\"\n\n*Click on Full Screen Icon in the Video Controls\nOR   Right click on the bar, select \"Use System Title bar and Borders\"\n\n*The bar at the top disappeared\n\n\nA: I have the same issue, having two different-resolution monitors connected to my PC.\nMy workaround is simple. Just zoom in in firefox until the video about fills the width of the screen. This also resolves another annoyance: if a video is playing fullscreen on one monitor, clicking on a window on the other monitor kicks the video out of fullscreen.\n\nA: My workaround for this uses the data URL in Chrome to open an embedded video at the full screen resolution, then I put chrome in full screen mode. Try with:\ndata:text/html,<body style=\"background-color:black;\">\n<iframe width=\"1900\" height=\"1060\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/VIDEO_CODE_HERE\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nJust put the video code in and change the width and height to your screen resolution. Then put it in your address bar.\n", "Q: UDF DVD mount issues in Maverick When I insert the DVD into my drive i see it mounts, but i can not access it unless i am root.\nDoing ls -l on the mount i get no access permissions:\n\n$ pwd\n/media\n$ ls -l\nd--------- 4 haimov haimov 136 2011-05-06 05:22 UDF Volume\n\nWhat can be the problem?\n\nA: In the file /etc/fstab on the line concerning the DVD/CD drive, in the forth space separated column, does it have the word 'user' or 'users'?

This you must have very clear. With this I mean that what you learn in Red Hat, Fedora, Open Suse, Linux Mint, Debian, Gentoo and others, you have a VERY HIGH chance that you can use them in Ubuntu and Vice Versa.\nWith this said, any place that teaches you some command (Like ls, cat, grep, etc....) will work in any distro.\nFor common commands I suggest this: http://linux.die.net/\nFor bash commands I suggest this: http://tldp.org/ and http://www.hypexr.org/\nBut you also need to know that the stack Network has 2 sites that dedicate themselves to similar questions, https://superuser.com/ and https://unix.stackexchange.com/\nFor even more in depth to Servers and Security you have https://serverfault.com/ and https://security.stackexchange.com/\nLastly a dedicated Ubuntu Help book would be found here: http://ubuntu-manual.org/downloads and for 10.10 here: https://help.ubuntu.com/10.10/\n\nA: Regarding files and directories in Ubuntu/Linux, you'll want to read about the Linux Filesystem Hierarchy Standard.

I'm looking for an application with the following requirements (in order of importance):\n\n\n*\n\n*Easily work with OpenVPN\n\n*Let me select individual files in a torrent. \n\n*Good command line interface\n\n*A web ui to connect to from the local network.\n\n*Ease of setup\n\n\nI've been looking at these forums and it seems rtorrent, deluge, and transmission are the most popular and all three seem to support the above. Is this correct? \nWhat about the alpha version of the utorrent? \nAny general tips about diving into this?\nThanks for your input! \n\nA: OpenVPN should be transparent to the application, so it should work regardless of which client you choose.\nPersonally I use transmission(-daemon). It has a well written interface with both web, stateless command line and ncurses command line interfaces. It is also very easy to set up.\nIt works great for me at least ;)\n\nA: Torrentflux should do what you need, I've had a play with uTorrent and it isn't there yet.\nHaven't heard of the other ones.\n\nA: rTorrent sounds like it meets all your requirements (perhaps a bit lacking on the ease of setup, but well worth the trouble.) It's available in the repos but if you want a web GUI you'll need to compile it yourself with XMLRPC support. The wiki for ruTorrent has a good guide on how to compile rTorrent and make it ready for ruTorrent's web GUI.\n\n\n\nA: torrentflux\nweb based, feature-rich BitTorrent download managerTorrentFlux is a PHP based BitTorrent controller that runs on a web server. It can manage all of your BitTorrent downloads from anywhere through a convenient and easy-to-use web interface. TorrentFlux uses a MySQL database to manage the downloads. This database may be automatically created and maintained for you (if you want), but that requires the recommended mysql-client package. If you do not have a remote database server to access, you will also need the recommended mysql-server package. (If you’re not sure, then you probably need both.)\nTorrentFlux enables you to run BitTorrent downloads unattended on a monitor-less or remote server 24 hours a day, while still maintaining complete control from any web browser. Now you can control your downloading on your firewall, or keep up with downloads while on vacation. It uses the BitTornado client to download files, and also requires a web server with PHP.\nSome of the many features:\n\n\n*\n\n*Upload Torrents via URL or File Upload\n\n*Start, Stop, and Delete Torrents with ease\n\n*Advanced Torrent start options (ports, speeds, etc.)\n\n*Multi-user interface\n\n*RSS Feeds, download Torrents files with a click\n\n*Run several torrents at once\n\n*View Download Progress of all torrents at a glance\n\n*View drive space at a glance\n\n*View Torrent file meta information\n\n*Built-in User management and Security\n\n*Private Messaging\n\n*Themes (selectable per user)\n\n*Upload History\n\n*Detailed User Administration\n\n*Admin Searchable Logs\n\n*Torrent Search (many popular sites)\n\n*Language Support\n\n*Make your own torrents\n\n*Add torrents to a download Queue\n\n*NFO / Text viewer\n\n\nInstall torrentflux in Ubuntu\n\nsudo aptitude install torrentflux\n\n\nA: you should try utorrent using wine and why not the alpha linux version.\nUs\n", "Q: Updating UFW (uncomplicated Firewall) doesn't affect existing connections Can anyone tell me whether or not new or updated rules made to ubuntu (v10.10) UFW should affect existing connections? I have noticed that these only take effect the next time I try to reconnect, which doesn't seem to me the way a firewall should behave!\nWhat I'm trying to achieve here is to simulate a connection being lost/dropped in a socket based client. \nIs there any way to update these rules immediately so as they affect existing connection?\n\nA: if the connection is already on when you update the firewall, your connection is Established and you probably have a rule to allow Established and Related connections. This rule is necessary to allow answers from IPs you connect to.\nAfter updating the firewall, you have to drop the connection or restart network or interface to drop the connection and loose the Established status.\n\nA: I think you can lock the firewall and force all connections to drop.

I have never managed to get network manager to work on any machine I have installed it on. Five machines desktops, laptops, netbooks and a tablet. WICD always works perfectly but WICD does not support public wifi or VPN. Is there a tool that allows VPN access and public wifi use on Ubuntu?\n\nA: It all depends on what type of VPN you want to connect to, and they are not as integrated as NetworkManager. In my experience, kvpnc tends to work well and supports a few VPN systems, although it requires the installation of additional dependencies from a standard GNOME desktop because of QT and KDE libraries.\nIf you're having issues with NetworkManager, you definitely should report bugs and clearly explain what is not working for you, then we can look into the problem and possibly fix it ;)\n\nA: Dear Mathieu\nThank you for your reply. The problems I have are bugs that are widely reported. Network manager does not see wireless networks. On every machine I have put it on after every install of Ubuntu network Manager reports there are no wireless networks visible. If i remove network manager and install WICD then those networks are visible and accessible. If network manager and WICD are both installed then neither can see wireless networks. I am afraid I have on idea why it occurs, I think it is unlikely to be a driver issue. But if you Google WICD you find literally hundreds of \"solved\" wifi issues upon removal of network manager and installation of WICD. I should make clear, no other changes are required, no extra drivers or anything. This has been true in all version from me since 9.04 on 5 computers, laptop and desktop\nIn wired mode network manager works but corrupts required settings after circa one week. And therefore again in wired mode WICD is stable, network manager is not.\nThe problem is WICD is feature poor, no VPN and no ad hoc networks\n\nA: You need to explain what is going wrong.

I've read a few articles now about changing the swappiness level on Ubuntu to possibly increase performance. But I'm very unfamiliar with how swappiness works, would I benefit from increasing, or reducing it? \nI have 6GB of DDR2.\n\nA: Well, Swap is used to increase the amount of Virtual memory the system has, but it's only of use if you max out your RAM.\nIt uses a chunk of the Hard drive as RAM, but since it's not proper physical RAM it's slower than actual RAM, the transfer rates of a hard drive are slower than those of RAM.\n\nA: What's it set to now? How are you using your system?\nLinux tends not to use swap much, whatever the settings are, and to be quite efficient with use of system RAM. My desktop system at home, which has only 1 GB of RAM, almost never needs to use swap space; the server systems I monitor in my job, with more RAM but heavier workloads, rarely use much swap space, and we get warnings when they use more than a little.\nMost likely, a system with 6 GB of RAM, being used as a desktop, is going to be fine without any special tweaking of swap settings.\n\nA: with that amount of ram, it will probably never touch the swap file anyway, but just in case, make the \"swapiness\" between 0 and 10. it actually solved my flash playback issues and some more dramatic performance increases as well. 1gb ram and (someone send me a better processor, prefereably amd.) a 3.06ghz celeron.\nid say do it anyway, cause you have nothing to lose.\n\nA: Swap space is required not only for virtual memory but also it requires if you need hibernation. Also, it is not at all true that system doesn't use swap space. Swap space is being used while running large programs such as Libre Office or GIMP or video editors. The relevance of swap space lays when at any moment system to handle a large amount of memory and it can rely upon swap space to get rid of it. \nMoreover, there are many opinions pertaining to how much swap space required in a system. Well, it actually depends upon amount of RAM. If memory is low as 500 MB almost double of SWAP space can be set up. For a machine with 1 GB ram, 1 GB ram is sufficient. I have setup 2 GB swap space for my 1 GB netbook with atom processor. However, I could notice system is using nearly 300-400 MB of swap space while it is running busy. \nYou can check it by using command free in terminal.\n", "Q: PGP KeyServers: Creating Personal Keyserver Is it possible to create your own PGP KeyServer on Ubuntu to host PGP keys?\n\nA: You can use sks to build your own keyserver.

How would I do it?\n\nA: Do you have a recent kernel? PowerTOP is checking for an older option that was renamed to CONFIG_INOTIFY_USER, see this bug report. Of course, you should make sure that your kernel has CONFIG_INOTIFY_USER enabled -- if you have a stock kernel you should be fine. If you built your own and are using make menuconfig then look under Filesystems->Inotify Support for Userspace and make sure that is checked.\n\nA: CONFIG_INOTIFY is an option you can enable when building a Kernel - it is not an option you can manually enable via (for example) a grub boot option.\nSome of the more recent kernels are built with CONFIG_INOTIFY=y - for example, in Maverick.\nTo see if your particular version of Ubuntu has its kernels built with this option, look here for your distribution & kernel type.

I am considering buying a Dell XPS 15 laptop. The laptop has a Nvidia 420m card which should work with Linux but I keep reading that the Nvidia Optimus technology isn't supported on Linux. I am not really interested in switching from Nvidia to Intel to save power but need to know that the Nvidia card will in fact work if I installed Ubuntu.\nIf anyone has experience using a Nvidia card with Optimus technology or even better the exact laptop in question (Dell XPS 15 with 1GB NVIDIA® GeForce®  GT 420M) it would be great.\nA major problem holding people back from adopting Linux is this sort of hardware issue.\nI am a long term Ubuntu user and supporter who can't afford to make a mistake with a purchase like this.\nI don't want to spend £500+ to find I have no graphics acceleration because Windows 7 is not an option.\n\nA: Currently there is Bumblebee to support nVidia Optimus.\nI have a Dell Latitude E6520 with Intel Core i5 (with built-in Intel graphics) and an nVidia 420M graphics card. You can run a program with optirun (type optirun programname in a terminal to start programname) and then it will be able to use the nVidia graphics.\nI haven't tried it with CUDA programs.\n\nA: Update as of Ubuntu 12.10:\nAll the pieces of the graphics stack required to support hybrid graphics made it into 12.10; the Quantal Quetzal has the infrastructure to support for hybrid graphics - both to extend the display when the external monitors can only be driven by the discrete chip, and to run applications on the discrete chip and display them on the integrated GPU.\nThere are two caveats, though, one large, one minor.\nThe minor caveat is that there's no GUI support - there's no obvious way to run an application on the discrete GPU. You can do this by setting the DRI_PRIME=1 environment variable before starting an application.\nThe major caveat is that this only applies to the free drivers - nouveau, radeon, and intel. Nvidia has now expressed interest in supporting hybrid graphics on linux, but the dma-buf kernel symbols they need to use are marked as GPL, which they won't use.\nAdditionally the hybrid support has seen only light testing, and there are still pieces that remain to be implemented, like synchronisation across GPUs to prevent tearing.\nStatus as of Ubuntu 12.04 LTS:\nnVidia's official position is that they have no plans to support Optimus on Linux - our graphics stack is engineered with an assumption that only one card is driving a given display, and it's not easy to work around.\nDave Airlie has done a lot of work untangling this in the X server and kernel, and that'll likely be rebased on the drm-buf work that's primarily come out of the ARM world via Linaro. Once this is all up and running - which seems to be 6 months to a year away - it'll be possible to do hybrid graphics correctly. At that point nVidia might reconsider supporting Optimus on Linux, as it will no longer be a huge technical mess to implement¹.\nIn terms of supporting hybrid graphics now, the Bumblebee project does something along those lines. It essentially runs a second X server on the nVidia card and copies across the output of the rendering. This is not as bad as it might sound - that's basically what the nVidia card does under Windows 7, too, just with a little bit of hardware support.\nThe Ubuntu X team does not plan to support Bumblebee or Ironhide (a fork of Bumblebee).\nIf your system has a BIOS option to switch between the Intel and nVidia cards then you can chose between them.\nIf your system has a hardware mux - so both the nVidia and Intel GPUs are connected to the outputs - and vga_swicheroo works, you can use that interface to switch between them, but only if you're using the open-source drivers. For 12.04 we plan to ensure that the unused GPU is turned off in this case, which should improve battery life.\nIf your system doesn't have a BIOS option and doesn't have a hardware mux that vga_switcheroo knows how to drive then your nVidia card will not be usable on 12.04.\n¹: AMD's fglrx driver has some support for hybrid graphics. It appears to do this by pretending to be an X server and loading the Intel driver itself. This is not a clean solution ☺.\n\nA: Nvidia drivers won't work because Dell does not have a BIOS option to select a graphics card. Try a stable release of bumblebee. It worked for me yesterday on a Dell l502x (525M card) and I verified after rebooting multiple times. By default Intel would be used but you can run applications using NVIDIA by command optirun then. Also you will have to restart bumblebee after booting.\n\nA: I think NVidia Optimus works just fine with Ironhide on both 11.10 and 11.04. I think any advice to not purchase an Optimus laptop is pedantic and overbearing. Who needs to run a graphics monster on a Linux laptop 24x7? The intel GPU is much better on power and as far as I can tell, Ironhide does not run the NVidia GPU until you invoke Optirun. I am very happy with my Optimus laptop.\nThe lack of proper support for external monitors (I cant get 1080i resolution) is a SandyBridge Intel HD3000 issue which I trust will be sorted in later releases. This issue has nothing to do with Optimus and will be present on all Intel HD3000 laptops.\nThis guide is for Dell XPS17 L702x laptops and Oneiric, but I believe it should work for most Optimus laptops.\nBe sure to remove all NVidia drivers before following the links above, and the best of luck!\n\nA: Even if the Supported Products tab on the driver download page says that GT420M is supported, the Optimus variants are not supported. From the Additional Information tab:\n\nSome designs incorporating supported GPUs may not be compatible with the Nvidia Linux driver: in particular, notebook and all-in-one desktop designs with switchable (hybrid) or Optimus graphics will not work if means to disable the integrated graphics in hardware are not available.\n\nThis Optimus design means that the discrete Nvidia card is wired into the integrated Intel GPU and that it's not connected to a monitor at all. Some hybrid graphics laptops still allow you to choose the Nvidia card in BIOS, but most modern Optimus laptops don't have this option.\nI am speaking from experience, I have a GT425M combined with an i5-460M processor. If there is no BIOS or hardware setting for switching / disabling the card, you're throwing away your money. The XPS 15 family does not appear to have any of these features. Although you are able to use the Intel graphics card, you may want to use the Nvidia card as well because you've paid for it which is not directly possible at the moment.\nYou'd better look for another laptop without Optimus. Optimus is crap and Nvidia refuses to provide better support for Linux. If you are adventurous and buy such a notebook, visit the Linux Hybrid Graphics blog and subscribe to its Launchpad mailing list. Visit their wiki for various ways to get such a card (hopefully) working. One method is called Bumblebee which allows you to render programs on your nvidia card. I currently recommend it over other solutions (disclosure: I'm a developer of it).\nUbuntu 12.10 Quantal will be shipped with the first bits for real support for hybrid graphics laptops, called PRIME. This is highly experimental and in development and probably not stable enough for many people. Only the open-source graphics drivers support this, though Nvidia may release support in the future too if it is not too much work for them. This page tracks hybrid graphics support for Quantal, these are the blueprints for Raring.\nIf you've installed the driver from nvidia.com\nYou've made a huge mistake by installing the drivers directly from nvidia.com. If you want to have newer drivers, add the ubuntu-x-swat/x-updates PPA because these will install the nvidia drivers in such a way that your Optimus system does not die.\nAfter installing the nvidia driver from nvidia.com, you may experience loss of all graphics effects, black screen or very slow graphics performance.

You will not be able to even use the NVIDIA graphics in your Ubuntu. You will need to work with the integrated Intel Graphics drivers (to the extent they are supported for your platform -- Sandy Bridge support is still weak). \nIt should be noted that Optimus is different from the older ability to switch between the integrated (usually Intel) and discrete (NVIDIA, ATI) graphics systems. With Optimus, the integrated graphics path is always in use and lets you (additionally) enable the discrete graphics when required -- this needs Windows 7 at the moment (afaik, won't work on Vista either).  \nHere are a few references to get up to speed on this.\n\n\n*\n\n*UbuntuForums: nVidia Optimus and Ubuntu explained  \n\n*phoronix: Will NVIDIA Optimus Inevitably Come To Linux?\nPosted by Michael Larabel on April 25, 2011\nhint: I use a XPS 15 L502x with the 525M Optimus discrete graphics.  \n\nUpdate: This is a quote from the NVIDIA Drivers 270.06 page in the Additional Information tab.\n\nSome designs incorporating supported GPUs may not be compatible with the NVIDIA Linux driver: in particular, notebook and all-in-one desktop designs with switchable (hybrid) or Optimus graphics will not work if means to disable the integrated graphics in hardware are not available.\n\nNow you know what to look for in your new NVIDIA based laptop specs if you want to drive the NVIDIA from linux.\n\nUpdate: Look at the Bumblebee-Project.\nStart from the README there.  \n\nA: The bumblebee solution allows you to run both the integrated card and the discrete nvidia optimus card at the same time. Then acpi_call and byo-switcheroo provide different mechanisms for switching on/off the discrete graphics card, depending on your specific laptop model. Things are relatively better supported now than they were in the past, have a look at:\nhttp://launchpad.net/~hybrid-graphics-linux\n\nA: \nA major problem holding people back from adopting Linux is this sort of hardware issue. I am a long term Ubuntu user and supporter who can't afford to make a mistake with a purchase like this. I don't want to spend £500+ to find I have no graphics acceleration because Windows7 is not an option.\n\nIf you are a long term Linux user you should understand that hardware compatibility relies on hardware manufacturers. We must give Linux/kernel community some time to adopt this new technology. At the end what we usually have is really competitive CPU management in Linux compared to any other OS. But it takes time.\nBe patient my friend.\n\nA: For anyone, that has or is gonna buy a Laptop with Nvidia Optimus, like I did: \nAs of this date, it works perfectly. I followed the steps pointed out by Lekensteyn's answer on a Packard Bell EasyNote TS Laptop, with an Intel HD3000 and Geforce GT 540M (1GB) and can use both graphic devices now under Ubuntu 12.04. \nThe only thing I had to do first was, to change into the BIOS to use only the integrated Intel graphics (I had to reinstall like that, as my first try ended to have no suitable driver choicen on reboot and a messed up videomode). With both activated, compiz/3D would not have been active before/after Ubuntu install. With only the integrated graphics activated in the BIOS, 3D with Intel graphics was completely active from the install screen already. \nThis would have given me the choice, to use Bumblebee for just powersaving without ever installing any Nvidia driver. \nFinally, I activated both graphics in the BIOS and installed Bumblebee and the bumblebee-nvidia package and it works like a charm. By using \"glxgears -info\" and \"optirun glxgears -info\" I can confirm, it runs either with the Intel or the Nvidia graphics. I actually like the usage of \"optirun\" even better than the automatic switch under Win7, because I can decide now, if I want to use better graphics or not to safe battery. \n\nA: Currently (as of 13.04 IIRC) if you download the NVIDIA binary driver via Additional Drivers, it will automatically install nvidia-prime along with it.\nThen, once you install and reboot, you can change to discrete graphics by changing the renderer under the PRIME section in nvidia-settings, and X11 will use it on the next login.\nHowever, I find that this causes ATROCIOUS tearing, so I still would not recommend using this option. So, if you want to install Bumblebee as others have suggested, don't fret. All you need to do before installing Bumblebee is simply to remove the nvidia-prime package.\n\nA: Prior to ubuntu 14.04 this question was valid - now its not an issue - I have an Nvidia card with Optimus and suffered getting things like WebGL to work properly and had to resort to using bumblbee in prior years - however when I did a clean drive wipe / install 14.04 even the default nouveau drivers now render graphics like a champ - WebGL is now effortless !!!\n\nA: It does't work well at all.\nIf you are planning to use Linux as your main OS, do not buy an Nvidia Optimus-based computer! \nPlease ! Just don't do it... it will be the most horrible mistake in your life.\nI am not trying to be hard or evil. I'm just saying that all the problems with Nvidia, Bumblebee, HDMI not working, Intel not doing a great job (because we bought an Nvidia laptop and is the Intel that is doing the whole job), No Flash at more than 480p (just forget it) in full screen.\nIf you are thinking about buying a computer just because it has a good battery and it is little so you can play 3D games correctly with Windows or watch flash and HD Movies with Windows, than yes you can go ahead and buy it.\nBut if you want to buy it to use Ubuntu (or any Linux Distribution) as your most used OS than please do yourself a favour and don't buy it... or just wait until the problems are solved... and I promise you, it is going take a LONG time before we see something working.\nFinally, Bumblebee/Ironhide is not a solution.\n\nA: To answer the question:\nIt's horrible. First of all, forget about the hybrid mode (Optimus). Sure, there's Bumblebee, but it's unfinished, complex and doesn't work most of the time (don't expect a one click install!). For me, it's absolutely useless. Manually disabling a gpu (integrated one or dedicated one) does not save energy anyway.\nWhen it comes to the drivers, things did not get better for me: After installing the default proprietary drivers I got a lot of trouble, Xorg not starting up anymore. Using the real nvidia drivers made things worse.\nSo right now, I'm using the crappy and buggy opensource drivers. I'm having graphical issues every now and then, but it's the only way I can get GFX acceleration. Ubuntu without GFX acceleration is total fail: Unity-2D is buggy (more than Unity with acceleration) and I feel it's underdeveloped. XFCE was my only temporary solution until I got the opensource drivers working again. XFCE is nice (it has software rendering for transparency and such), but you'll need to spend some time for getting things like a global menu to work in XFCE.\nIn a nutshell: it's all good as long as you don't try to install better drivers. At least, that was the case for me. If you want to run games (probably through wine), I don't think the opensource drivers will get you far.\nAlso don't expect a great battery life. (for me: 4h30-5h00 under windows, 1h45 under ubuntu!!! And I've tried everything I could find on the net...)\nI've got a GT540m 1Gb and an Intel IGP (I disabled the latter trying to win some battery life, but to no avail).\n\nA: here you can find simple instructions on installing nvidia drivers in ubuntu: http://www.webupd8.org/2010/06/how-to-install-nvidia-25635-display.html\nbear in mind, that nvidia does not provide any support for the optimus technology under linux, wich is probably enabled by default in your BIOS. There are two solutions for this problem:\n\n\n*\n\n*disable optimus in your bios. This is the simple solution. Works well for me\n\n*use bumblebee. this one is not as easy as disabling optimus in BIOS, but seems to work.\n\n\nA: I installed Ubuntu 12.04.3 on a new ASUS K55VM laptop which comes with i7 ivybridge and nvidia GT630M. I was surprised to notice that nvidia 319 driver with nvidia prime installed right out of the box with both HDMI and nvidia working well. I then got a similar laptop and installed Kubuntu but this time with Bumblebee and 310 drivers but no nvidia prime. I also installed Manjaro on the same laptop, Manjaro installs nvidia 325 with kernel 310 and Bumblebee. The FPS on the nvidia prime laptop was the highest but it did run bit warmer at idle compared to the two others, also battery consumption was a bit higher but thats expected because the nvidia card runs all the time. However these numbers were trivial, 2-3c average temps higher at idle compared to Kubuntu with Manjaro running coolest with 5c less temp than the Ubuntu machine. For battery consumption, I use TLC on all machines and the nvidia prime one lost out by half hour to one hour to the other two machines but it gained quite well on FPS.\n", "Q: Is there a VRML2 (VRML97 / WRL) viewer? Is there a VRML2 (VRML97) viewer that works out of the box for Ubuntu? I've heard about  g3dviewer (no support for VRML2), and also about freeWRL, whitedune and VRMLViewer - but I cannot find any .debs of these, and it seems their building from source is rather involved. \nblender can import these files - but I'd want a quick viewer here; if I have a directory with 4-5 wrl files, I have to import each in blender, then delete everything from blender so I can load and display the next one.\nAny suggestions? \n\nA: Both 10.04.3 LTS and 11.10 oneiric have whitedune and it seems to work ok. Install it with a package manager or sudo apt-get install whitedune.\n", "Q: How do I share my NIC which has internet connectivity with another NIC? On my main computer, I have one interface eth0 which uses DHCP to obtain an ip address, dns addresses and it's  gateway ip address. It has successful connectivity to the internet. \nI have another interface eth1 which uses a static ip address which provides NFS services to another computer, let's call this other computer nfs-client. I want nfs-client to be able to have internet connectivity also! However i do not want to join it to the same network as eth0. \nHere is a simple diagram:\n         +-----------+             +-----------+             +-----------+ \n         |           |             |Ubuntu     |             |           | \n         |ADSL Router|-------------|Computer   |-------------|NFS Client | \n         |           |             |(2 NICS)   |             |           | \n         |           |             |           |             |           | \n         +-----------+             +-----------+             +-----------+\n\n. \nI simply want to keep my network topology and give nfs-client internet connectivity via the main computer.

This isn't any kind of security issue; I just want updates to be faster. I've tried using the -n and -e flags with '.*' to no avail.\n\nA: You can define directories that should be omitted in /etc/updatedb.conf. You can use regular expressions, citing GNU:\n\n--prunepaths='path...'\n  Directories to omit from the database, which would otherwise be\n  included. The environment variable\n  PRUNEPATHS also sets this value.\n  Default is /tmp /usr/tmp /var/tmp\n  /afs. The paths are used as regular\n  expressions (with find ... -regex, so\n  you need to specify these paths in the\n  same way that find will encounter\n  them. This means for example that the\n  paths must not include trailing\n  slashes.\n\nSo change the following line in /etc/updatedb.conf:\nPRUNEPATHS=\"/tmp /var/spool /media\"\n\nto:\nPRUNEPATHS=\"/tmp /var/spool /media .*/\\..*\"\n\nshould work just fine ;-)\n", "Q: ssh connection closes after successful login I am trying to run ssh on my computer so I can control it with my android phone.

probably a fault at the servers-side. \nWith the information given currently, it is quite hard to figure out what went wrong.\nTake a look at the server-side logs : grep 'sshd' /var/log/auth.log\nYou could try using ssh -v or ssh -vv to get a more detailed output on the client side, but I suppose the auth.log is more promising.\nOnce that information is gathered, you could edit your question to describe the problem more properly!\nEdit:\nAnother option might be setting \"LogLevel INFO\" to \"LogLevel DEBUG\" in /etc/sshd_config and gathering more output from the server.\nPlease go through your logs before posting them, the man page warns that a high LogLevel might impair privacy.\n\nA: Here's another possiblity, in case anyone finds this while searching like I did:  same symptoms, SSH session closes after entering password.  My variation was that SSH from the server to itself worked, but would fail after authentication from any external source.  \nI'd looked at most of the above suggestions already.  When I finally ran sshd with DEBUG3 I noticed it was doing a reverse DNS look up on the source IP.  \nWhat I finally found was that the DNS resolvers had been set up originally while we were in the middle of upgrading the DNS servers, so the first resolver IP was still one of the temporary transition IPs that was now gone.  Seems the extra delay with all the DNS timeouts was enough for the SSHD login process to time out.  I set the correct DNS resolver IPs and SSH started working flawlessly.\n\nA: I had a similar problem\nWith one user I could connect so I checked /etc/passwd. I saw this user could connect with bash, the other (not working) with fish\nSo I changed to bash and both worked.\nThen I put it back to fish, and analysed my fish config and removed a line at the end that was added with byobu-enable. Then it worked. Then I reran byobu-enable and it works.\nNo idea what happened and it's a VERY specific case but I think I had the config file open while I ran byobu-enable and it messed things up\n", "Q: command line thumbnailing I have a whole folder of photos I want to look at as thumbnails, and I'd like to do it by calling one of GNOME's native thumbnailers individually, namely totem-video-thumbnailer or evince-thumbnailer, and piping them through a backend (I hear gstreamer is possible, but anything that allows me to manually call forth a whole foldersworth of thumbnails from the command line will do). \n\nA: I have this polaroid.sh-Skript:\n#!/bin/bash\n#\n# jpg-Dateien in Vorschau umwandeln.\n#\nmontage -size 256x256 './*jpg' \\\n    -thumbnail 128x128 \\\n    -set caption '%t' \\\n    -bordercolor AliceBlue \\\n    -background grey20 \\\n    -polaroid 0 \\\n    -set label '' \\\n    -background white \\\n    -geometry +1+1 \\\n    -tile 4x  $1.html && firefox ./$1.html\n\nMaybe you can adopt some ideas.

What Media Center solutions exist for Ubuntu?\n\nA: Here is some of my preferred apps.  \n1) VLC  - install \nI included this app because you can use it to manage your audio and it can play almost every video formats out there. It is light on the system, simple, and has so many features (see this for example).\n \n2) Enna  - install \nEnna is beatyful. It shows the weather and besides audio, photo and video, it supports bookstore.  \n \n3) XBMC    - install`  \nIt is easy to use, support audio, pictures, video, and is \"skinnable\". See Aeon skin next.  \n \n4) Boxee    - To install you will have to sign up\nIt is not so eye candy, but it is functional, support TV shows and has some Premium payable features.  \n \n5) Miro    - install \nSupport for download from torrent and youtube.  \n \n6) Freevo    - install \nSupport for music, photos, videos and games.  \n\n7) MythTv    - install \nCan record videos for you.  \n \n8) LinuxMCE    - To install you will have to download a binary package \nIt has others features like controls over your home lights, doors, security, etc.\n\n\nA: As Aenima99x stated, XMBC which is a complete home theater solution with great themes, plugins, massive media capabilites, and overall looks great in your living room. \nAnother great suggestion is Boxee which can be installed on top of Ubuntu similar to XMBC. Boxee is less configurable than XMBC, but offers great plugins with a fantastic beginning layout, and is a bit more simple to work with. \nLastly, if you don't need a pretty UI for your movies, you can just install Ubuntu as normal and use the Medibuntu Repository to handle all of your media needs. This won't give you a nice skin like the previous two options, in fact it will be just like having a normal computer as a media center, but it contains a lot of great tools for that setup. \nAlso feel free to use any combination of the above suggestions, and play around with different setups.

I would like to try it first on a non-essential computer, but the most likely candidate is a test box I run a wubi install on.       \nShould this work?    \nDo I boot from the USB like I normally would, or is there another procedure?    \nShould this emulate the results I would expect when upgrading a normal install?\n\nA: You can only upgrade a Wubi install while booted into that install, so either using update manager, or from the alternate desktop CD image (cdromupgrade).\nYou cannot do it from Windows or by booting an Ubuntu CD/USB.\nYou can only upgrade to 11.04 from 10.10 - so you'd first need to upgrade from 10.04 to 10.10, but note that there are some problems with the wubi upgrade to 10.10 (bug 653134 and bug 610898). These have been fixed for 11.04, but until the fix is backported to 10.10 you will likely suffer booting problems. You can find a solution for these problems here: Wubi megathread\nWith any upgrade I recommend backing up beforehand. With Wubi you can just copy the virtual disks (usually just the root.disk) in Windows beforehand. It's a good idea to copy C:\\wubildr as well.\n", "Q: Can access NAS by SSH in terminal but not through Nautilus I have a Synology DS411 and have SSH access through Terminal.\nI've tried just about every walkthrough for how to connect to an SSH server in Nautilus but nothing has worked. \nAny ideas why?\nIs Nautilus using SFTP or something for it's SSH connections?\nCome to mention it - I have tried setting up FTP connections to the server through Nautilus (I'm using Elementary if it matters) and it crashes after I enter the password.\nI can use Filezilla with the same connection info fine. Not sure why it's a problem in Nautilus. Only reason I want to move on from Filezilla is very slow transfer speeds.

Is it some driver issue ?\n\nA: Most probably it is the driver issue (it's a single driver, called Alsa, and is part of the Linux kernel).\nThe best you can do is get a Ubuntu 11.04 LiveUSB (see http://www.ubuntu.com/desktop/get-ubuntu/download section 2) and boot your computer. If the mic now works, then the latest Linux kernel 2.6.38 (with Alsa 1.0.24) fixes your issue, and you simply need to upgrade your Linux.\nIf you do not want to upgrade yet, you can simply install the Alsa driver 1.0.24 onto Ubuntu 10.04, according to the instructions at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Audio/InstallingLinuxAlsaDriverModules (you use a PPA repository).\nThis is mostly for testing, and when you get an Ubuntu 10.04 kernel update, your mic might not work until the corresponding driver in the PPA gets updated.\n", "Q: GNOME 3 Shell keyboard/mouse shortcuts What keyboard or mouse shortcuts for GNOME 3 exist ?\n\nA: This should help:\nGnomeShell CheatSheet\nTaken from that page, is a list of main key bindings:\n\n\n*\n\n*Super key: Switch between overview and desktop\n\n\n*Alt+F1: Switch between overview and desktop\n\n\n*Alt+F2: Pop up command dialog\n\n\n*Super+F10: Open Application Menu\n\n\n*Alt+Tab: Pop up application switcher\n\n\n*Alt+Shift+Tab:\nCycle in reverse direction in the\napplication switcher\n\n\n*Alt+` key above Tab: Switch between windows of\nthe same application in Alt+Tab\n\n\n*Ctrl+Alt+Tab: Pop up accessibility switcher\n\n\n*Ctrl+Shift+Alt+R:\nStart and end screencast recording\n\n\n*Ctrl+Alt+Up/Down arrow: Switch between workspaces\n\n\n*Ctrl+Alt+Shift+Up/Down\narrow: Move the current window\nto a different workspace\n\n\n*F10: Toggle maximize\n\n\n*F11: Toggle full screen\n\n\n*Super + Up arrow: Toggle maximize\n\n\n*Super + Down arrow: Toggle unmaximize\n\n\n*Super + Left/Right arrow: Dock left/right\n\n\n*Super + Shift + Left/Right arrow: Move window to left/right monitor\n\nYou can view the rest of the keyboard shortcuts and modify them by looking at the configuration:\n\n*\n\n*In older Ubuntu versions: Settings -> Devices -> Keyboard\n\n*In Ubuntu 21.04: Settings -> Keyboard shortcuts\n\nA: To view/change keyboard shortcuts, you must be aware that there are two places with registered keyboard shortcuts.

If I place a shell script in /etc/cron.daily/, at what time of the day will it be executed? \n\nA: Approximately 7:35am, but the exact timing will depend on anacron.\nBy default cron delegates the running of /etc/cron.daily jobs to anacron.  /etc/crontab contains the line: \n25 6    * * *   root    test -x /usr/sbin/anacron || ( cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.daily )\n\nbut this defines the behaviour if anacron is not installed\nWith anacron installed, the running of cron.daily jobs is controlled by the entry in /etc/anacrontab:\n1   5   cron.daily   nice run-parts --report /etc/cron.daily\n\nwhich says run these jobs once per day, with a delay of 5 minutes.  \nanacron itself is run by cron, as specified in the file /etc/cron.d/anacron, which runs anacron at 7:30am.\n\nA: Looking at /etc/crontab it should run at 06:25.\n17 *    * * *   root    cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.hourly\n25 6    * * *   root    test -x /usr/sbin/anacron || ( cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.daily )\n47 6    * * 7   root    test -x /usr/sbin/anacron || ( cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.weekly )\n52 6    1 * *   root    test -x /usr/sbin/anacron || ( cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.monthly )\n\n\nA: As indicated by other answers, the result depends on whether anacron is installed. On a desktop, it is installed by default, BUT crucially it is not installed in the server distribution. So the answer is around 06:25 on a server and about 07:35 on a desktop.\n\nA: To elaborate on the other answers, on newer systems anacron is managed by systemd. On my Ubuntu 19.10 system anacron runs from 7:30 - 23:30 every hour, with a randomized delay of 5 minutes. Anacron then runs cron.daily scripts with a 5 minute delay as defined in /etc/anacrontab.\nIn addition to that systemd only starts anacron when the system is connected to AC power.

I haven't tried it, but I saw the option there today.\n\nA: I'm having the same problem, and I'm not familiar with how the Unity Launcher works exactly, but I know I used to have this same problem in Windows 7. It stemmed from the application (chrome) not supporting the launcher properly - not the other way around - due to its tendency to have several processes running at once. There should be a workaround on one side of the fence (either with the launcher or chrome itself?)\nIt's also noteworthy that I've been testing all sorts of programs on the launcher, and as of yet, Chrome is the only one that does this.\n\nA: In my case, the restored window, and newly created windows, were opening off to the right of my visible display.\nThis persisted through a logoff.\nclick on the Chrome icon in the task bar, alt-f7 left arrow until the window appears on screen.\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/stable/ubuntu-help/shell-windows-states.html.en\n", "Q: Wanting to start development for Ubuntu (and most Linux distributions in general), which is suitable? Python or Vala? I'm a computer science graduate, and learned languages like C, C++, C# and Java. Though I have more experience with Java. I want to develop for Linux and I'd prefer to develop for GNOME, I'm confused between choosing one from the Python and Vala.\nAfter going through some documentation on Vala on GNOME Live pages, it seems more familiar to me compared to Python, which is quite a different syntactically compared to most languages I've learned during my graduation. While learning curve in Vala seems smaller to me. So, which language should I choose to begin development, which has better support in variety of distributions. A recommended IDE for suggested language will be appreciated.\nThanks.\n\nA: I'd recommend Vala. You seem to prefer object-oriented languages and Vala is object-oriented by design. Python has OOP capabilities too, but they're not that integrated into the other parts - that's why Ruby was created.\nPython is considered easier to learn and use, but it's a very original language, with its own logic and philosophy; I think Vala will be easier to learn to you because it's very similar to C# and Java.\nThe choice also depends on what apps you're going to write. Python is good for scripting and quick prototyping, but its GTK bindings are currently poor and very slow. The language itself is at about 40 times slower than C in various benchmarks. Vala, on the other hand, is a C preprocessor, so programs written in it run very fast, and it's designed to be used in GNOME.\n\nA: I would suggest you start with Python as it's really easy to create PyGTK apps. This free book is a great resource for developing Gnome apps with Python. \nVala is great too but you'll find yourself more comfortable with Python as a beginner. \nLater on, once you get acquainted with the philosophy of Unix app development, you can create parts of your app in python or vala or Javascript as you feel the need.\nI would say, start with PyGTK (PyGI) to get the feel of the platform and then learn Vala and Javascript. Javascript is going to be HUGE on the Gnome desktop. I mean HUGE.\nThe binding for GTK, they are the same for all apps now. You'll be using the same C bindings from any language using Gobject Introspection. \n\nA: Other than the old argument about which programming language is better, which I won't get into (even though Python is the greatest thing since sliced bread), I'd say both are equally well suited to writing Apps for the Gnome desktop.\nPygtk, the Python GTK bindings, have been used to create applications like PiTiVi, Deluge, emesene, Exaile, Jokosher, and WingIDE. \nI can't find a list of applications written in Vala (though I know about Shotwell). But since it's very much designed to be a language for the Gnome destkop, you can be pretty sure you won't be disappointed by its GTK/GObject integration.\nTry them both and use which ever you like best. They are both excellent tools to create GTK Applications. You might also want to take a look at Some Vala code and Some Python code.\n\nA: Python has a lot of good documentation / books. For Vala I don't know.\n\nA: I would suggest wxPython (wxWidgets) along with either Boa Constructor or Aptana Studio 3 (PyDev).  Python is a fantastic language for anyone to use (even children - see \"Snake Wrangling for Kids\"). By coding in Python/wxPython, you will be writing code that integrates beautifully with Linux but can be ported with trivial effort over to Windows and OS/X as well.  \n\nA: Use whatever you're most comfortable programming in. If you're going to be donating code (i.e. writing free software), you may as well enjoy it. As others have said, both languages are great for development.\n\nA: vala is probably number 3 (or 4 if you count gtkmm) of languages with good GTK bindings and documentation. it produces intermediate code in c, which you could alter or study to see how it's done, most of vala is just wrappers around GObject and GLib. Vala code runs nearly as fast as C, and should be easy from anyone coming from c/c#/java\n", "Q: What is the program that suggests installable packages?

You can install it by typing:\nsudo apt-get install nmap\n\nIs that a fancy feature of Bash? An extra daemon that hides in the background? How does it do that?\n\nA: Just as an addition to the previous answer:\nTo switch this off for your own account (without deinstalling the whole package and so disabling this for ALL users), you may just add the following line to your own ~/.bashrc:\nunset command_not_found_handle\n\nThis reverts to the default bevaviour of bash (see /etc/bash.bashrc for the definition of the function command_not_found_handle: it calls command-not-found if it is installed, otherwise it prints the default \"command not found\" error message).\n\nA: command-not-found is the package you are looking for.\n", "Q: How do I get embedded MIDI files to play in Chrome?

Since you have a dedicated partition that you want to use entirely for Ubuntu, it would make more sense to do a normal dual boot install directly on the 10GB partition. \nHowever, that doesn't answer your question... so here is how to resize the Wubi virtual disk:\nYou would need to do an \"inplace\" resize of the root.disk, which is possible if you boot an Ubuntu CD in live CD mode (Try without installing) and then use the following technique to resize. As mentioned in that post, you should backup the root.disk first (obviously to some place other than that 10GB volume).\nI also think you will not be able to use the full remaining 5GB - probably you should leave a little space remaining, but I'm not sure how much. \nPS the installation CD ISO Wubi used to install is hidden in the \\ubuntu\\install directory as .fuse_hidden000... and that takes 700MB so you could remove that to make some more space.\n", "Q: Is there some place to adjust preferences for unity other than CCSM?

I just want to know, if upgrading alter anything that I said earlier? \nI don't want to start over with a clean, fresh Natty, and I hope I can keep all of my files and folders and settings in Maverick, and to have them in Natty after the upgrade. Is this possible? Should I use Update Manager to achieve this? And would all my compiz-settings be reset after I upgrade? \nSorry for too much questions, but I'm asking this because you know, in Windows, any version upgrade would require the disk to be reformatted. I hope Ubuntu is more convenient than that. \n\nA: Ubuntu distribution upgrades are designed to be done over existing installations, and the process should go fairly smoothly, thanks to the wonders of package management. Files not associated with a package will be left alone, such as the contents of /home, html files you added to /var/www, applications you've installed from tarballs rather than from repositories or .deb packages, and so forth.\nPackages should only be removed if they were originally installed as dependencies of other packages, or if they conflict with newly installed packages. Changing default applications -- the change from Rhythmbox to Banshee as the default music application, for instance -- will lead to the installation of the new default application, but not the removal of the old default. Packages that were in the older distribution's repositories, but not in the newer distribution's repositories, will be left in place -- synaptic will list them under the category \"Obsolete or Local\".\nThe trickiest thing to watch out for is changes in configuration files -- if you've changed any configuration files associated with packages, you'll likely be prompted about how to resolve any conflicts during the upgrade.\nThe way package managers handle configuration files is to make a three-way comparison between the previous default config file, the new default config file, and the existing config file. If all three are identical, obviously, nothing happens. If the old default is identical to the new default, but the existing config file is different, the existing config file is left as is, because the rules apparently haven't changed so your choices are still valid. If the existing config is identical to the old default, but the new default is different, the new default will be installed, as you're apparently happy with the decisions the developers made about the defaults. The problematic case is when all three files are different -- you'll need to look carefully at the differences between your existing config file and the new default.\n\nA: dist-upgrade from one release to another can lose some settings.  files should still be there and installed applications should stay more or less the same(some may not be available in natty or have versioning issues).  if you custom compiled anything, that will probably need to be done again.  \nit is more convenient than windows, but there is still plenty of room for issues.  \nyou probably didn't get an answer due to the \"will it go perfectly\" phenomena.  the simple answer is \"no way to know\".  most everything will be preserved, but no one wants to say it will work 100% because murphy's law is always lurking.  add to that the applet oddity that's been going around and you wind up with \"it is a different OS/gui so something will probably change, but probably nothing earth shattering\"  \nfull disk image backup in case you need to revert before you try it out is my recommendation.  \n", "Q: Evince print to pdf file fails to print This is my problem: \n\n\n*\n\n*Open a document in Evince, choose Print\n\n*Choose \"Printer\": \"Print to file\"\n\n*Choose \"Output Format\": \"PDF\"\n\n*(add a filename output.pdf in the box if not there)\n\n*Click on \"Print\"\n\n*Experience the following message:\n\n\n...\nFailed to print document.\nPrinting is not supported on this printer.\n\nBy the way, printing to an \"Output Format\" .ps file works fine. \nWhat am I missing? \n\nA: Not by any means a satisfactory answer, but I can reproduce this problem exactly so I opened a bug for it,\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/evince/+bug/784228\nYou might want to subscribe to it.\n\nA: probably not the best answer, but one workaround might be to process it in gimp batch mode.  it supports importing postscript and exporting pdf(it will just be a page sized image with no character notation though).  just one possible workaround.\n", "Q: How do I upgrade from 10.04 to 10.10 in one command by using the terminal? \nPossible Duplicate:\nUpgrading from the command line? \n\nHi,\nI dont want to use the update manager I just want to type one command in a terminal do you understand?\nI am at 10.04 and want to upgrade to 10.10 (and on the 29 of april 11.04) in a terminal, can it be done?\n$ sudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n[sudo] password for alvar: \nReading package lists...

You can choose to scale all windows from the active desktop, or all windows [from any desktop].  I prefer to scale all windows.  This is better for users who do not use multiple desktops or use them infrequently.  It allows you the additional advantage of selecting which app you want to work with at the same time as moving directly to the relevant workspace if it's on a different one.\nThis is similar to the behavior of the Gnome Shell.  I have been using Gnome Shell for about half a year prior to just now switching to Unity.  It took me a bit to get used to Gnome Shell's task switching paradigm but once I did I loved it and would have gone back if I weren't able to achieve the functionality that I state in the paragraph above.\n\nA: Unity-2D\nI really recommend setting the Launcher to be always shown How do I configure Unity 2D? Soon you'll stop missing those millimeters and start appreciate better productivity. A delay to reveal the launcher is understandable but to have actual animations of the Launcher showing up and hiding back again is a misunderstanding productivity wise. I'd say that between the default configuration with animations and the always visible Launcher the latter is more optimal.\n\nA: This is how it works. There is experimental tab in Unity Compiz plugin.\nCheck with the values in the screenshot. And change the launcher reveal pressure. Optimal value for this is 7. A value of 1 will make the launcher popup faster but it may interrupt our actions.\n", "Q: Nvidia driver activated but currently not in use I have just finished an install of ubuntu 11.04 beta 2.

You can't use it as long as the old driver is still loaded in the kernel.\n\nA: Proprietary drivers in Ubuntu are drivers for your hardware devices that are not freely-available or open source, and must be obtained from the hardware manufacturer. The free and open source video driver, Nouveau, is the driver Ubuntu will use as the default for Nvidia graphics cards. Nouveau does not have support for 3D and may not work at all with latest video cards from Nvidia. Proprietary drivers, closed source, are the alternative for Nouveau, and most time provide superb 3D acceleration and overall video card support/performance. Follow these instructions to install proprietary drivers for your Nvidia Graphics Card. \n\n\nA: I had this same issue, but none of the answers here fixed it for me. I eventually fixed it by doing this:\nsudo modprobe nvidia\n\nWhich gave me a warning that nvidia_319 was actually blacklisted somehow...? So I did:\n$ cd /etc/modprobe.d\n$ sudo fgrep nvidia * | fgrep blacklist\n\nwhich informed me that my earlier install of bumblebee was breaking the regular nvidia drivers. So I did:\n$ sudo apt-get remove bumblebee\n$ sudo rm bumblebee.conf\n\nAnd that fixed the problem. If you have this problem, it may not be this exact issue with bumbleebee, but if your nvidia drivers are somehow blacklisted, this method will tell you what is blacklisting them and why, and you can attempt to deal with it that way. The \"Additional Drivers\" menu and jockey-text -l will not inform you that this could be a blacklist problem.\n\nIf the above or any of the other answers do not help, make sure that nouveau is blacklisted and then reinstall the nvidia drivers. Installing nvidia should do this for you, by making a file something like this (but if it doesn't, copy this one and make sure to blacklist all the drivers but the one you don't want to use)\n/etc/modprobe.d/nvidia-graphics-drivers.conf:\nblacklist nouveau\nblacklist lbm-nouveau\nblacklist nvidia-173\nblacklist nvidia-96\nalias nvidia nvidia-current \n\n\nA: You can check unity-2d as it will be the fallback environment from 11.10.

I think there are a lot of issues regarding newer Nvidia and Ubuntu\n\nA: I think you have the nvidia driver installed as a deb package but not the driver itself so you need the kernel headers for that i think \nfrom the terminal\nsudo apt-get install linux-headers-2.6.38-8-generic-pae\nsudo apt-get install linux-image-2.6.38-8-generic-pae\n\nor just look for them in synaptic\n", "Q: Using indicator-appmenu in maximized mode only I like the mac like global-menu or appmenu whatever you call it.

I'm hoping it will be implemented as an option soon.\nIn the mean time, removing 'indicator-appmenu' with 'sudo apt-get remove indicator-appmenu' will stop the menu moving to the top bar on all windows. If you have your focus to follow your mouse as I do, this is an essential change (as otherwise you can't reach your menu options). In fact, it's a pretty nasty bug for non-click focus users.\nIMO, it would be best for there to be an option to only put the menu in the top bar when maximised, as it makes the most sense (and best use of display space) then.\n", "Q: used space in a new empty partition I've created an extended partition (ext4) on one of my hard-disks. here is what it looks like:\nFilesystem             Size   Used  Avail Use% Mounted on\n\n/dev/sdc5              158G   5,9G   144G   4% /media/YAHSI\n\nwhy on earth there am i losing 8,1 GB space? when you add used & avail you don't get the size.\n\nA: They are reserved for root and privileged processes. Run sudo tune2fs -m 0 /dev/sdc5 to free them up for regular users.\nFrom the man page:\n\nReserving some number  of  filesystem\n                blocks for use by privileged processes is done to avoid\n  filesystem fragmentation, and to allow system  daemons,  such  as \n  syslogd(8),  to continue to function correctly after\n  non-privileged\n                processes are prevented from writing to  the  filesystem.\n  Normally, the default percentage of reserved blocks is 5%.\n\nIf you are just using the partition for extra storage, you don't need the reserved space.\n", "Q: Can APC ups wake powered off machine up when AC power is back? I have used apcupsd under ubuntu to power off my machine when AC power is lost via serial. \nIs there any way let the UPS to wake up already powered off machine when AC power is back?\nI have tried to enabled everything in BIOS that corresponding to wake up by ring, still no luck.\n\nA: This should be a standard feature of BIOS, and handled easily by apcupsd.\nYou are looking in BIOS for power-auto-return, power-return, OR after-power-loss.  This can be enabled, disabled, or (for more recent BIOS) last-state.  The 'last-state' option means: did you manually leave the machine on OR off, using the power switch.\nI have used an APC UPS, with apcupsd and USB connection, to do precisely what you are trying to do.\nThe UPS givith and the UPS taketh away. (but in reverse):\nWhen the UPS is low on battery, it halts power to the machine.  When it again has mains-power, it returns power to the machine.  From the machines viewpoint, the power was removed and restored, BUT outside its control.  It should just follow the BIOS setting for: 'after power loss\".\n\nA: You could also probably use a Raspberry Pi not connected to UPS which wakes the server via WoL or IPMI when power comes back and RPi boots.\n\nA: I apologize for what may be a complex answer.\nI think the issue would be that the computer is receiving power from the UPS until it runs out of battery... thus when power comes back on there is no 'change in state'. If the UPS were to have run out of power I believe the server settings for automatically power on would work. If you have a way to send a magic packet then wake on lan might work.\nsee link: http://www.linksysinfo.org/forums/showthread.php?t=65772\n\nA: I had a similar issue and I resolved it by connecting a Wifi AP with DD-WRT directly to mains. \nIn a situation where there is power loss and the server shuts down, but the power return so the server does not see the change in mains state the starting up Wifi AP sends a few WOL (wake-on-lan) packets throughout 5 minutes to make sure the packet will be received (in case the server is still shutting down, while power already returned).\nThe second scenario when power return after the UPS has run out of batteries just requires a BIOS setting to power on after power loss.\n", "Q: Is there an Ubuntu One client for Kubuntu?

I use Ubuntu 10.04.\nEver since I updated gstreamer, Movie Player doesn't work properly anymore and neither does Rhythmbox.\nHow can I keep using the previous version of gstreamer that worked?\n\nA: To downgrade a package go to Synaptic Package Manager. Find which package you want to downgrade. Select it. Then in the menu, go to Package -> Force Version...\nThen you would be able to select which version.\nYou can also do it in cli, for example:\nsudo apt-cache showpkg gstreamer0.10-pulseaudio\nIt will show the depencies and after Provides will show the versions:\n0.10.21-1ubuntu3 - gstreamer0.10-audiosource gstreamer0.10-audiosink \n0.10.21-1ubuntu2 - gstreamer0.10-audiosource gstreamer0.10-audiosink \nThen you can downgrade:\nsudo apt-get install gstreamer0.10-pulseaudio=0.10.21-1ubuntu2\n\nA: Works on Lubuntu 18.04 LTS with this:\n\nsudo apt-get install gstreamer0.10-qapt=3.0.4-0ubuntu1\n\n", "Q: How to make firefox main windows have no decorations using devilspie? First off, I can't run Compiz. It doesn't work with my old ati.\nI'm trying to make all firefox main windows have no decorations.\nHere's the rule:\n( if \n( and \n( is ( application_name ) \"Firefox\" )\n( contains ( window_name ) \"- Mozilla Firefox\" )\n) \n( begin \n( println \"match\" )\n( undecorate )\n)\n)\n\nIt will undecorate any open firefox window. As long as one firefox window is open, it will undecorate any new windows. If I close FF and reopen, it is not undecorated.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: (This was tested on Xubuntu 12.04, Xfce 4.10, with xfwm4 as the window manager.)\nIt is definitely possible to have existing firefox windows and newly opened ones automatically undecorated if you are using the latest version of devilspie, version 0.22. This is in the repositories and available to install with:\nsudo apt-get install devilspie\n\nThere is also a gui called gdevilspie, but the rules it produced seemed inaccurate and often didn't quite work, so it is easiest to concoct a rule by reading the readme and the manpage. \nHow the rule was created\nAll rules created must go in ~/.devilspie, and have a .ds extension, so firstly create the folder if it doesn't exist with\nmkdir ~/.devilspie\n\nIf you want to experiment to find the best window matching condition (class,name,etc), you can create a new file in ~/.devilspie called test.ds and place in it (debug) . Now you can enter devilspie & and then for every program that you launch, devilspie will examine and provide some window information in the terminal:\nWindow Title: 'Mozilla Firefox'; Application Name: 'Firefox'; Class: 'Firefox'; Geometry: 1280x970+0+27\n\nIn this case, it is best to select Class (window_class), as that will reliably identify the window.\nThe rule \nCreate a new file called firefox.ds in ~/.devilspie and place in it:\n; firefox rule to undecorate all existing and new windows     \n\n(if (is (window_class) \"Firefox\") (undecorate))\n\nComments are introduced with ; and are not read. You do not need to use begin in the command unless you are specifying multiple actions, such as (begin undecorate (set_workspace  2))) instead of just the single action (undecorate)).\nHowever, for devilspie to read the new rule you must restart it, so run\nkillall devilspie \n\nand then restart it with\ndevilspie & \n\nYou have to do this every time when you edit a rule or add a new one in ~/.devilspie, otherwise the changes or any new rules will not be read.\nIt is also very important that you add it to startup applications using your desktop environment's menus.\nFor more information on other possibilities with devilspie, see man devilspie or the Ubuntu manpages online.\n", "Q: Guake terminal showing up wrong in Unity It seems Guake terminal is not aware of the Unity sidebar being hidden. Even when the sidebar is hidden, it still shows with a left offset that is based on the width of the sidebar.\nAdditionally, the width of the terminal is not decreased by the width of the left offset, which causes the terminal to appear on my second monitor as well.\nIs there a way to fix this?\n\n\nA: I had another problem. The first few lines of guake were hidden by the Unity top panel. This can be solved changing the variable \"window_rect.y\" in line 835 (Natty) from 0 to 30, as shown below.\nwindow_rect.y = 30\n\nA: In 12.04, default configuration with side bar always shown, the problem with guake is that the right side of the terminal output is hidden. It seems that is not aware of the real visible size available. \nUsing Alin Andrei suggestion with\nwidth = 95\nI was able to fix it.\n\nA: I have a better workaround, or rather, a fix.\nOpen /usr/lib/guake/guake.py and scroll to line 786 containing:\nself.window.move(window_rect.x, window_rect.y)\n\nMove it under this line, no 788:\nself.window.show_all()\n\nAll works as expected after a restart of Guake - at least for me up to now.\n\nA: As a work-around, you can adjust the Guake terminal width to less then 100% of the screen width.\n\n\n*\n\n*Make a backup of /usr/lib/guake/guake.py for Ubuntu 12.04 and for Ubuntu 12.10 and newer, backup /usr/bin/guake file.\n\n*Open a terminal and run the following command:\nFor Ubuntu 12.04:\nsudo -i\ngedit /usr/lib/guake/guake.py\nexit\n\nFor Ubuntu 12.10 (or newer) Guake versions, use the following command instead:\nsudo -i\ngedit /usr/bin/guake\nexit\n\n\n*Then scroll down to somewhere around line 780-820 which says width = 100 - this is how it looks like:\nscreen = self.window.get_screen()\nheight = self.client.get_int(KEY('/general/window_height'))\nwidth = 100\nhalignment = self.client.get_int(KEY('/general/window_halignment'))\n\nAnd modify the width value (percentage) to whatever you want. Save the file, restart Guake and that's it.\n\nReference: WepUp8 Article\n\nA: Yes, go and fix Guake's code! :)\nTo be more serious, we are working on the positioning and sizing issues.\n\nA: Guake 0.4.4 && Ubuntu 12.04\nEdit in file:\ngksu gedit /usr/bin/guake\n\nLine 826:\nwidth = VALUE\n\nSave file and restart Guake!\n\nA: I found a simple hack.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open guake.\n\n*Open all the workspaces (Super + S).\n\n*Drag guake terminal from one screen to another.\n\n*Open the desired screen.\n\n\nThis works for me always on Ubuntu 13.10.

I had multiple Ubuntu VM's installations, and the host is also Ubuntu 10.04 LTS. After I deleted the VM's, the space wasn't reallocated to the host.\nDo you know any solution?\n\nA: Deleting virtual hard disks with Virtual Box Manager\nFrom the VirtualBox Manager you can easily manage you virtual hard disk by selecting File -> Virtual Media Manager or by pressing Ctrl + D.\nThis will display a list of all virtual hard disks known to the Virtual Box Manager:\n\nVirtual hard disk that are attached to a virtual machine or that contain snapshots need to be released first.

In the worst scenario you still have Gnome2 (instead of the default Unity), so I guess you will experience no problem running your applications.\n\nA: Every application of yours that worked in 10.10 should work perfectly fine with 11.04 as well, as even GNOME 3 (which is dramatically different from GNOME 2.x both in looks and under-the-hood) has strong backward compatibility with classic GNOME apps.

An example would be ubuntu-devel from 2004 ordered by users.\n", "Q: How do I generate a file with suitable permissions using sprintf() & write()? #include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n#include <fcntl.h>\n#include <sys/stat.h>\n\n\nvoid main(){\n    char tmp[12]={0x0};\n    int i=13;\n    sprintf(tmp,\"%11d\", i);\n    int fd = open(\"transaction.txt\", O_CREAT | O_RDWR);\n    write(fd, tmp, sizeof(tmp));\n}\n\nI'm trying to write integers to a file.\nbecause linux does not offer itoa function, I have to try to use sprintf.\nbut I can't read the result file.   \nThe file created is owned by me but has permissions ------xr-x. This means that my user can't read or write the file and my group has no access at all but strangely other users can read it. \n\nThe file is readable if I run sudo cat transaction.txt which gives 13 as expected.\nHow can I generate a file with suitable permissions so that is is usable.\n\nA: Add the line\nint fd;\n\nand modify the open call as follows:\nfd = open(\"transaction.txt\", O_CREAT | O_WRONLY, 00644);\n\n", "Q: How to show icon Googsystray? I have upgrade my ubuntu from maverick to natty, and my problem is Googlesystray not show in panel. but the app is work. how to show icon notification in unity panel?\n\nA: If you know the command for it, install dconf-tools , then open dconf-editor (alt+f2 dconf-editor) add an exception to the whitelist. You can also replace the whitelist with \"all\" to allow all applications.\n\nYou need to run alt+f2 unity --replace afterwords.\n\nA: Try to whitelist Google Systray in the panel by running dconf or by running gsettings.\n", "Q: What's the best way to Natty Narwhal 11.04 upgrade? format and install from zero or upgrade my current 10.10 Ubuntu installation?\nif I upgrade my current Ubuntu, Is it possible that I will not have the same look and feel of a fresh installation?\n\nA: If you don't want your data to be erased, the best option is to update it via the Update Manager. \nIt will not be the same look since from version 11.04 Ubuntu ships with a new Desktop Interface 'Unity'. It will not look like the Gnome Desktop Environment, your current Ubuntu (10.10) have. \n\nA: It depends on personal preference, so in my case I would opt for a clean installation.  Always remember to backup your data so the transition is made just that bit smoother.\n", "Q: Installing a tar.bz2 I am trying to install laidout-0.0o91.tar.bz2. its a publishing program for Linux. can you please give me the right terminal instructions to install this on my system.\n\nA: Go to the folder you downloaded the laidout-0.0o91.tar.bz2 from the terminal and type,\ntar -jxvf laidout-0.0o91.tar.bz2\nthen type, cd laidout-0.0o91\nafterwards, less README\nyou will see the installation instructions in your terminal window. \n(by the way, if your processor is 64bit, there's a .deb installer to download. Just download that and then double click it to install.)\n\nA: If you have the 64bit version of ubuntu installed, there is a one-click-installer (.deb) for that version located at this link. All you need to do for that is download and double click the \"laidout_0.091_amd64.deb\" file.\n(If you're not sure if you have 64 bit Linux installed, open a terminal and type \"arch\". If you see \"x86_64\" you have 64 bit and can use the .deb package listed above.)\nIf you have 32bit Ubuntu, you have two options. The simple solution is to download the 32bit package, but it is only for version 0.09. If there is not a specific reason why you need 0.091, then download the one-click-installer package from here and run it just like I mentioned earlier (click the .deb file in your Downloads folder, and click \"install\" when prompted)\nIf there is a specific reason why you absolutely need that version AND you are using 32 bit ubuntu, than here is the second option, which involves building the package from source. The general directions are as follows, but may not work depending on the package.\nPrepare  your system to build from source\nsudo apt-get install build-essential checkinstall\n\nInstall from the .tar.bz2 you downloaded\ncd ~/Downloads\ntar -jxvf laidout-0.0o91.tar.bz2\ncd laidout-0.0o91\n./configure\nmake\nsudo checkinstall\n\nIf it complains at any step about missing packages, install them with\nsudo apt-get install <name-of-missing-package>\n\nAgain, only follow these steps if you have 32 bit Ubuntu and you cannot use version 0.09 instead of 0.091.\nBest of Luck!\n", "Q: What are the differences between the Ubuntu shipped kernel and the upstream kernel? What are the differences in feature set between the main Linux kernel and the kernel being used by Ubuntu?  Why is Ubuntu branched off of the main kernel instead of using the main kernel directly?\n\nA: The upstream kernels (referred, when we provide them, as mainline kernels) are simply the upstream kernel for the specified version, with a very few minor configuration changes added so that there is minimal issue using them on an Ubuntu Install. \nThe difference between these kernels and the one released for an Ubuntu version are numerous other configuration changes, source patches* and, in some cases, compiled in modules and hardware support.\nVery little of the underlying code is different from upstream other than that noted above.\n*: source patches are, in most cases, changes to the default behavior of the kernel. These are not limited to: blacklists, video quirks tables, built in modules, source changes that are not yet in Linus' tree or the stable queue quite yet etc.\nSource patches are what the team uses to introduce configuration options that are required to support the vast array of released software for a specific version of Ubuntu. In many cases they are necessary for those applications to work properly. The fundamental difference between this and the upstream kernel is that the pure upstream kernel is not distribution specific. \nTherefore, the configurations are not geared toward ensuring that certain applications work as expected. These configs exist to provide that level of changeability to the kernel for specific things. Additionally, the use of quirks allows us to identify hardware that requires specific things from the kernel that we can set once we detect them. \nThis is one of the major features of Linux and it is one of the reasons we have been able to run on so many diverse platforms over the years. There are times when the quirks and source patches cause issues between each other. During these times, we work to mitigate the problems with changes to underlying kernel behavior. In many cases these changes don't make it upstream until after the release due in very large part to the need to properly code the fix, document what was done, test the changes and conduct various other tests and stress testing. \nIn these cases, patches that are headed for upstream are carried as source patches in much the same way pre-stable and patches that are not yet in Linus' tree do. The link to the delta review spec should serve as a reference for what was reviewed for the current Natty release of the Ubuntu kernel.\n\nA: The Linux kernel is in constant development. When packaging their next release, at some point in time the Ubuntu team has to say, 'OK, we'll take the kernel as it now stands' From time to time you may get a new kernel made available in the repos to use in the current distribution.\nThis place can make for some interesting reading but it can be highly technical. You may be able to work out what's cooking upstream and what you're currently missing out on (but will eventually get).\nIt should be noted, like any piece of software, a kernel is prone to be bug-ridden and it's often the case that regressions occur (new stuff added breaks old functionality). Kernels these days IMHO don't really excite me in terms of new functionality. I'd quite happily run a kernel that was two years old for example.\n\nA: You can download the git tree of Ubuntu, and use a graphical viewer to view the git tree.  That will show you all the patches of Ubuntu.  https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/Dev/KernelGitGuide\nAnother possible option, subscribe to the ubuntu-kernel mailing list.  All their work is posted there, and you can get an idea of what they do.  But, it is high traffic, and IMHO, annoying. (But hey, it is their list)\n", "Q: Grub.

Also I have GRUB 1 and 2 installed which from my understanding of grub, I do not believe is a good idea. I followed the instructions from this forum to uninstall grub and GRUB2 and reinstall a fresh GRUB2. Problem I had next was that Windows would not boot... I would just get a blinking cursor. I used the Windows cd to boot into console and used the FIXBOOT command. I anticipated that this would wipe out GRUB, but it left GRUB intact and now I can boot both Windows and Lubuntu.   \n\nA: If you used GParted to partition the disk, the Windows system will have an error that needs chkdsk to repair. I did this with an XP disk. It doesn't matter what disk. I have Home Edition on my netbook and used an XP Pro disk to run a command prompt. At the prompt, type chkdsk c: /f /r. The options will locate bad sectors and repair them.\n", "Q: How to restore a single file from a package?

I'm running Maverick at the moment and the default music player is Rhythmbox. It interfaces with the panel through the sound menu, so you can see it playing like this:\n\nI know that, in Natty, Banshee is due to be the default music player, so I was trying it out the other day to get to grips with it. How can I change which music player interfaces with the panel like this (from Rhythmbox to Banshee and then back again)? Because, at the moment, when I run Banshee, I just get this:\n\n...and no Banshee integration.\n\nA: It doesn't matter which music player is default. When you install banshee or rhythmbox it should add itself to the sound menu. However you need to logout and then login again to see the changes in the sound menu.\nHowever just to make sure, click Edit -> Preferences -> Extensions and see if the sound menu extension is enabled. (See the screenshot below for more details)\n\n\nA: System Preference -> Preferred Applications -> Media Player. You can choose your preferred application there.\n\nA: Really has nothing to do with 'Default', you can have several players in the sound menu,they'd be listed top down in order of install/activating, in other words the order listed in com.canonical.indicators.sound - interested-media-players which can be adjusted as desired.\nAtm there are at least 3 specifically enabled - banshee, rhythmbox, clementine, additionally vlc-1.2+ has MPRIS2  support & works to some extent.\nFrom my perspective the 'quality' of sound menu support is best in banshee closely followed by clementine & rhythmbox. Banshee & clementine  seem to lack album art in the menu. (I not sure if guayadeque has or will have support \nVlc works ok, has album art but as it wasn't specifically coded for the sound menu it can't be minimised to it, only opened & controlled from it.\nThere is some interest possibly for audacious but nothing yet.\nUnless you or someone else is up to the task of adding MPRIS2 & then enabling as intended for the sound menu then yes, you are \"dependent on the developers of the music players..\" not only for MPRIS2 but also proper integration into the menu.\nscreen example - \n\n\nA: Have a look through dconf-editor at apps.indicators.sound. There are a couple of options there that might be relevant. I've switched my menu from Banshee to Rhythmbox. I did so by blacklisting banshee and adding rhythmbox to the list of interested media players.\nI hope that that will help you.\n\nA: I uninstalled Banshee and then installed Rhythmbox. Rhythmbox showed in Dash and in the sound indicator without any additional intervention from me that I recall. If you wish to keep multiple players around I suggest you open System Settings and select System Info. There you can adjust Default Applications. That's where I changed Firefox to Chrome after installing it and Chrome shows up in Dash as the default browser even though within Chrome I never designated it as my default browser.\n", "Q: Is my processor 64 or 32 bit?

What new features and changes will be done for Ubuntu 11.10?\n\nA: I think it is too early to talk about the features of Ubuntu 11.10 since the Ubuntu Developer Summit (UDS) for 11.10 has not taken place yet. You can find more info about UDS here. \nHowever one of the features that Mark Shuttleworth announced was the availability of Unity to all users regardless of their hardware. This essential means that Unity 2D would be the backup incase Unity 3D is not supported by your hardware.\n", "Q: What is the shortcut for closing all of the open directory windows in nautilus? How can I close all the open Nautilus windows in one swoop? I'm using 10.10 and 10.04.

I have trouble connecting to the Internet and I do not know what apps are available. I am quite frustrated!\nCan you give me information that will get me started to learn about Ubuntu?\n\nA: Here is a good introductory video tutorial to Ubuntu.  That youtube user has dozens of other tutorial videos as well.  He's using an older version of Ubuntu, but most of the basics are the same, assuming you aren't using the newest version (11.04), which releases in a couple days (April 28, 2011).  Version 11.04 uses the new Unity layout, which is pretty radically different, and much more akin to OS X.\nHere is the official documentation for Ubuntu.  It's much more in-depth (and maybe a little more work to wade through).  It will walk you through most of the basics.\nIn short, to get to places, you'll want to use the three menus in the upper-left of the screen, especially the \"Applications\" menu.  Under Applications > Internet you'll find firefox, which is the default web browser.  The Open Office programs will do the work you may be used to doing in MS Office (word processing, spreadsheets, etc.).  The last item in the Applications menu is the installer, where you can search for new programs and install them.\nIf you have a more specific problem than this, go ahead and edit your question (or ask a new one) and we'll be able to help further.\n\nA: There is a big community about Ubuntu on the Dell Mini,\nhttp://www.ubuntumini.com/\nYou can also join the community there.\n", "Q: I have a 32-bit machine, can I use programs that are meant for 64-bit processors? I am using a 32-bit machine, but I am having to use a relatively obscure semantic database which only comes in 64-bit versions.\nWhat are my options for running it in my local dev environment?\nCurrently when I try to run it, I get an error message that looks like this:\ncannot execute binary file\n\nand when I check my machine info, I get this:\n$ uname -a\nLinux slabrams-desktop 2.6.32-29-generic #58-Ubuntu SMP Fri Feb 11 19:00:09 UTC 2011 i686 GNU/Linux\n\n\nA: If its a compiled binary, in only a 64 bit version, I think you're stuck. The binary instructions within the 64 bit program won't be understood by your 32 bit processor. It might be possible somehow to run it through some kind of emulator but I've never seen one designed to do that, and it would most likely run very slow if there was one.\n\nA: In case your CPU supports hardware virtualization (most modern processors do) you are able to run a 64-bit guest virtual machine on a 32-bit host by using Virtual Box (see here for reference).\nHowever this may not be as stable as running on a native 64-bit OS. If you need to run 64-bit applications I would strongly recommend an upgrade of your system to an amd64 Ubuntu version.\n\nA: You can run 64bit application if you install a 64 bit kernel (which is possible while staying with 32 bit libs) and after that building a 64 bit chroot environment for the application. Well, a completely virtual solution may be easier, but if you need a direct hardware access this is an only way. \nYou may install 645 bit kernel as additional, and load it with kexec. \n", "Q: What is the lightest desktop interface for ubuntu and is Unity-2d classified as a 'light' interface? With the plethora of potential interfaces available\n\n\n*\n\n*lxde,\n\n*openbox,\n\n*fluxbox\n\n*xfce,\n\n*gnome2,\n\n*gnome3,\n\n*unity-3d,\n\n*unity-2d etc, \n\n\nmy question is - what is meant by \"the lightest desktop interface\" - and can you now consider Unity-2d as \"Light\"?\nAny guidance on the pro's and con's would be extremely useful for my evaluation - my target computer is a \n\n\n*\n\n*Pentium 4 1.3Ghz, 512Mb, 32GB HDD, 1024x768 Monitor, Geforce FX5500 256Mb AGP \n\n\nI would like to use it for web-browsing such as youtube, google-earth, simple graphical picture editing and word processing - all aimed for school student aged 10-15 yrs.\n\nA: Just to make this page more complete I would like to suggest Enlightenment as an option.\nIt is claimed for some to be the lightest Desktop Environment (DE), although it is a matter of opinion.  \nThere are distros based in this DE such as Bodhi Linux, but you can install it (click here) in any Ubuntu and then logout and before log back in choose Enlightenment.\n\nA: If you want everything to run smooth with those system specs, I would go with Xfce or Lxde. \nOpenbox and Fluxbox are simply Window Managers and while being extremely light weight there is a lot of configuring involved.\nI'm not saying Gnome or Unity (which is Gnome with Compiz) won't work. It just might not be that quick and snappy. \n\nA: Given your configuration I would suggest XFCE, it is pretty good and very similar to GNOME 2 but light on resources.\n\nA: I can tell you I've tried it all end always end up with Lubuntu. I recently purchased a brand new netbook with latest Atom CPU and ION2 (GPU) and on Unity/Ubuntu 11.04 it was like swimming with clothes on. Even when running Unity-2d. I reverted to Lubuntu and it was a totally different experience, everything snappy and smooth. Mem usage down from ca 600MB idle 200MB!!!!\nThen I've found out Openbox is undervalued it is indeed very powerful and robust if you have some time to read the guides and make your own customization. You could skip the LX desktop altogether, running without panel & launcher if you like and then you would have even more resources available. But it takes time and your gain is not as much as by just installing clean Lubuntu/LXDE from Ubuntu.\nHate to say it but Ubuntu is getting bulky like an elephant. Unity is nice but man it does eat your resources, a little easier with memory than the Win7 installation I had preconfigured but not any much faster (webbrowsing, watching video, loading apps etc...)\n\nA: A light interface is basically one that uses little resources, and can optionally depend on compositing and/or 3D capabilities, so even compiz could be called a light desktop interface when configured correctly (I've run compiz on worse specs than those you mentioned and it was fast and pretty stable).\nFor optimum performance, I would suggest going with Lxde (Lubuntu).\nYou can also use GNOME or XFCE, but keep in mind that both may get stressed under a heavy work load with that little memory, though you should be safe either way if you are only doing the basics like web browsing, word processing, etc.\nUnity 2D is also a light interface, and might be able to run on your hardware.\n\nA: In my opinion the best available windows manager is ICEWM. It is simple, stable and you can make it any thing. \nPS: while using it you may get a feel of using a stone age windows manager (windows 95 etc.) but its worth it. You can configure it too look like windows 7 as well :)\n", "Q: Upgraded with some problems. What happened to my panel? The panels just disappeared my panel is gone in my updated version of ubuntu.

Need a fix here.\nHere's another picture of my problem:\n\n\nA: Sounds very similar to that bug some people are unfortunately experiencing:\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/unity/+bug/745996\nAs you can see, it's set to critical and tracked to be fixed in a Stable Release Update during the cycle. However, we have small hints at this stage about what causes it.\nAll additional information on the bug report it always appreciated :)\nIt seems that for some people this helped:\n1. remove this file from your filesystem: ~/.drirc\n2. logout and login again\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I subscribe to a bug?\n\nA: Try logging out and selecting 'Ubuntu Classic' or 'Ubuntu Classic (no effects)' after clicking on your username. Also give Unity 2D a try as it's pretty close to unity.\n\nA: try to logout (ctrl+alt+del). log in in classic mode. go to ccsm and enable the unity plugin. then logout again, and log in in unity. hope this helps\n\nA: Maybe you can try these commands:\n1. reset the gnome panel\ngconftool –recursive-unset /apps/panel\n\n2. remove all the config files\nrm -rf ~/.gconf/apps/panel\n\n3. kill and restart the gnome panel\nkillall gnome-panel\n\n\nA: This is often called by a drawing error inside of your driver. Either FBO support is failing or shader support is failing. Please make sure your mesa and xorg drivers are up to date.\n\nA: Try these:\n\n\n*\n\n*Log into classic mode.\n\n*Create a desktop Shortcut for CCSM\n\n*Now log into Unity. Click on CCSM Desktop Shortcut. Enable Unity plugin if it is not enabled.\n\n*Go to preferences, and reset Unity profile to defaults. Logout or Restart your system, log into unity. You should have your panel back now.\n\n\nAddition Step --> If the problem does not get solved, you may have to use this step as an additional step at number 3 in above list.\nLaunch CCSM in classic desktop mode, under preferences, under profile click on reset to defaults. With this you  may loose any customization you have done so far. Keep that in mind.\n", "Q: Graphics very jerky on Natty Narwal I just got a new laptop, and installed narwal on it.

As user4124 suggested in the comment below, the best option is to find it through the Software Center. Plus it's very easy that way.\n\nA: I assume that you downloaded the source of The Battle for Wesnoth and you prefer it to the already packaged versions for Ubuntu. The source needs to be compiled to create executables, so you need to compile it before you can install it. To compile and install it you can follow these instructions which are copied here for convenience:\n\nCompiling\nIf you choose to build Wesnoth from source you should add the datadir\n  flag to configure to ensure your installation puts the data in the\n  same place as the official installation path:\ncd /usr/src\ntar -xvjf wesnoth-1.x.x.tar.bz2\ncd wesnoth-1.x.x\n./configure --datadir=/usr/share/games ...\nmake\nsudo make install\n\n\nSee http://wiki.wesnoth.org/CompilingWesnoth for more information.\n", "Q: How to stop wifi disconnection when eth0 link becomes ready?

Which is extremely annoying as I can't surf as along as I'm connected via (cable) ethernet.\nOr generally speaking: As long as I'm connected with a network from the \"wired\" tab.\nI already checked \"Available to all users\" for my WLAN and Wired network so that they are available when I log in. But this doesn't affect the problem mentioned above.\nDo I need to get rid of the NetworkManager to be able to stay connected to my WLAN and Wired network at the same time?\n(They don't share the same network address pool. WLAN is static IP, Wired is DHCP with differenct IP network.)\n\nA: You'll want to go in the connection's configuration settings, under the IPv4 Settings tab, click the Routes button, and check the checkbox marked \"Use this connection only for the resouces on its network\".\nWhat this does is tell NetworkManager to not use that connection as a default route. However, you'll need to edit it again to remove that option if you want to use wired as a connection for the internet (or create a separate connection just for changing old wifi settings).\n\n", "Q: Upgrade from 10.04 to 10.10 lost MBR I think I've lost my MBR upgrading from ubuntu 10.04 to 10.10.\nDuring the upgrade it gave me a message saying which partitions did I want the grub details to go on, saying if I was unsure to select all of them.\nAfter reboot I just end up in a grub recovery console.\nThe system was a dual boot with windows vista.\nAny Idea how I can get both my operating systems to work?\nI'm currently attempting to download a live cd of 10.10 but its a rather big download to fix what I assume is a small problem.

This thread, this thread and this thread might be useful to you. Look for the section explaining how to re-install GRUB2 in the first thread. (Also LiveCD is useful when you want to recover data.)\n\nA: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1639198 by following the instructions on that page I was able to install lilo.\nLilo gives me two options ubuntu and windows. Windows works directly, choosing ubuntu brings me to grub which allows me to boot ubuntu.\nYes grub gives a warning about an invalid background colour but at least my machine is usable (or as usable as it was before.).\n\nA: I never got in trouble by using these instructions:\nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/Grub2#Recover \nFirst of all, you must start your system from a live cd.

Please note that the Live CD must be the same as the system you are fixing - either 32-bit or 64-bit (if not then the chroot will fail).\n2) Open a terminal (Applications > Accessories > Terminal).  \n3) Determine your normal system partition - (the switch is a lowercase \"L\")\n\nsudo fdisk -l\n\nIf you aren't sure, run  \ndf -Th  \n\nLook for the correct disk size and ext3 or ext4 format.  \n4) Mount your normal system partition:\nSubstitute the correct partition: sda1, sdb5, etc.  \nsudo mount /dev/sdXX /mnt  \n\nExample: sudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt \n5) Only if you have a separate boot partition:\nsdYY is the /boot partition designation (for example sdb3)\nsudo mount /dev/sdYY /mnt/boot \n6)\nMount the critical virtual filesystems:\nsudo mount --bind /dev  /mnt/dev\nsudo mount --bind /dev/pts  /mnt/dev/pts\nsudo mount --bind /proc /mnt/proc\nsudo mount --bind /sys  /mnt/sys \n7)\nChroot into your normal system device:\nsudo chroot /mnt \n8) If there is no /boot/grub/grub.cfg or it's not correct, create one using\nupdate-grub \n9)\nReinstall GRUB 2:\nSubstitute the correct device - sda, sdb, etc. Do not specify a partition number.\ngrub-install /dev/sdX \n10) Verify the install (use the correct device, for example sda.

Really.  But I'm wondering about viruses.  I come from a mac background (I have never got a virus) and I'm wondering how ubuntu does the same.  It has \"millions of users\" so I'm wondering why someone didn't make one yet.  Or does it have built-in protection?\n\nA: Speaking of all the security issues in general, but leaving out the viruses, Ubuntu has build-in security.\nHowever, Ubuntu will not stop you from installing malware like the Windows anti-viruses try to do. For example, if someone tricks you into installing software that will spy, spam, or destroy all your data then you're out of luck.\nMany more security mechanisms are available if you choose to set them up: firewall rules, anti-virus scanners, network monitoring, two-factor authentication, etc... These additional mechanisms are mostly intended for servers and you should not need to worry about them as a desktop user.\nHaving that said, there are many vulnerabilities and Linux systems get broken into every day all over the world. Security teams come-out with updates to fix these vulnerabilities regularly. Ubuntu has it's own security team that releases updates and advices for systems administrators.\nHere is an overview about anti-Viruses and Ubuntu security.\nIn practice Ubuntu is much safer than Windows. In terms of exposure to malware, Ubuntu is comparable to Mac. But as @Giacomo pointed out, living in a nearly virus free world can leave Mac users naive.\nThe top 2 things that you can do to stay extra safe:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install software only from the official repository\n\n*Keep your software up by letting the Update Manager do it's thing\n\n\nA: In no modern Operating System viruses are an issue for the sensible user. So viruses are an issue if you're not sensible.\nViruses in fact don't get harmful unless you actually run them. That's almost the same in every different O.S., and do mistrust people telling you \"Linux is good because Windows has got viruses\" because it's nonsense. Linux (and Ubuntu) is good for many reasons, but this has nothing to do with viruses.\nHowever, running Ubuntu or Linux in general lets you be statistically less prone to get infected by viruses. Ubuntu encourages users to choose official repositories as the main source of software (which are safe), and running an executable by double-click is less easy than in Windows.\nBut you can still get into a website that asks you to add a poisoning repository, or to install a malicious .deb (with double-click) to add some awesome functionality Ubuntu is missing.\nSo viruses are a problem because of the user, not because of the system (which in most cases is an innocent victim), even if in some old Windows systems (95, 98, ME but also old versions of XP) one could get a virus without doing anything unsafe, just through some vulnerability of the system. But leaving out pointless chat topics (Micro$oft is baaad, etc...) nowadays Windows systems are safe enough for the use cases they're intended and do get infected because of user inexperience and IT unknowing.\nSo, to answer your question:\n\n\n*\n\n*Windows users are usually less competent users and get infected with ease\n\n*Ubuntu users use repositories which are safe\n\n\nIn no way Ubuntu is stronger towards viruses, I can write one tomorrow, pack it in a .deb, and it would be insidious and destructive also because people think \"linux has no viruses\". Linux has no viruses until you create one, which can be done in minutes, assuming you can convince the victim that it is safe to execute it.\n\nA: There do exist \"viruses\" for Linux. Or rather, software that runs on your Linux computer without your consent (presumably for a malicious purpose). An example is a script disguised to look like a common command which serves as an IRC spam bot (this happened to a friend of mine -- the attacker gained access via SSH by guessing a user's password due to my friend's carelessness).\nWith that said, to actually get a virus on Linux is difficult. What I mean by that is that a typical user will most probably only ever get a virus if he or she executes a malicious script (don't run scripts you're not familiar with) or sets weak passwords that are easily cracked via SSH or otherwise. This is because a user in Ubuntu has limited privileges. \nThe best way to combat viruses and attacks (like the above-mentioned SSH attack) is to implement some basic security measures like restricting SSH access to your machine to certain domains (or not having SSH run at all), choosing a good password, and being careful.\n", "Q: Why doesn' t wireshark work? I installed wireshark.  Ran it.  When I click on 'Interface List', I get a list of 0 interfaces.  I think that means I have some kind of configuration problem.  \nI'm guessing my kernel isn't configured for it?  How do I fix that?  I'm hoping there is an easier solution than manually recompiling the kernel.\n\nA: You need to run wireshark as root. I'm not sure whether the launcher is set to do this yet but try plugging this into a terminal:\ngksu wireshark\n\nTo make life easier on yourself, I suggest you edit the launcher (right click the menu → click edit menus → find wireshark and change prepend its command with gksu).\n\nAlternatively, you can use setcap to allow non-root users to use dumpcap (the application that does all the capturing that WireShark uses):\nsudo setcap 'CAP_NET_RAW+eip CAP_NET_ADMIN+eip' /usr/bin/dumpcap\n\nThis is essentially from the WireShark Wiki. I had seen this before I posted the above but I wasn't confident in it. After seeing it again in the comments, I gave it a test today and it appears to work.\nThis has a security issue too, though...\nAny user or process on the system can now monitor network traffic without user intervention. Think exploited service or genuine user. The wiki does have another setting where you can limit dumpcap to one group of users (and you add your account to that group) but this is only marginally better. What happens if your browser has an exploitable flaw, that allows somebody to fire off commands (does occasionally happen)?\nIn my eyes this is more of a security risk than going through gksu. At least that way you need to enter a password.\n\nA: The following way will limit capturing packets to a specific user(s) and not run wireshark as root. \nFirst, run sudo dpkg-reconfigure wireshark-common. Select 'yes' when asked. This will make a wireshark group whose members are allowed to capture packets.\nSecond, run sudo usermod -a -G wireshark <yourloginname> This will add you to the wireshark group.\nThird, log out and then back in. This will apply the group changes.\nNow you should be able to run wireshark as your user and have it allow you to capture packets. If you want to add additional users, just repeat steps 2 and 3 for the additional users.\nFrom reading the wireshark wiki, this method sounds like the most recommended way to do it.\n", "Q: Can new kernel be deleted? i upgrade from lucid to maverick and got pretty messy  i reinstall ubuntu maverick from live cd and so far i just had to reinstall all applications i had.\nbut i have this list of kernel\nlinux-image-2.6.35-22-generic        2.6.35-22.35\nlinux-image-2.6.35-28-generic        2.6.35-28.50\nlinux-image-generic                  2.6.35.28.36  \nand im using currently this version\nLinux 2.6.35-22-generic i686\nim not sure if it's safe to delete the new kernel.\n\nA: Some times new kernel can result in some driver incompatibilities, so it is safe to roll back to older version until the matter is resolved.\nYou can simply chose old version of kernel(or make it default).

Did you install a separate zookeeper package and start it?\nIf so, you'll need to tell HBase not to start zookeeper automatically.  Edit the conf/hbase-env.sh file and add the line:\nexport HBASE_MANAGES_ZK=false\n\nOn the other hand, if you want HBase to start zookeeper automatically, then change that setting to \"true\", make sure any current zookeeper process is stopped and try again.\nFYI, if you run into more problems, subscribe to the HBase user mailing list at user-subscribe@hbase.apache.org and we can help you further there.\n", "Q: Ubuntu One: can this be used for backups? Just setup a laptop with Ubuntu 10.10 and noticed that Ubuntu's offering a free cloud-based sync service with 2GB of storage.  What protocols/methods does Ubuntu One support for connectivity?  i.e. can I mount it as a block-device like Elastic Block Storage?  SSH?  More interested in using it for Ubuntu Server as a cheap off-site backup solution for Webservers, etc.\n\nA: Ubuntu One is not a backup service, and I wouldn't recommend you using it for this.\nHaving said that, some people—some Ubuntu One hackers, in fact—do use it for this, but you have to know the limitations of the service in this regard (and I'm not going to explain them here).\nFurthermore, you should be aware that dejà dup is going to be implementing “back up to Ubuntu One”, using our service as the basis for a backup system and not as a backup system per se. This I fully support.\n\nA: Technically, Yes.  However, as of the last time I used UbuntuOne, it was not encrypted, so I'd say no, to using it as a backup service.  Also, most backup utilities run as a cron job, with elevated privledges.  As such, the backup files are owned by root, which does not play nicely with the user type folders that UbuntuOne creates.\n\nA: Definitely yes. The backup utility on Ubuntu (called \"backup\", but its real name is Déjà Dup) lets you store the backup to Ubuntu One. So even if you delete a file accidentaly, and the deletion is synced to U1, you will be able to restore the latest backup using the \"backup\" app.\nYou don't even need to open the app. Just right click on the file or folder you want to restore, and it will suggest \"reverting\" it.\n", "Q: When will deb multi arch support be included in Ubuntu?

In Maverick, there was an option to download Flash videos from sites like YouTube, Vimeo, etc. by copying the flashxx** file in /tmp directory to another location before closing the window. But in Firefox 4 in Natty, this doesn't work anymore. Why?\n\nA: If you navigate to your /proc folder, you will see a bunch of folders all named numerically, including a folder which matches the number in the second field.\nNow navigate to this folder, then its subfolder “fd”. In this folder, you will see a whole selection of numbers. These relate to the file descriptors themselves.\nRun ls -l in this folder, and you will see that each of these numbers is linked to either pipes, sockets or files.\nWithin this, the number from the fourth field will be symbolic linked to the /tmp/Flash* file we found before.\nTo test that this is the right file, you can run it through mplayer or vlc (mplayer filedescriptornumber/vlc filedescriptornumber).\nIf you’re having trouble finding the filename, try ls -l | grep Flash.\nFor easy way try this command in console:\nstat -c %N /proc/*/fd/* 2>&1|awk -F[\\`\\'] '/Flash/{print$2}'\n\nThe output will be something like this:\n/proc/4691/fd/17\n/proc/4691/fd/18\n\nThat will list all your downloaded flash streams. For that example, there are 2 flash videos from my firefox 4 browser. If you want to copy it, simply use this command:\ncp /proc/4691/fd/17 ~/Videos/Flash/sample.flv\n\nSource: http://n00bsys0p.wordpress.com/2011/02/10/how-to-download-flash-10-2-video-streams-in-linux/\n\nA: This little script would save your downloaded flash files to a custom directory.\n\n\n*\n\n*make the directory of where you want the files to be saved eg ~/Videos/flvs\nmkdir ~/Videos/flvs\n\n\n*open gedit and copy and paste this script.\n#!/bin/bash\n# flvcache script\n\nCACHE=~/.mozilla/firefox/*.default/Cache\nOUTPUTDIR=~/Videos/flvs\nMINFILESIZE=2M\n\nfor f in `find $CACHE -size +$MINFILESIZE`\ndo\n    cp \"$f\" \"$OUTPUTDIR/$o\"\ndone\n\nnautilus  \"$OUTPUTDIR\"&\n\n\n*save the file as saveflashall.sh, then add executable permissions to the file\nchmod +x saveflashall.sh\n\n\n*then run it.\n./saveflashall.sh\n\nit would then open the files in the first folder created above.

Move it to the location you want to save videos. Right-click on the file, go to Properties, Change the Permissions to \"Allow executing as a program\".\nAll you have to do is click the script, select \"Run in Terminal\", and it will save all video files to that directory. To save the whole video, it has to be finished loading in your browser. It will save videos from almost any website, including youtube, vimeo, dailymotion, metacafe, liveleak, facebook. Just delete any video files you don't want.\n(If a video you want is not getting saved, then the website is probably using a proprietary stream format that can't be saved by any cache retrieving program. Examples: Hulu, netflix, some youtube videos?) Also, VLC player is a great for watching flash videos.\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\n# getvids.sh [save_folder]\n\nSAVE_FOLDER=\"$HOME\" # User editable\n\n# If the below option is used, then this script should be run in a terminal.\n#CPMOD=\"-i\" # Uncomment to prevent file overwrites\n\nPATERN=\"libflashplayer\"\nALL_PID=`pgrep -f $PATERN`\n\nif [ $? -eq 1 ]; then\n  echo ERROR: Flashplayer not running\n  exit 1\nfi\n\nif [ ! -z $1 ]; then\n  echo \"Setting save location: $1\"\n  SAVE_FOLDER=\"$1\"\nfi\n\nif [ ! -d \"$SAVE_FOLDER\" ]; then\n  echo \"Save location doesn't exist: $SAVE_FOLDER\"\n  exit 1\nfi\n\nfor PID in $ALL_PID; do\n  declare -a OUTFILES=($(ls -lt1 /proc/$PID/fd | grep '/tmp/Flash' | sed 's/^.*\\/tmp\\///' | sed 's/\\ .*$//'))\n  declare -a FDS=($(ls -lt1 /proc/$PID/fd | grep '/tmp/Flash' | awk '{ print $9 }' ))\n  for ((i=0; i<${#FDS[@]}; i++)); do\n    saveas=\"$SAVE_FOLDER/${OUTFILES[i]}.flv\"\n    echo \"Copying video ${FDS[i]} to $saveas\"\n    cp $CPMOD \"/proc/$PID/fd/${FDS[i]}\" \"$saveas\"\n  done\ndone\n\nThose who know a bit about the terminal can edit the first two variables and achieve a little extra functionality. Alternatively, to view the files live, you can type this in a terminal to find out where they are for i in $(pgrep -f libflash); do find /proc/$i/fd/ -ls | grep \"/tmp/Flash\" | awk '{ print $11 }'; done\nPS. Also, excellent work chlumma1, but lay off the C programming style loops a bit ;)\n\nA: You can use several Firefox addons in order to extract the FLV files from many websites such as Youtube.\nI'll show below how to do this MANUALLY with the latest version of the Flash plugin.\n\n\n*\n\n*Visit the YouTube video and wait for it to be downloaded fully.\n\n*Then, run from the command line the command \n$ lsof -n | grep Flash \nwhich shows the files (even memory files!), and filters to those that have Flash in their name.\n\n*You get something like \nplugin-co 2461          user   17u      REG                8,5  1693301     524370 /tmp/FlashXXVkHEM6 (deleted). \nNow, there is a /tmp/FlashXXVkHEM6 but it has been deleted.\n\n*In Linux, if a file is deleted, it is actually gone only when all programs that opened it earlier are closed. That is, the Flash plugin is using a trick to hide the /tmp/FlashXXVkHEM6 file. It creates it and immediately deletes it. But since the Flash plugin keeps running, it can apparently still use it.\n\n*From the above line we note the number 2461, which is the process ID. In your case it will be probably different. Then, run \n$ cd /proc/2461/fd \nand finally execute \n$ ls -l \nThis will show you the memory files, and specifically \nlrwx------ 1 user user 64 2011-09-16 10:23 17 -> /tmp/FlashXXVkHEM6 (deleted) \nThe number '17' (in my case) is the filename you can use to access the deleted /tmp/FlashXXVkHEM6. Therefore, simply run \n$ cp 17 /tmp/myyoutubevideo.flv \nand you restore the Youtube Video!\nThat's it! You manually recovered the Youtube video!\n\nA: An update to the flash plugin changed the location from /tmp to the Firefox cache directory (e.g. ~/.mozilla/firefox/bq95m4w1.default/Cache). Unfortunately the cached flash file is not as easy to find as before, but it is possible.\nThe following command lists all the flash files in your Firefox cache.\nfind ~/.mozilla/firefox/*.default/Cache -type f -exec file {} \\;  | grep Flash\n\nOn Newer versions of ubuntu try\nfind ~/.cache/mozilla/firefox/*.default/Cache -type f -exec file {} \\;  | grep Flash\n\n\nA: Recent versions of the flash plugin hide the temporary file by marking it deleted. Practically the video stream is downloaded to a \"deleted file\". However, even when a file is deleted, if the file is opened by a process then you can find its file descriptor and consequently the file contents. \nThis simple script prints out the file descriptors of opened Flash videos:\nfile /proc/*/fd/* 2>/dev/null | grep Flash | cut -f1 -d:\n\nAnd, you probably want to create a regular file from the file descriptor, for example:\ncp $(file /proc/*/fd/* 2>/dev/null | grep Flash | cut -f1 -d: | head -n 1) video.avi\n\nOtherwise the file descriptor is not very convenient (remember, it's a deleted file!)\nThe method should work regardless of your browser.\n\nA: Hey, \nthis problem already existed in 10.10.\nSo in order to solve it try this:\nNone of the methods described by previous posters are as convenient as just copying the flash file from the tmp directory.\n\nTherefore, what I did was downgrade my Flash to 10.1.102.64\n\nThe download link for older versions of flash is http://kb2.adobe.com/cps/142/tn_14266.html\n\nDownload the (large) file named \"Flash Player 10.1.102.64 and 9.0.289.0\".\nAfter downloading, extract the file named flashplayer10_1r102_64_linux.tar.gz\n\nFrom this file extract libflashplayer.so and overwrite the file at /usr/lib/flashplugin-installer (you will need root privileges, try gksudo nautilus)\n\nRestart Firefox and your flash videos will land up in the /tmp directory as before! This won't work for Google Chrome, it will continue to use the latest version of Flash.\n\nNote: For the above steps to work, a version of Adobe Flash should have been previously installed.\n\n[quoted from this site: posted by chetancrasta View Post]\nI hope this will help you. \nLet me know if this'll work.\n\nA: For a generally applicable method which works with chrome or firefox try this little program called flashcache. It copies flash videos currently being played back to the current directory.\nMy patch adds the option -p which makes the script play back the videos using mplayer instead of making copies of the files.\n\nA: I use minitube, a youtube client that STORES flash files on /tmp\n\nA: Although not directly answering the question, I ran into the same issue and after some searching found Clipgrab which is much easier to use.\n\nA: follow this link (~/.mozilla/firefox/ewzggcll.default/Cache)\nUnless I'm really confused (don't think so), that \"ewzggcll\" will not be in your machine. What you will find there is a random collection of letters (and possibly numbers?) that's very likely to be unique to your Linux and Firefox installation. Nevertheless, this odd-looking random collection is important, because it's essential for getting at the cache[s].\nHope this helps!

I am working with visually impaired children in Kenya and would like to know if Orca screen reader comes with Edubuntu and whether it would work with the various educational packages on Edubuntu.\nMany thanks\nMartin Muckle\n\nA: Edubuntu is basically Ubuntu with an additionally installed meta package. Therefore all applications that are available for Ubuntu will also be available in Edubuntu, including Orca. From version >=11.04 you will also have a package selection on installation of Edubuntu.\nOrca is an integral part of the GNOME desktop and should therefore run fine in Edubuntu as GNOME is also the default desktop environment there. \nHowever some of the applications bundeled with Edubuntu make use of KDE. Depending on the application in question you may need to test the Orca acessibility for these individually.\nUnfortunately Orca is not yet sufficiently integrated in Unity, therefore using the classical GNOME desktop is recommended.\n", "Q: Boot time is super fast, how come?

It's a genius system.\n\n*X (the graphical desktop to most people) is now loaded very early on. By getting it ready faster, you can show the user something much quicker.\n\n*Removing deadwood from initramfs (the image that is loaded by grub to boot the system)\n\n*Various caching mechanisms have come and gone including sreadahead and ureadahead. These work by generating a binary block of files your system uses at boot so that can be read off the hard disk in one go.\nComparing 8.10 and 10.10, you probably only see a sixth of the boot time now. It's a very impressive improvement... But that doesn't really explain why it's faster than other systems.\nFor that I think I can only really say they're heavier and aren't as good at booting service in parallel.\n\nA: That is early loading of readahead technology + independent init of hardware devices + not so many system services to load + a lot of them load after presentin a UI to user. \n\nA: Boot time of ubuntu is not 7 seconds AFAIK. The fastest you can get is 15-30 seconds boot time (login time not included). The fastest boot of a full Desktop OS I have heard of chromeOS which is 3 seconds(that too when it comes with their hardware). \nIt takes time to load drivers, scripts etc. Any ways boot time in Ubuntu(and other Linux distros) is faster than others because they use modern techniques already discussed above.\nhttp://www.tuxradar.com/content/benchmarked-ubuntu-vs-vista-vs-windows-7\n", "Q: Is there any daemon which constantly monitors system and execute script? Is there any daemon in ubuntu which constantly monitors system and execute script for specified cases (Like RAM uses increased 90%)? \nMy soul purpose is to get a notification whenever resource consumption increases sharply.\n\nA: You'll likely want to setup either Nagios or it's most recent fork Icinga. Nagios is a monitoring solution that can run locally or on remote machines (if you manage multiple machines in a network). You configure which services to monitor and the threshold for being notified. There are even ways to have fall back procedures in place - for instance: if a service fails you can have Nagios attempt to restart it X times before finally notifying you.\nI'm not sure if Icinga is in the repos yet, but Nagios has been for quite sometime now.\n", "Q: Why doesn't Transmission respect my 1 KB/sec upload limit? I'm using Ubuntu 10.10, and have a question about the network activity of Transmission 2.22. Even though I set the global upload limit to 1kbs/s or even 0kb/s, my System Monitor/Conky shows  a steady 20-25 kb/s upload rate. I'm just curious, what's with this upload rate and is there any chance to reduce it?\n\nA: The upload speed limit of Transmission limits the data itself, not the BitTorrent protocol data. It will have a steady consumption above the limit, the amount of consumption relates to the number of torrents, peers, DHT being on and other. \nThe only way to limit it altogether is to limit with outer resources, like creating a slowed down bridge connection or connecting through proxy on localhost.\n", "Q: When piping input from one program to another, what happens to the original program if the program receiving output is killed? I am piping the output of a program like this using bash:\nprogram1 | program2\n\nIf program2 is killed somehow (in my case by a PHP fatal error), what happens to the instance of program1?\n\nA: It greatly depends on what program1 is. The software needs to be able to handle (or ignore) a SIGPIPE signal. program1 will be responsible for handling the error - if the software is open source you should be able to discern what happens or if it traps/detects a SIGPIPE signal. If the software doesn't do anything special with streams it will likely complete execution before passing on the results. I attempted a small example to show the point using two php scripts.\nprogram1\n#!/usr/bin/env php\n<?php\n\n@unlink('program1.out');\n\nfor( $i = 0; $i < 10; $i++ )\n{\n    // This goes to either the buffer or whoever is next in the pipe\n    echo $i . PHP_EOL;\n    // Put everything in a file so we can see what Program1 actually did\n    file_put_contents('program1.out', $i . PHP_EOL, FILE_APPEND);   \n}\n\n// All done! Cap off the file\nfile_put_contents('program1.out', 'Fin', FILE_APPEND);\n\nprogram2\n#!/usr/bin/env php\n<?php\n\n// We're taking inputs and just redirecting them to program2.out\n// but to make it fun I'll throw an error half way through\n// because I'm malicious like that\n\n@unlink('program2.out');\n\n$pipe_input = file(\"php://stdin\");\n$pipe_total = count($pipe_input);\n$stop = rand(0, $pipe_total - 1);\n\necho \"I'll be stopping at $stop\" . PHP_EOL;\n\nforeach( $pipe_input as $key => $input )\n{\n    if( $key == $stop )\n    {\n        file_put_contents('program2.out', 'Dead!', FILE_APPEND);\n        die(1);\n    }\n\n    file_put_contents('program2.out', $input, FILE_APPEND);\n}\n\nWhen you execute ./program1 | ./program2 you'll get two .out files one for each program. In the example I ran I got the following files:\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\nFin\n\nAnd for program2.out\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\nDead!\n\nThe first program will execute and pass it's contents to the second. You'll notice that the first program's .out file has a full set of numbers and the second only contains a set of that because it was killed off.\n\nA: The pipe will be broken and the program writing to the pipe will receive a SIGPIPE signal.\nFrom GLIBC:\n\nSIGPIPE\n      Broken pipe. If you use pipes or FIFOs, you have to design your\n  application so that one process opens\n  the pipe for reading before another\n  starts writing. If the reading process\n  never starts, or terminates\n  unexpectedly, writing to the pipe or\n  FIFO raises a SIGPIPE signal. If\n  SIGPIPE is blocked, handled or\n  ignored, the offending call fails with\n  EPIPE instead.\n\n\nA: Nothing. Data goes to /dev/null. \nP.S. Oh, yes, the program will recieve a signal, but it doesn't mean it will have to close. \n\nA: The short answer is that program1 dies.\nprogram1 gets a SIGPIPE signal when the pipe is broken.  Programs designed to be long running daemons usually handle the signal and do proper cleanup, but your typical interactive program does not.  The default action is to terminate the program, so for the most part, program1 will just be terminated.\n", "Q: Cannot get Dell Wireless WLAN 1397 Minicard to work I am not sure if this is the right place for this question, but I currently am running Ubuntu 10.10 and have windows installed with the dual boot option. My wireless card is the Dell Wireless WLAN 1397 Minicard. When running Windows, it detects and connects to all the available wireless networks that I have access to. However, when i boot into Ubuntu, it connects to the wireless networks only sometimes, other time ,on entering the username and passphrase, it tries to connect for about a minute and then fails to do so. I read the following on a forum as a temporary fix:\nI Should turn the system off, remove the battery, reconnect and turn it on again.\nThis always works, but it really inconvenient and sometimes, looses connectivy after about 5 minutes of having connected. I would like to point out that it worked fine when I was running Ubuntu 10.04\nAny help is much appreciated.\n\nA: Try the latest drivers for this 1397 driver. I remember this driver is a non free one. You can find updates or new non-free drivers from Additional Drivers application which can be found under System -> Preferences \n", "Q: Is it possible to slipstream updates?

In Chrome forums they recommend to clear cache, but that works in some cases...\nYou can try Chromium and install Adobe Flash separately (Chrome includes a customized version of Flash).\n\nA: I think that Chrome is not the problem, the unique problem is Flash. Now I'm watching a video in window mode and CPU is nearly at 90%, but if I put it to fullscreen mode it decrease to 50%. Seems to be a problem with scaling video or something similar.\n\nA: Found the issue, it has to do with the standalone version of Flash and Chrome's integrated Flash conflicting with one another, trying to load both at the same time\nDo the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*In Chrome's address bar, type \"about:plugins\" (no space between colon and plugins)\n\n*This will bring up a list of plugins\n\n*Look for the Flash plugin and when you find it, it may say 2 or more files. For example mine said 3 as shown here: Flash (3 files) - Version: 11,4,402,265 \n\n*Over to the far right is a DETAILS link. Click on it. This will bring up details for each file/version you have installed\n\n*Look at the \"Location:\" of each version – some may be the integrated Chrome version (…Application Data\\Google\\Chrome etc) and the other is the standalone Adobe (formerly Macromedia) version which is in the …Windows\\system32\\Macromed\\Flash etc directory.\n\n*You don't want the integrated Chrome version(s). Click on \"Disable\" just under the Location(s) of the Chrome version to disable it (and it will become grayed out)\n\n*Ensure that the standalone Adobe version is still enabled – if it is disabled (grayed out) click the ‘Enable’ link just under its Location to enable it) then close the Plugins tab\nYou're good to go. This should get rid of Flash constantly using 100% CPU for Flash videos.\n\nA: Try using Lightspark, an alternative to Adobe's flash:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:sparkers/daily\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install lightspark browser-plugin-lightspark\n\nAnd then:\nsudo apt-get install lightspark browser-plugin-lightspark\n\nSource: http://www.unixmen.com/lightspark-a-good-alternative-to-adobe-flash-player-ppa-ubuntu-fedora-rpm/\n", "Q: How do I configure apt to use a Proxy.pac file?

My boss felt somewhat burned by VMs he purchased from a hosting company not living up to the performance level expected, so any capacity numbers for KVM VMs that I can use as a basis for my calculations are appreciated.\n\nA: It depends on how busy they will be and how much ram you plan on allocating to them.  For a basic setup, I would consider 1-2 gb for each vm, so you should be able to run 10-20 if they aren't heavily cpu bound.\n\nA: The art of capacity-planning is not an exact science - it does depend on several inputs - chief amongst which are:\n\n\n*\n\n*What OS are you intending to run\n\n*What will the OS be running 50% of the time\n\n*What is the expected memory usage for that 50%\n\n*What is the expected CPU usage for that 50%\n\n*How much Host RAM\n\n*How much Host CPU - roughly cores multiplied by number of processors\n\n\nThe target you should be looking at is roughly 75% CPU & Memory Usage for all VM instances.\nKVM does have fairly good memory management and as such you can overallocate [balloon] memory that would be made available by the host.\nRed-Hat/Cent OS have a similar feature as VMWare ESX where KVM can page in/page out memory segments shared by different OS's - hence you can squeeze even more VMs.\nThus - lets assume you are running 11.04 desktop for each VM instance.  The majority of the work is users using Firefox & LibreOffice - taking up, say half of the required memory (Ubuntu minimum is a recommended 1GB), but little in the way of CPU usage.  I would expect (wet finger in the air) for a 24GB host to be able to run 32 VM's.  On Red-Hat/Cent OS - you perhaps could increase this to 48 VM's.\nAgain - not an exact science, but not knowing what the chief areas (1 to 6 above) are, just an educated guess.\n", "Q: How do I deactivate F1 and F10 keybindings in gnome-terminal?

Note that these kind of tricks seem to be highly Gnome / Ubuntu version dependent.\n\nA: If you only want to change this in Gnome Terminal you can click Edit>Keyboard Shortcuts in the Terminal.\n\nA: I recommend using F1 as a shortcut for something else. I run Tilda, a quake-style command line terminal, and the default shortcut is F1. It overrides Help, so I never have Help launching when I hit F1. Even if you don't like Tilda much, hitting F1 again to hide it is much less tedious than closing Help after accidentally launching it.\n\nA: 12.04\nF1 doesn't appear to do anything out of the box on 12.04\nF10 appears to simulate a right mouse click\nSo in response to the specifics of the question, there's no need to disable help and notifications.\nYou can still map them to something else like this:\nMapping hot-keys in 12.04 is simply accomplished through the Keyboard widget.\nIn the Unity launcher find keyboard.\n\nIn the window that opens select the shortcuts tab and custom shortcuts.\nClick the plus to add a new shortcut.\n\nName it to whatever matches the functionality you're assigning it.\nEnter the command you want it to run in command.\n\nAt the right side of the window click where it says disabled.

Many of the  tools that modify the behaviour of Unity, therefore, don't work.  In particular CCSM no longer \"sees\" the keyboard shortcuts.\nI found that the method using Edit->Keyboard Shortcuts in the terminal window also didn't work.  After a bit of playing around I found that looking farther down the Keyboard Shortcuts window in the Shortcut Keys section, F1 and F11 were still defined to their respective shortcuts.  \nTo fix this, \n\n\n*\n\n*Click on the \"F11\" in the right hand field of the line that defines\nF11 as Fullscreen.

Which file/line in compiz source code?\nUsability background\nAccording to Fitts, Accot, and Zhai, the time required to rapidly move to a target area is a function of the distance to and the size of the target\n(cf. Fitts's law and Steering law).\nDrag'n'Drop without Alt-Tab across fullscreen windows requires\n\n\n*\n\n*start to drag object\n\n*move to launcher/taskbar\n\n*steer to target app icon -- small and distant target!\n\n*wait for app to become focused\n\n*steer onto window -- (huge target)\n  optionally: steer onto intended area of window, e.g. playlist (fairly large target)\n\n*drop object\n\n\nDrag'n'Drop with Alt-Tab on the other hand only requires\n\n\n*\n\n*start to drag object\n\n*Alt-Tab to other app\n  optionally: steer onto intended area of window, e.g. playlist (fairly large target)\n\n*drop object\n\n\nThus, no small and distant target required for Drag'n'Drop whilst Alt-tabbing\nWorkarounds\nInteresting and probably for many users useful alternative approaches are presented in the answers below. Great many thanks to the community!\nCorrect answer\n... seems to be available only when the bug is fixed, though.\nSome more recent action, maybe relevant as related bug: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ayatana-design/+bug/727903\n\nA: The way I found it working:\n\n\n*\n\n*Start dragging,\n\n*Keeping your mouse button pressed, press Super + (0-9) to switch the application,\n\n*Continue dragging and drop.\n\n\nNote: In step 2 you can hold the Super key for a moment, the launcher will appear and will display you which number (0-9) is assigned to which application.\n\nA: I haven't found a reliable way to drop file-manager files onto (for example) Totem whilst the receiving application is full-screen - however if you dont make the receiving application full-screen, the following works for me.\nRun CCSM and edit the Scale Addon.\nClick \"Initiate Window Picker\" (initiate edge i.e. the one with the monitor icon) and assign BottomRight to it.\nNext start the receiving application (not full screen).\nInitiate Drag-and-drop from file manager for the files you want - drag the mouse to the BottomRight of the screen - SpreadMode will occur for all windows.  Drag the mouse to receiving application.  Spread Mode will close, with the receiving application as the active window.  Drop the item(s) you have been dragging.\nI've tried this with the example of Totem as full-screen. It works some of the time, but not reliably.  I think its the global-menu that is grabbing various events.\nN.B. To get the example Totem to accept one of more files on the drop will need a slight-modification to its desktop launcher as described in this AU question\n\nA: Assuming that you have the app open that you want to drop onto: start dragging the file, go over to the launcher (which should show shortly after you start dragging) and hover on the app that you want to drop to, this should show the open windows of that app, then while still dragging the file, hover on the window you want to drop to and wait for that window to become active (the default is 500ms but this can be changed in ccsm) you can then drop the file wherever you like.\nThis may sound long winded but it doesn't take very long, especially if you turn down the \"Drag and Drop Hover Timeout\" in the Behaviour tab of the Scale plugin in ccsm (available in the Software Centre), I have mine at 200ms and that's fine.\n\nA: Another workaround to drag and drop between two applications:\n\n\n*\n\n*Click and start dragging the item in the window of Application #1\n\n*Click ALT+F1 to activate the Launcher item selection mode\n\n*This may be a little uncomfortable: press the down (or up) arrow key on the keyboard to move the Launcher cursor to the Application #2\n\n*Press the Enter key to activate the selected Application #2\n\n*Drop the dragged item on to the window that pops up\n\n\nNote: this does not work (at least this way) with two windows of the same application.\n\nA: Not related to totem, but i've found a way to alt-tab while drag-and-dropping files (drag pycharm file to chrome). Tested on Ubuntu 20. The main detail is to not move a mouse until you finished alt-tabbing.\n\n*\n\n*Click on file and keep mouse button pressed.\nDON'T MOVE THE CURSOR.

I'm not sure if it is better to install final release after it officially ready (or week later when most problems fixed) or it is OK to have patched beta? I think that new is better than patched old, am I right?  \n\nA: It makes no difference if you upgrade or install the final version from scratch; if it works now and you want to install it now then go for it.\n\nA: If you've installed Ubuntu from say alpha/beta and you have steadily downloaded and installed the updates then you won't need to reinstall it as you will be fully up-to-date and will have the final version.\n\nA: You are encouraged to use beta version as the more people will use it the more robust would be the final version. \n\"A stitch in time saves nine\", So even just 1 day left in final release of Ubuntu still if you can find any (small) bug it can be patched before final release. \nGo for Beta!! and you can upgrade beta as soon as it is launched.

I have also installed additional software from Ubuntu's Software Center.\nIf I use that same Live USB to install Ubuntu on a machine, will it also install all updated and new software or will it just install what came in the original image?\n\nA: if you install packages  to the usb with the Persistence mode  then use the installer it will NOT as far as i have seen Install the new packages to the installed system. \nFor example, you make a live-usb with persistence and install the nvidia drivers. Then boot the usb in a nvidia laptop  it should run fine. However when you install to the laptop the nvidia drivers will NOT get installed to the new install. \nThis is both a good thing and a bad thing. It would be nice if you could install the extra packages, however there may often be cases where you would not want an exact copy. (on an pc using ATI video chipset for example)\nThere are ways to 'remaster' a live cd to include extra packages. This remastered live cd, could then be used to make a live flash that would install the extra packages also.\nIn the example above (about nvidia drivers)  i should point out that i have had issues in the past with the Persistence mode actually using the drivers. I had to alter some things to get them to start up properly. I have not tested how well this works in 11.04 yet.  I normally install the nvidia drivers to a Persistence mode flash drive in order to make installing easier on my nvidia machines.\n\nA: When you say update it often, do you mean you run Update Manger, or you download and install a new ISO? You are most likely running in Live USB mode, which means all changes to the original image are discarded after you shutdown. So to answer your question, no, anything you install from (e.g, Software Center, terminal, synaptic.) will be discarded after a system shutdown, unless you are running the USB in Persistence mode.\nPersistence mode may be what you want. Do note that you will need a healthy amount of free space available on the Flash Drive.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open a terminal, and run the command\ngksudo usb-creator-gtk\n\n*Choose your ISO, and the drive you\nwish to install to.\n\n*Choose stored in reserved extra\nspace, and adjust the slider to the\namount of space you want to use to\nstore your changes. *****\n\n***** Do note that the maximum amount of persistence you can add is 4GB.\n", "Q: Installing Snippits fails I am trying to install snippits, but it fails with the error message \nERROR:  Error installing snippits:\n    hoe requires RubyGems version >= 1.4\n\nHow do I get around this?\n\nA: I think you just have to install RubyGems to:\nsudo aptitude install rubygems\n\n(or search in synaptic for rubygems)\nOk, just recognized there is no RubyGems > 1.3.7 in the Ubuntu repository (Debian actually has a 1.6 in sid...).

Open up Disk Utility and click on the 'top-level' of the hard disk in the left-hand side panel.

You'll notice you now have two partitions. (Nothing's been written or changed yet. You can still change your mind.) Between the two partitions there's a little handle which you can drag up and down. Move that so you've got enough room for an Ubuntu install. I'd say 20 GB is sufficient but it's very subjective. It's certainly enough to get started, and if you feel you need more down the track you just repeat this procedure.\nClick on the new proposed white partition. There's a drop-down box to the right. Choose format as 'Free Space'. Have one last look to make sure you're satisfied and click 'Apply'.\nDisk Utility will do its thing and very soon you'll have a brand new empty bit of HDD to install Ubuntu on.\nIncidentally, the Live CD is much slower than a native install but it gives you some idea of what to expect.\n__\nI note your picture. Did your Disk Utility screen look like this immediately prior to your picture being taken?\n\n\nA: It should be. Depending on what kind of mac you have you'll need different versions (if it's an intel mac you can use any of the ubuntu live cds, I think you'll be able to run x64, but I don't remember if all macs have 64-bit processors.

The created launcher is also compatible with Gnome Shell.\n\n\nA: I worked it out :D\nIn Terminal\ngedit ~/.local/share/applications/<Your App Name>.desktop\n\nIn gedit\nHere you should edit:\nYou can find more details and more keys in the freedesktop.org docs\n[Desktop Entry]\n# Define which specification version this entry is using \nVersion=1.0\n# The application name (eg. \"Gnome Terminal\", \"Firefox\")\nName=My Awesome App\n# The generic app name (eg. \"Terminal\", \"Web Browser\")\nGenericName=Awesome App\n# The Tooltip\nComment=This app is awesome!\n# The command you want to execute\nExec=/path/to/sh/file/file.sh\n# Whether the app should run in a terminal window\nTerminal=false\n# The pretty picture :D\nIcon=/opt/PhpStorm-103.243/bin/webide.png\n# The type of the desktop entry (Application, Link, or Directory)\nType=Application\n# Categoies the app should be in\nCategories=Network;WebBrowser;\n# Mime types this launcher can open\nMimeType=text/html;\n# Localized version of the above info\nName[en_NZ]=My Awesome App\nGenericName[en_NZ]=Awesome App\nComment[en_NZ]=This app is awesome!\n\nSave the file.\nNow your application will show in searches :)\n\nA: More \"graphical \" way of doing this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to folder ~/.local/share/applications using Nautilus or whatever file explorer.\n\n*Copy and paste some existing shortcut with icon you like.\n\n*Right click on new shortcut and change property to point to your script or application.\n\n*Drag it on launcher/taskpan.\n\n*You can also open it in text editor and do more fine tuning.\n\n\nA: Alacarte application can help you. You can also find it under \"Main Menu\". Use the Software Center or\nsudo apt-get install alacarte\n\nJust choose a folder (not very important if you have Gnome 3, unless you use some menu extension) and then on the right New Item. Here you can give the new launcher a name and browse to its location. You can also provide a logo by clicking on the logo.\n\nA: I'm using the gnome-shell in Ubuntu 11.10 and created my launcher for PhpStorm using the same method in Gnome 3 that I would have used in Gnome 2: I used the Main Menu application.\n\nThe application shows up in search and can be added to Favorites without any hiccups.\n\nA: Getting the program to show up in the search seems to be difficult at best, which I'm sure will get better as Gnome3 matures and progresses. (The state of Gnome3 right now will certainly not be the same in a month.) \nIn order to add an application as a favorite (so that it shows up in the launcher on the left of the \"Activities\" screen), simply hit Alt+F2, and run the application or script you want. While it is running, enter the \"Activities\" screen, and drag the running application to the favorites. I have used this only for programs that use a GUI, but feel free to play with it.\nHope that helps. \nI will add: I'm not in love with Gnome3 as it currently stands, but it's a step ahead of Unity, and I'm excited to see where it goes in the future. One great thing about open software, it moves fast. We should see a rapid progression in changing and adding features. These are critical times in the evolution of the desktop metaphor.\n\nA: You could install the MyLauncher extension. It will produce a menu on the panel which you can edit by right-clicking.

Why is the maximum download speed now 30kb/s instead of the 2.5mb/s I used to have?\n\nA: I've found out the problem; it's some sort of problem with my wifi driver (ath9k) which was resolved with a simple command:\nsudo -s\necho \"options ath9k nohwcrypt=1\" > /etc/modprobe.d/ath9k.conf\n\n\nA: I had the same issue, but only after upgrade to 11.10.

Any recent Intel video card should be fine.\nIf you plan for an AMD CPU, then an AMD/ATI card is a good choice. You have significant chances that the card will be supported by the open-source driver, and if that fails for now, you have the closed driver. \nWith NVidia products, is almost similar with AMD/ATI, with the big exception that the open-source driver receives no support from NVidia.\nThe page https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardwareSupportComponentsVideoCards is good but not updated so often. Check the last update date for each of the pages.\n\nA: Asus EN210. Yes it is marketed as a home-theatre card, but the home-theatre interfaces are really just graphic-intensive applications running on 1920x1080 displays, with 3d & transparency effects, video playback and maybe some flash.

This was very helpful for newbies like me who don't want to play with hard drive partitions.\nI would like to install Ubuntu on my laptop as my primary operating system while keeping Windows.  When I get to the screen that says \"Allocate Disk Space,\" I click specify partitions manually because I don't want to erase Windows.\nProblem is, I don't know how to specify partitions manually.  It's all one huge green bar called sda1 (ntfs).  What do I do next?\nIf I press install now, it says no root files system is defined.\nI tried the \"shrink volume\" function in Windows, but it complained telling me to run chkdsk, so I right clicked the c drive and nagivated to the chkdsk utility, told it to run on the next startup, which it didn't.\nI am running Windows 7.\nEDIT: I figured it out, see answer below\n\nA: What Windows version are you running? I assume Vista or 7?\nYou should really do a chkdsk before messing with the volume. Press Start, type cmd. Click with the right mousebutton on the found cmd.exe and choose \"Run as administrator\".\nNow type \"chkdsk c: /f\" (without quotes) and press enter.\nNow, it'll ask \"Chkdsk cannot run because the volume is in use [...] next time the system restarts? (Y/N)\". Answer Yes. Now reboot into Windows again to have the disk checked and fixed if needed.\nAfter this is done, AND you have made backups of your valueable data, you can boot into Ubuntu again. When booted into the desktop environment, start 'gparted' to get a nice partition manager to shrink the Windows partition. When that is done, you can Install Ubuntu hopefully without any problem.\n\nA: What you need to do is run chkdsk manually during bootup.  Spam F8 during bootup, select the repair option and start a command prompt window.  Then type chkdsk c: /f to fix the volume.\n\nA: If an NTFS partition is shrunk, Windows will run chkdsk on the next reboot. At least it always has done so in the past for me. It's very important that this is done.\nI'm assuming that you've already shrunk your Windows partition from inside Windows using the Windows utility. If you haven't done so you should do so now. It's always a good idea to first defragment the drive before you shrink an NTFS partition.\nOK, so now you have some extra space where you're going to install Ubuntu. Pop the installation CD in the drive and when you get to the partitioning stage you'll now see the green ntfs Windows partition, but also a bar of unallocated space.\nChoose the manual method.\nI don't know how much unallocated space you have but ideally you now want to put three partitions in that unallocated space. These will be:\n\n\n*\n\n*/     [root file system] - format as ext4 - (10-15 GB should suffice)\n\n*swap  [Windows uses a swap file, but generally Ubuntu dedicates its own partition] - format as swap - (4 GB should be enough. Some advocate 1.5 x the amount of RAM you have but I've always found 4 GB to be plenty)\n\n*/home [Ubuntu's version of My Documents] - format as ext4 - (all the rest of the space you have left on the hard drive)\n\n\nThe installer will ask you to check and confirm you want to make these changes. The important thing is that the ntfs partition isn't reformatted as that will nuke your Windows install.\nLater in the process you will be asked where to install the boot loader (Grub2). Choose to put this in the MBR. Note that you'll still be able to boot Windows in the future but now you'll have a menu (Grub2) at boot up time to choose between Ubuntu or Windows.\n", "Q: How to get Red5 working?

I have a simple question.\nWhen you install a package using apt-get install, oftentimes, it will install several dependency packages as well as the main one. I was wondering if there is a way to completely reverse this install. Often, removing the main package will leave several packages behind. For example, I recently installed kubuntu-desktop. Wanting to completely remove it, I had to follow the instructions on this page:\nhttp://www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/puregnome\nI would like to know exactly how they obtained that information concerning all the packages to uninstall. \nThanks for any help!\n\nA: In most cases the autoremove command of apt-get would do the trick, it will remove all packages installed and marked as automatically installed, but not required by any other installed package. \nThis is the preferred and secure method when the master package is not a metapackage.\nThis is not the case for metapackages like kubuntu-desktop, and this is because packages installed as a consequence of the installation of a metapackage are not marked as automatically installed, so that cannot be remove by autoremove.\nRemoving all packages marked as dependences of, or recommended by a given metapackage, like kubuntu-desktop, could be dangerous, because some of those packages could be on your system before the installation of the metapackage.\nThe most secure method to proceed, in my opinion, is an analysis of /var/log/dpkg.log and its ancestors, to see which packages were installed in timestamps around the timestamp of the installation of the given offending package. I suggest a command to get a more terse and cleaned-up view of the concatenation of the involved log files:\nless $(ls -rt /var/log/dpkg.log*) |\n  awk '$3 ~ /^(install|upgrade|remove|purge)$/' |\n  less\n\n\nA: Use apt-cache depends to list all the packages \"inside\" a meta package :\napt-cache depends kxstudio-meta-audio-plugins-lv2\nkxstudio-meta-audio-plugins-lv2\n  Depends: carla-lv2\n  Depends: carla\n  Depends: carla-dbg\n  Depends: abgate\n  Depends: avldrums.lv2\n  Depends: drmr\n  Depends: eq10q\n  Depends: freaked-plugins\n  (...)\n\n\nA: Try debfoster. First install it using sudo apt-get install debfoster and then run sudo debfoster kubuntu-desktop. It will remove all meta packages installed as part of kubuntu-desktop.\n\nA: I think the easiest way to find out what packages came with something like kubuntu-desktop (or any other package) would be to check out http://packages.ubuntu.com/. This gives you a detailed listing of everything that is required, recommended and suggested for every package available via the offiial repositories.\nFor 10.10, the kubuntu-desktop package is located here: http://packages.ubuntu.com/maverick/kubuntu-desktop\nIf something is marked \"depends\" it is required for the package to function correctly. If it is marked as \"recommends\" then it is installed by default, but not required (apt-get install --no-intstall-recommends will stop them from being installed), and suggested are purely optional and not installed by default.\nYou can also check in synaptic package manager (installed by default - in the administration menu I believe). Right click any package and select Properties, select the Dependencies tab and make sure the drop down is on \"Dependencies\". This shows you the same information that is found at packages.ubuntu.com.\nAs far as I know, both of those methods list the direct dependencies of the current package, but not dependencies of dependencies. I'm not 100% on this, but it would not surprise me.\nif you install packages via apt-get and it is pulling in dependencies and recommended packages, before you hit the 'y' key, you can always copy the lists of packages that will be installed. Then later you can plug that list into an apt-get remove and it should get rid of all that. Just make sure nothing else you installed (that you want to keep) also depends on anything that's going to be removed.\nAnother useful tool is apt-get autoremove. This will remove anything that you didn't manually install (it was pulled in as a dependency or suggested package) that was a dependency of something that is no longer installed. In my experience, this doesn't always work for meta packages like kubuntu-desktop though.\n", "Q: How to copy command console text? I have used the wpa_passphrase command and I get something like this:\n\nnetwork={  ssid=\"blahblah\"\n      #psk=\"moreblahblah\"     psk=d5e532ecca53ea963e5b3b5521bb3682c53fcf5b6d55f15622027145c795b661 }\n\nI need to copy that \"psk=[long string]\" to my wpa_supplicant.conf file.  How can I select it in order to copy it?  And then what command do I use to copy it?  Such that in my favourite text editor I can press a paste command to paste it?  (ps. I don't have a mouse )\n\nA: if you have a touchpad though, highlight the text and press Ctrl + Shift + C to copy ...\nthe following resources describe how to copy/paste using keyboard only -- screen/byobu:\nHow do I integrate Byobu's copy-buffer with the X clipboard?\nhttp://www.samsarin.com/blog/2007/03/11/gnu-screen-working-with-the-scrollback-buffer/\n\nCopy and Paste in Scrollback mode (screen/byobu)\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Enter scrollback mode: Ctrl+A+[ or in byobu also F7\n  \n*Move the cursor to the start of the text you want to copy, hit spacebar\n  \n*Move the cursor to the end of the text you want to copy and hit enter\n  \n*To paste text, hit Ctrl+A+] or Alt+Insert\n\n\nA: Try this:\nwpa_passphrase | awk '/psk/ {print $4}' >> wpa.supplicant.conf\n\nCommand should take out the \"psk=d5e532ecca53ea963e5b3b5521bb3682c53fcf5b6d55f15622027145c795b661\" part and copy it to the end of your wpa.supplicant.conf file. Try changing $4 to $3 or $2 if you don't get the right part of the wpa_passphrase command.\n\nA: May be not perfect but a workaround. May be you could write the output in a file then go into the file remove unnecessary text and using cat you could append it to wpa_supplicant.conf\nBasically your workflow would be:\ncommand > rough\nnano rough here delete the unnecessary text and keep just the necessary ones i.e psk\nsudo sh -c \"cat rough >> wpa_supplicant.conf\"\nOr may be you could use vim to yank the required text choosing it in visual mode.\nP.S. Someone with good knowledge of sed would give you a easier solution than this I think. \n\nA: Of course the most common way to do this would be to use a mouse or other pointing device (such as a touchpad). Although it's somewhat excentric, it's possible to copy text without a mouse. (You may of course have a valid reason not use a pointing device.) Check out xclip, as in this answer. Thus you could use:\nwpa_passphrase | xclip -sel clip\n\n\nA: The next sed command will fetch the key (which consists of characters from the hexadecimal set) from the output of wpa_passphrase and put it in a temporary file pass.\nwpa_passphrase | sed 's/.*psk=\\([0-9a-f]*\\).*/\\1/' > pass\n\nAs you do not have a mouse, you cannot just select and copy it. We'll use the nano texteditor for inserting this pass:\nnano wpa_suppliciant.conf\n\nMove to your desired location using your arrow keys and press Insert. Enter the name of the file you've just created, pass, followed by an Enter. Quit & save the result by pressing Ctrl + X and confirm it by entering Y followed by an Enter.\n\nA: You can setup a keybinding in byobu to be able to send the text selected in byobu's buffer into the X clipboard.\nAdd the following to ~/.byobu/keybindings\n# Add cool line to make copying to x clipboard possible.\n# This binds C-a b to copy screen's copy buffer to the system clipboard.\nbind b eval writebuf 'exec /bin/sh -c \"xsel -i < $BYOBU_RUN_DIR/printscreen\"'\n\nThen after using the usual F7, move, space to start select, move, enter to save to buffrer, then you can use C-a b (Ctrl-a, then b) to save it to the clipboard\n(Based on https://dodoincfedora.wordpress.com/2012/06/23/integrating-byobuscreens-copy-buffer-with-xgnome-clipboard/)\n", "Q: When do iptables rules become active? I have an script that bans selected IPs from my server.\nExample:\niptables -A INPUT -s 123.123.123.123 -j DROP\n\nMy question is: When this rule will start working?\nI'm asking this, because yesterday I banned an IP, but it was still connected to my server... is something wrong with my command or something else?\n\nA: Operations with iptables and the ip6tables (for IPv6) commands are applied immediately. You might have a rule in your INPUT chain which accepts the traffic before it reaches this one, like:\niptables -A INPUT -m tcp -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT\n\nIf you apply your rule with -A, the rule will be appended after the previous rules and even if you say that traffic from 123.123.123.123 should be blocked, the rule allowing TCP 80 traffic has precedence. It's recommended that you insert a new chain (blocklist below) in your ruleset as in:\nsudo iptables -N blocklist\nsudo iptables -I INPUT -j blocklist\n\nAnd then apply rules to the blocklist chain instead of the INPUT chain:\nsudo iptables -A blocklist -s 123.123.123.123 -j DROP\n\n", "Q: How do I know if a certain blueprint will be discussed at UDS?

I don't have it installed so I can't check (currently running Xubuntu) but I don't believe they have implemented it yet.

Rsync is comparing and copying diffs.\nThe rsync utility first popped into my mind when I saw your question.  Doing something like below could quickly show what files are in directory a but not in b:\n$ rsync -rcnv a/* b/\n\n-r will recurse into the directories\n-c will compare based on file checksum\n-n will run it as a \"dry run\" and make no changes, but just print out the files \n   that would be updated\n-v will print the output to stdout verbosely\n\nThis is a good option because you can compare the contents of the files as well to make sure they match.  rsync's delta algorithm is optimized for this type of use case.

So I have an IBM Thinkpad X31, running natty and xmonad as the window manager. The keyboard is Italian. I wish to use an American English keyboard mapping, all the time. How do I do this?  \n\nA: Here is one way to connect XMonad and multiple keyboard layouts. \nStep 1. Create a script that will switch between your layouts. For the sake of example, let's say we will support English (US), Italian and French.\n/home/you/bin/layout_switch.sh:\n#!/bin/zsh\n# LICENSE: PUBLIC DOMAIN\n# switch between my layouts\n\n# If an explicit layout is provided as an argument, use it. Otherwise, select the next layout from\n# the set [us, it, fr].\nif [[ -n \"$1\" ]]; then\n    setxkbmap $1\nelse\n    layout=$(setxkbmap -query | awk 'END{print $2}')\n    case $layout in\n        us)\n                setxkbmap it\n            ;;\n        it)\n                setxkbmap fr\n            ;;\n        *)\n                setxkbmap us\n            ;;\n    esac\nfi\n\nTest this script - run it and see if the keyboard layout cycles between the layouts. If it does, proceed to the next step.\nStep 2. Customize XMonad settings to support custom key binding that will switch the layout.\nIn your home directory, create a directory named \".xmonad\" (if it does not exist). \n/home/you/.xmonad/xmonad.hs:\nimport XMonad\nimport XMonad.Hooks.DynamicLog\nimport XMonad.Hooks.ManageDocks\nimport XMonad.Util.Run(spawnPipe)\nimport XMonad.Util.EZConfig(additionalKeys)\nimport System.IO\n\nmain = do\n  xmonad $ defaultConfig\n     {\n        terminal = \"gnome-terminal\"\n     } `additionalKeys`\n     [ (( mod1Mask             , xK_Escape), spawn \"/home/you/bin/layout_switch.sh\")\n     ]\n\nNow, restart XMonad by pressing Mod+q. Your layout switcher should be fully functional.\nReference: http://zuttobenkyou.wordpress.com/tag/setxkbmap/\n\nA: You might already have a startup file to launch and configure things at login.\nAdd the following line to use several keyboard layouts:\n# Keyboard layout switcher\nsetxkbmap -layout us,se -variant ,kinesis -option 'grp:alt_shift_toggle'\n\n-layout and -variant work together. Here my layouts are us (no variant, empty before the comma), and se(kinesis). Variants could be dvorak, for example. You can omit variant if you don't want them.\n-option sets here the keyboard shortcut to switch between layouts.\nFor windows to remember their layout:\n# Per window keyboard layout\nkbdd\n\nIf you use xmobar and want to show the current layout, add this to your .xmobarrc Config:\n, commands = [...\n...\n, Run Kbd [(\"se\", \"SE\"), (\"us\", \"US\")]\n]\n...\n, template = \"...... %kbd% \"\n\n\nThat was for all people googling for multiple keyboard layouts and finding this thread. If you want only one keyboard layout, add this to your startup script:\nsetxkbmap -layout us\n\n\nA: To change your keyboard mapping to American English, you run the command setxkbmap us. To integrate it with Xmonad, you add it to the startup hook.\n", "Q: How to setup a file server over the Internet? I would like to be able to access the files in my desktop at home from anywhere over the Internet.\nI don't know much, but I think that would involve setting up a FTP server, right? Can you please point me in the right direction - some reference materials and tutorials?\n\nA: I would discourage you to use FTP, as it's a clear text protocol without any security. \nInstead, I suggest you use ssh. Then you get both secure remote shell access and file transfer, all in one service. apt-get install openssh-server and you are good to go. Then you can connect to your machine through for instance Places -> Connect to server on a Gnome desktop, sftp in a shell, or using WinSCP on Windows.\nTo reach your machine, even with a dynamic ip, you could use a free dynamic dns service such as DynDNS or FreeDNS, which will give you a hostname such as mybox.uni.cx.\nNAT is no issue either, as long as you forward the correct port to your machine. (tcp 22 in case of ssh)\n\nA: ad 1) if you have NAT, you will need to setup port forwarding. If you cannot do that and nothing else will help, you still can run ipv6 tunnel on your home computer and you will be able to connect from other computers with ipv6 connectivity. \nI would recomend disablig password authentification in openssh-server and use key files if you will decide to use openssh-server.\n\nA: I would just add that if you have a download cap on your connection, be careful. usually, if you have a cap, it applies to both upload and download as a total. Also, if you have a cable modem or DSL connection, remember that the upstream portion of your connection (to the internet, in other words) is much more limited than the downstream. \nAs well, some ISPs are blocking some ports. For example, Vidéotron in Quebec (CANADA) is blocking port 80. So if I want to have a web site, I would have to use port 8080, for example. \n\nA: You have to:\n1) Be connected to the internet with a static, global IP address. No NAT or VPN bridge or whatever. \n2) Set up an FTP server, the simpler - the better. Be sure not to allow anonymous access accidentaly. \n", "Q: 11.04 on MacBook Pro 7,1?

That means you are useing an hardware RAID.\nIf this is the case, you should upgrade your RAID driver (modules) for the System/new kernel.\nOn the other Hand your posted output looks like there are 2 disk controlled by the mainboard RAID controller (sda & sdd).\nHow many disk are attached to your RAID Controller?\nBecause: if you are using an \"hardware RAID\" (configured on the mainboard/bios) so new kernel modules (driver) will be the solution (as i said).\nIf your RAID controller doen't build the RAID array and simply passed through the disk to the operating system, so you are using an software RAID (build by the ubuntu system).

For a smooth upgrade from 10.04 to 10.10, I would like to remove all packages which are not in the default repositories (e.g. chromium PPA and third-party repositories). What is the easiest way (preferably CLI) to find and remove these packages?\nEdit: this question is not restricted to PPA's, I have a x2go repository as well, so I'm looking for a generic command to remove packages belonging to a certain repository. For PPA's, the question How can PPAs be removed has great answers.\n\nA: Here is GUI ways to do so. Hope it would help for those who don't prefer CLI. The steps are simple and easy to follow.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open synaptic package manager. If not installed then install it by:\nsudo apt-get install synaptic\n\n\n*When opened click on Origin button on down-left. It will list all the repositories on top-left side. Select the particular repository for which packages are to be removed. It will list all the packages under that repository. Click the first field i,e S or Installed Version field to show the installed packages first.\n\n*Now select all packages to remove. \nTips to mark for removal: \n\n\n*\n\n*Select first package then hold Shift key and again select the last package to select all. Then right click on the square box and select mark for removal or mark for complete removal.\n\n*or Select any packages and press Ctrl+A to select all. Then right click on the square box and chose mark for removal or mark for complete removal.\nThat's it. It will remove without any problem. I've also attached the image to make it more clear. Hope it would help. :)\n\n\nA: To at least find them, start by disabling the PPA's and run apt-get update. Then install apt-show-versions. Running apt-show-versions | grep 'No available' will then give you a list of all your installed packages that cannot be found in your configured repositories. With some command-line magic you can probably strip out the package names only and pass them to apt-get remove:\n for i in `apt-show-versions | grep 'No available' | cut -d' ' -f 1` ; do  sudo apt-get remove -y $i ; done\n\nNote that this will go through the list returned from apt-show-versions and remove them one by one.  Depending on what it finds, this could uninstall something unintended due to dependencies, so check it first.\n\nA: Check out ppa-purge .\nUsage:\nppa-purge -purge <nameofppa> [-s hostserver]\n\nHostserver defaults to ppa.launchpad.net.\nHere is the link to the manpage for the ppa-purge command  for reference.\n\nA: Overcoming aptitude's Multiarch Bug for ppa-purge\nNormally, as Vadim Rutkovsky and Takkat have explained, running ppa-purge with default syntax is an effective way to remove all packages provided by a PPA, properly downgrading them to versions provided in other configured software sources whenever possible.\nHowever, as Takkat has pointed out, bug 831768 prevents ppa-purge from working properly to remove multiarch packages (like 32-bit packages installed on 64-bit systems). This is because aptitude cannot handle conflicting dependencies in multiarch packages (that's what the bug is about), and the default behavior of ppa-purge is to use aptitude to downgrade packages.\nFortunately, ppa-purge accepts the -i flag which causes it to prefer apt-get to aptitude as its backend. As documented in the bug report, using apt-get is an effective alternative to manually invoking aptitude, so running ppa-purge with the -i flag should be an effective workaround for removing/downgrading all packages provided by a PPA, including multiarch packages.\nHow To Do It\nHere's the syntax:\nsudo ppa-purge -i ppa:ppaowner/ppaname\nAs usual (same as when the -i flag is not used):\n\n\n*\n\n*ppaowner is replaced with the owner of the PPA.\n\n*/ppaname is optional. If present, ppaname is replaced with the name of the PPA. If not, it defaults to ppa.\n\n\nFor example, suppose I had the PPA for unstable builds of qBittorrent installed, and I wanted to remove it completely, automatically downgrading qBittorrent to whatever version is available through my other software sources using apt-get behind the scenes instead of aptitude. Then I would run:\nsudo ppa-purge -i ppa:hydr0g3n/qbittorrent-unstable\n\nWhere It's Documented\nFor some reason, a few useful options for ppa-purge are not documented in its manual page, including -i. But you can get information about them by running ppa-purge -h (or just ppa-purge with no arguments):\nek@Del:~$ ppa-purge -h\nUsage: sudo ppa-purge [options] <ppa:ppaowner>[/ppaname]\n\nppa-purge will reset all packages from a PPA to the standard\nversions released for your distribution.\n\nOptions:\n    -p [ppaname]        PPA name to be disabled (default: ppa)\n    -s [host]       Repository server (default: ppa.launchpad.net)\n    -d [distribution]   Override the default distribution choice.\n    -y          Pass -y --force-yes to apt-get or -y to aptitude\n    -i          Reverse preference of apt-get upon aptitude.\n    -h          Display this help text\n\nExample usage commands:\n    sudo ppa-purge xorg-edgers\n    will remove https://launchpad.net/~xorg-edgers/+archive/ppa\n\n    sudo ppa-purge -p xorg-testing sarvatt\n    will remove https://launchpad.net/~sarvatt/+archive/xorg-testing\n\n    sudo ppa-purge ppa:ubuntu-x-swat/x-updates\n    will remove https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-x-swat/+archive/x-updates\n\nNotice: If ppa-purge fails for some reason and you wish to try again,\n(For example: you left synaptic open while attempting to run it) simply\nuncomment the PPA from your sources, run apt-get update and try again.\n\n\"Reverse preference of apt-get upon aptitude\" is a bit cryptic. By looking at the relevant piece of the source code (ppa-purge is just a shell script, after all), we can see that this means that the default behavior is to prefer aptitude to apt-get, and the -i flag reverses this preference.\n\nA: This script can list all packages from a particular server/branch (modifying the two declared variables):\n#!/bin/bash\n\nserver=\"http://it.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/\"\nbranch=\"maverick-updates/main\"\n\napt-cache policy $(dpkg -l | awk 'NR >= 6 { print $2 }') |\n  awk -v server=\"$server\" -v branch=\"$branch\" \\\n    '/^[^ ]/      { split($1, a, \":\"); pkg = a[1] }\n    nextline == 1 { nextline = 0; if ($2 == server && $3 == branch) print pkg }\n    /\\*\\*\\*/      { nextline = 1 }'\n\nif you need to list all packages not coming from a particular server, independently from the branch, replace the next-to-last line with:\nnextline == 1 { nextline = 0; if ($2 != server) print pkg }\n\n\nA: I found use of ppa-purge to be difficult.\nOpen Synaptic Package Manager under System, then select Settings, Repositories.\nRemove the ones you don't want.\nDone!\n", "Q: Which backend does Cairo use on Ubuntu?

I'm about to purchase a laptop with this graphics card (cheap deal) but I read that ATI cards have issues or may even not work with Natty. Is this true? Is there a way to fix the eventual problem? Are proprietary drivers needed or the included drivers will do fine? Thanks a lot for your advice, if I get the laptop and can't run Unity, it would be pretty much a waste of money to me.\n\nA: I am typing this on a laptop with a mobility radeon 4200.  It is an AMD Nile chipset, and as of Natty, everything except wireless works out of the box.  I had to upgrade to a kernel-ppa for 2.6.39, and then that also worked out of the box.  in 2.6.39, unfortunately, the proprietary drivers do not seem to install.  The open source drivers for the graphics card work, though at reduced performance and higher operating temperature.   When I play Minecraft, it gets uncomfortably hot.   I got an auxillary (25$) USB external cooler (two fans) for my laptop which has solved the problem for me for now.   I hope that oneiric will either work with the proprietary drivers, or have much improved open ones.   My laptop is 11.6 inches, very compact.

The classic netbook interface was available in Ubuntu's software repositories as an option.\nBecause Ubuntu's desktop edition has moved to the same Unity interface as the netbook edition, starting with Ubuntu 11.04 the netbook edition has been merged into the desktop edition.\n\n\nHere is a post from canonical blog which explains more:\nUbuntu Netbook Edition folded into Ubuntu for next release\n\nOne of the benefits of the direction that’s been taken with the next release of Ubuntu is that there is no longer a need for a separate netbook edition. The introduction of the new shell for Ubuntu means that we have a user interface that works equally well whatever the form factor of the PC. And the underlying technology works on a range of architectures including those common in netbook, notebooks, desktops or whatever you choose to run it on.

Download the Kubuntu iso if you're using Kubuntu (KDE)\n\n*Mount the using:\nsudo mount -o loop ubuntu-11.04-alternate-amd64.iso /media/cdrom\n\nif you're using KDE:\nsudo mount -o loop kubuntu-11.04-alternate-amd64.iso /media/cdrom\n\n\n*Start the installer by executing:\ngksu /media/cdrom/cdromupgrade\n\nif you're using Kubuntu:\nkdesudo /media/cdrom/cdromupgrade\n\n\nA: You'll need at least a computer which has a decent internet connection to download Ubuntu 11.04 ISO, once you're done downloading the LiveCD image, you can create a bootable flash drive from the image using popular tools like UNetbootin or Universal USB Installer and once you create a bootable flash drive, you can use it to upgrade all your computers running Ubuntu 10.10. You'll be able to make clean install of 11.04 or will be able to upgrade, thus keeping all your files safe. Obviously, you're computers should be able to boot from flashdrive, which largely depends on BIOS settings of your computers.\n", "Q: Increasing ubuntu partition space I have a laptop configured with dual boot (Ubuntu and win7). Partition in which Ubuntu in installed is running out of space(alloted only 15 GB space earlier).I want to use one of my empty partition for Ubuntu. As far as I know I think I have two option to do that to increase the Ubuntu partition size first is to merg that free partition using gparted into it, but that will take lots of time since that free partition is located to the left of Ubuntu partition (comes before on disk addressing space) so gparted will have to shift whole 15 GB of existing data in Ubuntu partition towards left. Other option is to export one of my root director like /usr(or other that consumes lots of space) to that partition.\nSo, I have following questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Which option is safe, efficient and comfortable.\n\n*If I were to export one of root dir(like /usr ) which one should I export and HOW. I think /usr should be the one since user programs are installed in it which constitute major portion of space.\n\n*Any other better way of doing this??\n\n\nA: You should move your /home directory to the other partition.

I just installed Natty on my laptop and I noted that my Tomboy applet is missing.\nI click over panel and choose Add to panel to try find it but it isn't there.\nAre there some way to restore this applet? I like it so much!\n\nA: I'm making the assumption you are running the Unity Interface - if you are using the classic Gnome interface then the following doesnt apply to you.\nIn Unity, all the previous Gnome Panel applets will not work - except if they were Application Indicators.  Unity doesnt allow you to \"right click\" and add to Panel anymore.\nIf you start Tom-Boy from the Dash (click the top left 'circle of friends' icon and search from Tom) you should hopefully see the new Tom-Boy Application Indicator displayed in the top-left of the screen.\nAdd Tom-Boy to the \"Startup Applications\" so that the Application Indicator is started when you next login.\n\nA: Just running Tomboy should load it in the indicator area (it's not an old applet so it doesn't show up in that right click menu anymore):\n\n\nA: Tomboy is not anymore a panel applet (you won't find it in \"Add to Panel\"), but it will provide an applet in the Indicator area once launched (ALT+F2 \"tomboy\").\nSo, if you need the new tomboy applet to be loaded automatically in the Indicator area, you'll need to go to \"System/Preferences/Startup Applications\" and then \"Add\", Name: \"Tomboy\", Command: \"tomboy\".\nThis applies to Gnome Desktop AND Unity.\nThis full solution was already provided in previous answer, but was spread into several answer and comments.\n", "Q: Dropbox gone from indicator area after upgrade to 11.04 I upgraded from 10.10 to 11.04 today, so I'm using Unity now, and Dropbox has disappeared from the indicator area.

Why can I only see terminal? Tonight I upgraded to 11.04. Problems. Once I had finished the upgrade, I restarted my computer as it told me too. When I got past the ubuntu 11.04 (purple background orange dots), it simply went to the terminal and asked me to log in. I tried to restart the X server with \"sudo service gdm restart\" but no display popped up. I happened to have a few NVIDIA drivers in my downloads file also so I gave these a try, but the \"install script\" failed. \nAfter all this I booted Ubuntu in graphic failsafe mode. I then decided to see what would happen if I removed the proprietary driver. Upon doing this and rebooting my Ubuntu booted into graphical mode \"yay!\". So without the Nvidia drivers I can finally see something other than terminal, but, I need those NVIDIA drivers for my work. So what can I do? I have tried installing the new NVIDIA linux drivers from the NVIDIA website, and have tried Installing the recommended driver via \"additional drivers\", but both have resulted in my being stuck in terminal.\nIf you can help or give me some advice PLEASE DO! I am really in a very bad situation...\n\nA: I also had a problem with nvidia drivers, and have done everything i could find (also in the other answers):\n\n\n*\n\n*remove the previously installed drivers and install again\n\n*booting through failsafeX and activating the driver\n\n*using the previous driver (173)\n\n*i added UNITY_FORCE_START=1 to /etc/environment as mentioned here (as GeForce 7300/7400 are blacklisted, but i have a GeForce Go 7100)\n\n\nBut it all kept failing. So, last resort (I should have thought of it earlier), I investigated the X-logfiles. Inside my /var/log/Xorg.0.log I found that nvidia had problems allocating the memory:\n[    14.055] (EE) NVIDIA(0): Failed to allocate primary buffer: out of memory.\n[    14.055] (EE) NVIDIA(0):  *** Aborting ***\n\nApparently this is a known bug, and i had to do the following to fix this:\n\n\n*\n\n*edit /etc/default/grub\n\n*find the option GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX and add nopat, so for me this looked like\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=\"nopat\"\n\n*run sudo update-grub \nAnd then, finally, everything worked fine for me :)\nHope this helps.\n\nA: You will need to boot into recovery mode, then issue apt-get remove --purge nvidia-current on the root terminal, followed by apt-get install nvidia-current - to rebuild the nvidia driver for the new kernel. I had this problem as well when I upgraded.\nPlease do not install the drivers from nVidia's website btw! You could cause serious trouble if you then try to install the recommended driver later without cleanly removing the previous one.\nEdit:\nYou will need to run these commands from a terminal. I cannot guarantee a perfect result, since I am going based on what I've found via the internet and from memory.\nThe problem you are getting is caused by having differing user mode components and kernel modules. To fix it, the nvidia kernel module has to be rebuilt. This is supposed to happen on reboot, but it often does not.\nFirst you need to install the linux kernel headers:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo apt-get install linux-headers-generic\nThen you will need to run dkms to remove the old nvidia kernel module:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo dkms remove nvidia\nThen run:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo apt-get install nvidia-current\n\n*this should make it install correctly, so all you need to do is run sudo nvidia-xconfig and reboot.\n\n*If you still get an error about the module version, run: sudo dkms build nvidia\nThis should solve the problem.\nSorry if things are a little confusing, I tried to put back together the process I had to use to the best of my memory :)! If you run into problems don't hesitate to let me know (and if anyone spots any problems with the instructions please let me know ASAP)!!!!\n\nUpdate:\nI found another possible cause. Nouveau might not have been blacklisted, and nvidia-current may not have placed itself in the .conf file that is used to choose your display driver. Here is how to fix it:\nNB:\nBefore you continue, ensure that you have the nvidia-current driver from the repositories. Downloading the driver from nvidia's website can cause problems later, as it does not use the debian package format and leaves things behind that can conflict with later installations. So make sure you clear any traces of it first, and then install the standard driver from the Ubuntu repos. If you do not, you will get a driver mismatch, and this fix will be pointless.\n\n*\n\n*If you are stuck on the console, log in and install the nouveau X.org driver: sudo apt-get install xserver-xorg-video-nouveau\n\n*Restart your computer (you will have working graphics, yay! But this is temporary).\n\n*Open gedit as root: gksu gedit.\n\n*From gedit open /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf.\n\n*Add this line at the bottom: blacklist nouveau.\n\n*Save the file, and open /etc/modprobe.d/nvidia-graphics-drivers.conf.\n\n*\n\n*Add these lines:\n\nblacklist nouveau\n  blacklist lbm-nouveau\n  blacklist nvidia-173\n  blacklist nvidia-96\n  alias nvidia nvidia-current  \n  \n  \n*Now save this file, and close gedit.\n  \n*Run:\n  \n*\n  \n*sudo nvidia-xconfig,\n  \n*and then:\n  \n*sudo apt-get remove xserver-xorg-video-nouveau,\n  \n*followed by:\n  \n*sudo shutdown -r now.\n  \n  \n*When your system restarts, you should have working nvidia drivers.\n  \n  By the way, this problem of not blacklisting nouveau seems to exist in the newer drivers (nvidia-current), so I would suggest after fixing the problem, that you wait for an update on this bug (I am going to report the bug soon).\n\nAlternate solution:\nIf you did install the NVIDIA drivers from their web site, then you must boot into a text terminal, (hold  at boot to see grub menu and select 'recovery' mode of the kernel version that last worked with the NVIDIA drivers, and select the command line as root option)  \nThen run the original NVIDIA install shell script you ran to install the NVIDIA drivers from their website. e.g. sudo ./NVIDIA-Linux-x86-290.10.run --uninstall. (Your version may differ.) \nYou won't need to run the \"sudo dkms remove nvidia\" command, as this doesn't apply for your case.\n\nA: My 11.04 upgrade also booted only to a terminal window.  Then I found this site.  I started doing what  Roland Taylor recommended, first I did \nsudo apt-get install linux-headers-generic\n\nThen I tried to do : \nsudo dkms remove nvidia \n\nBut it failed complaining that the command was was not complete, that I needed -m and -v and the version \nI was going to retry but I noticed that the screen had log info from the first command noting that it had install ed the nvidia-current when I installed the headers-generic,  so I thought, I wonder what it will do if I reboot now?   So I did and the X desktop came up fine. So only one command fixed my installation issue.\n\nA: Notice the kernel below is pointing to a previous Ubuntu release.  The new kernel with Ubuntu 11.10 is 3.0.0.12.  I had the same issue with being put in command mode and Xserver failing while not being able to find nvidia_173 driver.  I then realized that the upgrade didn't update my MBR to point to 3.0.0.12.  I used EasyBCD to update the file, rebooted, and all was fine.  These kinds of driver failures can happen when they are at mixed levels, of course.  My advice, after upgrading, make sure you are executing the new kernel, initrd, vmlinuz, ...what have you. \nDKMS make.log for nvidia-current-270.41.06 for kernel 2.6.38-8-generic (x86_64)\nSat May 14 20:48:39 EDT 2011\n\nThe C compiler 'cc' does not appear to be able to\ncreate executables.  Please make sure you have \nyour Linux distribution's gcc and libc development\npackages installed.\n\n*** Failed CC sanity check. Bailing out! ***\n\nmake: *** [select_makefile] Error 1\n\nI figured out that the cc (alias for gcc) used in my /usr/bin was not the same version as the gcc found within that same directory regardless of all the dev packages that were already installed on my machine. I had to make a symbolic link to point to the gcc file.\nsudo mv /usr/bin/cc /usr/bin/cc.old\nsudo ln -s /usr/bin/gcc /usr/bin/cc\n\nAfter that, reinstalling the nvidia-current package did the trick for me.\nRegards\n\nA: This is why I always recommend installing Ubuntu as a clean install instead of doing an upgrade. This is just my opinion but I have always had some problem or other when doing upgrades. No problems when doing a clean install.\nFor what I have read over the other answers you have installed the Nvidia Driver from the Nvidia Site. Even though it works good and etc.. DO NOT DO IT!. The one that comes in the ubuntu repositories has been tested and that is the one recommend.\nIn your case you will need to do several things.\nStep 1 - Uninstall the nvidia driver you install and never again install it. It will save you from having THAT specific problem that...ehem....somebody also had it (Me ;) ) you also need to remove the modules from it and whatever configuration files it leaves behind. If am not mistaken, then nvidia drivers from Nvidia web site have an uninstall binary. Run that and make sure there is no other nvidia files left behing.\nUPDATED - To uninstall an Nvidia Driver installed from the Nvidia Site you might have one of several options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Some suggest to uninstall using the same installer.\nExample: NVIDIA-Linux-x86-1.0-8178.run --uninstall\n\n*Others suggest to use the Nvidia Installer.\nExample: nvidia-installer --uninstall\nTIP - Try to type --help at the end of the Nvidia Binary Executable to see if it shows some help. Pages like https://help.ubuntu.com/community/NvidiaManual And http://www.nvnews.net/vbulletin/showthread.php?t=83678 give an idea of how to uninstall the Nvidia Driver from the Nvidia Site.\nStep 2 - Reboot and check that you NOTHING left from nvidia. Delete the xorg.conf file since you will be making a new one soon enough. Reboot.\nStep 3 - Install the recommended Nvidia drivers. sudo apt-get install nvidia-current or sudo apt-get reinstall nvidia-current (If you already had it installed. I would recommend unistall then installing it again.)\nStep 4 - CREATE the xorg.conf file for the Nvidia recommended driver. nvidia-xconfig. This will create the xorg.con file with the options needed for your nvidia video card. Reboot again.\nUp to this step I would need feedback if you had any problem. For a more general solution please feel free to read this guide: How do I install the Nvidia drivers?\n\nA: This worked for me.\n1) Shift to the F1 Terminal, by pressing Ctrl+Alt+F1.\n2) Run the following commands.\nsudo /etc/gdm stop\nsudo apt-get install linux-headers-$(uname -r) linux-image-$(uname -r)\nwget -O /tmp/nvidia.run http://us.download.nvidia.com/XFree86/Linux-x86/280.13/NVIDIA-Linux-x86-280.13.run\n# Make sure to allow the script to uninstall all existing drivers.\nsudo sh /tmp/nvidia.run\nsudo /etc/gdm start\n\n\nA: For anyone also having this issue, ensure that Optimus (Nvidia's graphics card switching technology) is disabled in the BIOS.\n", "Q: Why isn't CompizConfigSettings Manager installed along side Unity?

Everything I read said that the GNOME 3 PPA for Natty would be very experimental, cause sudden death, etc until April 28th.  Well, today is April 28th, so if I start using GNOME 3 from the PPA will it work entirely correctly now?\n\nA: I read (source) that GNOME 3 will break Unity in 11.04 and the issue won't be fixed until 11.10.\nIf you don't mind losing Unity, there probably is a way to get GNOME 3 working correctly but it definitively won't be painless (as there is no official support). \nIf you want to experience GNOME 3 now, I suggest you check out Fedora 15 (currently in beta).\n\nA: The Desktop Team has been very busy getting Ubuntu 11.04 out the door. The transition to Gnome 3 is very big and there has not been sufficient time or attention put into the Gnome3 PPA so it is still experimental and not recommended for use.\nIn other words, installing the PPA and upgrading your system will definitely result in you having various issues even in Unity. The gsettings migration also causes many integration issues. I have previously lost work because of gnome-power-manager problems when the computer auto shut off because I was unaware that my laptop had become unplugged 2 hours previous.\nDo not even attempt to use the PPA unless you are very familiar with how ppa-purge works.\nFor a smooth Gnome 3 experience on Ubuntu, wait 6 months for Ubuntu 11.10. The PPA may get better in the next few weeks but there are limits to what can be accomplished in a PPA.\n\nA: It is possible to get Gnome3 working in Ubuntu 11.04(Unity, Ubuntu Classic and etc will not be available after install). Problem will arise when you will try to log in after the install. Not everybody is getting into trouble with it though, but some people do.\nAnother desktop environment should be installed like LXDE and then you should log in with installed desktop environment once, and then after that you can start using Gnome 3\nFew articles that could be of a good use if you want to experiment\nArticle that refered Me here\nGood article if you want to experiment with your system\nI tried to install Gnome3 on my own and broke system twice but in the end I got it working, only the problem was that my video card is not supported by Gnome3, so make sure you have right graphics also, I went back to Ubuntu classic by reinstalling system PPA-PURGE did not help when tried to downgrade to previous gnome version. \nMaybe with a bit more time there will be a solution, could not find it for now\nGood Luck!\n", "Q: Resilience of Btrfs inside RAID5 Btrfs currently lacks fsck, risking corruption if there's a power failure.  To what extent, if at all, would creating a btrfs filesystem within a RAID5 array mitigate this?\n\nA: AFAIK it would make no difference. \nRAID is an abstraction layer for physical disks, it makes multiple disks/partitions look like a single \"block device\" to the file system. Some RAID levels (including RAID1 and RAID5) can handle physical disk failures transparently: Remove a disk, and for the file system it looks like nothing has changed.\nBut the file system works on top of the \"block device\" abstraction layer. Using a RAID5 as the block device helps dealing with physical disk failures, but it does nothing for the file system itself, so the risk of file system corruption remains the same.\nRAID blocks (mdadm 'chunks' with default size 64kB) differ from file system blocks (ext4 default size 4kB) and are designed to detect a different kind of corruption. \nRAID5 works by splitting data from the file system and writing one chunk to each of N-1 disks and a checksum to the Nth disk. RAID5 is designed to detect \"corrupt data\" in the sense of bad sectors, in which case the original can be restored from the checksum and the N-2 remaining good chunks. \nBut if the FS updates the metadata and dies before it has time to write the files, the file system may be corrupt without the RAID being any wiser: What was written to disk is the same as what is read back from disk, as evidenced by the checksums matching. The RAID cannot know that important pieces are missing from the perspective of a higher level application.\nSee this paper (pdf) for examples of corruption that goes undetected by RAID. In the context of file system corruption, I guess \"torn writes\" (only some of the data that were supposed to be written actually are) is particularly relevant.\n\nA: Linux software RAID5 would actually make the power failure situation worse - much worse - for the reason already addressed. Even on ext3/4, replaying the journal after a power failure will not fix the RAID5 inconsistency which invariably arises due to the software RAID not having a nonvolatile \"journal\" of its own to play back. The result is corruption of not only user data but also filesystem data in the event of a power failure during a write operation. Dedicated hardware RAID controllers with battery-backed cache do not suffer from this, but that still doesn't make up for the lack of being able to run fsck on btrfs.\nIf you care about your data integrity then do not run btrfs without an fsck tool, and do not run RAID5 (or any parity RAID level) without nonvolatile cache or a UPS.\n\nA: When a disk of RAID5/6 fails, the whole I/O subsystem becomes temporarily stuck as kernel tries to gain control on the failed drive, resetting SATA bus or the drive. The delay might take tens of seconds, that somehow affect the BTRFS to get corrupted, beyond recovery.\nSee MDRAID disk failure causes BTRFS corruption kernel bug.\n", "Q: Is there a Gmail notifier that works with multiple accounts?

After authentication, any command execution is forbidden, so I cannot SSH directly in, I need to get directly into the SFTP subsystem.\nFor instance.\nssh -N user@example.com works fine, except I can't SFTP anything.\nHowever, I can do sftp user@example.com just fine.\nProblem: I need to automate this, the authentication is keyboard-interactive, not key-based. I don't own the server I'm connecting to, they simply said \"Here's the password, upload the files every week.\" And nobody over there knows anything about keys or stuff like that. \nsftp -b Batch scripts won't allow keyboard interactive auth.\nI'm sick of manually uploading the file. They sent the 8-charecter password over unencrypted email and it contains 3 of the same numbers at the end and one dictionary word (ie \"Words777\") -- lets pretend security really isn't an issue here.\nCan I make the SSH key from just the password? Remember, I don't have access to the other server. Can I script this some way? I've attempted using different packages, and even rsync to do the upload, but they all want to access SSH directly instead of directly getting into the SFTP subsystem.\n\nA: I think that if you create a ssh key without protecting it with a \"passphrase\", you can skip the keyboard interactive part and thus easily create the upload script you need. See for example here :\nssh-keygen -t rsa -C \"Your Name\" -f your_key\nThis will create the necessary files, you then just have to copy the public one (*.pub) on the remote server.\n\nA: Install Expect that lets you script for situations like this.\nsudo apt-get install expect\nSet up a shell script\n#!/bin/bash\nHOST=\"\"\nUSER=\"\"\nPASS=\"\"\n\n# Sorry for the offensive \"assword\", it's to cope with \"Password\" and \"password\".\n\nVAR=$(expect -c \"\n  spawn sftp $USER@$HOST\n\n  expect \\\"assword:\\\"\n  send \\\"$PASS\\r\\\"\n\n  expect \\\"\\\\\\\\$\\\"\n  send \\\"ls\\r\\\"\n\n  expect -re \\\"$USER.*\\\"\n  send \\\"exit\\\"\n\")\n\necho \"===============\"\necho \"$VAR\"\n\n\nA: Use Socat.\nExample:\n(sleep 2; echo password) | socat - EXEC: \"sftp -o batchmode=no -o PubkeyAuthentication=no -b batchfile user@host\",pty,setsid,ctty\n\n", "Q: How can I put the Launcher on the other display? When I plug an external monitor into my laptop, the laptop screen is still considered my primary display. Since my laptop is on the right of my external monitor, I now have the Launcher sort of \"in the middle\". \nHow do I get the Launcher and the BFB onto my external monitor?\n\nA: currently there is no way to chose which monitor the launcher shows up on. there is an open bug about this issue on launchpad.\n\nA: There are a couple of workarounds though (including one from the bug Alex mentioned) that worked for me.\nInitially, I was using the open source \"radeon\" driver and this worked:\n\n\n*\n\n*Edit the file ~/.config/monitors.xml\n\n*You should see configurations listed for both displays.  Find the \"output\" section for the display you want to make primary and look for: <primary>no</primary> and change it to <primary>yes</primary>.\n\n*Log out of Unity (or reboot) and log back in.\n\n\nThis, however, did not work for me after I switched to the proprietary \"fglrx\" driver.  Thankfully I found another workaround: xrandr\n\n\n*\n\n*run xrandr | grep \" connected \".  This will give you the names of your connected displays.  You should be able to distinguish which display is external from the resolution xrandr reports.

Unity won't run on my new Ubuntu 11.04 install (with a Nvidia GeForce GO 7400). Ubuntu classic desktop works though, I tried all different drivers provided in the repositories. \nDoing System → Administration → Additional Drivers gives me a warning : \n\nThis driver is activated but not currently in use.\n\nI even tried the Nvidia driver from the official Homepage.\nAfter some googling, I found the tool /usr/lib/nux/unity_support_test -p which tells me that my card is blacklisted. The other tests show a green yes.\nIs this a bug? Or is my card too old which would be pretty surprising for me :P ?\nThanks.\n\nA: Just for reference, here's the bug report about this issue.\nAnother option you've got is to use the experimental 3D support with the open source nouveau driver. It's probably slower than the proprietary nvidia driver, but it's been working great for me.\nIn order to install it, just open the application dash with the Super+A key combination, start typing 'jockey' without the quotes and select the Additional Drivers result. This will start the jockey-gtk application, where you can select to install the nouveau driver with experimental 3D support.\nYou'll still need to force unity to run by adding UNITY_FORCE_START=1 to /etc/environment, as explained in the other answer\n\nA: We blacklisted Geforce Go 7300/7400 because of some freezes at startup with the \"nvidia-current\" driver.\nIt seems that unity 3D can run with the \"nvidia 173\" driver with those card.

For most people the update process will work seamlessly.\nThere are however always risks. A driver in the new version could be not working as good with your hardware as the previous version. Or something in the upgrade process could be going wrong.\nFor package conflicts you don't have to worry. If they occur, the upgrade will just stop and restore your system.\nIf you are talking about a great number of pc's (so, in a company) it is off course smart to test it on your hardware configurations and in your environment instead of blindly updating the first day.\n\nA: Usually upgrades worked fine for me but it's always possible that there are some problems, especially if you are using a lot of 3rd party software (like PPAs). \nSome things that could help to minimise trouble: \n\n\n*\n\n*See the \"Known Issues\" section of the release notes for known problems\n\n*Before upgrading use a live system to check for hardware compatibility problems\n\n*Make a system backup before you upgrade so you can easily go back if you don't like the new version\n\n*Usually there are a lot of bug fix updates during the first few weeks after a release.

Are there any alternatives to Microsoft Office Visio for Ubuntu?\n\nA: In terms of online solutions, including those already mentioned in this thread, there's\n\n*\n\n*Lucidchart\n\n*diagrams.net\n\n*Gliffy\n\n*Cacoo\n\n*Creately\n\nA: Many of the suggestions in other answers are good stand-ins for Visio for general diagramming. One gap I found was the lack of a decent set of network equipment symbols like those found in Visio. So I jumped in and built a set for OpenOffice/LibreOffice, now shipping in Fedora in the vrt-network-equipment package. It's also available to download here if you just want the OO/LibO extension.\nEdit: Now also added to extensions.libreoffice.org and extensions.openoffice.org\n\n\nA: I believe a solution that has been completely overlooked for far too long is Visual Paradigm. It's closed source, but it has a free community edition (non-commercial use) and is very stable and polished. Also, the UML only commercial license is only $99.\n\nA: I especially like yEd.\nDIA is unusable in comparison. I still wonder how I managed to document my Bachelor's Thesis using it. Try aligning objects in DIA, try creating any diagram so that it doesn't look like it was done in 3 minutes. \n\nA: Gliffy\nFor online use the site is here\nThere's also a Chrome app\n\nA: Install Dia  using the Ubuntu Software Centre.\n\nA: I would recommend Lucidchart as a robust alternative.  As far as I know, it's the only Linux-compatible option that will import and export Visio documents and stencils.\n\nA: I like LibreOffice Draw, its not as colorful as Visio, but works for me.\n\nA: I also like yEd very much: it has a straightforward approach to creating diagrams and lets you work efficiently after a very short while. The quality of the diagrams can be very high: there are advanced alignment functions, custom Icons can be imported (also from Visio) and there are various output formats available.\nHowever, yEd requires an Oracle Sun Java VM, which is not standard e.g. in Ubuntu 11.10. A solution is given in http://yed.yworks.com/support/qa/17. The easiest solution for me was to download and extract the \"Zipped yEd Jar\" Download and call the Oracle Sun Java explicitely, like:\n<path_to_Oracle_Java>/jre1.6.0_30/bin/java -jar <path_to_yEd>/yed-3.8/yed.jar\n\n\nA: I tried Visual Paradigm and I must say that it works beautifully. I am currently going for my BS on EET and i find it really handy and reliable.\n\nA: In addition to Dia, some good alternatives to Microsoft Visio are Libreoffice Draw, Calligra Flow and yED. There are some online alternatives but most of them have paid subscriptions. There is one online app which provides all the features for free though, its called draw.io. You can check it out!\nBtw, you can follow this guide for more information.\n\nA: PENCIL ROCKS! \nAnd it's compatible with Windows and Macs too. Check it out \n\nA: Inkscape\nI've primarily used Inkscape.  It's a very different UI, but it works well and it's a powerful tool.  Output can (depending on input) look as professional as necessary.\nIn Inkscape, use the \"Create diagram connector\". It has the option to \"Make connector avoid selected objects\". If you draw a connector, then select the object you want to avoid, edit the connector and finally click the button to avoid that object, you can use smart connectors that will not overlap the different elements of your box. In practice, I find the easiest way to do this is to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Draw a connector\n\n*Deselect the connector by clicking the object you want to avoid\n\n*Hold SHIFT and double-click the connector you just drew\n\n*Choose \"Make connector avoid selected objects\"\n\n\nAlso see this question and answers:  Nice network diagram editor? \nAbout the other recommendations\nI haven't used it much yet, but yEd looks very good. \nAlternatively, LibreOffice Draw is a popular piece of software, see other answers. One thing to note is that LibreOffice can now open Visio diagrams, and it lets you edit them.  It works well for simple diagrams, not as well for very Visio-idiosyncrasy-intensive ones.  It could still be usable with more effort, and in an environment with a lot of existing diagrams, this might be tolerable. \n\nA: I guess most web based solutions would match this answer. Of the web based solutions Creately offers a desktop solution that works on Linux. Although Flash haters might not like it.\n", "Q: Tried to upgrade from 10.04 -> 11.04, how to fix broken packages?

I've been looking around my project page but have been unable to find anything that looks like it will do this. Is there a 'file upload' mechanism built into Launchpad, or do I simply have to push them out as a branch of their own?\n\nA: Just push them as you would any regular file. I don't know of any file hosting mechanism on Launchpad, but then, it's not likely to find such a thing on any other code hosting site either.\nIf you create a new branch though, you can push just about any file type there.\n\nA: If you have a release in your project, you can upload files from the release page.\nI suppose you could create something like a \"documentation\" series with it's own releases, but if you're going to do that, you might as well just go the extra step and create a branch.\n", "Q: What is this \"slab\" that I am seeing in my session file?

How can I disable the Gnome and activate Unity instead?\n\nA: You should be able to activate the NVIDIA Driver in the Additional Drivers Window available when you login as Ubuntu Classic and navigate to System > Administrator > Additional Drivers\n\n\nA: Unity is a plugin for Compiz Fusion. It works well with Gnome, actually I don't think it works with anything rather than Gnome (someone might want to follow up on this).\nTo enable Unity, you have to enable the plugin in your Compiz settings. I'd suggest an app called CCSM (CompizConfig Settings Manager) -- a visual interface to Compiz settings. You can get it from the Software Center. Find Unity in the list and enable the plugin.\nUpdate: What if the plugin is already enabled?\nOkay what I'm gonna suggest is dangerous, but worked for me. Remember the command ccsm,  you might have to use that from the terminal to launch the manager again. Create a shortcut to your gnome terminal on your desktop (gnome-terminal). Go to the Compiz settings, go to Preferences and reset everything to defaults.\nYou might experience some display problems at this point, if your desktop gets unresponsive press Ctrl+Alt+1, login and type sudo service gdm restart, you might end up with a bare desktop without a single menu (I did). Run the terminal, run ccsm and enable the Unity plugin, it'll ask you about some conflicts, ask Compiz to resolve them and disable all plugins conflicting with Unity.\nWorked for me at least. Let me know how it goes ;) and good luck!\n\nA: If you are not seeing any available drivers, check your software sources and make sure that the main, universe, multiverse and restricted repos are enabled.\nThen, if you are comfortable in the terminal:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo apt-get install nvidia-current nvidia-settings\nIf you are more comfortable with synaptic/software center, you can open either one and search for the nvidia drivers, then install them (the packages name are nvidia-current and nvidia-settings).\n\nA: Log out and then you will see the GDM, click on the drop down menu and select Ubuntu Unity\n", "Q: How can I remove window shadows in Unity?

(pressing \"close\" from the menu bar doesn't help)\nI know I could go for running killall banshee but that's not an elegant solution. Any other ideas?

What I want is to quit Banshee totally, in order f.e. to start JACK audio server (and for example restart Banshee).\n\nA: You can't normally close banshee because Ubuntu Team has added a plug-in that integrates Banshee with the Unity desktop. You have to disable that plug-in in the \"Preferences\" menu to have an \"Exit\" option (Or CTRL+Q).\n1.- Go to Edit > Preferences\n2.- Go to the \"Plug-ins\" tab and disable the \"Sound Menu Integration\" plug-in.\n3.- To REALLY quit Banshee, press CTRL+Q or Go to Multimedia >Exit\nHope it helps.\nP.S. I don't like this kind of changes in Ubuntu, think that they should let the applications like they're released.

In October 2010, Otto Greenslade of the Canonical Design Team has published the so called Ubuntu emoticons in a post on the Design Blog.\nIn a post on OMG! Ubuntu! it was explained how you could set them for Pidgin, which is not the default IM client in Ubuntu 11.04 at least.\nHow can I do the same for Empathy so that the program uses this set of emoticons?\n\nA: In addition to the above reply, you can override empathy icon theme on a per user basis by installing the similarly named .png icons into ~/.local/share/icons/gnome/16x16/emotes\nWhen I tried this (using the android set of emoticons) I just closed the current chat window and the next time I used it the new theme was used, though a restart of empathy / gnome / ubuntu would ensure that they are picked up.\n\nA: First, download the .png version of the Ubuntu emoticons from the first link you have provided. Save them wherever you want, though here I will assume they will be in your Downloads folder. Extract after downloading by right-clicking the tar.gz you downloaded and selecting \"Extract here\".\nNext, hit Alt+F2 and type in gksudo nautilus. You will need to provide your password at the prompt. Once Nautilus starts, navigate to the /usr/share/icons/gnome/16x16/emotes directory. You should see all of the default emoticons if you go to the right place.\nOpen your extracted Ubuntu emoticons in another tab or window, and create a backup of the originals (right-clicking to copy and then pasting back into the same folder should create .png's renamed as copies, which should be enough). Delete the original icons you want to replace, then copy and paste the new icons into the emotes directory. Lastly, rename them so that they have the names of the original icons. To test, start an Empathy chat window and try typing in your new emotes!\nNote that the Ubuntu emoticons provided in that blog post are not a complete replacement for all of the default GNOME icons.

If you hover over the options, they will be visible for a moment, but it will them continue flickering.\nIf I immediately open Firefox upon login and touch nothing else (no menus, panels, or other windows), then I am able to use Firefox without the flickering, but the panels look fragmented and corrupted.\nHere are a couple screenshots, which I hope have turned out okay (since as soon as I take the screenshot everything will begin flickering :P).\nhttp://imgur.com/a/NBi0h\nNote that in this second image that the 'Take screenshot' window is actually no longer open--the image just sticks to the screen anyway.\nMy graphics card: \n\n00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation 82865G Integrated Graphics Controller (rev 02)\n\nThings I have tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*As soon as I saved the second screenshot, my whole machine froze up. After absolutely no response to anything after ~10 minutes, I unplugged the machine (shudder) and started it up again. Thankfully, Firefox saved my post, and I was able to submit it.\n\n*This flickering happens in Ubuntu Classic as well ,and menus flicker.\n\n*Adding the phrase \"i915.modeset=0\" immediately before \"quiet splash\" did stop the flickering. However, it also changed my Princeton monitor's resolution to 640x460. Should I follow the instructions here?\nNote: my monitor is marked as \"Unknown\" in the Monitor Settings window. There aren't any other resolutions available in the dropdown.\nI have succeeded in making the change persistent.

Dont worry though, you can try unity by installing Unity-2d through the Software Center.  \nMore of a problem though is the flickering with ubuntu classic.\nThis is a worth a try -\nReboot, immediately after booting press shift to display your grub. press e to edit the config of that kernel line. Find the line ending 'quiet splash'.  Edit that line so that is reads \"i915.modeset=0 quiet splash\" and press ctrl+x to boot.\ni.e. add the phrase \"i915.modeset=0\" immediately before \"quiet splash\"\nTo make this persistent (i.e. after each reboot) then do the following:\nIn a terminal type\nsudo nano /etc/default/grub\n\nfind the line\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash\"\nchange it to\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"i915.modeset=0 quiet splash\"\nType CTRL O to write the file\nType CTRL X to exit\nThen type\nsudo update-grub\n\n\nA: If you're running ubuntu 11.04 and have a 82855G, the only solution at the moment is to run the GUI in classic mode.\nIf you're running kubuntu, hit start (K) -> Computer -> System Preferences -> Desktop Effects    and disable them.\n", "Q: Problem mounting Drive I asked this  question earlier.

Root and home are ext4 partition format.\nWhat's the problem?\nHow can I fix it?\n\nA: Try editing the main GRUB configuration file (/etc/default/grub) and changing GRUB_TIMEOUT to a different value.\nOne way to edit the file is to run:\ngksu gedit /etc/default/grub\n\nYou can also try tapping or holding up/down keys right before Ubuntu starts up.\n\nA: I installed Natty onto a separate drive than Windows 7 (a USB hard-drive that I had been using for backup), and when I reboot there is no GRUB.  But when I choose boot options (on my Dell I press F12 during boot), then I can choose either my internal hard-drive or my USB hard-drive (amongst other options, of course); when I choose to boot to my USB hard-drive, I get GRUB!\nPerhaps if you installed Natty onto a different drive that Windows, you might need to choose that drive and THEN Natty, just as I do.\n\nA: After ObsessiveFOSS advice:\nFrom this link...\nStep 1: Boot from the ubuntu live cd and go to terminal\nType in terminal:\nsudo grub\ngrub> find /boot/grub/stage1\n\nThat should return your Ubuntu partition in the form of (hdX,Y), use that:\ngrub> root (hdX,Y)\ngrub> setup (hd0)\ngrub> quit\n\n(You don’t need to type the grub>  part.)\nThat has re-installed grub but you can no longer see Windows 7.\nStep 2.

Even in sound preferences, the hardware itself disappears and output is \"dummy sound\".\nIs there a way to prevent this from happening?\nWhat would be really good is if I could turn down the volume (or mute entirely) all the sounds on all other accounts on a per-user basis from my sound preferences without affecting whatever setting they have - essentially saying whenever user A is logged in, all sounds from user B's account are muted and anything from user C's account is at 50% while I can still have my own at full volume.\n\nA: Maybe a partial fix for your problem I found in an older Fedora thread about pulse audio:\n\"Pulseaudio - Multiple Users\"\nPost nr. 5 says:\n\nAs the main user, I copied /etc/pulse/default.pa to ~/.pulse/default.pa.

I frequently\nwant to have more than a dozen emacs windows open as I'm writing\ncode.  \nIn classic Ubuntu, I could easily choose which one I want\nfrom the name of the file in the bottom task bar, but this does not\nseem to have an equivalent in Unity.  When I have so many open,\nit's difficult to find which window I want.  For this, even the\n10.10 Unity was better because I could AltTab through and see their names; no more in 11.04.  It would be great if the new task bar had one emacs box (for example) covering all instances of emacs windows open.  Right click on the\nbox and have the option to see a list of the names of all open\ninstances.  \nPresently, the usefulness of right clicking on these\ntaskbar boxes seems very limited anyways.  I think a simple change\nof this nature would greatly improve Unity's utility.\nI already use multiple workspaces (6) and often have something like a terminal window and many emacs windows per workspace, and I'm already using keyboard shortcuts. So far, none of these get at the heart of the problem, I don't think an 'open file list' is a tall order.\nSuper+W does the exact opposite of what I'm suggesting. There are already too many windows open on a single workspace to easily find the one I'm looking for - viewing all windows on all workspaces just clutters the view even more.\nShift+Alt+&uparrow; does not help.  If I have a dozen emacs windows open on a single workspace, doing this shows all the open windows on the workspace all at once, but spaces them out and shrinks them down to little icons.  How am I supposed to figure out at first glance which one I want? They are indistinguishable.\n\nA: I've found a great plugin from compiz-plugins-extra, which is the Scale Window Title Filter.\n\n\n*\n\n*After enabling it, first you press Super+W which brings all candidate windows (I've tuned to showing only windows in current workspace).\n\n*Then just TYPE the keyword of the window you are looking for and confirm with Enter to go for it! \nIf you know exactly what you want, this is faster than any keyboard+mouse-selecting-and-confirming combination. In the best case, you can get exactly just the one result you expect.\nWoo-hoo, searching rocks!! :)\n\nA: First install compiz-plugins-extra .\nThen enable the scale mode addons in compiz using the Compiz Config Settings Manager, then restart unity (run unity in the run dialogue (alt+f2)).\nNow, when you have multiple windows open, you can type a part of the name of the window you want to narrow your search, while keeping the visual preview.\nNB:\nWhen I talk about searching, I'm referring to search from scale mode (which is what happens if you click on the icon of an application with multiple windows open, or hit super+W).\n\nA: Clicking on the the launcher icon of the application whose windows you want to view a second time will initiate a spread mode, where you can see all of the open windows for that application, and pick the the one you want. This also works via the keyboard shortcut for that application.\n\nA: super/windows key + W works for me so far.\n\nA: I'd suggest Alex Launi's answer, but with one tweak: enable Window Title Display.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open CompizConfig Settings Manager\n\n*Enable module called Text\n\n*Find module called Scale Addons\n\n*Switch to tab Appearance\n\n*Open the Window Title drop-down\n\n*Switch Window title display parameter to All windows. You might want to increase font size also.\n\n\nAfter this tweak the double-click on the launcher icon should suit your needs.\n\nA: A dozen windows is a lot. I'm also a professional programmer, and I'm usually happy with three terminals (one with a split vim session). \nHave you considered logically splitting your editors across multiple desktops? I have one desktop (number 4) dedicated to documentation, one dedicated to code/grepping/compiling (number 5), and one dedicated to testing (number 6). I have random access to each of them with hotkeys, which is faster than pointing and clicking or alt-tabbing. \n\nA: I would agree that making full use of the four workspaces that are there by default helps a lot.  You can move quickly between them using Ctrl+Alt+Arrow keys (you can also configure compiz to switch using the scroll-wheel of the mouse whenever the cursor is over the desktop).\nThere are three ways to view open windows (two are already mentioned): to view all instances of a single program, click on the corresponding launcher icon.  To view all open windows in the current workspace, you can use Shift+Alt+Up arrow.  To view all open windows on all workspaces, Super+W does the trick.\n\nA: Here's the makeshift solution I'm going with: start gnome-panel within Unity; right click and delete the top panel; configure the bottom panel however you like; add gnome-panel to the Startup Applications; then restart.  The top panel should be permanently deleted (since it overlaps the Unity top panel) and the bottom panel can show the open file list for the workspace. Now the bottom panel can exist in Unity - I like to make it retractable like the launcher.\n\nA: Instead of SUPER+W to expose all open application, you could try to hold SUPER, then you will see the little numbers in the launcher. When you hit the number of you application once you'll get to the most recent window. If you hit the number twice you'll get all (only) the windows of this application exposed. This helps for me because it reduces the amount of windows in the expose overview. But still: choosing the desired windows or document (imagine multiple Writer documents) is not as fast as it was with the taskbar. \n", "Q: Why isn't lo-menubar installed by default in LibreOffice? Will I face any problems by installing the lo-menubar to give libreoffice global menus in Natty?\nI'm wondering why it isn't installed by default.

I tried several times, but I was fighting with the stupid captcha applet.\nAnyway, I discovered that there was an old, manually installed Firefox 3.6 in /opt/firefox. This is what the icon was trying to start. I deleted that folder, then the icon wouldn't start anything.\nSo, I uninstalled and reinstalled FF 4 using aptitude. Then, I found that I could start FF 4 from the terminal, but the icon was still looking for /opt/firefox.\nI could not find out how to fix that in Unity, so I logged into Gnome Classic and changed the Properties of both the icon and the menu item for Firefox. Then, when I logged back into Unity, the icon worked.\nTim\n\nA: First method\nSuper+A, type system, click on System Settings -> Personal section -> Preferred Applications -> Internet tab -> Web Browser, choose Firefox Web Browser.\nSecond method\nAlt+F2, type firefox, hit ENTER, from menu Edit -> Preferences, Advanced -> General Tab -> System Defaults, click on Check Now, click on Yes, click on Close.\n", "Q: Dual screen different font resolution I am using ubuntu natty and a dual screen set up with my laptop screen 1280x800 and an external monitor with hdmi connection 1920x1080 both at 60hz refresh rate.

I am using Ubuntu Server 10.10 in a VirtualBox. I need to install a single GUI program (RubyMine) on it.\nI checked out installing ubuntu-desktop with apt-get, and it wants me to install 430 new packages (including OpenOffice). I installed the server in the first place to keep the install as clean as possible!\nHow do I do a minimal install of (all packages needed) to run that single GUI program?\nI created a file /etc/apt/apt.conf and added the following:\nAPT::Install-Recommends \"0\";\nAPT::Install-Suggests \"0\";\n\nBut sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop still says:\n0 upgraded, 430 newly installed, 1 to remove and 9 not upgraded.\nNeed to get 155MB of archives.\nAfter this operation, 542MB of additional disk space will be used.\nDo you want to continue [Y/n]? n\n\n\nA: You can install X without a complete desktop environment but to be upfront and honest, installing ubuntu-desktop is probably the quickest and config-free method of doing what you want.\nFor our media centre, I use a simple stack of: nodm → xserver-xorg → openbox. It's very raw but it allows me (with a bit of scripting) to have the system boot to X and then launch the media centre application (Boxee here). I could probably have gone without openbox but it's nice to have some sort of Window Manager just in case I do want to run something else.\nWhen I was doing it, I followed a whole raft of different documentation but the bulk of it is summed up here. In short you should be aiming to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install nodm, X, etc.\n\n*Configure nodm by telling it what user to run as (I do suggest creating a non-root user)\n\n*Create a ~/.xsession file to boot whatever application you want to be running. In my case this is:\n#!/bin/sh\n\nexec /home/oli/uberboxee\n\nYou'd just swap out /home/oli/uberboxee for your launcher.\nJust as a side note, if you install something that requires, for example, GTK, you'll find it might pull in a massive number of recommended packages. To keep things light, I strongly consider you run your apt-get installs with the --no-install-recommends flag.\nThe Low Memory System page on help.ubuntu.com is a good resource for finding alternatives to the Gnome desktop. Installing a desktop suite is going to bring a lot of stuff but it might save you a little bit of configuration.\n\nA: You just need to install a clean desktop environment, try Gnome or KDE for starters this will give you a graphical interface without the extra software each distribution is coming with.\n", "Q: How to remove \"Apps Available for Download\" from the applications lens?

I've got a 2nd generation Intel i5 processor with integrated graphics. In live usb mode, Ubuntu uses this one and Unity works fine.

Mounts disks in /media/\npmount /dev/sdb1\npumount /dev/sdb1\n\nNo sudo needed.\nReplace \"sdb1\" with your specific device path. For more information see the manpage:\npmount  (\"policy mount\") is a wrapper around the standard mount program\nwhich permits normal users to mount removable devices without a  match-\ning /etc/fstab entry.\n\npmount is invoked like this:\n\npmount device [ label ]\n\nThis  will  mount  device  to a directory below /media if policy is met\n(see below). If label is given, the mount point will  be  /media/label,\notherwise it will be /media/device.\n\n\nA: 1. Find what the drive is called\nYou'll need to know what the drive is called to mount it. To do that fire off one of the following (ranked in order of my preference):\nlsblk\nsudo blkid\nsudo fdisk -l\n\nYou're looking for a partition that should look something like: /dev/sdb1. The more disks you have the higher the letter this is likely to be. Anyway, find it and remember what it's called.\n2. Create a mount point (optional)\nThis needs to be mounted into the filesystem somewhere. You can usually use /mnt/ if you're being lazy and nothing else is mounted there but otherwise you'll want to create a new directory:\nsudo  mkdir /media/usb\n\n3. Mount!\nsudo mount /dev/sdb1 /media/usb\n\nWhen you're done, just fire off:\nsudo umount /media/usb\n\n\nThis answer is almost 6 years old and while the core of it still works, things like fdisk -l aren't the most user-friendly options. There are also new mechanisms in higher stacks for mounting devices in a sane and standard way which might not always be available.\nSo I've added some polish from the other answers. While you're reading this footnote and you're doing this on a desktop system, there definitely are  arguments for using udisksctl, per wecac's answer. This mounts in the same way the desktop does —creating your own /media/$USER/device directory— but I think there are still arguments for a static mountpoint, especially when you don't want the path to change.\nUdisks also relies on D-Bus, so might not be available everywhere.\n\nA: That's simple. When I want to use a usb drive in terminal I do this: \nCreate a folder in /media with:\nmkdir /media/mountDrive \n\nThis folder will be used for the mount point. Use this command:  \nsudo mount /dev/sdd1 /media/mountDrive \n\nsdd1 is the first partition of my USB. Then you can navigate to folder you already mounted with \ncd /media/mountDrive\n\nIf you want to list the files in drive you can use the ls command. \nTo unmount the drive you can use \nsudo umount /dev/sdd1\n\nNote that in my system the usb drive is /dev/sdd1, but in your system it may be something different. To find out what it is use the df command to see all disks connected at the present time.\n\nA: Use udisksctl from package=udisks2 (in both Ubuntu and Debian). Procedure is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Find the ID of the block device you want to mount, using lsblk:\nuser@machine:~$ lsblk\nNAME   MAJ:MIN RM   SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT\nsda      8:0    0   1.8T  0 disk\n├─sda1   8:1    0  19.1M  0 part /boot/efi\n├─sda2   8:2    0   1.8T  0 part\n└─sda3   8:3    0    16G  0 part [SWAP]\nsdb      8:16   0 931.5G  0 disk\n├─sdb1   8:17   0    37M  0 part\n├─sdb2   8:18   0  15.9G  0 part [SWAP]\n└─sdb3   8:19   0 915.7G  0 part /\nsdc      8:32   1  14.4G  0 disk\n└─sdc1   8:33   1  14.4G  0 part\nsdd      8:48   0   1.8T  0 disk\n└─sdd1   8:49   0   1.8T  0 part\n\nFrom its size, /dev/sdc1 seems to be the USB drive I want to mount.\n\n*Use udisksctl to mount the device. Note that -b == --block-device (to reduce typing) but I prefer long options for documentation:\nuser@machine:~$ udisksctl mount --block-device /dev/sdc1\n==== AUTHENTICATING FOR org.freedesktop.udisks2.filesystem-mount ===\nAuthentication is required to mount Kingston DT microDuo 3C (/dev/sdc1)\nMultiple identities can be used for authentication:\n 1.  XXXXX,,, (user)\n 2.  ,,, (YYYYY)\nChoose identity to authenticate as (1-2): 1\nPassword:\n==== AUTHENTICATION COMPLETE ===\nMounted /dev/sdc1 at /media/user/USBDRIVELABEL.\n\nAddressing Hans Deragon's comment below: you can also tell udisksctl to do --no-user-interaction. It does not attempt to authenticate the user, which usually \"just works\":\nuser@machine:~$ udisksctl mount --block-device /dev/sdc1 --no-user-interaction\n# possibly some complaining here about I/O charset or need to run `fsck`\nMounted /dev/sdc1 at /media/user/USBDRIVELABEL.\n\n\nA: In addition to using the standard mount command (which requires root) you can mount drives using udisks and dbus with your standard user.\nTo do this it is useful (but not required) to know a few things about the drive first:\n\n\n*\n\n*What device it is (i.e. /dev/sdb1)\n\n*what filesystem it uses.\n\n\nKnowing these you can use a simple command to mount a drive from the command line.\ngdbus call --system --dest org.freedesktop.UDisks --object-path /org/freedesktop/UDisks/devices/<device> --method org.freedesktop.UDisks.Device.FilesystemMount \"<filesystem>\" []\n\nthis call should echo the path it is mounted at if the mount succeeds. \nTo unmount drives mounted in this way you can run:\ngdbus call --system --dest org.freedesktop.UDisks --object-path /org/freedesktop/UDisks/devices/<device> --method org.freedesktop.UDisks.Device.FilesystemUnmount []\n\n\nN.B. the <device> is simply the end of the path to it. So for example if what you want to mount is at /dev/sdb2 then you would put sdb2 in place of <device>.\n\nIf you do not know which device it is or what filesystem it uses do not fear. You can easily print out all that information with this little command:\ngdbus introspect --system --dest org.freedesktop.UDisks --object-path /org/freedesktop/UDisks/devices --recurse --only-properties | grep -E \"(readonly .+ (IdLabel|IdType|Device(IsMounted|IsDrive|File) ).*|\\}|.*\\{)\"\n\nThis will print out something like this:\nnode /org/freedesktop/UDisks/devices {\n  node /org/freedesktop/UDisks/devices/sda {\n    interface org.freedesktop.UDisks.Device {\n        readonly s IdLabel = '';\n        readonly s IdType = '';\n        readonly s IdUsage = '';\n        readonly b DeviceIsMounted = false;\n        readonly s DeviceFile = '/dev/sda';\n    };\n  };\n  node /org/freedesktop/UDisks/devices/sda1 {\n    interface org.freedesktop.UDisks.Device {\n        readonly s IdLabel = 'SYSTEM';\n        readonly s IdType = 'ntfs';\n        readonly s IdUsage = 'filesystem';\n        readonly b DeviceIsMounted = false;\n        readonly s DeviceFile = '/dev/sda1';\n    };\n  };\n  node /org/freedesktop/UDisks/devices/sda2 {\n    interface org.freedesktop.UDisks.Device {\n        readonly s IdLabel = 'Windows7';\n        readonly s IdType = 'ntfs';\n        readonly s IdUsage = 'filesystem';\n        readonly b DeviceIsMounted = true;\n        readonly s DeviceFile = '/dev/sda2';\n    };\n  };\n  node /org/freedesktop/UDisks/devices/sda3 {\n    interface org.freedesktop.UDisks.Device {\n        readonly s IdLabel = 'Recovery';\n        readonly s IdType = 'ntfs';\n        readonly s IdUsage = 'filesystem';\n        readonly b DeviceIsMounted = false;\n        readonly s DeviceFile = '/dev/sda3';\n    };\n  };\n  node /org/freedesktop/UDisks/devices/sda4 {\n    interface org.freedesktop.UDisks.Device {\n        readonly s IdLabel = '';\n        readonly s IdType = '';\n        readonly s IdUsage = '';\n        readonly b DeviceIsMounted = false;\n        readonly s DeviceFile = '/dev/sda4';\n    };\n  };\n  node /org/freedesktop/UDisks/devices/sda5 {\n    interface org.freedesktop.UDisks.Device {\n        readonly s IdLabel = '';\n        readonly s IdType = 'ext4';\n        readonly s IdUsage = 'filesystem';\n        readonly b DeviceIsMounted = true;\n        readonly s DeviceFile = '/dev/sda5';\n    };\n  };\n  node /org/freedesktop/UDisks/devices/sda6 {\n    interface org.freedesktop.UDisks.Device {\n        readonly s IdLabel = '';\n        readonly s IdType = 'swap';\n        readonly s IdUsage = 'other';\n        readonly b DeviceIsMounted = false;\n        readonly s DeviceFile = '/dev/sda6';\n    };\n  };\n  node /org/freedesktop/UDisks/devices/sda7 {\n    interface org.freedesktop.UDisks.Device {\n        readonly s IdLabel = '';\n        readonly s IdType = 'ext4';\n        readonly s IdUsage = 'filesystem';\n        readonly b DeviceIsMounted = true;\n        readonly s DeviceFile = '/dev/sda7';\n    };\n  };\n  node /org/freedesktop/UDisks/devices/sdb {\n    interface org.freedesktop.UDisks.Device {\n        readonly s IdLabel = '';\n        readonly s IdType = '';\n        readonly s IdUsage = '';\n        readonly b DeviceIsMounted = false;\n        readonly s DeviceFile = '/dev/sdb';\n    };\n  };\n  node /org/freedesktop/UDisks/devices/sdb1 {\n    interface org.freedesktop.UDisks.Device {\n        readonly s IdLabel = 'USB DRIVE';\n        readonly s IdType = 'vfat';\n        readonly s IdUsage = 'filesystem';\n        readonly b DeviceIsMounted = false;\n        readonly s DeviceFile = '/dev/sdb1';\n    };\n  };\n  node /org/freedesktop/UDisks/devices/sr0 {\n    interface org.freedesktop.UDisks.Device {\n        readonly s IdLabel = '';\n        readonly s IdType = '';\n        readonly s IdUsage = '';\n        readonly b DeviceIsMounted = false;\n        readonly s DeviceFile = '/dev/sr0';\n    };\n  };\n};\n\nThose that have IdUsage = 'filesystem' may be mounted using the above command.\nThis means that, for example, if i wanted to mount the device 'USB DRIVE' i would run the command \ngdbus call --system --dest org.freedesktop.UDisks --object-path /org/freedesktop/UDisks/devices/sdb1 --method org.freedesktop.UDisks.Device.FilesystemMount \"vfat\" []\n\n\nThese commands all work using the dbus messaging system, the same way that Nautilus and other file managers auto-mount things. In these commands we are sending various objects (i.e. /org/freedesktop/... messages asking them to mount and unmount certain devices. They might or might not do this depending on the permissions one has been given in PolicyKit.\nUsing similar commands one can control almost every aspect of ones experience in Ubuntu and simulate most system programs and functions (i.e. shutdown, volume change, etc.).\n\nA: I will not add about how to mount the drive. However since the asker also asked what the best command to use to copy the data over, I will answer that since it was not answered as far as I can tell.\nI would recommend first creating a folder on the drive (even if it is empty) to back your stuff into to provide organization. Something along the lines of mkdir <mountpath>/mybackup should do it.\nSecond, I would use rsync to copy everything over. Do something along the lines of rsync -r ~/* <mountpoint>/mybackup. You can also use cp -r if you want, however, I have found that doing so doesn't do quite everything that you would expect all of the time.\n", "Q: Dual boot with Ubuntu 11.04, OpenSUSE 11.4 and/or Fedora 15 beta. Does the order matters? I'm planning to have an Ubuntu 11.4 / OpenSUSE 11.4 or maybe an Ubuntu 11.4 / Fedora 15 beta dual boot (or the three of them).\nWill they dual boot just after installation? or I have to install them in a certain order or do some special configuration?\n(Right now I'm using Ubuntu 10.10)\n\nA: Be careful with OpenSUSE - they still use GRUB as their bootloader, while Ubuntu uses GRUB2.  (As of 11.4 there is an option to go with GRUB2 however.)  If you're using Ubuntu as your primary OS and replace GRUB2 with GRUB during an OpenSUSE install, it might cause problems.  (At the very least, some of the command line structure is different, so it might make it hard to follow a how-to, for example.)\nI haven't done an install with 11.4 but I do have 11.3 installed on a second hard drive.  If they haven't made major changes, one of the options when installing OpenSUSE is to install no bootloader at all.  After the install you need to run sudo update-grub from Ubuntu to add OpenSUSE to the bootloader.  (This was the option I went with, since I wanted to keep Ubuntu's bootloader.)  The only downside to doing it this way is that whenever OpenSUSE updates their kernel, you have to update the grub manually (from within Ubuntu - at least that's the easiest way IMO).\nI think Fedora 15 uses GRUB2 as well; if you install Fedora second you'll get a Fedora theme for the bootloader but there's otherwise no difference.\n\nA: Fedora15 comes with Legacy Grub by default. Not, Grub2. I'm stuck in a similar problem.\nThe problem is solved now. TO answer your question directly. Install Ubuntu last. It will handle all the grub file editing and the lot automatically.\n\nA: Nope, the order won't matter. They all use GRUB as the default bootloader, so there is nothing to be written over like when dealing with Windows.\nYou can choose which one you want to boot up automatically in (or whether you want GRUB to wait and make you choose every startup) by configuring GRUB after the installations.\n\nA: One thing i'm sure... if you install openSUSE after install Ubuntu, you will miss the boot because of the Grub bootloader in opensuse don't work with Grub2 from Ubuntu, as it was mentioned upper by Fitzpatrick. I recommend you to install fedora instead of opensuse, and you will haven't any throuble with the Grub2 bootloader in your two SO (or 3 SO if you have Guindous running too). I did it, jejeje. Best regards. \n\nA: The order of installation needs to be Fedora then Ubuntu.\n", "Q: How can I remove the Trash icon from the Unity launcher? I would like to not show the trash icon at the bottom of the Unity launcher.\nIs this possible without having to recompile anything? :P\n\nA: Currently it's not possible. You should start a blueprint for this in Launchpad, so we can see it in future versions of Unity.\n\nA: I have found a way to visually make the trash icon disappear. The icon will still spatially be there. Make backups of the icon image if desired.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open a terminal.\n\n*type sudo -H nautilus\n\n*press enter\n\n*type \"trash\" into the search bar\n\n*There will be many pictures of the trash (full or empty) icon with the .svg extension. Select the second largest version of the trash icon and open it with inkscape. \n\n*Press select all (CtrlA) and then press the deletekey on your keyboard. Save and exit.\n\n*Do the same thing for the empty version/full version if you\nhave not already.\n\n*Reboot your computer.\n\n\nYou should then see that the trash icon has visually disappeared and if you mouse over its usual location at the bottom of the launcher, a flag should pop up saying \"Trash\" or \"Empty trash\" as usual.\n\nA: In the desktop interface, the Dash icon and the Trash icon use the top and bottom slots of the launcher, always. We have not allowed the removal of the Trash so that we can enable developers to trust that it will always be there, which means \"drag to the trash\" is always possible.\nIt might be worth considering relaxing the requirement that the trash always be on the bottom corner, allowing other icons to take that spot. A blueprint to that effect, discussing the consequences and solutions to issues that might arise, would be welcome.\n", "Q: Cannot get new job to run using /etc/crontab and /etc/cron.daily I want to run a script on a daily basis, and figured that I'd use the same setup that the other cron jobs are configured on this server - by placing the script in the /etc/cron.daily folder.\nHowever, the script was not run overnight - although others in the daily folder were (logs were rotated, etc). The script is owned by root (as are the original ones in there), and the permissions are set to 755 (as are the original ones in there) - and the script runs when called manually.\nI have found this related question Cron.hourly won't run but don't find the answers anywhere near satisfactory - sudo crontab -l tells me there is no crontab for root (although, I know I can created one), and it would make more sense to use the same method as the preinstalled jobs anyway rather than split cron configuration.\nAnyone able to point at something I might have missed?\nFor the record - the script filename is drupal\n\nA: Managed to work out how to do a bit of debugging by using run-parts -v /etc/cron.daily - and after a disabled the apt script (with its random upto 30 minute sleep) I found the error message for the new script:\nrun-parts: failed to exec /etc/cron.daily/drupal: Exec format error\nrun-parts: /etc/cron.daily/drupal exited with return code 1\n\nThis didn't turn up in the syslog though - which would have been helpful.\nThat's when I realised that I hadn't but a #!/bin/sh directive at the top of the script - fixed that, ran the run-parts command again, and all sorted.\n", "Q: \"Permission denied\" errors whe starting a single node cluster in Hadoop I'm working in Ubuntu 10.10 and am trying to start a single node cluster in Hadoop.\nhadoop@abraham-Dimension-3000:/usr/local/hadoop$ bin/start-all.sh\nmkdir: cannot create directory `/usr/local/hadoop/bin/../logs': Permission denied\nstarting namenode, logging to /usr/local/hadoop/bin/../logs/hadoop-hadoop-namenode-abraham-Dimension-3000.out\n/usr/local/hadoop/bin/hadoop-daemon.sh: line 117: /usr/local/hadoop/bin/../logs/hadoop-hadoop-namenode-abraham-Dimension-3000.out: No such file or directory\nhead: cannot open `/usr/local/hadoop/bin/../logs/hadoop-hadoop-namenode-abraham-Dimension-3000.out' for reading: No such file or directory\nlocalhost: mkdir: cannot create directory `/usr/local/hadoop/bin/../logs': Permission denied\nlocalhost: starting datanode, logging to /usr/local/hadoop/bin/../logs/hadoop-hadoop-datanode-abraham-Dimension-3000.out\nlocalhost: /usr/local/hadoop/bin/hadoop-daemon.sh: line 117: /usr/local/hadoop/bin/../logs/hadoop-hadoop-datanode-abraham-Dimension-3000.out: No such file or directory\nlocalhost: head: cannot open `/usr/local/hadoop/bin/../logs/hadoop-hadoop-datanode-abraham-Dimension-3000.out' for reading: No such file or directory\nlocalhost: mkdir: cannot create directory `/usr/local/hadoop/bin/../logs': Permission denied\nlocalhost: starting secondarynamenode, logging to /usr/local/hadoop/bin/../logs/hadoop-hadoop-secondarynamenode-abraham-Dimension-3000.out\nlocalhost: /usr/local/hadoop/bin/hadoop-daemon.sh: line 117: /usr/local/hadoop/bin/../logs/hadoop-hadoop-secondarynamenode-abraham-Dimension-3000.out: No such file or directory\nlocalhost: head: cannot open `/usr/local/hadoop/bin/../logs/hadoop-hadoop-secondarynamenode-abraham-Dimension-3000.out' for reading: No such file or directory\nmkdir: cannot create directory `/usr/local/hadoop/bin/../logs': Permission denied\nstarting jobtracker, logging to /usr/local/hadoop/bin/../logs/hadoop-hadoop-jobtracker-abraham-Dimension-3000.out\n/usr/local/hadoop/bin/hadoop-daemon.sh: line 117: /usr/local/hadoop/bin/../logs/hadoop-hadoop-jobtracker-abraham-Dimension-3000.out: No such file or directory\nhead: cannot open `/usr/local/hadoop/bin/../logs/hadoop-hadoop-jobtracker-abraham-Dimension-3000.out' for reading: No such file or directory\nlocalhost: mkdir: cannot create directory `/usr/local/hadoop/bin/../logs': Permission denied\nlocalhost: starting tasktracker, logging to /usr/local/hadoop/bin/../logs/hadoop-hadoop-tasktracker-abraham-Dimension-3000.out\nlocalhost: /usr/local/hadoop/bin/hadoop-daemon.sh: line 117: /usr/local/hadoop/bin/../logs/hadoop-hadoop-tasktracker-abraham-Dimension-3000.out: No such file or directory\nlocalhost: head: cannot open `/usr/local/hadoop/bin/../logs/hadoop-hadoop-tasktracker-abraham-Dimension-3000.out' for reading: No such file or directory\nhadoop@abraham-Dimension-3000:/usr/local/hadoop$ \n\nI have no clue what I'm doing wrong or what some of these errors suggest.\nhadoop@abraham-Dimension-3000:/usr/local/hadoop$ jps\n5099 Jps\n\nCan anyone with diagnosing the problem.\n\nA: The errors suggest a permissions problem.\nMake sure that the hadoop user has the proper privileges to /usr/local/hadoop.

Thanks\n\nA: Had the same problem upgrading from ubuntu 10.10 to 11.04. I used the Synaptic drivers in 10.10, but the solution that worked the best for me was to REMOVE all mention of the Synaptics Touchpad diver and Device settings for the touchpad from the xorg.conf file. \nRebooted and the Touchpad worked perfectly with the default ubuntu touchpad drivers.

This will change the name of the process in the process table.\nFor example, if you sudo ln -s /usr/bin/skype /usr/local/bin/notskype and then invoke skype with skype the name of the process that launches won't match the whitelist and you won't see the tray icon.

Using mount will use the kernel implementation of SMB/CIFS, and mounting with gvfs-mount will use the SMB/CIFS implementation in libsmbclient (which is part of Samba). \nMost likely this difference that you are seeing has to do with the fact that libsmbclient is better tweaked for your environment than the kernel implementation. \n", "Q: Menu bar for Thunderbird I installed 11.04 today and I seem to be missing the menu bar in Thunderbird. I don't have either the integrated menu bar in the top panel or any other menu option. Is this a bug or am I missing something?\n\nA: You should have the Global Menu Bar Integration addon installed. Did you install Thunderbird manually? \nTry installing the thunderbird-globalmenu package from the software center and then restarting Thunderbird.\n\nA: I had this problem on a fresh install of 11.04. It was really frustrating to not be able to unmaximize Thunderbird. Workarounds such as alt-Tab and alt-space allowed switching between applications, but there was no way to put the Thunderbird window side-by-side with that of another application. The problem persisted after an upgrade to 11.10. \nThe good news is that I found I only had to reinstall thunderbird-globalmenu via synaptic to fix it. I haven't waited to make sure it stays fixed, yet.\n\nA: I was having a similar problem in that I would lose the menu after opening and closing Thunderbird a few times whenever Minimize to Tray Revived was activated.\nA workaround was to actually disable Global Menu Bar Integration. Then you use Thunderbird's native menu when Minimize to Tray crashes Unity's.\n\nA: Update - The problem came back after restoring the app from the messaging menu. The problem seems to be with an extension I was using. The minimize to tray extension does not seem to work properly with Unity. I will file a bug report with the dev.

With previous versions of Ubuntu, you could specify mount points for various hard drives and partitions during the installation process.  This was useful, because I have a backup hard drive that I set to mount at /media/backup.  When installing Ubuntu 11.04, I can see the box that I used to type this info into, but it doesn't allow keyboard input and I can only choose the pre-defined mount points (e.g. \"/\" and \"/home\").\n\n\nA: This was not intentional -- it's actually a bug in the installer that was noticed too late to be fixed in time for Ubuntu 11.04.\nThere is a workaround -- you can type the mount point you want (\"/media/backup\") in a text document, then copy and paste the text into the box in the installer.\nUpdate -- This has now been fixed.

If your graphics card isn't capable of 3D Compositing, then Ubuntu will fall back to the traditional Gnome desktop that you were used to in Ubuntu 10.10.\nIn some cases your graphics card will be new and powerful enough to run Unity, but you'll still fall back to the classic desktop.  The problem then is that Ubuntu ships with open source graphics drivers for legal reasons, and these drivers may not be advanced enough to run Unity.  In this case, you should be able to install the official, proprietary graphics drivers supplied by your graphics card manufacturer (Nvidia, in your case).  To see if proprietary drivers are available for your system, go to System > Administration > Additional Drivers in the classic interface, and Ubuntu should automatically detect and offer to install any drivers it finds.\nIf there are no drivers available for you that will let you run Unity, you can install Unity 2D from the Software Center.  It provides similar features and a similar interface to the standard Unity interface, and next October, it will be the fallback for users who can't run regular Unity instead of Gnome.\n", "Q: How does Unity's dash index and search work?

I'd like to see an example query.\n\nA: Unity makes use of Zeitgeist in its dash where it provides the user with easy access to its most and recently used data (files/folders/applications) as well as searching over the Zeitgeist FTS (Full Text Search) extension.\nThere is more development going on to bring the same features to a contacts dash where the user can browse his contacts by most/recently used.\n\nFrom the Zeitgeist website:\n\nThis page also explains the activity journal (you need to install this yourself) where you can find the answer to how results ranked/ordered and more.  \n\nSo it uses metadata.\nThe 2nd part of your question is answered from another page from that site: \nWhich technologies does Zeitgeist use?\n\n\n*\n\n*Python\n\n*DBus\n\n*SQLite.\n\n", "Q: Missing Build Dependencies when upload to Launchpad bit of a different question. \nI'm trying to upload a package to a repository that I just started on Launchpad. Launchpad accepts the upload happily, and everything seems good up until the build. It cuts itself short part-way through, reporting \"Missing build dependencies: libswfdec-0.8-dev\". \nNow, this package is listed in the Control file.

Developing Gnome applications, what should I use/implement?\n\nA: Application indicators require another library, so you would have to follow the guides for them on the ubuntu wiki. However, they also support a fall-back mode, so they will still work on standard GNOME.\nHowever, NotifyOSD is just another implementation of a standard notification spec, so nothing changes here.\nOn GNOME the notification system has a different implementation, but it's the same underlying library - so it's code once, run anywhere.\nIn response to your comment:\n\n\n*\n\n*No, standard GNOME applications will not adapt to using application indicators, for no other reason than that (if we are honest here) the GNOME developers don't really like Canonical/Ubuntu, and reject just about anything (most of the time) they (Canonical/the Ubuntu community) produce. For this reason, Canonical has to patch GNOME applications, or third party developers have to create replacements, that honestly should just be pushed upstream, but are blocked by the pointless dam that upstream has in place.\n\n", "Q: How do I install Apache Tomcat 7?

(See the answer by @htorque for that.)\nFor configuring the other options, create a file /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/52-trackpoint-tweaks.conf (or similarly named). The file should have this content:\nSection \"InputClass\"\n    Identifier         \"Trackpoint tweaks\"\n    MatchProduct       \"TPPS/2 IBM TrackPoint\"\n    MatchDevicePath    \"/dev/input/event*\"\n\n    # The default driver now, so optional to put in this line. \n    # But does not hurt mentioning where the options will go.\n    Driver             \"libinput\"\n\n    Option             \"NaturalScrolling\"      \"true\"\nEndSection\n\nTo see the effect, you have to restart X of course. For the list of the other available X.org options, see man(4) libinput.\nFor a list of the corresponding (but differently named) xinput properties, see xinput --list-prop \"TPPS/2 IBM TrackPoint\" or again man(4) libinput. You can use these to test out effects immediately with xinput --set-prop […] commands, without having to restart X every time. And then use the equivalents in the 52-trackpoint-tweaks.conf file to make the changes permanent, as shown above.\n\nA: For my Thinkpad T530, and Ubuntu 15.10.

For example,\n$ xinput --set-prop 12 'libinput Accel Speed' -0.25\n\nOnce you're satisfied, add the command as a startup application (typically under Start menu > Preferences > Startup applications).\nThe above setting name is confirmed for Thinkpad models X1c5 (Ubuntu 18.04), E480 (18.04), and E490 (Mint 19.1).\nNote: the numbering (id=12) may get shuffled if you have an external keyboard or mouse plugged in. For more robustness, try this:\nxinput --set-prop $(xinput | perl -ne 'if(/TrackPoint.*id=(\\d+)/) { print $1; }') 'libinput Accel Speed' -0.25\n\n\nA: On Ubuntu 20.04 LTS and Thinkpad Yoga 4th Gen, the following permanently changes the trackpoint settings (taken from post).\nStep 0. Figure out the name of the device (as htorque suggested):\nfind /sys/devices/platform/i8042 -name name | xargs grep -Fl TrackPoint | sed 's/\\/input\\/input[0-9]*\\/name$//'\nFor me it returns /sys/devices/platform/i8042/serio1 (without serio2).\nNow I quote a slightly modified original post:\n\nStep 1.

Run sudo service sysfsutils restart to apply the changes.\n\nNote that those settings persist over restart.\n\nA: If you are using Ubuntu 15.04 or later (Which will have SystemD installed instead of Upstart), then there is a method posted here which you can use:\nhttps://askubuntu.com/a/611076/253579\n\nA: I have a thinkpad and got everything setup as desired through an application called Pointing Devices, which is just a bit more advanced mouse settings dialog.\nI don't recall how many options there were for sensitivity, but unlike the built-in mouse settings screen, this one regognized the trackpoint and trackpad independently and allowed for greater control like setting the scroll button (was button 2 in my configuration) and enabling palm detection sensitivity.\n\nA: Configure evdev options via xorg.conf.d (DEPRECATED)\nThe evdev driver was the default driver for the trackpoint in earlier versions of Ubuntu, but as of Ubuntu 17.10, the approach below is deprecated and does not work out of the box anymore. This is because the evdev driver which is not installed by default anymore as the libinput driver is the standard now – see my other answer for configuring that.\nIf you want, you can still use the evdev solution below after installing the driver with sudo apt install xserver-xorg-input-evdev (source).\nEverything can be configured nicely in an /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/52-trackpoint-tweaks.conf file (or similarly named – on Ubuntu, you have to create directory and file, but the mechanism works; maybe one of the directory names is x11 instead of X11 in some versions).\nThe file should have this content:\nSection \"InputClass\"\n    Identifier \"Trackpoint tweaks\"\n    MatchProduct       \"TPPS/2 IBM TrackPoint\"\n    MatchDevicePath    \"/dev/input/event*\"\n\n    # Specify the driver, as else Ubuntu 17.10 will use libinput.\n    Driver             \"evdev\"\n\n    # Configure wheel emulation, using middle button and \"natural scrolling\".\n    Option             \"EmulateWheel\"            \"on\"\n    Option             \"EmulateWheelButton\"      \"2\"\n    Option             \"EmulateWheelTimeout\"     \"200\"\n    Option             \"EmulateWheelInertia\"     \"7\"\n    Option             \"XAxisMapping\"            \"7 6\"\n    Option             \"YAxisMapping\"            \"5 4\"\n\n    # Set up an acceleration config (\"mostly linear\" profile, factor 5.5).\n    Option             \"AccelerationProfile\"     \"3\"\n    Option             \"AccelerationNumerator\"   \"55\"\n    Option             \"AccelerationDenominator\" \"10\"\n    Option             \"ConstantDeceleration\"    \"3\"\nEndSection\n\nTo see the effect, you have to restart X of course. To play with these settings while X is running, use xinput, but note that option names are different there.\nAs pointed out by @Vitaly Dubyna, \"Constant Deceleration\" can be used to control sensitivity – it scales down all movements with that factor, so value \"3\" makes all movements 3 times slower compared to default \"1\".\nOption documentation:\n\n\n*\n\n*evdev driver manual (for EmulateWheel options)\n\n*X.org pointer acceleration manual\n\n*more on mouse acceleration\n\nA: On Lubuntu 19.10 for a X201 Thinkpad my red trackpoint was too sensitive.\nI opened the Preferences -> LXQt settings -> Keyboard and Mouse\nI scrolled down the left pane to Mouse and Touchpad\nI selected the device TTPS/2 IBM TrackPoint\nI changed the Acceleration speed to -1,00 (minus one)\n", "Q: Quicklist for Google Chrome (for bookmarks, new windows, etc) not working properly I tried to make a quicklist for Google Chrome by editing the .desktop file in /opt/google/chrome but there is a small problem\nIf i already have an instance of google chrome running and then i use the quicklist's shorcuts, the new google chrome opens in the same icon as the first one, adding the triangle to the left (just as it is supposed to)\nIf, though, i don't have an instance of chrome already running and i use one of the shorcuts i get the new window in its own icon on the launcher - making the launcher have two google chrome icons : one with the quicklist enabled and one without it.\nthe code i used for the quicklist is : \nX-Ayatana-Desktop-Shortcuts=NewWindow;Incognito;GoogleReader;  \"Some more shorcuts here...\"\nName[en_US]=Google Chrome\n[NewWindow Shortcut Group]\nName=New Window\nExec=/opt/google/chrome/google-chrome\nTargetEnvironment=Unity\n[Incognito Shortcut Group]\nName=New incognito window\nExec=/opt/google/chrome/google-chrome --incognito\nTargetEnvironment=Unity\n[GoogleReader Shortcut Group]\nName=Google Reader\nExec=/opt/google/chrome/google-chrome  %U http://www.google.com/reader/view/?hl=en#overview-page\nTargetEnvironment=Unity\n\nand some more exactly like the google reader's shortcut group for the other shorcuts \nCan someone help me with getting a working quicklist on chrome? \nI'm pretty sure others would like to use it too.\n\nA: Chrome seems to have a bug that causes this kind of behavior - one that is fixed in Chromium (at least on the daily version - 13.0.750.0 (83280) - that i tested) . \nThe fix will , eventually, come to Chrome as well.\n(when an update bring the fixed Chrome, i will post here a comment here - unless i have moved away to Chromium permanently) \n\nA: You can take a look at the List of custom Launchers & Quicklists for Unity: Google Chrome Quicklist and there are some other quicklists you might like in there.

This is for consistency of behavior: most menus have never needed tooltips, so it is most consistent if all menus are designed to not need them, rather than some menus having them and some not.\n\nThis is a relatively contentious issue, with 208 people having marked a bug requesting the reintroduction of these tooltips as affecting them.\n", "Q: Only mouse is responsive after closing laptop lid I just upgraded to 11.04 and have been having this issue. I'm using the Unity interface, my card is an Intel GM965.\nWhen I close my laptop lid I have it set to just blank screen. When I open the lid again, the mouse moves but nothing is responsive. I can switch to a terminal but when I switch back, the terminal text remains there with just the mouse moving again.

I am still affected with the problem, but hopefully, since those worked for other users, they might work for you\nps: I know the question is old, but it appears in the first results of google when looking for the problem so I figured it should be answered\n", "Q: Where do I place a file for bookmarks for all users With previous versions of Firefox I put my bookmarks.html file in /etc/firefox/profile and all new user accounts got automatically these bookmarks.\nThis folder doesn't exist on ubuntu 11.04; I tried to create it and put the bookmarks.html file in it but it doesn't seem to work...\n\nA: As far as I understand, the default bookmarks are hidden in /usr/lib/firefox-n.n/omni.jar, you can modify this file to change default bookmarks for all users. Anyway this is not a good practise and I hope providing defaults will get easier in time.\nA nicer way is to provide something in a default profile directory in order to let migration assistant do importing the bookmarks, when new Firefox profile is created. I think you have to provide profiles.ini in /etc/skel/.mozilla/firefox.\n[General]\nStartWithLastProfile=1\n\n[Profile0]\nName=default\nIsRelative=1\nPath=5ge4y5n2.default\nDefault=1\n\nAnd under /etc/skel/.mozilla/firefox/5ge4y5n2.default you can provide your files to be imported to a new profile, for example bookmarks.html or places.sqlite.\nOnly problem with this practise is that it allows only one Firefox profile per user and deleting the profile and creating new one loses the defaults.\n\nA: Create /usr/lib/firefox/defaults/profile directory and put a customized bookmarks.html file inside. \nIt works on Ubuntu 12.04.\n\nA: What you can do is use one profile as a regular one, and the other profile folders as symbolic links to the actual profile.\n", "Q: Is there a command that returns network utilization?

I looked around for a solution, and I found instructions on using xrandr to set a new resolution:\nxrandr --newmode \"1368x768_60.00\"   85.25  1368 1440 1576 1784  768 771 781 798 -hsync +vsync\nxrandr --addmode VGA1 1368x768_60.00\nxrandr --output VGA1 --mode 1368x768\n\nThis worked (but it broke the top Unity panel). Now I need to find a way to automatically start the xrandr commands on boot. I edited /etc/gdm/Init/Default and ~/.xprofile, but neither worked.\nWhat do I do? Can I stop the problem from happening in the first place?\n\nA: This generally happens when the monitor doesn't report it's resolution correctly.\nAs you've found out, at runtime you can use the xrandr tool to add a correct mode and then switch to it.  To make this permanent, you can edit /etc/X11/xorg.conf and add that mode as the preferred mode.  I find the Debian XSF XRandR howto a good guide for editing XRandR settings in xorg.conf.\n\nA: Have you tried editing the file /etc/X11/xorg.conf ?\nYou can find many tutorials out there that explain how to add your own screen resolution in that file :\n\n\n*\n\n*here is a link to the man page.\n\n*and this is a forum post telling you what to do more thoroughly.\n\n\nA: I also had the same problem and solved it after reading this document.

Now I am a new convert from Windows to Ubuntu and I really like what I am seeing. However being a newbie I can't seem to figure out how to create a \"launcher\" on the desktop. I know that you right click and then select \"create launcher\"; what I don't know is the command that I need to use or indeed where to browse to the application (Evolution Mail for example) or where to learn the commands from.\nIf someone could help this newbie out I would appreciate it!\n\nA: When you 'Browse' for an application, you can select any executable file. Almost all applications have their executable file in the folder /usr/bin, so navigate to there. Evolution, for example, has the executable file called 'evolution' in the /usr/bin folder, so select this.\n\nYou can then edit the name for the launcher, the comment and the icon to use. Normally it is clever enough to choose the icon for you but if not, icons are generally stored in /usr/share/pixmaps.\n\nAnother way to find out the commands to use is to use the 'Main Menu' program which edits the Applications, Places, System menus for Ubuntu Classic (GNOME 2.x).\n\nOnce launched, navigate to the application you want to find the command for and click properties.\n\nYou can then look at the command for that application. You can use this command when creating your own launcher.\n\nThere is another method you can use for pre existing applications. Open up a file manager and navigate to /usr/share/applications then right click on the launcher you want and select Copy to -> Desktop.\n\n\nA: I usually open up the Terminal, enter the first few characters of the application and then press tab for autocomplete suggestions.\nOnce you find the command you can use the whereis command to get its location. Here's a quick example:\nwhereis ls\n\nIf you don't want to use the terminal you can search for the command in Nautilus. Installed applications are usually in one of these folders:\n\n*\n\n*/usr/bin\n\n*/usr/local/bin\n\n*/usr/sbin\n\nSometimes the file for launching a third-party application is stored in /opt/application-name/bin.\n\nA: That's an excellent question.  Putting launchers on the desktop is not something I generally do, and I don't think it's something other developers generally do, and it seems to have been neglected.\nThe first thing I tried was to try to drag a launcher from the Applications lens (found in the launcher dock on the left).  However, that failed with an error message (I've filed this bug about that).\nProbably the best thing to do would be to open the file manager and copy one of the existing launchers onto the desktop.

For some reason, Unity doesn't start, but Gnome does. Also, I tried changing the session environment(e.g., Ubuntu/classic), but they all load Gnome.\nSo, why doesn't Unity work?\n\nA: It could be your computer hardware. Unity is kind of graphics hardware dependent IIRC. There is Unity 2D option w/c is almost the same if you just want to try it out.  It (Unity) will work on a VirtualBox upgraded to 4.0.6 with the latest guest additions.\nAnd once you've downloaded Unity 2D, if you decide to go that course, logout and makes ure you select Unity 2D from the options at the login screen. :)\n\nA: Something similar happened to me.\nI logged in Ubuntu classic mode and when I went back to Unity it didn't loaded i just got the wallpaper, and no panel or launcher.\nI did this to fix it:\nLogged in Ubuntu classic mode (without effects), then opened CCSM, deactivated gnome compatibility and activated unity plugin.\nIn my case was some conflict between these two plugins.\nIf your hardware does not support 3d acceleration try installing unity 2d or using a proprietary driver for your graphics card.\n\nA: I was having this problem even after installing the latest drivers and fiddling with CCSM.

My actual aim of this question was to know if there was a method to know the status of my connection at the local level (connection between the machine and AP), which is why I said no ping to x website please. The LAN private address that was mentioned by Alain is something that comes close. If I can diagnose that, I can rule out AP/network issues, then move onto diagnosing the actual connection to my ISP.\n\nA: The command ip link show shows the status of available interfaces. At least one of the interfaces on needs be listed as UP in order for you to have any connectivity at all.\nThe command ip neigh show shows local link state, like this:\n192.168.0.1 dev eth0 lladdr 00:15:e9:ec:cc:80 REACHABLE\n\nYou need at least one REACHABLE to have network access.\nThe command ip addr show shows all interfaces and their IP addresses. \nOnce you have a local IP address and a neighbor's IP address, you can then use ping or another tool to verify local IP connectivity.\n\nA: I think the short answer you are looking for is the command dig, but let me tell you all the commands I use, FWIW.  My experience is in debugging a simple home network setup, with my computer, a wireless router, and a cable modem.\nFirst I start with dig website, which does a DNS lookup.  \nLAN and DHCP\nIf dig times out, then I likely don't have a proper connection to the LAN.  For wired connections, I just check for the blinking lights on the modem.  I don't know of a command that checks for that.  For wireless connections, I use iwconfig and check the ESSID value, making sure that it is set to my network.\nOnce you have the hardware part checked out, the other thing to check for LAN connectivity is DHCP.  I check ifconfig (which is similar to the windows ipconfig) to see if I have an ip address or not.  eth0 is your wired connection, and wlan0 is your wireless connection.  Look at the second line for the value labeled \"inet addr\".  That is the ip address.  Having an ip address of the form 192.168.x.x or 10.0.x.x means I am connected to my LAN, and I am getting an ip address from the router.  \nDNS and Internet\nIf dig comes back with a response, but it is empty, then I am probably connected to my wireless router (ie, the LAN), but there is a problem with my internet connection (ie, the modem).  I will log into my router's web interface and try to debug the issue there.  Or, I will plug in my computer directly to the modem, and recheck the commands above (dig and ifconfig.  Note, the ip address should not be as described above)\nConnected but still not working\nLastly, if dig returns at least one ip address (most small websites have a single ip, where as big sites like google have multiple ips), then I figure I am at least connected and DNS is working.  The problem must exist on the internet somewhere.\nI will then use mtr website as a more comprehensive ping.  Mtr is the same as the windows tracert command; it pings the website along with all intermediate nodes and displays it in a real time visual fashion on the terminal, thus showing me where on the internet I am having trouble.  \nHope that is useful!\n\nA: I use a small utility (in the repository) called wmnetmon.

The leds will shortly turn green for hosts/services that do respond and turn off or start blinking in red for those who do not. You can specify whether it will blink or turn off. In the former case a command will be executed if you configure it on the rc file. This is great for playing sound.\nWhenever you point at some specific led, the corresponding description will appear on the top of the app. If you right-click on it the host/service will become muted, and no command will be executed when that particular system fails. Also you can configure it in the rc file to stop monitoring it when it is muted.

Credit for this solution goes to this Linux and Friends site.\n\nA: \nI had a nice GUI for changing startup applications (after logging in) on GNOME 2. How can I start that application on GNOME 3? \n\nThe answer is simple. You still have nice GUI in your system, only in Gnome 3 is set up to be hidden, don't ask me why. Here's how you bring it back:\nOpen a terminal and copy/paste the following code:\ngksu gedit /usr/share/applications/session-properties.desktop\n\nLook for the line that says NoDisplay=true and change it to NoDisplay=false (or delete the line altogether if you prefer).\n\nA: There's no handy tool to do it in GNOME 3, so you can create a .desktop file manually or use this app.\n\nA: As rossouwap's answer is not working any more on Gnome 3.14+ now you should type Alt + F2 then run gnome-tweak-tool on the dialog and then look for the tab Startup Applications.\nEDIT\nI assume you have Gnome Tweak Tool installed.

The problem with this is, that I am unable to start applications on the separate X screen and when I manage to open a terminal on there, I am unable to interact with it (no window decoration).\nI can still use my setup with the Gnome session (Ubuntu Classic), so I am not urgently looking for an answer, but I would like to know if it can be done and hopefully learn something in the process.\nEdit: I should probably mention that I have two nvidia graphics cards in my computer. And that I am happy with the solution that I am currently using with gnome (i. e. TwinView + separate X screen). This won't work with Unity as I don't know of a way to launch applications on the separate X screen.\n\nA: It's currently quite hard to get even dual monitors working.

You'll likely find similar bugs and you can look in those to see what package to use. And you have the added advantage of knowing that your bug hasn't yet been reported.\nIn your case\nI don't know if I understand you correctly, but if there's some problem with F10, maybe this bug is related?\nOr is your bug that ubuntu is missing a global keybinding manager? As of 11.10, that manager seems to be the Keyboard settings in System Settings.\nOf course, you can also install Compiz Config Settings Manager. And there are some things that it can do and the other cannot.

I use multiple monitors (with Synergy), and I'd like to make the mouse pointer jump over to the next monitor without having to move it. Yes, I am that lazy.

The root partition and  /usr are on sda, the others on sdb or further usb-mounted devices. the only partition unmounted w/o problem seems to be the root partition on sda4. \nI wonder whether the script to umount all devices has a \"wait for success\" loop or that the script itself got corrupted. However, yesterday I upgraded to 11.04 and the error persists.\npmount does not look to be appropriate since the device are not hot-plugged but simply mounted during system start. Obviously mounting /usr and afterwards /usr/local/share as well as /home and later /home/bernhard/fotos/bilder presents problems for umount; the devices may be busy and thus not properly unmounted.\nDoes anybody have an idea for a script to organize unmounting in an ordered way? How to wait for unmounting of the secondary mount? Do you know as well where to place such a script that it will be used instead of the original umount command?\nCould be a general solution.\n\nA: I don't have a 11.04 here to experiment with, but it seems to me that the /etc/init.d/umountfs script should do the unmounting. There you will find that all regular mountpoints are passed to umount in a single invocation. It is left to umount to process those in a sensible order, which it in my opinion should be capable of. There appears to be no “Wait for success” loop in that script. And even if some device wasn't unmounted successfully, umount -r should mount those filesystems read-only, so there should be no need for a log replay.\nIn order to obtain more information on this problem, you might whish to edit that script in one or more of the following ways:\n\n\n*\n\n*Set VERBOSE=yes so you will see more output\n\n*Place a sleep 20 at the beginning and end of do_stop, each preceeded by a suitable echo. That way, you will see what output originates from that script, and have time to actually read it during shutdown. Of course, you should disable your splash screen so you will actually see this output.\n\n*Perhaps also do a set -x so you can see the internal workings of the shell script, the arguments passed to umount in particular.\n\n*Even spawn a shell in there, so you can experiment during shutdown, e.g. to identify reasons why some file system is busy and cannot be unmounted.\n\n*Try to add your own ordering logic, using normal bash syntax to either order the arguments to umount or to perform multiple invocations of umount. I think this should not be necessary if the script works as intended, and if it does not work as intended there should be some kind of error message. So I'd only implement this if there is no other clue as to what goes wrong.\n\n", "Q: Diagnose brightness control Brightness control on my laptop does not work, how can I diagnose if it's unsupported, or a bug?

If you encounter problems trying to load up the LiveCD's, then the Mac support version is likely what you are looking for. \n\nA: I believe the reason for these +mac CDs is that Macs use EFI, whereas most other computers are using a regular BIOS interface (hardware interface, not GUI). For MAC then, a different CD is needed in order to allow the system to boot.\nThis is also why there is bootcamp - apart from driver support; windows (at least in older versions I AFAIK) does not use EFI.\n\nA: Appears to be very little between them, mostly the beginnings of EFI booting:\n$ diff --context=0 ubuntu-11.04-desktop-amd64*list\n*** ubuntu-11.04-desktop-amd64+mac.list 2011-04-27 18:06:42.000000000 +0100\n--- ubuntu-11.04-desktop-amd64.list 2011-04-27 18:05:44.000000000 +0100\n***************\n*** 4 ****\n--- 5 ----\n+ /usb-creator.exe\n***************\n*** 134,135 ****\n- /isolinux/grub/font.pf2\n- /isolinux/grub/grub.cfg\n--- 134 ----\n***************\n*** 144 ****\n--- 144 ----\n+ /efi/boot/bootx64.efi\n\nI've not personally had much luck with the uefi booting, so I'd probably recommend users stick to the regular amd64 releases until uefi is required.  (on most models, the regular disks work fine via bootcamp's bios emulation layer)\n\nA: In Ubuntu 10.10, we changed the normal amd64 CD images to dual-boot on either BIOS or UEFI systems (UEFI, \"Unified Extensible Firmware Interface\", is a different kind of firmware found on many newer systems).  This was done using a technique known as a \"multi-catalog\" CD - it contains two boot images, and the specification says that the firmware is supposed to pick the one it can best use.\nUnfortunately, even though Macs use a variant of EFI (an earlier version of what's now called UEFI), they apparently can't cope with multi-catalog CDs, and simply refuse to boot them.  This left us in rather a quandary: we needed to support UEFI systems, but we didn't want to drop support for Macs either.  I therefore created the amd64+mac CD images, which are exactly the same as the amd64 images except that they only support BIOS booting.  Macs are happy to boot these in their BIOS emulation mode.\n(In fact, the name amd64+mac is a slight misnomer, because it later turned out that some systems other than Macs suffer from a similar problem - but I felt that a more technically accurate naming such as amd64+nouefi would be more likely to confuse than enlighten.)\nWhile I would love to return to shipping just amd64 images rather than both amd64 and amd64+mac, at the moment there is no prospect of reunifying them unless somebody figures out how to make a multi-catalog CD image that Macs can boot.  If you're an expert on this, please do contact me by e-mail.\n\nA: The question is discussed by Matt Gadient here.\nThis page also contains images of few distributions which work for mac.\nIt also contains a short code that suppose to convert an iso image into its +mac version. Works perfectly.\n", "Q: What happens with Windows applications installed via Wine during upgrades? In this case I specifically want to go from 10.10 to 11.04, but maybe there are some generic descriptions out there as well. What should I expect to encounter with a program which works great under Wine right now after a version upgrade?  I understand that there is no way to say for sure, I'm just hoping to include the likely hood of results in my considerations if there is good evidence.    \nWill it be uninstalled, are the odds with me that it will continue to run ok, or is it more likely to end up a broken install?\n\nA: Nothing happens to the Windows Apps. Wine will be the only program updated in that sense.\n", "Q: How do I remove the Unity launcher? How can we remove the launcher that come with Unity on this new Ubuntu version ?\n\nA: You could do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install and launch the ComizConfig Settings Manger.\n\n*Select the Ubuntu Unity Plugin.\n\n*Set the Hide Launcher option to 'Autohide'.\n\n*Set the Reveal Mode option from 'Left' to 'None'.\n\n\nThat should do the trick. You may need to execute setsid unity for the changes to apply.\n\nA: You can go back to the classic GNOME session as described in this answer.\n\nA: In 12.04, you can go to System Settings > Appearance > Behavior and turn on autohide, then turn the sensitivity all the way down. Now the launcher will only show when you press Super.\n\nA: In the file /usr/share/unity-2d/shell/Shell.qml, and can be edited with the command\ngksudo gedit /usr/share/unity-2d/shell/Shell.qml\n\nThe way to remove the remnant bar that was floating there was to set:\nLauncherLoader {\nid: launcherLoader\nanchors.top: parent.top\nanchors.bottom: parent.bottom\nwidth: 0\n\n^Change the width to either 0 or 1, 1 will show 1 pixel, but will not produce graphic artifacts.\n\nIs there a less hack-y way to do this?\nThe other file can be edited using\ngksudo gedit /usr/share/unity-2d/shell/launcher/Launcher.qml\n\nI am aware of the autohide feature in CCSM, however that is not what I am looking for. I wanted to place a separate launcher OVER unity, and the sensitivity of autohide would make it difficult to use both.\n\nA: in compiz i went to the unity section and then the experimental tab and set these values to simply 'fool' the bar into never appearing unless the super button is pressed. If I can get the dash to separate from the bar entirely and move it to Cairo dock i will be extremely satisfied. ...........anyway\nExperimental Tab\n\n\n*\n\n*panel opacity 0.0050\n\n*Launcher Opacity 0.0000\n\n*Reveal Edge 0.2000\n\n*Reveal Pressure 999       (this is the main one so mouse cant grab window)\n\n*Edge Overcome pressure 1\n\n*mouse pressure decay   1\n\n*edge stop              1\n\n*menu fade in and the rest are all   0\n\n*launcher captures mouse  ....UNCheCkEd \n\n\nthis way their is no hacking just a little easy tweaking and dash is still there and bar is only visible when hitting dash ...... i guess i could go remove all the launchers from it now and then it would hardly be noticeable.....cheers\nyou can also go in the config editor and change these values with greater range\n\nA: If you log out, insert your username you can then choose (at the bottom) to log into 'Ubuntu Classic'. That'll get you the old 2 panel style gnome.\n\nA: at least, you can set it to \"autohide\", ccsm has an option for that\n\n\n*\n\n*Install CompizConfig Settings Manager \n(CCSM).\n\n*Alt + F2\n\n*type about:config and press Enter\n\n*change the hide launcher setting to autohide.\n\n\nA: \nImportant:\n\nIf would you want gnome panels before disabling launcher;\n\nNavigate to System>Preferences>Startup Applications\nClick Add\nName=Gnome panels\n\nCommand=gnome-panel\n\nAnd click close button.\nIt's ok.\n\n-Unity with gnome panels\n\nPress SUPER key and type\nccsm\n\nthan press ENTER.\nDisable unity plugin from Compiz Config window (uncheck click box)\nLogout & Login to Ubuntu session\n-Unity without launcher ...\n\n\nA: If you're using Unity 2d you just rename the file /usr/bin/unity-2d-launcher to something else, it will do the trick. You will lose search functionality too, but the menubar will work.\n\nA: *\n\n*Install ccsm (Compiz Config Settings Manager)\n\n*Launch ccsm and click on the \"Unity Plugin\"\n\n*Under \"Behavior\", change \"Hide Launcher\" to \"autohide\"\n\n*Change \"Reveal Mode\" to None.\n\n*Disable \"Key to show launcher\" and \"Key to put focus on launcher\"\n*Disabling \"Key to show launcher\" may prevent you from accessing the dash. If you omit this part of step 5, you can access the dash, but the launcher will appear non-invasively while the dash is displayed. I don't know of any way to stop this.\nUpdate: 12.04 does things differently, thus this may not work after 11.10.\n\nA: In simple words: you can't. By design, the launcher is intended to stay there always. If you want to give it up, the only way to do so is to give up the entire unity interface by switching to some other DE or by switching to the classic GNOME session.\nMoving the launcher to some other edge of the screen is also not implemented and wouldn't be, as per Mark's comment on a bug.\n\nA: Sure when you login, choose your name and when the password box comes up look at the bottom panel and select Ubuntu Classic.\n\nA: You can disable the unity plugin in cssm and log out and in again, and it's gone. But before that perhaps add something like awn to your startup applications.\n\nA: Use unity-2d-panel. It's installed by default. To see what that would feel like, press alt+f2 and run metacity --replace && unity-2d-panel. \n\nA: You could change/disable the reveal mode of the launcher. This will not disable the launcher but then the only way of revealing the launcher will be to press the Super key.\nTo do this, complete steps 1-3 as mentioned by tobi. Now the settings for the reveal mode is displayed, and all you have to do is change the reveal mode.\n\nA: Did you try to hide the Unity Launcher at all? Install Compiz Config Manager (ccsm), run it, and go to Unity Plugin, then open the Advanced Tab (if I remember that correctly -- the last one), and there should be an option to hide the launcher completely. I presume that the Windows-button functionality should still work with dash completely hidden. However, I cannot guarantee this completely removes the launcher, it might, probably, show up when you do something...\n\nA: Use Unity Tweak tool and set the launcher to autohide and then take the reveal sensitivity to the lowest setting, and the unity launcher will only appear when you press super. \nBy design the Unity Launcher cannot be removed, if you want it gone completely then you can try other desktop environments such as GNOME, Xfce or KDE.\n\nA: I know this is more than a year layer, but I still wanted to give my answer: Install Compiz-Config-Settings-Manager, open it up, DISABLE Unity Plugin completely, install GnoMenu or Cardapio, or any of the other search utilities available as plugins for cairo-dock, and there you go!\nAlso, instead of trying to fix Gnome, another alternative is KDE. Install kubuntu-desktop from the software center and you won't regret it.\n\nA: For Unity 7.4.0 replace the file \"/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/compiz/libunityshell.so\" with this file \nlibunityshell.so\nAfter replacing file ,set the launcher in autohide mode and restart pc.\nThis will completely hide unity-launcher even while launching dash. \nHope it works.\n", "Q: How do I force Unity to not use compositing?

And I had to re-compile, very painfully, whenever there was a kernel update.\nAnd both versions of ubuntu did not have the ath9k driver by default. But with 11.04 it looks like nothing can be made to work. Natty installed the driver by deafult, and it froze my system when I turned on the wireless. I compiled and installed from the recent versions, still the system froze. I installed the .deb I created with 10.10 (which had worked there), again the system froze. \nI again compiled from the older sources from which the 10.10 working .deb was created, again the system froze. I usually put my netbook on master mode (as an access point) to share the internet connection my family members. From now on, untill a solution is found, we all have to fight for the single ethernet cable to the modem.\nEdit1: I directly logged in to CLI, without logging in to GUI. In the CLI, when the system froze, \"Kernerl Panic\" was shown, and near it there were ath9k errors too. However, the error did not get logged at /var/log.\nEDIT2: Same issue with Ubuntu 11.10 too. The moment eth0 and wlan0 are bridged (with hostapd) the system freezes. And the freezing happens only if I enable wireless master mode. Even after googling for hours, I was not able to solve the issue.\n\nA: Solved the issue. I compiled it from these patched sources. As ath9k drivers come by default on 2.6.38 kernel, the directory /lib/modules/2.6.38-8-generic/kernel/net/wireless/ath should be removed.

If you also want information about sources, also mirror http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/*/*/source\nThen set up a configuration file, for example:\n\nmirror /srv/mirror/old-releases/\n\nIf you add nothing else to the configuration, it will tell you about every architecture for every release.\nTo keep this up-to-date, you probably want to have a cron job that updates it somewhere in the beginning of December and June (because sometimes the migration of a release takes a little while).\n", "Q: Ignoring a complete thread in a mailing list I am subscribed to a couple mailing lists, but there are some topics I am not interested in. Thunderbird groups topics nicely in threads, but always highlights threads with new answers.\nWhen I delete a thread, new messages continue to come in but are just unbundled without the initial question, that is even worse.\nIs there some way to ignore a thread and all follow-up?\n\nA: I don't know of a way to do it through Thunderbird, but if you're using a gmail or google apps email account, you can \"mute\" conversations through the web interface. There is also a Lab that you can enable called \"Smart Mute,\" helps even more.\n\nA: There is a Thunderbird add-on called \"MuteThread\" that is intended to do exactly this.

On linux, that will probably just be 'gvim -f'.\nMost importantly, you will then need to add the 'External Editor' button to your toolbar.  Without adding the toolbar button the plugin would not work for me.  Below I included a picture where you can see the 'External Editor' button that I'm referring to.\nAfter adding the toolbar button, you can launch the external editor with the toolbar button or CTRL-E\n\n\nA: Try Teledactyl. You can do much more vim-oriented things with it but if you're only interested in editing files in vim, it also works, just disable all of it and keep the external editor feature on.\nThis is what I had (use GMail interface now) in my .teledactylrc file:\n:set editor='gvim -S .vimrcforvimperator -f'\n\n\nA: At this web site you can find a non official thunderbird extension to use an external editor of your choice:\n\nhttp://globs.org/download.php?lng=en\n\n\nA: I think you should use this tutorial to solve your problem.\nLink Here: http://blog.geekq.net/2010/05/13/vim-external-editor-thunderbird-3-ubuntu/\n", "Q: Enabling Compiz Disables Windows Title Bar - Why?

I read a couple of other questions on this topic and they both pointed to the Grub2 community documentation and installing grub configs from an install disk.  I had some trouble with the documentation, so here's where I am.  This may be complete PEBKAC.\nI have two guests sitting on an Ubuntu 10.04 server virtualized under KVM, both were initially running 10.04.  I used \"do-release-upgrade\" to update to 10.10 without a hitch on both boxes, rebooted, and then ran \"do-release-upgrade\" to update to 11.04 on both boxes.  In my haste, I ignored the errors about missing grub configurations.  When I restarted the guests, naturally I'm presented with a grub prompt.  Issuing \"boot\" yields \"error: no loaded kernel\".\nHere's ls output for the root partition:  \n\nWhen following the manual boot guide, I can't get the options straight either using \"SS928-root\" or \"hda0,1\" as the root filesystem.  Most everything gives the \"file not found\" error.\nIssuing \"ls\" on both of those filesystems show several options for vmlinuz and initrd.img.  These guests are using LVM if that helps any.\nEDIT\nI've gotten a little bit further.  The following command sequence:\n\nYields the following screen (after scrolling through quite a bit of text):\n\n\nA: After looking at jdehaan's post, I checked out a machine with a similiar configuration.

The rest of your posts was kept alike during my tries.\n\nA: If you have a working grub config somewhere, ls at the root level lists partitions, and configfile (boot device)/path/to/grub.config lets you boot your grub config.\n", "Q: initramfs problem when out of disk space I just upgraded from 10.10 to 11.04. During the upgrade process, it said there was a problem setting up initramfs-tools and I needed to do sudo dpkg --configure -a\nSo once I got 11.04 started for the first time, I did that. This is the output. \nSetting up initramfs-tools (0.98.8ubuntu3) ...\nupdate-initramfs: deferring update (trigger activated)\nProcessing triggers for initramfs-tools ...\nupdate-initramfs: Generating /boot/initrd.img-2.6.38-8-generic\n\ngzip: stdout: No space left on device\nE: mkinitramfs failure cpio 141 gzip 1\nupdate-initramfs: failed for /boot/initrd.img-2.6.38-8-generic\ndpkg: error processing initramfs-tools (--configure):\n subprocess installed post-installation script returned error exit status 1\nErrors were encountered while processing:\n initramfs-tools\n\nAfter searching around, it seemed like this was a problem of insufficient space in my /boot partition. It is only 100 MB and this has never been a problem before, but despite deleting all but the latest kernel I still get the same message. \n\nA: I'd suggest seeing what is taking up space in /boot/:\nfind /boot/ -type f | xargs du | sort -n\n\nThen, if you find large consumers of space, you can see which package they're from:\ndpkg -S /boot/some-large-file\n\nAnd if that package is no longer needed, you can remove it. However, be very careful to not remove stuff that you need - particularly the bootloader (grub), and the currently-running kernel.\n\nA: 100MB is sufficient for 2 kernels and a init ramdisk. You can view your current installed kernels by executing:\ndpkg -l 'linux-image-*' | grep '^ii'\n\nExample output:\nii  linux-image-2.6.35-28-generic        2.6.35-28.50                               Linux kernel image for version 2.6.35 on x86/x86_64\nii  linux-image-2.6.38-8-generic         2.6.38-8.42                                Linux kernel image for version 2.6.38 on x86/x86_64\nii  linux-image-generic                  2.6.38.8.22                                Generic Linux kernel image\n\nAfter confirming that the latest kernel works, you can remove the previous ones. In this case, there is only one redundant kernel:\nsudo apt-get purge linux-image-2.6.35-28-generic\n\nIf this process does not complete because of previous installation triggers, try adding -f (--fix-broken) before purge.\n", "Q: Nautilus shortcut for new blank files? \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow do you create a “new document” keyboard shortcut? \n\nJust like Ctrl-Shift-N for folders.

I just upgraded to ubuntu 11.04, and I am looking for a good way to tile windows.

Later I again installed Natty with ext4 filesystem. \nWhy do such errors appear?\n\nA: btrfs is considered experimental and unless you're very adventurous, you should avoid using it. There is neither a fsck tool available in case the btrfs filesystem becomes corrupt (after a power failure for example).\nAn excerpt from the release notes:\n\nThe btrfs filesystem is considered experimental in this release. It can generally be installed and used, but with a number of problems. You should only use it if you are comfortable with dealing with problems and helping us resolve them.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*As the btrfs wiki notes: \"Note that Btrfs does not yet have a fsck tool that can fix errors. While Btrfs is stable on a stable machine, it is currently possible to corrupt a filesystem irrecoverably if your machine crashes or loses power on disks that don't handle flush requests correctly. This will be fixed when the fsck tool is ready.\"\n\n*GRUB cannot detect a btrfs installation within an encrypted disk, and fails to set up the correct kernel parameters.

Is there any output from grub-install when you do that?  If so, post it here.\n\nA: In this case I'm going to go out on a limb and guess that your problem was a version of grub that did not, or did not correctly, support btrfs.  There are two solutions.  Either give your system a separate, ext2/3 boot partition, or use the latest version of grub that supports btrfs in a much cleaner manner.\n", "Q: using DNS lookup in chroot postfix I'm trying to set up a postfix set up on my client machines.

As you can see in the script, I am making sure that the app is created in the correct directory and other checks related to directory, so I don't think I can call the script from rnew for a directory that is yet to be created?\n\nA: Another option: have your script print the directory name at the end of the script. \n...\necho \"$appdirectory\"\nexit\n\nFor any error conditions, print the error message to stderr (echo something >&2) and exit with a non-zero return code (exit 1).

I also want to display that text in the terminal as well.\nHow do I go about doing this?\n\nA: You can use the tee command for that:\ncommand | tee /path/to/logfile\n\nThe equivelent without writing to the shell would be:\ncommand > /path/to/logfile\n\nIf you want to append (>>) and show the output in the shell, use the -a option:\ncommand | tee -a /path/to/logfile\n\nPlease note that the pipe will catch stdout only, errors to stderr are not processed by the pipe with tee. If you want to log errors (from stderr), use:\ncommand 2>&1 | tee /path/to/logfile\n\nThis means: run command and redirect the stderr stream (2) to stdout (1). That will be passed to the pipe with the tee application.\n\nA: script will start an interactive session and log all the output (stdout/stderr etc) to a file, or (with the -c parameter) will run a command and log the output of that.\nscript -c ~/.abc.sh -f abc.log\n\nNote: in an interactive session, you can stop recording just by exiting the session as you normally would (e.g. exit or Ctrl-D).\nFor session recording with video playback, you can also try asciinema.\n", "Q: Personal file sharing error, can't find webdav package I want to share files from my ubuntu laptop to my mac pro (mac os x), my question is, what do I have to install to be able to use this program?\nI tried to install \"WebDAV\" but I couldn't find it.

It sports a decent Core i3 processor, 4 gigs of RAM and a 500GB HDD. It also came with Wireless-N, a real bonus because I am using a Wireless-N router. The WiFi chipset is a Ralink 5390. It came preinstalled with Windows 7, and everything works fine in there (obviously). \nI then proceeded to install Ubuntu 10.10 x64 a few days ago (this is before Natty came out) and everything worked . . . except WLAN. So I plugged in via Ethernet and went looking and found that I clearly wasn't the first to discover this issue. I found a guide here that I followed to download the Ralink Linux driver (which is stated to support my chipset), configure, compile, and install. Everything went perfectly, I restarted; lo and behold, I have a list of access points. I went to connect to mine, entered the password, and now the animated \"WiFi wave\" logo keeps going indefinitely until you click it, and it freezes for a few minutes. It will unfreeze if you let it sit but clicking it causes the same freeze again.\nI couldn't really care less about a WiFi icon freezing, but a.) it freezes everything else in the system up, not just the icon, and b.) it never actually completes the WiFi connection. Anyone knowledgeable in fixing issues like these that has an idea what to do, I would really appreciate it! I really, really don't want to be forced to use Windows because of a crappy WiFi driver!\nSince Natty came out I installed that and I can't even compile the driver without fatal errors, so I reverted to 10.10 and everything is the same as it was before.

Another benefit is allowing access to many more commands and scripts.\nA common terminal task of installing an application can be achieved within a single command, compared to navigating through the Software Centre or Synaptic Manager. \nFor example the following would install Deluge bittorrent client:\nsudo apt-get install deluge\n\nTo save a detailed list of files in the current directory tree to a file called listing.txt:\nfind -type f > listing.txt\n\nSometimes you will also see the following notation:\n$ whoami\ncalum\n$ ls\nDownloads  Documents\n\nThis means that the command whoami is executed which gives calum as output. Following that command, ls is executed which outputs Downloads  Documents.\nA similar notation is:\n# apt-get update\n\nThis means that the command should be run as root, that is, using sudo:\n$ sudo apt-get update\n\nNote that the # character is also used for comments.\n# this command will give your username\nwhoami\n# the next command will show the contents of the current directory\nls\n\n\nHow do I open a terminal:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the Dash (Super Key) or\nApplications and type terminal\n\n\n*Use the keyboard shortcut by pressing Ctrl+Alt+T.\n\n*For older or Ubuntu versions: (More Info)\nApplications → Accessories → Terminal\n\nAlternative names for the terminal:\n\n\n*\n\n*Console\n\n*Shell\n\n*Command line\n\n*Command prompt\n\n\n(Although technically they mean different things)\n\nCommon commands & Further information\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu Documentation: Using The\nTerminal\n\nA: A Terminal is your interface to the underlying operating system via a shell, usually bash. It is a command line.\nBack in the day, a Terminal was a screen+keyboard that was connected to a server. Today, it is usally just a progam.\nYou can open it via the utilities part of the apllications menu, or press Alt+F2 and type gnome-terminal.\n\nA: The terminal (also known as console) is an application in which you can execute commands directly. It looks like:\n\nYou can start the terminal from Applications -> Accessories -> Terminal.\nIf you're not using Gnome, but KDE (Kubuntu), you would find it under: Kickoff menu -> Applications -> System -> Konsole.\nThe Ubuntu wiki has an article about the terminal which includes information on starting the terminal in Xubuntu and Lubuntu, and a basic overview of commonly used commands. It's recommended for reading as it includes much examples as well.\n\nA: \nA Terminal is a command interpreter. A Terminal is an entity that takes input from the user and deals with the computer rather than the user deal directly with the computer. If the user had to deal directly with the computer he would not get much done as the computer only understands strings of 1's and 0's\n\nExample\nWhen a person drives a car, that person doesn't have to actually adjust every detail that goes along with making the engine run, or the electronic system controlling all of the engine timing and so on. The dashboard would also be considered part of the the Terminal since pertinent (Having logical precise relevance to the matter at hand) information relating to the user's involvement in operating the car is displayed there. In fact any part of the car that the user has control of during operation of the car would be considered part of the Terminal.\nTerminal is a program that allows the user to use the computer without him having to deal directly with it. It is in a sense a protective shell that prevents the user and computer from coming into contact with one another.\nHow Do I Use It ? @ cas\n\nA: Simply said, a Terminal is a CLI (Command Line Interface) to interact with programs in the computer.\nIn Ubuntu you can open a terminal:\n\n*\n\n*by pressing Ctrl+Alt+T\nor\n\n*\n\n*by pressing the Super key, type \"terminal\" and then hit Enter.\n\nYou can use the terminal for various tasks, such as:\n\n*\n\n*Installing, updating, and deleting software.\n\n*For power off, reboot, sleep...\n\n*Creating and removing files and folders.\n\n*Many more...\n", "Q: How to play music files directly from folders? I would love to, while in a given folder, right-click on it and choose play, to play all music files in that folder (and subfolders if any). \nIs there an easy way to achieve this?\n\nA: You can achieve this with a Nautilus script.\nFirst install a ruby package \nsudo apt-get install ruby-1.9.1\n\nThen copy this text into a text editor and save the file in ~/.gnome2/nautilus-scripts. Call it something like 'Play'.\n#!/usr/bin/env ruby1.9.1\nrequire 'find'\n\nPLAYER = \"banshee\"\nPLAYER_OPTIONS = [\"--play-enqueued\"]\n\ndef play *f\n    IO.popen [PLAYER, *PLAYER_OPTIONS, *f] do |io|\n        io.read\n    end\nend\n\ndef is_audio f\n    begin\n        io = IO.popen ['file', '--mime-type', f]\n        op = io.read.split(' ')\n        r = op[op.length-1] =~ /audio/\n        io.close\n        r\n    rescue\n    end\nend\n\nfiles = []\n\nARGV.each do |f|\n    if File.directory? f\n        Find.find f do |f|\n            files << f if is_audio(f)\n        end\n    else\n        files << f if is_audio(f)\n    end\nend\n\nplay(*files)\n\nOpen ~/.gnome2/nautilus-scripts in the file manager, right click on the file, click properties and make it executable.\nYou can now right click on some files and select scripts -> Play to play all of the music files you have selected.\n\nA: Well, this end up working for me:\nhttp://mundogeek.net/nautilus-scripts/#nautilus-play-banshee\n:) Yupi.\n\nA: This is probably silly answer but I just right clicked and selected \"Open With Other Application... \" then I selected my music player which is Audacious. Only drawback is that now every folder has an option to open with Audacious but I'm ok with that.\n", "Q: Upgrading to Ubuntu 11.04 failed Today Ubuntu asked me to upgrade to 11.04.

I'm running an upgrade from Maverick to Natty from a mounted 'alternate' ISO, but it's current status is \"Fetching file 1444 of 1703 at 55.1 kB/s\". I'm pretty sure it's trying to use the network for the \"Getting new packages\" phase. How can I make sure it uses only the ISO, and not the network? Disconnecting the network (or keeping it disconnected the entire time) just results in stalling (waiting, not freezing) during the \"Getting new packages\" phase.\nI've followed the instructions on the Ubuntu Wiki for upgrading using the Alternate CD ISO mounted as a drive. Also, I selected \"No\" to the question about updating packages during the upgrade.\nIf this is a bug, please give a link with the bug number or tell me that I should file a bug.\n\nA: Using the Alternative CD, and not unplugging the Ethernet (before) boot, does NOT behave the same as answering: NO.\nHave you tried, with the network cable umplugged? \n\nA: I also had this problem. My solution was to uncheck all software repositories, then the upgrade from cd worked.\n\nA: Following the upgrade instructions on the Ubuntu Wiki:\nBurn the ISO to a CD and insert it in your computer OR mount the ISO using:\nsudo mount -o loop ubuntu-11.04-alternate-amd64.iso /media/cdrom\n\nWhen done, run the upgrade application from the CD:\ngksu /media/cdrom/cdromupgrade\n\nFollow the instructions, when askes whether you want to download updates from the internet, choose No.\n\nA: The alternate cd does not have everything on it.  I recently did this using the dvd image and it seemed to only download one or two things ( I didn't answer no to the question ).  Maybe you have a bunch of packages installed that are not on the alternate cd so it has no choice but to download them?\n", "Q: Seeing the weather again in the \"current time bar\" on Ubuntu 11.04 \nPossible Duplicate:\nIs there a weather indicator? \n\nOk , so until now I was able to see the current weather in my city directly in the top panel, included in the time bar.

I'm Linux newbie so please, be simple. I also would like to ask is there some working solution for hybrid graphic on Ubuntu? I've read some info on the internet but haven't found any solution and nVidia says they will not provide support for Linux with their hybrid graphics technology.\n\nA: Hybrid graphics is a bad thing under Linux. Unfortunately there's not a good and easy solution to get 3D acceleration, but I can guide you to remove the Nvidia driver.\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot Ubuntu while holding Shift to make sure GRUB fires up\n\n*Choose to enter in recovery mode, and when prompted, you should choose to boot in safe graphics mode\n\n*Now you can log in with a low resolution and remove the driver\n\n\nA: Hybrid graphics has improved a bit lately. Have a look at these websites:\nhttp://launchpad.net/~hybrid-graphics-linux\nhttp://linux-hybrid-graphics.blogspot.com/ \nBumblebee has an ./install.sh command that does all the installation for you. The fact that is in github is for convenience of rapid development and convenient download.

Eventually you will be offered a selection of stuff to install - one of which is xubuntu.\nRemember to be connected to the internet via a wired connection - the minimal CD downloads all its stuff from the internet. \n\nA: I'm not sure where you got your .iso from. Mine is 687.8MB from the Xubuntu home-page and fits on a CD. \nTry downloading the file from the main Xubuntu page here and burning that .iso to CD instead.

I'm a programmer, but rather than trying to fix them (which could become a huge time-sink), I thought I'd try the open-vm-tools package, since that's available for 11.04 and should be essentially a precompiled version of the same thing.\nIt didn't work at first, but I found this page describing the proper way to install them -- you apparently have to install open-vm-dkms first (not sure why, I'd think it would auto-install as a dependency, but it didn't). After that, install open-vm-tools. Then in the VMware Fusion settings, turn OFF Shared Folders, then turn them back on.\nAfter that, my shared folders appeared in /mnt/hgfs as normal. :-)\n\nA: Read this blog for solutions to VMware Tools compilation errors under Ubuntu 11.04 and VMware Fusion 3.1.2\n", "Q: \"fixing recursive fault but reboot is needed\" error I am running a 64bit laptop and i am trying to install ubuntu 11.04 from both a usb and cd.

Or am I affected by some bug / inconsistency?

Is there a way to force them to stop moving around? I like to see certain apps in certain positions and this bothers me.\n\nA: First issue: bug.\n\n\n*\n\n*Please report it.\n\n\nSecond issue (you really should ask two separate questions, but I will answer anyway :)!:\n\n\n*\n\n*Unity uses fixed locations for applications that have actually been added to the launcher manually (favourites). So for example, if you run Nautilus, it will always appear in the same location as your Home folder icon (at the top by default). However, if for example, you install a new application without adding it to the launcher, and run it, unity will simply place this application below your favourites (in what ever space is available). This may make it seem as if applications are moving around (scary ain't it?), but in fact, they are not! They are just falling into place where ever there is room to do so. To get your applications to \"stay in one place\" (and don't move!!!):\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the Dash.\n\n*Start typing the name of the application until it appears.\n\n*Click and drag the application icon to the spot on the launcher where you would like it to be.\n\n*From now on the application will stay in the same place unless you move it to another location :)!\n\n\n\nA: First issue: The Unity bar opens fully only when you reach the far top left corner of the screen. When you do that it stays open and on top for a period of time (at least for me) or permanently, i.e. as long as i hold my cursor over the ubuntu logo.\nSecond issue: Applications that you keep in the launcher should definitely maintain their positions (mine do). Application that you open and are not in the launcher appear just above the workspace switcher.\n", "Q: Emerald doesn't work anymore?

In essence emerald is dead.\n\nA: Here is a working PPA for Emerald.\n\nppa:malteworld/compiz\n\n\nA: You can run emerald in 11.04 but you must compile it from source as the version in the official repositories is incompatible with compiz in natty.

Thunderbird has been reporting that I'm using 81% of my inbox quota, but my ISP says I have no inbox quota. One of them is wrong.

Perhaps they've assigned a certain size and will increase it as needed if you use up what they give. If your inbox starts taking up several gigabytes or so, I'd expect for your ISP to talk to you about your usage.\n", "Q: Missing of gnome-panel applets after upgrade After the upgrade to natty I am missing various applets for the gnome-panel.

The other 95% is that your hard drive might be dying. Now to calm you, the alarm will pop up when it detects a problem with the SMART (ANY of the many problems a hard drive can have with it...even little ones like some cluster/sector/block has something bad).\nMy example is 2 Hard drives that in Ubuntu 10.04 one of them happen to have some horrible problems and the alarm came out EVERY SINGLE TIME Ubuntu booted. In Ubuntu 10.10 the problem went away since Disk Utility had a problem with some 1TB HDDs. It was solved, but since this is a software that checks for SMART data, this does not give 100% guarantee that your hard drive is bad, dying or damaged. You can click on the Hard Drive and then click the SMART Data button. That should mention the type of problem you have and how many bad sectors you have.\nNOTE: If you have around 500 bad sectors, I suggest you start checking for a new hard drive.

There are two prior questions that tangentially touch on this here & here. It's not really what I'm after though.\nI plan on installing Debian Squeeze & Ubuntu Natty in a dual-boot scenario. In both cases I'll be using amd64 builds.\nThere are obvious similarities between these distros and I wonder if I can leverage this to my advantage in some way. I also wonder if these similarities will cause me any foreseeable problems, perhaps with Grub2, .bashrc, etc.\nSpecifically, I wonder if it's advisable to share the /home partition. Packages will in general be more bleeding edge with Natty. Will this cause problems with configuration files that reside in /home?\nWhile I'm at it, I may as well ask:\n\n\n*\n\n*Does it matter which distro I install first?\n\n*Are there any other directories that could be shared - not just for the sake of being tricky, but because it would be advantageous to do so?\n\n\nI assume I can safely share the swap partition. Suppose sharing /home isn't a good idea then I'm left with one-too-many primary partitions: \n\n\n*\n\n*/ [debian; ext4]\n\n*/home [debian; ext4]\n\n*/ [ubuntu; ext4]\n\n*/home [ubuntu; ext4]\n\n*swap [debian/ubuntu]\n\n\nDo I overcome this by using swap files? Or should I use extended partitions?\nCheers.\n\nA: *\n\n*About Sharing your /home partition: Yes you can do that, you can read https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/6344/different-linux-distros-sharing-the-same-home-folder. Some people will say no for sharing same partition but you can hack it by creating two different users in the same partition. By the way you can use any folder as home folder How to do that?? see this Change home folder in Natty\n\n*Theoretically and in my opinion it does not matter which distribution comes first, but it would be good if it the partition of your preferred distro is the first partition.  Because the first partition would be closer to the center of spinning disc that means lesser radius will make fetching information more quick. Any ways it would just give you some milliseconds advantage. \n\n*Swap partitions can be shared without any problem, Only problem you may have is when you hibernate one system and boot second. Though this would not be a big problem and will not break the system still you may loose your work saved while hibernating. \n\n", "Q: Multitouch Gestures - Maverick -> Natty upgrade I'm using a Lenovo T410. I upgraded from Maverick to Natty. utouch didn't get installed, so I installed it with aptitude.\nThe only gesture I have working is two finger scrolling, which was active prior to installing utouch. None of the other gestures do anything.\nWhat am I missing? I'm pretty sure the laptop supports multitouch.\n\nA: As you said in your comment, you use a Synaptics touchpad. I also had a similar experience; I bought a new shiny laptop with a Synaptics multitouch touchpad and was excited on using gestures in Ubuntu. The problem is that the Synaptics touchpad driver in Ubuntu doesn't support any advanced gestures other than two finger scrolling.\nWork is going on to improve MT (multitouch) support for Synaptics touchpads, and we may get better support in 11.10 (not confirmed, but I hope so). Even if full support is implemented, one thing to note is that the Synaptics touchpads don't support finger presses above 3 fingers, and it also doesn't support rotating gestures (though zoom, drag, 3-finger press/drag, etc are supported). That's a hardware limitation, and nothing much can be done about that.\n", "Q: KDE or upgrade? I want to upgrade my home desktop to Narwal and switch from Gnome to KDE.

Just back up your /home folder and put it into the Kubuntu /home folder when you complete the install.\n\nA: In Ubuntu, KDE should upgrade cleanly.  If you really want not to do that, you could pare down your system, upgrade, and then install KDE, with aptitude, as follows (yes, this may be possible with apt, but I don't know how):\n\nfor pkg in $(aptitude search ~i | grep -v \"i A\" | cut -d\\  -f4); do\n    echo \"-- markauto $pkg --\"\n    sudo aptitude markauto $pkg\ndone\n\nThis will prompt you several times to confirm whether sets of stuff ought be removed.

And in Linux I can usually do that.  (And it's free cake!)  I'm a little shocked that it hasn't been easier (or as far as I know, even possible) to change the keyboard shortcuts for Unity.  Someone suggested in another post that the Unity launcher can be changed from Super to Ctrl + Super, then I can map the other keybindings that I want.  But I like a lot of the features that Unity has with only pressing the Super key (I find it a lot easier to press Super+e than Ctrl+Super+e).  However, I want to be able to change what some of the bindings in Unity are, primarily change Super+t from opening trash to opening a terminal (currently Ctrl+Alt+t).  \nWith that background, here is my question: is Unity working on allowing users to customize the keybindings to their preference?\n\nA: Many of keybindings you can change in Compiz Config Settings Manager (ccsm command).\n", "Q: Can't compile matplotlib on Ubuntu 11.04 / ft2build.h: No such file or directory I'm trying to build matplotlib from source but it isn't working.

Please try upgrading to grub 1.99 rc1 or newer and if you can still reproduce the problem please file a bug report.\nThat said though, I'd recommend going with ext{3,4} for production systems as it's just better supported in general.\n", "Q: how to change default launcher icons in unity for a new user? I have customised my Unity launcher's icon list with custom launchers . Now I want the same customised launcher to appear when i create a new user. Currently the default ubuntu launcher appears when I create a new user.\nHow do I do that?\n\nA: Ok, after googling around I found the answer. It's quite simple. The answer is a combination of the two answers above plus a few more. Open a Terminal and type the following command:\nsudo cp -rf .config/ .gconf/ .gconfd/ .gnome2/ /etc/skel/\n\nThat's it. Now all the changes will appear for the new user. This worked for me. I tested the changes by creating a new user.\nNote that this will not change the launchers for already existing users, just for newly created users.\n\nA: First, get your 'favorites' list:\n$ gsettings get com.canonical.Unity.Launcher favorites\n\nThe output should be like this:\n['ubiquity-gtkui.desktop', 'nautilus-home.desktop', 'firefox.desktop', 'libreoffice-writer.desktop', 'libreoffice-calc.desktop', 'libreoffice-impress.desktop', 'ubuntu-software-center.desktop', 'ubuntuone-installer.desktop', 'gnome-control-center.desktop']\n\nNow open /usr/share/glib-2.0/schemas/com.canonical.Unity.gschema.xml file for edit, find schema with id=\"com.canonical.Unity.Launcher\" and replace the <default> value of <key type=\"as\" name=\"favorites\"> with your custom settings from the first step.\n\nA: This is a speculative guess...\nI believe the adduser command is launched when creating a new user.  It creates a new user home folder using the contents in /etc/skel\nif you run a ls -al /etc/skel you'll notice that there is a very basic folder structure.\nTry creating a .local/share/applications folder in /etc/skel.  Then copy the contents of your .local/share/applications folder to /etc/skel/.local/share/applications\n\nA: The favourites list is managed by a dconf entry.\nI'm no bash expert, but I believe if you add a command in the adduser file in /etc/skel to add the favourites list you have, then it should work for every new user.\nSorry I can't really get it more technical yet (I will try to improve my answer).\n", "Q: Can I install Unity 2D and 3D at the same time? Just for kicks, is it possible to install both Unity 2D and Unity 3D at the same time without breaking either one of them? What's the difference, anyway? 2D (QT) vs 3D (GTK2)?\n\nA: Yes it should be easy to install both without breakage (unlike GNOME Shell).\nWhilst the 2D version is itself programmed in QT, then the underlying applications for both Unity 2D and 3D, can be QT or GTK. It makes no difference.\n\nA: Yes, it's possible.\nUnity 2D as far as I know is written using Qt, \nthe 3D version is a compiz plugin.\n", "Q: Wallpaper is broken and mouse pointer is inconsistant I've got Natty running on a desktop for my parents to use.

On the desktop, launcher, panel etc, it's the default white one, but in Firefox and LibreOffice, it’s the large red theme. \n\n\nAny help appreciated.\n\nA: Make sure u have logged out and then log back in, that should fix the pointer theme not changing, if it still persists install lxappearance, sudo apt-get install lxappearance and change the mouse cursor theme from there.\n\nA: The problem with your mouse cursor is a known bug in compiz, and you can mark it as affecting you, as well as request that it be taken with priority (I'm sure they will listen if you mention that it is an accessibility issue).\nThe wallpaper problem, I'm not too sure about what could be causing that. Does nautilus work in general?\n\nA: In case you tried to play with transparency and used gnome-color-chooser and murrine when you were on ubuntu 10.10, try again to deactivate/reactivate murrine in gnome-color-chooser -> rendering engine (I put murrine for both global and dashboard).\n\nA: The mouse pointer problem has been addressed on another AskUbuntu question right here.\n", "Q: Unity 3.8.12 Release Date I like to keep a tab on the development progress of Unity on Launchpad. Currently I am running Unity 3.8.10 on Natty. On launchpad it shows that Unity 3.8.12 \"0day-SRU\" was released like 3 days ago. However I have not got this update yet. I am eagerly waiting for it as it fixes many bugs that I face while using Unity.\nWhy am I not getting the update? Also what does \"oday-SRU\" mean?\n\nA: Its a 0-day SRU (Stable Release Update). In simpler language:\n1) An SRU is an updated version of a package which is uploaded for a release which has been released already. SRUs are more commonly known as 'software updates' and these are the things which come up in Update Manager.\n2) 0-day SRU means that it is an update which will land very soon after the release of Ubuntu 11.04 (usually the same day as the release itself).\nAccording to the SRU procedure, every SRU package should be first uploaded to the proposed repository. Then, the bugs fixed by it should be confirmed by a user as being fixed before the package could be moved to the main updates repository.\nIn this case, the Unity 3.8.12 package fixed 5 bugs, 3 of which have been verified (as of the time of posting this answer) and 2 are still in need of verification. The Unity 3.8.12 package is lying in the proposed repository, and will stay there until someone verifies the 2 remaining bugs. Once that is verified, then you'll get Unity 3.8.12 as an update from Update Manager. This should happen in a maximum of 4-5 days from now.\nYou can check the status of the Unity package in the proposed repository at this link. Browse down until you reach natty and then look at the Unity package row. Under changelog bugs, a blue bug link is a bug which is awaiting verification, a green bug link is a bug which has been verified successfully by a user, and a red bug link is a bug which wasn't verified successfully (in other words, the bug fix didn't work).\nIf you are impatient and want the package right now, then you can enable the proposed repository in your system by following this guide (WARNING: not recommended as the updates could be untested and might lead to regressions) and then you will get the Unity upgrade automatically. Once you've upgraded, then you can yourself verify a bugfix and go to the relevant bug page and comment that you've successfully verified the SRU. Also, tag the bug with verification-done and remove the verification-needed tag if you have verified the SRU successfully. If the bugfix doesn't work, then tag it with verification-failed.\n", "Q: Where is the \"Open with...\" option in Ubuntu 11.04?

Are the login sounds included with Natty? If there are no sounds, can I remove it from the startup applications?\n\nA: By clicking Edit button of Gnome Login Sound in Startup Applications Preferences, you should check if the path is correct and is a valid path.  If the path contains a regular wav file, it should work properly.\nEdit: Of course, you can delete this option if you don't wanna.\n\nA: I had the same problem.

I am fairly new to Ubuntu and I was wonder what a good way is to debug when something crashes? \nFor example: I installed 11.04 and the default media player banshee makes my laptop crash after a few minutes of playing music. Since the system completely freezes and there is not error message it's hard to find out what is wrong.\nSecond problem I have is that sometimes the system crashes to login. I am suspecting it to be a Chromium or Flash but I am not 100% sure.\nSo anybody got some tips on how to debug stuff like this?\n\nA: All you have to do is to look at the log directory (/var/log/). You can find any crash or regular logs in there.\nSome applications can create crash logs in their own directories. For example, ~/.banshee in your home directory.\n\nA: Do not login using the login GUI after such a crash. Switch to a text-based login by pressing Ctrl + Alt + F1. Login with your username and password. Errors during a X session are appended to ~/.xsession-errors, but this file is overwritten every login. Make a backup of this file by executing:\nmv ~/.xsession-errors{,.1}\n\nThis will rename the .xsession-errors file to .xsession_errors.1. Replace the .1 if you want a different suffix. You can now logout from this shell by executing exit.\nCheck the system logfiles in /var/log. The most interesting files are:\n/var/log/kern.log\n/var/log/Xorg.0.log (for the current session)\n/var/log/Xorg.0.log.old (for previous session)\n/var/log/?dm.log (gdm for gnome, kdm for KDE)\n\n", "Q: Auto-hiding Gnome panel should be always on top -- Which gconf key to use?

It occurs on my system (11.04) from time to time but I can't properly reproduce it and don't have a reliable fix either. It's not a simple gconf setting.

In Ubuntu 10.10 I could enlarge the mouse pointer. In Ubuntu 11.04 I cannot find the option.\n\nA: Due to a bug in compiz the mouse pointer size or pointer theme can be changed in Unity but may only work in some circumstances (e.g. Firefox).\nFor GNOME classic and Unity desktop the option to change the mouse pointer size or style is found in System Settings -> Appearance -> Theme -> Customize -> Pointer:\n\nPush the slider at the bottom to the desired size.\n\nA: Workarounds for the bug in Unity are now referred to on the bug page however your mileage may vary. \nNone of them had any positive effect in my system.\nUnfortunate fail for Ubuntu, given that this is a longstanding issue, degrades the claim that Ubuntu is flexible or mainstream ready.\n", "Q: After Natty 11.04 installation system won't boot my notebook is an Acer Extensa 2902LMi with following components:\nPentium M 715\nIntel 855PM chipset\nIntel PRO/Wireless 2200BG\nATI MOBILITY RADEON 9700 64 VRAM\n512MB RAM\nI run Ubuntu 10.04 LTS for month without any problems on my notebook.\nNow I want to upgrade to Ubuntu 11.04.\nI booted from the Ubuntu 11.04 LiveCD without any problems.

Is that possible with a \"Windows Anytime Upgrade\" disc that I got from my manufacturer (Toshiba) and with a genuine license key for Windows?\n\nA: Yes, Windows will have no problem overwriting your current configuration. It doesn't even try to play nice if you have a dual-boot setup either.\n\nA: Why not to use both Operating Systems? Ubuntu can be installed without removing vista, and if you want to go back to have only vista, you just delete the partition where you have ubuntu; that way, you save the time installing vista.\n\nA: I'd suggest installing Ubuntu as a dual-boot setup, where you have both operating systems available. The Ubuntu installer can resize the existing windows partition to make room for Ubuntu to fit on the same harddrive. Ubuntu can mount the windows drive also, so you can store files on both partitions.\nAbout reinstalling windows, I'm not 100% sure if it can be done with an upgrade disc.

If you still have some problems it's probably gnome2 settings are broken.\nMy fix for this is:\nLogout, switch to command line (alt+ctrl+f1), login.\nin your /home/ backup those dirs and then remove them (just mv them somewhere):\n.gnome .gnome2 .gconf .gconfd .metacity\nSwitch back to X (alt+ctrl+f7), cry over your lost settings, try to restore them if you have some time to compare default and backup you made in the previous step.\n\nA: I had similar situation with some wrong compiz settings; try logging from another user, if it helps, you can reset some settings from main profile too.\n", "Q: Navigating between app icons in Unity with the keyboard I just installed Ubuntu with Unity-2d inside VMWare. I press Super to search for an app, I start typing something like \"te\" and then get a bunch of apps. How do I navigate between them with the keyboard?\nEDIT: Please don't post an answer before you verified that it works. I want to know which keys actually work, not which keys are supposed to work.\n\nA: You can use the arrow keys to navigate.\nFor example, if I wanted to open Gedit, I could press super then type 'ge'.\n\nThen I would press ↓. This would highlight the 'See x more results' text.\n\nThen I would press ↓ again. This would highlight the first application.\n\nThen I would press → to select the second application (Gedit) and press enter to launch.\n\nSummary\nIf an item in a row is highlighted, you can press the ←→ items to move between them.\nYou can move between rows with the ↑↓ buttons. Initially no row is selected so you need to press ↓ until an item in the first row is selected. You can use the tab key to move between all possible selections.\n", "Q: How to verify whether I have updated from beta to stable? I has been using Ubuntu 11 Beta, I want to verify I have the stable version. I read that I should use update manager to update, and read that the was supposed to be an \"upgrade platform\" or similar button, something I used when I updated from Ubuntu 10.10 to 11 beta. But this time, I dont see that, just normal updates. I tried \ncat /etc/issue \nUbuntu 11.04 \\n \\l\n\nIs it the latest?\n\nA: When shifting from the BETA release of Ubuntu to the current release there is no upgrade process - all that happens is an update of the packages. You can verify that you've \"upgraded\" by simply running the Update Manager and refreshing it for a check\nSystem > Administration > Update Manager\nAlternatively you can open a Terminal and at the prompt type\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade\n\nThat will make sure you've fetched the latest updates from the repositories, then perform any available upgrades.\n\nA: This time there will be no \"upgrade platform\" button. Just normal updates. That's OK though, if you installed all updates, your ubuntu will be the stable release. That's because the transition from 11.04 beta and 11.04 stable is smooth, and there are no major system changes nedded, just few normal updates.\n", "Q: Download deb packages with download manager instead of apt? Hi there I know that deb packages I downloaded are in: /var/cache/apt/archives/\nAnd I can save them for future use. However, there is a problem when I download a package using the apt-get command, download speed is too slow. When I download files with a download manager I can get up to 1MB/s!\nHow can I get the URL of the package and download it with a download manager?\n\nA: You can find the packages you want to download (and their dependencies) on the Ubuntu Packages site. Though it's not recommended - you should be able to gather the links from there and use a download manager to retrieve them.\n\nDependencies are listed first, then the download section is shown below the related packages\nIf you're having slow download times from the official mirrors - try updating your mirror location as it may be that the particular mirror you're fetching from is far away or having latency issues.\n\nA: synapitc allows you to save url download list, then you can supply it to download manager. you can also save your selection. later load the download list to synaptic.\n", "Q: Is it possible to use an alternate CD as LiveCD? I've used the alternate CD for installing my system. When I boot from the CD, I do not see a \"Live\" option as in the Desktop CD. Do I really need this desktop CD for a Live session, or is it possible with the Alternate CD as well?\n\nA: No, the alternate CD is not a live CD\n\nA: No, The Alternative cd - is useful for low end, or other problem systems. It does not work as a Live Desktop.  It can work as a upgrade cd, which can be a handy feature. You could use its console to do some repairs also.\n", "Q: How to get compiz cube effect to work in classic mode? I installed CCSM (Configure Compiz with CompizConfig) and configure to use effects, desktop cube and rotate cube. But It does not work on my laptop, MSI CR420.\nI don't use compiz on Unity (NN 11.04). I configure compiz on Ubuntu Classic(NN 11.04) session and want to use it on that session only.\n\nA: I didnt like UNITY as well; so i run Ubuntu Classic, also NN 11.04...\nI already installed CCSM (CompizConfig Settings Manager); and desktop cube only shows 2 of the 4 workspaces i use...

This makes sense in a netbook or other limited gui contexts but it an unnecessary optimisation for large desktop displays, is it possible to change this behaviour?, if not, why not?, it seems to go against the culture of Linux to restrict the tweaking users can apply to their systems\n\nA: It works the way you want to me. When the application is maximized, the menu bar combines with the superior bar, but when you restore the window, it has its own bar, so it seems to be configurable since it works different to us. I was having troubles with unity so I did unity --restart and restarted the system. maybe that can help.

Since Banshee became the default player in Natty, I want to import my playlists from Rhythmbox. Banshee offers an 'import playlists' feature but it does not recognize Rhythmbox's playlists (in folder home/user/.local/share/rhythmbox).\n\nA: The ~/.local/share/rhythmbox playlists are on a playlists.xml file. I think Banshee can't import .xml files, but .pls files, wich are the default Rhythbox playlists format when you SAVE them. \nSo I believe you have to install Rhythmbox, save every playlist and then, import them from Banshee. I might be wrong, but I think it's the only option.\n\nA: You need to export your playlist from Rhythmbox to a file (in .m3u or .pls format) before you can import this file in Banshee.\n", "Q: How long does it take for Ubuntu One to sync my files?

Almost two hours later I get a popup saying that the files are getting downloaded. How long does it take on average?\n\nA: There are a couple options for getting more info to help you determine how long your sync is taking.\nu1sdtool\nFrom the command line you can get the number of items in the queue with this command run in the terminal:\nu1sdtool --waiting | wc -l\n\nOvertime the number will get smaller as files are uploaded/downloaded.\nmagicicada\n\nThere is also a project called Magicicada that is a GUI for the Ubuntu One syncdaemon.

Is it possible to browse by genre in Banshee? Per default I only see browsing enables by artist and album. Can the browser be configured to support genres as well?\n\nA: Currently, Banshee doesn't have genre browsing by default and there is no way that I know to enable a genre browser like there is one for artists.\nHowever, you can get very close to this functionality by using smart playlists.\nTo create a new smart playlist go to Media -> New Smart Playlist.\n\nYou can select Genre from the dropdown menu in the dialog window. \n\nUsing 'Genre | contains | genre_text' works really well. For example, if you want to play all of your Thrash Metal, you could use 'Genre | contains | Thrash'.\n\nYou can then select the smart playlist along with all of your other playlists in the left hand column.\n\nThere is a slight problem with this approach however. You can't select multiple playlists at once like you can with artists. You can work around this problem by creating playlists for combinations of genres. Use the drop down menu to choose to 'Match [any] of the following' and use the plus button to add another query.\nHere I have created a playlist for all heavy metal and thrash metal.\n\nThis works to give you a playlist containing both of these genres.\n\n\nA: You can search by genre. To find all your Thrash Metal, type genre:Thrash in the banshee search field. The same works also for other fields.\n\nA: I'm sure you already knew this, but just for good measure. A method of sorting by genre, is to right-click on the sort-by columns, and add genre. \n\n\nA: You can, now, categorise your music by genre. Just select 'View' from the menu, then select 'Browser Content' and check 'Show Genre by Filter'.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 11.04 install did not work? I have a laptop that has Windows 7 64-bit as the main OS. I originally installed Ubuntu 10.10 using Wubi so I could have Windows and Linux to choose from at boot up. All worked great up until yesterday when I tried to install Ubuntu 11.04 using Wubi.\nNow after the install when I rebooted the Windows boot manager has the option to choose Windows or Ubuntu, when I choose Ubuntu this is what it says:\nWindows failed to start. A recent hardware or software change might be the cause. To fix the problem:\n 1. Insert your windows installation disc and restart your computer. \n 2. Choose your language settings, and then click \"Next\". \n 3.

From there any time I tried to install Ubuntu from CD or Wubi no positive result, it just would not take the install. \nIt would look as though it would install but upon reboot, no GRUB, it would boot back into Windows like nothing was ever installed.

When I installed 10.10, I decided to set up a separate partition for my /home directory. Will Ubuntu automatically detect my separate /home partition and use it in Natty? If not, what can I do to configure this?\n\nA: You can boot with the live cd or live-usb and when you reach the screen where it asks you where to install, the last option will allow you to set the partitions manually.\nThere, you select each partition and tell the installer where to mount each one.\nFor me is this:\n/dev/sda1 format ext4 mount point: / \n/dev/sda6 NO FORMAT ext4 mount point: /home\n/dev/sda5 swapp\nThe important thing is to identify correctly the partitions. If you want to be sure you can do:\nsudo fdisk -l\nand\ncat /etc/fstab\nin maverick to know what partitions you have and where are they mounted.\nIf the partitions are allready in ext4, the installer wont try to format it. Be sure you check the \"format\" option in the partition than you choose to be the root, and most important, DO NOT CHECK the format option in the partition that's gonna be your home. This way the installation will be completely clean but your home will remain.\nAlso, when it asks you for name and password be sure to use exactly the same you're using in the previous installation.\nOne last thing. Since you make a clean install (not an upgrade) when you log in you'll probably see errors like \"can't load applet...\" because probably you have applets and programs set on the startup than the clean install CD doesn't include. Don't worry, install them in synaptic and the next time you log in they'll be there.\nGood luck!\n\nA: When using the upgrade method (so not booting any install media) which I'm assuming you are doing, you don't have to do anything special. It will work just fine and stay the way you want it to be.\n", "Q: No tab bar or application menu or Unity I just had a notification that a new version of Ubuntu pop up today, and after looking at some screen shots, I decided to give it a try.  After I installed it and rebooted, the Top and bottom bar are gone, leaving only the desktop.  I can use the links on the desktop (that's how I started my browser), but the application's menu is gone.  How do I fix it?\nEDIT:\nIf I run unity from bash, it seems to work alright.  There still is no tab bar at the bottom, I don't know if that's normal for unity.\n\nA: Have a go at logging out from the system. Then when you choose your user at the bottom of the screen you can choose a different session. Try ubuntu-classic and see if you get the panels back. I had a similar problem when playing around with compiz. To solve it opened up the compiz manager, choose preferences, from the drop down chose unity then hit the \"Reset to defaults\" button.\nEither way, to access a terminal without panels double click a folder on your desktop (if you have one). Then navigate yourself to /usr/share/applications. In there you should find Terminal.\nHope some of the above stuff helps.\n\nA: No \"bottom bar\" is normal for Unity. It has been replaced by the 'launcher', located on the left border of the screen by default.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 11.04 wireless network problem In my notebook, update my ubuntu to 11.04.

I've been trying for a while now to change the e start-here icon that I have from the Elementary icon theme. I've replaced every start-here icon in the theme's folder, but I was told that Ubuntu also keeps a cache file, which may be the reason my changes do not take effect. How can I properly purge this \"icon cache\"?\n\nA: Run gtk-update-icon-cache in the run dialogue or a terminal.\nIf that doesn't fix it, try changing the \"distributor-logo\" icon.\n", "Q: Screen flashing, application bar disappearing, mouse freezes in Gnome I recently installed Ubuntu 11 64 bit server on my Power Edge 1650.  When Gnome loads, I receive no flickering of any sort -- everything looks beautiful.  I can login just fine.\nHowever, after the desktop loads, the application bar disappears and I can't click anything.  It remains gone, though I can move the mouse.  It flashes up for a second, until I move the mouse, and then the process repeats over again -- with everything disappearing.  I can't use commands until the application appears.  For instance, Ctrl+Alt+F1 won't work until the application bar reappears.\nAll software is brand new out of the box, with default configurations.  It feels like a video card configuration, but this isn't just some desktop computer I've loaded ubuntu on -- it's a popular server-class blade, so I'm not sure why this would be happening?\nThis is my first experience with Gnome and Ubuntu (and linux) -- I have no experience, and my searches are of little help.  Any help is appreciated.\nAs another note, I received a message saying something along the lines of hardware not supported for unity the first time I loaded the GUI.\n\nA: I was able to turn fix this issue by logging in to the classic Ubuntu environment after I selected my user name.  The flashing and issues went away.\n", "Q: Calendar not working in Thunderbird I have done a fresh install of Ubuntu 11.04, and then installed Thunderbird. I have tried to install two extensions, Lightning and then Provider for Google Calendar. Neither add-on will show up in the add-ons menu after the install and reboot of Thunderbird. I have installed Lightning both manually by downloading the .xpi file from the add-ons site and also trying the built-in utility for downloading add-ons in the Thunderbird menu.\nIts strange that the ubuntu repositories does not have thunderbird-lightening installed in it. \n\nA: The lightning extension is now available from the repositories for 11.04 (natty), 11.10 (oneiric) and 12.04 (precise)\nBy installing xul-ext-lightning thunderbird will have a calendar available to add events etc.\nsudo apt-get install xul-ext-lightning\n\nNote - you may be warned about installing the add-on when launching thunderbird up-to-three times.  Each time, tick the box to install the add-on and click the Restart Thunderbird button.\n\n\nA: The Question\nDo you have the Mozilla Team's Ubuntu ppa in your repository? You need to have that to be able to use the newest Thunderbird version and subsequently the Lightning and Google Calendar add-ons.\n\nAdding the repository\nTo get the latest Thunderbird Client version (5.0) first open up your terminal and copy/paste in the following lines.\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:mozillateam/thunderbird-stable\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install thunderbird\n\nIf you've already installed Thunderbird but haven't yet grabbed the Mozilla Team's repository until now Thunderbird will just be automatically updated rather than un-installed and then re-installed nor will you lose any of your current settings, extensions, and themes etc. \n\nDepending upon the developer and how fast they push release updates for their extensions you might have to go without some of them for a while as the devs catch up to the new version and update the extensions they manage.\nOk after you grab the repository and install the latest Thunderbird you should be able to open up the Add-ons section and install both Lightning and the Provider for Google Calendar without trouble. After you set them up etc restart Thunderbird and it all should still be there... If not, I'd recommend you file a bug report because that would be one in my opinion...

Is there any reason why this is missing from Unity? It's a really helpful thing to have when you have a lot of windows open.\n\nA: I've the same problem, but I found tint2. It is a bottom bar with all yours opened windows, it is available on main Ubuntu repo, and you can install it with\nsudo apt-get install tint2\n\nTo help configure tint2 you can use this python based gui:\nwget http://tintwizard.googlecode.com/files/tintwizard-0.3.4.tar.gz\ntar -zxvf tintwizard-0.3.4.tar.gz\n./tintwizard.py\n\nSource: http://www.tuxgarage.com/2011/10/running-tint2-under-unity.html\n\nA: A quite convenient alternative to a windows list is the windows preview inbuilt in the Unity Launcher. A minimized preview of all windows opened by a certain application is shown when clicking on its launcher icon. This is shown here on Unity 2D for three LibreOffice windows opened at the same time:\n\nJust click on the window you want to work on to have it opened on top.\nNote that all running applications that have a window opened are marked with tiny white dots on the left side of their panel icon.\n\nA: Press Super+W to see window previews from the current workspace and Super+Shift+W to see those from all workspaces. You can close each window just by a middle click on it.\n\n(Hold down Super by itself for a list of shortcuts that can help sort windows.)\n\nA: Unity is a dock-based interface, the dock replaces the taskbar usually found on the gnome-panel. If i were you i would log in with a classical mode rather than Unity, which will provide the gnome-panel and taskbar, and if you do want a dock, you can use Docky or Cairo-Dock. The latter will allow you more cutomisation.\n\nA: There is also,\nUnity Window Quicklists\n\nUnity Window Quicklists displays a list of open windows as quicklists\n  for each application on the Unity launcher, and you can use them to\n  switch between those windows.

What I did not originally realize is that when I click on the appropriate icon in the dock, the multiple instances of the application are graphically depicted as window previews.  From there it is simply a matter of selecting the instance in which I am interested. \n", "Q: Duplicating gtk treeviews how can I use views from .ui file many times?\nI load them this way\nvar view_orig = builder.get_object(\"items_view\") as Gtk.TreeView;\nvar store_orig = builder.get_object(\"items_store\") as Gtk.TreeStore;\n\nbut I need create 10 copies of view_orig.\nI write it in Vala.\n\nA: You usually wouldn't use a ui file as a template (in the sense of duplication). The only method I know is to traverse the Gtk object tree and duplicate each object you come across. Depending on how complex your tree is you might be able to get away with just looking through and duplicating the classes without any data.\nI know of no convenience functions for helping you do this. And a gnome developer would probably tell you to create a factory class to build the ui or load the ui file multiple times (I believe the builder creates a new tree on each load)\n", "Q: Upgrade to 11.04 freezes on boot i saw a couple of threads about upgrade problems. but none i found that is similar to my issue.\ni upgraded from 10.10. after all the upgrades/updates and went to reboot. the system would freeze when starting the services, i would turn it off and on again. the freeze is random. i.e. starting apache2 [ok]..then later..checking battery state..then later..starting nfs [ok]...\ni went to recovery mode and removed some of the services. but it still wont work.\nany ideas how to go fix this?\nthx!\njoey\n\nA: I have the same problem. I can manage to boot by using an older Linux version from the GRUB menu (try going back 1 version). That should let it boot, but there are obviously other problems which I don't yet know how to solve.\nEdit: I managed to solve the problem by reinstalling Ubuntu.

The option selected for a network connection is not highlighted enough so it is very hard to know which one is selected. In the following picture you can see the example where no option appears brighter than the others so i do not know which one is the one selected in case where i want to share a connection or have several connection options available.\n\nUPDATE - Just in case nobody noticed. The Intel* and **Auto Ethernet options can both be selected using the first card there (The Wired Intel 8255DC-2). The problem is that the Auto Ethernet does not appear highlighted or brighter than the Intel option which can also be selected with the same NIC. Do not confuse the picture with the gray options. You can even notice that the Disconnect option is the same bright white than the \"Selected\" option.\nUPDATE2 - In the following image from Ubuntu 10.10 you can see that the highlighted connection is more BLACK than the rest. In my case, in the original theme, the option should be more WHITE than the rest.\n\nUbuntu 11.04 with more options to show what i mean.\n\nAs you can see in the image, the Intel connection has the same color than the Shared and Realtek ones. If i had more it would confuse more the problem since with a quick glance i would not be able to find the one used at the moment.\nSo what option do i need to edit to change the selected connection to a brighter color?\n\nA: There is no problem in your picture, the greyed out menu items are the ones that are not selected. The Auto Eth0 is the one you are connected to.\n\nA: Change the theme by right clicking the desktop and clicking Change Desktop Backgroud, click the theme tab and select one you like -- I would suggest Radiance.\n", "Q: How to make Banshee notification in Ubuntu 11.04 show the playlist by default I want to be able to play music with Banshee without the need to open it after i have already made my Playlist.

I created an ext4 partition to back-up my files to, and partitioned it for 102GB in Gparted using a live USB. After I booted into Ubuntu, I opened Disk Utility, and it said that the partition was actually 108GB. Confused, I opened the mounted partition in Nautilus, and it said the partition was only 98GB.\nWhich is correct? Did I partition it wrong?\n\nA: If I remember correctly, Nautilus as switched to using base-10 representations of data (rather than the actual base-two conversion) whereby 1GB equals 1,000,000,000 bytes instead of 1,073,741,824 bytes.\nThis doesn't explain the difference between gparted and whatever the disk actually is though.\n\nA: I never can get the Numbers straight, but i think it can be summarized as  having to do with one using 'GiB' vs the other using 'GB'  \nI guess you could think of it in a way akin to the Metric system vs the Non-metric sytem.\nA quick snippit from wikipedia. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibibyte\nThe gibibyte is a standards-based binary multiple (prefix gibi, symbol Gi) of the byte, a unit of digital information storage. The gibibyte unit symbol is GiB.1\n**1 gibibyte =** 230 bytes = 1073741824bytes = 1024 mebibytes\n\nThe gibibyte is closely related to the gigabyte, which is defined as 109 bytes = 1000000000bytes, but has been used as a synonym for gibibyte in some contexts (see binary prefix.) In terms of standard gigabytes, 1GiB ≈ 1.074GB.\nYou often see people confused about the size of the Ubuntu ISO files, the size listed on a web site or ftp server seems to be 'bigger' then a 700mb due to how different systems use  GiB or GB.\n", "Q: How to drag an image to the side panel to open with Chrome When i drag an image (In this case an png) all elements in the Panel go gray except for Firefox.

As I was looking at it, I discovered that my system had the same problem as yours after upgrading to Natty, yesterday. I believe the problem is that the UUID of the swap partition changed during the upgrade. Here is how I fixed it.\n\n\n*\n\n*Run sudo blkid. This will show the current UUID's of all partitions on the disk. I suspect you will see that the UUID of your swap partition now differs from the value in /etc/fstab.\n\n*If it is different, run some text editor under sudo to edit /etc/fstab. Replace the value of the UUID with the current actual value as shown by the blkid command, above. Do not include the quotation marks.\n\n*Save the file and reboot your system. Run free -m to make sure the change fixed the problem:\n$ free -m\n             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached\nMem:          1001        604        396          0        123        199\n-/+ buffers/cache:        281        719\nSwap:         1953          0       1953\n\n\nA: This is going to sound stupid, but try it: reorder /etc/fstab to put the swap partition last.\nIt seems that mountall -v fails harmlessly when run as NON-root user, and its output can be used to diagnose why mountall doesn't work right at boot.  Your last line of output from mountall -v includes the critical clue:\nlocal 4/4 remote 0/0 virtual 12/12 swap 0/0\n\nIn other words, 0 swap drives mounted, 0 swap drives found in /etc/fstab.\nNow why didn't mountall find your swap drive listed in /etc/fstab?  Good question.  This should probably be a bug against mountall.  To diagnose it, I copied your /etc/fstab and ran mountall -v as non-root user.  By editing /etc/fstab randomly and continuing to test mountall -v, I found how to change mountall's reported \"swap 0/0\".  Just reordering the lines of /etc/fstab was enough to make it change to \"swap 0/1\", in other words, 1 swap drive found in /etc/fstab.  With that, it may be enough to boot properly.  If not, please post new result of mountall -v.\n\nA: I had a similar problem on Ubuntu 12.04 (Precise), but my /etc/fstab was already correct.  It turns out that there was something broken about the format of my swap partition that prevented blkid and mountall from detecting the swap partition.\nDetails:\n\n\n*\n\n*My swap partition was /dev/mapper/foo-swap_1 -- an LVM logical volume on an encrypted (LUKS) partition.\n\n*The swap partition would never be active at boot.\n\n*Manually running swapon -a worked.\n\n*lsblk showed the swap partition\n\n*blkid did NOT show the swap partition\n\n*blkid -p /dev/mapper/foo-swap_1 printed the following message:\n/dev/mapper/foo-swap_1: ambivalent result (probably more filesystems on the device, use wipefs(8) to see more details)\n\n\n*wipefs -n /dev/mapper/foo-swap_1 showed TWO different filesystem signatures!\nNuking both signatures (wipefs -a) and reformatting the swap (mkswap) fixed the problem for me.\nHere's a script that automates the fix:\n#!/bin/sh\n\n# helper functions\nlog() { printf %s\\\\n \"$*\"; }\nerror() { log \"ERROR: $*\" >&2; }\nfatal() { error \"$*\"; exit 1; }\ntry() { \"$@\" || fatal \"'$*' failed\"; }\n\n# path to the swap partition\nSWAP=/dev/mapper/foo-swap_1\n\n# remember the UUID of the swap partition\nUUID=$(try sed -e 's/RESUME=UUID=//' /etc/initramfs-tools/conf.d/resume) || exit 1\n[ -n \"${UUID}\" ] || fatal \"couldn't read UUID\"\n\n# delete filesystem/raid signatures from the swap partition\ntry wipefs -a \"${SWAP}\"\n\n# format the swap partition\ntry mkswap -f -U \"${UUID}\" \"${SWAP}\"\n\n\nA: I don't have any quick answer, but I poked around and found some things you could check to try to narrow down the problem:\n\n*\n\n*/etc/fstab(5) should list swap partition (yours looks fine afaict)\n\n*/etc/init/mountall.conf should include the line emits all-swaps\n\n*if you run mountall as non-root user, its reply should include swapon: /dev/sda5: open failed: Permission denied\n\n*dmesg | less should include something like what mine has:\n\n\n[    2.272092]  sda: sda1 sda2 sda3\n[    2.272924] sd 1:0:0:0: [sda] Attached SCSI disk\n...(more lines about mounting sda1, sda2)...\n[   20.298550] Adding 10239996k swap on /dev/sda3.

I was unaware my swap partition wasn't working until I tried to Gimp a 14 megapixel jpg from my Olympus e330. Yikes.\nForums to the rescue. Clues:\nblkid shows\n/dev/sdb6: UUID=\"3e0550cf-4a55-4aa8-80fa-24103c1b25a7\" TYPE=\"swap\" \n\nbut it is not active according to System Monitor, mmm'kay.\nThe UUID was definitely right but no go... not sure how I got to this command:\n# blkid -p /dev/mapper/foo-swap_1\nerror: /dev/mapper/foo-swap_1: No such file or directory\n\nFile manager showed me a 0 byte icon, filename control, -- so what was supposed to be written there? By what?\n$ sudo swapon --all --verbose yielded\nswapon: cannot find the device for UUID=3e0550cf-4a55-4aa80fa-24103c1b25a7\n\nI edited the /etc/fstab file adding\n/dev/sdb6   none    swap    sw  0   0\n\nReboot and System  Monitor shows it active, yay.\nOK, I must have been here and found the command\nblkid -p /dev/mapper/foo-swap_1\n\nSo it's a clue for someone smarter than me. Hope it helps.\n\nA: Nothing above was in my case\nI resized swap: deleted old one and then made a new one bigger. After there was an error Something X session related. I changed UUID in /etc/fstab, but it did not work for me. Checked journal: ... unknown filesystem \"swap\"\nSolution: in /etc/fstab change ext4 to swap for /swap and reboot\n\nA: My /etc/fstab (Debian) has the following content:\nUUID=7b533ab9-cb87-4a30-a4d8-689788f21985 none  swap sw 0 0\n\nYours should have that line based on what you told us about your config:\n/dev/sda5 none swap sw 0 0\n\nI wonder why as a beginner in Linux you're wondering about this. RAM is cheap these days. I've got 4 GB, and do Java development (IntelliJ especially uses a ton of RAM for example) but I never run out of it.\nAnd I have to say I'm surprised you've got this kind of problems.\nDid you not run the Ubuntu Installer using default options?\nOr maybe you're getting all these problems because of dual booting (Win/Lin)?\n\nA: After UUID:\n# Turn off swap\nswapoff \"${SWAP}\"\nAt the end:\nswapon \"${SWAP}\"\n", "Q: 3D compiz effects choppy and slow.

Same for empathy, ktorrent and any other program. In ubuntu 10.10 for example i would do an ALT+F2 and then i just type ged and the launcher would see what GUI programs i had for ged (Since gedit was the only one) the launcher would open gedit. Same for typing ktorrent. I would only need to type kto or for empathy only emp. Quicker and you do not need to type the whole thing. more friendlier if you ask me.\nFor what i see right now, dash has something that the previous launcher did not, you can type torrent and he would mention ktorrent the result list. This would not have worked in the previous one since the word you start typing is how the launcher assumes the command starts.\nDash only needs the option to execute the first GUI program that resembles the word typed. With ged he should be able to open gedit instead of trying to execute the command ged. With emp he should be able to open empathy when i press enter and so on..\nHow can i change the behavior of this so it works as the previous launcher.\nUPDATE: The problem arises when i use ALT+F2 instead of the SUPER key. Both will make DASH (At least the visual Dash) but it will not behave the same.\nThe following images show ALT+F2 DASH and SUPER DASH\n\nALT+F2 DASH  \n\nSUPER DASH\nAS you can see, when using the ALT+F2 method it does not show the correct GUI tools. When using the SUPER method it does. This was the problem. Now how do i make it so both behave the same way. The SUPER method does not appear on the Keyboard Shortcuts.\n\nA: The difference is:\nALT+F2 DASH - Shows all commands including terminal ones and does not try to guess the command.\nSUPER DASH - Shows only GUI programs and tries to guess what program you want to run depending of the amount you use them.\nGot to this answer after testing for almost 2 days.\n\nA: I would not advise trying to change the behavior of Alt+F2 since Alt+F2 is intended to be used to execute commands.  If you want autocompletion, use the super button (windows key) instead.  Changing the Alt+F2 command to behave like the super command would make it more difficult for you to do something complicated like cd /foo/bar/ ; cut [options] <baz | tee qux >quux, as the super dash won't accept commands like that, and the alt+F2 dash wouldn't be accessible via a shortcut.  You'd have to open a terminal.\n\nA: Is this because gedit's launcher is actually named \"Text Editor\"? If it is, two possible solutions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Rename the launcher to call it \"gedit\" - You know what \"gedit\" means so it's hardly a usability issue for you.\n\n*Create a script in ~/bin/ called g or ged that launches gedit. Then you just have to pump that in, hit return and it'll call that script.\n\n", "Q: How to/When sync gmail contacts with ubuntu one?

I had a bad experience on an old Dell computer where shortly after installing Ubuntu on it, the hard drive failed due to excessive loading/unloading cycles. What is the best way to check the health of my hard drive in Ubuntu? Can it be done from the command line?\n\nA: There is also a utility called badblocks, and another called shred. Both of these utilities can perform read/write operations on your write drive that can be used to make sure that a drive is safe for use. Personally, if I saw an error in either of these I'd replace the drive.\nThey are very slow and can take some time to complete, but can give you a an idea of their health. Also, since they are writing you'll lose the data on the drive and should be run from live cd as suggested by caesay. I've been lugging around SystemRescueCd lately.\n\nA: For the desktop, you can use \"Disk Utility\" (aka palimpsest or gnome-disks depending on the Ubuntu release) for this.\nFor the command line I suggest you install the smartmontools package and play around with smartctl.

The command for restarting Gnome2 is:\nsudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart\n\nWhat is the equivalent for Unity?\n\nA: The command unity can be used to restart unity. It restarts the window manager, so your open programs will stay intact and you will not be logged out.\nIf you run the command from a terminal app, you should add & disown to detach it from the terminal. If you don't, then the unity program will become a child process of the terminal app such that when you close the terminal, unity will also close.\nIt might also be worthwhile to add &> /dev/null (before the disown bit) so that text and error output does not clutter your terminal.\nSo, the command is:\nunity &> /dev/null & disown\n\nIf you can't open the terminal application due to the desktop being extremely unresponsive (or any other reason), you can open a purely text-based terminal by hitting alt-ctrl-F1 through F6. \nThere you will get a text terminal, you have to login first.\nThen you can run the command above, then hit alt-ctrl-F7 or alt-ctrl-F8 to come back to the graphical desktop.\nThis tends to fix \"hanging\" problems.\nAs a side note: since Unity is a compiz plugin, you can restart unity by restarting compiz using the command:\ncompiz --replace\n\nIf you run it from the alt-ctrl-F1 terminal, you will need a --display parameter\ncompiz --display :0 --replace\n\nYou'll still need to add & disown\n\nA: In Ubuntu 13.04 you can use the following:\nsudo service lightdm restart\n\n\nA: The Upstart way is \nsudo service lightdm restart for newer versions using lightdm\nor sudo service gdm restart for older versions using gdm.\nUpdate:\nAnother option, which isn't using the terminal but using a key combination, can be found at How to set keyboard combination to kill the X server?\n\nA: In a terminal, run nohup compiz --replace. The nohup command will make sure compiz isn't closed when you close the terminal. \n\nA: The command to restart GDM is sudo stop gdm followed by sudo start gdm, and should be done from a tty.\nIf you are trying to restart unity itself just run unity (but remember you need to do this from the run dialog.\n\nA: You don't need to open a tty.

These hd files contain b-frames, which makes it quite hard to edit them because scrubbing the timeline goes all jittery. \nUsing Avidemux, I've experimented with various codecs: Huffyuv, H.264, FFV1 and FFVHuff. The container format mainly being .avi, and turning \"Create OpenDML files\" made it possible to create huge .avi files. Earlier I had briefly tried my hand at using .mkv files, but Avidemux kept crashing. \nMy plan was to import the resulting lossless files into Blender, Kdenlive or Openshot, and it seems that FFVHuff was the only codec that made it possible to move around the timeline in a decent way (at least in Blender). However that was using smaller .avi files. \nJust now I tried bunching together five of the original files into a large 40gb .avi file encoded with the FFVHuff codec. I wasn't able to edit the resulting file in Blender nor Openshot. The program would just hang if I jumped to far out into the timeline and try to play the video. So, yeah. My question is at the top. Any assistance, greatly appreciated.\n\nA: Alright! After some trials I managed to find a functioning workflow for HD video editing using Blender and Avidemux.\nProcedure:\n\n\n*\n\n*Take the high-res footage and create additional low-res versions. What I do is use Avidemux to create .avi files encoded in m-jpeg format. Furthermore I also adjust the size of the low rez footage to 640x360px\n\n*Import high-res footage into Blender. Keep the project's import settings high-res, meaning the video settings you would like to export the project in.\n\n*When viewing the video sequencer timeline in Blender, select your high-res clips after importing them and press N. \n\n*Under each of the clips, find \"proxy\" and check it. Afterwards you check and select \"proxy custom file,\" where you then select the corresponding low-res file. \n\n*And if you hover over the Sequencer View you will be able to press N, to see various render settings for that view. I like to select \"proxy size 25%\" under \"proxy rend.\"\n\n\nPS. You do not have to uncheck the proxies before exporting your finished project, Blender is smart enough to handle that automatically. \nCheers! :)\n", "Q: Root filesystem check fails after power failure during installation During the \"install\" phase of the upgrade there was a power failure. After when starting up again the following errors are reported:\ninit: udevtrigger main process (420) terminated with status 1\ninit: udevtrigger post-stop process (428) terminated with status 1\ninit: udevmonitor main process (419) killed by TERM signal\nThe disk drive for / is not ready yet or not present\nContinue to wait; or press S to skip mounting or M for manual recovery\n\nPressing M gives me the following message:\nRoot filesystem check failed.\nA maintenance shell will now be started.\nCONTROL-D will terminate this shell and reboot the system.\n\n\nA: I had the same situation happen -- power failure during upgrade.\nGet to the maintenance shell, and try this:\nsudo mount -o remount,rw /\nsudo  dpkg --configure -a\nsudo mount -o remount,ro /\nsudo sync\nsudo reboot\n\n(the remount/sync at the end is probably just paranoia, but just in case...)\n\nA: When you get to this root shell, type fdisk -l to get a list of the drives in the system, then do a fsck on the / (using it's name from the list, for example /dev/sd5 partition.\nTo force a disk check, use sudo fsck -f.\n\nA: I had the same problem (power failure during upgrade). In my case the system was frozen after showing the error message: pressing S or M (or any other key) didn't have any effect.\nI fixed it by following @scott-wood's instructions. Just a little addenda: to enter the maintenance shell you need to boot from a live disk and choose the options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Rescue a broken system;\n\n*Choose the device to use as root file system (typically the first entry);\n\n*Choose \"Execute a shell in /dev/...\" as rescue operation.\n\n\nI forgot to execute the mount and sync commands and the system recovered successfully, so I think it's safe to skip them.\nAt the end remember to reboot the system by running \"reboot\". Alternatively you need to exit the shell either by typing \"exit\" or pressing CTRL+D; once you are out of the shell, choose the option \"Reboot the system\".\n\nA: I experienced this error as well, but my problem (and thus the fix) were different.\nAfter installing Ubuntu 11.04 successfully, I ran a dist-upgrade.  For whatever reason, during the upgrade, it randomly changed the drive letter in /etc/fstab for all of my partitions that were not identified by UUIDs.\nEditing /etc/fstab and fixing the drive letter fixed the problem for me.\n", "Q: Is there a way to include NVIDIA drivers before installation? My laptop hates Nouveau, and to save me the bother of upgrading from 10.04 to 11.04 (as I did with 10.10) I was wondering if there was a way to modify an Ubuntu ISO to run on the nVidia drivers instead of having t to install them afterwards.\nI don't really want to switch to Mint, as I do love Unity.\nSo, is there a way for me to get/create an ISO with the nVidia drivers already installed and active?\nEDIT: LiveCD system won't boot with Nouveau, and installing through alternate or any other method results in Nouveau being activated after installation, leaving me with a black screen, aside from the cursor. Hence why I'm asking about getting the NVIDIA drivers up and running.\n\nA: Your problem is with nouveau so I'd suggest just blacklisting it so it never gets loaded. Normally speaking this would be done by editing /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf but that's not really feasible in a live setting.\nBut you can still do it using a boot parameter.\n\n\n*\n\n*Mash the keyboard as soon as the LiveCD starts booting (after BIOS). I mashed F6 (on a hunch) and it worked - but other keys will probably work too.\n\n*Select your language and press F6 again.\n\n*Press escape to get out of that submenu and you should be left with a boot parameter line.\n\n*Add disablemodules=nouveau after the --,  right at the end of the line and hit return.\n\n\nThis should get you to the desktop in VESA mode. From there you should be able to install.\nBefore you reboot, I suggest you mount the new installation and edit its etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf file to add blacklist nouveau on a new line. If you don't do this you can do it later by doing the disablemodules-route in grub. See the Boot Options help page for more on this.\nOnce you're sitting on your VESA version of the desktop, you can install the nvidia driver without any issue.\n\nAlternatively:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the alternate ISO and boot to that. This is a text-mode installer. Bit rawer in places but it should get Ubuntu installed.\n\n*Interfere with grub (as above) when you boot the first time.\n\n\nA: Have you tried booting the livecd / your installed alternative ISO desktop with the kernel command line option:\nnouveau.noaccel=1\n\nOr if this doesn't work, perhaps the good old:\nnouveau.modeset=0\n\nNouveau hard locks my MacBook Pro 5,1 when booting but using the noaccel option allows it to boot successfully so it may work for you.\n", "Q: My system takes too long to boot is there a fix? i just installed Ubuntu 11.04 fresh install with Windows 7 already installed.. when i chose ubuntu from the grub menu it shows the purple screen for too long with no activity from the laptop then after a while it boots normally.

If it is a minute or more i suspect the ACPI. You could either shut it of from the Grub-menu or in the BIOS. The Grub way you will need go into edit mode by pressing \"e\" and at the row that say \"quiet splash\" add \"acpi=off\". Then press \"ctrl+x\" to boot. This is not a permanent solution. Try it first and if it work you could do it permanent.\n\nA: I had problem with login and boot time also, reason was in xorg.conf file configuration\nProblem was coming from synaptics touchpad, where the special .conf file was created to make a scrolling work.\nBelow is outtake from launchpad bug report my comment, how I made scrolling work\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/565543\n\nIt was annoying to be without scrolling, so created a file with name psmouse.conf in:\n/etc/modprobe.d\nwith text inside:\noptions psmouse proto=imps\nSaved and run through commands:\nsudo modprobe -r psmouse\nsudo modprobe psmouse\n\nAfter this my ALPS is detected as ImPS/2 Generic Wheel Mouse, but scrolling is working\n\nAfter making this, I totally forgot about xorg.conf, that I had a Section InputDevice with assigning a driver to my touchpad, what was creating and error, because after making scrolling to work my touchpad was recognized as imPS2 mouse, but not as Synaptics Touchpad... so it was causing the long LOGIN time and partly a boot time\nX was trying to find Synaptics Touchpad but there was imPS assigned Physically, so this so to speak searching time made an interface to stuck...\nSolution\nSimply comment out Section InputDevice and InputeDevice in Server Layout in xorg.conf\nIt solved the problem in my case, hope it will help someone\n", "Q: Messaging Menu Keyboard Shortcut In previous versions of Ubuntu, Super+M would open the messaging menu.

Whenever I open a .sh file, it opens it in gedit instead of the terminal. I can't find any option similar to Right Click → Open With → Other Application... → Terminal.\nHow do I open this file in the terminal?\n\nA: Give execute permission to your script:\nchmod +x /path/to/yourscript.sh\n\nAnd to run your script:\n/path/to/yourscript.sh\n\nSince . refers to the current directory: if yourscript.sh is in the current directory, you can simplify this to:\n./yourscript.sh\n\n\nA: There are a few ways to do this.\nOption 1\n\n\n*\n\n*In the terminal, access the directory the Bash file is in using cd (change directory).\nEx. cd Downloads\n\n*Run bash <filename>.sh\nThis also works with .run files. There is an example of this usage at this webpage on updating Rhythmbox.\nOption 2\n\n\n*\n\n*In the terminal, navigate to the directory the bash file is in.\n\n*Run chmod +x <filename>.sh\n\n*In Nautilus, open the file.\n\nA: Open a terminal and navigate to the folder where the .sh file is located.  Then type:\nsh <name of file>.sh\n\n\nA: 2 main steps.\n\n\n*\n\n*in terminal, use gedit to write and save script with \".sh\" extension to desktop.\n(but any text editor can be used)\n\n*open Nautilus and right click the script.sh file.\n\n\n*\n\n*under properties, check box \"allow executing file..\"\n\n*in Nautilus menu, click file,then preferences,then behaviour\n\n*check the \"run executable text files when they are opened\".\nNow, when you double click the file on the desktop, it should execute.\nno need for . or ./\n\nA: *\n\n*Right-click the .sh file and make it executable.\n\n*Open a terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T).\n\n*Drag the .sh file into the terminal window and watch in awe.\n\nA: In Ubuntu 16.04 this is how to open it in Terminal:\nGo to the File Manager > Edit > Preferences > Behavior for Executable Text Files and select  Ask each time.\nThe problem is that it's by default set to View Executable Files when they are opened.\n\nA: Prerequisite\nBefore you can run the .sh file, you need to make it executable: \n\n\n*\n\n*Right-click on the file\n\n*Select Properties\n\n*Select Permissions\n\n*Select Allow executing file as a program\nWarning\nMake sure you trust the source where you got the file from. It could be a virus.\nThe very simple way\n\n\n*\n\n*Double-click on the file\n\n*Click run in terminal\n\n\nThis has problem. The terminal will close immediately and you will not be able to see the output. \nThe simple way\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Applications -> Accessories -> Terminal\n\n*Drag and drop the .sh file into the terminal and press Enter\n\n\nThe way professionals do it\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Applications -> Accessories -> Terminal\n\n*Find where the .sh file\n\n\n*\n\n*Use the ls and cd commands\n\n*ls will list the files and folders in the current folder. Give it a try: type \"ls\" and press Enter.\n\n*Once you see the folder that you want to go in to, run cd, followed by a space, followed by a folder name\n\n*If you when into a folder that you did not want, run cd .. to go one level up\n\n\n*Run the .sh file\n\n\n*\n\n*Once you can see for example script1.sh with ls run this:\n./script.sh\n\nWhy do it the complicated way?\nThe terminal has a rich set of powerful tools that are accessible by typing the commands. Professionals locate the .sh file by typing ls and cd. Once you are in the correct current folder you can run the script like this:\n./script1.sh\n\nor you can run and redirect the output to a file:\n./script1.sh > out.txt\n\nor you can filter the output for keywords (e.g. \"apples\") an then redirect to a file:\n./script1.sh | grep apples > ./only-apples\n\nThere are thousands of things you can to to that file just by typing a few commands.\nAnother one, you can download a file from the Internet with one simple command:\nwget www.google.com/images/logos/ps_logo2.png\n\nAnd then open the file like this:\nshotwell ps_logo2.png\n\n\nA: If you place your shell script or other executable you create in /usr/local/bin it will be found and executed without having to provide a folder path in the command line or adding ./ to the name. For example I created the following simple 3 line bash script to display disk UUIDs:\n#!/bin/bash\necho \"* UUIDs must match in /etc/fstab and /boot/grub/menu.lst\"\nsudo blkid\n\nI called the file uuid and placed it in /usr/local/bin. All I need enter on the command line is:\nuuid\n\n\nA: On Ubuntu 13.04 executable files opened in Nautilus are now opened in gedit by default rather than prompting the user to execute them. To enable the classic behavior you need to adjust the preferences:\nNautilus → Edit menu → Preferences → Behaviour tab → Click the radio button near Ask each time.\n\nA: The problem I have found on a few distributions is they have hidden the preferences option in Nautilus, but to fix it in Ubuntu and other distributions using Gnome3 is the same (literally just done the Fedora version of this and posting the actual fix to remind me how in the future).\n\n\n*\n\n*Install dconf-editor\nsudo apt-get install dconf-editor\n\n\n*Run dconf-editor using the user account you want this on, i.e NOT root\ndconf-editor\n\n\n*Navigate to the following schema:\norg.gnome.nautilus.preferences\n\n*Change the default option to not open by default:\nFind executable-text-activation click the word display and change to ask\nthat will give you the option to edit, view or run the file going forward\n\nA: Well, I too faced the same problem. I wanted to execute the .sh file and it opened with Gedit on CentOS 7. So here is what I did:\n\n\n*\n\n*I navigated to the path of the .sh file I wanted to execute.\n\n*I opened the terminal.\n\n*And I simply dragged and dropped the on the terminal window and it automatically took that file along with the path as input.\n\n*Hit Enter and you are good to go!\n\n\nA: I am a noob in Linux and I just had the same problem. If all else fails:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open terminal\n\n*Open the folder containing the .sh file\n\n*Drag and drop the file into the terminal window\n\n*The file's path appears in terminal. Press Enter.\n\n*Voila, your .sh file is run.\n\n\nA: You need to mark shell scripts as executable to run them from the file manager:  \n\n\n*\n\n*Right click on your .sh file and select Properties:\n\n\n*In the Permissions tab, check Allow executing file as program:  \n\n\n*Close the Properties window and double-click the file. A dialog will pop up giving you the option to run the script in a terminal:  \n\n\nA: Go to the directory where the .sh file is by using cd. In this example I have stored my sh file as ~/Desktop/shell_practice/test.sh\nfirst do pwd to figure out where you are, and if it returns /home/username (where username is your real username), you can run\ncd Desktop/shell/practice\n\nIf you seem to be somewhere else, you can use the absolute path\ncd ~/Desktop/shell/practice\n\nor\ncd $HOME/Desktop/shell/practice\n\nor even\ncd /home/$USER/Desktop/shell/practice\n\nthese are all ways of describing the same place. Once you've made it to the location of your script, type\nls\n\nIf you can see the sh file in the output, you can use chmod to make it executable. In my case, remember, the filename is test.sh, so I would run\nchmod u+x test.sh\n\nNow that we are in the same directory as the script, we have to specify to the shell that we want to execute the file by giving its location ./ (the current directory followed by a path separator, to distinguish it from the filename). To run my file I would type:\n./test.sh\n\nIf your script has been written correctly it will run without errors...\nHere's a live example:\n\n\nA: For Ubuntu 18.04, There is a little modification, as you don't get a pop-up dialog.\nSo what you need to do is:\nRight click on Files, Select Preferences > Select Behavior Tab > Mark 'Ask what to do' option under Executable text file.\nNow, When you double-click on any .sh file, you will get a popup, there you can select \"run in terminal\" option to run your .sh file.\n\n\nA: You can also use . tricks, with the suggestion of other answers.\nFor example:\nchmod +x filename.sh, assuming you have already gone to the path to file then run the file with any one of these command:\nsh filename.sh\n\n./filename.sh\n\n. filename.sh\n\n", "Q: Installing Gearman on 10.04 I'm trying to install Gearman on a clean out of the box 10.04 server using the following commands:\nsudo apt-key adv --recv-keys --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install gearman-job-server libgearman2 libgearman-dev uuid-dev php5-dev\nsudo pecl install channel://pecl.php.net/gearman-0.7.0\n\nI've added the following to my /etc/apt/sources.list:\ndeb http://ppa.launchpad.net/gearman-developers/ppa/ubuntu lucid main\n\nBut I get the following error after I run the apt-get install:\nReading package lists… Done\nBuilding dependency tree\nReading state information… Done\nuuid-dev is already the newest version.\nphp5-dev is already the newest version.\nSome packages could not be installed.

Call it something logical, put it somewhere where you won't trip over it or accidentally move it. chmod +x it too.\n\n*Get your script to do what you want. I'll assume you mounted your writable Windows share as /mnt/win (mount it under /mnt/ if you don't want it show up in nautilus) and that you want these directories stored in ~/daily-backups/.\n#!/bin/bash\n\nSRC=\"/mnt/win\"\nOUT=\"~/daily-backups\"\nDATE=$(date '+%Y-%m-%d')\n\nNEWDIR=\"$OUT/$DATE\"\n\n# make the new directory for today and cd into it\nmkdir -p \"$NEWDIR\"\ncd \"$NEWDIR\"\n\ncp -R \"$SRC/*\" . # could use rsync\n\n\n*cron it up. Assuming your script is called ~/daily-backups/do-backups. Type crontab -e and in the editor add a new line like this:\n0 22 * * * ~/daily-backups/do-backups\n\nAnd that will run your script every day at 10pm. Obviously you might want to tune that to a more sentible time but I wouldn't leave it until midnight or the datestamp might get confusing.\n\nA: If you can put Cygwing on that Windows box then rsync (over ssh) and cron would be the standard solution.\nIt's not easy.\nSearch for \"backups with rsync\", this would come up first:\nhttp://www.mikerubel.org/computers/rsync_snapshots/ - a really good resource. Explains how to setup backups with snapshots (timestamps).\n", "Q: How do I remap the keyboard shortcut for Gnome Do? I am giving Unity a chance to win me over in Natty, but I admit I am a heavy Gnome Do user and Unity has remapped the Super+Space keyboard shortcut to show the Unity Launcher. \nI am not yet convinced with the new Unity Launcher and would like to keep using Gnome Do, at least until such time as I am convinced that the Unity launcher is as frictionless as Gnome Do.\nIs it possible to remap it to Gnome Do?\n\nA: *\n\n*Install compizconfig-settings-manager\n sudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager\n\n\n\n*Hit Alt+F2, type about:config and hit Enter to open the Unity configuration.\n\n\n*Either disable or bind the shortcut for Key to show the launcher  to another key:\n\n\n\n*Now the Super key should open Gnome Do as before.\n\nA: You can also do:\n\n\n*\n\n*System Settings\n\n*Type \"Keyboard Shortcuts\" in the search field.\n\n*Edit the shortcut key you want it be used for gnome-do. Add this shortcut key and bind it to \"gnome-do\" command.\n\n\nCheers :)\n", "Q: How to hide VNC notification? When ever I access a windows machine through VNC from ubuntu the icon changes and notifies the user that someone is logged into the system. Is it possible to hide that notification?\n\n\nA: Nothing to do with Ubuntu, I'm afraid. This is something that the VNC server software is responsible for. The way of setting it also varies from server to server.\nHere's an example of how you might do it with RealVNC:\n\nTo disable the Connection Alert feature, set the \"ConnNotifyTimeout\" setting in the VNC Server \"Expert\" settings tab to \"0\". \n\n", "Q: Set encrypted home passphrase I just reinstalled Ubuntu, Natty. I set to use encrypted home, but once the system was running, I was asked to define the encrypted home passphrase. Out of haste, I skipped that, but now I want to define the passphrase but I couldn't find out how (despite how trivial this sounds).\nI set my /home to a specific partition, so I may reinstall Ubuntu without losing my data whenever I need it, and I guess this is the passphare that I'd need to supply to recover my data on a new install, am I right?\nPlease, how can I define/change my passphrase?\n\nA: You can do that by running this command at terminal:  \necryptfs-unwrap-passphrase ~/.ecryptfs/wrapped-passphrase \n\nThe information you missed when you skiped was:  \n\n", "Q: Why doesn't Document Viewer appear in the dash as an installed application? Document Viewer is part of the 11.04 release, yet it does not appear in the dash anywhere. It is installed, but it cannot be found by a search when in the dash and it does not appear as an installed application. What other preinstalled applications are missing from the dash and why was the dash made so difficult to customize?\n\nA: You need to enable \"evince\" (or any other applications) in menu to search for it in dash. To do so you have to execute \"alacarte\", search the program you want and enable it, then logout. When you came back the application is searchable in dash.\n\nA: I don't know if my answer will be really helpful, but the Document-Viewer (Evince in fact) is also the default program for viewing PDF files on 10.10 and it is not possible to find it in the OS-menu, and a launcher like Synapse also has a hard time finding it (it's deep in the search list). Another program behaving this way is the File Roller (used to compress and decompress files).\nI believe the idea is that those programs are not used actively, but passively. By this i mean that you do not open the file viewer and then chose the file you want to view, create a new file from there. Similarly you do not open the file roller and then choose a file to compress or decompress. On the contrary users will open their files and the file's mimetype will tell what program should be associated with it. A PDF opens Evince and a TAR.GZ opens File Roller.\nSince users don't really need to launch those programs, they are not added to the OS menu or dash in order to save space and gain visibility and access.\nAs to why the dash is so difficult to customize, i have no answer. It may depend on how much you feel you need to customize. If what you really want is customization, perhaps the Unity interface is not what you need. Programs like Synapse and GnomeDo will do the search and Cairo-Dock or Docky can be used as docks.\n", "Q: Do I really need ATI proprietary drivers? Ever since I installed 11.04, I have problems with ATI. If I don't enable it, am I still able to use HDMI with no problems?\n\nA: I couldn't say about HDMI, but my guess would be no.\nHowever, there is a known problem with the ATI Proprietary driver. Actually, not sure what the problem is, but I know of a fix:\n\n\n*\n\n*Performance being really choppy with ATI drivers\n\nA: I am using 11.10 without the proprietary drivers. HDMI works quite well with it. The only things not working are the sound through HDMI-out though and some OpenGL games. If you don't care about this, there's a great chance that you can use the open drivers.\nIf they don't run out of the box, you could try adding ppa:ubuntu-x-swat/x-updates or even ppa:xorg-edgers/ppa (I wouldn't recommend the later for a stable working environment though).\n", "Q: Unable to connect to hidden SSID I just installed Ubuntu 11.04 on my HP mini 110, but unfortunately I'm unable to connect to hidden SSID while it works fine with non hidden wireless. The wireless device is RaLink RT3090. Can anyone help me?\n\nA: I'm using 10.10 and have similar problems. \nRun iwconfig and see if your ESSID is set. If not, run\niwconfig wlan0 essid \"network name\"\n\nwhere you replace \"network name\" by the essid of your network.\nThis works for me.

It works fine up to Ubuntu 10.10 (64bit), but in Ubuntu 11.04 (64 bit), the Vuescan window does not launch under Unity or in Classic mode or in Classic mode - no effects. It does run normally in Safe mode. \nI discovered through trial and error that if I turn OFF the Window Decoration plugin in Compiz (via the CCSM), Vuescan starts normally and opens its GUI window. I can then turn Window Decorations back ON via the CCSM and everything works OK with the window decorations, including Vuescan. \nAs a workaround until either Vuescan is fixed or the Compiz/Unity window decorator is fixed, I would like to start Vuescan with a script, BASH preferably, that would first turn OFF Window Decorations, then start Vuescan (this part is easy and I know how to do it), and then turn Window Decorations back ON. I'm not familiar enough with Compiz and how to communicate with it via Dbus, specifically as it is implemented in Ubuntu 11.04, to be able to do this script on my own. \nAny help much appreciated!\n\nA: OK, there is no longer any need for a script or workaround. As of Nov 3, 2011, version 9.0.61 x64 of Vuescan has fixed the problem between Unity, Compiz, Vuescan and window decorations, at least on Ubuntu 11.10.

Examining the differences between LibreOffice and Open Office and trying to understand what it's all about, would it be correct to assume that LibreOffice will eventually be overtaking Open Office in their advancement as both projects advance from the forking point as a result of simply the variety and number contributing?\n\nA: When Libreoffice was founded, the majority of the full time staff working on OpenOffice moved to work on Libreoffice instead. That means the developers for Libreoffice are essential the same as those who worked on OpenOffice.org (plus a few new coders). Oracle recently announced that they were abandoning OpenOffice.org. \nSo really the answer to your question is that it already has and that users should switch to Libreoffice since they will not see significant additional support for OpenOffice.\n\nA: so fat the only difference i saw between LO and OO is that libreoffice works much worse with equations and formulas from that are created in microsoft office\nsince i study math heavily, it's a  huge letdown for me.\nto be specific libreoffice opens documents with a lot of equations 2-3 (sic!) times slower thatn openoffice and displays them even worse\nalso, libreoffice design (not interface, but apps icons, splash screen on start) are simply ugly. Which is shame because for everyday applications friendly design is just as important as functionality.\n\nA: Although LibreOffice Writer 3.5 saves documents in the Microsoft Office Word 2010 file format (.docx) and OpenOffice Writer 3.4 so far does not, the OO Writer is still the word processor closest to the standard word processors such as Microsoft Office Word. Both OO and LibreOffice resemble Word 2003 in many ways: \n\n\n*\n\n*They save files in the Word 2003/95... format (.doc), which is still widely used today.\n\n*They read all Microsoft Office files.\n\n*They use the \"ribbon-style\" interface.\nHowever, OpenOffice has all of the standard Western fonts, such as Times New Roman, Courier New, Arial, and more. LibreOffice's fonts are similar but NOT THE SAME and do not resemble the standard fonts on Microsoft Office. Believe me! I've tried it. The fonts look great on LibreOffice but not on Microsoft Office 2010.\n", "Q: How do I downgrade my kernel? \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow to downgrade the Kernel on 11.10 \n\nMy wifi used to work very well on ubuntu 10.04 with kernel 2.6.32.28. Now after I installed ubuntu 11.04 with the lastest kernel, my wifi (rt3090) not working anymore. Is it safe to downgrade the kernel?, if so, how to downgrade it?\n\nA: I have done exactly this in the past when upgrading to 11.04 broke my ability to use JACK with my soundcard (although it is no longer a problem with the latest kernel).\nI simply added the previous distribution's APT line to /etc/apt/sources.list (or in a separate file in /etc/apt/sources.list.d), e.g.\ndeb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ maverick-updates main restricted\n\nAfter updating the package list in aptitude, the previous 2.6.32 kernel versions were available in the list. Adding the older repository does not break anything else because apt will not by default downgrade packages, and all of the previous distribution's packages are older or equal to currently-installed versions.\nAlso as Dananjaya says, if you upgraded from an earlier distribution you should still have the older kernels installed anyway. However, you may want to add the APT line as suggested above in order to get security updates for that older kernel.\n\nA: This is one of many solutions to your question,\nDid you upgraded to Ubuntu 11.04 from 10.10? If so kernel images of 10.10 should still be on your system. first run,\nsudo apt-get install startupmanager\nIt will install the 'startupmanager', a useful tool to tweak system settings easily. After you've installed it, run\nsudo startupmanager\nYou will see the main program window and under it's 'boot options' tab, you will see 'Default Operating System' dropdown. Choose your desired kernel image (provided your system have the Image) from that list and close the program. Reboot your Computer.\nTo check wether you booted the kernel you wanted, run this command in your terminal\nuname -a\nHope this helps.\n\nA: Earlier\nDowngrade Kernel: How to downgrade the Kernel on 11.10\nUpgrade kernel: How can I upgrade kernel to 3.1?\n", "Q: How does one remove applications installed through \"python setup.py install\"? I have two applications that I attempted to install, but they didn't work and now I can't get rid of them. They were both installed through sudo python setup.py install so there aren't any actual package files that I can remove from Synaptic/Software center. Niether of the README files say anything about uninstalling and trying sudo python setup.py uninstall (as someone suggested) didn't work. Is there another way to get rid of these applications?\nUsing 11.04, if that helps\n\nA: You should always install Python apps with \"pip\". pip supports uninstall option.\n\nA: Martin v. Löwis answered this here:\n\"You need to remove all files manually, and also undo any other stuff that installation did manually.\nIf you don't know the list of all files, you can reinstall it with the --record option, and take a look at the list this produces.\"\nexamples:\npython setup.py install --record files.txt to generate the list\ncat files.txt | xargs rm -rf to remove the files recorded by the previous step.\n", "Q: Where are the Unity images located, can I access them?

Okay, i'm just a bit nervous. since i updated from maverick to natty, i didn't download any updates. yes, now the third day goes after stable release and so far update-manager hasn't found or downloaded any updates. is that for real?\ni'm wondering because even for 10.10 STILL some updates are coming on a daily basis. And for fresh and not-enough-stable release there are no updates for almost three days? \nTell me that there's nothing wrong with my update-manager and there hasn't been any updates indeed.\n\nA: There are now updates for packages such as firefox.  It may be that you don't have any packages installed that need updates, or perhaps the updates have not propagated to your mirror yet.\nYou can see this by running for instance \n% rmadison firefox\n\n....\nfirefox | 4.0+nobinonly-0ubuntu3 |         natty | source, amd64, i386\nfirefox | 4.0+nobinonly-0ubuntu3 |       oneiric | source, amd64, i386\nfirefox | 4.0.1+build1+nobinonly-0ubuntu0.11.04.1 | natty-security | source, amd64, i386\nfirefox | 4.0.1+build1+nobinonly-0ubuntu0.11.04.1 | natty-updates | source, amd64, i386\n\nHowever, these actually came out even before the final release of Natty, so you probably already have them.\nIf you want to check if your machine is updating ok, what I would do is run sudo apt-get update from a terminal and make sure that it's really reloading its indexes from the right server.\n\nA: There's nothing wrong with your Update Manager - there simply haven't been any updates yet.

Anything else? \n\nA: There are many new packages, so, in normal case I would say it's worth the change, but!\nSince I installed 11.04, I have tons of problems, preventing me from work, so I am moving back to 10.10 in some days. Sure, it has some nice new features (my WiFi connects much faster, general little improvements, and so on), but Natty seems unfinished for me. (Don't forget, the Ubuntu Classic desktop, which is the old Gnome one, is buggy in 11.04.)\n\nA: I'm not necessarily advocating the user of a pre-relase version (although I'm running it), if the features of Unity appeal to you, don't forget 11.10 includes Unity2D which seems pretty awesome at least in my tests in VirtualBox. I would hate to run a version as old as 10.04 (or even 10.10) for daily use on a desktop, but that's just me.\nAre there any specific examples of issues you are having with Classic GNOME in 11.04 I could help you work through?\n\nA: In the final release, Ubuntu 11.10 will have many new updates and changes that will hopefully improve your day to day use and Unity 2D/3D will have gone through a lot of bugfixes so that it will work on your system...

When the CD is copied to your USB drive, the syslinux bootloader has to be installed to it, rather than isolinux from the CD. The different files on the USB drive compared to the CD probably caused the problem when you selected the disk checking option.\nThe main thing to check is that the md5sum of the /casper/filesystem.squashfs file on your USB drive is the same as that file on the ISO. All the other files are just \"helper\" files that allow the USB drive to boot. They aren't used during or after the install.\nTo check that the md5sums are the same, you can run\nsudo mount -o loop /path/to/ubuntu.iso /mnt\nmd5sum /mnt/casper/filesystem.squashfs\nmd5sum /path/to/USB/casper/filesystem.squashfs\n\nand then make sure that the outputs are the same.\n\nA: Disable the reserved storage or make it under 500MB.\n\nA: I landed how to check this. I followed these instructions and my downloaded image seems to pass, but the tool won't work with it. I believe the Startup Disk Creator has a problem, so I am going to use another see if it works.\nHere are the commands:\ngpg --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys \"8439 38DF 228D 22F7 B374 2BC0 D94A A3F0 EFE2 1092\" \"C598 6B4F 1257 FFA8 6632 CBA7 4618 1433 FBB7 5451\"\ngpg --list-keys --with-fingerprint 0xFBB75451 0xEFE21092\ngpg --verify SHA256SUMS.gpg SHA256SUMS\nsha256sum -c SHA256SUMS 2>&1 | grep OK\n\nAnd below the output:\nsha256sum -c SHA256SUMS 2>&1 | grep OK\nubuntu-16.04-desktop-amd64.iso: OK\n\nRemember to put the files in the same directory as the downloaded iso.\n", "Q: How do I set 'nomodeset' after I've already installed Ubuntu? I know that editing the boot options line and adding 'nomodeset' solves the problem of my laptop during LiveCD mode, what I don't know is how to set it at boot up through Grub2 after I've installed Ubuntu.\nSo, my question is; how do I set nomodeset before I boot into Ubuntu?\n\nA: I had the same problem. The above solutions are all correct, but it's a bit more tricky when you have to fix this when running from a Live CD. I found this blog post very helpful.\nThe author basically proposes to mount the installed Linux from within the LiveCD. I did that, and it helped me a lot. So here are the steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Run from the Live CD, and either install Ubuntu or move on if already done\n\n*Check your installed partition with the command \"gparted\". It opens a Window telling you where you installed Ubuntu. In my case it was /dev/sda2 which contained an ext4 partition.\n\n*Mount the partition: sudo mount /dev/sdXY /mnt\n\n*Then mount/bind the directories Grub needs to access: \n\nsudo mount --bind /dev /mnt/dev &&\nsudo mount --bind /dev/pts /mnt/dev/pts &&\nsudo mount --bind /proc /mnt/proc &&\nsudo mount --bind /sys /mnt/sys\n\n*Then move on to this environment using chroot, which I found a supersmart idea: sudo chroot /mnt\n\n*You should now be able to edit /etc/default/grub, as the others pointed out. Like: sudo vi /etc/default/gruband change the line GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"nomodeset\" I found it very useful to also remove quiet and splash so I could see something moving on behind the scenes.\n\n*The author originally noted, he needs that after an installation of Windows,  which broke Grub. He had to reinstall. In my case Grub was intact, but my computer (mac) didn't boot with the original Grub settings. So the only thing left for me was update-grub\nThe author unmounted, but I just rebooted and the new settings where in place. With the \"nomodeset\" option I was able to boot Ubuntu and Lubuntu from a MacBook Pro harddisk.\n\nA: You should add this option to /etc/default/grub, firstly:\nsudo nano /etc/default/grub\n\nand then add nomodeset to GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT:\nGRUB_DEFAULT=0\nGRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT=0\nGRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT_QUIET=true\nGRUB_TIMEOUT=5\nGRUB_DISTRIBUTOR=`lsb_release -i -s 2> /dev/null || echo Debian`\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash nomodeset\"\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=\"\"\n\nAnd then save by hitting Ctrl+O, then exit nano with Ctrl+X, then simply run:\nsudo update-grub\n\n\nA: To edit Grub2 during the boot process try the following:\n\n*\n\n*Immediately after the BIOS splash screen during boot, press and hold the SHIFT button. This will display you grub containing a list of kernels and recovery options\n\n\n\n*Press e to edit the first kernel displayed\n\n\n\n*Find the line ending with quiet splash. Add your boot option before these key words - i.e. so the line looks like [...]nomodeset quiet splash\n\n\n*Press CTRL + X to boot\nFollow the steps in Coldfish's answer on how to fix the nomodeset boot option permanently so that you don't have to go through this manual procedure again.\n", "Q: Is there a desktop-wide privacy mode? With Zeitgeist now tracking everything I really think we need a privacy mode like the one Firefox offers. There is a ridiculous amount of history and caches being stored in Ubuntu from thumbnails to file history. \nAnd god forbid you install a KDE application in gnome, then you get even more file indexers and recently used tracking! Is there a way to clear everything? Even better would be a way to run the OS in a privacy mode that never even wrote to the disk. How can I disable all caching and thumbnailing and history in the OS? Firefox provides private browsing. IE only allows you to delete the cache when you close IE. Firefox wins! Can I get a private session in Ubuntu? \nAlso, my company would like to run Ubuntu off an SD card. Limiting the number of writes to update a cache, history or log would be a really good idea. Switching back and forth would be perfect. Right now Zeitgeist is working on a way to clear history, but come on, can we have an option to not write a history at all? Am I missing something here?\n\nA: I am not sure this is what you are looking for, but it will provide a \"privacy mode\". I am citing webupd8.org:\n\nUntil Zeitgeist Global Privacy is released, install Activity Journal\n  (don't use the version in the official Ubuntu 11.04 Natty Narwhal\n  repositories - that doesn't seem to work), go to its Preferences and on\n  the Plugins tab, enable \"Blacklist Manager\" (seems you have to double\n  click the checkbox to enable it) - now a new \"Blacklist\" tab should be\n  displayed.

Since upgrading to 11.04 I have been trying to get my 5 disk RAID5 array back online.  The array was initially split in two, I tried to use a create command with the assume clean option to get it back into a single array.  I think this did more harm than good because the mdadm default is now to use the 1.2 rather than 0.90 metadata format which I believe caused the metadata to be written over some of my data.  This brought into doubt the disk ordering I thought the array should have as this order will not result in a mountable drive so I used a script to test every possible ordering of the five disks and none of them mounted, I then tried the same process only instead of mounting I ran an xfs_check and then a targetted xfs_repair (with the -n option to prevent any actual edits).\nAll this got me down to a reasonably small collection of disk layouts but I obviously only get one change to try the xfs_repair and the data is far to large to try an backup so I thought having the array run a parity check would be a good idea, I started out with the two array disk orderings I thought most likely to be correct ran check and as it turns out they both had exactly 8 for a mismatch_count and those 8 were discovered almost instantly.  How is this possible? The two disk orderings are very different (acbde vs adcbe)...is it possible disk order will have no effect on a parity check?  Just on the actual underlying data?  If so it might be reasonable to try to run a repair on the array from one of these layouts and then recheck the file-system to see if it can now mount...but I am hesitant to do so as it would be the first step I have taken that intentionally writes more than metadata to the disks.\n\nA: Anyone curious, it turns out my issue was a second default change between array creation and the version of mdadm i ran me new create on, the stripe size default had been 64k and it is now 512k.  Switching to 64k solved my issue.\n\nA: This really sounds like a topic best suited for the md list. Neil\nBrown will know best regarding your metadata update and how\nit might impact the disk scrubber. If it turns out not to be\na problem then you're just a 'repair > sync_action' away from\nrepairing your array.\n", "Q: How do I add and remove the Workspace Switcher launcher from the Unity launcher?

Open a up a terminal and run 'gnome-panel'. Once gnome panel is running, add the 'workspace switcher' applet to the panel. Open up the workspace switcher preferences and select 1 column and 4 rows. Log out and back into unity, and viola! The workspace switcher is missing now.\nYes I know, it's a somewhat annoying way of removing it if you use workspaces, but it's the only way i know of right now..\n\nTo get the Unity launcher switcher back, simply open the gnome-panel in terminal again, and go back to a 2 X 2 grid.

I haven't been able to Google up any info on this: Why doesn't Unity use gnome-panel?\nUnity's panel has no functionality that can't be implemented on top of gnome-panel (witness previous versions of Ubuntu Netbook). The new panel is missing a bunch of features (chiefly system monitors and a decent clock applet), and since gnome-panel applets aren't supported, we'll have to wait for entirely new stuff to be written--in an environment, I understand, that is too crippled to be able to design nice meters and such.\n\nA: The whole idea of Unity is to be a compiz based desktop so there is no need for a gnome-panel. Unity still has to mature. It needs to grow on anyone and it currently lacks a good config tool (at least one for adding lenses to the launcher).\nIt works at the moment so that's good. But it needs a bit more attention.\nSidenote: System monitor and clock can be added as an 'indicator' so that might ease your problem.\nBy the way: your question tends to make this into a discussion. \n\nA: Gnome-panel has first and foremost been abandoned by upstream Gnome. It has been replaced by gnome-shell, and is only meant as a backup for machines that can't run shell. See for instance this mailinglist post.\nHence it would not make sense for a downstream project such as Unity to be based on it.

Does not mean your hard drive has a problem, it is just routine for the system to make sure everything is ok.\nIf you do a man fstab there is a part that talks about the sixth field of the fstab file in /etc/fstab which says:\n   The  sixth field, (fs_passno), is used by the fsck(8) program to deter‐\n   mine the order in which filesystem checks are done at reboot time.  The\n   root  filesystem  should  be specified with a fs_passno of 1, and other\n   filesystems should have a fs_passno of 2.  Filesystems within  a  drive\n   will  be checked sequentially, but filesystems on different drives will\n   be checked at the same time to utilize  parallelism  available  in  the\n   hardware.   If  the sixth field is not present or zero, a value of zero\n   is returned and fsck will assume that the filesystem does not  need  to\n   be checked.\n\nThe fields in fstab are (if you do a nano /etc/fstab ):  \n      Field 1        Field 2     Field 3  Field 4       Field 5   Field 6 \n   <file system> <mount point>   <type>  <options>       <dump>  <pass>\n\n\nA: I solved my problem, which was the same as Silambarasan's:  A few days ago, out of the blue, it started happening that every time I booted up Ubuntu I got \"Your disk drives are being checked for errors, this may take some time\"--which it did, at least 10 minutes.  Very annoying.  Finally I noticed that every time I did a shutdown, just before the machine turned off, the following messages repeated briefly across the screen:  \"could not write\" \"broken pipe\".\nSo that was why it was checking at every bootup: it was having a problem at every shutdown.  I googled broken pipe, and someone advised fixing it by doing \"sudo apt-get -f install\", which would tell me of an error in /var/lib/dpkg/status.  I did that command, but it didn't mention any error.  It said:\n0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 569 not upgraded.\nI hadn't allowed any updates since installing Ubuntu.  All was working fine, so why upset the apple cart?  But now it seemed like that might be the problem, so I did the updates.  I'm on Ubuntu 10.04, so did as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*System > Administration > Update Manager\n\n*Click the Check button to make sure the package info is as up-to-date as possible.\n\n*Click the Install Updates button.\n\n\nAnd voila!  I no longer get \"Your disk drives are being checked...\" when I bring up Ubuntu.

How can I report a bug when ubuntu-bug crashes?\nongun@ongun-ubuntu:~$ ubuntu-bug python\nERROR: /etc/apport/crashdb.conf is damaged: No default database\n\n\nA: When Apport--which ubuntu-bug is part of--doesn't work, it's often best to try to fix the problem with Apport. However, it is possible to report bugs without Apport.\nI don't know if the specific error described here is due to a bug or misconfiguration or some other problem. Users who see that exact message should try the workaround Rinzwind described. Somewhat more generally, though not applicable to the error message shown here, the apport-cli command will sometimes work when ubuntu-bug doesn't.\nBut the answer to \"How can I report a bug when ubuntu-bug crashes?\" (or otherwise cannot be used) is that bugs can be reported directly via Launchpad's web interface, and that such a bug report may be useful so long as the reporter describes the problem carefully and meticulously includes all information reasonably related to it.\nReporting bugs without Apport (when you must)\nThere are two major cases.\n\n\n*\n\n*If you're reporting a non-crash bug by running ubuntu-bug package, then Apport wouldn't attach a stack trace and core dump to the bug report anyway. So it's reasonable to report the bug directly on Launchpad. As its_me's answer to How do I report a bug? says:\n\nIt's as easy as visiting\n  Launchpad\n  and filling the 2 or 3 fields that are there. Command line is not the\n  only way.\nAlternatively, you can use this (replace PACKAGENAME in the URL with\n  the package name. For example: unity, gnome-shell, etc):\nhttp://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/PACKAGENAME/+filebug?no-redirect\n\nIt's mentioned in the Ubuntu\n  documentation.\n\nThat applies directly to the situation described in this question. Just make sure to include enough information to fully describe the bug, the system on which the bug occurs, and the packages relevant to the bug, including their exact versions. As always, users reporting bugs this way should first read ReportingBugs.\n\n*Reporting a bug that causes a crash without Apport is more laborious, but it can be done in the traditional manner. This consists of installing debug symbols for the program that crashed and the libraries it uses, opening the program in a debugger (for Ubuntu packages, gdb should typically be used), then attempting to reproduce the crash. The resulting stack trace, produced by running bt in gdb after the crash, should be usable so long as all the relevant debug symbols were available.\nThis isn't the situation described in the question here, and I don't intend to cover it thoroughly. I mainly mention it so readers who are trying to report crashes don't use the approach mentioned above without also including a stack trace. But basically, some packages have corresponding debug symbols in similarly named packages whose names end in -dbg, and most others have debug symbol packages available from separate repositories that can be enabled and used as described in Debug Symbol Packages.\nUsers considering doing this should definitely read DebuggingProgramCrash as well as ReportingBugs.\nOnce Apport is working again...\nIf you do later get Apport working, you can still use it to add information automatically to the bug report. As v010dya's comment on that answer says:\n\nIf you follow this method, and then decide to add files in the same way as you would by ubuntu-bug method, you can simply type apport-collect REPORTNUMBER, where REPORTNUMBER is the number of the bug, that will be in the URL of your submitted [bug].\n\nThis is most useful for crash bugs where there are stack trace and core dump files in /var/crash to attach.\n\nA: As mentioned in the bug report in comments this seems to be a a \"locale\" issue. \nLC_ALL=C ubuntu-bug python\n\nworks perfectly. \n", "Q: Does Unity have any widgets?

I can't even close it with Ctrl+C, I have to close the terminal I launch it from.\nI guess it means there is something wrong with the USB \"system\" and that's why my IR receiver doesn't work.\nI searched on the web and did not find much about this problem. What should I try to diagnose this?\n\nA: Imho, first try disconnect all what you can from your usb ports, run lsusb, then connect one device, run it again and so on. Plus, more informations about IR receiver, your HW and used kernel may be helpful\nyou can see what kernel you are using now by running \nuname -rvi\n\n"]
