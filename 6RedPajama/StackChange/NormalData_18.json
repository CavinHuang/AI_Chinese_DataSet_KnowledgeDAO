["Q: Word 2011 for Mac: How to delete a Quick Style Set? Tryig to delete a quick style set from Word 2011 for Mac. This link claims the styles are in \"/Users/USERNAME/Library/Application Support/Microsoft/Office/Style Set\" and the save dialog seems to confirm that.\nHowever if I try to go there with the Finder, there is no visible or hidden \"Office\" folder in the \"Microsoft\" folder.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: I'm not a Mac expert, but I think I figured it out. I'm running Office 2011 on Mac OS X 10.9.5. I searched for the name of one of the other quick set styles to figure it out.\nThe quick set folder is located at: /Applications/Microsoft Office 2011/Office/Media/QuickStyles/.\n\nA: On my Mac OS X 10.5.8 system with Word 2008, I do indeed have a folder \"/Users/USERNAME/Library/Application Support/Microsoft/Office/\". I can get to it either with Finder or with the Terminal command-line.\nYou might want to double-check that you are in \"/Users/USERNAME/Library/Application Support/\", and not the system-wide \"/Library/Application Support/\".  There is a \"Microsoft\" directory in both places, but they contain different things.\n", "Q: 6GB of \"other\" on my iPhone 3GS, should I do a clean install of ios? Since I installed iOS 6 there have been many issues with my iPhone 3GS. I now have 6GB of \"unknown\" stuff in the iTunes breakdown, and the phone became much slower, could there be a connection between the two? \nIs it possible to do a clean install of iOS6?\n\nA: You can remove all settings and information from your iPhone using \"Erase All Content and Settings\" in Settings > General > Reset.\nIf that doesn't help you can also try the same from iTunes, see here for details.\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect your iPhone to your computer\n\n*Select it when it appears under Devices\n\n*Select the Summary tab, and click the Restore button\n\n*verify to reset to factory settings and erase all data\n\n\nAfterwards you can restore your data again from a previous backup in iTunes.\n", "Q: Mail.app: How can I set a different default signature for each address? I have my Gmail account setup in Mail 6.2 (Mountain Lion). From that account I can send mail with one of five different addresses (4 other accounts forwarding onto Gmail). Is there a way I can set up a different default signature for each address, rather than a single default signature for all addresses?\nI have 5 addresses and 5 signatures, I just can't link them together.\n\nA: 1) Open Settings (Cmd + ,), click signatures. You will see a list of email accounts on the right.\n\n2) Click the one you want to set a default signature to. Click the + button below the signatures.\n\n3) Add you signature.\nIf you have more than one signature, select your preferred default on from the drop down menu below the signatures.\n\n\nA: You might wanna try SignatureProfiler (shareware). It can assign different signatures and From names for each e-mail address on the same account. Setup is somehow cumbersome (after a conversation with the dev, he acknowledged the plugin needs a redesign) but it works great, pretty much like standard e-mail identities. It also offers other features such as Random Quotes or iTunes/Skype Statuses on e-mail signatures.\nMail alone can't do what you (we) want. Even the option to insert signatures sequentially, when using multiple addresses separated by commas, in the Accounts pane, is as useful as the option to insert signatures randomly.\n", "Q: Is there any keyboard shortcut to turn on and off shuffle and turn on repeating on iTunes? Is there any keyboard shortcut to turn on and off shuffle and turn on repeating on iTunes? They aren't mentioned on iTunes help section Keyboard Shortcut.\n\nA: *\n\n*find repeat and shuffle in iTunes menus and memorize their name as is.\n\n*Press CommandSpace, Type Keyboard and press enter.\n\n*select Keyboard Shortcuts\n\n*in left side of the page, find Application Shortcuts and select it.\n\n*click + button below\n\n*in front of Application, choose iTunes\n\n*type the exact name of the menu item for shuffle and repeat \n\n*set shortcut keys for them.\n\n\nA: iTunes 12 has broken the original Keyboard pane fix. Now Shuffle is a dropdown with two options unhelpfully named On and Off.\nThe following steps work for the current version of iTunes (v12):\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the Keyboard preferences pane in the System Preferences App.\n\n*Go to the Shortcuts tab\n\n*Click on App Shortcuts in the left sidebar\n\n*Click the plus icon below the list on the right\n\n*Select iTunes from the Application dropdown\n\n*Type the word On into the Menu Title box.\n\n*Click on the Keyboard Shortcut box and press the key combination you want to use to turn shuffle on. I use Cmd+S.\n\n*Click Add.\n\n*Repeat steps 4-7 for turning shuffle off, but this time use Off as the Menu Title and choose a different keyboard shortcut for it. I use Cmd+Shift+S for turning shuffle off.\n\n\nA: For nested Menu options like this one shown in the image below:\n\nA shortcut can be added by specifying the Menu Item name as:\nControls->Repeat->One\nFor some older versions of OSX, this works:\n>Controls>Repeat>One\nYou can see it solves the problem of two different nested menu items having the exact same name. Cause the full path will always be different.\n\nA: Here's an answer for fellow Win 7 users: type the sequence Alt+C+S+T to toggle Shuffle. (A little harder to remember than your basic shortcut, but it does the job. You'll just be selecting each menu in turn.)\n", "Q: How does Mountain Lion set the default text editor for the \"open -t\" terminal command? OSX seem to offer open -t command line shortcut to open arbitrary files in the system default text editor.\n\n\n*\n\n*Where is this default text editor set?\n\n*Can I change it from the command line (if possible) or otherwise programmatically?\nThe default choice of TextEdit is limiting.\n\nA: It's the default application for plain text (public.plain-text) files. You can change it from Finder's information panels or with duti.\nYou can also edit ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.launchservices.plist, but it requires restarting to apply the changes.\ndefaults write com.apple.LaunchServices LSHandlers -array-add '{LSHandlerContentType=public.plain-text;LSHandlerRoleAll=com.macromates.textmate;}'\n\nA: You can also use open -a <application> <file> to open a file from the Terminal in the editor of your choice, like so:\nopen -a TextWrangler.app myfile.txt\nTo make this a bit shorter, I also have an alias in my .profile file, like so:\nalias edit=\"open -a TextWrangler.app $1\"\nThis allows me to just type: \nedit myfile.txt \nand the file will open in TextWrangler. \n\nA: According to the open(1) man page:\n-t  Causes the file to be opened with the default text editor, as determined via LaunchServices\n\n\n*\n\n*To change the associated editor, find a file with the extension you are trying to open in the Finder and select it.\n\n*Select File > Get Info from the menu bar.\n\n*Change the \"Open With\" to your text editor of choice.\n\n*Press the \"Change All…\"\n\n\nNow your files with that extension should open in your selected text editor with \"open -t \" from the command line.\n", "Q: How to hide desktop icons on a single desktop I'm a big fan of multiple desktop spaces on OS X 10.7 (see image). \n\nI'm wondering if you can hide desktop icons on just one of the 4 spaces I have setup. Is that possible? \n\nA: This free app may be useful to you. It does not exactly do what you ask, but it comes close, and there may be ways to further automate it to get even closer.\nhttp://www.shirt-ediss.me/clarity/\nWhen this is installed as directed, a couple of simple terminal commands, e.g.:\n$ sw 0\n$ sw 1\n\nlet you empty the desktop of icons (except for mounted drives, if you have your desktop configured to show them) and then switch back to your standard desktop.\nIn my initial testing (I just installed it tonight) it takes about 2 seconds to clear the desktop and about 4 seconds to restore it.\nClarity has the added advantage of letting you save various desktop configurations to switch back and forth among, identified by either number or a text name. In the above commands, you could also type\n$ sw home\n\nwhich may be more mnemonic if you have saved dozens of desktop configurations.\nIf you want to have the Clarity commands automatically invoked to change the icons when you move between desktop workspaces, as in the OP, I believe you can achieve that using the free Mac program CurrentKey Stats (https://currentkey.com/). The latest version (12/2020) adds the feature of \"Bi-directional AppleScript support\". As described on the CurrentKey web page:\n\nCurrentKey can also notify your own custom AppleScript every time you switch between Rooms. This enables you to trigger Room-specific functionality outside of the app.\n\nWhile I have not tested that feature of CurrentKey, I've corresponeded with the developer and I use it for switching between workspace desktops constantly.\nIt seems like it would be a straighforward task to have CurrentKey trigger an AppleScript function that runs sw 0 when you enter a specific workspace and then run sw 1 when you leave it. If I were more facile with AppleScript, I would knock one up right now to try it and complete this answer.\nAnother technique for clearing and restoring the desktop icons is described at Hide files/icons on the desktop but not in finder. While Clarity (above) empties the Desktop folder and then restores it from saved snapshots, the technique on that thread addresses the need to have the contents of the Desktop folder stay intact. It turns off or on a Finder default setting and then kills the Finder app so that it restarts.\nWhen I tried it, the icons went away instantly, but so did my Finder windows, which then took about 12 seconds to be automatically restarted. When restoring the desktop, the Finder windows were again restored in about 12 seconds with the desktop icons following a few seconds later. Personally, I would find it disturbing to have that automatically happen whenever I changed desktop workspaces. If you absolutely need to access the contents of your Desktop directory while the icons are hidden, that delay may be worth it to you.\nI hope this helps.\n", "Q: Are there any iPad accessories that vibrate, for silent alarms? Are there any iPad accessories that vibrate, to permit the same kind of silent notification iPhones can?\n\nA: Unfortunately not.\nThe OS would have to have support for said accessories, and anyway, there are no accessories for vibration.\nYou can submit feedback to Apple on the iPad here, but they won't respond and it might take them some time to implement the feature (if they ever do).\n", "Q: Finder does not show content of some folders I'm running Lion on Macbook2,1 and after I've upgraded from Leopard, I've noticed that some folders including Pictures are shown empty in Finder. Size of folder says otherwise and in Terminal I can see all my files and folders.\nAny Idea what's going on?\n\nTerminal:\nIffat:Pictures mac$ cd Photo\\ Booth\\ Archive/\nIffat:Photo Booth Archive mac$ ls -l\ntotal 0\ndrwxr-xr-x   94 mac  staff  3196 Nov 22 15:26 Archive up to 91.08.13\ndrwxr-xr-x    3 mac  staff   102 Nov 22 15:26 Family\ndrwxr-xr-x   31 mac  staff  1054 Nov  2  2011 First Soheil Setup\ndrwxr-xr-x   11 mac  staff   374 Nov  2  2011 Mita\ndrwxr-xr-x    3 mac  staff   102 Nov 22 15:26 Tidy\n\nIn Finder's Get Info, there isn't much to tell, everything is normal, except for Kind: Folder which is missing.\nSize: 338683879 bytes (339.3 MB on disk) for 278 items\n\n\nA: Can't say I've ever seen that sort of behaviour before, I'm not really sure what might have caused it, but I've got two things to test.\nFirst off, it's possible that the folders got hidden for some reason. Try running\nchflags -R nohidden ~/Pictures/Photo\\ Booth\\ Archive/*\n\nIf that doesn't work, see if you can access the folders directly in the Finder by focusing the Finder, pressing ⌘ cmd + ⇧ shift + G and entering the full path of one of the folders into the \"Go to the folder:\" dialog. If Finder can get there, then there's likely some setting hiding them from view; if not, then there's some reason Finder can't properly access the actual directories on disk.\n\nA: I did chflags -R nohidden name_of my directory and it did not work. Then \nI clicked on the apple icon on the top left left, went to \"Force to quit\", selected\nFinder, confirm clicking on the \"relaunch\" icon and it works. \n\nA: I have the same problem - in finder folders that had files in them earlier show as empty later on. I find that a reboot always corrects the finder views, until something causes them to disappear again several hours or even days later.\nIf I force quit finder and relaunch then finder never relaunches so the reboot is the only option.\n", "Q: How can I add fonts to GIMP 2.8.2 on OS X? Starting with GIMP 2.8, the application is no longer visibly dependent on X11, so suddenly all the advice I'm aware of for adding fonts to GIMP don't seem to work.\n(This worked with GIMP 2.6)\nNow what's a reasonable way to get GIMP to accept new fonts?  Preferably I'd like it to use all the same fonts I've got installed in the system Font Book.\n\nA: You can add fonts from the preference menu item: \nGimp-2.8 -> Preferences -> Folders ->Fonts. \nNow simply add the folder containing your fonts.\n/Library/Fonts/ for systemwide fonts \n~/Library/Fonts/ for user installed fonts\n\nA: This doesn't meet my desired set up of working with Font Book, but it does work:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a directory ~/.fonts/\n\n*Copy fonts into that folder.\n\n*Press the refresh button at the bottom of the font picker.\n\n\nNote, I found the idea for ~/.fonts/ by nosing around in /Applications/GIMP.app/Contents/Resources/etc/fonts/fonts.conf\n", "Q: How to remove synced iPhone data in iTunes 11? I didn't have a free outlet to plug my iPhone charger into, so I plugged it into the USB port of my work computer (Macbook Pro) to charge.  Anyway, iTunes 11 and iPhoto opened up!  I forgot that iPhones automatically sync with iTunes (as I never sync with anything -- I don't back anything up -- my contacts and calendar are synced to Google, and that's all I really care about on my phone).  I was able to disable iPhoto from opening, but I can't do that with iTunes.  I did click on the Preference to \"Prevent iPods, iPhones, and iPads from syncing automatically\" but this was after I think some syncing took place.  How can remove whatever data was synced?  I think it was just the apps that got synced, but how can I be sure?  Is there some folder hidden somewhere in the system that I can check?  And if it is only the apps, how do I remove that information?\nThis is my work computer, and I don't want any information from my personal phone to end up on it.\nI learned my lesson -- don't plug anything personal into a work computer.\n\nA: There isn't an easy way to have iTunes show you the last sync data.\nYou could use Time Machine to compare the files in ~/Music/iTunes after the sync with before it. (Or just restore that entire folder or the entire Mac from a backup before the sync.)\nThe automatic sync that happens with a new computer is not any actual transfer of files as you would have to go into iTunes and set up the rules or accept the automatic sync of content so unless you already had synced that device to that iTunes library before no data would transfer.\n", "Q: Mac OS X 10.7 Window Shadow Params I would like to create some Mac OS X 10.7 Windows \"simulations\" in Photoshop. \nI would like to learn about the window's shadow parameters, like size, spread and distance.\nCould anybody help me with this???\n\nA: For Mac OS X standard windows use drop shadow with folowing parameters: black #000000 color with opacity 60%, angle 90º, distance 25px, size 50px, spread 0px.\n\nA: Actually it's more of a combination of two drop shadows.

Is this a bug with my setup, or for everyone?\n\nA: I am unable to replicate this behaviour – when I click \"Reply\" in the native OS X Mail app, having All Inboxes selected, the address and correct alias name pops up. (If I only have the iCloud-inbox selected, it automatically replies from the main iCloud address..)\nOne thing you should do is double check the alias' settings on iCloud.com – specifically the alias name. If it's filled correctly, try to remove the iCloud (mail)account from your mac and relink it. If that doesn't fix it, go all the way and remove the actual alias from iCloud and make a new one, and try again. If even that doesn't fix it, throw your mac on the ground and walk away angrily. (No, don't actually try that, it won't work)\nIf nothing works, and you are unable to replicate this behaviour on a different computer, delete all settings and completely reset the Mail app.\n", "Q: iPad iOS6 built-in Notes app - where are the notes stored? I was thinking about migrating a majority of my text-based notes from Evernote to the built-in Notes app.  Evernote wants 4.99 a month to store off-line notebooks on your mobil e device.  I currently use a Macbook Air but was thinking about consolidating my notes onto my iPad so I'm not referencing two devices.  \nBut I don't want old notes that were sync'd to the application to disappear or somehow be lost to me.\nAre the notes stored locally? Is there a limit? \n\nA: Notes are stored locally without limit other than storage space on the iOS device. They sync to iCloud and there is a web app for viewing / editing the notes. \nThey do count towards your 5 GB of free iCloud storage that you get by virtue of operating an iOS device. Should you need more storage than that, you can pay yearly.\nIf you don't sync the notes to the cloud, then that limit is not in effect. Whether or not you sync with iCloud, the notes are stored locally on the iPad.\n", "Q: \"New Folder with Selection\" question I'm looking for a way to change the minimum number of files required to 1 so I can make a folder from a single selected file rather than having to have 2 selected before it becomes available.\nTo see what I mean...\nGo to Finder\nSelect any two (or more) files in the same folder or the Desktop.\nright click on the selection\nyou will see a choice \"New Folder with Selection (x items)\"\nI would like to be able to only select one and have that choice appear.\nThanks.\n\nA: I would suggest creating a new Service in Automator.

Is it necessary to buy an iPad case from Apple, or are other companies just as suitable? FOr example, I recently discovered a company called Domeo Products. I found their website, domeoproducts.com, and it looks like they have some great cases. However, I am unfamiliar with them and do not know how they compare to companies like Apple. \n\nA: All depends on your needs. I personally don't like the cases from Apple. I think there are better 3rd party cases. OtterBox is a good option. I have one for my iPad and I really like it. It's rugged and versitile. When shopping for something like this, I like to research. I go to places like Amazon and read the reviews. Just remember, You have to take some of the reviews with a grain of salt. However, it's a good place to get options.\n", "Q: Has Mountain Lion broken the ability to show Desktop with a gesture, begin dragging an icon, and unshow the Desktop? I have just upgraded from Snow Leopard to Mountain Lion. Despite my initial concerns relating to the new gestures, I am actually getting on pretty well and many of the new features are welcome.\nI do however have one real gripe. Back in Snow Leopard I used to use a nifty trick with the touchpad show desktop gesture...\nSay for example I had a window open and wanted to drag an item onto it from the desktop, but that item was obscured by the window. What you would normally have to do of course would be to move or resize the window out of the way and then drag and drop the icon, and then put the window back where you had it. Highly tedious.\nWhat I had worked out was that if you used the four-finger swipe up to show the desktop, you could then click down on an icon and if you didn't begin to move it, you could then perform a four-finger swipe down to restore the window to its original place, and then with one finger still held down I would drag the icon onto the window where I wanted it.\nIt sound pretty complex when you describe it, but it's actually really intuitive and I used that pretty much all of the time. In fact it is only since I have upgraded that I realise how much I depend on that little trick in my day-to-day use.\nThe problem is that this does not appear to work anymore in mountain lion, using the pinch outward gesture to display the desktop - fine. But if you try and grab an icon it is impossible to restore your windows with the gesture, only allowing you to move the icon.\nIs there anybody out there who has this same experience. Can the trick I know and use so much be replicated on Mountain Lion? If not suppose I will be going back to Snow Leopard, because this is a deal-breaker for me!\n\nA: Another way to do this is to map \"show desktop\" to a hot corner (System Preferences > Mission Control > Hot Corners).\n\n\n*\n\n*Show the desktop using the four-finger gesture or by using the hot\ncorner\n\n*Drag the file from the desktop to the hot corner, which will restore\nthe windows AND keep the file in hand\n\n*Drop the file onto whichever window you like.\n\n\nThis is how I do it, and it doesn't require any finger acrobatics.\n\nA: That is quite a trick. Here is a workaround:\n\n\n*\n\n*Pinch four fingers and thumb out to show desktop.\n\n*Click the file with your thumb\n\n*Use the four fingers down gesture. This is the equivalent to pinch together, when coming back from desktop view, only you don't move your thumb.\n\n*Swipe up with four fingers. The window state before you used the show desktop gesture will be resumed, and you will have the file in hand.\n\n\nUnfortunately, it does take that extra step, however, as much as you use that, hopefully it won't take you long to adjust. You will want to make sure whatever window you are dropping it into is on top before you start the \"trick\".\n\nA: This is still so annoying but I just  discovered the the perfect way to do this. It reminiscent me of the good old days of the 4 finger up-swipe.\nIt may sound awkward at first but it feels almost as nice as the old way when you get used to it. \n\n\n*\n\n*Position your index and middle fingers on each hand to form a loose V in the center of the trackpad\n\n*Slide your fingers on your left hand toward the bottom left  corner as you slide the fingers on your right hand toward the top right  corner.\n\n\nA: Simply assign 'fn' in Mission Control to 'show desktop' and you are all set.\n", "Q: Disable Trash on a specific drive Is there a possibility of disabling the trash-bin for a drive and deleting files instantly?\nI'm using DVD-RAM as a backup solution and trashing files is producing a lot of additional, unnecessary writes on the backup discs as the files are moved to a new location and then overwritten on delete from the trash bin.\n\nA: Just found a solution for this on the web while waiting for the timelimit on creating questions:\nYou just need to open terminal, go to the drive you want the trash-bin to be disabled on and then do this:\nsudo rm -rf .Trashes\ntouch .Trashes\n\nEssentially what this does is deleting the trash-bin recursively and replacing it with an empty file thus blocking OSX from recreating it. When you delete files after that OSX will ask you about instant deletion instead of putting it into the trash-bin. Works perectly.\n", "Q: \"The iTunes library file cannot be saved. A folder was specified instead of a file.\" ...what? I just updated to iTunes 11.\nNow I get this error:\n\nHuh? Some Googling turns up people with this problem in iTunes 7 & 8. That was a while ago.

Yikes:\n\nMost of those temp files appeared on 11/18/12, so this must have been happening before today when I upgraded.\nSo, is there a good solution? Why might this happen? Is re-building the library the only way? I'd rather not lose my date-added and play-count data.\n\nA: This is a possible solution that I came across and (initially) it seems to have worked for me:\nQuoted from Apple Support Communities:\n\nI assume the problem is gone now and here's what I did to get rid of it:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*stop iTunes\n  \n*alt-start iTunes, so it offers 'Create Library' and 'Choose Library'\n  \n*choose 'Create Library' to create a new library (iTunes 1)\n  \n*stop iTunes\n  \n*alt-start iTunes, so it offers 'Create Library' and 'Choose Library'\n  \n*choose 'Choose Library' and chose my main library, which caused me so much pain \n  \n  \n  since then no more tmp files are left over in the iTunes folder and I hope it stays like this\n\n", "Q: How can I make my microSD card writable? I have a macbook pro running Snow Leopard.  I have Tuxera NTFS drivers.  \nI have a microSD card, in an adapter, in the slot.  The \"lock\" slider is in the \"unlocked\" position.\n'Get Info' tells me the drive is formatted to FAT16.  The permissions panel tells me that I can only read.\nDisk utility tells me it's not writable.  (It does this for the volume and also for the higher level Apple SD Card Reader Media)\nWhat do I need to do to change permissions to turn this card writable?\n\nA: I've encountered the same. Ended up doing this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Backup the SD Contents\n\n*Format the SD as FAT16 using Disk Utility and Terminal\n\n\nfollowing these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Unmount (not eject) the SD from Disk Utility and copy the id (doing CMD+I on the SD and then selecting the Disk Identifier value (e.g. disk2s1))\n\n*Format to FAT16: sudo newfs_msdos -F 16 /DEV_PATH/TO_SDK so in my case: sudo newfs_msdos -F 16 /dev/disk2s1\nHTH\n\nA: I had a PNY 32gb SD Card. Spent hours trying to find out how to make it re-writeable. Well the answer is simple. The slider on the left side of the card must be \"up\" (the read-writable position) BUT ALSO the tiny \"notch\" opposite the slider must be covered with a piece of tape. It's really the opposite of the old video tapes, which we had to break the tab if we did not want anything recorded over it. But I can guarantee you I've bought a lot of SD cards and have NEVER had a card that was write-protected out of the package that required me to do anything but raise the slider on the left side.\n\nA: Micro SD to SD adapters are even more unreliable than the card itself.  I have noticed random behaviour (also on Macbook pro) just by reinserting the card without touching the lock and also after touching the lock.\nI could not reproduce bmike's trick.  He might have be fooled by such random behaviour.  Please confirm. \nI recommmend to use Micro SD to USB adapter: there is no switch and the contacts are better.  Some cost like 1 € and are as big as a nail. \n\nA: I had no clue why my sd card somehow got turned onto unwritable. I filled it up to 8/ 16 gigs n decided, OK I really need to fix this card now!\nI finally recalled some cards can lock data. After a few flips n tests with the switch slides. I'm not finnaly able to delete again.\nSo simple.\nBuilt in lock mechanism on the actual card!\nI tried reformating, no availablity, moving from card to desktop, changing options in each folder. But it was there the whole time.\n\nA: Switch the lock mechanism on the physical SD card. \n\nA: Had the same problem, I unmounted it using terminal, following this tutorial\nhttps://superuser.com/questions/527657/how-do-you-format-a-2gb-sd-card-to-fat32-preferably-with-disk-utility\n", "Q: Disable Command-M to minimize window On my keyboard layout, the M key is right next to the W key:\n\nThis can be problematic at times because occasionally I will accidentally press Command-M instead of Command-W, causing the window to be minimized rather than closed.\nSince there's no keyboard shortcut to un-minimize a window (well ok, no easy keyboard shortcut), this is even more annoying because then I have to switch to my trackpad to un-minimize the window and then try again to close it.\nIs there a way to disable the Command-M shortcut for minimizing a window?\n\nA: You can \"override\" the default Command-M shortcut by mapping it to something else. To remap the key combination, launch System Preferences and choose Keyboard. Then the Keyboard Preferences Panel appears, click on the right tab named \"Keyboard Shortcuts\". You will notice many default keyboard shortcuts that you can override.\nI've tried remapping Command-M using this method and it works.\n\nA: You can disable it by editing ~/Library/Preferences/.GlobalPreferences.plist:\ndefaults write -g NSUserKeyEquivalents -dict-add 'Minimize' '\\0'\n\nTo apply the changes you have to reopen applications. If the shortcut was assigned to nil, pressing L would trigger it in Audacity.\n\nA: Remapping Command-M to Zoom in \"All Applications\" seemed to be a good workaround as Zoom appears in all applications and doesn't have nearly as disruptive an effect as an unintentional Minimize.\nI was going to try the terminal command above so I went to remove the command M for Zoom and lo and behold, Minimize was now listed with no key command. So I just left it that way, now command-M does nothing and minimize lives harmlessly in the Menu. No terminal command necessary.\n\nA: You can remap any key and key combination with the wonderful and free software Karabiner. After installing, just add the following code to your ~/Library/Application Support/Karabiner/private.xml:\n  <item>\n    <name>Map Cmd-M to Cmd-Alt-M</name>\n    <appendix>Changes the minimize shortcut</appendix>\n    <not>EMACS</not>\n    <identifier>private.kill_m</identifier>\n    <autogen>__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::M, ModifierFlag::COMMAND_L|ModifierFlag::OPTION_L, KeyCode::M, ModifierFlag::COMMAND_L</autogen>\n    <autogen>__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::M, ModifierFlag::COMMAND_L, KeyCode::VK_NONE</autogen>\n  </item>\n\n  <item>\n    <name>Map Cmd-Q to Cmd-Alt-Q</name>\n    <appendix>Changes the quit shortcut</appendix>\n    <not>EMACS</not>\n    <identifier>private.kill_q</identifier>\n    <autogen>__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::Q, ModifierFlag::COMMAND_L|ModifierFlag::OPTION_L, KeyCode::Q, ModifierFlag::COMMAND_L</autogen>\n    <autogen>__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::Q, ModifierFlag::COMMAND_L, KeyCode::VK_NONE</autogen>\n  </item>\n\nThen klick \"Reload XML\" in the Karabiner preferences and set checkmarks for the new items.\nThis way the minimizing shortcut is not entirely disabled but still available with the additional option key: Cmd+Option+M or by simply using the right command key: Cmd (right)+M.\nNote that the second part also changes the Cmd+Q shortcut to Cmd+Option+Q for your convenience. You can omit the second item, if you don’t need it.\n\nA: You can \"reset\" the shortcut assigned to Minimize by adding a new shortcut in System Preferences>Keyboard>Shortcuts>App Shortcuts. Just press the plus button, specify the name of the menu title (in this case \"Minimize\"), press a new shortcut and confirm with \"Add\".\nNote that the name of the menu title must be an exact match. If other users on your Mac use a different language, or some of your apps are in another language, you will need to create shortcuts for all of those languages.\nFor example, if both Korean and English are used on your Mac, you will need to create two entries, one for each language:\n\n\nA: There's a handy keyboard layout called \"Dvorak - Qwerty⌘\". It's basically Dvorak, but it flips the layout to QWERTY while the ⌘ key is held down. It was designed so that people who want to learn Dvorak don't have to retrain their hotkey muscle memory, but it could help you too.\n", "Q: Automator: Using Cmd F in a \"watch me do\" and trying to make decisions based on the results Using automator, I have navigated to a website that required a password, pulled up a page and need to search that page for a word.  Let's say the word is \"flowmaster\" for example.  I had Automator do a 'watch me do' and typed Cmd-F to search that page.  I type in flowmaster and it returns in the spotlight command line 0 matches.  \nLet's say I want it to keep re-searching the page and when the word 'flowmaster' comes up as a match, have it send an email to me to alert me that it is on the page.  When I have Automator 'get text from  webpage' or 'get contents of webpages' it just returns the title of the page or the opening page of the website.  \nTo show you what I am trying to do, type \"command F\" now, then type in \"flowmaster\"  it should say to the left of the spotlight search 4 matches and the left/right arrow keys.  That is the data I am looking for.  Is there a way to have that 1 match information trigger an event?  Like, if there is 1 match, send email saying \"one available\".  The problem with the 'watch me do' is that there is nothing there for most of the time, but when the word pops up on the website, I need it to alert me.  \nIs this possible?\n\nA: Automator's \"Watch Me Do\" functionality is pretty limited, as you've discovered. Additionally, imitating how a user might go about something isn't always the best way to automate things — for example, the computer doesn't need to open up a browser window and use the find panel to search the text of a webpage, it can just download the data and search it without need for any of the GUI niceties.\nAutomator Email Notifications for Matching Text on a Site\n\n\n*\n\n*Add a Get Specified URLs action. Add to it the address of the page you want to check.\n\n*Add a Get Text from Webpage action and make sure the dropdown is set to plain text.\n\n*Add a Run Shell Script action, with the shell set to /bin/bash and the input setting to to stdin. Enter the following text, replacing search term with the text you want to match (be sure to keep the quotes if the string has spaces):\ngrep -o \"search term\" | wc -l | tr -d \" \"\n\nNote that the search is case sensitive.\n\n*Add a Run AppleScript action, and insert the following text, replacing me@example.com as appropriate:\non run {input, parameters}\n    if input > 0 then\n        tell application \"Mail\"\n            set theNewMessage to make new outgoing message with properties {subject:\"Found Matches\", content:\"Found \" & input & \" matches\", visible:false}\n            tell theNewMessage\n                make new to recipient at end of to recipients with properties {address:\"me@example.com\"}\n                send\n            end tell\n        end tell\n    end if\nend run\n\nYou can replace the subject and content, but be sure to properly format them as AppleScript strings (I'll leave this as an exercise to the reader, it's fairly easy to figure out, Google if necessary).\nThat will send an email if there are any matches for the string on the site. The AppleScript is used instead of Automator's email actions because Automator doesn't offer any conditional (i.e. if statements) means of performing actions, and we only want to send an email if a match was found. Let me know in the comments if you have any questions.\n", "Q: How can I launch a Virtualbox VM from the Dock? How can I put my VirtualBox on my Dock in Mac OS X Lion.  I want to have it on my dock so I can click on it to launch it.\n\nA: Right click VM in Manager, create desktop icon.  Select the desktop icon and press Control+Shift+Command+T\nThat's it done\n\nA: I don't use Virtualbox, but based on a couple resources, it looks like you can launch a specific VM from the command line, which means we can create a basic Automator application to serve as a launcher, which you can then put in the Dock.\nIn Automator, create a new workflow. Add a Run Shell Script action, and enter /abolute/path/to/vboxmanage startvm \"vmname\" in the text box. Replace vmname with the name of your VM as it appears in the Virtualbox GUI (make sure to keep the quotes though). Save the workflow, setting the File Format to Application. Then drag the resulting app onto your Dock.\n", "Q: Transferring PC files to MacBook Pro with Lion OS via flash drive I have a flash drive with all the files from my old PC.  How do I access / find this flash drive after it is installed, and can I save and use these files (Microsoft Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook primarily)?  \n\nA: Accessing Flash Drive\n\n\n*\n\n*Plug the flash drive into your Mac.\n\n*Open a Finder window. (Double click any folder on your desktop, or click the blue face in the Dock.)\n\n*Move your mouse over the sidebar on the left-hand side of the Finder window, then place two fingers on the trackpad, and scroll down until you see your flash drive.\n\n*Click on your flash drive.\n\n*Open a new Finder window by pressing Command-N.\n\n*Find the files you want to copy from your flash drive, and drag them to where you want them copied in the second window.\n\n\nUsing Files\nYou have a number of options here:\n\n\n*\n\n*You can get Microsoft Office for Mac, which will enable you to open, edit and save Word, Excel and PowerPoint documents. \n\n*If you prefer something cheaper, there is free open source project called Libre Office, which will let you open, edit and save Word, Excel and PowerPoint documents. Unfortunately there are a few features of Word and PowerPoint that it can't handle, but for most basic documents it should suffice. \n\n*If you want a solution that is free, and 100% compatible, you can try Microsoft's new SkyDrive service. It gives you free access to an online version of Office, and you can export Documents to PDF if you want to print them.\n\n*If you just want to quickly preview documents, and don't mind the formatting being a bit dodgy, you can use QuickLook, by single-clicking on the file in Finder, then pressing Spacebar You can also double-click them, and open them in Preview.\n\nA: I'm going to assume you are talking about finding it in Terminal and not Finder as you asked about access /. \nTry\n    cd /Volumes/nameOfFlashDrive\n\nThat will put you in the / directory of the flash drive. If you don't know the name of the flash drive.\n    cd /Volumes\n\nThen do a ls. Your flash drive should be listed. You could also find the name of the flash drive listed in Finder.\n", "Q: How do I fix 'servermgr_certs' error when clicking on ProfileManager in OSX Server Server.app?

So does HTTPS for your web server, and SMTPS on your mail server, FYI. So if there is something wrong with your certificate chain, including any kind of validation error, a servermgr_certs error might occur. Do you have any self-signed certificates that you created through Keychain Access, for example, that have null fields?\n\nA: It turns out the problem was with the '< hostname > Code Signing Certificate'. I wasn't able to determine what the exact issue with it was, but the fix was to delete that certificate in Keychain Access and re-setup Profile Manager, including ticking the 'Sign configuration profiles' checkbox. This regenerated the code signing certificate, which my server is how happy with.\n", "Q: How do I delete podcasts in iTunes without deleting them from my iPod? I'm running into a sync behavior that I need to find a way around.

I wait until I've listened to the podcast, then resync to the computer, podcast becomes marked as \"listened\" then I know I can delete.\n\nA: This can be done if you disable auto sync in device settings, and automatic sync manager.\nFor that however you need to sync the new ones by selecting and dragging to ip*d to sync. That way the ones that got deleted won't be deleted from the device but only from the computer.\n", "Q: Bluetooth 4, how do we take advantage of its low energy features?

It's as if I'm switching between different modes.\nWhat is going on in the background?  Is this to run some compatibility script?  Why does the system need to prompt for this?\n\nA: Some preference panes are 32-bit binaries and some are 64-bits. When System Preferences is in 64-bit mode, to launch a 32-bit preference pane, the app needs to re-launch.\nMore information is available from Apple or from MacWorld.\n", "Q: iPhoto export shrinks images (and shows inconsistent file properties) I have several images at 5184 × 3456 (confirmed by the info panel in iPhoto), but when I Right-Click + Show File, it opens a version in finder that is only 1296 × 864. The path it's taking me to in Finder is obviously not the original.\nIn iPhoto, I can also zoom in to the actual size, but when exporting, it only exports that smaller size. This is even with the \"Original\" and \"Full Size\" options selected in the Export.\nHow can I simply get the full size image out?\n\nA: \"The path it's taking me to in Finder is obviously not the original.\" It is taking you to a location that looks like this? \nAlso, Depending on how your exporting may change the characteristics of the file format, hence changing from the \"Original\" and the original location. \nIt should also be noted that PhotoStream can change the size of files. For example, if you take a photo with you iPhone and sync via cable to you Mac, but then alter the photo in an iPad using iPhoto, what you get is a different sized file.

All I have is an ssh access.\nSince a DMG is a disk image, I tried to mount it, but mount does not seem to recognize its format. \nfile says my dmg file is a VAX COFF executable. \n\nA: You should be able to mount the .dmg using:\nhdiutil attach /path/to/file.dmg\n\nAnd then copy its contents (which appears in /Volumes) where ever you like.\n\nA: I had to mount and copy the .app to /Applications folder.\nFor Etcher.app:\nFirst as @trojanfoe said :\nsudo hdiutil attach /Users/janatac/Etcher-1.2.1.dmg\n\nThen\nsudo cp -R /Volumes/Etcher\\ 1.2.1/Etcher.app /Applications\n\nYou then have your application in /Applications folder\nDon't forget to unmount the volume :\nsudo hdiutil unmount /Volumes/Etcher\\ 1.2.1/\n\nGot it working after reading instructions from a blog post.\n\nA: If you want to script the install it requires a few more steps since the name of the .dmg file, the name of the Volume created, the name of the application, and the name of the device that needs to be detached can all be different. Plus they can have spaces in them.\nAlso a .dmg can have an .app file or a .pkg file in it and these require different behavior.\nHere's a bash function to install a dmg from a remote URL:\n# usage: installdmg https://example.com/path/to/pkg.dmg\nfunction installdmg {\n    set -x\n    tempd=$(mktemp -d)\n    curl $1 > $tempd/pkg.dmg\n    listing=$(sudo hdiutil attach $tempd/pkg.dmg | grep Volumes)\n    volume=$(echo \"$listing\" | cut -f 3)\n    if [ -e \"$volume\"/*.app ]; then\n      sudo cp -rf \"$volume\"/*.app /Applications\n    elif [ -e \"$volume\"/*.pkg ]; then\n      package=$(ls -1 \"$volume\" | grep .pkg | head -1)\n      sudo installer -pkg \"$volume\"/\"$package\" -target /\n    fi\n    sudo hdiutil detach \"$(echo \"$listing\" | cut -f 1)\"\n    rm -rf $tempd\n    set +x\n}\n\nNote if your .dmg has an .app file that runs to install the program, then you will need to do something different again.\n\nA: First, mount the dmg image : sudo hdiutil attach <image>.dmg\nThe image will be mounted to /Volumes/<image>. Mine contained a package which i installed with: sudo installer -package /Volumes/<image>/<image>.pkg -target /\nFinally unmount the image: sudo hdiutil detach /Volumes/<image>.\n\nA: You could try the command open disk://host.tld/image.dmg.\n\nA: After you've downloaded the.dmg file. By pressing the right button, the file must be mounted and opened with the same picture.DiskImageMounter(Default).\n .\nThe. app file will then be shown. When the. app file appears, open the terminal and navigate to the write directory where the file is located. and type open -a/ExistingFileName.app in the command prompt, then press enter.

For that I need cross platform application just like wine in Ubuntu.\nCan anyone suggest me the application?\n\nA: There is a wine port for OS X: http://wiki.winehq.org/MacOSX\nFrom the project page:\n\nCurrent Status (x86)\nWine works well on OSX for Intel based Macs minus a proper\ndistribution package (Mac Application Bundle) to fully integrate with\n\"drag and drop\" and \"open\" or \"open with\" functionality. Wine also has\nshortcomings with desktop icon integration and execution of certain\ntypes of DOS or blended Windows/DOS programs.\n\n(Notice that Darwine, the original effort to port Wine to OS X, was primarily written for PowerPC Macs. Some work was done to support Intel Macs, but it is no longer actively developed, so you are better off avoiding it.)\nThere are no official Wine packages available for Intel Macs as of this writing, so you'll have to use a third-party application like WineBottler (http://winebottler.kronenberg.org/), PlayOnMac (http://www.playonmac.com/en/download.html, for Snow Leopard and Lion). or Wineskin (http://wineskin.urgesoftware.com/tiki-index.php, for Lion and Mountain Lion).\ndaviewales has mentioned in a comment below a package manager I didn't know of called Homebrew (<Link>). You may want to give it a try.\nOtherwise you can try the commercial product CrossOver, which is basically Wine with, as Wikipedia puts it, various compatibility patches added, more user-friendly configuration tools, and commercial support.\nYou can download a free trial here: http://www.codeweavers.com/products/\n\nA: In addition to the other answer, take a look at WineBottler: http://winebottler.kronenberg.org\nThis application deals with some of the technical side of using wine on OS X, like creating application profiles etc. It essentially allows you to encapsulate the .exe as a mac application, and run it natively in OS X without the need for running a virtual machine.\nIt is only in beta, but I have successfully used this to run various windows .exe applications under OS X 10.6.x (Snow Leopard). Be warned, not everything will work, but that is to be expected!\nHaven't got round to testing it yet in Mountain Lion yet as I have only just migrated. Hope this helps!\n\nA: Virtual machine would be another best option for you. have a look here also -\nhttp://www.pcadvisor.co.uk/how-to/software/3376910/how-open-exe-files-on-mac-os-x/\n", "Q: Is it possible to upgrade the SSD in a 2011 model Macbook Pro?

I would like to upgrade the SSD to a larger size without voiding my AppleCare.\n\n\n*\n\n*Is it possible to upgrade the SSD at all?  I have heard rumours that they are soldered in after 2010, and are not replaceable.\n\n*My city and country (Tallinn, Estonia) has no official Apple stores that I know of, but does have Apple-authorised resellers.  Are they the appropriate place to get this done?  I've replaced a hard disk on an older model MBP myself, but my current laptop is still within the warranty period.\nThis seems like a fairly common question on SO, but all questions I found are for older models or for iMacs, not MBPs.  Perhaps this should be migrated to a community wiki where the question can be updated for all models of Mac?\n\nA: To your questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is it possible to upgrade the SSD at all? I have heard rumours that they are soldered in after 2010, and are not replaceable.\nYes, it should be possible, others have done it. This video (How to Upgrade/Replace the Hard Drive in the 2011 15\" MacBook Pro) shows the procedure (just for information, I understand you don't want to void your AppleCare warranty): http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5opqLFOvh3M.\n\n*My city and country (Tallinn, Estonia) has no official Apple stores that I know of, but does have Apple-authorised resellers.

And now I'm considering buying a Mac book pro retina 15 with 256 or 512 Gb SDD as my travel laptop. I need to run both MacOS and Windows 7. The problem is that 256 and even 512 Gb is not really enough for me, so I'm considering buying an external HDD. I'm thinking about 2.5 inch 7200 rpm HDD with at least 750 Gb capacity with an enclosure which supports USB 3. I'd really like it to be very portable so I can use on a plane. It should be both accessible from MacOS and Windows. At first I thought that I would install Window 7 on this external HDD, but after reading some blog I found out that it is almost impossible because of Windows limitations. So my goal is to insert both OSs on the internal drive and keep the rest on the external HDD. \n\n\n*\n\n*Can I get some advise about this setup? \n\n*Any pitfalls like driver problems on Mac? \n\n*Any suggestions on particular hardware and software? \nMy goals are: portability and speed. \n\nA: You can't run Bootcamp from an external hard drive, but you can install Windows via a virtual machine (MV Ware or Parallels are the best known). If you install Windows on the internal drive you have the option of booting from it directly or using one of the VM machines while running Mac OS.\nAs for the hard drive size you should consider the 768GB drive if possible. The drive space goes quickly and isn't upgradable. (Well, it is, but AFAIK nobody makes larger or faster replacement drives.)\nThe OSs run independently of each other, so you don't have to worry about cross-contamination. When running BootCamp you can't even see the Macintosh partition.\nIn my experience it works as well as can be expected considering the limitations of running software on hardware that wasn't specifically designed for it.\nGood Luck.\n", "Q: How do I use iCloud to sync Pages documents from iPad to iPhone?

As a professional who frequently presents at conferences, I rely on iCloud to always have the latest version of my presentations, quoting system and forms on my gear.\nBefore you go hog-wild and build everything on your Mac, start out with a test file with the fonts and formatting you want use and ensure cross-device compatibility. iOS has a subset of Mac fonts available.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro hard drive problems: Can it be hard drive cable? My MacBook Pro 2009, (13inch, snow leopard), does not boot into OsX. I also have bootcamp windows, and I can boot into windows with no problem.\nI pressed the D key while starting and made a Apple Hardware Test. The result was recognition of the following problem: 4HDD/11/40000004:SATA(0,0)\nI tried booting with OsX installation disks and formatting the HFS partition, but the HFS partition does not SHOW UP! It only shows my other partitions (FAT and NTFS).\nIt's strange, because my bootcamp windows can see and read from my HFS partition.\n\n\n*\n\n*Do you think that my hard drive is failing? if so, why I can still read the HFS partition from windows?\n\n*Some one was suggesting that it might be a hard drive cable problem. Does anyone else have any information about it? CAN it be really a cable probelm after all? I mean I can still use it under windows with no problem, if the cable was faulty, would this be possible?\nThank you\n\nA: The most overlooked part is the cable. i've worked in an Apple tech dept for the last 8-9 years and in the 13\" MBP's i've seen Data cables/SATA cables go bad more often then the hard drive. could be from the thin factor of the drive or the drive itself causing the cable to short.\nBest bet try the cable first before you mess with any data.\n\nA: Any time you experience a hard drive (not rice!) error, it's safe to assume the worst and take the initial precaution of backing up your data... Right now, before anything gets worse! Clone the whole drive and see if the clone boots.\nOnce you have a good backup, you can play with your old drive, attempting to reformat the entire device and see if that \"fixes\" the proble. \nMy experience leads metro suggest a real simple procedure: replace the drive before you can't get anything off it. Flakey hardware tends to fail at the worst possible time.\n\nA: I just noticed how old this post is, but oh well. As b4d said, \"The symptoms were not so obvious, sometimes computer worked normally, then again it would not boot up anymore.\" I have this same problem with my MBP10. Sometimes on boot when I go to the drive selection screen, I'll see the partitions and be able to load them and it'll work fine, but then in the middle of me doing something, I'll get the spinning gear in the middle of my screen (indicating that the computer is no longer reading the hard drive) and then I reboot and hold alt and it's gone. What I did was take my hard drive out and plug it in externally until I get a new cable. \n\nA: If you buy a replacement cable, it will be fixed yes but it won't last...\nSo, you'd better decide whether you still need your DVD rom or not. If not, what the heck, remove it and change it to a caddy wherein you can install your HDD or SSD into it.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://www.amazon.com/Generic-Macbook-Unibody-Optibay-Superdrive/dp/B00GBYUS4C\n", "Q: External display with pixel density similar to macbook pro 17\" (132 ppi) I own a macbook pro 17\" late 2011 which has a 1920×1200 display with a pixel density of 132 ppi. Yesterday I tried hooking up the display to an Apple Thunderbolt Display, and to my great disappointment a window, when split across the two screens, was larger in the external Apple display than on the internal screen, due to the difference in the pixel density. I own a 24\" HD display, and there I also notice the same issue.\nI've spent some time researching, and I haven't been able to identify a potential candidate screen that has a display with comparable pixel density, and finally, size.\nI see that some have suggested (in other questions) to lower the resolution on the internal screen, but that is, in my opinion, defeating the purpose of purchasing such a laptop and I would never consider such an idea.\nWho can suggest displays, by any manufacturer, make and model, that are a good match as an external display for my MBP? The only condition I pose is that the display's resolution should be greater than the Macbook Pro's internal display resolution, as I see no advantage in using a second smaller screen.\n\nA: Unfortunately I think you're out of luck. The LCD panels that get put into computer displays are made by a relatively small number of companies. For various reasons (but primarily economies of scale) the manufacturers have settled onto a relatively small number of different panel sizes and resolutions (particularly at large resolutions), so it's pretty tough, if not impossible, to match pixel densities across different displays.\nFor resolutions higher than your MBP (1920x1200), there are really only two options on the market today:\n\n\n*\n\n*2560x1600 — used in 30\" monitors, ~101 PPI\n\n*2560x1440 — used in 27\" monitors, ~109 PPI\n\n\nEven if you go for a resolution around the same size as your MBP (1920x1200 or x1080), you can't get a similar density, as that resolution is typically only used in 21\" - 24\" external displays, resulting in PPI between 94 and 105.\nThe one device out there that does have a PPI close to your MBP is the non-retina iPad, which is pretty close to 132 PPI, but obviously you're giving up size and resolution there.\nThe next likely bump in resolution for desktop displays is probably going to be 3840x2160, which is 147 PPI in a 30\" display, so still not that close.\nYou may find this page on Wikipedia informative.\n", "Q: Why \"which\" command does not give you the correct path?

Note: It's fairly cold here some days (10'F) I'll have to check that next time it happens (probably not). \n\nA: Honestly, this sounds like a hardware problem. It wouldn't be software causing that. Chances are it's simply a bad switch. Hopefully you have AppleCare. If so, wait until it gets bad then take it in. They probably would just replace it. Otherwise - purchase AppleCare if you're still within the time. ;-) \nI suppose there is also the possibility something like that could come from something somehow getting in the switch, or damage from a drop. Likely not the case for you, but I think it could happen.\nAgain, in conclusion, it's probably a bad switch.\n\nA: I agree with Bassplayer (great name BTW) in that it's a hardware issue. But just to expand on it, I've had the same issue with my iPhone 4S and because I bought it used, taking it to the Apple store isn't an option. \nMy solution until I get a new phone, is to use the AssistiveTouch to turn my phone off and put it to sleep (along with other functions like taking a screenshot). \nIf you haven't heard, the AssistiveTouch is a white, translucent dot on the screen that when tapped opens a context menu that will give you options for Sleep mode, powering off, among others. \nYou can turn this on in:\n\nSettings > General > Accessibility > AssistiveTouch On\n\nYou can also toggle the display of the dot with:\n\nSettings > General > Accessibility > Triple-click Home set to AssistiveTouch. \n\nThis way you can hide the white dot when it gets in the way.\n", "Q: Disable second monitor The problem\nI have a 2008 iMac running OS X 10.7 with its mini-DVI output port connected to an second monitor via a DVI-D adapter.\nIt's nice having a second monitor, but it's sometimes superfluous and I would like to turn it off to conserve power.\nIdeally, I would like the iMac to detect when I turn off the second monitor and then stop extending the display onto it. But that's not what happens; I need to unplug the DVI cable before the iMac recognizes it as removed.\nExplored solutions\nMirroring the display: The second monitor is in portrait orientation, so mirroring turns the display into rather comically cropped square.\nMoving the display arrangement to eliminate common borders: The display is still there, so applications sometimes still open up windows on it.\nA hardware solution like a KVM switch or the product described here: I'd rather not.\nThis question is more in line with what I'm looking for, but they ultimately went in a different direction. Is there a viable solution using XRandR, though?\nFinally, if there are no OS X native solutions for disabling a monitor, I suppose I must ask: is there an app for that?\n\nA: One possible solution is SwitchResX, however, it costs money, and personally I would prefer an AppleScript or shell command for that purpose.\n", "Q: What makes autofill not appear as a sync option in iTunes 11?

With your device plugged in it will be where the auto fill should be. I don't keep music on my iPad, when it got done syncing I disconnected my iPad and autofill did not show back up. don't know if it is because I don't keep music on the device or not, but it was there before I synced.\n\nA: I figured it out, all you have to go is go to your iPhone and go to the tab \"on this iPhone\" then you can autofill at the bottom! \n", "Q: Hide/Remove a Key from Keychain Access Is there a way to hide a key (i.e. a wifi WPA key password) from being listed in Keychain Access but still have OS X be able to use it?

This requires knowing the windowid of the Google Chrome process that's running.\nFor apps that support Applescript, this question has the answer. But that solution doesn't work for apps that aren't scriptable, like Google Chrome.\nIs there any way to retrieve the windowid from a running Google Chrome process from a Python script? I know that the Quartz Debug app can do it, but that's a GUI app, so it can't be invoked via script.\n\nA: You can do that with GrabFS, a screenshot filesystem for OS X. (Download at the bottom of the page. Works fine for me on 10.8.2 with OSXFUSE) It gives you the textures of any processes windows as files which you can simply copy.

Title says it all: how do I lock the screen using a keyboard shortcut on OS X Mountain Lion with a Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000?\n\nA: Assuming your keyboard has an eject button, you need to go to System Preferences, and click on \"Security & Privacy\", then click on the \"General\" tab, then select the checkbox that says \"Require password immediately after sleep or screensaver begins\". Now you can lock your computer by pressing Control-Shift-Eject. This puts the computer to sleep, but because we've told it to lock on sleep, it also locks it.\nIf your computer doesn't have an eject button, you will need to create your own custom shortcut. Unfortunately, you can only create shortcuts for menu items and services. Fortunately you can create a service to put the display to sleep (and thus lock the screen), and you can assign a shortcut to the service. For instructions on how to do this, see this Macworld page.\n\nA: Open System Preferences -> Keyboard -> Shortcuts -> App Shortcuts. Click on +. Select All Application for Application, enter Sleep for Menu Title, press the desired shortcut in the Keyboard Shortcut field. Click on Add. See the Apple menu (an apple icon in the top left corner). The Sleep entry should show the shortcut you have defined. The shortcut should work right away.\n\nNote that Finder and possibly some other applications would only react to the shortcut after the reboot.\n\nA: You do not need to use Third Party Apps to set a global short cut.\nYou can use Automator Services,System Preferences keyboard Shortcuts and the CGSession -suspend command that switches to a login screen.\nUse the Applescript :\ndo shell script \"/System/Library/CoreServices/Menu\\\\ Extras/User.menu/Contents/Resources/CGSession -suspend\"\n\nin a Automator 'Service' like this with the set up as no input and all applications.\n\nSave it and then go to the Keyboard System Preferences. -> Keyboard Shortcuts tab.  Select Services on the right. And scroll down to the bottom on the left to 'General'. There you will see your service. Click the addShortCut. And give the service a shortcut. Clost system prefs.\n\nYou may need to quit some apps and re open them first for them to pick up the short cut for the first time. You can see the ones that have already picked it up..\n\nNow try the shortcut from the keyboard.\n\nA: You can easily add the padlock icon to your menu bar:\nopen /Applications/Utilities/Keychain\\ Access.app/Contents/Resources/Keychain.menu\n\nYou can also add it through Keychain Access prefs. ;)\n\nA: Or you can go to: Applications > Utilities > Keychain Access > Preferences > Show keychain status in menu bar.\nThis will put a lock in your menu bar and you can click Lock Screen to lock your screen. If you need a keyboard shortcut, you can add this in your keyboard under Settings.\n\nAlso, here are steps to use a shortcut to put your computer in screen saver mode which locks your Mac at the same time.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open System Preferences.\n\n*Select Security & Privacy.\n\n*Select General.\n\n*Be sure Require password [immediately] after sleep or screen saver\nbegins is selected.\n\n*Go to your applications folder.\n\n*Open Automator.\n\n*Select Services on the screen that appears.\n\n*At the top of the new Service's actions, in the Service receives\ndrop-down, select no input from the options. Make sure that any\napplication is selected in the second drop-down. \n\n*Add the Start Screensaver action (in the Utilities group of actions)\nto the Service by dragging it to the right. \n\n*Save the Service (Automator does not ask you where to save it, just\nto name it Logout for example). \n\n*Next, open System Preferences again and select the Keyboard\npreference pane.  Select the Shortcuts tab at the top, then\nthe Services group on the left. \n\n*The service you created should be near the bottom of the list of\nServices under the General disclosure triangle. \n\n*Double-click on the right side of the entry for the Service you\ncreated and assign a keyboard shortcut.\n\n*I chose Command-Shift-L for my shortcut.\n\n*Exit the keyboard preference pane and give it a try.\n\n\nYou can always use Control+Shift+Eject (if you have a mac keyboard) or Control+Shift+Power on your mac to put your computer to sleep, but I don’t want that when I can just close the mba lid. We all know about hot corners, but I’m not a big fan of it as it always interferes with other options. \nI had been using the lock menu icon for the longest time found in Applications > Utilities > Keychain Access > Preferences > Show keychain status in menu bar but it just takes too long sometimes to click that small icon when I’m in a rush since the target is so small.\n\nA: UPDATE -  2021 answer is - ctrl-win-q\nlegacy below\nI used KeyRemap4Macbook to remap the pause/break key to eject.  KeyRemap4Macbook is free, and it shows up in System Preferences after installing.\nshift+ctrl+pause/break does the trick now.\n\nFor newer versions of the OS (Sierras, El Cap) there is the new Karabiner-Elements with a slightly different interface:\n\n**Please note that KeyRemap4Macbook is now called Karabiner with the same functionality.\n**update for Sierra - Karabiner **\n\n\nA: Control+Shift+Eject is the keystroke for Macs with an Eject key, and for external keyboards\nControl+Shift+Power is the keystroke for Macs without the eject key, like the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro Retina\nhttp://osxdaily.com/2011/01/17/lock-screen-mac/\n\nA: By default, you can use Ctrl+Command+Q.\n\nA: You can also log out to the fast user switching screen, but it doesn't turn off displays. Just assign a shortcut to this shell command:\n/System/Library/CoreServices/Menu\\ Extras/user.menu/Contents/Resources/CGSession -suspend\n\nIf you have the Alfred Powerpack, you can give the lock action a shortcut in the hotkeys tab:\n\n\nA: Note that there's also an alternative method which frees you of remembering obscure key combinations and uses English (or other) words instead: with Alfred or possibly Quicksilver (not sure tho), you can invoke actions such as locking the screen, all via a single hotkey and a bunch of commands in plain language. OSX's Spotlight is moving in the same direction — but I'm not sure if it's quite there yet; though you probably can run AppleScript files with it.\n\nA: I stand corrected, trach a man to fish:\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201236\n\nA: You can install the tiny, free SleepDisplay application, and assign it to any key in the Microsoft Keyboard section of System Preferences. \n\nA: @markhunte's answer is good, but it falls short when you're in an app that doesn't have a \"Services\" menu (e.g., Calculator).\nInstead of using System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts to assign the shortcut, I use Apptivate: it's a free, lightweight utility whose only purpose is to run a command when you press a hotkey sequence.\nOnce you've created a \"Lock Screen\" service in Automator (as described by @markhunte's answer), you simply add it to Apptivate:\n\nWhen the \"Open\" dialog is displayed, press CMD+SHIFT+G (Go to Folder) and enter ~/Library/Services:\n\nThen select the Automator service you created earlier:\n\nFinally, assign a keyboard shortcut to the service:\n\nAnd that's it!  Now you have a \"Lock Screen\" keyboard shortcut that can be used in any application.\n\nA: My system version is Yosemite 10.10.5. And the method posted by markhunte is still working except that you need input username everytime after you suspend the system. It's a little annoying to me. So changed the script from:\ndo shell script \"/System/Library/CoreServices/Menu\\\\ Extras/User.menu/Contents/Resources/CGSession -suspend\"\n\nto:\ntell application \"System Events\" to sleep\n\nThis script just simulates that you click the sleep menu item of system menu.\n\nA: If you use the new MacBook Pro or a Windows / external keyboard, use a program like Karabiner Elements to map from a key you choose to \"Eject\", so that the good old CTRL-SHIFT-EJECT works.\nFor example:\n\n\nA: There's a little app which does the trick — http://keylock.io\n\nA: Ctrl+Shift+PwrBtn\nUsing an original iMac orange keyboard on a 2011 MacBook Pro. \n", "Q: Question about defining custom paragraph styles in Pages I have been using Pages to wrote TV Show scripts, as I've found it to be less restrictive than celtx, and cheaper than final draft.\nIt's been working really well, I just defined a bunch of custom paragraph styles, and I select the relevant one as needed.\nThis doesn't take much overhead, but there are a few things I would like to be able to do.\nBasically, there are certain things that should be enforced between the styles. I've attached a screenshot of a script I've written to better illustrate what I'm referring to:\n\nIn most cases, when there is the name of a character, i.e. PHIL, or CLAIRE, it should be followed by the paragraph style that you see in the screenshot. Is there someway to have it set up so that when I press enter to go to a new line while I'm entering a characters name, the paragraph style of the new line is that of the dialog?\nAlso, when there is a name heading at the bottom of the page, the dialog is the first thing at the top of the next page, but the name heading should be grouped with the dialog on the next page. Is there some way to enforce this? The problem is illustrated in the below image.\n\nThanks!\n\nA: You control both those issues from the MORE tab on the Text Inspector window.\nThe drop-down Following Paragraph Style will determine what the next paragraph's style settings are.\nFor example, if your paragraph style for character names is called CHARACTERS and for dialog it is called DIALOG what you do is select a bit of text that is using the CHARACTERS style, then in the MORE tab, set the Following Paragraph Style to DIALOG.\nLikewise, you set the page break parameters in the same MORE tab.\nBy selecting the Keep with following paragraph will force the CHARACTERS style to always be on the same page as the next paragraph. If there is enough room to display the CHARACTERS line and at least 3 lines of the DIALOG the text will start on the current page and then continue on the next page. If there isn't enough room to display the CHARACTERS line and at least 3 lines of the DIALOG, the whole group will be pushed onto the next page.\n\nAccording to Apple:\n\nKeeping Paragraphs Together on a Page\nYou can choose to make two paragraphs appear on the same page. The last line of the first paragraph will always remain on the same page as the beginning of the next paragraph, unless you insert a page or section break between them.\nThis is most useful for single-line, header paragraphs that you want to keep with the topic paragraphs following.\n  To keep paragraphs together on a page:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Click the paragraph that you want to keep with the paragraph following it.\n  \n*Click Inspector in the toolbar, click the Text button, and then click More.\n  \n*Select “Keep with following paragraph.”\n  \n\nIf you want to keep the entire paragraph on the same page (so, not have it break across pages, you select Keep lines together.\n\nKeeping an Entire Paragraph on the Same Page\nYou can make all the lines in a paragraph always appear on the same page.\nTo avoid breaking a paragraph across pages:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Click the paragraph whose lines you want to remain together.\n  \n*Click Inspector in the toolbar, click the Text button, and then click More.\n  \n*Select “Keep lines together.”\n  \n\nOnce your style is set, you then either create a new paragraph style or you redefine the existing paragraph style to reflect the changes you just made.\n\nA: Hi This may or may not help.\nfor your first question.  It looks like you cannot group more than on Paragraph style together. But the is a Following Paragraph style option under the 'more' tab in the Text inspector.\nYou could setup a Automator Service  that runs this code:\ntell document 1 of application \"Pages\"\n    set theSelection to selection\n    set newStyle to a reference to paragraph style \"Name of Person\"\n    set bodyStyle to a reference to paragraph style \"Body\"\n    set paragraph style of theSelection to newStyle\n    set following paragraph style of theSelection to bodyStyle\nend tell\n\nYou will not be able to control click text and select the service. Because for some reason apple has not deigned to put the Service contextual menu in page. But it will be under the Service Menu in the Menu Bar. Which you can assign a keyboard shortcut to the Service.\nSelect the CHARACTER  and hit the shortcut.\nThe service will set the CHARACTER to the correct Paragraph style and the following one to another.\nYou second question.

Or is it \"inside\"?\nIf it were up to me, I would be inclined to locate the recovery partition \"outside\" on the spinny disk, but before my SSD and retrofit kit comes in the mail, I'd like to know how Apple did it.\n\nA: Ars Technica did an article on how to roll your own Fusion Drive and one that details the layout of an Apple installed Fusion drive from a Mac Mini.\nFrom that article:\nLeeHs-Mac-mini:~ leeh$ diskutil list\n/dev/disk0\n#: TYPE NAME SIZE IDENTIFIER\n0: GUID_partition_scheme *121.3 GB disk0\n1: EFI 209.7 MB disk0s1\n2: Apple_CoreStorage 121.0 GB disk0s2\n3: Apple_Boot Boot OS X 134.2 MB disk0s3\n/dev/disk1\n#: TYPE NAME SIZE IDENTIFIER\n0: GUID_partition_scheme *1.0 TB disk1\n1: EFI 209.7 MB disk1s1\n2: Apple_CoreStorage 999.3 GB disk1s2\n3: Apple_Boot Recovery HD 650.0 MB disk1s3\n/dev/disk2\n#: TYPE NAME SIZE IDENTIFIER\n0: Apple_HFS Macintosh HD *1.1 TB disk2\n\n\nLeeHs-Mac-mini:~ leeh$ diskutil cs list\n    CoreStorage logical volume groups (1 found)\n    |\n    +-- Logical Volume Group 31CBA650-4ABC-4DA6-AA73-6D96B36693E2\n        =====================================================\n        Name:         Macintosh HD\n        Size:         1120333979648 B (1.1 TB)\n        Free Space:   0 B (0 B)\n        |\n        +-< Physical Volume F4A50F9C-841D-4C6D-AFC4-6A10560E0717\n        |   ----------------------------------------------------\n        |   Index:    0\n        |   Disk:     disk0s2\n        |   Status:   Online\n        |   Size:     120988852224 B (121.0 GB)\n        |\n        +-< Physical Volume C86789FD-1978-453A-BCA7-81DC05AA66C7\n        |   ----------------------------------------------------\n        |   Index:    1\n        |   Disk:     disk1s2\n        |   Status:   Online\n        |   Size:     999345127424 B (999.3 GB)\n        |\n        +-> Logical Volume Family AA92FDF8-F962-4DE3-AC2F-1B6ABF22AA22\n            ------------------------------------------------------\n            Encryption Status:       Unlocked\n            Encryption Type:         None\n            Conversion Status:       NoConversion\n            Conversion Direction:    -none-\n            Has Encrypted Extents:   No\n            Fully Secure:            No\n            Passphrase Required:     No\n            |\n            +-> Logical Volume B97C9558-14FC-4BFC-B413-AFB292BD29F0\n                -----------------------------------------------\n                Disk:               disk2\n                Status:             Online\n                Size (Total):       1115853029376 B (1.1 TB)\n                Size (Converted):   -none-\n                Revertible:         No\n                LV Name:            Macintosh HD\n                Volume Name:        Macintosh HD\n                Content Hint:       Apple_HFS\n\nAs you can see, the recovery partition is \"outside\" the Core Storage volume which gets mounted by the OS and functions as \"the Fusion Drive\". The Fusion Drive is comprised of one standard partition from each disk, rather than using the full drive and storing the configuration data out of or in-band by hiding it. Everything we know so far about standard Fusion Drives is pretty straightforward and transparent.\n\nA: For what it's worth, I've gotten this working now. For anyone coming along behind me, I managed to get the volumes backwards - in my 'diskutil cs list' output, the spinny disk is   index 0 and the SSD is index 1. Despite this, it appears to be behaving exactly how Fusion Drives are documented to work - all of the writes are hitting the SSD until it is full, and then overflow is going to the spinny disk.\n", "Q: iOS calendar crashed on March 2013 When selecting March 2013 in the Month view, Calendar crashes. Does anyone know what could be the cause of this ?\nPs: I tried march 2012 and the weekly view for march 2013 and there is no problem. \nPs2: it's on a iPad 3 with iOS 6.0.1 \nPs3: I've tried the same thing on my father's iPad : It's crashes also on march 2013. (the synchronized calendar are totaly different)  \nPs4: Just found out that Facebook's birthdays are crashing the app on my iPad. \n\nA: I would like to report that the update to iOS 6.1 solves this problem. I had the issue and now it's gone.\n\nA: This will happen if you have an all-day event on 1-Apr-2013. If you remove this event it won't crash.\n\nA: It seems that having an event that merely starts between 0:00 and 0:59 on 2013-04-01 causes Calendar to crash when viewing March in month view. All-day events start at midnight, so this affects them too.\nMoreover, if I create an event that starts on 2013-03-31 23:55 and ends at 2013-04-01 0:55, Calendar shows the event would magically go back in time and end on 2013-02-25:\n\nI'd suggest to file a bug report on the issue\n\nA: Jus tried this on my iPad 3 with iOS 6.0.1, no issue.\nWhat calendars are syncing/subscribed to? Try temporarily disabling your accounts in Mail, Contacts, Calendars to see if that’s what affect it.\n", "Q: backing up to iCloud, and restoring from computer I have 60GB of photos on my iPhone, so I can't back it up to iCloud, I suppose even if I bought the max iCloud plan from Apple? If I turn on iCloud backup for this device and disable photos it can be backed up (at aprox 1.5GB). \nWith these iCloud settings, I assume manual backups to the computer will be unaffected, that is: they will still back up all data from the phone to the computer, including photos. Am I correct?\nThe plan is to use iCloud to restore my phone (contacts and apps) in case of emergency, but to have a main backup on my Mac to restore all photos etc. Am I on the right track here?\nThanks for reading.\n\nA: So much confusion over iCloud, so little help from Apple.\niCloud was introduced as an sync service between all your Macs and iDevices. Yes, one can buy storage beyond the free 5GB ... but I'd look closely at the specifics of backing and and restore, and also give it a trial run. Too many posts on lost data and the like on Apple Discussions to think Apple's got the cloud down pat, not yet. \nBacking up to your Mac, however, is solid, you've probably got more than enough free space (check that out.) In many cases, I just zip a copy of the relevant folder and drop it into ~/Users/Shared. \nBUT, you really want a second location for irreplaceable things like photos. This could be on a portable USB drive, which could also serve as a clone--nothing like having a copy of your whole computer on a start-up disk. I recommend spending also a few bucks a month on off-site backups to A3, using Arq, by Haystack Software, for automatic timed backups of files that change. The restore function is easy and impeccable. \n", "Q: How to manage a huge folder collection in two places I have a huge collection of movies (over 2,000) on my external hard drive, and since my girlfriend doesn't like those old movies, she would like to make distinguish between the old movies and those from the last 5 years.\nAt this moment, every movie has it's own folder containing a movie file and a .srt file. Consequently I have a very long list of movies.\nWhat I would like to do is to make two directories in the root, organized: \n\n\n*\n\n*by year \n\n*by alphabet\n\n\nThe 'by year' folder would contain folders like \"2012\", \"2011\", etc., and the alphabet folder would simply contain all the movie folders in a long list.  \nMaintaining both these folders is obviously a very hard thing to do, not to mention the extra space it will require to have every movie-folder duplicated. \nIs there a way to do what I want without duplicating every movie folder? \n\nA: Create your 2012 movie folder.  Hold down the command key and left mouse click to select each movie folder that has a movie made in 2012.  Once you have them all selected (with the command key down) hold down the alt key, and \"move\" the aliases that are created for all of the movie folders you selected into the 2012 folder.  What this does is create a pointer to the original file/folder, it doesn't actually copy the folder and contents.  It's just a representation and \"points\" to the location of the original folder.  This way you won't waste space (it's like 1kb per alias).\nDo this for each of the year folders, and each of the alphabet folders.  Seems like an easy way not to waste space.\n", "Q: Is Other World Computing's 1.5TB Toshiba Aquarius laptop hard drive legit? I have pretty high storage needs, which are constantly increasing. Fortunately, the largest drives available seem to be scaling with the amount of space I can occupy. The 1TB disk I currently have sitting in the Superdrive bay of my 15\" Macbook Pro (Mid 2010) is making me nervous with its loud seeking. I'm going to replace it for sure, but it seems as though laptop disks above 1TB are not yet readily available (besides the 15mm tall form factor, which is no good for MBPs). I noticed that Other World Computing is selling this drive, Toshiba part no. MQ01ABD150, but I can't seem to find any info outside of OWC. I know they carry some specialist products not always readily available elsewhere, but am I right to be skeptical of this drive? Anyone know anything about it, i.e. whether it will truly fit a 15\" unibody MBP?\nUpdate\nAn OWC representative said that the drive would actually be too big to fit a MBP, in either bay.  So the wait for a larger-than-1TB laptop drive continues.\n\nA: Other World Computing is a very reputable Apple specialist and I don't doubt that the Toshiba drive is compatible. If they list your particular Macbook Pro in the compatibility list, then it surely should fit. And the description mentions 12.5mm height which also confirms it should work.\nAnd a quick Google search on the Toshiba part # MQ01ABD150 yields several results on other availabilities of that drive, albeit more limited than many smaller capacities.\nIt's worth noting that it is a 5400rpm drive and not 7200rpm, which you would be even less likely to find, if 7200rpm drives at that capacity even exist in the notebook compatible (12.5mm height or less) variety yet.\n\nA: I bought the 1.5TB 12.5mm 2.5\" internal Toshiba hard drive and installed it in my mid-2009 MBP15. It fit perfectly. \nYou can't imagine how much better it is than the original 500GB HDD that came inside my MBP. I have a 1TB partition for OSX and a 500GB partition for Win7. I have all the elbow room I could possibly need for years to come. \nBefore I bought it, I already knew that 12.5mm z-height HDDs fit inside the MBP because I saw a YouTube video of a guy installing a 1TB 12.5mm HDD. \nIf you hurry, you can catch the holiday sale. I got it for $125. \n", "Q: Where can I find information on the licence(s) that govern use of the fonts that come preinstalled on Mac OS X? I've just read the licence for the Hoefler font (see their EULA).  It says explicitly:\n\nYou may not create Embedded Documents, except as expressly provided in paragraphs 3.2 and 3.3:\n\nand \"Embedded Documents\" includes \"ordinary\" PDFs.\nNow it may be that Apple has a different licence that is in force when I \"bought\" this font through Mac OS X.  If so, where do I find it?  (More generally, for any font distributed with Mac OS X.)  I'd quite like to know that if I create a PDF with one of these fonts then I'm not breaking the law.\n\nA: From the os license:\nE. Fonts. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, you may use the fonts included with the Apple Software to display and print content while running the Apple Software; however, you may only embed fonts in content if that is permitted by the embedding restrictions accompanying the font in question.

I wonder if someone can shed some light on this.  I live in the UK but am travelling to Austalia for Christmas.  If I buy a cellular iPad mini in Australia, will that work when I bring it back to the UK?  \nObviously I will need to put a UK SIM card in there, but apart from that, will there be any issues?  \nMany thanks in advance\nCharlie\n\nA: According the LTE page at Apple.com the model in UK and Australia should be compatible:\nModel number:\n\niPad mit Retina Display (4.

I am syncing photos through iTunes to my iphone but I am seeing 40 events with the same date show in the Events selector. The same photos are included within a single event in iPhoto. How can i get iTunes to see these events as one? \n\nA: I have same problem with iphoto latest version 9.4.2. At genius bar nobody know a solution. Genius talked to Cupertino, they know about the problem, we have to wait for an update for iphoto software.  I tried using \"iphoto library manager\" software (not apple) to recover the iphoto library. Apparently problem was solved in itunes, but iphoto became very slow and i came back to normal iphoto library.\nIn itunes events have a date as a name and each contains few pics, some of them have been deleted from the iphoto library but still in those strangfe events, maybe as a miniature.\nSomebody can help?\nDeleting ipod photo cache non solution, unfortunately.\n", "Q: Standby during playback since iTunes 11 Since I upgraded to iTunes 11, my iMac (27\", 2011) goes to sleep during playback to my Apple TV. This didn't happen before the upgrade, so it has to be related to the upgrade. Does anyone what I could do to prevent this from happening? It's kind of annoying. Standard standby time for the iMac is 10 minutes. Thus, after 10 minutes of playback my iMac goes to sleep. Both, my iMac and my Apple TV are running the most up-to-date software.\n\nA: I think the only way to prevent this from happening right now is to increase your standby time.\nThe reason it goes to sleep is that iTunes 11 does not set a \"power assertion\". Here's an Open Radar bug report on this issue: http://openradar.appspot.com/12791690.\nHopefully Apple will change this in an update because I'm having the same annoying problem.\nUpdate 2012-12-13: iTunes 11.0.1 just came out and the missing power assertion has returned. Your computer should no longer sleep when streaming to the AppleTV.\n\nA: I solved my problem. I simply restarted my Apple TV.\nDespite the fact, that my problem occured after installing iTunes 11.0.0 (and later 11.0.1 the problem got solved by restating my Apple TV. \n", "Q: How to use a 3 TB hard drive on a MacBookPro7.1 I have bought this hard drive: Seagate ST3000DM which is a 3TB 3.5\" hard drive. When I connect it via a USB2 docking station, here is what OS X sees:\nDisk Description :  ST3000DM 001-9YN166 Media   Total Capacity :    801.57 GB (801 569 726 464 Bytes)\nConnection Bus :    USB Write Status :  Read/Write\nConnection Type :   External    S.M.A.R.T. Status : Not Supported\nUSB Serial Number : (removed)   Partition Map Scheme :  Unformatted\n\nIs there a software solution to this problem ? I have seen solutions that imply to buy a USB3 docking station but MacBookPro 7.1 only have USB2 ports.\nIs there an hardware solution that don't imply buying a NAS, which is about two or three times the price of the disk itself ?\n\nA: I'm concerned that the Partition Map Scheme shows up as \"Unformatted\".\nI suggest you run Disk Utility and format the drive with Mac OSX Extended (Journaled) format to see what happens to the Total Capacity and to set the PM Scheme (which should be GUID).\n\nA: Check with seagate for firmware for Apple products, I have one Seagate drive that needed the firmware. Sadly to say but but I have not had very good luck using this with time machine. I need another call to Segate, by the way they have beeb very helpful in the past.\n", "Q: Two laptops authorized to play my iTunes library; what can each laptop see? There are two computers authorized to play my iTunes library; one is my main laptop and I sync my iPhone and iPad to this. The second laptop is an old one which I gave to a friend when I upgraded. I have no objections to her playing from my library. However, I am concerned now that she has bought her first iPhone. \nWhen she syncs her device, what data (contacts, mail, texts etc.) will she be able to see of mine and vice versa?\nAlso if I download Apps will she automatically see them and vice versa?\n\nA: You've actually posed two questions.\nFor the iTunes library, I'm assuming you've gone to the menu and Authorized This Machine to access your content. This authorizes the computer to access your paid content, meaning movies, tv shows, and songs downloaded through iTuens or via iTunes Match (if you enabled that on this machine too).\nFor contacts from your phone, did you enable iCloud on your old computer? If so you could have possibly enabled cloud syncing of contacts, mail, and calendar events. If you did this, then your friend will be getting whatever information you enabled. Thus to answer your other question, in this case she will automatically get your information.\nKeep in mind that the Home Sharing feature, iTunes Match, and iTunes authorization End User Agreement License covers your household; thus, by allowing your friend to access your content you're technically violating the terms of service agreement.\nIf you want to to maintain your privacy, on your old machine go to System Preferences > iCloud and sign out. This will take care of your privacy concerns of contacts. In iTunes, go to Store > De Authorize This Computer, then Store > Sign Out\n\nA: There are two ways to share your library: local network iTunes sharing and Home Sharing (capital H, capital S). \nIn the first case, the other person can see your content if both laptops are turned on and iTunes is open, but can't download it. This is best for casual music sharing, etc. \nIn the second case, either person can import items from iTunes libraries on the other computer, including apps. This is the same as sharing the same Apple ID, which would also mean that the other person can download content and leave you with the charges on your credit card. It's possible, since you're the former owner of the laptop, that you set this up by simply leaving the iTunes settings as they were and authorizing your new laptop to the same iTunes account. In this case probably the easiest thing to do is to change your password and tell your friend that she needs to set up her own Apple ID to use with iTunes.\n", "Q: How can I change the font used in Preview PDF notes? As of Mountain Lion, Preview has been \"upgraded\" with a ridiculous font choice for its Notes (Control-Command-N). I use them all the time in PDF files and suffer from the Comic Sans feeling of Marker Felt.\nIs it possible to change the font used by Preview to show notes?\nIt does not seem that the question has already been asked.\n\nA: Sadly, it is not possible to change the font used by Preview for Notes - this is denoted by Apple an 'UnEditable'.\nThis thread on the Apple forums (which I can't take credit for) provides a couple of work arounds such as using Annotations instead of notes (as these are editable) or post-editing comments in Adobe Acrobat Reader XI, but not an actual solution to this problem.\n\nA: Go to Font Book, select Noteworthy, right click and show the font file in Finder. Alternatively you can directly navigate to /System/Library/Fonts\nReplace the extension of the Noteworthy font file with .disabled (or .bak, or anything else non-font related). Make sure with the Inspector that the extension has not been re-added by the Finder. This is how it should look:\n\nRe-start Preview, all PDF notes are now shown in Helvetica.\nTested on 10.8 and 10.9.\n\nA: I believe the method of editing the font file directly is no longer applicable in the newest OSX because those files are read-only and it probably won't be wise to mess them.\nTry Adobe Reader instead?\n", "Q: Select the first or last file in finder with the keyboard, or disable filename sort in finder I'm renaming a long series of file one by one while previewing them. UNFORTUNATELY, Finder re-sorts the file list, so that means that each time I rename a file, it changes the current selection to the end, so I need to quickly go to either the first file or the last in the list.\nOn windows explorer, when I hit end or home, it selects the last or first file. It can be quite useful when browsing a long series of files. On top of this, on mac you can have a preview of the file which is very handy.\nFinder seems to have a different behaviour, I have a macbook pro, so I either it FN-left or FN-right to simulate those keystrokes, but it does nothing. Also the keyboard viewer display a different symbol when I hit FN-enter, I don't really know what that is.\nAlternatively, I could just tell Finder to not sort files at all, just leave them in place. Is there a way to do this?\nPS sorry for some reason, access to google https is not authorized with mac at my library, so I can't login at all.\n\nA: Just wanted to add that joelseph's answer to press ESC and UP or Down is correct for versions of OS X prior to Mavericks. It appears that Apple have repurposed the ESC key in Mavericks Finder and no longer deselects files. \nLri's answer (to press ⌥↑ or ⌥↓), however, still works in Mavericks.\n\nA: With either View > as List (Cmd+2) or View > as Columns (Cmd+3) enabled, you can select the item at the top / bottom with Opt+↑ / Opt+↓, respectively.\nIf you enable/disable View > Use Groups (Ctrl+Cmd+0), Finder will move its selection to the first column at the top.\n\nA: You can disable sorting for a folder in icon view (⌘0) by holding down option, clicking the View menu, and selecting None under Sort By (alternatively, press ⌃⌥⌘0).\nThat should allow you to rename your files without losing your place in the list.\nAs an aside, the home and end keys function a bit differently from Windows. In Windows they move the insertion point (in a text document) or selection, but in Mac they just move the view, not what's selected or where your text insertion point is. If you want to quickly jump to the first or last file in Finder, you can use A or Z — if you have lots of numbers at the start of the filename, or several z's, it may not put you exactly at the start or end, but it should be close enough in most cases.\n\nA: An easy way to select the first or last file is to press Esc to clear the current selection, then press ↓ to select the first file or ↑ to select the last file. \nIn many cases, pressing ↓ or ↑ immediately after pressing Return to commit the new name will select the next or previous file before the Finder resorts the list.\n\nA: If you want to find any other file, simply type in the full title or even the first couple of characters and Finder will take you straight to it - whether it begins with a letter, a numeral or a character, but the result might be just above the top of the viewing window, so you'll have to scroll up to see it.\n", "Q: Yahoo Mail on iPhone won't let me delete email Suddenly, my yahoo on iPhone won't let me respond to or delete any email?  What have I done?\n\nA: Make sure that you are signed in. Sometimes you get disconnected and the auth mechanism doesn't re-authenticate you. (IMAP auth) *assuming you are using the Mail.app)\nWorst case, you can delete your yahoo mail setup and re-configure it. \n\nA: Since the iOS 9 upgrade my yahoo account wouldn't let me delete emails through the apple mail app. I tried deleting the account and adding it again but still no luck. Then I found the following site and it fixed the problem. http://www.macissues.com/2015/01/22/fix-mail-unable-to-move-messages-on-your-iphone-or-ipad/\nYay!  Hope this helps someone else. \n\nA: Go into mail, touch accounts, go to advance touch the email account, make sure draft is checked and not trash can, check send\nAnd email. This fixed the I can't send this email to trash. Apple couldn't fix it nor Verizon. This is in a iPhone 7s\n", "Q: Using SSH-LPR with Mac? I'm looking for a way to add a printer to my MacBook that prints using the lpr command on a remote server. I have passwordless logins set up, and I found a script that appears to do what I need it to: SSH-LPR Backend for CUPS. The only problem is setting it up.\nI figured out that on Mac, /usr/lib/cups/backend is actually /usr/libexec/cups/backend, and I added, and chmod'd the sshlpr script to that folder.\nThen I went to http://localhost:631/ after cupsctl WebInterface=yes, but I don't see an option to add an SSH-LPR printer.\nWhat do I do next?\n\nA: I figured it out eventually. Turns out all I needed to do was restart the CUPS daemon.\nA simple killall cupsd followed by refreshing the web interface did the trick.\nI got the option to add an \"LPR through SSH\" printer, and it shows up Print & Scan as well as my applications.\n", "Q: Siri location reminders problem I have added my favorite stores, Coffee shops, and addresses I go to a lot, into my contacts list, so I can say to Siri \"Remind me to check the mail when I arrive at mom's house.\" However, Siri responds with \"I am sorry I can remind you at work, home, or gym.\" \nSo what am I doing wrong?\n\nA: On the surface it sounds as if you're doing everything right; I have however found this process to not always be quite as straight forward as one might think.  For starters, I've found that newly added contact data is not immediately available to Siri.  I have had to wait as long as 5 to 10 minutes before she recognizes the new entry.  Once the data parses through iCloud though, she usually gets it without missing a beat.  Another tip that I've picked up is using nicknames for locations to make speaking them a little easier.  For example, I travel regularly for business, so as soon as I arrive, I add the hotel address to my contact list and provide it a nickname of \"The Hotel\"; That way I can simply ask to be reminded when I leave the hotel instead of when I leave \"Omni Hotel and Spa Downtown LA\".  I of course have to change this nickname every time I check into a new hotel but if you frequent the same coffee shop or supermarket, it should work quite well for you.\nOn another note, in order to use your example of \"Remind me to check the mail when I arrive at Mom's House\", you must first assign the relationship of \"Mother\" to a specific person in your contact list (unless of course you have your mother listed in your contacts as simply \"Mom\" as opposed to a full name).  You can do this either in the contact edit screen of your own contact by adding the field \"Related People\" or you can simply tell Siri \"Sally Smith is my Mother\".  You can also get Siri to recognize the relationship by giving a command using the relationship, such as \"Call my Mom\"  if the relationship is not set, Siri will ask you who your mother is.\nIf you're still having trouble after trying some of this let me know in the comments, we can work through exactly what you're doing step by step and drill down the problem.\n", "Q: Difference between saving and exporting I have read several questions (here and elsewhere) that look for applications that can save in a format instead of export in a format.  What is the difference between saving in a format, and exporting in a format?  Is it just that there is an additional dialog box, or does an exported file in some way behave differently?  Is this a style over substance issue?\nI have no problem with people wanting things the WAY they want them, I just want to understand if there is a fundamental difference in the function of an exported over the function of a saved file.\nExamples:  Pages exports in formats that Open Office saves in.  Pixelmator exports in formats that PhotoShop saves in (so I've been told).\n\nA: AS @lhf comments export/import implies that there is some information lost during one of the processes so that you can't export and then import and get exactly the same document back.\nSave usually writes the file in the format that is native to the application or in the same format as the file was opened in.\nSome applications e.g. Microsoft Office will not use export as much as this but use save as to allow conversion of the format of the document and possibly lose some information e.g. Excel can save as .csv. (I don't have MS Office here and can't remember if they have an export on the file menu). The do have an import that adds the selected document to the current one so another meaning.\nThe examples you give are both that the file file format is native to an application ( Open Office and PhotoShop) and the other applications' export converts their own format to these on export.\n\nA: *\n\n*To save is to commit changes to a permanent state in a format that the application can natively utilize.\n\n*To export is to change the data format so that another application can utilize it.\nFrom webopedia.com:\n\nSave:  To copy data from a temporary area to a more permanent\n  storage medium....To record your modifications to the file on the disk, you must save the file. \n\n\n\nExport:  To format data in such a way that it can be used by\n  another application. An application that can export data can create a\n  file in a format that another application understands, enabling the\n  two programs to share the same data.\n\n\nA: Saving means to keep a file record by saving the documents with a file name in a given particular file extension whereas exporting file somewhat refers to transportation of a file from a location to some another location like from your pc to some other pc.\n", "Q: Is there any way to run PowerPC applications on Mountain Lion (Not installing-just opening from a CD) I have old software (will run from a CD) in both a Mac OSX (10.5.8) and Mac OS9 version which I would like to run on Mt Lion, MacBook Pro 2012. A very similar question has been asked and answered here, my question differs in that the software is on a CD and is run from the CD, local installation is not required. Does this change the answers that can be found at link below, addressing installation of the old software on the same machine running Mt Lion. Thanks for any feed back.\nSee Is there a way to install and use PowerPC applications on Intel Macs?\n\nA: Quick answer: No.\nLong answer: Yes, you can. You can run Snow Leopard in a VM (virtual machine) on your computer.\nThere are paid solutions like Parallels Desktop and VMWare, but a great free solution is VirtualBox. There is a fabulous guide on how to install Mac OS X Snow Leopard here\nNote: You will need a version of Mac OS X Snow Leopard to install on the Virtual Machine. If you don't own it, Apple is still selling it here.\n\nA: only way i know is to use boot camp but that takes a hell lot of work \n", "Q: Connecting external display turns both screens black I updated from 10.8.1 to 10.8.2 for my MacBook Pro Retina with my external 27\" Thunderbolt display. When I connect to my Thunderbolt display both screens are black. I can only see my mouse pointer and sometimes little boxes of display. Any idea what's wrong?\n\nA: The solution explained in this Apple Discussions thread worked for me.\n\n\n*\n\n*Delete /Library/Preferences/com.apple.windowserver.plist.\n\n*Delete ~/Library/Preferences/ByHost/com.apple.windowserver.XXXXX.plist.\n\n*Reset NVRAM.\n\n", "Q: kextstat-Listed Files Not Present in Extensions Folder I used \"kextstat | grep -v com.apple\" to find active extensions, and found the following listed extensions.\n  119    3 0xffffff7f826c7000 0x3e000    0x3e000    org.virtualbox.kext.VBoxDrv (3.2.4) <7 5 4 3 1>\n  121    0 0xffffff7f8196c000 0x8000     0x8000     org.virtualbox.kext.VBoxUSB (3.2.4) <119 35 28 7 5 4 3 1>\n\nI want to unload them with kextunload in order to reduce kernel memory usage, but there are not any org.virtualbox.kext.* files present in my /System/Library/Extensions/ directory.

I would like to connect my Dell monitor (which has a gauntlet of inputs, most notably HDMI and DVI, but not DisplayPort or Thunderbolt) into my Thunderbolt display so that I don't have to plug two monitors into my laptop every time I sit down.\nI have a VGA to Thunderbolt adapter, however when I plug the Dell into the Thunderbolt display the MBP doesn't detect the monitor. I'm willing to buy another adapter for DVI or HDMI but I need to know it will work first.\nNote that plugging in the Dell via HDMI directly into the MBP, or via the VGA adapter to the MBP works fine, however it is very inconvenient. \nIs there a solution that I can chain my Dell monitor into my Thunderbolt display? \n\nA: The Thunderbolt Display can't daisy chain other non-Thunderbolt Displays. Per Apple Support article HT5219:\n\nCan I connect a Mini DisplayPort display to my Apple Thunderbolt Display for computers that support using more than one display?\nMini DisplayPort displays will not function if connected to the Thunderbolt port of an Apple Thunderbolt Display. Displays connected via Mini DisplayPort video adapter or cable to the Thunderbolt port of an Apple Thunderbolt Display will not work.\n\nYou'll have to connect the second display to the second Thunderbolt port (or HDMI port) on your rMBP.\n", "Q: iTunes media quality and DRM? Finally iTunes Store has come to Russia so I have multiple questions that I can't find the answers actual in Q4 2012 and I pretty new to some special Apple services.\n\n\n*\n\n*Which quality have media downloaded from iTunes in comparison with MP3 CBR 320 kBit/s and 1080p videos? Are there more than 2 channels?\n\n*Can I listen to the music bought in iTunes on other devices as Android/WP phones or Cowon players (or even third-party Mac OS X players as Clementine) without any transcodings? In other words, is there DRM?\n\n*They say you just buying the right to use the media, not the media itself. What does it mean in regular use? Just that fact that I can't give them even to my relatives?\n\n*If I lost my HDD (because of reasons) how hard it be to redownload bought media?\n\n*What does iTunes Match offer me in comparison to regular iTunes Store?\n\n\nThanks in advance for the detail answers!\n\nA: *\n\n*iTunes music is encoded as 256k AAC (M4A), which should be comparable to a 320k MP3.\n\n*The iTunes Store no longer uses DRM for music, so anything you buy can be played on any device that supports AAC.\n\n*Basically, yes – there may not be DRM, but that doesn't mean you're allowed to share purchases.\n\n*(and 5.) iTunes Match lets you upload all of your music to the cloud so you can stream it from (and download it to) any of your devices. Basically, it scans your local library and if the iTunes Store has a track that matches one of your local tracks – no matter where you got the original from – you'll get access to iTunes' version of it (which could even be higher quality!). iTunes Match costs $25/year, but the music doesn't disappear if you stop paying (since there's no DRM), so you could pay for it once, download everything, and then let the subscription expire (but then obviously you couldn't match any tracks you add after that point). Note that without iTunes Match, you can still stream/download any songs you purchased from the iTunes Store for free.\n", "Q: iMac sleeping even when set to never sleep Running 10.7.5, I've got a fairly new iMac (6 months old) 27\", set to never sleep, yet when I got in to work this morning it was asleep.

Suppose I have 2 computers attached to the wireless network in my house, one a Mac and one a PC.  Suppose I want to continuously sync a folder on the Mac with a folder on the PC.  What options do I have?\nMy first thought would be to use something like Dropbox, but in this case I don't want the files to leave my network and go to the cloud.\nEdit: NAS not available here, nor is an external drive.  Just the 2 computers.\n\nA: Dropbox does have an option called LAN sync, which syncs files between computers on a LAN directly. However this still also syncs them to the cloud, it just saves you some internet bandwidth.\nAs @woz suggested, a file share on either computer or a NAS (including Time Capsule) would do the job. You could also run rsync from a cronjob, or use GoodSync, which has a neat GUI for that.\n\nA: The closest thing I have found is Cubby.  It's a Dropbox competitor, but it has a feature known as DirectSync that allows you to sync one or more folders across computers (Mac or PC) without uploading them to Cubby's cloud.  \nThe downside?  From Cubby's FAQ: \"Cubby always sets up direct UDP connections between clients unless your firewall or NAT configuration prevents it from doing so, in which case data is relayed through our data centers using a TCP based, E2E secure SSL tunnel.\"  IOW, it might run through their servers, which means it's not a perfect solution for my situation.  Still, it's close.\n", "Q: Lauchd - Run task multiple times between time interval I want to run a script every 15 minutes between 12:00 AM and 4:00 AM.  Is there a way to do that with launchd?\nI know you can specify and array of dictionaries using StartCalendarInterval to accomplish this, but I would like to easily be able to change the interval if I so desire.  I was thinking something along the lines of combining StartCalendarInterval with StartInterval, but I don't know how I would specify a stopping time.\nThe other alternative is to check the time in my script I'm running, but once again, I think I'd rather use launchd to accomplish the task in case I want to add more scripts.\nI'm pretty sure this can be done with cron as well (We could put it here for reference if anyone knows how), but I want to stick with launchd since Apple seems to be phasing out cron.\n\nA: You can print the StartCalendarInterval dictionaries with something like this: for h in {0..4}; do for m in {0,15,30,45}; do echo \"<dict><key>Hour</key><integer>$h</integer><key>Minute</key><integer>$m</integer><key>Second</key><integer>0</integer></dict>\"; done; done.\nYou could also run the script every 15 minutes but exit it depending on the time:\nh=$(date +%-H)\nm=$(date +%-M)\n[[ $h -gt 4 || $h -eq 4 && $m -ne 0 ]] && exit\n\nOr run EDITOR=nano crontab -e and add a line like */15 0-4 * * * ~/bin/script.\n", "Q: How can I rename a Logical Volume Group? I have noticed that while I can safely change the name of the Logical Volume (LM Volume) in /Volumes (currently: Apple SSD), I cannot find a way to change the name of the Logical Volume Group (currently: Crucial M4 SSD).\nThe latter is a legacy from my previous Macbook Pro's hard drive. Can I change this name?\n\n\n\nA: I renamed the \"Logical Volume Group\" on all of my drives using Disk Utility\n(OS X 10.8.5) \nNOTE: The LVG will only be renamed when the drive is erased with encryption.\n          DO NOT use \"Case Sensitive\" it is not recommended by Apple and others.  \n\n\n*\n\n*Using Disk Utility, erase the drive without encryption.\n\n*Using Disk Utility, erase the drive a second time, with encryption, giving it the name you want it to have. The drive and the volume will have the same name.\n\n\nA: If you have Yosemite installed, diskutil now includes the option to rename a Core Storage logical volume group (LVG) from the command line:\n$ diskutil cs rename\nUsage:  diskutil coreStorage rename lvgUUID|lvgName newName\nRename a CoreStorage logical volume group. Do not confuse this with LV names.\nOwnership of the affected disks is required.\n\nSo use diskutil cs list to get a list of your Core Storage volumes, then diskutil cs rename \"Crucial M4 SSD\" newVolumeGroupName to rename the LVG.  \nI haven't tested this on a mounted volume, so I don't know if you can do it without unmounting the volume. That may mean that you need to boot off an external disk with Yosemite installed in order to rename the LVG.\n\nA: You can change the name, but doing so requires that you wipe the entire drive. If you're happy to do that, and with the disclaimer that this is scary stuff, then:\n\n\n*\n\n*Right click the drive in Finder and Eject it.\n\n*Open Terminal\n\n\n*\n\n*Type diskutil list and find the identifier for the GUID_partition_scheme of the disk you want to wipe.\n\n*Type sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/INDENTIFIER bs=1024 count=1024, replacing IDENTIFIER with the identifier of the disk you want to wipe. Do not get the identifier wrong.\n\n\n*Open Disk Utility\n\n\n*\n\n*You will see the newly formatted disk, now with its factory supplied name rather than the out of date name that was bothering you.\n\n*If you wish to further replace this with a specific name of your choosing:\n\n\n*\n\n*Select the disk and click the 'Erase' tab.\n\n*Choose 'Mac OS Extended (Journaled, Encrypted)'. [OSX only renames the Logical Volume Group if you encrypt the drive. If you don't want to encrypt the drive, then just keep the factory name.]\n\n*Type your desired name into the 'Name' box and click 'Erase...'.\n\n*The logical volume group and the first disk partition will now have identical names. If you then wish to rename the disk partition, you can do so easily by simply selecting the disk in Finder, hitting Ctrl-I and updating its name in the pop-up dialog.\n\n\n\n", "Q: Safari 6's show/reveal in Finder stopped working The other day Safari 6's \"Show/Reveal in Finder\" command in the downloads window suddenly stopped working. Whether right-clicking or clicking the magnifying glass/loupe button, I can't get the Finder to jump immediately to the file in question. Double-clicking to open the file works, but I don't want to do that immediately with all my downloads.\nWhat can be done about this?\n\nA: It's caused by the Apple Events bug in 10.8. It also affects other applications and makes Archive Utility stop responding when extracting archives.\nAs a workaround, you can terminate the appleeventsd process from Activity Monitor or by running sudo killall -kill appleeventsd (without -kill the process is sent a TERM signal, which makes other processes stop responding).\n", "Q: How can I stop autocorrect in a granular way? I misspell \"maintenance\" all the time. I usually ignore the autocorrect suggestion and just send it. Recently my iPhone (and iPad and MacBook - thanks iCloud) have started suggesting the misspelling of this word as a correction. \nIt's one thing for me to ignore an error, but it's another for it to suggest the error as a correction later on. How do I change this behavior? I don't want to turn off autocorrect, I just want to remove this misspelling from the autocorrect suggestions. It also doesn't appear in \"shortcuts\" in keyboard settings, since it was never defined as a shortcut.\n\nA: When you type something several times and ignore the suggestion, iOS assumes you mean to type it that way and adds the word to the Keyboard Dictionary. You can reset the dictionary by going to Settings > General > Reset and tapping \"Reset Keyboard Dictionary\". You cannot reset the dictionary in a granular way.\nA possible workaround, however, if you don't want to reset the whole dictionary, is to add the misspelling as a shortcut and set the replacement phrase as the word spelled correctly. To do this go to Settings > General > Keyboard.\n", "Q: Why does Xcode still show up as an available update in App Store after being installed? \nI have installed the update shown from the App Store. I have since started and used XCode. Why does this update still show up in the updates list for App Store?\nIs there some extra action I need to take to complete the update? \nLink to screenshot: http://d.pr/i/dp3z\n\nA: Was having the same problem after installing Xcode v4.6 on a system with Mountain Lion, had Xcode v4.5.2 & v4.4.1 (with different names) also installed in the Applications directory. Read on a different thread that Spotlight indices can sometimes cause problems, followed the steps outlined here:\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/ht2409\nThis fixed my problem. (YMMV)\n\nA: For me this was because I had 2 different versions of xcode one in /Applications and another in /Developer/Applications\nif you copy the current version from /Applications into /Developer/Applications overwriting the old version that's there, it should disappear from the updates section when you restart the App Store.\nI believe this issue was caused by upgrading from Snow Leopard to Lion.\n", "Q: iOS music replacement apps for iTunes match and dock connector for car radio My holy grail right now is an iOS music app that meets these two criteria\n\n\n*\n\n*Supports iTunes Match\n\n*Works with my car's Made for iPod radio\n\n\nCurrently, I am using \"Track 8\", which supports iTunes Match but doesn't play nice with my car's radio.

I have a ton of songs that I classify in named playlists, and would like to have an easier way of knowing if a song has been previously classified or not. The thought occurred to me to make a Smart Playlist that will show me songs that meet the following requirements:\n\n\n*\n\n*Media Type must be Music (excludes Music Videos, Movies, TV Shows, Books, Podcasts, etc.)\n\n*Must not exist in any playlist within the parent Classification folder.\n\n*Must not exist in the \"Unclassifiable\" folder.\n\n\nI can't get the Smart Playlist to populate with all remaining songs:\n\nIs it possible to create a Smart Playlist showing all songs not in another playlist?\n\nA: It turns out that the screenshot, or at least the correct version, is sufficient:\n\nNo doubt in part to my tens of thousands of songs, and only a few hundreds currently classified, the playlist took sometime to populate.

When no music is playing and when a song in album view is selected, how can I quickly play this song, but only this song, and not the following songs in the album?\nI found out you could use Up Next via the context menu (right click), but that takes two mouse clicks and after that you manually need to press play to start playing. Is there a faster way to do this (preferably using a shortcut)?\n\nA: One option would be to save this script to ~/Library/Scripts/Applications/iTunes/ in AppleScript Editor and give it a shortcut with FastScripts.\ntry\n    tell application \"iTunes\"\n        play item 1 of selection with once\n    end tell\nend try\n\nWithout the try block there would be an error dialog if for example the selection was empty.\n", "Q: Retina display resolution and 1080p videos There is something I don't understand.\nI have a macbook pro 15' retina display.\nThe information says it has a 2880 x 1800 display but when I open a 1080p video it covers the whole screen. How come? \n\nA: This was probably done so that videos, especially those that are lower resolution than 1080p, don't look absurdly small. If you want to play your video at the native resolution on your screen, (and you've selected \"best for retina\" as your display resolution), you could always tell VLC to play it back at half the size.\n\nA: Make sure that you're using an up-to-date version of VLC. Retina support was only introduced in version 2.0.2. If you're running a prior version, it may end up pixel-doubled.\nIf you do have an up-to-date version, make sure that the video window hasn't just been scaled up. You can resize it to normal dimensions by clicking Normal Size in the Video menu, or pressing ⌘1.\n", "Q: How do I prevent my iMac from sleeping while media is being played or streamed? I know this problem has been around for a while. With the release of Mountain Lion Macs got the bad habit of falling to sleep when they are not used by a human.\nMy iMac falls to sleep when I walk away for a while. Even when the system should be busy with downloading files and converting videos. It just goes to sleep no matter what.\nWith an Apple TV its even worse. I got used to restarting iTunes before I started watching a movie to reset the connection but with the release of iTunes 11 the Mac even falls to sleep while I am already watching the movie! I have wake on lan activated like the Apple support side say but it just doesn't matter.\nSometimes I use the Caffein App to keep my Mac awake but most of the time I forget to do so and Apple TV just cuts the connection when the Mac went to sleep again.\nIs there any permanent solution for the kind of bad behavior?\n\nA: I experienced exactly the same issue. The steps to resolve the issue were the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*delete /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/com.apple.PowerManagement.plist\n\n*reboot\n\n\nIf it won't solve it another helpful step could be resetting the SMC: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3964?viewlocale=en_US\n\nA: For the general case, the easiest thing to do is not let your computer sleep. Go to Energy Saver in System Preferences and move the \"Computer sleep\" slider to \"Never\". If that's too extreme, you could move the slider to 3 hours which will keep your computer doing whatever it's doing for at least 3 hours after you leave it.\nEither way, you can still let the display sleep to save power and the computer will look like it's sleeping.\nSpecific to AppleTV streaming, there appears to be a bug in iTunes 11. Here's an Open Radar bug report: http://openradar.appspot.com/12791690.\nUpdate 2012-12-13: iTunes 11.0.1 just came out and the missing power assertion has returned. This should fix the AppleTV streaming problem.\n\nA: Set your Mac's 'Energy Saver' Preferences setting to 'Wake on Network Access'. \nRead about it here:\nhttp://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201960\n\nA: Go to Settings --> Mission Control. Set up a hot corner to disable the screen saver.

How can I achieve this?\n\nA: If you are using macOS, you can create a new Service with Automator, add a Run AppleScript action to it, and enter the following script:\nset current_application to (path to frontmost application as Unicode text)\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    if process \"iTunes\" exists then\n        tell application \"iTunes\"\n            set current_volume to the sound volume\n            if (player state is playing) then\n                repeat\n                    repeat with i from current_volume to 0 by -1\n                        set the sound volume to i\n                        delay 0.01\n                    end repeat\n                    pause\n                    set the sound volume to current_volume\n                    exit repeat\n                end repeat\n            else\n                set the sound volume to 0\n                play\n                repeat with j from 0 to current_volume by 1\n                    set the sound volume to j\n                end repeat\n            end if\n        end tell\n        tell application current_application\n            activate\n        end tell\n    end if\nend tell\n\nYou can assign a keyboard shortcut to it in System Preferences > Keyboard > Keyboard Shortcuts > Services.\n\nA: For Mac OS X v10.5 or later (Intel 32/64 bits), you can use this script, Im using this for fade out/in music when I pause or play my music, or skipping songs, its great and works fine with the built in crossfade from playback menu.its great for party play list and works just fine with the latest version of itunes (12.1.2) \nhttp://www.wildbits.com/accubeatmix/\n\nA: The script above faded out too fast for my taste so I modified it slightly (the 3 modified/added lines are in uppercase - is it possible to highlight text in a code section with e.g., bold? - just change them to lower case if you use it).

Can I maintain it from a (not jailbroken) iPad 3? I have a website at JonathansCorner.com, which for the most part is a static collection of files, mostly HTML5, served up by a Linux Apache server. Maintaining it is mostly a matter of creating new HTML5 files and of updating existing files on my computer, used partly as a staging site, before being sftp'ed over to the server. Technologically the site is not particularly interesting; it's the content if anything that draws people.\nMoving from maintaining my website on a Linux server to keeping it on a Mac was a piece of cake; Mac is my favorite Unix.\nBut I wanted to ask: Can I maintain, expand, and update my website on any iPad that has not been jailbroken? I recognize that the wrong way to go about the problem would be to go to search for the closest the App store has for my favorite editor, and for providing or emulating a heirarchy of files, and then sftp over. That may not be possible even on a jailbroken iPad, and it has the character of what woodenly word-for-word renderings are criticized for in translations that try to preserve the Greek word order or what have you as far as possible without pointedly breaking English grammar. What I have outlined may be appropriate on a Mac, but if the question is \"How can I best use an iPad,\" it's barking up the wrong fire hydrant.\nWhat I did want to ask is whether there is some dynamic equivalent that would be possible on the iPad. At very least the iPad should have multiple good options for composing something you're writing and emailing it to someone, perhaps to yourself. And composing in a nice editor and then converting plain text to HTML is a significant offering, or the pedestrian route of making a webmin interface to my site and try to optimize it for my iPad, and I imagine something like these might constitute the best way afforded by my iPad to pursue this interest, but maybe something better is available.\nWhat are the best iPad offerings to facilitate \"Compose it with your iPad and then post it as a handcoded webpage?\" (What would you do if you wanted to use an iPad to expand and maintain a website consisting of an extensive collection of HTML documents and other static content, such as JonathansCorner.com?\n\nA: Sounds like Diet Coda would be right up your alley. It's an iPad rethinking of the highly regarded Mac App Coda.\n\nBasically it's everything you need to do hand coding of websites in one app package — a text editor for coding, (S)FTP for file management, and SSH for any server-side tasks. That's a pretty bare-bones description, there are a lot of well polished details that you may appreciate, I suggest checking out the site for more information.\nYou may also be interested in reviews from Macworld and Macstories.\nBackups\nIt's worth noting that Diet Coda doesn't store the site resources on your iPad (it may cache some for performance reasons, but no permanent storage), all editing is done directly on the server. For this reason, it's probably best to have a backup of your website stored elsewhere if you don't already. This could be your Mac, but you could keep it all online by using something like Amazon S3. From the looks of your site (it appears to be just HTML and images, no big downloads, etc.), you could almost certainly keep a backup there for just over a dollar per year. It would be easy enough to set up an rsync script to automatically back up your site on a regular schedule to S3, and even keep snapshotted versions, you wouldn't really have to do anything beyond the initial set up.\n\nA: A cheaper alternative which I use is Gusto.\nFEATURES:\n\n\n*\n\n*Project-Driven Workflow\n\n*Syntax Highlighting for all major web languages\n\n*Themed Syntax Highlighting\n\n*Tabbed Editor\n\n*Line Numbering\n\n*Hard and Soft Line Breaks\n\n*Mono-spaced Font\n\n*Built-in File Transfer Client supports FTP, SFTP, FTPS, and Dropbox\n\n*Toolbar for Frequently Used Keys\n\n*One-Button Document Publishing\n\n*Built-in Local and Remote Site Previews\n\n*Project State is Autosaved\n\n", "Q: How to share iOS Pages document that was created on Mac? I recently created a Pages document on my Mac (OS X 10.8.2). I then opened it in Pages on my iPhone (iOS 6.1) to email it to someone. iCloud downloaded the document as expected when I opened Pages, but when I tapped the Edit button, and selected the document, the \"Share\" icon was greyed out. The \"Duplicate\", and \"Delete\", icons work as expected. I also tried duplicating the document before sharing it, with no success.\nIs it possible to share Pages documents that were created on a Mac and synced over iCloud from an iOS device?\n\nA: You can share a pages document from your iPhone. Instead of clicking \"Edit\", then the share icon, try clicking the document itself, and opening it. Once you have opened the document on your iPhone, click the spanner icon in the top right. A list of options will appear. Click the one that says \"Share and Print\". Now click \"Email Document\". You will be given an opportunity to choose whether to email a Pages, PDF, or Word document. After selecting the appropriate option, an email window will appear, with the document as an attachment.\n", "Q: iTunes 11 does not record Play Counts anymore? I was playing an album the other day and noticed that none of the songs being played are incrementing their play count. I am running iTunes 11.0 and would like play counts to work like before. \nWhat is happening and can I fix this?\n\nA: According to some articles I've read on the net, it's a design flaw by Apple - disabling crossfade will make the playcount start to work again.\n\nA: I think it's a universal glitch that's occurring with the new iTunes update they just had, seeing that this problem only showed up after the update. \n", "Q: iBooks - is there a way to organize bookmarks by page number? Over the last year, I've replaced (and expanded) my library of programming books from physical copies to ebooks.  In each book, I have a host of bookmarks.  Unfortunately, I didn't save them in one front-to-back read through so my bookmark lists are all out of page order.  Is there a way to sort/organize them by page number?\n\nA: Short Answer:\nThere is simply no way to do this as of iOS 6 and iBooks 3.x.\nLong Answer:\nApple is amazingly quiet about bookmarks in iBooks - other then mentioning that it is possible. If you follow this link to the iBook FAQ, click \"iBook Features\", then \"Can I bookmark and save my page?\", you will notice that they mention it is possible to bookmark pages, but don't even mention how to view the bookmarks - let alone an alternate way to sort them. About the only other iBook information page I could find was this with no information that was pertinent to you.\nOn the other hand, the Kindle iOS app seems to prefer ordering bookmarks by page number instead of date. It might be painstaking, and I'm not even sure it would transfer you bookmarks over (in which case it would be worthless), but I do know it is possible to email books and PDFs to Kindle for reading (see \"Read Personal Documents:\" in the above link). It may be possible to sync the books to your computer, and then email them over.\nHonestly, what you're asking for doesn't seem to be a very popular request, so it may be a very long time - if ever - before Apple releases such a feature.\nI also tried searching for a variety of general terms to see if it would pull up a list of bookmarks - in page order, but even that failed.\n", "Q: Can't find Excel 2011 Auto-recovered spreadsheet Yesterday morning my colleagues Excel 2011 (on Mac OSX 10.8) crashed.

I like it mostly, although as I'm developing sites locally, when I type in a local address such as site.local it searches Google for site.local, \nI'm wondering if I can config it to look at the local DNS first, or turn this search off.\n\nA: Something else to try: add a forward slash at the end of the URL (so instead, type site.local/).\nI do this at work sometimes when trying to access intranet sites. It usually forces the browser to load that resource rather than search. Has worked for me in Chrome and Firefox too.\n\nA: Here are a couple of things to try:\n1. Start typing in the Smart Search Field. In the dropdown menu which appears, there should be a Go to Site option.\n\n(Image from Apple Support Communities).\n2. Try Matt Swain's AnySearch Safari Extension.\n\nAnySearch allows you to use any custom search engine you want - not just the three that Safari allows by default.

Unfortunately, the Maltese langauge is not listed with the default European languages on iOS devices. What can I do?\n\nA: I don't know for sure whether the extra characters required for Maltese (ċġħż) might all be available in the layout for another language or not.  It would be kind of tedious to check.  But there are a couple apps, Unicode Map and UniKey, which let you create a sort of custom keyboard layout using any Unicode characters which can be used for copy/paste, etc.\nYou should also search the app store on Maltese to see if anyone has created a keyboard for that for copy/paste or email, etc.  I see there is an app called 1Hand Mail/SMS Maltese Keyboard that may be useful.\n\nA: I have just released an app that gives you a Maltese Keyboard on iOS devices :)\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/mt/app/maltese-keyboard/id940508915?mt=8\n\nA: From a lobbying standpoint, http://www.apple.com/feedback is a nice place to get iOS users that would like have support added for a new localization. \nYou could suggest which settings are closest and enumerate the changes needed. Perhaps if a few people suggested what was needed, official support might be added in an update. The other answer has more practical suggestions and perhaps a jailbreak or other app might help at least to write things you could copy / paste into non Maltese aware apps that use the system keyboard.  \n", "Q: Mouse cursor goes crazy! This is driving me insane... All of a sudden my mouse cursor starts jumping and clicking around by its own. It doesn't look like somebody is remote controlling it. It rather is jumping around randomly, executing clicks or context menu commands just without any obvious aim.\nThis usually happens while I am working a while with the MacBook sitting on my lap. My feeling is that battery level could play a role here since the problem occurs only when the battery got drained down to below 50%. But it is just an impression. Could also have something to do with temperature, although I do not do CPU heavy stuff (just browsing).\nI could do nothing against it. I switched off WLAN and Bluetooth.

Switching off both doesn´t change anything.\n- It´s not in my account. Switching to another account is not the cure.\nI´m really embarrassed, but I solved the problem here.\nYesterday my mouse battery was empty and I connected an old microsoft mouse with a cord because I ran out of loaded batteries. After reloading batteries I continued using Magic Mouse. But I didn´t disconnect the cord mouse but put it into a box. And since than I had tis problem. Removing the cord mouse solved the problem.\n\nA: I went to my local mac dealer and it seems that the trackpad needs to be exchanged.\nUpdate: It was definitely a hardware problem. Since the trackpad got exchanged, everything went back to normal. Most probably liquids found their way into the pad (a drop would be enough to mess everything up).\n\nA: Some time, it happen because of humidity. you should try to sunbathe your macbook  for 15 minutes. if there is no sunlight in your country you can fix it with using hair dryer. Make sure your laptop is turned off before doing this job.\nNote: Using of hair dryer must be 1 or 2 minute only on trackpad and keyboard. \nHope! it will solve your problem. \n", "Q: iCloud and Email and syncing I am a little bit confused as to how best to setup my devices to have the best battery life and best syncing options.\nI have an iMac, iPad mini & iPhone 5.\nCurrently I use Google Apps (Gmail) to store my email, calendar and contacts. I want to use some of the other iCloud functions such as Notes and Reminders syncing.\nI figure it was best to switch everything to iCloud except my email. But that still requires me to be syncing two accounts on my iPhone and iPad (one exchange account for email and one account for iCloud) which I assume would drain the battery alot.\nIs there any way I can have this setup such that I am only syncing one account and everything is pushed to my devices and in sync?\n\nA: Yes, you can forward any email from your exchange account to icloud! \nSo you don't have to sync your exchange–emails sepperatly! \nGo to the email settings in your exchange account,there must be an option where you can forward any incoming email to another address. \nWhen you want to transfer all your old emails as well:use mail on Mac, create your two accounts and move all exchange emails to an icloud folder! \nYou can also send from your exchange-account: create your account in the settings, but disable the option to synchronise the emails. \nWhen you now want to send a new email, you have the option from which account you want to send it. \n", "Q: Is it possible to turn off the iPhone Calendar invitations badge/list? Is it possible to turn off the new invite badge and the list of new invitations within the Calendar application on the iPhone?\nMy boss has his assistant review his invitations and accept/deny them for him, so he has no need to do this from his phone.  He therefore doesn't want to see the red badge on the Calendar app icon on the home screen, or the red badge in the bottom right hand corner of the screen within the Calendar application that says he has six new invitations, and he doesn't want to see the list of new invitations upon clicking that button.\nI've recreated this on my iPhone and have screenshots available as an example (however because I'm a first time poster it won't allow me to post them).  Any help someone could provide would be appreciated.\n\nA: There are two things that you can do here.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Settings > Mail, Contacts, Calendars > Scroll down to the Calendars section (near the bottom), and change \"New Invitation Alerts\" to Off.\n\n*In the Settings app, tap Notifications > select Calendars, and then turn off Calendars notifications in Notification Center (if desired), and set the Alert style to \"None\", and, most importantly, turn \"Badge App Icon\" to Off.\n\n\nUnfortunately, to the best of my knowledge, there is no way to specifically disable the Red badge that is inside the app. However, it is possible turning off \"New Invitation Alerts\" will have that effect.\n\nA: Most of the replies so far are outdated, but there are probably some like me still interested in this.\nAs of iOS 10, this is easy. Open Settings>Notifications>Calendar. From here you can disable certain alerts, including only those for Invites.\n\nA: Actually, this functionality has been moved into the Notification settings for Calendar items (Settings > Notifications > Calendar). \nIn that view you'll have the option to change notifications for: Upcoming Events; Invitations; Invitee Responses; and Shared Calendar Changes. Each one give the ability to select: whether its shown in notification center; notification sound; badge app icon; show on lock screen; and the alert style!\n\nA: I just tested answering the invites with my phone in Airplane mode. It appears to remove the invite badge without sending a notification to the source.\nPersonally Apple should have a Dismiss option, but this method might just do the trick until they provide that option.\n\nA: Instantly clear notifications in calendar inbox, never get those again:\nCalendar > calendars\nNext to each calendar (shared/subscribed) is an “info” button. Click.\nShared Changes: turn off.  This will instantly clear the inbox.\nFYI: Below the color choices is Event Alerts: choose on/off to get notification for the upcoming events (day before, hour before, time to leave, etc), whatever alert option was initially used when event was created.\n\nA: Settings > Notifications > Calendar:  You can specify what to receive.\nHere is a pic of the choices:\n\n\nA: I've had this same issue and unfortunately there is no way to turn off the invitation count one sees on the bottom right of the calendar app. I've shut off all notifications (badges, banners, etc) for calendar and these still show up, at least until the invite is attended to in the email inbox. So if one's admin is completing invites, the counter should in theory update in the calendar app in the bottom right corner.\nMy situation is a bit unique in that my personal account is part of a family domain hosted on outlook.com (no longer offered for new signups at Microsoft) and I receive counters for invites to other \"shared\" calendars that aren't even mine (belong to spouse, child, etc). I think these calendars are being seen by the device as \"other\" calendars of mine, when in fact they are not mine. If I click \"accept\" it just reappears right back in that list of notifications in calendar. I've determined that because I don't have edit rights to those other family members' calendars, the server just rejects my \"acceptances\" and resends the invite. Endless cycle. Very annoying. Invitations to calendars shared with me should not result in those other individuals' calendar invites coming to me.\n", "Q: Can I have iTunes 11 revert to filtering by word instead of phrase? The filter/search in previous iTunes worked on a word-based matching system.  If each of the words matched anywhere in the song info (title, artist, genre, etc) then a song was returned.  It appears that the new default in iTunes 11 is for it to be a phrase-based match.\nThis breaks searching as far as I'm concerned.  For example, there's no longer any way to search by artist and genre.  If I have an artist with a bunch of different genres and I want to listen to a subset I'm not unable to do this.  Example:  \"sufjan christmas\" used to bring back all my Sufjan Stevens Christmas music.  Now it brings back nothing because nothing has the phrase \"sufjan christmas\" in it.\nIs there a way to revert to the old method of filtering?\n\nA: I was able to revert to the old functionality by clicking on the magnifying glass in the search box and unchecking \"search entire library\".  This had the side effect of speeding up the searching greatly as well as filtering in place instead of taking me to a different screen when I clicked on the search result.\n", "Q: Bug with iPhone data usage counter I know that I can see the data usage of my iPhone 4(iOS 6.0.1) under: Settings → General → Usage → Cellular, Usage , but the counter has a bug - now it's showing over 16GB(for 2-3 hours tethering). Any Idea of the reason for this bug? If I use some app for counting the data usage, would it show the right usage?\n\nA: That is probably just a bug in the data counting mechanism. You could download your carrier's app to test how much data you have really used.\nAnother thing to try would be updating your iPhone to 6.1.3. There are always some bugs fixed in each release, and maybe this is one of them. \n", "Q: Time Machine drive encryption going for 22 hours. Is it stalled? I set up Time Machine in Mountain Lion by plugging in a newly formatted 500GB USB drive, selecting that from the Time Machine dialog, and checking the box to encrypt my backups. A window appeared that said \"Preparing disk [diskname] for encryption.\" The progress bar quickly filled to about 80% and then stalled there. It's been about 22 hours now with no sign of progress. I know encrypting a drive can take a while, but is this too long? Should I force quit or unplug the drive and start over?\nNotes:\n\n\n*\n\n*I checked the system log to verify that the computer's been up and working all night; it didn't go to sleep. \n\n*The drive is no longer showing up in the finder or Disk Utility. Is that normal when encryption is in progress?\n\n\nA: 22 hours is very long indeed. I have encrypted a 1TB drive in less time before.\n\nThe encryption is handled by a \"live background process\". \"This\nprocess continues seamlessly across reboots. The logical volume\nremains usable at all times.\"\nfrom man page > diskutil > encryptVolume\n\nMaybe this daemon hangs or simply halted because the drive is not mounted (which is fine). So you should just re-mount it again.\nAlternatively, I would try I restart the daemon by simply restarting the computer. Once the Time Machine backup is mounted again, the daemon will continue encrypting the drive.\nChecking the encryption progress using diskutil\nYou can check the status of the encryption by using the command:\ndiskutil cs list\n\nIn the nested tree you will see a Logical Volume Family which is currently being encrypted.

I like the fact that sync downloads voice memos to my Macbook Pro.  But I do not like the fact iTunes includes my voice memos in my general music library.  It's a bit goofy to be listening to my music on shuffle and all of a sudden have it start playing my voice speaking!  Is there a way to prevent them from showing up there - but still have them synced?\n\nThis has been happening for as long as I've been making voice memos, and is happening in iTunes 11 also.\n\nA: I agree also that this is an inconvenience, and it is annoying. \nSome other ways you can resolve the issue is by highlighting all of you voice memos in the entire library (easy to do if you have your library sorted by genre), right click to 'get info', go to the options tabs and check the option 'skip when shuffling' and everything that is highlighted can be still checked and they will never play unless you manually select them.\nAlso under that same options tab, there's a drop-down under 'Media kind' and if you select 'audio book' instead of voice memo (or music), they will no longer appear in your main library, and will instead appear under the audio books library.\nHope this helps.\n\nA: I totally agree with you about Apple not implementing a proper place for voice memos in iTunes. They've even added a separate window for home made movies in iTunes 11's Movies section. This kind of disappointing.\nBut anyway, perhaps you already now this but one possible solution would be to uncheck syncing of voice memos in iTunes's settings for your iOS device.\n\nThis way, they won't be downloaded to your MBP so you will have to manually transfer them.\nManual transferring of voice memos might be disappointing for you but on the other hand, a smart playlist might affect your iTunes library's performance since a smart playlist keep scanning library for changes.\n\nA: I HATE Apple sometimes! They do this minimalistic structure on softwares but, in order to do so, they lose track on the real stuff needed to keep the software content really organized.\nSo, about your answer: you can right click the voice memos, select \"get info\", go to the tab \"options\" and select \"skip when shuffling\" to avoid having it played on shuffle, as someone already said.\nBut, if your deal is about the aesthetics on iTunes, having an artist on the side tab called \"voice memos\", \"iphone\" or \"ipod\" under your music, what you can really do is selecting everything undesired on this tabs, such as \"voice memos\", side click over them, select \"get info\", and them going under the tab \"options\". After that, the first option is called \"media kind\" and, instead of \"voice memos\" - which are displayed on your itunes library, you select \"podcasts\" which are not. \nHope I helped! It worked for me. But you just have to remember that all this media will be available on podcasts only.

I had a kernel panic about 2 years ago, and another one a few days ago. I haven't had any other problems besides minor software bugs, and I was able to harmlessly reboot after both. I've been told this can mean many bad hardware-related things. Could it just be something relatively harmless, since it doesn't really seem too persistent? Is it worth having it checked out?\n\nA: The first time you get a kernel panic, it is a reminder to make sure you have a regular backup system in place. Restart the Mac and check that your backup is configured. Check later that day to test restoring a files you need to be backed up. \nThe second time you get a kernel panic, decide how you're going to track when they happen. I use a 3 x 5 note card to document things like what I was doing when I noticed it in the date and time. \nOther than that, until you lose real work, the occasional panic/error isn't a real concern as much an annoyance. If you end up annoyed or have recurring panics, gather objective data needed to solve most kernel panics. Apple documents their well engineered process for this:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT200553\nOnce you have a handful of events, checking with support is good since they are in a better position to weigh if hardware is suspected to be faulty or if your panics are software in nature. \n\nA: Yes, sometimes a kernel panic can indicate bad/damaged or incompatible hardware. The frequency with which you have them is probably not indicative of a major hardware problem (i.e. bad cable connected to MotherBoard from HDD, etc.), unless you notice physical conditions that seem to coincide (i.e. hottest day of the year, child pounding on desk, etc.), or while performing the same software related task (i.e. clearing caches). It could be as simple as having one system file corrupted that is not often used.\nOn the other hand, I have also seen this caused by having hardware just lose its connection slightly (i.e. an eSata ExpressCard slipping out just a little while in use on a 17-inch MacBook Pro).\n\nA: Twice in two years is nothing. Computers run on electrical signals not 0 and 1. Yes, sometimes errors occur. 'Single-bit errors' may occur, but the hardware and your OS are smart enough to deal with them most of the time. However, sometimes, they can't and you get the kernel panic, indication of something serious went wrong, perhaps not possible to correct. Twice in 2 years doesn't necessarily mean faulty hardware, just random unlikely errors.\nIf you are so worried about, you can start inspecting your hardware. Most kernel panics I have encountered were due to bad RAM modules! Start by running a memory test and see what you get.\n\nA: There's so much conflicting and confusing advice on the web about Kernel Panics - and very often no reason to take your machine in.\nRead Apple's own support page, About Kernel Panics ,\nand MacWorld's How To Troubleshoot a Kernel Panic. You'll be able to isolate the problem and from there, know what steps to take, many of which are quite simple.\n", "Q: Can I share photos to Facebook without downloading my contacts?

The message that pops up (after it fails to log in) says, 'FaceTime Activation Could not sign in.  Please check your network connection and try again.'  This happens for iMessage, as well.  I am using the right password and email, and I do not use an iCloud account.  What should I do to be able to log in again and keep my email the same?\n\nA: I will try restoring the iPod itself. It sounds like a software issue, maybe about cache.\nThere's also another possibilities about your network routers. It might be blocking those ports or whatever. Try with an Apple one.\n\nA: reset your setting then make sure your Bluetooth is not on. This worked for me. Or just try the Bluetooth first!\n\nA: By chance do you have a cover/case on you iPod? Go into the room where your wi-fi router is and try again. If you do have a cover on it, remove it first to activate it and then if it works you should be able to place the cover back on still use it. I have a Survivor case on mine and that was blocking the signal needed to activate. It didn't get in the way of itunes, internet connection, or anything else.

I've been trying to save up space and for this reason I'm using the \"don't keep copies of any messages\" option.\nI was thinking though, can I instead choose to save all emails and attachments, but an external hard drive? I'd like the best of both options: when hard drive is not connected it behaves exactly as \"don't keep copies of any messages\", when connected it has the possibility to search all mail.\nApple seem to want me not to find where mail is stored, and does not have an option in the preferences to do what I want (that I'm aware of).\nAny suggestions?\n\nA: The answer by Zo219 is nice for having two copies, but my solution is to link the folders where Mail wants to store the files to the external drive and not have two copies.\nHere are the folders you'll need to have located off the main drive:\n\n\n*\n\n*~/Library/Mail\n\n*~/Library/Containers/com.apple.mail/Data/Library/ \n\n\nSince the volumes are separate, you can't hard link and instead need to soft (sum) link the folders or use Finder's alias function once you've moved these folders to your second drive.\n\nThat is one way that works, but I think he wants something more seamless like a remapping of the Mail directory (~/Library/Mail) to a live clone on the external drive.  I've a relative small SSD on my air (128GB) so had used a simple alias to relocate my Mail library to an external HDD at my desk.  I used an alternate user \"mobile\" so I could check email Mail with ease when I was away from the home office.  This recently broke under my current version of Mountain Lion (10.8.2) and I am currently looking at a workaround.  To my knowledge, hard-linking under recent versions OS X is not for the faint of heart, as it may create difficulties with Time Machine et al.  Let me know in the comments if my solution is confusing.  As far as your concern about behaviour when the external drive is not connected and you launch Mail, it just quietly fails with a polite error message about no access to an unmounted target.\n\nA: Keeping copies of your mail or anything else on your computer on an external hard drive is trivial, and why Apple has decided to make things  difficult, to hide what was once common knowledge is, ironically, part of their effort to make things easy. \nIf the User Library is set to invisible, then Apple figures beginners can't go to ~/Library/Mail/ and delete all their mail, and Apple will get fewer support calls. \nYour Mail folders are in there, and are yours to drag and drop, copy and paste, use a backup or clone app--whatever--to the location of your choice.\nAnd everything is searchable--every last item, on your machine and externals--with the free EasyFind by DevonTech.  \n\nA: I use Symbolic Links. This can be done from the command line or else fram a contextual item in Finder\nOne program that adds this contextual item can downloaded from here Follow the instructions in the download in order to install it. \nFirst of all copy your mail to the external location.  You'll need to copy both the Mail and Mail Downloads folders which are located in ~/Library  If you cannot get to that folder, in the Finder, click on the Go menu, and then Go to Folder.  Then type ~/Library and hit Enter to open the folder and copy the folders.  Once you have copied the folders, verify that the Mail Application is completely closed.  Delete the Mail and Mail Downloads folders from the ~/Library folder.  Now right click on the Mail and Mail Downloads folders in your external drive, Select Services, and then make Symbolic Links for them.  Move the Symbolic Links you just created (they look like aliased folders) into ~/Library.  Now rename them to be Mail and Mail Downloads.  That's it!\nIt's important to note that if you try running the Mail Application without your external drive, you'll need to repeat all this, because without the external drive, the Mail Application will try to recreate empty Mail and Mail Downloads folders, and it may also reset your accounts in Mail. \nI can confirm that this is working with 10.8.3\n", "Q: Should I be concerned that the fan on my 11 inch Air makes a lot of noise when I play Call of Duty Black Ops?

The fan spins quite loudly and the machine gets hotter while I play, even for a short duration. Should I be worried that playing the game for a long time would do some physical damage to the processor core and/or do some other harm to the hardwire?\n\nA: No, it will shut itself down in the fairly unlikely event that it gets hot enough to risk causing damage. It's designed to run hot with the fan at high speed when it's under high CPU load.\n", "Q: Mountain Lion - scale down the window shadows it is just me or did apple increased the size of the window shadows in mountain lion way to much?\nThis is annoying when you've 2 windows side by side - is there any way to turn them off / to scale them down?\n\nA: The program I use to do this on OS X 10.8.4 is ShadowSweeper.\nhttp://download.cnet.com/ShadowSweeper/3000-2072_4-75966596.html\nThis one looks like it might also work but I haven't tried it myself.\nhttps://github.com/puffnfresh/toggle-osx-shadows\nOthers have suggested the programs ShadowKiller and Nocturne.

I did however find an article showing how you can do so on your mac, it could be worth a try.\n\nAfter opening Contacts, go to the app’s preferences pane. Navigate to\n  the “Accounts” section:\n  http://ismh.s3.amazonaws.com/2012-12-16-google-contacts-1.png\n  Hit the plus sign to add an account. Here are the required settings:\n  Account type: CardDAV:\n  Username: Your Gmail Account\n  Your password\n  Server address: google.com\nHit the “Create” button:\n  http://ismh.s3.amazonaws.com/2012-12-16-google-contacts-2.png\n  Contacts.app will then ask if you want use these credentials for other\n  types of information. Select what you wish and press the “Create”\n  button again.\nOnce the account is listed in Contact.app’s preferences, go to the\n  “General” section and set your Google account to be the default\n  account:\n  http://ismh.s3.amazonaws.com/2012-12-16-google-contacts-3.png\nBy default, the application defaults to saving vCards locally on the\n  Mac, which means information added from other programs won’t end up in\n  the Google cloud.\n\n\nA: Yes. I use it on Mountain Lion.\nDetails here:http://tech.kateva.org/2013/02/google-contact-sync-on-mountain-lion.html.\nIt's not clear to me how Contacts.app is merging Google/iCloud duplicates that arise if you use iCloud, or handling editing of those duplicates. There's no support for Google Group/Tag relationships or Mac Group/Tag relationships.\nNobody has gotten it working on Snow Leopard, though if you want to try that (do publish) Hsiaoi's technique is a good start (http://www.hsiaoi.com/blog/?p=512). I suspect SSL is a problem.\nI believe it also works on Lion but I've not tested.\n\nA: The Accounts tab of the Contacts preferences give you an option to add a CardDAV acount:\n\nSimply use that. If that doesn't work for you, please post a more specific problem description.\n", "Q: Strange lines and glitches appearing on screen on a Macbook Lately I've been witnessing this weird visual glitch on the screen of my MacBook (non-retina 2012, hi-res screen):\n\nI have had to take a picture of it because whenever I try to take a screenshot it goes away right before the screenshot is taken.\nI thought this glitch only happened when I had Adobe Illustrator open, which is when I would see it appear more often, but I've now also caught it in situations where the application was not running (the picture above is one of those cases).\nI cannot pinpoint the exact cause of this and I cannot tell whether it's a hardware or a software issue, but I can only say it's not one of those flickering effects that appear for a second and then vanish. This is actually very persistent and will only go away when I switch to another application or in some way move the current window.\nDoes anybody know what this is and what might cause it?\nHere are more pictures:\n\n\n\n\nA: Well, it looks like you may need a visit to the nearest Apple Store,\nbut first try downloading SMCFanControl: http://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/23049/smcfancontrol and try turning up the fan speed to cool the overheated graphics card and see if that helps.\nPlease note that I am not sure whether the fan speed on the MacBook is adjustable, but it's certainly worth a try.\n\nA: I've fixed my problem completely.\nI was using 2x4gb 1333mhz ram on my late 2008 macbook pro.\nScreen blinked only when using the integrated 9400m. Mountain Lion would just kernel panic and crash. Gave up and was using 9600gt all the time.\nThe problem was the ram, it was NOT faulty but the machine says it needs 1066mhz ram and the out of spec 1333mhz caused the integrated 9400m to overclock itself.\nI recently bought new memory and the machine has been rock solid. No more screen blinks as all.\nThe old memory is just fine running on my hp laptop now.\n\nA: I have had screen glitch happen to me, I find the solution to this is to press down on the screen arm so it sits harder against the hinge.  I think it may be a loose connection in the hinge because my screen glitches like crazy and when I put downward pressure on the top of the screen it will go away right away.  Try it?\n", "Q: Stop iMessages from coming to my Mac When I send messages from my iPhone (A) to another iPhone (B), the responses from B keep coming to my Mac and do not appear on my phone (A), even when I have iMessages closed. This is maddening. How can I prevent this from happening?\n\nA: You have a couple of ways to configure this. First off, make sure both the computer and iPhone have been set up to use the same Apple ID.  \n\n\n*\n\n*You can disable Messages.app's ability to receive text messages on your Mac: \n\n\n*\n\n*Open the Messages application. Access your preferences by going to the menubar and clicking Messages -> Preferences... \n\n*Under the \"Accounts\" tab, you will see all the accounts you've set up to use with Messages, including iCloud. Selecting \"iCloud\" from the options on the left side of that screen will show the email addresses you specified and your phone number. \n\n*Unchecking these will disable the ability of Messages.app to receive those messages you wish to send only between mobile devices.  \n\n\n*On your iPhone:\n\n\n*\n\n*Tap \"Settings\", then scroll down to \"Messages\" and tap it. \n\n*Scroll down to \"Send and Receive\" and tap it. Look for the menu option heading that says \"You can be reached by iMessage at:\", which has your phone number (checked by default) and the email account you configured when you initially set up your iPhone. This is probably your apple ID, but can be any other email address you've specified. \n\n*Simply tap the email addresses that are checked to disable them. This should force messages to communicate with only your phone number. \n\n\n\nIt should work by disabling all but your phone number on iMessage, but you may need to disable everything on your Mac as well. A little experimentation and tweaking should get you set in just a couple of minutes. \nGood luck!\n\nA: The best thing to do is just reset your setting and sign out of iCloud on your computer. once it's done reseting on your phone, sign back in on your Mac and every thing should be fine.\n\nA: You can also sign out in Messages on your Mac.  Under Preferences, then click Accounts and click the Sign Out button.  Then you will no longer receive messages on your Mac.\n", "Q: What's the horizontal sync and vertical refresh values for the June 2012 MBP 13\" display? Got the June 2012 13\" base MBP, and wondering if anyone knew (or how to find out) the horizontal sync and vertical refresh values for this display? \nI'm trying to set up the correct resolution for the Linux Mint partition, and I've found with other installations (on other hardware) that having the incorrect hsync and vert refresh values will prevent the OS from listing all the available resolution options.\nI rang and asked Apple Support but they weren't able to assist in this matter, but suggested that there might be a command to query the hardware directly.\nedit: I tried the command listed at this question but it seemed to produce no output, and returned immediately.\n\nA: I was able to get these values by booting into the Linux partition (which somehow managed to get the correct resolution by itself!) and using the following cmd in terminal (requires super):\nget-edid | parse-edid\n\nI was expecting a range of values, e.g. 60.0 - 75.0, but got the exact values - vfreq 60.223Hz and hfreq 50.949Hz.\nThis should be available via a live-CD/usb too.\n", "Q: Fullscreen apps stealing the window/focus on startup I like to use the fullscreen mode for as many apps as possible (Mountain Lion).\nWhen I start my apps, they usually go into fullscreen mode but then grab the focus. I'd like to be able to essentially start fullscreen mode apps \"in the background\" and then switch to the window when I am ready to use the app.\nIs this possible?\n\nA: Yes, this is annoying! Many forum posts mention the fix done by\ndefaults write com.apple.Dock workspaces-auto-swoosh -bool NO\n\nwith restarting the Dock afterwards:\nkillall Dock\n\nThis, however, didn't work for my Yosemite 10.10.2 installation.

What I find is that the sequential left to right order of these desktops keeps changing. Is it doing something based on usage ? and how can I disable this ? \n\nA: You can disable it in System Preferences:\n\n", "Q: Is there a keyboard shortcut to close the edit window in Calendar (and retain changes)? In Calendar 6 (mountain lion) when I use command E to bring up an edit window after I make changes I haven't been able to find a keyboard short cut to close that window and keep whatever info I've entered or changed.\nI've searched quite a bit on this question. I've seen using Esc suggested, but that cancels the info/changes. I think that may have worked for older versions of (iCal).\n\nA: As far as I'm aware, there is no single keyboard shortcut to do this.  What you can do is this; after completing your edit, hit \"Command E\" followed by the space bar.  Command E will collapse the edit window and the space bar will dismiss the info box while preserving your edits.\n\nA: If it's an existing event, don't use Cmd+E, use Cmd+I. That's Get Info, but it looks like you can edit just the same. Then Cmd+W closes it.\n\nA: Yeah, enter (⌅ / fn+return). It also selects the default button in other views and applies changes to text objects in Photoshop.\n\nA: In Calendar Preferences, under the advanced tab, turn off the function that asks you before you change an event, and then just hit Command + W and it closes it.  \n", "Q: Why doesn't /usr/libexec/java_home recognize JDK 1.8?

I've tried running the install in compatibility mode but no luck.\nI've tried uninstalling the touchpad from the device manager and reinstalling from the Bootcamp drivers folder but it still has \"This device is not configured correctly. (Code 1)\" as the device status.\nAnyone got any ideas?  I'm willing to upgrade Snow Leopard if it's certain to fix this issue.\n\nA: I think your MBP will handle Bootcamp v4 - you could try installing it from Windows, it runs as Bootcamp Services, and may alleviate some of your problems. I have done a similar thing on my 2009 13\" MBP - all works fine apart from tapping (not clicking) the touchpad. Two finger scroll works but not tap-clicks. All very frustrating.\n", "Q: How to set up Safari to always show status bar I am using Safari 6.0.2 (8536.26.17) within Mac OS X 10.8.2. \nI would like to know how to set Safari so that, whenever a new window is opened, the status bar is always turned on. \nI think this used to be a preference setting but it doesn't appear to be available in this version. \nWhenever I open a new window, there is no status bar.\nI know how to use the keyboard shortcut to turn it on and off. I'm looking for a way not to have to use the shortcut each time.\nIs this doable? Thanks for your advice.\n\nA: I think I found a command-line solution, opening up the Terminal and typing in the following:\n$ defaults write com.apple.Safari ShowStatusBar -boolean true\n\n\nA: Odd, because I have the Status Bar visible, and every time I open a new window, it is visible. I wonder if you don't have some kind of extension causing yours to not show. The View > Show Status Bar command is not for each window, but is global, so it should work all the time. \n", "Q: Firewall Being turned off Is it possible for an application to close my OSX firewall? Several times I have opened the security pref and I find FireWall off while I do not remember turning it off. For antivirus I use ClamXav which doesnt have a firewall so it should not be it... Is there a way to check if some application is closing the firewall ?\n\nA: Check /Applications/Utilities/Console.app after the firewall is turned off.\nThere might be a message about the change.\n\nA: If you give an application your administrative password (during e.g. a software installation or update) it can indeed change your system settings. An application running on the system that have been granted administrative rights can also turn it off. Try turning the firewall on, rebooting the machine, and see if it’s then turned off when you boot it. Should help troubleshoot if it’s a local program that causes this.\nI’d actually suspect that you do it yourself or someone else who have access to the machine does it. In any case, had Apple enabled the firewall by default you could be more certain that either you, a piece of local software, or another user is turning it off for you.\nAs for ClamXav, it does not provide a competing firewall service nor does it have any interest in disabling your firewall. Nor would any code-signed application (from the Mac App Store or signed using an Apple Trusted Certificate from the wider internet) have any incentive for turning off the firewall. These applications are given access automatically, so they would not need to interfere  with it either. \n", "Q: Block incoming mail I'd like to use my mail app as an outgoing service only.\nI recently discovered a trojan in an incoming message and I prefer to read my messages online anyway.\nIs there any way to accomplish this?\nRegards\n/M\n\nA: I believe the best way is to leave the account enabled in mail. \n\n\n*\n\n*Open \"Preferences\".\n\n*Select an account.\n\n*In the \"Advanced\" tab for that account, turn off \"Include when automatically checking for new messages\". \n\n\nThen, you can still send messages but it won't automatically get mail any more. Note that you can still click the check mail icon at the top of the window, and that will still initiate a manual Send/Receive.\n\nA: See https://discussions.apple.com/thread/2033936?start=0&tstart=0 \nHere is the answer according to that thread:\nTo Take Offline, click on Mailbox in the menubar, and choose the second reference to Online/Offline (Online Status) -- there you can select each account separately to take Offline, but this leaves the account in the Sidebar and available to send from.\n", "Q: Make Preview automatically reload PDF without switching to it If I change the contents of a PDF file that is open in Preview, it automatically reloads it when I switch to the program.  Is there a way to make it do this without explicitly switching to the program?\nThe reason is that I am writing LaTeX, and I would like to see the updated PDF, but switching between Preview and back is a little annoying each time.  For now, I have a line in my Makefile that just does\nopen $(FILEPREFIX).pdf\nopen -a iTerm\n\nevery time it builds the document (I use emacs in the terminal as my text editor), but even this is a little annoying, especially since I would like to write a hook in emacs that automatically builds the document at regular intervals, and this would cause it to jump away from the editor. \nP.S. I know that Skim can do this.  But I've found its autoupdating to be unreliable (i.e., sometimes it just stops doing it altogether, and I have to manually reload the document; if someone knows how to fix that, I would appreciate that as well).\n\nA: I have never had problems with Skim not being able to keep up, but I use latex-makefile which generates temporary PDFs under other names until the very last pass. Perhaps you could try using that and see if it works, or adjusting your own Makefile similarly?\n", "Q: iCal event invite colors I receive ical event invites from my boss all time. Once I accept the invite and it goes to the ical on my mac, the color of the event changes into the default blue on my mac. My question is, how do I keep the original color of the invite reflect on my calendar? For example, if the color of the event on my boss' mac was orange, how do I keep it's orange color once I accept the invite and it appears on my calendar?\n\nA: I think that's not possible. When you accept an invitation you can choose one of your calendars (which can have different colors) to add the appointment. If you don't choose a calendar it will go to your default calendar.\nSo the only work around I can think of, is to create the same calendars that your boss has, and then select the appropriate one when you receive an invitation.\n", "Q: Creating partition for Diskwarrior I am fixing my friend's '07 MacBook Pro.  The superdrive keeps spitting out discs and the harddrive is corrupt.  I want to run Disk Warrior 4.4 but can't because of the Superdrive problem. The computer has two partitions.  I erased the second, XP one and now it's available as a Mac Drive.  My question is, can I mount the Diskwarrior program on this drive in such a way that I can boot into it as if it was a Boot CD?  I'm a PC technician and so am a little lost with the finer details of Mac. \n\nA: A couple of options:\n1)  Use an external DVD drive connected via USB to boot into the Disk Warrior DVD\nI use a spare IDE DVD-R drive from an old PC connected with a Newer Tech USB to IDE adapter.  I have had to do this a few times with a Mac Mini Server.  The only problem is that booting this way is VERY slow.\n2)  If you have access to another Mac, connect the problem machine to the good mac with a Firewire cable and boot the damaged machine holding down the \"T\" key to enter Firewire Target Disk Mode\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/HT1533?viewlocale=en_US&locale=en_US\nThen run Disk Warrior from the good Mac on the problem Mac's drive.\nFor the future:  These are better options but probably not as easy at this point.\nI try to have a USB flash drive around with a clone (via Carbon Copy Cloner) of a working system that contains the emergency utilities like Disk Warrior.  I can then boot from it if needed.\nI also like keeping a bootable clone on an external hard drive with Disk Warrior already installed as part of my backup strategy.\nYou can select an alternate boot volume when turning on the machine by holding down the <option> key.\n", "Q: Is there a mac utility that can magnify parts of the screen? For some teaching efforts, especially running through tutorials, I'd like to zoom in on parts of my screen to show a room-full of people small text from the projected screen. Is there an OS X utility that will magnify sections of the screen as I move my cursor over it? I know about OmniDazzle but the magnifier is somewhat clunky.\n\nA: Go to System Preferences, then Accessibility. There will be a column on the left for Zoom, which you can use a keyboard shortcut to activate.\n\nOnce activated, hitting ⌥-⌘-+ will zoom the screen.\n\nA: You don't say which version of osx you are using, in 10.8.2 go to system preferences, accessibility, zoom, then under zoom style select picture-in-picture. The zoom box will follow your cursor. Older versions had this option not sure of the steps for other versions.\n\nA: Try the following apps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Zoom It\n\n*Virtual Magnifying Glass\nThere are at least one other, but Zoom It app is the one that most reviews recommend. I use it with a 40 inch 4k display. Awesome!\n\nA: Digital Color Meter can do that but unfortunately AFAIK its window is not resizable.\n", "Q: Business-oriented calendar app for OS X I'm looking for a calendar app for OS X that shows available times for meeting attendees, and allows me to propose meetings and accept such proposals from others.\nI've been trying Mac calendar and BusyCal, and neither of them meet my needs.\nWe're using Google app as our calendar server and although I can always use their web interface I prefer to use an installed application.\n\nA: If you have an Exchange server, Outlook will do that. Calendar for OS X can do it too, provided your calendar server supports it.  OS X Server's Calendar server does.\nIn either use case the parties must be in the same organization or otherwise accessible due to federation.\n", "Q: Why file links appear in the folder sidebar and how can I prevent this from happening? My question is related to Remove link to something that is not a folder in the Finder sidebar, but my problem is fundamentally different. \nI still have file links appearing in my folder sidebar. But I know how to remove those links, I just right-click and choose the option Remove from the sidebar. \nI actually have no idea how files end up appearing in there: I don't drag them, I don't do anything special. Actually, if I drag them, I get a nice Forbidden icon. So I don't get how they should even appear. \nSo why do they appear there and how can I prevent this from happening?\nI have Mountain Lion 10.8.2.\n\nA: You might accidentally be pressing the shortcut commandT which means “Add to Sidebar” in the Finder but is used for many different things in many other applications. So if you think another application is frontmost where actually the Finder is you'd accidentally add the currently selected file to the sidebar. Happened to me a few times.\n", "Q: OS X as X Window Server Is it possible to serve Mac applications like iPhoto over a network to X Window clients?\n\nOur problem is that a broken Graphics card is causing a lot of stripes etc on the screen.\nOther remote solutions doesn't circumvent the problem.\nThis is a G5 PowerPC.\n\nA: No, it isn't. iPhoto and nearly every application on OS X don't run under X11 environment. They have no idea about X11 and cannot be transmitted via X11. Besides, the server component of X-Window runs on the computer whose display is used. You are actually looking for a way to make iPhoto transmit its appearance to a different window server.\n", "Q: Does Mac OSX Mountain Lion autosave/versions interact badly with git? I use git with some of my documents and wonder if the autosaved versions created by Mountain Lion could interfere (or even break) git versioning? \nThis is important for me as I do not work on Macs exclusively. Do I need to edit my .gitignore file to account for the native versioning system in OS X?\n\nA: Short answer: don't worry about it.\nThe versions data is kept separate from the file itself, which is why you can just email a file to someone on a different OS and not worry about the version info mucking things up.\nUnless you are checking in the hidden folders where OS X stores temporary files and versions, git will never know if a file is being versioned or saved by the OS. \n", "Q: Is it possible to sync music and podcasts between an iPhone and Mac, but exclude Apps? The standard sync function seems to sync applications between my iPhone and Mac (That is, the applications seem to end up on my Mac.) I don't understand the point of this: they can't be run on the Mac, and if I lost my iPhone, I can download them again from the App Store.  Is there some way to prevent applications from being synced?\n\nA: The point is that they can be restored much quicker from your Mac to an iOS device than downloading them again. This may (of course) depend on the number of apps you have on your iOS device and which sizes they are. (Many games and navigation apps are way over 1GB each.)\nTo prevent app syncing you would just uncheck this box in iTunes while you have selected your iOS device in the sidebar and chosen the Apps category as shown in this screenshot.  \n\n", "Q: Purchased/Rented movie is not played I have purchased/rented a movie (SD) and it is not playing... I have downloaded 1GB and the alert \"ready to play\" does not appear. Besides this, a doubleclick opens the Quicktime window and the player icons, but the movie does not start. The correct time is displayed and when I scroll the timeline I can see the pictures, but the play-button does not start playing the movie... I have the same problem with another movie :-(\nEDIT: I used the native Apple iTunes Store (is there any other store?!)\n\nA: Try setting your computers clock a day in advance.\nI have seen a time-zone issue where the the movie won't play until the computers clock is set to the following day.\nGive that a try.\n\nA: re-start your device, and take a try.\n", "Q: How to Generate a Globe / Sphere of Icons / Images Does anyone know how to generate a sphere of icons like Apple has done in their keynotes.\nSuch as: http://blog.utest.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/iStock_000020649912XSmall.jpg\nor\nhttp://i.istockimg.com/file_thumbview_approve/19391158/2/stock-photo-19391158-media-technologies-concept.jpg\nI remember a few years ago Apple released an app called Core Animation or something that allowed you to create those globes and or 3d walls of images with reflections but I can't seem to find that anymore. If anyone has any advice on an app or web app that would work with a Mac that would be great. Otherwise the only option I see so far is doing it manually in photoshop like this: http://psd.tutsplus.com/tutorials/3d/create-a-spherical-3d-puzzle-with-photoshop/?search_index=2\n\nA: Core Animation is the part of OS X that \"simplifies\" programming animation. It's not a stand-alone program. Not to get too technical, it uses the OS's underlying Quartz APIs for drawing objects onscreen. Quartz Compositor is a stand-alone program that allows for building objects and animations.\nWhat is your final intent of the sphere graphic? Do you need just a static \"3D\" image for a keynote presentation? Will you require a spinning globe? Do you require light rays and interactions as it spins?\nAny good graphic designer or programmer (Apple included!) will make their craft look simple. The 35 major steps in the Photoshop tutorial are a testimony to my statement! The more advanced the need, from web to print to video to HD, the more complex the project.\nHere are my recommendations of places to start, depending upon your output needs:\n\n\n*\n\n*web: Use Photoshop to create your flat artwork then wrap it around a basic 3D object. 72dpi final is all you need. JPG if you don't need transparency, PNG if you do need to preserve transparency.\n\n*print: I'd also use Photoshop as with web, but final artwork needs to be 200dpi to 300dpi.

I have a Macbook Air with 128GB SSD. It's used to be a best practice to put the OS on a separate partition from data.\nDoes that make any sense? What are the advantages to partitioning an SSD?\n\nA: There are no compelling advantages to partitioning the main SSD/HDD for a single OS install under OS X. \nRegardless of SSD vs. HDD, it really only makes sense if you need to re-install your OS frequently (which you shouldn't need to do with OS X), and want to be able to keep your data around while wiping your OS partition. There's no performance benefit to be had, and it requires more tinkering to get things set up (symlinking User directories, etc.).\nOne of the reasons to partition in the past was to improve speeds for some files by taking advantage of the physical location of the data (transfer speeds are higher on the outside of a disk platter). With SSDs, physical location doesn't have an effect on performance, and modern OSes can optimize for best disk performance on HDDs automatically, so there is not much gain to be had from micro managing storage allocation as in the past.\nUnless you have a very specific reason for not doing so, just use one partition and enjoy your Mac.\n\nA: Unless you have two radically different sets of data such as\n\n\n*\n\n*different OSs\n\n*different filesystems\n\n*OS testing installs\n\n*multiple users requiring \"hard\" separation on the same computer\n\n*a whole bunch of stuff you want to keep segregated for legal reasons\n\n\nI personally see very few reasons to partition your 128GB SSD, and a number of reasons to avoid doing so. \nOne pressing reason to avoid partitioning a \"small\" drive: partitions \"waste\" space. I'm not referring to the actual disk overhead lost to store the partition data, but the loss of usability when a larger contiguous chunk of space is broken into two or more smaller storage areas. If your single partition has 80GB of space available, the largest single file can be 80GB in size. If you partition your 128GB drive to split the empty space, each partition would have 40GB of room, thus cutting the largest file you could save in half. \nI use this extreme example to make this point: all partitions end us with some storage space that is \"too small\" to use. Every partition you add multiplies this loss... And your SSD is not large enough to waste space this way.\nSpeaking of \"small\" drives, performance tends to degrade as you fill a partition beyond 75% or 85%. Multiple small partitions tend to reach this percentage filled much faster than a single, larger one.\nIn the early days of hard drives when the OS was effectively still built around floppy drives, there were real upper-end limits to the number of files or size of the logical drive. Partitions not only made sense then, but were mandatory to shoehorn newer and larger technology into existing systems. Today, those reasons are no longer pressing on our minds.\nEven with a MacBook Air, there is no speed advantage to limiting the number of files or size of a partition. Caching and indexing on OS X allow you to \"find\", retrieve and open any file much faster than on platter-based storage.\nIn most cases there is no problem housing multiple users on a single OS X machine. Each user is sequestered from the others and provides decent inter-user security and confidentiality.\nI suggest you look at your thoughts regarding partitions and utilize folders to replicate the storage functionality. Looking at my Mac Pro with a 64GB boot/application/\"user\" drive and a separate array with 6TB of storage, I have the following breakdown on the 6TB drive:\n\n\n*\n\n*documents (not to be confused with ~/users/me/documents)\n\n*\n\n*company accounting files\n\n*personal files\n\n*family files\n\n\n*music\n\n*projects\n\n*\n\n*client project 1\n\n*client project 2\n\n*etc.\n\n\n*storage\n\n*\n\n*archived projects\n\n*program install files\n\n*movies\n\n\n\nI treat each top-level folder as if it was a partition unto itself.\n\nA: Just a point on scratch drives - SSD's are not recommended for scratch (virtual memory) in 2015 for two reasons (there may be more) - SSD's don't enjoy constant overwrite and data swappping and it will reduce the life of an expensive drive.  Using a clean partition set aside on an internal Sata drive such as a WD Black (with 64MB on board cache) will be more than adequate for VM use in programmes such as Photoshop - if you have a Mac Pro tower you can make this even more responsive by installing two identical 1 TB drives and setting them up for Raid - the file is effectively split in two and written to both drives at once to double the speed. I dont set VM on my SSD - I keep it for the OS and primary Admin home folders - that's it.\nPB\n\nA: Yes a partition is useful if you have Photoshop. The scratch disk in CS6 regularly bloats out to 60gig!!! It's unbelievable. My macbook then locks up. I have to reboot PShop every so often to free up space again. I'm about to partition my SSD to avoid it.\n", "Q: How to launch pdf viewer from the terminal I'm working using LaTeX, since I compile the document in the terminal, it would be much easier for me to open it in pdf viewer directly from the terminal.\nI'm using OS X 10.8.2 in Polish, so I'm not sure of the English name of the viewer I'm using, but it's the default one, I guess it's Preview in English. But the command preview <filename.pdf> results in -bash: preview: command not found.\n\nA: You can just use open <filename.pdf> and your OS will use the default program to view PDFs. With open -a Preview.app <filename.pdf> your PDF is opened using Preview, even if your default PDF reader is something different.\n\nA: After discovering the \"open\" answer I wrote the following shell script, which I placed in /usr/bin/acroread:\n#!/bin/sh\n/usr/bin/open $1\n\nDon't forget to chmod +x /usr/bin/acroread.

Usually . (for the current directory) is not part of $PATH (primarily for security reasons), to run commands in the current directory type ./myapp.\n\nA: This is because when you type \"myapp\" is not in the current path, just because you cd into a directory does not mean it will be on the path to run the program.\nYou need to type ./myapp  or add \"./\" to your path so that your shell will look in the current directory for \"myapp\" etc.\n", "Q: Wireless Keyboard Connection I have the wireless bluetooth connecting keyboard for the iMac and it continues to disconnect even when the batteries are brand new. Is there anyway to enhance the bluetooth connection so that it will stop disconnecting?\n\nA: I guess you are using the original Apple keyboard?

There are some specific apps that he is interested in; are all apps available for iPhone 4 also available for iPhone 5, or do developers have to port them?\n\nA: All for previous iPhone and iPod touch devices will run, but won't necessarily be optimized for the larger screen. If that's the case, the app will run at the previous (3.5\" size) with a black bar above and below the app's content.\n\nA: It is far, far more common for a developer to specify that an application needs a minimum iOS level as opposed to not being available on a specific device.\nFor the applications that are available only for some devices, the most common (by far) restriction is that they test for new hardware and refuse to run on an older device. If an application needed multiple microphones to do noise cancelling, one would presume that it might not install or run on an older iPhone that had only one microphone.\nIn your case - apps purchased and running on an old phone are almost certainly going to run on newer hardware. The worst that would happen is that the app wouldn't take use of the entire larger screen and only draw itself centered using most of the iPhone 5's slightly taller screen.\n", "Q: How can I combine text messages from my old iPhone with my new iPhone? I just bought a new iPhone 5 and used it before restoring the backup from my old iPhone 4. Now I would like to restore the backup from my old phone without loosing the text messages already on my new phone. If I back up the new phone first and then restore the backup from the old phone, will the content from the new phone be lost?\n\nA: When you restore the backup from your old phone all content currently on the phone will be erased.  There is no official or user friendly way to merge iOS backup files.  The methods that do exist are very hackie and involve jailbreaking your phone first but none of them are currently compatible with iOS 6.  \nWhile there is currently no way for you to merge the two SMS files together you don't have to completely loose the messages that are already on your phone.  You can use a program such as PhoneView or iExplorer to retrieve the SMS files from your new phone before you restore the backup and store them as a text file.  I personaly use PhoneView, but both programs (as well as a slew of others which I'm sure other folks will by happy to point out) work equally well.  \nAs a final note, if merging the the text messages from the two backups is the only way to go for you, there is a method that is not currently compatible with iOS 6 but likely will be at some point in the future.  As I said above, it's hackie and may require a jailbreak but once it's updated to work with iOS 6 will do what you're asking for.  The script is available at https://smsmerge.homedns.org.

I had a nearly full 500GB drive in my MacBook Pro, running Snow Leopard. As the near-full capacity was becoming problematic, I bought two 1TB drives, went home, ran Time Machine on one of them, and then returned to my local Apple store (here in Taiwan), where they installed the other new drive.\nWhile I was not present (and therefore did not see what was happening), they swapped one drive for the other, and set up my MacBook with Snow Leopard and what looks like most of my old applications.  By this I mean that the operating system works and the Applications folder is full of familiar faces, but the desktop background is gone, the multitude of folders (full of my beloved data) on the desktop were gone, and none of my system settings or preferences were the same as before this process began.\nThey told me to go home, enter the Time Machine, and restore the system from the last update. I went home and dutifully complied (I thought...).  As there was a lot of data, this took a few hours.  Returning to the computer later on, I saw that the Time Machine progress bar window was gone, which I assumed to mean the process was done.  I ejected the Time Machine drive and restarted the computer (as it still looked the same to me...) to find it in the same state as it was several minutes, and in fact, hours, before.\nThinking I could repeat this process but get different results, I returned to the Time Machine and tried again, with predictably similar results. This time, however, I noticed three things of note:\n\n\n*\n\n*using \"Get Info\" on the \"Macintosh HD\" icon on my desktop (now the only icon to be found there) revealed that the 1TB internal drive was about half full, and\n\n*using Spotlight I found that some of the contacts in my Address Book are somehow still here; but there's a confusing bit: when I open the Address Book, there are only 2 contacts there.  The others that I can see all appear in Spotlight, but by hovering over them I cannot seem to reveal their location, and\n\n*when I enter Time Machine now, the icon for the backup drive has changed from the blue circle-having Time Machine icon to the standard orange USB-type icon, and once inside, I cannot find the backup point for the last backup before replacing the 500GB drive with the 1TB drive. I can see these Contact cards, but using spotlight to find my music, movies, or data files (like Pages and other text stuff) does not make them apparent. I cannot figure out why the internal HD is so full if the data is not there somewhere. The applications and system-related info on my HD was never all that space-consuming before. It was my increasingly large collection of photos and data that seemed to be eating up the old drive.\n\n\nHappily, nothing has happened or been done to, the old drive, except it is now in a case as an external HD.  I plugged it in to one of my USB ports, and it appears on the desktop, complete with its old special icon, and full of its beautifully-not deleted contents and data. I know this because I used Finder to explore it, and it looks like everything is there where it should be.\nI am hoping there is a way to run Migration Assistant, or to follow some other process, and restore my computer to its former health and strength.  I've done this kind of HD swap before, but I've never run into this problem before; the staff at my Apple store have always been highly competent, efficient, and professional.  This time around, my main concern is that if I take it back to the shop again, this problem may worsen, and I'd like to get back to working with my personalized system, and especially the files and data I know are here somewhere as soon as possible. The only solution I've been able to come up with after struggling with it for some time, is to put the old 500GB drive back into the laptop (assuming it will run as it did before.), run Time Machine again, put the new 1TB drive in a second time, and then restore from the backup under responsible, knowledgeable, Apple Store supervision.\nSimilarly, can I plug in the old drive, somehow use Time Machine to back it up, and then run the restore from there? Or does anyone have a better method?\n\nA: So, to summarise, if I understand correctly, you have:\n\n\n*\n\n*old 500GB drive in an external case, with good data\n\n*new 1TB installed internally, with bad data\n\n\nI would do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Plug in the external 500GB drive.\n\n*Hold the option (alt) key whilst turning on the Mac, then choose to boot from the external drive.\n\n*Erase the internal drive using Disk Utility.\n\n*Copy the contents of the external drive to the internal.  This can be done using the Restore pane in Disk Utility, or alternatively Carbon Copy Cloner or SuperDuper!.  SuperDuper is perhaps the easiest to use here.\n\n\nA: There is an alternative method, although cloning the original drive to the new one is a better method, as is likely faster, but this is an option...\nCreate another admin user, one that does not exist on any of the systems you use, and then delete your current user account (assuming you've backed up new stuff to another drive).\nLogin to the new account and run migration assistant, and get it to restore from your old 500 GB drive.\nOnce it is done you will be back up and running with your old user account. Login to it and delete the extra admin account you created.\nEnjoy...\n", "Q: Organizing skype downloads in subfolders with contact names I always wondered why skype don't put all my accepted downloads in subfolders with the name of my contacts! \nIf anybody have own solutions, share)\n\nA: So I made a script and saved it as a folder action:\nfor f in \"$@\"\ndo\n    userFolder=~/Downloads/Skype/`xattr -p com.apple.metadata:kMDItemWhereFroms \"$f\" | sed -e 's/0D//g' -e 's/.*\\(5F 10\\)...//' -e 's/00.*//'| xxd -r -p | sed -e 's@ (.*@@g'`\n    mkdir -p \"$userFolder\"\n    mv \"$f\" \"$userFolder\"\ndone\n\nWhat it does:\n\n\n*\n\n*gets where from field from file.

Paste into the new plain text textedit document(this makes the text you want instead of pasting the songs.\n\n*Now while you are still in the plain text textedit document select all and copy.\n\n*Go into to document where you want to paste the data, (in my case I do it in an Excel document)\n\n*Now just paste the data in\n\n\nWhat I am doing is using a plain text document to make the data I copied from iTunes i to plain text then I and copying that plain text version and pasting it where I want it to be.\n\nA: So here is the script:\n(*\n\"Export As HTML Table\" for iTunes\nwritten by

It used to connect to the wifi router (D-Link N300, DIR=615) no problems.  But for the past several weeks, I haven't been able to at all.\nWhat pops up when I select my wifi network from the list:\n\n\n*\n\n*\"Failed to join \"network\"\nA connection timeout occured\".\n\n\nWhat happens when I try to enter my password manually:\n\n\n*\n\n*\"Connection timeout\"\n\n\nWhat I've tried to do as solutions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Google\n\n*Restart router by pressing reset & refresh button\n\n*Delete System & User (Login) Keychain access\n\n*Network > Gear symbol by the + and - bottom left of the screen > Set Service Order > Drag Wifi to the top\n\n\nA: A common fix for this is to make a new location under the Network pane in System Preferences.\nOpen System Preferences. Click on Network. In the window that loads after that, near the top, is a drop-down menu labelled \"Location:\" Click on the drop-down menu and choose \"Edit Locations...\" In the next window that slides down click the + sign.  A new line will appear ready to be given a name. I usually enter the date to help me keep track of when I made the new location, and to help prompt my memory why I did it. Give it a name. When you click ok that new location will load automatically. You may have to delete the extra connections you don't use, such as Bluetooth PAN, or Firewire, just to keep the side pane clean. In that side pane choose Wi-Fi, wait for it to automatically locate and attempt to connect to your wireless network, enter your password (and/or whatever steps you do, if you manually have to enter the wi-fi name if it is hidden, for example), and voila, connected again.\nBut no one really knows why it lost the connection in the first place. Just a weird bit about OS X.\n\nA: Going into keychain and deleting the entry for the wifi network solved it. Just connected to the network again and entered my credentials.\nThere was something wrong with either the password (I doubt this) or the authentication mechanism that was somehow paired with the keychain entry.\nAnyway, this also means that going the manual way, as suggested by drovnik will also work, though I have not tried it.\n\nA: Usually when connection timeout occurs, you can attempt the following common solutions.\n\n\n*\n\n*Turn off WiFi and turn it back on.\n\n\nYou can try resetting the connection information for your router by \"forgetting\" the router information:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to System Preferences > Network: Wifi -> Advanced.\n\n*Remove your Preferred Network.\n\n*Rejoin network.\n\n\nYou can try resetting your router:\n\n\n*\n\n*Unplug your router and plug it back in after 10-20 seconds.\n\n\nYou can't transmit on the same channel as other wifi networks. If there is a conflicting router, it may be taking precedence over your router.\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to About this Mac -> More Info... -> System Report -> Network: Wi-Fi\n\n*If your router is running on the same channel as other networks, try changing that:\n\n*Plug in via ethernet or try getting closer to your router...\n\n*Connect to your router (IP is located in the connection information in your Network preferences)\n\n*Change the Router channel to a channel that's not being used by other networks around you.\n\n*Restart your router.\n\n\nIf the above still doesn't work, a corrupt entry in your keychain may be the culprit:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Keychain Access\n\n*Find all the entries that match your router.\n\n*Highlight all matching entries and delete them.\n\n\nIf the above still doesn't work, try some of the troubleshooting tips from here: Wifi Dropping in OSX Lion - Fixes\nIf all else fails, upgrade to Mountain Lion. That will solve everything. :) \n\nA: From my experience, the easiest solution is to MANUALLY join the wifi network.\nOpen the wifi menu and click \"Join Other Network...\".\nIn pop-up dialog explicitly enter the network name, encryption method and password.\nThat's it. Works every time in these situations.\n\nA: Been there, done that. I found the source to my problem, but not something that might be a general answer for all with this problem. \nAfter exhausting the other answers here, I just started trying anything. What I discovered was that I have an external HD connected by firewire, and had it running when I rebooted after installing software. With the drive running, no connection. I shut off the drive and it immediately connected. Go figure! It runs fine of I start the drive after startup, but not during. (Mac Mini C2D 2.54, OS X 10.8.3)\nPerhaps the wires acted as antenna or otherwise changed the power available to the Wi-Fi chipset, but I'm not seeing these timeouts after changing my connected devices and cables.\n\nA: Shane's Answer above is very good but would probably be my 4th step.  Prior to that, I would first try turning off and on wifi, followed by power cycling the router (physically disconnect the power, wait 1 min then restore power), and then re-starting the computer.  These are all very simple steps but are good things to try before you begin changing settings and re-building connections.\n\nA: I too had the same problem. Really easy solution. Turn off WiFi on your iPad as it may have chosen the same IP address as your Mac. Then your Mac may well join. Restart your iPad, it will choose a different IP.\n\nA: My problem was the Keychain Access, I cleared the Belkin chains from the System and it fixed it instantly. I was racking my brain.\n\nA: Tried everything suggested here. Nothing works.\nUntil I removed my USB flash drive. It worked immediately.\n", "Q: Siri and birthday events One of Apple's calendar features on every device is that it takes the birthdays from the contacts and show them as a separate birthday calendar. This is a nice feature, but has a huge drawback in my workflow:\nSince I do a lot of driving I use Siri a lot to create calendar events. But when somebody of my contacts has birthday on the day I want to schedule a meeting (or whatsoever) the birthday event is recognized as a full-time event, what causes Siri to warn me, that I already have an appointment - what is obviously not true because it's \"only\" a birthday. Siri of course then tell me which appointments I have \"at the same time\" (which is a feature when you are connected via bluetooth), so at least I know, that this are only birthdays and I can schedule a meeting anyways, but this is also annoying, because if there are like 5 birthdays that day, it takes a pretty long while until Siri read all appointments to me.\nSo my question is: Is there any way to to get rid off the full-time status of the birthday calendar or even make Siri ignoring this birthday events (without deleting every birthday from any of my contacts)?\n\nA: There is no way to make Siri stop seeing the Birthday calendar, even if you disable it in the Calendar app. You can always write feedback to Apple or file a bug report (free developer account required).\n", "Q: How to subscribe to particular IMAP folders in Mac Mail I use Mac Mail to work with an IMAP account. Is it possible to subscribe only to a set of folders, e.g., synchronize only the folder \"current\" and all its subfolders, but not the folder \"archive\"? I tried right-click on folder > Account Information > Abonnements/Subscriptions but there no folders are listed.\n\nA: I had this same issue. I am using Mail version 8.2.\nI found this to be a fix for me.\nWhen I create a new account in Mac Mail, it shows the account name under \"Inbox.\"\nUnder that account name are four folders - Sent, Drafts, Junk, and Trash.\nYou have to click on one folder at a time to highlight it, then in the top menu, select Mailbox > Use This Mailbox As > and select the correct mailbox (Sent, Drafts, Junk, or Trash).\nWhen I did this, my Sent, Trash, Junk, and Draft folders that were under my email account name, moved under the \"Main\" Sent, Trash, Junk, and Draft sections. It took a second or two for them to sync to the server and not show a warning sign next to the folder name.\nUnder Mail > Preferences > Accounts > Advanced, I left the IMAP Path Prefix blank. I did change the Port from 143 to 993, checked the Use SSL box, and set the Authentication to Password. I used these settings because they match what my host provider provided me to use for my Incoming Server settings. I'm not sure this mattered or not.\n\nA: Press command-i (letter i) in Mail.app, select the account in the popup menu and go to the “Subscription List” tab. From there you should be able to select/deselect shared IMAP mailboxes.\n\nA: You're missing the point.  You can't select a folder to use for those classifications if you can't see it in the first place.\n", "Q: Is there a way to browse the OS X App Store from iPad? There are times that I'd like to browse the OS X App Store from my iPad - to get info for future reference.  But when I try, I get a message that I have to use a Mac.\nIs there a way around this?\n\nA: As @jaume has mentioned, you can use the Mac App Store Preview on Apple's Website to browser apps from the Mac App Store. The same exists for iOS apps and is labeled as iTunes Preview.\nAs you will have already noticed, the search box on Apple's website is not very helpful when searching for Apps. The best alternative I can think of uses a google query. In the Google search box type:\nsite:https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ \"Mac App Store\" MyKeyword\n...which uses the URL:\nhttp://www.google.com/search?&q=site:https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/%20%22Mac%20App%20Store%22%20\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy and paste the URL\n\n*Add your keyword to the end (separate multiple keywords by %20)\n\n", "Q: How can I open Google Chrome in Presentation mode using a shell script Previously in 10.6.8, I was able to start Google using \nopen /Applications/Chrome.app --args --kiosk http://www.google.com\nNow, on newer systems, that does not work anymore correctly. The only way to get rid of the address bar seams to be using of the presentation mode.\nDoes anyone know the switch to call that mode?\nI use the shell script for a presentation computer to start the browser on startup automatically in fullscreen mode.\nAny help is appreciated.\n\nA: I tested this out and then it wouldn't let me exit kiosk mode. I had to Cmd+Q to get out of Google Chrome. Save the following to a script, something like ChromeKiosk.sh and chmod +x ChromeKiosk.sh to get it to run.\n#!/bin/bash\nopen \"/Applications/Google Chrome.app\" --args --kiosk http://www.google.com.au\n\nThis will open Google Chrome to the http://www.google.com.au webpage. Change it as you need. Copy and paste the rest of the script\nIf you want to turn it into an AppleScript so that you can create an application that can in turn be automatically run each time the computer reboots to a default specified user, use the following code and when you save the script, change it's type to Application\ndo shell script \"/bin/bash open \\\"/Applications/Google Chrome.app\\\" --args --kiosk\"\n\nIt's requires the \\ (escape sequence) before the \" because of the way the shell reads the spacing between the words Google and Chrome in the filename. You can also write it as \ndo shell script \"/bin/bash open /Applications/Google\\\\ Chrome.app --args --kiosk\"\n\nIt's just that I've never favoured the look of seeing a escape before a backslash. It's too messy. Stick with either the BashScript option at the top or use the 1st of 2 AppleScript lines and save it as an Application type.\n", "Q: Location Indicator, Hollow vs. Solid The location indicator in the top bar of iOS seems to have two states: hollow and solid.\nHollow:\n\nAnd solid:\n\nI know that the icon is visible whenever an application is using Location Services, what's the difference hollow and solid?\n\nA: The hollow location indicator is used to show that one or multiple applications have active geofences. For example, you can use Reminders.app to remind you of something “when you get home”. To detect when you are near your home location it has to check your location every now and then to compare it to your home. This will usually happen when you unlock your phone (indicator goes solid for a moment), when your GSM chip hands over to a different cell and when you associate with a wifi network (WPS). This icon is shown so you know that location services are activated at irregular intervals which may affect your battery life.\nThe solid indicator means it is actively locating your device. You will notice, after opening the Maps.app, for example, that the indicator turns solid and remains solid. This is because Maps.app wants your exact location constantly. For a few other examples, when you start Siri, this indicator will also appear, as well Local Weather, or the Camera app (if geo-tagging has been left on).\n", "Q: Does iTunes sync Volume Adjustment and other per song settings? Does iTunes sync per song settings like Volume Adjustment, EQ, and Start-Stop times?\n\nA: Start and stop times do sync, as well as volume adjustments.\nEQ settings sync as well. However, they only work under the following conditions:\n\n\n*\n\n*You used a preset in iTunes (not custom EQ settings); and\n\n*You have EQ disabled on the phone.\n\n\nAs backwards as that second one sounds, if you EQ enabled on the phone, it uses that EQ setting and overrides the per-song EQ settings. If you have EQ disabled on the phone, it uses the per-song EQ settings.\n", "Q: How does one view pictures fullscreen on iPhone 5? There is an annoyance in the iPhone 5 that the camera sensor is 4:3 but the phone display is 16:9. This makes photos not cover the entire screen.\nApple has now begun running a Thanksgiving commercial where they show the person viewing their photos and it takes up the whole screen of the phone.\nIs there some setting configuration that I can change to display pictures fullscreen?\nYou can see the commercial here.\n\nA: Double tap on the photo to make it full screen. Alternatively, you can see toward the end of the commercial, a simple swipe to the left or the right brings up subsequent photos full screen without the overlay of controls on the top or bottom.\n\nA: I am certainly no expert here but what I do after taking a picture I go back and view it of corse. If I want to make it full screen I zoom in or stretch it only enough to fill the whole screen. I center it the way I want and then I simply take a screen shot by pressing the home key and off button at the same time. When you pull the screen shot back up it will be full screen. You will lose a slight amount picture quality or resalotion and it also seems to take a little longer to send it by text or email but for me its worth the trade off. You can basicly do the same thing by editing and cropping with a 16:9 aspect ratio. You would think with modern technology they could at least give us that option to do that and not loose any picture quality. I Hope that will help some of you and also hope to learn a better way to do this.\n\nA: Take a picture, stretch it to the size you want, when it fits nicely, take a picture of the screen by pushing the home key and on off button at the same time. Your photo will be put in your photos full screen... It is simple, you can do it!\n\nA: Tap the picture once.  This hides the top and bottom menu bars.\n", "Q: View play counts on iPad or iPhone? Is it possible to view play counts on iPad, or iPhone, in the Music app, like one can in iTunes?\nI am running iOS 6.\n\nA: The Music app is pretty limited in terms of the metadata it displays. At the moment it's not possible to view the play counts for songs.\nThird party apps can access your music collection, but I'm not sure how much metadata is exposed to them. It may be possible to see play counts with a third party app, but I don't know for sure, nor do I know of any apps that do this.\n\nA: There's an app for iOS 7 than now allows you to do it, it's called PlayCounts. It allows you to create playlist on the fly by selecting play counts of the songs, and see how many times you have played each song.\n\nA: For anyone looking for the answer to this in 2017, the previously mentioned PlayCounts app seems to be no longer available. There's a free app called Song Data that works for this now.\n\nA: For anyone looking for a way to do this in these modern days, the ability to view play count stats is still not built into the Music app on iOS, though it is on macOS. The recommended apps aren’t on the App Store any longer or aren’t being updated, so I built my own. :)\nMusic Info lets you select a song to view its info - play count, last played, and other metadata. It works inside the Music app too with the share sheet action.\nMaybe one day Apple will build this into Music but until then this app will do the trick!\n", "Q: Is there a way to change the OSX system font size per monitor? I'm wondering if there is a way to change the OSX system font size per monitor (e.g. larger for Retina and smaller on external display) ?\nI know how to change it system wide (as covered by How can I change the system font size in OS X?), but I would like to do it on a per monitor basis.\nNote I am not talking about changing the display's resolution - Macbook Pro Retina running at native resolution.\nI understand there some challenges with windows that cross display boundaries, but my thought is the system/tool could use the default for the display that contains the greatest % of the window.\n\nA: No. There is no way to change the OSX system font size per monitor per window.\nThe key is that each separate OSX window is rendered as one. With that, each window can span over, or moved between, multiple monitors. When a window is part of multiple screens at the same time, different font sizes at different parts of same the window would be inoperable.\n", "Q: How to determine how used up my ssd is? I have a Late 2011 Mac Book Pro with 256GB SSD, and I run a lot of virtual machines and apps that do disk io, database, development environment, application servers.  I usually only have about 15GB of free disk space on this machine. \nI know that SSD drives are have a limited number of writes, is there a utility on Mac OSX that can tell me how \"used up\" my SSD. The machine seems to be getting solwer and if my SSD is getting to used I will get a new SSD. \nupdate \nAPPLE SSD TS256C:\n\n  Capacity: 251 GB (251,000,193,024 bytes)\n  Model:    APPLE SSD TS256C                        \n  Revision: CJAA0201\n  Serial Number:            X17A40U7K6LK\n  Native Command Queuing:   No\n  Removable Media:  No\n  Detachable Drive: No\n  BSD Name: disk0\n  Medium Type:  Solid State\n  TRIM Support: Yes\n  Partition Map Type:   GPT (GUID Partition Table)\n  S.M.A.R.T. status:    Verified\n  Volumes:\ndisk0s1:\n  Capacity: 209.7 MB (209,715,200 bytes)\n  BSD Name: disk0s1\n  Content:  EFI\nMacintosh HD:\n  Capacity: 250.14 GB (250,140,434,432 bytes)\n  Available:    23.48 GB (23,483,908,096 bytes)\n  Writable: Yes\n  File System:  Journaled HFS+\n  BSD Name: disk0s2\n  Mount Point:  /\n  Content:  Apple_HFS\nRecovery HD:\n  Capacity: 650 MB (650,002,432 bytes)\n  BSD Name: disk0s3\n  Content:  Apple_Boot\n\n\nA: Your speed issue isn't likely to be because the SSD has been used too much, as sectors would simply stop working and the space would start to decrease rather than slow down.\nThe issue is more likely to be caused by TRIM not being enabled in the OS, so the drive is doing it's garbage collection (sometimes referred to as GC) routines as and when you write information. This will cause a considerable slow down as with TRIM enabled it will happen as soon as space isn't required anymore.\nIf you're running Mountain Lion you can run this script to enable it.\nThere's an app called TRIM Enabler, but based on feedback across a wide variety of sources, I've always avoided it.\nYou can check whether TRIM is enabled by clicking on the Apple logo in the top left corner, About This Mac, More info, System Report, and then scroll down to Serial-ATA, and then look on the right pane for TRIM Support yes/no. If you're not patched, then it will say no.\n", "Q: Mac AppStore badge does not reset after installing update I am experiencing a strange problem: after I installed a bunch of updates, the Mac AppStore badge was not reset.

Today, I got an update for another application; the update count was incremented and was not reset again.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: Rather than rebooting, you can just type killall Dock from your terminal application.

For various reasons, I don't have a copy of all my songs on my computer running Windows 7 with iTunes 11. Is there a way to export my whole library, which contains both songs purchased on iTunes and songs ripped from CDs, to iTunes or elsewhere on my computer?\n\nA: The only means I have ever found of doing this is third-party software. I have used Senuti for this, and can confirm that it works.\nThe current version of Senuti: http://www.fadingred.com/senuti/. The free trial version allows you to restore up to 1000 songs. There is also a fully-free version from 2008 [MD5 (Senuti.0.52.dmg) = e84ebf4614ded95c53dc750492297c87] at http://wstein.org/senuti/, but though the source code is available (there and at SourceForge), it has not been maintained, and I have not confirmed that it still works.\n(You can get an older version from the developer, too.)\nThere is also TouchCopy: http://www.wideanglesoftware.com/touchcopy. It appears to be very complete but is expensive, and the trial version is more limiting than is that of Senuti.\n\nA: I have heard very good reviews of iExplorer and it is designed to do exactly what you seek. I use Phoneview to get at things as I don't need the extra functionality of iExplorer and Phoneview was for sale when I was buying a tool for this a few years back.\n", "Q: Macbook started to consume battery more quickly This seemed to happen after I did several things at once (all of which I have since reversed in trying to track this down):\n\n\n*\n\n*installed a (Crucial M4) SSD drive (replacing my old SATA 5400 RPM drive),\n\n*upgraded from 2GB RAM to 4GB, and \n\n*upgraded to Mountain Lion (from Snow Leopard) \n\n\nFor weeks I've been trying to track down what the problem could be.  I've read all sorts of things about Mountain Lion using more power and various conflicting things on the Crucial forums about whether or not their SSDs consume more or less power (SSDs are generally advertised as being less power-hungry but there are a few conflicting reports!).\nAnyway, I'm now back to my old SATA drive, my original 2 GB RAM and a completely clean install of Snow Leopard.  But I still have a reduced battery life and I can't figure out why.\nWhere I'm at now is that the milliAmps consumed by my MacBook when it is pretty much completely idle (i.e. 1-3% CPU usage in Activity Monitor, All Processes) it is consuming about \n925 mA (according to System Profiler)\nIt fluctuates, but often goes up above 1400 mA and never lower than 750 mA.  I never paid attention to this value before but I know two things:\n\n\n*\n\n*I used to get > 6 hours battery life in normal usage (emails, browsing) and now I get < 4.\n\n*My friend's MacBook idles at around 450 mA.\n\n\nMy fan speed is 1800rpm during this normal usage.\nAny ideas how I can solve this?  Is there perhaps anything else I can reset?  It feels like a hardware issue.\nAlternatively, is there a way to see the number of mA being drawn by the various components of my MacBook?\n\nA: I would look at top -u to see if there are active processes that should not be there.\nI would look at the system profile: Apple => About This Mac => More Info... => System Report => Power and see what it says about the battery... In particular the Condition and Cycle Count.\nTo compare two Macs, be sure the brightness is the same and both are spinning down their disks.\n", "Q: The cheapest and reliable way to unlock iphone 5? What is the cheapest and reliable way to unlock iphone 5? Is there any reliable free solution? \nThe phone is now locked to U.S. Sprint service.\n\nA: The reliable way is to get the carrier to unlock it. In the US - this means\n\n\n*\n\n*Verizon's are sold unlocked in the US whether you have a contract or not. \n\n*AT&T's are locked, but they have a process to get it unlocked once your contract is fulfilled. \n\n*Sprint's situation is unclear.\n\n*T-Mobile's are reported to be sold unlocked in 2013 when they start selling iPhone.\n\n\nCheapest depends heavily on your specific contract details and if you want to risk paying a third party to do something the cell carriers do not like. You could always look for a jailbreak and circumvent the lock, but between paying off your contract early or selling your locked phone and buying one that is legitimately unlocked is an easy, and simply about time and money now that unlocked iPhones are mainstream in the US. I suggest dealing locally in selling and buying an iPhone - connect on craigslist or wherever and meet in an Apple store so that you can check the serial number - be safe in a public space, etc...\n", "Q: Bluetooth connection issues with LG Soundbar and Macbook Pro or iPhone I picked up an LG soundbar a few months back, largely as it allowed me to stream audio using bluetooth which seemed a great idea for streaming from either my MacBook or my iPhone. Since i've had the soundbar i've had issues with this feature though. The streaming is flaky at best, at times it will stream for hours but other times it will drop out endlessly. No matter what dropout I get the device remains paired according to both my MacBook Pro (Mid 2010) and the LG Soundbar. I tend to be streaming using Spotify but i've had the same issues with iPlayer and iTunes also.\nThe symptoms are though that the audio simply stops being outputted by the device whilst it continues to play. Sometimes this is a short dropout (less than a second to a few seconds) and other times it stops for good (although remaining paired). Using my iPhone this seems to happen a little less but it still happens. I talked to LG support who were adamant that there was no issue and that the streaming should be fine. They told me to make sure that I was using the correct Bluetooth profile however which should be A2DP. From what I can tell this is supported by Mac's but I wasn't able to work out if this is what I'm actually using let alone how to switch to it if I'm not. \nThe closest I've got to anyone talking about similar issues is with regard to audio quality over bluetooth from a Mac that can be resolved by adjusting the quality with this command:\ndefaults write com.apple.BluetoothAudioAgent \"Apple Bitpool Min (editable)\" 40\n\nI've tried this and this hasn't improved anything. Heard rumors it could be related to Wi-Fi interference too but nothing solid on this either. Running out of ideas, anyone else have any?\n\nA: I have a samsung soundbar, and an Onkyo, I use bluetooth pairing from my macbook, and motorola phone- exact same issue on both sound bars. Apparently bluetooth pairing just blows. I think it might be interference from the multiple devices in the same area using bluetooth.  (PS4 uses it for the controls, Samsung smart tv uses it for the remote). It definitely is not the macbook, as the problem happens from my smartphone, and I am a support tech for apple, and know how to troubleshoot the mac.\n", "Q: How do i customize the \"title\" on the first page of Wiki Server 4 on OS X Server Mountain Lion? How do i customize the \"title\" on the first page of Wiki Server 4 on OS X Server Mountain Lion?\nThe title says \"OS X Server\" and i want it to say something else... How can i do that?\n\nA: Ok... i did some digging around... and struck gold.\nThe digging part is not for the \"faint of heart\" since the Terminal is your best friend and some coding knowledge is involved. Suffice to say my trip in Wiki Server 4 land led me through Ruby on Rails code.\nI was surprised to find that i'm able to read ruby code, and i don't know Ruby at all.\nAfter looking through Model Views and Controllers i figured out the solution was simpler than i anticipated.\nTo modify the title on the first page you need to edit a .strings file.\nYou need to use the download version (not the mac app store app) of TextWrangler or some other editor that allows Authenticated Saves (save files as other users).\nMake sure the Wiki service is off... the slider in the server app is off.\nThe location of the file depends on your language locale that you use:\n/Applications/Server.app/Contents/ServerRoot/usr/share/collabd/coreclient/locales/en.lproj\nwhere \"en\" can be either de, es, fr, it, ja, ko, nl, zh_CN, zh_TW depending on your wiki language.\n\n*\n\n*First()\nyou need to right click on the file and \"Get Info\" and adjust the permissions temporarily for \"Everyone\" to \"Read and Write\".\nOpen the file in TextWrangler and find the key general.os_x_server and under it you can modify the string \"OS X Server\" to anything you want \"My own company Wiki\".\n\n*\n\n*Save()\nthe file.\n\n\n*Second()\nyou need to right click on the file and \"Get Info\" and adjust the permissions temporarily for \"Everyone\" back to just \"Read\".\n\n\n*Move()\nthe slider in the Server App to On again for the wiki.\nEnjoy!!!\n\nA: An easier solution:\nLoad the front page and 'View Source' in the web browser. \nSave the source as /Library/Server/Web/Data/Sites/Default/index.html\nEdit index.html and change the title (also any additional meta tags).\nThe nice thing about this solution is that it still allows you to edit the content whilst customizing the headers.

When looking to upgrade a MacBook Pro with a solid state drive (SSD), one option is to:\n\n\n*\n\n*First, install the SSD instead of the spinning hard disk drive (HDD).\n\n*Then, install the HDD instead of the optical drive (SuperDrive).\n\n\nAt present, many websites (if not most) suggest to do it this way. However, I am concerned about the safety to the spinning HDD (hard disk drive) when in the SuperDrive slot.\nThe main bay has a sudden-motion-sensor (SMS). It is an accelerometer that detects when the MacBook is falling and prevents damage to the HDD as it is spinning by retracting the reader arm that could scratch the hard disk — damaging/corrupting data.\nAlthough the SuperDrive bay may have the same SATA connector as the main bay (depends on the year of your machine, some have a combination of SATA II and III), it is suggested that it may not have an SMS, which can be a pretty serious issue:\n\nWhy not install the SSD in the regular hard drive bay? Good idea! The\n  only problem is that the regular hard drive bay is the only bay that\n  features sudden motion protection. If you drop your MacBook, it’s\n  smart enough to safely park your non-SSD hard drive so it won’t be\n  damaged by the impact. The optical bay interface has no such feature.\n  This is harmless to your ... SSD because it has no moving parts,\n  but any spinning platter-based drive [HDD] will be at risk if installed in\n  the optical bay. \nYou can have it both ways if your secondary hard drive has its own\n  native sudden motion detection (the ... factory-installed MacBook hard\n  drive [does not]).\n\nBut posts on a forum suggest otherwise.\nWhich do we believe?\n\n\nIf the optical bay lacks the shock sensor, then it would likely be better to leave the HDD where it is, and install the SSD in the optical bay, but this method seems to have an issue with waking from hibernation and sleep.\n\nA: This solution may not directly answer your question, but it may be relevant: I would advise you against putting your HDD in the optical bay.\nI tried that. Putting the SSD in place of the HDD, and moving the HDD in the optical bay, which is just under the keyboard… And I got to hear the noise of the HDD spinning and the noise the heads when accessing cylinders… Bad idea. After a few hours, I switched HDD and SSD.\nSo, I would recommend you to leave the HDD in its bay and to put the SSD in the optical bay. That way your question is solved, and you don't get to hear the HDD working.\nAnd if you notice an extra delay when booting, just select the SSD (which is in the optical bay) as booting drive in the system preferences. You will need to enter your password twice, once and for all. Then, your mac will immediately find the SSD when starting up.\n\nA: Some drives have the sudden motion sensor (SMS) built-in. On my 2011 15\" Macbook Pro the Toshiba drive has it built-in. I can confirm this because when I simulate a 'drop' I can hear the drive heads park. When I disable SMS through Trim Enabler and do the drop, there is no clicking. \nMy Toshiba sits in the opti-bay. My SSD sits in the drive bay. \nI am reporting severe battery drain (I still keep my user data on my Toshiba drive) and it seems my macbook is heating up more too -- Diablo 3 and SC2 FPS is dropping when my fans are going full blast. I don't recall that happening before the opti-bay upgrade. \n", "Q: Can iPhoto create a board book? I'm looking to make a board book for my 2 year old son.

It is common to replace a MacBook Pro's hard disk drive (HDD) with an solid state drive (SSD), however, that may pose a threat to the HDD if installed in the optical bay instead of the SuperDrive.*\nTherefore, that leaves the option of:\n\n\n*\n\n*Leaving the existing HDD where it is.\n\n*Then installing the SSD instead of the optical drive (SuperDrive) with a bracket.\n\n*While still using the SSD as the main boot drive.\n\n\nSome websites mention that there may be issues with sleep and hibernation if this is done.\nIs that true? Can it be mitigated?\nAre there other issues with this approach? \n* It could also mean that the HDD will be louder, since the main bay where it is usually housed has rubber to muffle vibration noises.\n\nA: I usually place the lighter drive in the optical bay since it's not as securely connected to the body as the intended HDD slot. This also plays into the rubber shock mounts for the HDD which both protect it from accelerations as well as isolating/dampening whatever vibration the drive motors cause.\nAs phrased, you may get a null answer since there may not be any issues with either placement. Macs can boot from external drives and have no problems writing the sleep image to an external USB or Thunderbolt drive since the OS wants to keep the system on one drive.\nThe only issues I've seen are people using links to place some of the core OS and support files on a secondary drive rather than just placing user files (home folders) and safer documents on a manual/fixed tiered storage system.\nWith core storage and Apple's broad support of any SSD to comprise a FusionDrive the need to micromanage what files live on which tier of storage might hopefully become a thing of the past.\n\nA: Some Macbook Pros don’t have full SATA III in the optical drive bay so I opted to put my samsung 840 pro into the main bay to take full advantage of the speed.\nOn your mac, open up “system information” (applications/utilities/system information). Find \"SATA/SATA Express” in the side bar. Click on the SATA Connection and see under “negotiated Link Speed” for your optical drive.\nThere is a slight hiss from having the HD in the optical bay, but it’s barely noticeable and it’s a WD Black 7200 rpm.\nThere are issues with hibernation but I just turned it off since I turn off my computer if I’m going anywhere far and boot times with an SSD are ridiculously fast.\n", "Q: Any way to never update an iOS device / not download the image? I have an iPod touch for development that I'm keeping on 4.3.  However, it has downloaded the seed for 6.0.  Is there anyway to tell it not to download 6.0 and to recover the memory that the seed is using?  It's a fairly substantial amount for an 8 gig device.\n\nA: What do you mean it has downloaded the seed? iOS 4.3 does not have an OTA update mechanism, so there's no way it could have downloaded the update.\nI think it is possible to remove the OTA files, it they were downloaded, but only if the iOS device is jailbroken\n", "Q: How long will an Apple SSD last? Like all tools, an SSD will wear out from use and eventually fail. Are there data on roughly how long the SSD's that Apple ships in it's portable line last? \nFrom my research, it seems that the Toshiba OEM drive that comes on Apple MacBook Pros is much slower than the others on the market, but might this have an advantage in terms of longevity?\nBasically, is Apple SSD durability longer than third party drives like Crucial, OWC, or others?\n\nA: According to http://www.anandtech.com/show/6023/the-nextgen-macbook-pro-with-retina-display-review/10, at least the new Retina MacBook Pros are equipped with an OEM version of the Samsung 830 series SSDs. Therefore their lifetime ratings should be similar. Regarding the performance of a filled SSD drive, have a look at http://www.anandtech.com/show/4863/the-samsung-ssd-830-review/6.\n\nA: A simplified answer to SSD lifetime would be:\nSSD is a Semiconductor device built to last a minimum of 10 years. Some of us still have computers from year 2000 or even before, thus older than 14 years.\nWith that said, looking closer at the SSD, it is a flash memory type semiconductor device and could develop leaking currents (means the cells lose their charge (memory).\nThere is difference in life (quality) of SSD's depending on manufacturer (Intel, Samsung etc.). To my knowledge, Intel is still the front runner on quality = life time, but Samsung is chasing them. It is really difficult to say who is the best, but one can use the warranty as a guide. For example Samsung gives 5 Years on the 840 model. That means it will last minimum 7-10 years, otherwise they would be out of business replacing all dead SSD's.\nJust to clarify, I am talking about the most common type of SSD (using the Single layer memory cells), the dual layer lasts even longer but it is much more expensive.\nApple, Crucial, OWC etc. do NOT make the actual memory chips. The buy them from Semiconductor manufacturer like Samsung or Intel etc. and make the SSD boards with their name on it.\nHowever, do not panic, the drives have a self repair capability!\nThey do that by simply replacing the dead cells.\nThe problem is there is limited supply (reserve) of new cells.\nOne of the biggest life limiting factor is the amount of data stored. Let's say when the SSD is 90% full, it will become a problem soon, since the drive tries to rotate the cells to preserve/avoid memory leakage.\nSecond life factor is the daily usage (read/write). Again, do not panic, a \"normal\" user will never see that problem.\nAll in all the SSD should last you longer than your computer screen or keyboard!\nSSD are sensitive to heat (as any Semiconductor device) and will lose life if operated at elevate environment temperatures, means they love cold environment. Does not mean you have to move to Alaska :).\nJust to give you an idea. Why do you think Intel invented the so called \"I\" processors they call it Intelligent CPU. Great Marketing by the way. The actual reason is the CPU becomes too hot if it operates at 100% all the time.\nSame applies to the SSD chips, so keep them cool and do not overload your drive and it will last and last.\nAnd!, try not to use too much of the SSD health test softwares.\nThat just stresses you SSD unnecessarily.\nIt would be the same if you would constantly go to a doctor to verify if you're healthy and he would give you an Xray scan each time, just to tell you you are fine (but too much Xray exposure will kill you).\n\nA: From personal experience my SSD in a 2012 MacBook Pro Retina just failed on me after 2 years. Luckily I opted for AppleCare as I have no chance to repair this particular model myself without spending nearly thousand dollars on parts. \nMy first SSD I ever used was an Intel SSD 2nd Gen which failed after four years. Warranty time was three years with the dealer.\nUnlike traditional hard drives there were no signs it would die soon so it is even more important to have current backups.\nI would say it is safe to assume that electronics are made to last just a bit longer than the warranty it comes with. No matter which company it sells.\n\nA: I arrived at this question hoping to find a definitive answer myself but it seems like there are so many factors which affect the answer of how long an SSD lasts - the answer is not simple.\nAlthough I could not find information on the specific type of SSD used by Apple (in my Macbook Pro say), I was able to find some of the key factors.\nThought it would be useful to post here as a starting point to getting a fuller answer.\nFactors:\n\n\n*\n\n*NAND type used - from a Drivesavers YouTube invo video I gleaned this info\nThe durability of SSD very much depends on what type of NAND Flash it has, i.e. SLC vs MLC vs EMLC vs TLC.\nHe says that the newer version - TLC NAND - is being used in some Samsung consumer products and has a programme erase limit of 1-2k per cell (which is tiny compared to the old SLC 100k writes limits).\nHowever, Samsung are doing pro enterprise grade versions with EMLC NAND - giving 30k writes per cell.\nMost commonly, write limits of 2 - 3k per cell are quoted for 2D MLC flash. This was apparently the vast majority of flash type used in 2014.\nBut not sure 100% that this type of NAND is used by Apple.\n\n*Compression \nThe more data written to the drive the more write cycles used up, so the amount of usage of the drive will also be determined partly by the effectiveness of the compression baked into the drive controller.\nThere's an article discussing the improvement in lifespan which results from better compression on SSD drives particularly the Sandforce controller:\nFrom other research I can see that some, but not all, Macbook Air machines, for example, had Sandforce controllers.\n\n*It also depends on the endurance architecture used by the designer \n\n\"the longevity difference between \"good enough\" and the best endurance architecture schemes can still be 2x, 3x or 100x - even when using the same memory\" \n\nSo not totally answering the question but hopefully enabling getting closer to the answer, e.g. if we can get hold of a list of Apple models with their various SSD types and then take into account the above factors.\n\nA: it has all been explained so well in the earlier posts, but my guts feeling tells me that for the quick reader the inherent criticality may not have fully come across.\nSo please forgive if i repeat most of the above statements, i just would like to try to put them into am more hands-on perspective.\nLack of information\nYou can't really estimate the endurance of your built in SSD until the manufacturer of the laptop lets you know which make/model/type of drive. \nIn this situation you can't even guess how capable these drives are of self-recuperating worn out cells.\nThe warranty only tells you, how long your drive (or mainboard, if soldered on) will be replaced at no cost, not how long your data is secure.\nUntypical behaviour\nConsumers buying notebooks are typically not aware of a critical SSD specific, when they think of SSD drive failures in the same way as of components like screens or touchpads would fail:\n\n\n*\n\n*Sure, SSDs also fail statistically driven, like ordinary conponents (screens, monitors, ...). For example because the SSD-controller fails.\nThis is covered by the other measure for reliability, which is referred to as \"MTBF\".\nBut this is unrelated to the question of drive wear.\nAnd this kind of failure is typically extremely rare.\n\n*More relevant for the consumer is the fact that it is not the question IF SSDs will fail, but rather WHEN they fail.\nI.o.w.: SSDs fail with approx. 100% likelehood, as soon as they are worn out.\nI.e.: when data has been written to it for a technically determined total count and amount of data, specified by the manufacturer's choice at design time, by design.\nThis fact is covered in the measure referred to as \"DWPD\".\nThis divergence is why i believe that the failure behaviour of SSDs and it's specific criticality is typically misunderstood by typical consumers.\nAdding to that criticality (1): \nif one or few cells are failing without being recuperated by the automatic background wear-leveling in time, it may render the entire drive lost, not just the affected \"cells\". \nWhich is opposed to what one got accustomed to back in the days of HDDs (magnetic hard drives with spinning platters), which often died stepwise, only partially at the beginning and over a prolongued period, thus far more predictable and manageable.\nAdding to that criticality (2): \nnotebooks with soldered on drives have often been sold with small disks (128, 256 GB; this seems to change these days in end of 2019), because bigger disks were unproportionally expensive. \nThis fact will substantially aggravate the wear situation, as have been pointed out above: \nbecause users need that scarce space for their conent files they actually work with (and not just for the operating system and the applications), they have often utilised the drive storage capacity over 70% or more, which reduces the reserve for the wear-leveling mechanisms to do their healing job, which results in drive failures getting more likely.\nEndurance is expensive\nSSDs differ hugely in their endurance, as anybody can look up when comparing the respective measure \"DWPD\", often mentioned in the fine print of the tech specs of the drive. \nThis tells you \"exactly\" how much data you can write how often to this drive until it is dead (where \"exactly\" actually means: \"statistically significantly\"). \nAnd looking up this specification unveils to which extent drive endurance correlates with price, which in turn allows to estimate what to expect from undocumented drives built into products which are designed for the average user, average use cases and average product life time, which is most likely not synonymous with \"enterprise\" use (as in \"Enterprise SSD drives\", which are those special build long lasting SSDs aimed for servers and storage systems). \nIn this context, i deem any notebook product labeled as \"Pro\" to be member of the \"average\"-camp, not \"enterprise\".\nTargeted use cases\nFinally to put the likelihood of SSD failure into the hands-on perspective:\nAs said above by the earlier posters: the more often cells have to change their state, i.e.: the more frequent you change data, the earlier the drive is worn out, which can be substantially earlier then the specified warranty period.\n\n\n*\n\n*User type A:\nIf your disk capacity is used by data to a typical degree, and your are regularly doing data intensive work, such as video editing of FullHD/2K/4k videos, or photo editing of full frame sensor photos, or recording music, and postprocess these media files (like cutting, changing compression level, adjusting color hue, ...), you are not that \"average user\" who may be safe to found their expectation for the drive longevity on the warranty specification of the disk (which is the least relevant criterion by the way).\nInstead you are the type of user which is also targeted by the \"creator's laptops\" marketing campaign these days.\n\n*User type B:\nIf instead you are a gamer, or work with text documents and spreadsheets most of the time, you don't have to worry about the longevity aspect of your SSD.\nConclusion \nWhen weighing the fact of SSDs soldered on to mainboards, think of it like you would consider buyng a car with undetachable tires. \nAnd in order to estimate the resell value of your investment, possibly also ask yourself whether you would buy such a device second handed.\nAll of this will matter only until SSD technology will have improved the endurance enough to put the situation out of it's criticality. \nBut for consumer grade drives that is not today, in late 2019.\n", "Q: Use old iPod touch screen So I have a cracked ipod touch 4 Gen screen. Is there any use for this now? Is there possibly a way to get an adapter to HDMI or something similar? The screen works fine besides the cracked glass. \n\nA: Apple (Wal-mart, Best buy, and others carry it also) does sell 30 pin to HDMI. If you have an Apple TV you could stream via Airplay.\nIf you are adventurous you could try to replace the screen and digitizer, I did a quick search on Amazon and came up with multiple prices above and below twenty dollars. For directions search Youtube or iFixit.\n\nA: *\n\n*You can sell it to Gazelle for some cash. \n\n*You could buy a replacement screen on iFixit and replace it yourself.\n\n*I have seen many people with severely cracked screens just live with it.\n\n", "Q: How to close all windows of Mac OS X Finder? Having 30 or 40 windows of different folders open, is there any way to close all of them at once? I tried to relunch Finder, and I was happy for a second having no open window anymore, but it reopened all the folder windows again :-)\n\nA: Yes, you can use the shortcut ⌥ option + ⌘ command + W.\n\nA: A sidenote on this: Often such commands are not visible in the main menu if you just click it. However, if you press ⌥ while the menu is open, then the menu will change to view the alternate feature.\nAnother example: \nFile > Get Info ⌘I\n \nwill turn into File > Show Inspector ⌥⌘I\n\nonce you press ⌥.

However in some cases we like to cut them when only the source folder is  open, and paste them later.\n\nA: While you can copy (Command + C) and paste (Command  + V) files in OS X, the cut (Command + X) function is not supported.  What you can do however is choose whether to Move, Copy, or Create an alias when dragging and dropping files.  \n\n\n*\n\n*Command + Drag and Drop = Move File\n\n*Option (alt) + Drag and Drop = Copy File\n\n*Option + Command + Drag and Drop = Create Alias\n\n\nAs a side note, when working with files all on the same Volume/Partition Move is the default action, there is no need to hold the Command Key.  Alternately, when working with files across two different Volume/Partitions, Copy is the default option and there is no need to hold the option key.  You can always tell what is about to happen by taking a look at the curser before you drop.  A green Plus (+) icon indicates that the file will be copied, the absence of this icon indicates a move.\nIf the Cut and Copy functionality is absolutely crucial to your workflow, then I suggest checking out OnMyCommand. It's a Unix and AppleScript Executor and if I recall, there are some user submitted scripts that will enable cut functionality for finder items.\n\nA: The shortcuts to Cut and Paste files or folders in Lion (or later) are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Command-C to copy \n\n*Command-Option-V to paste\n\n", "Q: How to start preview from command line and get back to the terminal when I press ESC?

First of all, I know I can manually configure the firewall through IPFW but I hope that the OS X firewall system has an option for this by default.\nThe problem I am currently having is that when I'm doing web development with Django I get a 'Do you want the application \"python\" to accept incoming netowrk connections?' every time I save a file within the project.\nNote that I need Django to be available throughout the local network since I usually use multiple computers during development (i.e. IE box to test) so I cannot set it to localhost only.\nIs there any way to have OS X remember this \"Allow\" permanently instead of asking every time I save a file?\n\nA: The dialog is not coming from ipfw but from socketfilterfw, the OS X Application based firewall. That one is not port based, like ipfw but based on processes. If an application/script wants to bind a port the application firewall checks it's ruleset and subsequently asks the user if that should be allowed which is what you already see. If you allow this, the binary in question gets signed and is allowed access in the future without user interaction. If the binary changes, you get asked again.  \nThe only way to prevent getting asked is to turn off the app firewall which I do not recommend. Alternatively you could start signing each change of your python files which is likely to become annoying.\nSidenote: If you need a port based firewall as well you should be using pf (pf.conf(5), pfctl(8)) on Mountain-Lion as ipfw is deprecated.\n", "Q: iPhone 4S unlock and/or jailbreak? I have seen there are several jailbreak and unlocks are available for earlier models. \nIs there any trusted unlock and/or jailbreak available for iPhone 4S?\nI am not sure about the iOS version as I don't have the phone in my hands now. \nIf your answer provides information which versions can be safely unlocked and/or jailbroken (with links to the instructions) and which are not would be amazing.\n\nA: The Absinthe tools are really easy to use - jailbreaking has gotten much easier than it used to be. However, the dev teams are hard at work on getting their tools to work with the latest iOS version/chip version combinations so it's hit or miss with if you will actually be able to do it.\nAbsinthe is currently only compatible with 5.0.1 and 5.1.1 (you can see greenpois0n.com for a bit of info).\nOne thing to look out for is that it can be confusing but being that you have a 4S that narrows it down a bit - you will probably need to wait until they update Absinthe to jailbreak, unless you are fortunate enough to not have updated the firmware yet.\nOn the subject of unlocking, that's a different story - in case you're not sure of the difference, unlocking means being able to use different carrier SIM cards where as jailbreaking means being able to use non approved apps (it's a common mistake, so that's why I mention it here).\nUnlocking can be done a few different ways (in the US, I'm unsure exactly the process in other countries). In the US, Sprint WorldWide customer service will unlock your phone if your account has been in good standing for 90 days (I've had 5 iPhones unlocked this way) and as long as there are no other holds on your account. AT&T will unlock a 4S that isn't on contract (I'm unsure if it has to be an AT&T phone originally) and I think Verizon Wireless has a similar policy (but I don't know for certain).\nOne thing you will want to watch out for are street vendors that say they can unlock your iPhone - they can't, don't waste your money.\niClarified actually has a pretty good walkthrough wizard for both unlocking and jailbreaking here:\nhttp://iclarified.com/unlock/index.php (unlocking)\nand\nhttp://iclarified.com/jailbreak/index.php (jailbreaking)\nHope that helps.\nCheers!\n\nA: This site has some good information on jailbreaking, and as far as I can tell, it's only doable with iOS 5.0.1 and 5.1.1, and nothing greater than that. \nUnfortunately I cannot speak from experience, as I have never had a 4S. But I can tell you that iOS 6 is not able to be jailbroken for any device that's not running the A4 chip ATM, and definitely not an untethered jailbreak yet.\n\nA: Try Lifehacker's \"Always-Up-To-Date\" Guide for Jailbreaking iPhones. They recommend using greenpois0n Absynthe which easily jailbreaks a 4S running 5.0.1. \nThat's the best I'll be able to do for you without knowing the actual version of iOS you're running. \n\nA: Unlocking your iPhone is completely legal if you purchased the device unsubsidised or have finished paying for your contract. However, if you're still paying for your contract, you technically don't own the iPhone yet, so you really should check with your carrier before unlocking it. \n\nA: In addition to software Jailbreak/Unlock solution, there are low-price hardware solutions also: The small chips that are put on the sim card and make any sim card to appear as the correct sim card to iPhone. \nYou can buy the suitable ones in eBay with names like GPP unlock sim card or something like this.

I close the lid at night to put it in sleep mode, and when I open it the next day, the display backlight doesn't turn on – I just get a black screen.\nI know the computer itself is powered on because I can hear the fans running, and I know it's not in sleep mode because the sleep indicator light turns off when I open the lid. It's exactly as if you lowered the brightness to 0.\nI tried adjusting the brightness, hitting all sorts of keys, etc. and nothing gets the display to come back – so I've resorted to holding the power key to force it off, then booting it back up.\nIs there anything I can do, or is this a hardware failure? Surprised as the machine is only 3 years old (though it's my employer's, not mine!).\n\nUPDATE: I have an external monitor hooked up to the MacBook, and when the MacBook's display fails to turn back on after waking from sleep, the external monitor also doesn't display anything – just the default \"no signal\" message that appears when the monitor is on but not plugged into a computer.\nIf this were an issue with the MacBook's internal display cable (as it seemed like it was), would that also prevent the external monitor from displaying anything?\n\nA: Make sure you are using the laptop with the correct model magsafe charger - if you use a different model's charger, eg a 15 inch 85 watt charger or such, it can cause this problem to occur. A reset of the PRAM would normally cure the problem temporarily.\n\nA: This sounds like a hardware problem, if using the brightness keys on the keyboard have no effect.\nHave you tried resetting PRAM? (Hold down command+option+P+R while rebooting) This is the first thing that Apple will have you do if you bring it to them.\nOne suggestion, if you get the backlight on, don't close the lid, put the computer to sleep using the shutdown dialog box, and see if that helps. If it does, then it is probably a bad video cable.\n\nA: I have the same problem and have found that if you repeatedly hit the ESC button, eventually the backlight will turn on. \n\nA: I found a temporary fix. Set a hot corner for sleep mode, you can do this in the System Preferences app. \nWhen you open your MacBook, type your password while the screen is still black; press return. This should send you into your desktop while the screen is still black. Then move your cursor to your sleep mode hot corner, an then move it away. This should wake up your back light without you going through the trouble of restarting or resetting your PRAM. \nI've had this same problem for quite a while and I just learned to live with it.\n\nA: I got this issue when I updated my MacBook to 10.10.3. There was no backlight on Apple Logo. The screen was showing blank.\nOn reading above posts, It was cleared that there is an issue with screen light. I tried my iPhone Flash on back of Macbook Screen on Apple logo and found very blurred Login Page, where I entered password and hit enter. After some time it loaded my screen. It was horrible experience. Never seen such issues, Hope apple fixes this issue.\n\nA: This probably might be late. But I hope it solves the problem for future generations.

This stops you from viewing any warnings or notifications on the battery or power status. When your system shuts down in this setting, your are probably facing the black screen issue.\nNow when this happens, as a user, we would have tried to press and hold the power button and at times, it could trigger a restart taking you to the Recovery mode with three options\n\n*\n\n*Forgot password\n\n*Password doesnt work\n\n*Keyboaord doesnt work.\n\nSolution: In the left top click the Apple menu and shut down the system. Now that your system is shut down. Its time to power it up. On the assumption that We still don't see anything on the monitor, leave the system for about a couple of minutes. Now think of how you normally login to the system and how many login users you normally see and which one is yours.\nFor example: Check the below image as example [Image downloaded from Apple forums]\n\nWe are going to follow the below steps assuming your display is still black and you are in the login process rather than the recovery process.\nStep 1 : Click the right arrow button. This focuses you to the first user in the system\nStep 2: Based on the user you normally login, click the right arrow and focus on your login.\nStep 3 : Click enter.\nStep 4 : Enter your password\nStep 5: Click enter again\nLeave the machine for a couple of minutes... Hurray, you might be able to see your screen!\nIt's important you know which user you are and your password. If it doesn't work, try switching it OFF and ON, and follow the steps again with a different user (Step 2).\n", "Q: Is it possible to turn on \"read receipts\" in iMessage for just certain contacts? I am wondering if it is possible to specify which of my contacts will see if I have read their messages. I know I can turn on \"send read receipts\" in iMessage but that allows everyone to see if I have read their messages. I would really like it if there was some way to just have certain of my friends see that I have read their messages.\n\nA: I don't believe this is possible at this time. Read receipts in iMessage appears to be an all-on or all-off option only.\n\nA: This is core iOS functionality. Aside from looking for jailbreak-community mods (which may or may not exist) or writing your own modification (would require jailbreak) you're gonna have to wait for Apple to decide to include this feature (which they may never).\n\nA: Individual read receipt assignment is coming in iOS 9, for what it's worth.\n", "Q: How do I generate cryptographically random numbers on OSX? I need to generate several cryptographically random numbers in OSX and save it to a text file.\nHow should I go about doing this?\n\nA: The /dev/random file on OS X is fairly good since it uses the Yarrow algorithm which many consider to be fairly secure in generating random numbers.\nYou can use dd to pull a character at a time off the stream and as long as you use caution in converting it into a number range you care to see in your text file, this is a fairly painless way to get some decent randomness.\ndd if=/dev/random bs=1 count=1 2>/dev/null >> /path/to/your/file\n\n", "Q: Does Coda 2 support Markdown?

I am actually using the sweidsh keyboard with an estonian layout, so the backtick key itself produces ' and while holding Shift, it produces –.\nIs there maybe a way to create a global keyboard shortcut?\n\nA: Looking through the keybindings in the Estonian keyboard layout that ships with Mac OS X, it appears (amazingly) that the backtick character (`) cannot be produced with any of the unmodified keys, nor with any combination of option, shift, or control, despite the fact that most of the option-character key combinations are left unmapped on this layout. There are many ways to modify it to produce this key combination.\nYou could create a modified Estonian layout using Ukelele, you could use a program like Keyboard Remap for Macbook, or even TextExpander.\n\nA: Sadly, this glaring issue still hasn't been addressed in the last 7+ years.  \nThere is a Ukulele-based keyboard layout bundle available on Github that's straightforward to use:\nCaret is mapped to ⌥Ä, as is common on Windows workstations.\nBacktick is unironically mapped to ` — the key exists on the physical keyboard, the native layout just doesn't use it that way.\n\nTo install it:  \n\n\n*\n\n*download the keyboard bundle from Github  \n\n*sudo mv ~/Downloads/EstonianDev.bundle /Library/Keyboard\\ Layouts/  \n\n*restart\n\n*change your keyboard layout to \"Estonian Dev\" from Preferences → Keyboard → Input Sources → +.\n\n", "Q: Way to tell where a password dialog is coming from? Sometimes a piece of software will automatically update itself, and I'll abruptly get the \"type your password to allow this\" dialog. Is there any verification going on behind the scenes before the OS gives me this dialog? It seems like any random trojan could tell the OS that it's called \"Update Adobe Flash Player\" or something else official-sounding. For that matter, is there anything stopping a malicious program from popping up a dialog that looks just like the OS X one? \nI'm aware that programs shouldn't be able to do this unless I've knowingly put them on my computer, so the burden is on me to be careful about what software I download in the first place (barring discovery of new OS exploits, which is likely to happen at some point). I'd like to know whether there's any additional verification I could do so that even if malware does get onto my system, I can at least avoid giving it an admin password. \n\nA: In System Preferences you go to Security and Privacy.\nCode signing is a component of this.  Choosing Mac App Store and Identified developers requires the use of Code Signing certificate.  If you want to be able to install anything unsigned, you will have to select \"Anywhere.\"  This allows you to install anything, but it allows you to install anything :) See this pic:\n\n", "Q: Looking for GSview for OSX Does anyone know where I can find a copy of GSview that will run on OSX?\nI have already tried the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*I searched for a Homebrew recipe for GSview, but I didn't find one.  (BTW, I already have the ghostscript-9.05 recipe installed; AFAICT, this recipe did not include GSview.)\n\n*I downloaded a copy of MacGSView_2.0b3_Installer.bin, but when I click on it, an error message tells me that it can't be opened because \"the Classic environment is no longer supported.\"\n\n*I downloaded the source code, hoping to be able to build the executable, but AFAICT the download does not include any instructions or scripts for installing under OS X (or even under Unix).  More precisely, the little Unix-oriented information I was able to find in the download seems to be entirely obsolete, since it mentions files names that do not remotely resemble the files in the downloaded zip file, etc.  (A set of instructions for building and installing the app from the contents of this download would be an entirely acceptable answer to this question.)\n\n*all the hits I get when I Google for GSview OSX, even those that include the string \"OSX\" or \"OS X\" in the title, are actually for Windows executables.\n\n\nA: You could try MacGhostView:  \nhttp://www.kiffe.com/macghostview.html \nIf you have Mountain Lion, you will also have to install XQuartz:\nhttp://xquartz.macosforge.org/landing/\n", "Q: Disable dictionary results in Spotlight? How can I remove dictionary results from Spotlight results?

I've noticed that my time capsule continually whirs away and never seems to take any down time. This can't be good for the drives or for my power bill!\nIs there any way to manually force the time capsule to go into sleep mode, powering down the hard drives and awaiting instructions?\nCheers, P.\n\nA: The Time Capsule is part wireless router and part hard drive. The wireless-part is always on, and creates a constant low humming from the fans, there isn't really anything you can do about that, other than unplugging it whenever it's not needed. If it's part of a larger WiFi-network and can be spared at some hours, that might be an option.\nThe hard drive's fans are a bit louder because it needs more cooling. The TC is meant to be silent when the disk isn't being accessed, and it shuts down the disk automatically after 5 minutes or so (not exact) of disk inactivity.\nIf your TC is constantly whirring like the disk is being used, make sure it isn't! If it isn't, you could try unplugging it from the power for a few seconds and turn it on again and see if that helps. If it doesn't help, there might be an issue with the disk and it's fans, and you might want to contact Apple for technical support.\nI can't think of a way to manually putting it to sleep or power down the hard drives, other than disconnecting the disk from all your computers (AirPort Utility 5.6 has a nifty button for this under Disks).\n", "Q: Getting Music NOT purchased from iTunes, from an old computer to new computer I am trying to get my music NOT purchased from itunes into a new itunes/computer (the music I purchased from iTunes is on the new computer). i authorized it but keep getting an error message that says \"authorization is needed to access \"insert song name here\".\ni tried previously posted settings to get the autofill there to see if that works, and when i hit \"apply\" i get a message saying \"The iPhone “Denise's iPhone” is synced with another iTunes library.

In fact I want just the opposite. how can i get this music off an older phone/computer, onto an new computer (not just shared), then on to my new iphone?\n\nA: There are (at least) two simple ways of achieving this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Select the songs in iTunes and drag them to a folder in the Finder. Copy said folder to the other computer (via WiFi, external drive, Disk Target Mode, whatever). Drag files out of folder and drop on iTunes.\n\n*iTunes Match. For a cost of $25 per year, you can store all your music in iCloud. Whether you bought said music from iTunes, or ripped it from CD, or got it from anywhere. Then you can access it from all your devices - iPhones, iPads, Macs, iPod Touches, AppleTVs - anything that can see iCloud.\n\n\nA: Get a high speed - solid state drive (that includes USB thumb sticks) or hard drive. And use this to transfer the files. iTunes should accept them fine if they have no DRM. iTunes have removed DRM from many songs recently (AFAIK).\n", "Q: MacBook Air: Can't connect to my TP-Link wifi router I have a MBA 13\" mid 12, OS X 10.7.5. It often completely ignores my Wi-Fi network, not showing it in the list of available networks (my Linux boxes and Android devices are connecting perfectly). \nI tried to remove my network from the list of known networks, rebooted my router and notebook many times, tried to change encryption standards (now it uses 802.11b/g, WPA/WPA2, TKIP), but network still was not visible. \nMy router is TP-Link TL-WR340GD.\n\nA: After long experimenting I've changed my Wi-Fi channel settings on the router from \"Automatic\" to an average value (8, in the range 1 - 13). \nNow the network is well visible.\nEd.

It has been solved by manually changing Wi-Fi channel on the router from \"Automatic\" to an average value.\nWhat channel ranges do MacBook Air's Wi-Fi NICs support? Is there a way to tweak it to a required channel not visible by default?\nP.S. My country is Ukraine and my router does have this value set.\n\nA: The manuals for all Air are stored online at http://support.apple.com/manuals/#macbookair and it looks like the latest Air is certified under the EU and Russia - but I don't see a good way to know precisely which channels are supported from a pre-sales or reference.\nYou can however, open your System Information utility and select Wi-Fi. It should show you the current Locale, Country Code and supported channels for your network adapter.\n\n\nA: I ran into a problem not seeing WiFi routers in Europe with my late 2008 Macbook.  I originally read some posts saying that U.S. models' hardware only supported the U.S. WiFi channels, but later found this was not necessarily true.\nIt turns out my laptop's WiFI does support (at least) European channels (e.g. 12 & 13) that are not supported in the U.S.  Interestingly, the way to enable usage of the proper channels (at least in Snow Leopard) was to change the region (System Preferences -> Language & Text -> Region).  (That preference displays a note: \"Changing the region may affect the availability of Internet services.\"  This seems to confirm the notion that a certain region would not let the computer see channels supported in another region.)\nYou can use the \"System Information\" tool to confirm the effects of the region selection on the network adapter .\nMost of the routers I have used while in Europe have the WiFi channel selection set to \"Auto\", and interestingly, most of the time, the routers were using channel 13, so my laptop was not seeing the WiFi station until I figured this out.\n", "Q: How is continuous play with song cues in mixtapes handled in iTunes? The question relates to something similar to cue sheets in iTunes that from my understanding is not available. However if I were to buy a continuous play DJ mix from the iTunes store it must be handled in some other way, right? \nI don't own any purchased DJ mixes from the iTunes store so I can not check this but I have a few that I have gotten from other places and it would be nice to add in song information and track cues in the mix time line. Does anyone know how Apple handles this in iTunes?\nI guess that it would also apply to podcasts and such. :)\n\nA: Jason Salaz, lost my cookie :). Yes, cue sheets are mostly (entirely?) format agnostic but their usefulness depends on the player, as it's the component that adds cue information upon playback. In case of iTunes it appears that Apple embeds this information as metadata in a m4a container. \nI tried using GarageBand to do this upon your suggestion, and it created an m4a file with embedded cue data. However GarageBand does other unrelated work, like reconverting the audio, normalizing and so on. I found an audio book editor on the Appstore that may do what I want as well, or perhaps a m4a metadata editor will as well if I find one. \n", "Q: iPhone doesn't sync over WiFi I can connect to the PC via Remote app on the iPhone, but the iPhone can't see the PC to Sync and the PC won't recognize the iPhone.

I'd like to have the same list for 5.4.\nI tried port list | grep php53- but got way too many responses...\n\nA: To show installed php extensions from port, try port installed | grep php53- or  instead of port list.\n\nA: port list shows all the ports in Macports thus giving you the large list.\nTo show all the ports you have requested try port list requested. This will only show the ports that you explicitly installed, the ones that they depend on are not shown and were installed by dependency resolution. SO this list will be the smalles list you need to reinstall the same ports. If you grep to fins php then this should give the minimum set of ports. The only issue is if there are any ports you have that depend on a php53- port but do not have php53 in the name but then I suspect there are other issues.\nAnother way is to to uninstall php53 by sudo port uninstall php53. This will fail giving the list of ports that depend on it which you have to then uninstall.

The one caveat is it costs $25 per year.\nThe second option is to sync it to your computer.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open iTunes, select the Store menu, and choose Authorize Computer.\n\n*Follow the prompts, and login with the same Apple ID that you used to purchase the music.\n\n*Plug your iPad into your computer using the USB cable that came with your iPad.\n\n*When the prompt comes up to Erase or Sync, or Transfer Purchases, select Transfer Purchases.\n\n\nSide note: Choosing the \"Erase and Sync\" option will erase any music, apps, or similar purchased content from your device, and replace it with whatever music, apps, etc. you have in your iTunes library. (It is possible to re-download those purchases, so all is not lost in that event). That is obviously undesirable so you must authorize your computer before transferring purchases. \nYou may find this Apple article helpful as well.\n\nA: Open itunes on your computer and go to the itunes store. At the bottom of the page you can look at your purchased items. Once there, the top right has a tab that says not in my library. Click that. Now you have a list of things downloaded under your apple id, but not on your device. Click download all at the bottow right of the page. It should load your purchases onto your library for you.\n", "Q: iPhone doesn't sync calendar to iCloud, calendar via iCloud.com still works I'm having a major headache inducing issue with iCloud sync. My wife and I have shared calendars for a long time and it has helped us a great deal. \nThe problem now is that my wife's iPhone has stopped syncing it's calendar with iCloud. If we log onto her account at iCloud.com and add somehting, it syncs to my iPhone as usual, but not to hers.\nIf I add something to my calendar in my iPhone or iCloud.com, it does in fact sync to her iPhone with some lag. What seems to be cut off from iCloud is her own calendar. I have tried all possible settings with iCloud and calendar app etc, nothing works. And yes, I've tried turning it off and back on again. Did a soft reset, didn't help.\nPlease, any ideas as to what can be causing this? \nRegards,\nMartin\n\nA: Try creating a new calendar within her iCloud account. Don't share it yet. Add, edit, and delete events both on her iPhone and iCloud.com through a browser. If this works as expected, share the new calendar with your iCloud account. Repeat the add/edit/delete cycle to see if changes propagate across all devices now. If this works too, use the new calendar instead of the old calendar going forward.\n\nA: I discovered what the problem was on my husband's iPhone 4. He uses iCloud as well as Gmail calendars.  When he was creating a calendar event, he didn't realize that the Gmail calendar was being used.  He could see the event on his Gmail calendar but it wouldn't sync to my iCloud calendar.  When creating an event, check below to see if you have an option to change the calendar (below the Alert).  Once he chose the iCloud email, it sync'd just fine.\n", "Q: Mountain Lion US keyboard layout .. bug?

I've created it on my MBPr, and tested it there : it works fine.\nNow when I try to boot from it in the Mac mini, I get a grey crossed-circle and the Mac mini shuts down.\nDoes anybody knows a way to fix that ?\nThanks\n\nA: You can hold down the keys [cmd] + [r] while the mini is shut down and then push the power button. This should lead you to the recovery via the Mac App Store.\nTake a look at:\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/HT4718?viewlocale=en_US&locale=en_US\n\nA: The crossed circle means you are trying to launch an unsupported version of Lion.You'll need the right version, best to Format/Reinstall via the Lion Internet Recovery function by pressing cmd+option+r on startup.\nIf this doesn't work, you may need to reformat and wipe the drive on another machine before it can be used.\nFinally if all else fails it could be a hardware incompatibility, try and remember if you've changed anything recently, it could seem innocuous at first but little things can make big problems.\n", "Q: Alternative to APLAY for Mac OS X bash Anybody knows any Mac alternative for Linux's APLAY program? I would like to run this script:\necho \"main(i){for(i=0;;i++)putchar(((i*(i>>8|i>>9)&46&i>>8))^(i&i>>13|i>>6));}\" | gcc -x c - && ./a.out | aplay\n\nWhich makes great sound effect, but I don't know how, since Mac OS doesn't have aplay.\nEDIT:\nLink to Wikipedia, which describes the functionality of aplay.\n\nA: I believe the sox utility stands in for aplay.\n\nA: \nI know that this topic is old, but I've find a recent working solution. SOX doesn't support input from stdout anymore so now a working alternative is mplayer. You'll need to install it using Hombrew.sh with brew install mplayer. \nYou can then replace aplay by:\nmplayer -cache 1024 -quiet -rawaudio samplesize=1:channels=1:rate=8000 -demuxer rawaudio -\nJust be sure to change rate=8000 with your custom frequency.\nYou can create an alias in ~/.bashrc for aplay to pipe your PCM chiptune in like this:\nalias aplay=\"mplayer -cache 1024 -quiet -rawaudio samplesize=1:channels=1:rate=8000 -demuxer rawaudio -\"\nHope this helped, tested on macOs Sierra 10.12.5 today.\n\nA: aplay needs ALSA which is only available on Linux. You could try outputting that bytestream to a file and try to play with afplay on OS X. (You likely need to add proper AIFF headers for afplay to accept the file since it won't play a raw PCM dump (or however that bytestream coming out of that echo should be interpreted).)\n\nA: I used mpv. The options are similar to mplayer, but the --rawaudio switch is no longer supported in mpv. This is what you do instead:\necho 'c_program' | gcc and crap | mpv --cache=1024 --quiet \\\n    --demuxer=rawaudio \\\n    --demuxer-rawaudio-format=u8 \\\n    --demuxer-rawaudio-channels=1 \\\n    --demuxer-rawaudio-rate=8000 -\n\n\nA: Install sox from Homebrew, then use play -c1 -b8 -eunsigned -traw -r8k - instead of auplay.\n\nA: Here is the same program, as a perl one-liner, which works (tested) on Mac, Linux, and Windows\nperl -e 'for($i=0;;$i++){\n    print pack(\"n\", ((($i*($i>>8|$i>>9)&46&$i>>8))^($i&$i>>13|$i>>6))); \n}' | ./play -c 1 -b 8 -e unsigned -t raw -r 8k -\n\nthe \"./play\" command is the \"sox\" utility already mentioned in this article. \n\nA: I already had ffplay installed as part of ffmpeg, so this was what worked most easily for me:\necho \"main(i){for(i=0;;i++)putchar(((i*(i>>8|i>>9)&46&i>>8))^(i&i>>13|i>>6));}\" \\\n    | gcc -w -x c - && ./a.out | ffplay -f s16le /dev/stdin\n\nSee\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/28174639/how-can-i-play-raw-pcm-file-that-i-dumped-from-a-codec\n\nA: macOS includes a command named afplay, which plays an audio file to the default audio output.\nTo play a file, simply run:\nafplay <audiofile>\n\n", "Q: Sync google apps (gmail) contacts directory with Mac address book We use Gmail (Google Apps for business) at my work.\nI have set up my Mac (OS X 10.7.5) address book to sync the local address book with my gmail account, however this only syncs \"My Contacts\" but all my work contacts are in a group named \"Directory\" (a readable LDAP style group). I would like to sync my Mac address book with the Directory group but I can't find a way to do this.\nI thought I had achieved a similar effect by dumping all the contacts from the directory into My Contacts, but it seems that only the email addresses are in My Contacts and the rest of the information is shown by being linked to the original Directory entry - therefore only email addresses are synced to the address book with no further information (e.g. addresses, telephone numbers...)\nIs there a way to achieve this?\n\nA: There is no direct way to get all the contacts from the directory directly to your Mac. If you open the section in the Contacts Mac OS application, it will never list its entire content but only let you search.\nHowever, there is an easy workaround:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the Contacts web interface https://www.google.com/contacts\n\n*On the sidebar, find the Directory option. The entire content will now appear. \n\n*Select all the entries. \n\n*Add these to a group, i.e. \"Corp. Directory\"\n\n\nNow, all these contacts will be imported to \"My Contacts\" and will be synched to the Mac.  \n\nA: You can sync all your Gmail contacts to your Address Book on MAC.\nOpen Address Book Preferences and then open the Accounts tab.\nAccount Type must be CardDAV Account. Set your user name and password of your gmail account and finally type google.com to server address.\n\nA: I know it's a very old topic, but it appears in my searches so I'd like to share a couple of possible Solutions... what I did in my Company..\nFirst try was the creation  of an \"address book \" user,  like a service user, with its contacts periodically updated from the domain Directory: this user  was add in each smartphone or device in order to add in the Contact App all the Directory Users like personal contacts.\nIt worked great,but it needed manual job, and potentially a user could change one of these contacts.\nSecond try was this app: ShareDirectory Contacts ( https://gsuite.google.com/marketplace/app/sharedirectory_contacts/43562572075?hl=it  ): it keeps each user contacts synchronized with the Domain Directory... I'm still testing it,but in these few weeks it seems to work well..\nI hope these two suggestions may be useful for some of you...\n", "Q: Item \"is in use by another application\". How can I find out which one? In Finder the file VirtualBox_Uninstall.tool is greyed out.\n\nI want to delete this file, but I'm prompted by a message that the file is currently in use:\n\nCurrently, I have no clue what is the cause of this. Therefore I want to know what other application is using it. How do I find this out?\n\nA: The cause is usually a copy job that unexpectedly died or some process that has an open file handle on that file. You can check which process opened which files with lsof | grep \"filename\". This will not necessarily yield a result. If the issue isn't resolved after a logout or even a restart you still can continue at that dialog and remove the file.\n\nA: There is a small application dedicated to this problem: What's keeping me\nThis provides a nice UI interface to information typically shown by the lsof command line tool.\nYou can use the UI to search for the name of the, VirtualBox_Uninstall.tool, and it will show you the process(es) that are accessing the file and offer you the ability to kill them from the UI.\n", "Q: Mail.app accidentally deleted (OS X 5.8) How do I restore Mail.app after it was accidentally deleted?\nI have complete time machine backup of system, but can't find Mail.app in it.\nI tried optional install from original disks, but Mail.app was not recognized on there -  possibly because it is out of date?\nI also tried updating Mail.app on top of original Mail.app, but that failed with an error message something like:\n\n\"Update couldn't recognize original app.\"\n\n\nA: The only way to re-install applications that are on your computer is to use your Mac OS X Install DVD (if your computer is running Mac OS X Snow Leopard or below), or Internet Recovery (if you are using OS X Lion or Mountain Lion).\nIn your case, it's Mac OS X Leopard.

I feel like this is due to touch response in the app we are using, as in, icons on springboard are aligned to a grid, maps doesn't expect constant input, etc. \nAt one point, the display seemed to loose its mind. It was registering multiple taps, responding to taps in areas we didn't tap, etc. \nI tried restoring the device, but that did not fix it.\nI figure this is a hardware issue, but not knowing too much about screens on the iPad, what would have to be replaced? Most of my searches just say 'take it to the Apple store', but I am looking to see what would have to be replaced and how much it would be, to determine if it would be worth repairing or just replacing. \nUpdate: Here is a video (not mine) that has almost the exact same issue http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=797bfjbEEi8\n\nA: Take it to the Apple store. They will not only help you be sure it's hardware but explain how they would get you an equivalent device for a known cost with Apple's warranty on the \"repaired\" iPad part. They might even be able to speculate if the case shows damage that might make a determination if it's more/less likely that you have a wiring or glass/digitizer issue.\nThen you can decide if you want to buy a used iPad and try to scavenge parts or buy a new digitizer and roll the dice to guess if it's the screen or the connector or the chipset on the main board that turns the raw signals into a touch event.\nOnce you know your \"official cost to replace\" you can decide if you want a DIY project or perhaps pay someone that repairs iPads professionally to offer a repair that might be cheaper than Apple's but have less of a warranty than getting something factory made or factory refurbished.\n\nA: Replaced my screen with a aftermarket few years ago. Started losing touch around the edges and keyboard response slowed down. Progressively got worse.Installed new aftermarket screen of which have come down in price greatly. Seems like they somehow wear out as fixed the problem. Don't know if this can happen with factory screen but fixed my situation.\n\nA: If you have a screen protecter take it off and wipe the iPad with a damp rag.\n\nA: My ipad was autocorrecting everything incorrectly to the point where I couldnt type anything.  It was getting worse quickly. I tried turning it on and off and turning off autocorrect but it didnt fix it. I took off the screen saver and wiped it. Still not working.   Finally I unplugged it and rebooted it.  That did the trick!  I had plugged it into a usb port at the airport rather than a power point to charge and was using it plugged in. Not sure if that was the problem but now I have unplugged it it is working fine so I might try turning the autocorrect back on now it is working to get my apostrophes back!\n", "Q: Changing WiFi settings separately I'm using 2 WiFi networks with my MacBook Air. I need to switch between them sometimes. The problem is one needs completely different settings from the other, and it looks like I can only make settings for the particular WiFi network I am connected to at that moment.\nIs there a way to set them separaely for specified network?\n\nA: You can create different environments for your network (System preferences --> Network) and apply different settings to these environments.\n\nIf you now switch your WiFi you can also easily change the environment (unfortunately it is not possible to do this automatically - at least not with standard tools), by clicking onto the Apple logo in the menu bar.\n\n(Sorry my OS X installation is in german language)\n", "Q: Mail app missing plug-in For some reason there are some e-mails that I get where I need to scroll down a lot to see the entire message.

Problem solved!\n", "Q: Do /etc/resolver/ files work in Mountain Lion for DNS resolution? Can anyone tell me if adding a file under /etc/resolver will work for DNS resolution using a DNS server other than what is handed out via DHCP ?\nMy issue is that I want to use OpenDNS for a clients home DNS resolution in order to take advantage of the filtering and anti scam capabilities but the massive disadvantage is that here in Australia things such as Apple content are delivered by a CDN (Akamai) which will then server content using a US based delivery point. \nWhat I want to do is have the DNS server address handed out via DHCP to be the local router address (DNSMasq using OpenDNS DNS servers) and then, for example, place a file called apple.com under /etc/resolver with the following line:\nnameserver 203.12.160.35\n\nThe idea is that any DNS request to apple.com would be resolved by a TPG (my ISP) DNS server rather than the local routers DNSMasq daemon using OpenDNS servers.\nSo I have done this and the output of scutil --dns is:\nDNS configuration\n\nresolver #1\n  search domain[0] : harland\n  nameserver[0] : 192.168.10.1\n  nameserver[1] : 192.168.10.1\n  if_index : 4 (en2)\n  reach    : Reachable,Directly Reachable Address\n\nresolver #2\n  domain   : local\n  options  : mdns\n  timeout  : 5\n  order    : 300000\n\nresolver #3\n  domain   : 254.169.in-addr.arpa\n  options  : mdns\n  timeout  : 5\n  order    : 300200\n\nresolver #4\n  domain   : 8.e.f.ip6.arpa\n  options  : mdns\n  timeout  : 5\n  order    : 300400\n\nresolver #5\n  domain   : 9.e.f.ip6.arpa\n  options  : mdns\n  timeout  : 5\n  order    : 300600\n\nresolver #6\n  domain   : a.e.f.ip6.arpa\n  options  : mdns\n  timeout  : 5\n  order    : 300800\n\nresolver #7\n  domain   : b.e.f.ip6.arpa\n  options  : mdns\n  timeout  : 5\n  order    : 301000\n\nresolver #8\n  domain   : apple.com\n  nameserver[0] : 8.8.8.8\n\nDNS configuration (for scoped queries)\n\nresolver #1\n  search domain[0] : harland\n  nameserver[0] : 192.168.10.1\n  nameserver[1] : 192.168.10.1\n  if_index : 4 (en2)\n  flags    : Scoped\n  reach    : Reachable,Directly Reachable Address\nmacbookair:resolver\n\nNow the output of an nslookup on apple.com is:\nmacbookair:resolver ilium007$ nslookup apple.com\nServer:     192.168.10.1\nAddress:    192.168.10.1#53\n\nNon-authoritative answer:\nName:   apple.com\nAddress: 17.149.160.49\nName:   apple.com\nAddress: 17.172.224.47\n\nmacbookair:resolver \n\nSo I am not using the TPG DNS server - I am still resolving against 192.168.10.1 which is the local router. Does the order of the resolvers matter ? ie. the entry created after I place the apple.com file in /etc/resolver is resolver #8:\nresolver #8\n  domain   : apple.com\n  nameserver[0] : 8.8.8.8\n\nI would really like a way to make this work - any help would be appreciated.\n\nA: This question seems a bit old, but I'm going to answer it anyways as I had a similar problem:\nYes, this works.\nYour first problem is that you obviously have the wrong IP (8.8.8.8 instead of 203.12.160.35) in /etc/resolver/apple.com. Verify that the contents of this file is really:\nnameserver 203.12.160.35\n\nThen scutil --dns should have an entry like this:\nresolver #8\n  domain   : apple.com\n  nameserver[0] : 203.12.160.35\n\nThe second problem is that you tried to verify it using nslookup which does not use the DNS resolution mechanisms of OS X. If you look at the man page of nslookup you will find this:\nMac OS X NOTICE\n   The nslookup command does not use the host name and address resolution or the DNS \n   query routing mechanisms used by other processes running on Mac OS X.  The results of \n   name or address queries printed by nslookup may differ from those found by other\n   processes that use the Mac OS X native name and address resolution mechanisms. The \n   results of DNS queries may also differ from queries that use the Mac OS X DNS routing \n   library.\n\nTo check your DNS config you could do\ndns-sd -G v4 images.apple.com\n\nand verify if it yields the same IP as \nnslookup images.apple.com 203.12.160.35\n\n\nA: Using resolver files is actually not the recommended way of doing that.\nInstead you should create DNS resolver with scutil.\nTo see all DNS queries on interface en0, open a Terminal and run:\nsudo tcpdump -n -i en0 port 53\n\nOpen another Terminal window and run:\nsudo dscacheutil -flushcache\nsudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder\nping apple.stackexchange.com -c1\n\nThe first two lines flush your DNS cache, so the system has to send out a request for sure. Why ping? ping uses the normal system APIs to resolve DNS names; unlike host, dig, and nslookup that do all DNS resolution on their own, so that they can query arbitrary DNS servers and not just those configured in the system.\nYou should see in tcpdump that your standard DNS server is queried, right?  \nWell, let's change that:\nsudo scutil\nd.init\nd.add ServerAddresses * 9.9.9.9\nd.add SupplementalMatchDomains * stackexchange.com\nset State:/Network/Service/whatever-you-want-as-long-as-unique/DNS\n\nYou can quit that interactive scutil console either with quit or by hitting CTRL+C.\nNow try the DNS flush and ping again and watch what tcpdump says. It says that 9.9.9.9 is queried! Well, check out scutil --dns:\nresolver #2\n  domain   : stackexchange.com\n  nameserver[0] : 9.9.9.9\n  flags    : Supplemental, Request A records\n  reach    : 0x00000002 (Reachable)\n  order    : 101000\n\nSee, you got a new resolver. Also note that stackexchange.com has been added to the search domain list of your primary resolver (#1). This allows you to\n# ping apple\nPING apple.stackexchange.com (151.101.65.69): 56 data bytes\n\nSweet. Now lets get rid of it again:\nsudo scutil\nremove State:/Network/Service/whatever-you-want-as-long-as-unique/DNS\n\nThat's basically it. A couple of notes:\n\n\n*\n\n*You can add multiple DNS servers and search domains separated by space,\ne.g. d.add ServerAddresses * 9.9.9.9 8.8.8.8\n\n*You can see what you've configured so far with d.show\n\n*whatever-you-want-as-long-as-unique means that every service must have a unique ID. Apple uses UUIDs for that but you can in fact really use anything as long as it won't conflict with existing services (and it cannot contain / as that's the separator character). To see what already exists, just use list and to see the content of an existing key use show <key>\n\n*Your global DNS settings, those found in /etc/resolv.conf, are in fact from scutil, checkout show State:/Network/Global/DNS. If you change that key, the content of /etc/resolv.conf will change accordingly. But you shouldn't ever do so, as this key is managed by the system and will be overwritten on various occasions (pretty much any network change, DHCP renew, etc.)\n\n*To see what other commands exist, use help.\n\n*sudo scutil is only required if you want to change keys. Reading keys is also possible as normal user.\nBTW: 9.9.9.9 is Quad9. It's like 8.8.8.8 but guarantees your privacy (no IP addresses are ever logged) and tries to protect you by not resolving known malicious domains. Whereas 8.8.8.8 logs your IP address and keeps that information for for 24 to 48 hours, see here.\n", "Q: Problems installing Ruby versions via RVM in Mountain Lion So I recently joined the Mac world and bought a MacBook - which I love, by the way.\nI'm having some trouble getting all my dev tools up setup properly and am not quite 100% familiar with the differences in the Linux CLI and the OSX CLI.\nRight now, I'm trying to install a few different versions of Ruby via RVM.\nI've tried getting gcc4.2 as I've seen recommended, but regardless of what compiler I use I get similar messages.

Online stores sell DDR3 memory from companies like Komputerbay for a fraction of the price that Kingston, Samsung, Crucial, OWC, etc. charge (not mentioning Apple OEM).\nMost reviews are good, but some people report it not working. That's not actually a problem, since Amazon will give you a refund; so the important question is:\n\n\n*\n\n*With RAM, if it works initially and passes hardware tests, does that mean it's likely that it won't have future problems?\n\n\n(Reviews only represent a fraction of the people that bought the items, so if it works right away they're likely to leave a positive one and not come back to edit it if things go wrong months or years down the line.)\n\nA: I have used RAM from \"tier 1\" vendors, as well as from \"value\" vendors like the ones that you've mentioned. I've had very few sticks \"go bad over time\" or \"just die\", but I tend to buy DIMMs (dual in-line memory module) appropriate for the application. \nThis last bit is key: RAM from a vendor who manufactures a quality product (good solder joints, board integrity, etc.) typically has problems when used outside of its intended parameters, generally defined by inconsistencies in speed, timing, and latency (the gap of time between when the computer attempts to read/write/act on the RAM and the resulting change).\nYou can install slower RAM in a faster computer. In fact, many computers tend to run slower, adjusting themselves to the RAM's timing. If you overclock any part of the system (processor, RAM, video card, etc.), the component needs to handle the additional thermal demand placed on it. RAM that cannot dissipate heat effectively enough will eventually have future problems, as the continual exposure to too much heat causes some parts to melt or degrade.\nJust because \"Vendor X\" has RAM priced at an absurdly low (or high!) price doesn't mean that it's a good deal. Just make sure the RAM meets your system's requirements. As @lupincho's comment states, using the vendor's \"configurator\" will get you the appropriate components for your system, and a much greater chance the vendor will stand behind their warranty.\n", "Q: Can you test an app before you buy it on the iPad? I want to buy an app, but don't want to waste money on something that's not gonna work for me.  Is there any way to test drive one?\n\nA: Sometimes app developers will release a version that allows you to play with it, but to get full functionality you need an in-app purchase.  See this app for Summoner Wars as an example:  https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/summoner-wars/id493752948?mt=8\nBut this is a choice the developer makes, so if the app you're interested in doesn't supply something like this (or a lite version; see @Alex's answer), then no.\n\nA: If the app developer doesn't have a free/lite version, then no.\n\nA: There is no facility for downloading a paid app as a demo or free unless the developer has an alternate delivery means. Some have review copies and/or a free version, but the store just isn't engineered to test drive an iOS app.\nYou can get someone who has purchased the app to install it on your device and in extreme cases - if you buy an app that doesn't at all match the description, you could ask Apple for a refund and document why their description doesn't match your experience. Although the store policy is no refunds - in practice, they are known to refund a purchase entirely when the reviewer didn't catch a problem and the goods were not \"as described\" when you purchased an app.\nIn this case, the shopkeeper is doing right by people that spent money based on their \"review and stocking\" process and got burned in an observable manner. You won't want to depend on this and instead be sure you are OK with spending money on something that may work as described but not meet your needs.\n\nA: *\n\n*You can always ask the author beforehand about the specific functions you are curious about.\n\n*Ask beforehand if they are willing to provide a refund if the app does not meet your needs.\n\n*There is also the illegal alternative which is to jailbreak your device and download app files from a pirate/torrent site. You can test the app without paying, then buy it if it meets your needs. There are many ethical holes with this approach, but it does allow for testing without paying upfront.\n", "Q: Double clicking the title bar of iTunes 11 does not minimize the window With Mac applications I can double click on the title bar of the application and then it will minimize. iTunes 11 lost this behaviour.\nIs there a way to restore it?\nI'm on OSX 10.6.8 and using iTunes 11.0\n\nA: This has been an annoying feature of iTunes 11. Other internet forums here and here, are already discussing the issue and as yet are without a solution. Imagine it's something that needs to be implemented by apple.\n\nA: Leave the mouse in the top right corner of the iTunes frame, your file bar should drop down with a little blue indicator showing two caddie cornered arrows pointing into each each other.\nIf this won't work, unplug your mini-display port, three finger slide left to access maximized docks and try it again.\n", "Q: Why does my Mac have Macintosh HD and Macintosh HD1? I have a VMWare virtual machine of 256GB. The HD capacity on the Mac is 750GB. In terminal under the Volumes folder, I see Macintosh HD and Macintosh HD1. About 300 gigs seem to be wasted.\nHow do I cleanup the hard drive and why do I have 2 HDs?\n\nA: When you installed your vmware, you must have partitioned your HD and allocated some storage to the virtual OS. Macintosh HD 1 is the result of a partitioned drive. If you go to disk utility you will be able to see this. I am not sure if you can undo the partition without formatting the entire drive. \n", "Q: Old iPad not charging after no use for a year I have an old iPad and want to give it to a friend.\nI plugged it in with a new lead that charges another 1st gen iPad I have, but it's not coming on.\nIt's not been used for about a year. It's been plugged in now for 20 minutes.\nAny ideas? \n\nA: If it won't wake after several hours of charging, try another charger and let it sit there for up to 8 hours.\nYou have likely let the battery self discharge to a permanently harmful level, but in most cases you can get it to trickle charge enough so that it will boot again and be of limited use depending on how long the battery was in a harmfully low voltage situation.\nIt may never boot again, but that depends more on how healthy the battery was when it entered storage since a year usually won't kill a new battery but will put a huge dent into it's usability.\n\nA: In the end it came back after a few hours charging, has worked fine ever since.\n\nA: I have a first generation iPad that I hadn’t charged in 4-6 months, it took about an hour before the battery icon came up but it’s charging just fine now.  The hard part these days is finding the old style power cord.\n", "Q: What information does iPhone 4S Log-Aggregated 2012-12-12 contain? On the iPhone under the Settings > General > About > Diagnostics & Usage Data > log aggregated, what does this mean?  \n<key>appActivationCount.com.apple.MobileSMS</key> <integer>9</integer>\n\nDoes it mean the number of text sent or received or both?\n\nA: It means that that program (the SMS application) was started 9 times on that day.\nWhether that corresponds to someone checking the app in response to a message or simply entering the app isn't logged in that file. I don't know offhand if you can reconstruct that level of detail from any of the standard logs on iOS so you may need a forensic analysis of either the database the SMS app uses or the network / server side of things to track down delivery times or even something as detailed as a daily count of SMS messages.\n", "Q: Can you charge an iPhone 5 from a standard, non-Apple Micro USB cable? Someone who has the new iPhone 5 said you can charge it from a regular Micro USB port but he's not tested it.\nCan you?\n\nA: Just to confirm what bmike said: I have one of Apple's micro-USB-to-Lightning adapters, and am using it with the cable from an Amazon Kindle. The combination works flawlessly on both the charging and data-synchronization fronts.\n\nA: Yes - just get a simple pass through adapter to plug the male USB into an adapter that fits in the lightning slot.\n\n\n*\n\n*http://store.apple.com/us/product/MD820ZM/A/lightning-to-micro-usb-adapter\nThere are also knock off and legitimate third party adapters being sold, so you can pick your price point / fit and finish / support sweet spot.\n\n\nA: Just tried with Amazon Kindle cable. iPhone charger, Kindle Cable, Apple adapter, iPhone 5s. No luck though.\niPhone says: not a certified cable, might not work flawlessly. \nit does not charge. :(\n\nA: Too scared to try as Verizon Wireless said it will fry your Iphone 5\n", "Q: Launch Daemon .plist missing. How to get it back? My system is working fine (iMac running Mountain Lion), except that when I try to import video to iMovie using the built-in iSight camera I see a message \"no camera connected\". iSight works fine in Skype, photobooth, etc.\nThe solution to this, documented here, is to trash com.apple.mio.VDCAssistant.plist at the path /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/ and it's supposed to rebuild after a restart. But when I navigate to this path, the relevant file is just not there. Restart doesn't affect it, neither does logging in with a different user account. Repairing disk permissions doesn't help. I found a file named com.apple.cmio.VDCAssistant.plist at that location but only in a Time Machine backup - it's not present on my current system.\nMy main question is: does the absence of com.apple.mio.VDCAssistant.plist indicate a deeper problem that ought to be fixed? If not, I can live with not being able to import video directly to iMovie directly from the camera.\nIf it does indicate a deeper problem, I guess it's time to reinstall the OS. If that's the case, can I restore the system from a time machine backup or will this just reintroduce the original problem?\nThanks for reading - I'd really appreciate any input.\n\nA: Update: Reinstalled the OS and the 'cmio' file is now there, though doesn't rebuild when moved. iSight still not recognised. The iSight issue must be a bug confined to older versions of iMovie, even though they're still supported by Mountain Lion. I'll use QuickTime to import the footage.\n", "Q: Exiting apps when sleeping Strange, when I'm leaving my Retina Macbook Pro alone, and it starts going to sleep (despite my setting it to not sleep), it tries to close all the apps that I have open.\nWhy would it do this and is it possible to fix it?\n\nA: It sounds like you have \"Log out after 60 minutes of inactivity\" selected in the \"Advanced…\" pane of \"Security & Privacy\" settings enabled.\n", "Q: Finder: show video thumbnail for all kind of formats/containers I wish that Finder show video thumbnail for all kind of formats and containers. *.flv doesn't get a preview, some *.mp4 not, *.mov not.\nIs this possible? Maybe a video browser in place of Finder? I have Perian installed.\n\nA: Flash Video Viewer added thumbnails for flv files and Flip4Mac for wmv files.\nI didn't find any way to add support for mkv or other formats. VLC, MPlayerX, Movist, and NicePlayer don't come with Quick Look plugins.\n", "Q: If I replace an iPod Classic battery myself, will the music be preserved? I have an iPod Classic that needs a new battery; the old battery will no longer hold a charge.  I've been told that if I send it to Apple to be fixed they will restore the device and the music will be lost.\nMy question is this: \nIf I replace the battery myself, will the music/data stay on the hard drive?\nI shouldn't have to restore it if all I do is replace the battery, right?\nI would copy all the music, but there's some older music that I want to keep that iTunes won't let me sync (something about permissions, etc).  \n\nA: The iPod classic has no NVRAM/PRAM or settings that degrade when battery power is disconnected. Unless you want to roll the risk that opening the device causes irreparable harm into the definition of \"replacing the battery\" - you are safe to go. Just like you can pull a hard drive and place it in a new computer - same with the drives in a classic iPod - everything important is on the drive.\nI would put this in the class of putting a spare tire on a car. Even if you've never done it before, you get out the manual and most people can do this themselves - especially if you are not in a rush. Likewise, those that really shouldn't attempt the operation generally have a good intuition that they are not up to the task.\nI say, dive in and replace your battery once you've read up on which connectors are fragile for your specific model. Cracking the case is by far the hardest part of the surgery.\n\nA: It may be hard to give you a concrete yes/no answer, because things always can go wrong, and even if you get the battery replaced, you may break something in the process of getting it put back together. (The replacement procedure is quite an involved ordeal, as you are likely aware).\nThat said, I found this forum which caused me to dig into it a little deeper. There is software that allows you to pull the music off of you iPod - such as CopyTrans, that may allow you to back up your iPod, if you so desire to do so. In fact, here is a whole list of software that should provide that functionality for you. Scroll up on that link, and you may find more helpful information.\n\nBack to the point: replacing the main battery shouldn't have any negative effect on your iPod. (One interesting side note: notice Apple never warns about leaving a fully discharged device too long with the risk of losing data - there are other problems that may occur if that was to happen, of course). iPods use Flash storage which is not dependent on constant power - like some types of RAM are.\nSo the short of this: you shouldn't lose data, but back it up anyway.\n\nA: Replacing the battery in your iPod Classic should not wipe any of your music or data.  All of the music and data stored on any iOS device is stored on either flash memory or in the case of the classic, an HDD.  That being said, anytime you undertake a repair like this you always run the risk of encountering some sort of error that will require you to restore the device or worse yet damaging the device and making it unusable.\nI know it's not the question you asked, but I would also suggest using a 3rd party app such as iExplorer to go ahead and back up all of the music on your device.  You should also be able to re-import that music back into iTunes and be good to continue syncing through iTunes like you always have just with all of your music safe and sound now.\n\nA: I know this sounds a bit like an anti-answer, but I'd suggest that getting around the iTunes permission issue with your older music would be easier than changing the battery yourself.\n", "Q: VPN Changes Hostname When I connect to various VPN servers (Windows PPTP, Cisco IPSEC) the hostname of my laptop gets updated.\nIs there a setting somewhere that will stop this from happening?\n\nA: This question is a manifestation of the same situation described in question Why is my host name wrong at the Terminal prompt when connected to a public WiFi network?, and the answer https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/127405/17600 explains the cause and the solution.  Copying from that answer:\n\nType in Terminal:\nscutil --get HostName\n\nIf there's no HostName available, what you see is probably coming from\n  the DNS or DHCP server.\nSet your HostName with:\nsudo scutil --set HostName 'yourHostName'\n\nThat should do it.\n\n\nA: The VPN's DHCP server probably assigns hostname together with the IP address and the computer uses it instead of what you've set during setup and what appears in System Preferences -> Sharing -> Computer name. \nTo set a permanent hostname do \nsudo scutil --set HostName DesiredHostname in Terminal.app (there are also ComputerName and LocalHostName that can be changed there).\nRestart may be required.\n", "Q: How to figure out what app is beeping at me? Every now and then, on my Mac, I hear a bell.  I have no idea what app it is, or why it's beeping at me.\nMy first thought was that it's coming from the Notification System in OS X 10.8 (I never heard such a thing on 10.7), but I turned off the sound notifications for every app listed in the Notification preferences.\nIs there any way to tell what app is doing this to me?\nUPDATE: I think it might have been Mail -- it has its own sound notification preferences, apparently.  But I'm not certain, and the question as written still stands: how do you know where sound comes from?\n\nA: I don't believe there's an easy, general way to determine exactly what process is making a sound, but if I had to track it down, I'd use an \"audio router\" (E.G., http://jackosx.com/about.html) and reroute each process/application one at a time until I figured out which was causing the sound.\n", "Q: Can a RAM module not be compatible with Macs? There are DDR3 RAM modules sold on Amazon (branded by KomputerBay) where it is specified that they are \"PC only\" and not for Mac. They cost around £41.99 ($68).\nThe same company has modules with the same exact technical specifications on Amazon, called \"for Apple\" RAM. They cost significantly more £53.99 ($87).\nApart from the $20 price jump, what could be different? Is this a scam to make Apple users pay more?\n\nHere are the specifications of both the \"PC only\" and \"MacMemory\" RAM from KomputerBay:\n\n\n*\n\n*PC3-12800 (1600MHz)\n\n*Gold leads\n\n*Supports Dual Channel\n\n*DDR3\n\n*204 Pin\n\n*Laptop memory upgrade\n\n*Non-ECC\n\n*Non-Parity\n\n*Unbuffered\n\n*Density: 16GB (2x 8GB SO-DIMM)\n\n*Timing: 10-10-10-27 (1600 MHz)\n\n*Speed: 1600MHz CL10\n\n*Pin Out: 204 Pin\n\n*1.5V\n\n*Lifetime Warranty\n\n\nA: Since Apple is using the same CPU and mostly intel logic boards, as long as you get the CAS latency and other details exactly perfect, it's hard to imagine you would buy the wrong memory.\nPerhaps it boils down to support and testing. If the vendor literally spends more money testing and supporting the Mac memory, it's their privilege to sell it for more. If they don't and are just looking to maximize profit, that happens too. Look at Amazon charging different price based on who they think you are, what you have bought, etc... Same with airlines that charge different prices based on cookies set from previous flight searches.\nIn the end - all that matters is you understand the return policy and how to test things once you get the RAM. Then it's just a calculation, you estimate how much is your time is worth and you minimize your transaction cost - pay more for an easy buy that saves you time or spend more time looking for and researching a bargain. Perhaps the seller has decided Mac users value their time more highly and you can score a deal by saying you are buying PC RAM.\nHappy RAM hunting.\n\nA: All ram modules are non Apple, as apple does not make ram modules.\nThere are three types of ram modules.\n\n\n*\n\n*Apple branded, they come in new macs and you buy them from apple at a higher price, guaranteed to work (sometimes they mismatch the type and don't work :)\n\n*Other manufacturer branded \"mac-compatible\"... they are tested by the manufacturer (OWC, Crucial, Corsair, Kingston etc...) and work in macs (sometimes they work in some macs and don't in others)\n\n*Other manufacturer branded... untested in macs... MOST work, some don't. Apple uses very tight specs... so some memory does not pass the tests.\nHow to choose which one. Select 1. if you have money and no time to bother and look around. Select 2. if you don't have that much money but you have a little time to spare and read the manufacturer's spec. Select 3. if you actually read forums and search around for what other people like you bought and tested and it works. Cheapest option.\nConclusion: If you have money you probably have no time to read about \"sh*t\" like mac memory compatibility.\n\nA: Nothing is different. Tat particular set of RAM chips you quoted is just a scam for gullible Mac users who don't know jack about computers beyond telling the difference between a mouse and keyboard. Buy the cheaper ones.\n\nA: To answer the actual question as it was asked and spare you the BS, I've done a bit of Internet trawling and the non-Mac stick will fit into a non-Mac machine, and vice versa. Macs are more choosey about the RAM that is fitted whilst non-Mac's are more forgiving. \nAs the other person said, Mac assigned modules are tested on Macs to ensure compatibility, but, if as you illustrated above the \"PC only\" and \"MacMemory\" RAM,  have the exact same specifications (DDR3 PC3 SODIMM 204 pin 1600MHz Non-ECC Non Parity Unbuffered Latency CL10 voltage 1.5v - then they are the same modules/RAM sticks - whatever you want to call them.\n", "Q: Can't connect to wireless network at home with OS X 10.5.8 I'm having trouble connecting to the wireless network at my home.

Im looking to buy an ipad here in the US as a gift for a friend in India. \nI have looked at the 4G LTE bands and am not betting on if Indian carriers may end up using the same bands, but what concerns me is the following:\nIs the iPad(AT&T or Verizon) locked to its respective network?\nSince the GSM/HSPA+ use similar frequencies in India, could I possibly plug in an Airtel (local carrier) SIM and expect 3G to work well at least?\n\nA: Recently, Airtel Launched 4G/LTE services in Bangalore, but it made no difference to iPAD 3 community. When I contacted Airtel technical support, they offered me a LTE Indoor Wireless Gateways. Their claim is that one can carry LTE wifi-spot along with iPAD  not a bad idea for those who are travelling with all their electronic gadgets.\nTechnically, new iPAD now supports 700 MHz and 2100MHz LTE bands, and in India, DOT has allotted 2300 to 23400 MHz spectrum for BWA/LTE. Secondly, difference is of-course LTE technology modes namely Time Division Duplex (TDD – also called as TD-LTE ), Frequency Division Duplex (FDD – also called FD-LTE) and half FDD. Apple LTE Specs are following for AT&T & Verizon FD-LTE network configuration, and Airtel got a TD-LTE network. So all new iPad 3 users in Kolkata and Bangalore will have to settle down for a 3G network.\nIn India 2100 MHz band is used by defense is about to vacate 5 MHz for BWA sooner or later. 700 MHz band is used by BSNL, Defence and other disaster management agencies, about 40 MHz bandwidth is used and TRAI has recommended to get this frequency band vacated for BWA usage.\nBSNL had opted itself out of BWA/LTE space, which will make private players to dominate and bring in their price plans. Further, it will be interesting watch others including Qualcomm, Infotel (Reliance subsidiary), Aircel and Tikona who have won e-actions during mid 2010, and their plans on LTE deployment. Missing harmony between spectrum winners will result in issues in interoperability, and end users will have to bare that pain. It will be similar to current TV Set Top Boxes stories, they are not portable between satellite dish service providers, though equipment are generic.\nBut, it’s not because Airtel which uses TD-LTE technology, iPAD which wont able to connect (as one Airtel communicated to me) but because of frequency band which iPADs built with (700 & 2100 MHz) and DOT allocated (2300 MHz). I wish, Apple to push new baseband update (aka modem firmware – not sure about other dependencies such as Antennas and etc) with 2300 MHz band offered by DOT for BWA. There is difference between India operators and American operators, American Operators spend in millions for interoperability and Field Testing. FT is also done in India, with much reduced scope & coverage. Remember they have also invested in huge for spectrum, equipment and other assets, so they surely have done due-diligence to confirm deployment obligations from DOT/TRAI/Government to protect end users like you and me.\n\nA: According to this footnote on an Apple iPad page:\n\niPad models are unlocked and may support LTE networks outside the\ncountry of purchase when using a valid SIM from a supported carrier.\nContact your carrier for more details.\n\nBased on this information, your iPad should work on international networks using a local SIM, with the caveat that the local network provides data service in the bands that your iPad supports.\nThe AT&T and Verizon models support different bands, as noted on this Apple iPad 4th Gen page:\n\nModel A1459*\n\n*\n\n*GSM/EDGE (850, 900, 1800, 1900 MHz)\n\n*UMTS/HSPA+/DC-HSDPA (850, 900, 1900, 2100 MHz)\n\n*LTE (Bands 4 and 17)\n\nModel A1460*\n\n*\n\n*CDMA EV-DO Rev. A and Rev. B (800, 1900, 2100 MHz)\n\n*GSM/EDGE (850, 900, 1800, 1900 MHz)\n\n*UMTS/HSPA+/DC-HSDPA (850, 900, 1900, 2100 MHz)\n\n*LTE (Bands 1, 3, 5, 13, 25)\n\n\nThe iPad Mini supports similar bands.\n", "Q: Does anyone know what the file ~/Library/Preferences/com.npvdata.client is for? I had a heck of a time with the file ~/Library/Preferences/com.npvdata.client.  Looked like it was some kind of cryptographic key file, and when I went to edit it, not only could I not change it, but also while I was editing it the file com.npvdata.client.swp and com.npvdata.client~ showed up, even though I was editing it in vi which doesn't create backup files.  I had a really hard time deleting it, too. \nI'm guessing this is part of some kind of copy protection or licensing scheme, but I'd like to know for sure where it is from, what it is for, and what danger there is, if any, of someone else getting a hold of it.  \n\nA: If my Googling-fu is stronger than yours, this appears to be linked to the Viscosity VPN client.\nAccording to Viscosity technical support, Viscosity stores registration and trial information in this file, however it can be safely deleted if needed.\n", "Q: I've got one iPod touch, but two iTunes accounts on two separate computers When I first joined iTunes (just a month or two ago) I made a new Apple ID and iTunes account.  My sister had an Apple ID/iTunes account that my mother, sister, and brother used for their devices, but I, not ever having owned an iPod, figured that I could make my own iTunes account so that when I do purchase an iPod, I won't be pestering my sister (the first one in our house to have an iPod) for her Apple ID info.  (She's recently left for college and I didn't want to be dependent on her.)\nSo, I made an account and made use of $65 worth of gift cards that I had sitting around and put them onto my account. Now, my little sister wants some of the songs I've purchased.  But when I go to sync her device on my iTunes library, it tells me syncing will erase everything she has on her device and replace it with my library. I don't want that--I just want to share the songs from my iTunes account with her! \nIs there any sort of solution or correction?\n\nA: The issue isn't really iTunes accounts, but rather the syncing — you can only sync an iPod or iOS device with one library at a time.\nThe easiest solution now that iTunes songs are DRM-free is to copy your songs to her library, and then sync her device to her own library. To locate the actual files, select what you want in iTunes, right click and choose Reveal in Finder. \n", "Q: Photo Booth/QuickTime-recorded video is out of sync when uploaded to Facebook Trying to record videos using the built-in camera in my 27\" iMac (mid-2011, fully updated Mountain Lion) up until recently got me video that had out-of-sync audio.

Does anyone know whether Time Machine restore will inherit these errors?Or will it be smart enough to restore the files cleanly to the new hard drive?\n\nA: The only way filesystem errors like those you describe could be copied onto a different disk (e.g. your Time Machine volume) is if the whole disk partition or whole drive were copied at the block level using dd or something like Carbon Copy Cloner.  Time Machine doesn't work that way, so its stored backups should be free from the filesystem errors and the files it restores should be free from them as well.\n", "Q: Siri reports my correct birthday, but then uses wrong date when asked how many days until my birthday When I say to Siri \"When is my Birthday\", the response is May 20th, which is correct.\nHowever, when I say \"How many days until my birthday\" the response uses September 16th as the birthday.

It will be a plus if it could detect if the 3G microSIM card is removed, and send an SMS to another mobile like Avast anti-theft application for Android does.\nI don't mind about price, the more features the better.\nI would like the following options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Remote control of the lost/stolen device (get SMS, get files, capture screen, turn on camera..)\n\n*Possible remote control by sending SMS.\n\n*Check for location of stolen device via remote turning on GPS or using 3G or any other method.\n\n\nA: Apple makes their own anti-theft app, and it seems to be a fairly reasonable app as far as features. You can find out more about it here.\nAs of iOS 6, and the latest version you can use it to remotely (among other things):\n\n\n*\n\n*Lock your device\n\n*Erase your device (the app doesn't work after this)\n\n*Display a message to the user\n\n*Play a sound\n\n*Geolocate the device\n\n*Get directions to the device\n\n*Put it in Lost mode, and allow the finder to call you while the device is locked (iPhone only)\n\n\nNote that it has to have a internet connection, in order to communicate with whatever you are looking it up with. Also, it must have GPS for an accurate location - although wifi only devices that are connected to wifi should display their location, but it will be more general.\nThis app is the best one for iOS devices. Others have the limitation of sandboxing that Apple uses for security reasons. But sandboxing limits the features other anti-theft (it should be called \"Recovery\") apps can have.\n\nA: Prey is another good one. It works for all of your devices, not just iOS or Android. There is a three device limit for the free account. When you report the device as being lost or stolen, you can initiate tracking. This will send you back reports, IPs, screenshots, gps data, pictures from front facing cameras, etc. I can't tell you how great it works because fortunately none of my stuff has been stolen since I've used it, but it's nice to have another layer of security to fall back on in the event my devices end up in the wrong hands. http://preyproject.com/\n\nA: iCaughtU Pro.

Launch \"Disk Utility via \"Utility\" in the menu bar and create a partition which is \"MS DOS FAT\" formatted. If its done replace the DVD with the Windows install DVD and boot again with pressed C button. After the Windows install assistant has started, reformat the partition to NTFS and continue installing Windows.\nBe aware that Windows OEM versions won't work. It must be a retail version. \n\nA: You have to format your drive and partition to NTFS.\nThe challenge is, of course, that in order to format, you need to be able to boot the computer.

Is there another way to fix this?\n\nA: I had to work this out because it was happening to me to but with the snapchat and facebook messager app. All you need todo is reboot your phone and reset your network settings then after that sign back into your wifi or just use 3G. I'm sure if you tried it would work with any app.\n\nA: If you are jailbroken, install SAM. Once installed, go to your iPhone Settings > SAM > Utilities and run De-Activate iPhone (Clear push).\nRestart your phone and connect to iTunes. Problem should be solved.\n\nA: I ended up backing up my iPhone, wiping it, then restoring the backup onto it. After that, everything worked fine. There might be a better way of doing it out there, but if so I didn't find it...\n\nA: You have to just log off from itunes&app store, reboot and then log on agsin. Had the exact same problem with Dropbox and this loop of popups to connect to itunes etc. Doing the above fixed it.\n\nA: I simply went into the settings and went into the app's settings, then after that I turned off location services and background app refresh for the app and then it worked just fine! Hope this helps!\n\nA: I tried rebooting, logging out and in App Store, and none worked. It's the Music app that's causing the trouble. Log out of your Apple ID in the Music app and log back in. It'll fix the problem; at least it did so, for me. And my issue was with more than one app. All notifications were messed up. \n", "Q: iOS app to edit .txt files (w/ Dropbox sync) that preserves Windows-style line breaks I commonly edit .txt files on my PC (Notepad) and my Mac (using TextEdit) and store them in Dropbox.  I would like also like to be able to edit these .txt files on my iOS devices.  Every app that I've tried breaks the Windows-style line breaks; if I edit a .txt file, all line breaks are lost when I open that file in Notepad.  \nIs there any iOS app which can edit .txt files and preserve Windows-style line breaks? (Paid is OK, but cheaper is better.)  I have tried iA Writer and Write 2.\n\nA: Nebulous Notes and Elements both support windows newline characters.\n", "Q: Apple ID replaced with someone else's after iOS 6 upgrade (Security breach) I just updated my iPad retina (3rd generation) with iOS 6 and now my Apple ID has been replaced with someone else's ID. \n\nAnd its not jailbroken either. How did someone manage to do that? This is a serious security breach, I think.\nI logged out of that Apple ID but how can I be sure that they are not tracking anything and won't be able to purchase through my account?\n\nA: This is not as serious as it appears as signing into a device using a different Apple ID does not give one access to all the data on your device. What happens when you launch an app that you have officially purchased from the App Store? If it asks for the password of your proper Apple ID, then I would skip to the end of this answer and call Apple because that means the rogue account is actually signed in. If, however, it launches, then you are in fact logged into your proper account.\nFirst, sign out of that Apple ID. Then sign into your existing (proper) one. Once done, sign out and then proceed to change the password on your Apple ID: https://appleid.apple.com/ as a proactive measure. And I would strongly advise you to use Apple's two-step verification if it is available in your country.\nThere exists no known way to hack into an OTA firmware update and hijack a system. iOS is actually quite secure. While I can explain how that email got there, I can say that it's likely an Apple server side error. Or someone local got a hold of your device and is messing with you.\nLastly, if you are 100% sure it occurred without explanation, I would contact Apple and not send emails to the iTunes Team, as they falls outside the scope of anything they can help you with. International contact info can be found here: http://support.apple.com/kb/he57\n\nA: I'd suggest deactivating your iTunes account ASAP. You should get in touch with Apple support too.\n", "Q: Can I make unlocking the screensaver also unlock the login keychain? I have the screen saver on my Mac password protected, but unlocking the screen saver does not unlock the login keychain.  I know this because I get asked to unlock the login keychain shortly after unlocking the screensaver. \nYes, my login password and keychain password have been synchronized.  \nYes, I've run Keychain First Aid and confirmed there are no problems.\nThe workaround is to change the Keychain Settings so the login keychain never automatically locks, but I'd prefer to have it lock automatically, especially on my laptop when it goes to sleep, but now with Mountain Lion and iCloud that means typing my password twice every time I wake my laptop: once for the screensaver and once for the keychain.\nThere should be a way to make the screensaver also unlock the keychain just the way the normal login also unlocks the keychain. Is there? \n\nA: This usually happens when you change your login password without changing your keychain password.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Keychain Access\n\n*Click Edit -> Change Password for Keychain 'Login'\n\n*Match the password to the one you log into the computer with.\n\n\nIf you firmly believe \"this is not the problem\", please try to delete your keychain and recreate it in order to get the link between the login and keychain to properly function. (thanks @dragon788)\n\nA: I have read that you ran Keychain First Aid, \nbut you were not clear about checking your \"Keychain First Aid\" preferences (under Keychain Preferences):  you can choose there to never lock the keychain while logged in, and re-run First Aid.\nAlso, if you right-click on the keychain, which requires a manual unlock, and then choose keychain settings, there is an option to lock the keychain after x minutes of inactivity or at system sleep. \nMy guess is that the first setting might be activated. \n", "Q: How to change Bluetooth channel used by Google Earth This might be more a Google Earth issue, but here goes.\nI've paired my Mountain Lion laptop with a Garmin Bluetooth GPS, and can confirm getting NMEA data over the serial channel with\ncat /dev/tty.GarminGPS10-Gps10\nHowever, when I try to connect to the GPS inside Google Earth, I see the message\n\nReading /dev/cu.Bluetooth-PDA-Sync\n\nand nothing happens.

Most Windows desktop browsers utilize the keyboard combination Ctrl + F5 to force a page specific cache refresh, while browsers running on macOS tend to use Command + R.\nIs there an equivalent cache refresh for a single page in Safari running on iOS?\nI realize I can manually clear the browser cache, but I'd prefer to only refresh for the page I am currently viewing.\n\nA: Force quit did not work reliably for me in iOS 8. What did is using private mode for testing:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the page in private mode (and bookmark it so you can open it later).\n\n*When you need to refresh, close browser \"tab\" (you can stay in Safari and private mode).\n\n*Open the page again (use the bookmark you created in step 1).\n\n\nA: Tried some of the ideas above before I found this page.. \nDouble-clcking doesn't work anymore in Safari..\nLong-press switches to editing the URL now..\nclosing and reopening windows didn't help either...\nBut, one of the solutions for DNS errors, and connectivity issues worked.. it forced it to reload the cache since it thought it was on a new network.\nTurn off WiFi, refresh the page (to fail), then turn WiFi back on. Page refreshed.\nThis fixes a number of issues,  also seems to fix Airdrop as well.\n\nA: If you have your phone wired to your Apple computer/laptop, with the Safari developer tools open (and active window) you can press:\n\nCommand + Option + R\n\n\nA: You can force the device to stop caching files by connecting it to a computer with a cable and enabling Safari developer mode.\n\n\n*\n\n*Enable Web Inspector on the mobile device:\nSettings > Safari > Advanced > Web Inspector\n\n*Enable Dev tools in Safari on macOS:\nSafari > Preferences > Advanced tab > Show Develop in menu bar\n\n*Connect the device to the computer\n\n*Open the dev tools panel for the device from Safari on the computer:\nDevelop > Example's iPhone > example.com/page\n\n*To disable caching, go to the Network tab and make sure the little icon for \"no cache\" is blue (looks like a cylinder with a crossout through it).\n\n*Now you should be able to just hit refresh anytime on the iOS device and you will get an up to date non-cached version!\n\n\nIf you're a web developer this is the ideal way to do it because now you have access to the extremely useful full dev tools panel. And you don't have to keep repeating an annoying process if you need to get a fresh version all the time, not just clear the cache once.\nIf you're just a general user trying to clear their cache, you might want to use one of the other methods here.\n\nUpdate: You can now connect to the device over WiFi.

At the risk of getting a big NO, \nIs there a way to use SIRI to invoke navigation on Google maps as opposed to the default Apple maps? \nI have tried \"Navigate to Chicago using Google maps\", but Siri just treated \"Chicago using Google maps\" as the location itself. \n\nA: Unfortunately, 3rd party Siri integration is something that hasn't been available to developers (yet). For example, it would be really nice to say, \"Start a running activity with RunKeeper,\" and have it start a running activity.\nThe closest thing to this is to simply say \"Open Google Maps.\" I know it may seem a little lacking, but that is all we get right now.\n\nA: Here is the closest and best bet I happened to find on Google: \nAppend \"via transit\" to the end of the voice command and Siri brings up a bunch of transport apps.

I have a USB audio interface which I use for recording. When I use some recording app (like Audacity), I can select the USB interface from a drop down menu, which will tell Audacity to use that device for audio input.\nSometimes I want to record from that device, and also add voice-over using my computer's internal microphone. I cannot record from more than one device simultaneously using Audacity (as far as I know), so I'm looking for a program to mix the inputs first.\nI have the Soundflower driver installed, so all I need is a program where I can select both my USB interface and my internal microphone for input, and select the Soundflower device for output. That way, I can select the Soundflower device as input in Audacity to record the pre-mixed audio.\nIs there such a program, and am I on the right track (no pun intended)?\n\nA: I have a similar need when recording Skype calls. My setup is somewhat different, but the fundamentals should work for your setup. Best of all, you can do it without buying any specialized applications. Rogue Amoeba has a great application called Line In that will allow you to pipe your system's inputs to whatever outputs you are available, including Soundflower. \n\n\n*\n\n*Go to System Preferences -> Sound: \n\n\n*\n\n*Select internal mic as your input if that's what you want to use as your second device. Your output is probably headphones if you're recording. Select that.\n\n\n*Start Soundflower. \n\n\n*\n\n*Click the menu bar icon. Select Audio Setup from the bottom of the popup menu \n\n\n*This will bring up the Audio MIDI setup application. From here, you'll create an \"Aggregate Device,\" which is accomplished by clicking the + icon in the lower-lefthand corner. \n\n\n*\n\n*I've attached a screenshot so you can see how what the Aggregate Device I've setup here looks like. Your USB input should show up in this menu - add it as an input, along with your internal mic. Don't sweat the output part (that's in the next step).\n\n*Please note that the settings in this screenshot are not meant to be representative of how you should configure this on your machine, and are just for a visual cue. \n\n\n\n*Start Line In: \n\n\n*\n\n*Set your input as the Aggregate Device you created, and pass that as output to Soundflower (2 Ch). When you're recording, you can select \"pass thru,\" which will allow you to monitor the audio. Nice.\n \n\n\n*Finally, fire up Audacity, and make sure Soundflower is selected as the input. This should create a chain that ultimately pipes your inputs into Audacity. \nI hope this helps, and good luck!\n\nA: If Soundflower (and LineIn) are not sufficient, you can route/combine virtually any inputs with Rogue Amoeba's Loopback -- but it is a paid (and supported) app. And you can create multiple routings/combinations... \n", "Q: Can I \"play higher rated songs more often\" in iTunes 11?

After a disk crash in my MacBook Pro running Lion, I replaced the drive, installed Mountain Lion, and am rebuilding my system. I used Migration Assistant to transfer from an external bootable clone drive (with the old Lion system)  'users' and possibly 'settings', but not 'applications' or 'other files.' I wanted a clean, new system, but Migration Assistant sure is helpful for not having to re-enter user id info, passwords, network settings & passwords, etc! Half my apps are reinstalled so far.\nIn the Dock, apps which used to be, but are not yet installed show as a question mark: [OOPS, can't post the pic:\"as a spam prevention mechanism, new users aren't allowed to post images\"] I guess this means the Migration Assistant transferred info like \"apps which are in the dock.\" An earlier question:\nIs there a complete and detailed description of what Migration Assistant copies over?\nfailed to enumerate precisely what Migration Assistant transfers. I could not find any SystemMigration.log file on my new system.\nNow the weird part: When I have the external bootable Lion disk attached, all the missing apps show up in my dock and are executable! Is this is normal? not supposed to happen? It was particularly disconcerting and confusing--I am a pretty novice OS X user!--when the new system had Pathfinder 6 installed and running--and from the backup drive Pathfinder 5 showed up in the dock and got started somehow. Suddenly the drive and other icons on the desktop were showing up twice, with the duplicates often overlapping each other. Plus Pathfinder started asking me to purchase & register! It took me a while to figure out this was from a separate instance which wanted its own license key!\nSimilarly odd: I have not yet been able to install the great little muCommander app (security violation in Mountain Lion?), yet with the backup drive attached, there it was in the dock and fully runnable.\nI have routinely had drives with backup, bootable partitions attached and mounted (when running Lion); e.g. a 1T drive with 400G bootable backup and 600G data. I never have seen this behavior. Is this normal or dangerous? Might I have gotten inconsistent settings onto the 'clean' new system via Migration Assistant? Any other possible causes?\nEdit: I later (Feb 2013) discovered a partial solution for this problem provided in a July 2012 post by Martin Bay \nhttp://martinbay.net/reset-dock-os-x/      which I quote below:\n\nI’ve just installed Mountain Lion and wondered how the new dock would look like from a fresh installation – so had to figure out how to do that – no problem!\nTo completely reset the dock back to the original settings do the following:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Delete the files com.apple.dock.plist from /Users/”user name”/Library/Preferences. Remember to replace “user name” with your OS >X account name.\n  \n*Enter ‘killall Dock’ command in the terminal and press enter\nrm /Users/\"user name\"/Library/Preferences/com.apple.dock.plist\nkillall Dock\n\nThis nicely cleaned up (removed the question marks in) my dock.\nFinally (March 2013) answered the remainder of my question. Apparently Migration Asst. copies \"Login items\" = startup programs from the backup disk/system and places them in System Prefs/Users/Login Items, with the link back to the applications directory on the backup drive. So if my external drive was detached these items were 'Unknown' and if attached, they started upon login, from the backup drive. Solution: delete old items from Login Items. Ya live and learn.\n\nA: Migration Assistant copies everything, including corrupted preferences.\nIf you want to have a truly clean system, what you need to do is do a secure reformatting of the hard drive that you will be installing the new system on, make sure that you only install applications directly using the installer from the original installation source (and if available, you should get it from the Mac App Store).\nOn Mountain Lion, the OS will recognise apps installed on an external drive in a previous system as installed on the System. You need to uninstall or delete those apps and then they will not be seen as installed.\nAs regards the apps you cannot launch due to the GateKeeper security in Mac OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion, that is part of the enhanced security. If you try and launch those apps from within PathFinder, you will not be able to. The first launch must happen in the Finder, and if you get an error telling you that the app cannot be launched due to security settings in GateKeeper, then you launch the app by right-clicking on the app and selecting \"Open\" from the contextual menu. Then you will get a new dialog box that asks you if you are certain you would like to open the app as it is not signed/recognised.\nYou can disable that feature by changing the settings in the Security & Privacy Control Panel, and setting \"Allow applications downloaded from:\" to Anywhere. The default setting is \"Mac App Store and identified developers\"\n\nA: When you migrated your system from the external drive, the system you moved retained all its hooks and references to programs and files on the external drive.\nIn other words, the migrated system on your internal drive still thinks it resides on the external drive. When the external drive is missing, the system cannot find everything it expects to use. When you plug the external back in, the system can now find the \"missing\" parts.\n", "Q: Is there an OS X app to route keyboard via bluetooth? I want an app on my desktop that lets me route my keyboard to my iPhone via bluetooth.\nThe main goal is to type with the keyboard when I get a text. I don't mind having to click a button on an app.  It would be nice if I can share it via bluetooth? So i can register it as a keyboard on my iPhone. Is this possible?\n\nA: Type2Phone\nThis app does pretty much exactly what you're looking for. It turns your Mac into a Bluetooth keyboard that you can pair your iOS device to.

If you have 4GB or less, upgrading to 8GB is a small dollar investment that provides a great return in speed.\n\n\n*the wireless router\n\n*\n\n*are you experiencing slow or choppy wifi performance anywhere other than AirPlay?\n\n*does your MacBook Pro intermittently drop its wifi connection even when you have a full signal?\n\n*what wireless router(s) do you have, and how old are they?\n\n*\n\n*just because it says G or N doesn't mean the wifi router is \"any good\" or supports all the protocols needed for AirPlay\n\n\n*how far is the wireless router from your tv and MacBook?\n\n*\n\n*within reason, the closer the better\n\n\n\n\nYou call yourself a technophobe and moron, and I'm not here to dispute either of them (but I think you can achieve what you're hoping for!). My simple suggestion to resolve your problem: replace your wifi router with an Apple AirPort Extreme (less than $200) or AirPort Express (about $100).\n\n\n*\n\n*I have used macs and iOS devices with a number of different brands of wireless routers, to limited success and happiness, usually defendant upon the age of the router. Older wifi gear does not support all the tricks and new technology Apple (and Intel) builds into the newer computers.\n\n*I've had the best success with Apple's AirPort Extreme or Express base stations... for working with both Macs and Windows boxes.\n\n*\n\n*the AirPort Extreme let's you hook up a USB hard drive as a centralized TimeMachine backup disk for all your Macs backups\n\n*both the Extreme and Express let you attach a USB printer for remote printing\n\n\n\nEither of the two routers are quick to set up, work with your Internet gateway, and should accomplish what you need. If you have an Apple store nearby, swing by and pick one up. You already have the software on your MacBook to configure it.\nGood luck!\n", "Q: Safari extension for adding arbitrary Javascript to a page? Is there a way to do this?\nI know I can use Stylish for adding arbitrary CSS to pages on a per-domain basis. Looking for something similar to add Javascript.\nFor example, let's say I wanted to turn the text red for any h1 element on a particular site if the content of that h1 element is \"News\". Can't do that with CSS, need to do it with Javascript. Is there any extension I can use to add this? Or would I have to write my own?\n\nA: The dotjs Safari extension sounds like it will do what you want. It injects the JavaScript (from your ~/.js directory) that is served up by a small, local Ruby web server from the original dotjs Chrome extension.\n\nA: I previously used dotjs and dotcss for Safari. As I relied on these a lot, I've written an extension for Safari 12 that provides the same functionality in one extension with a simpler setup.\nIn case you're interested, I have an introductory blog post. The extension is available on the App Store ($5).

However I realised that the Play Count does not update when this option is applied.\nFollowing the issue from iTunes 11 where play counts do not update if crossfade is activated, is this another possible glitch ? Or has it always been this way ? Any workaround that can fix it ?\n\nA: It's somewhere between a bug and not-a-bug. Play count increments when the last sample plays (or something roughly equivalent). But the duration metadata options don't actually change the file, so the very end still exists, but is always skipped. So, the play count never increments.\nThe only workaround I know involves changing the audio file itself. \nIf you're using mp3s (or AAC or another lossy codec), doing this in iTunes involves re-encoding (transcoding) an already lossy file, a minor pet-peeve of mine and something I do not recommend. I suspect there are paid audio editing tools which can cut an mp3 without further losses, but I don't know what they might be.\nIf you're using apple lossless (or wav), or you really don't care about transcoding, you can do it simply enough in iTunes:\n\n\n*\n\n*I'm assuming you've already set the start and stop time metadata appropriately. \n\n*In iTunes, go to Preferences -> General -> Import settings... and set everything to match the encoder settings of the original file (you can see this info by choosing \"Get info\" on the song in question).\n\n*Select the song, right click it and choose \"Create [codec] Version\", where [codec] is whatever you selected (for instance, if you chose ALAC it will say \"Create Apple Lossless Version\").\n\n*Done. iTunes has truncated the audio file to the limits set by your start/stop time metadata. \n", "Q: How do I downgrade an iPhoto library from version 9 to version 8.1 I recently acquired an older Mac and am trying to copy an iPhoto library from a newer computer to it.  However, the older version of iPhoto refuses to open, telling me \"You can't open your current photo library using this version of iPhoto... Pease quit and use the latest version of iPhoto.\"\nHowever, upgrading to the latest version of iPhoto isn't an option.\nI found some information suggesting I could downgrade a library to an earlier version of iPhoto.  However, it says to use the \"Rebuild Library\" command from the \"Library\" menu.  However, there is no such menu in my version of iPhoto.  I found an Apple on rebuilding the iPhoto library (http://support.apple.com/kb/HT2638) but the option that I seem to need: \"Repair the iPhoto Library Database\" does not appear in the \"Rebuild Photo Library\" dialog box I get on startup holding Command and Option, although the \"Rebuild the iPhoto Library Database from automatic backup\" appears but is grayed out.\n\nA: I know your pain. I have a 2006 iMac 24 inch and up graded to version 9 iPhoto and every thing went haywire when I opened the program (pixelation, blank screens, frozen screen etc.) I dealt with Apple help over the phone for over 8 hours over a couple of days. They took control of my computer and took snapshots of various screens and sent to their IT for analysis. They got back to me about a week later and said version 9 is not compatible with the GeForce 7300GT GPU. The choice was downgrade to my previous IPhoto version or upgrade the vid card. I chose for the downgrade. The Apple tech took over my screen by remote and spent close to an hour doing wizardry and got it done. BTW He did not lose any of my pictures either. I guess although I provide no help with your problem since the tech did all the work (and I really know nothing) I want you to know there is a solution to your problem out there, somewhere.\nSorry I can not be of more help.\nOh yeah Apple gave me a full refund for the iPhoto ver 9 that I purchased. Apple Help line did everything possible to help me and I was impressed with there attitude and effort.\n\nA: I believe that the command \"Rebuild Library\" you're looking for is not in iPhoto but is actually in an excellent 3rd party app called iPhoto Library Manager.\nHere's a link to the documentation on using iPhoto Library Manager to revert to a previous version.\nhttp://www.fatcatsoftware.com/iplm/Help/downgrading%20a%20library%20to%20an%20earlier%20version%20of%20iphoto.html \n", "Q: Problem with MacPorts I have MacPorts installed on my Mac and a lot of ports that were put on my machine years ago by my sysadmin for various purposes. There is quite a lot of garbage out there, but worst of all, the MacPorts system itself is fried.\nMy immediate desire is to upgrade subversion via MacPorts. When I try to use MacPorts to update itself (sudo port -d selfupdate), I get an inscrutable error message referring to \"the log\" but it does not indicate which log, as it often does.\nAfter some hacking with -d and poking around at likely logs, it appears that the cc compiler is missing or failing. I have XCode 4.5.2 installed so I am wondering why this issue is occurring.\nBottom line: I am looking for a way to fix MacPorts; then eventually update everything, clean up the inactive ports, and finally make sure subversion is updated.\nI am wondering about these possible steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Uninstall/reinstall Xcode.\n\n*Uninstall/reinstall MacPorts. The instructions for this seem to indicate that all installed ports will be removed, which is scary as I am not sure what that would break, but it would probably break something.\nAre these possible corrective paths?

I recently upgraded from an iPhone 4s to iPhone 5. How do I transfer all my apps to the new iPhone 5? I have tried two times without success:\nFirst attempt:\n\n\n*\n\n*From iTunes, make \"a full backup\" of the 4s on \"this computer.\"\n\n*From iTunes, restore the backup to the iPhone 5\n\n\nThis transferred all my contacts, call history, messages, and photos but all my 3rd party apps were missing. (Also messages I had received on the iPhone 5 before restoring were over-written... any way to prevent this?) The size of the resulting backup files was only 10GB; about the amount of photos and videos on my 4s. Note: I can view the list of my purchased 3rd party apps from the app store and download/install them one at a time. When I re-install the apps, they retain all their old data and even old icon locations.\nSecond attempt:\n\n\n*\n\n*From iTunes, click 'Automatically sync new apps'\n\n*Again, make \"a full backup\" of the 4s on \"this computer,\" (this time using the \"Encrypt iPhone backup\" in hopes my passwords would also be retained.)\n\n*Again, restore the backup to the iPhone 5\n\n\nThis time, the backup size was about 20GB. However, still no 3rd party apps were transferred except a few apps I had re-installed since the last restore.\nWhen I view my apps on the 4s from iTunes (version 11.0.1.12) I see one significant difference from most on-line instructions. Although 99 apps are visible on the right, I am unable to select any of them because they are not listed on the left:\n\nIf it makes any differnce, my iPhones 4s still has iOS version 5.1.1 while the iPhone 5 has iOS version 6.\nAlso, at the end of the restore, the iPhone 5 seems to reboot automatically. However, after waiting for a long time, nothing happened so I restarted the phone manually.\nSo how do I make a truly full backup of my iPhone 4s and fully restore it on my iPhone 5?\n\nA: I had the same issue (I use iTunes on Windows 7). I Bought a new iPhone 5 and used the Backup / Restore method to move my stuff from the old iPhone 4S to the new one. The process only restored all the Apple apps, plus Contacts, Phone Calls, and Messages. When I tried to backup again - hoping it would restore the rest - it went through a restore process in iTunes (for about 5 minutes) and then I got the message that my iPhone will restart but never did (I had to restart it manually).\nWhat I also noticed was that, when I retried, the Backup seemed to be very quick.\nI called Apple Support who said that there is a problem with the Backup process. I would be able to restore my Apps via the Purchased Apps process but I would lose all my user data (such as games progress). I was extremely frustrated because I use my iPhone and iPad as tools, not game devices.\nI went to the App Store on the iPhone and started downloading some of the Purchased apps from the what seemed to be the iCloud. To my surprise, all app data was there (eg. WhatsApp chats, and The Vault data). I am not sure how this works because I never deliberatelly setup app backup on the cloud, but I suspect that the \"Documents and Data\" == \"On\" setting on Settings --> iCloud does exactly that, and in return does not include this information on the PC backup.\nAll seems fine now (at least for the apps for which I care and tried). The issue I still have is this uncertainty on what exactly is my iPhone doing and where is my stuff at any point in time.\n\nA: Just a guess into the wild... All the apps you are trying to install have to be present on the source you want to sync from, which usually is either iTunes or iCloud. A backup usually does not contain content from the App-Store (like apps etc...)\nThis is what worked for me after some trial and error on iTunes 11: select \"File\" -> \"Devices\" -> \"Transfer purchases from myPhone\" from the menu bar. Then all your missing apps are transfered to your computer. After it is done you might want to refresh the backup of your phone, by clicking on \"backup now\" on the summary page of your phone. After that you should be able to setup your new phone with all the data from your old device. (Maybe reset the new iPhone first by deleting all the content on it via the settings app)\n\nA: Apps purchased are not contained in the backup, therefore they will not restore. They can be found in your iTunes, under apps purchased and can be downloaded again to your device. Appdata however is found in the backup - it can be extracted with software such as iPhone Backup Extractor, and then imported back to the device. Hope this helps!\n\nA: I believe the problem is in iTunes 11. I found, that on the Apps tab there is now missing \"Sync Apps\" checkbox. They believe, they have replaced this with iCloud. But only partially. If you would install applications you would find, that the data has been synced.\nI have solved this by using my old PC with iTunes 10.7. I had to run the restore from my 3GS backup twice. I have wiped all data and settings and restored backup. This installed applications but not all settings (background I guess) and application order was preserved. Thank I have connected the iPhone again and restored again (but without wiping the data). Now my iPhone 5 has all the applications in correct folders with all its data. Strange restarts not corresponding to the instructions from iTunes were experienced too.\n\nA: The iOS version shouldn't matter, but I would Erase All Content and Settings and restore from iCloud and transfer the rest of your content from iTunes.\n\nA: I had the same issue, but found a TRICK/Solution.\nTHIS ONLY HAPPENS WHEN YOU BUY A USED PHONE WITH PREVIOUS USER'S APPS ON IT. \n1) FOR Factory Unlocked phones> If you had bought a Used Iphone , then the first thing to do is to do a MASTER Reset and then do a fresh start , once you go on the screen where it says Startup as a new phone OR Restore from backup . just simply click restore from back and every single thing will be restored to your phone as its with all APPS, and DATA .. \n2) FOR GEVEY SIM/ RIM SIM UNLOCKED PHONES > If you are using a Gevey sim or RIM uncloked sim cards to unlcock your phone and are scared to do the Master reset of the phone in order to lose the UNCLOCK OR SCARED OF THE ACTIVATION ISSUE , then you can still get all you Apps back on the phone. just do this .. \nGo on itunes and fist try doing the restore from your backup . Hopefully every thing will be backedup but NOT APPS .. now the problem is ,, your Itnues account on phone is conflicting with the APPS OF THE PREVIOUS USER ..the only solution is to DELETE ALL THE APPS FROM THE PREVIOUS USER... if you dont know which apps to delete .. just \nclick on the itnues tab and look for Devices. under devices click on Transfer purchases. when you do that. An error message will show saying ETC ETC , apps are not going to transfer. (THESE ARE THE APPS WHICH WERE DOWNLOADED BY THE OTHER USER) so just click on show details , it will show you the list of apps need to be deleted. Now go on your iphone and simply delete the apps. and boom .. now click on sync apps and it will sync all your apps back on your iphone. \nLet me know if that helps thank you!\nBest of luck \n", "Q: sync all contacts between devices Ok, I got an iPhone & iPad, only I use two different libraries on iTunes. \nI got Google installed on both devices (plus desktop). \nBut for some reasons only part of my contacts are on the iPhone, while\nall of them are on my iPad. \nWhat the simplest way to sync (and merge if necessary) these between devices?\niCloud, Google (chrome/calendar/gmail), bluetooth, other app? \n\nA: You can use the CardDAV protocol to sync your contacts. Here is an explanation how you can use it: Syncing contacts\nThere is also the possibility to use Google as an Exchange account. You should be able to find the instructions on the interwebs (I fear, if I post a link it will be in german language)\nIf you also enable the Google account also on your Addressbook application, merging them should be easy (depending on the application).

If it is HFS formated, Windows does not recognize it. Have you tried to format it with FAT32?\n", "Q: CardDav / CalDav not syncing existing entries I set up both CalDav and CardDav on my iPhone 4S using iOS 6. It does sync new entries both ways but it fails to sync any of the existing ones. Google search queries did not shed any light on this question, so:\nIs this service meant to sync existing information either one way or two ways?\n\nA: I was having a similar problem, at least with Gmail contacts using CardDav. The problem is that CardDav puts your newly synced contacts in a separate \"group\" on your iphone than your current contacts. (You can check that by hitting \"groups\" in the upper left of your contacts and seeing what's listed there.) So for new contacts, yes, it will sync both ways, but not necessarily for old ones that were solely on your phone.\nA couple of things to start with:\n1. When you make a new contact on your iphone, does it properly sync with your gmail contacts online? (I think you say that it does, but I'm just checking.) If not, go to Settings->Mail, Contacts, Calendars->Default Account (the one under the Contacts section) and choose Google).\n\n\n*\n\n*Had you ever synced with gmail contacts in the past? Are the contacts that were in your iphone different from the ones in gmail, or are there duplicates?\n\n\nBecause CardDav does not touch the existing iphone contacts, there's no good way to get those to be in gmail. The only way I've found to do this is for each contact, choose \"share\" and email it to yourself. When you get the email on your phone, add it to your contacts. Then, assuming Google is the default (see #1 above), it'll put it in the right place and then all syncing will work as it should.\nI agree that this is convoluted, but it's the best I can come up with after days of searching and messing around. I had previously synced with Gmail contacts using iTunes (no longer supported, as far as I can tell), so once I set up CardDav it downloaded all of my existing contacts, creating two of everything, but it at least knew enough to link them so they only show up once.\nYou'll have to specify exactly what the problem is with syncing calendars with CalDav. That's something I've actually had better luck with.\n\nA: Here what I do to solve sync with Google Contact ** :\n\n\n*\n\n*Install free App, Contacts Kit (free). It's contact backup solution apps.\n\n*Backup All your contact using the apps.\n\n*Go to icloud.com. Delete all your contact from iCloud. ( this to prevent double entry) \n\n*Open your iPhone contact to see if all the contact gone.\n\n*Go back to App, Load back your contact from Apps Backup to your iPhone contact directory.\n\n*Open your iPhone contact, you should see all your contact back to normal.\n\n*CardDAV should start sync your contact with Google Contact now.\n\n\nHope that help, I'm still looking at this to see any unforeseen side effect or strange behaviour.\n** After all the Google CardDAV configuration is done and contact default has been change to Google CardDAV. \n", "Q: Will this RAM work for me?

I am a music fanatic, with well over a terabyte of music stored in iTunes.  I also have an iPhone, an iPod, and an iPad, each with a different storage size.\nWhile I can only put about 10 gigs of \"favorites\" on my iPhone, my iPad and iPod are able to hold much more than that, and I would like the ability to \"set and forget\" what I sync to each (say, 30 gigs of \"party music\" on my iPod, and 30 gigs of \"relaxation music\" on my iPad) so that I don't have to manually sync each one each time I connect it to the computer.  In addition, I would like to be able to put videos on the iPad without having to worry about them taking up space when my iPhone automatically syncs, etc.\nIs there a way to accomplish this?\n\nA: iTunes syncs each device individually, and allows you to have different settings for each device. If it were me, I would create a “Relaxation music\" playlist and set it to sync to your iPad, \"Party Music\" playlist on your iPod, and such. Then plug your iOS device into iTunes (or use Wifi), and make sure “sync only checked songs and videos” and “Manually manage music and videos\" are NOT checked under Summary > Options. Then select the Music tab, and check “Selected playlists, artists, albums and genres” deselect everything except the playlists/songs/albums you want on that iOS device. \nOne thing to note: you can create other playlists that divide \"Relaxation music\" more and then set those to sync to that device as well.\nRepeat the above process for every device - setting only the desired playlist to sync to that device.

If you know the exact version number of your Macintosh, they can tell you exactly what the upgrade possibilities are and give you the exact memory specifications for your particular model. They post notices about which Apple firmware updates must be applied to your specific model before you attempt an upgrade. Of course they sell RAM at good prices, but you could use their upgrade advice to purchase RAM of the appropriate specification from a different company than theirs. \n", "Q: Why is `/etc/sysctl.conf` not determining my `kern.maxfiles` setting?

My understanding is iCloud uses server-side encryption of customer data. \nI am no expert but what about the data e.g. of an app like 1Password which can syncs very sensitive user data to many devices via iCloud.\nSince 1Password purposefully encrypts data before sending it to iCloud, does this mean the data cannot be looked up by Apple employees?\n\nA: 1Password does not use \"iCloud\" which is a service offering from Apple, by default it uses Dropbox but can also use other cloud solutions. 1Password does not support storing data on Apple's iCloud.\n1Password 3 data file sync solutions\nAbout 1Password Encryption\n\nThe slightly longer answer is that your data is encrypted using AES,\n  the same state-of-the-art encryption algorithm used as the national\n  standard in the United States. 1Password uses 128-bit keys for\n  encryption, which means that it would take millions of years for a\n  criminal to decrypt your data using a brute force attack.\n\nAnd more about Agile Keychain Design and encryption\nInformation about Dropbox and encryption. Keep in mind that Dropbox does not encrypt the files that you store with their service, but they do encrypt the traffic between your computer and their servers at Amazon.\nUPDATE 20121217:\nI see that the latest version of 1Password does offer the ability to use Apple's iCloud for storing and sharing.\nHere is an knowledge base article from Apple on the subject, iCloud: iCloud security and privacy overview. But it does not cover the encryption of non-Apple application data.\nArs has a much better article discussing encryption in iCloud, Apple holds the master decryption key when it comes to iCloud security, privacy\nIt seems to me that Agilebits has really fallen behind on updating their web site with information about the latest version of 1Password for iOS. It looks like 1Password Pro, which I have been using for awhile now, has been removed from iTunes and the only version available is the new version here. I would guess that a new version for the desktop is also on its way.\n\nA: I've been a 1Password user for several years and rely on the program across my Macs, iPhone and iPad. The chief architect seems to be on top of security and encryption.\nWith the release of 1Password 4 for iOS, it now uses iCloud and/or Dropbox for syncing encrypted password files. Regardless of the encryption used (or not) on the cloud layer, the program encrypts the 1Password keychain with a 128-bit AES key.\nWhile the company has been fairly tight-lipped on the content of the Windows or OS X versions of 1Password 4, I'm willing to assume that the program will also sync the encrypted file through Dropbox and/or iCloud, like the iOS version.\nI find this split syncing model fascinating for mixed-OS environments: the programs will push and pull the data around whatever cloud access you have.\n\nA: 1Password actually does use iCloud on iOS, if you enable it. I can't tell you that 1Password sends encrypted data to iCloud, but all data on iCloud is encrypted. No, Apple employees cannot sift your data, even if they wanted to it would be encrypted; however government agencies like the NSA, Chinese Intelligence agencies, international agencies, and even people will collect any data of interest, stored over the internet.\n", "Q: How can I send a mail message later? On Mountain Lion I want to compose a message, but rather than clicking \"Send\", I want to schedule a future delivery date and have the mail sent then without my taking action as long as the computer is still running. \nI'm currently using Apple mail with Google apps configured using IMAP syncing.\nThe answers here using Mail Scripts by Andreas Amann no longer works on Lion or Mountain Lion. Can something be done on 10.8 or later to automate sending Apple mail?\n\nA: If you're using Gmail and are willing to use the (I think very awesome) web interface, check out Boomerang for Gmail. It does everything you're asking for.\nEDIT: \nYou can also use Automator to schedule (by delaying) when your message is sent. \n\nThe Pause function is very helpful, and Apple has a whole section for Mail in the library.

My wife has an iPhone and has downloaded her own music to it. She recently connected the iPhone to our home computer (where my iTunes library resides) and all of her music was automatically added to the iTunes library. However, our music tastes differ considerably. \nAt this point, what's the easiest way for me to remove her songs from the library? I can go through and delete each song, but I believe if she ever connects her iPhone again, it will delete the songs off of her phone too (or sync them back to iTunes). Is there some way for her to have her own library that she syncs with and a separate library for my music? \nI suspect this is a pretty basic question with an easy answer, but would appreciate some help.\n\nA: Plug her phone back into iTunes. In iTunes, click on her iphone, and in Options uncheck anything having to do with \"Syncing Automatically\". If it's not already checked, click \"Manually manage music and videos\". \nIf you want her to have a separate iTunes library, she should also have a separate login for the shared computer. This is really the easiest way to deal anything on a shared computer.\nIncidentally, there shouldn't really be any reason to physically plug your iPhone into your computer anymore. You can actually set the phone (and iPads, etc) to sync wirelessly.\n", "Q: How can I rotate my signature in Preview? I have scanned my signature and can insert it just fine, but at the wrong angle!\nHow can I rotate it (90 deg)?\n\nA: You can also rotate signatures and other annotations, like text boxes or rectangles, by arbitrary angles:\nHold the Command ⌘ key and do a rotation gesture with two fingers on a trackpad. \nAs far as I know this only works with trackpads and is undocumented. It works on macOS High Sierra.\nThis is from a related question on AskDifferent: How do you rotate inserts in Apple Mac OS preview 7?\n\nA: This thread addresses the problem best: \nhttps://discussions.apple.com/message/16821750#16821750\nBasically the issue is with Acrobat formatting scanned PDFs in a way that makes Preview think it is rotated.  \nThe answer above about exporting to a new PDF and then trying to insert a scanned signature in the new PDF via Preview's annotation tools works to fix the problem.  \n\nA: To rotate the whole image:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the image file in Preview\n\n*Click \"Tools\" in the menubar\n\n*Click \"Rotate Left\" or \"Rotate Right\"\n\n\nTo rotate only part of the image\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the image file in Preview  \n\n*Select the signature part\n\n*Hit Command-x to cut or Command-c to copy\n\n*Hit Command-n to make a new file from the cut or copied part\n\n*Click \"Tools\" in the menubar\n\n*Click \"Rotate Left\" or \"Rotate Right\"\n\n*Hit Command-a to select all\n\n*Hit Command-c to Copy\n\n*In the first document, hit command-v to paste the rotated part\n\n*Copy and paste small background-colored areas to fill in where the original signature was\n\n\nA: I ran into this problem and found that I could work around it with File > Export…. After closing the original and opening the exported version, the signature orientation was correct.\n\nA: I ended up scanning a new signature in sideways via the camera. So now I have a rotated signature and a normal one should the issue come up again.\nHopefully Apple fixes this at some point.\n\nA: I've been having the same problem, but I solved it by opening the pdf file in Preview, hitting File > Duplicate, then adding the signature in the newly created file. This corrects the orientation of the file so that Preview can identify lines and you can just click on them with the signature tool (from the Annotate/Edit toolbar) and add your signature.\n\nA: I did not export it but I copied the signature on a blank Pages document.  I found that after I closed it, and reopened it, the orientation was correct. \n", "Q: When saving Open Office files they used to stay Open Office files, now they change to Terminal files It used to be that when I saved Open Office files they would stay Open Office files. Now, they change to Terminal files, as it keeps opening in my dock.\nHow can I remove or stop Terminal opening (I'm running a Macbook Air '11)?\nI'm so used to seeing my writing in Open Office files!\n\nA: Select any one of those Open Office files in a Finder window.

Near the bottom of that window you should see a pane that says \"Open with:\". \n\nIf it says \"Terminal,\" then click on the dialogue to bring up a drop-down menu, which will present you with a list of applications usually associated with that type of file.

The harddrive is also still blinking its light per usual and has not made any abnormal sounds. \nAny help would be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: So I know this was asked a very long time ago but for the sake of people landing on this page, here's what I know:\nIf it shows up in system utility and your drive is spinning (as mine is), that means your hard drive enclosure is functioning and the logic board inside is working as well. However, if it's not showing up in the disk utility then there is still an internal problem with the hard drive. Since it is at least partially functioning, it may be possible for a professional to be able to recover some or all of the data from the drive but you'll probably need to invest in a new one for future use.

Is it possible to just copy the plist file containing the signature from one Mac to another? Is there a recommended method for exporting and import signatures from one Mac to another I should follow instead?\nI could \"sign\" a blank PDF and take a screen shot of it but but I really want the same password to go along with the image so it's 100% the same signature on the other Mac as the one I'm using on this Mac.\n\nA: This was covered by Aussie Bloke's blog when Lion arrived. Here are the steps to get both the file where the signature is stored as well as the associated keychain entry to a second Mac.\nOn the source Mac:\n\n*\n\n*Open the ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.Preview/Data/Library/Preferences folder.\n\n*\n\n*In Finder, click the Go menu and hold option to show the Library folder.\n\n*Alternatively, press ⇧⌘G whilst Finder is active and enter the path above to directly navigate.\n\n\n\n*On OS X Mavericks 10.9 and earlier, copy the com.apple.Preview.signatures.plist file.\n\n*On OS X Yosemite 10.10 and later, copy the com.apple.PreviewLegacySignaturesConversion.plist file.\n\n*Launch Keychain Access\n\n*Ensure the login keychain is selected and choose the Passwords category.\n\n*On OS X Mavericks 10.9 and earlier, right-click the Preview Signature Privacy password and select Copy Password to Clipboard.  This is the password used to encrypt the signature images.\n\n*On OS X Yosemite 10.10 and later, right-click the Signature Annotation Privacy password and select Copy Password to Clipboard.\n\n*Paste it into a text editor and save the file.  You'll need to transfer this to your other computer(s).\n\nOn the destination Mac(s):\n\n*\n\n*Launch Preview, open Preferences, and select the Signatures tab to ensure the default configuration files and folders have been created.\n\n*Exit Preview.  Ensure that the process is terminated.\n\n*Open the ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.Preview/Data/Library/Preferences folder.\n\n*On OS X Mavericks 10.9 and earlier, copy the com.apple.Preview.signatures.plist file to the folder, overwriting any existing file.\n\n*On OS X Yosemite 10.10 and later, copy the com.apple.PreviewLegacySignaturesConversion.plist file to the folder, overwriting any existing file.\n\n*Launch Keychain Access\n\n*On OS X Mavericks 10.9 and earlier, locate the Preview Signature Privacy password in the login keychain and double-click to edit.\n\n*On OS X Yosemite 10.10 and later, locate the Signature Annotation Privacy password in the login keychain and double-click to edit.\n\n*Click the Show password checkbox and paste the password you copied from your original machine.\n\n*Click Save Changes and you're done!\n\nIn situations where the target machine has no existing Preview Signature Privacy or Signature Annotation Privacy record in Keychain Access, you must create a new record. This is necessary when the target machine (like a Mac Pro with an older or third-party display attached) has no camera which means no Signature file can be created from within Preview. Open Keychain Access as above and do the following:\n\n*\n\n*Click on the + icon to create a new entry\n\n*On OS X Mavericks 10.9 and earlier, enter Preview Signature Privacy in the Keychain Item Name field.\n\n*On OS X Yosemite 10.10 and later, enter Signature Annotation Privacy in the Keychain Item Name field.\n\n*Enter Preview in the Account Name field.\n\n*Paste the password copied from your original machine, per above procedure.\n\n*Click Add\n\n*In the newly created entry, click Access Control\n\n*Add Preview to applications allowed access\n\n*Click Save Changes and you're done!\n\n\nA: If your source Mac is portable (i.e. a laptop) then one crude but effective option I have just performed is to do the following:\nOn the source Mac:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open a new TextEdit document and go to File > Print\n\n*In the PDF dropdown menu select to open PDF in Preview. This will open your blank TextEdit document in Preview\n\n*Resize the blank Preview window to fill the screen\n\n*Insert your signature in the usual way Tools > Annotate > Signature and resize to be as large as possible\n\n\nOn the destination Mac:\n\n\n*\n\n*In Preview go to Tools > Annotate > Signature > Manage Signatures\n\n*Use the Camera option to make a new signature\n\n*Present (i.e. lift it up and show it) your source Mac to the camera on the destination Mac and this will detect the signature and store it\n\n\nI realise this is similar to scribbling on a sheet of paper and making a new signature in the destination Mac but if this is not to hand then this method has worked for me today. Hope it helps others.\n\nA: To accomplish the transfer of a signature from one machine to another on OS X Yosemite, El Capitan and onwards:\n1.  Follow the original answer but make the following alterations:\n2.  The file: com.apple.Preview.signatures.plist does not exist.\nInstead, copy: com.apple.PreviewLegacySignaturesConversion.plist.\n3.  The Keychain Access entry: Preview Signature Privacy does not exist.\nInstead, use: Signature Annotation Privacy.\n\nA: On Monterey, this solution worked for me. From this thread on discussions.apple.com:\nOn the Source Mac:\n\n*\n\n*Open Keychain Access\n\n*In Local Items find the \"Signature Annotation Privacy\"\n\n*Right-click the item and select \"Copy password to Clipboard\"\n\n*Open TextEdit and paste the password (note the password is long) and save the file as text\n\n*Transfer this file to the Destination Mac.\n\nOn the Destination Mac:\n\n*\n\n*Open any PDF in the Preview\n\n*Create a dummy signature using your trackpad and save it\n\n*Close Preview\n\n*Open Keychain Access\n\n*In Local Items find the \"Signature Annotation Privacy\" and double-click to open the item\n\n*Click on \"Show password\"\n\n*In the password field paste the text from the text file you created on the source Mac\n\n*Click on Save changes\n\n*Close Keychain Access\n\nThe signature will show up in place of the dummy signature in Preview.\n\nA: On Mac OS X High Sierra (Might be the case on Sierra as well, I can't recall) the signature itself is a base64 encoding of the image in the password field of Signature Annotation Privacy. Copy the account UUID and the content of the password field to your destination mac.\n\n(Create a bogus signature to make Preview create the entry if you're unsure on doing it by yourself)\n\nA: Actually you don't need all this long process to solve the problem. You just have to sync your Keychain with iCloud in both your Macs and then you'll have your signatures on both. It works, I've tried it right now on MacOS Mojave.\n\nA: MISSING KEYCHAIN ITEMS?\nIf the Preview Signature Privacy or Signature Annotation Privacy keychain item is missing from your destination Mac's Keychain Access, an easy way to add it is as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open your Preview app, and create a new signature which will later be replaced by your imported signature(s) from your source Mac. You can create multiple signatures here if you are planning to import multiple signatures from your source Mac.\n\n*Quit Preview app.\nThis should automatically create the missing Preview Signature Privacy or Signature Annotation Privacy keychain item(s) that you need to have in your Keychain Access.\n\n\nNOTE: If you are planning to migrate MULTIPLE signatures from your source Mac to your destination Mac(s), make sure to create a new signature for each signature that you plan to migrate. In other words, if you have 3 signatures you want to migrate, make sure you have created 3 Preview Signature Privacy or Signature Annotation Privacy keychain items in your Keychain Access.\n\nA: I had an issue on High Sierra where Preview would not save a new signature, and I was unable to restore signatures from another Mac. It turned out to be a corrupt Local Items keychain, which is where Preview stores the Signature Annotation Privacy password item. Since the Local Items keychain was not accepting new entries, Preview could not save new signatures.\nSolution: see this SO answer to resolve that problem. After doing that was able to add new keychain entries.\n", "Q: iPhone 5 can't restore even when using DFU mode I got this AT&T iPhone 5 purchased overseas for $800 plus tax.\nAs soon as I got it, I tried to restore it to bypass the activation screen required by AT&T. But restoring didn't go smooth as planned. Now the phone is stuck in recovery mode. And every time I place it in DFU mode, then restore with iTunes I get an error 21, if not in dfu mode 1603,1604, 1611 errors come out.\nWhen restoring using DFU mode, what I notice is that iTunes has the loading label ‘preparing to restore iPhone’. The device on the other hand turns off, and comes up with the Apple logo and the daisy/spinning wheel. The wheel spins for about a quarter only and get stuck, and soon after reboots and goes back to Apple logo. After that is the popular iTunes and USB logo. Then, iTunes gives an \"iPhone cannot be restored. An unknown error occurred (21)\" something error. The process repeats every time I try to restore in DFU mode.\nI've tried almost everything online relating to this issue: device off and hold home button while connecting the lightning connector and wait for the iTunes logo and USB to show up before releasing home button, for example. Done it for countless times, in 4 different computers.\nI've tried it on 2 PCs with Windows 7 64-bit, a MacBook Pro and a Windows XP. The IPSW file I'm using is the 6.0.1 for GSM which is appropriate for my GSM device.\nBeen stuck for almost a week now, will be really sad if this is a hardware failure, it would mean additional expense for warranty.\nAny other suggestions I should try for a fix? I really want to start using this device.\n\nA: I'm not really sure if we are in the same boat. I had been stuck in DFU mode after restoring my iPad to iOS 6.1 without activating it. I have tried using iTunes in restoring the firmware but it was stuck on the iTunes and usb logo just like you. What I did was to use redsn0w to restore my iPad. You can use it without jailbreaking your phone. Hope this helps.\n\nA: I found you a link for all of your errors. All the errors you listed have been gathered to a single Apple Support page. Click the error number to jump to the relevant section or specific page.\n\nA: I've got \"IPad could not be restored Unknown error (21)\" after upgrade to new version failed.\nThe following steps from https://discussions.apple.com/message/18064040#18064040\nallowed me to reset an  IPad, and then I've restored it from ICloud backup.\n\nPower off the iPad completely (wait for the progress spinner to\n  disappear).

After 10 seconds (the second time you'll see the\n  Apple logo on the screen) release the Sleep/Wake switch while still\n  holding the Home button.\n\n\nA: Solved by pushing it out of Recovery mode cycle by using ReiBoot (https://www.tenorshare.com/products/reiboot.html). I am sure there are some other apps that can do this too. It's very simple to do, I just installed it, run it, plug the iPhone in computer via USB. It detects the iPhone, offers a \"push out of recovery mode\" button of sort. Click the button and voila!\n", "Q: Can't delete music from iOS device in iTunes When I connect my iPod or iPhone to iTunes on a MacBook Pro, it will look like this picture attached. When I right-click on a song to delete it, there is no delete option. What am I doing wrong? This new iTunes has been so confusing.\n\n\nA: This is likely because iTunes is automatically syncing your music.\n\nWhen you automatically sync music, you manage what songs you have on your device by going to the music tab, and selecting which playlists/artists/genres/albums to sync or not sync.\nThe fix:\nTo manually manage music, click the Summary tab, scroll to close to the bottom, and in the Options area, there will be an option to Manually manage music and videos. Select this option, and you should be able to delete songs and such from the \"On this iPhone\" tab.\n\n\nA: This is on a different computer to mine. I knew to enable \"manually manage\" etc. however itunes wants to sync to the library on the new computer erasing all my music before I can apply the manaul management of my iphone library. Really annoying not to mention I don't want the phone backing up all the time, sync maybe but not backup too. Also the change of layout was confusing. why did it have to change the old way worked. \n", "Q: For bad and/or marginal blocks on hard disks, can anything be more effective than a single pass of zeros? There's a good discussion in Apple Support Communities –\nDisk Utility: for bad blocks on hard disks, are seven overwrites any more effective than a single pass of zeros? (2011-04-21)\nA highlight: \n\nMaybe a better way of phrasing my original question … defocusing from\n  Disk Utility, considering the secureErase verb of diskutil: \n  \n  \n*\n  \n*is a random fill pattern — or the first pass of any type of \n  fill pattern associated with level 2, 3 or 4 — any more likely than \n  a pattern of zeros to trigger spare block substitution?  \n  \n  \n  The October 2010 post by Grant Bennet-Alder seems clear enough \n  re: the effect of a pattern of zeros. \nStill, I'd like to leave this question open/unanswered for\n  a while, in case people have anything to add concerning fill patterns\n  for spare block substitution purposes.\n\nGrant Bennet-Alder wrote: \n\n\n…  the substitution will happen on the first re-write with Zeroes. \n    More passes just takes longer.\n\n\n– that is: the first re-write, not the first write. \n\nA good discussion but for me, not conclusive. Plus I very recently received, in private, additional information about approaches to blocks that are marginal. \nI can't change the title in Apple Support Communities, and ASC prevents discussion in some places, so a move to Ask Different is timely.\nNote, at least one linked question (to the right) …\n\nA: \nThanks – that's the first write, which is reportedly not enough. In an edition to your answer, can you explain why in alternative advice, there's emphasis on the first re-write\n  Blockquote\n\nI'm not sure I'm following your question.\nWhen a drive detects an unwritable, or bad sector, it's supposed to mark the unwritable block as bad, then re-map the bad sector to a spare sector. It makes no difference what type of data is contained in the data to be written to the drive. This will happen until the amount of spare sectors are used up. After they are, then with most drives, the bad sector is simply left in place and the drive should be considered bad.\nFrom the post from your Apple link, I would tend to agree more with Martin Joseph than some of the others. If the number of bad sectors is increasing with any degree of regularity, then it likely means bearings are failing in either the actuator or the drive motor. This allows too much play in the mechanisms and results in more and more head crashes as the problem gets worse, which causes more and more bad sectors. Either the drive will fail from mechanical problem (bad bearings,) the heads will eventually become damaged, or the platters will become so damaged no more spare sectors will be available and they'll just be left on the drive platters to cause more and more problems.\nIf the bad sector problem is due to a one time head crash (impact or a small particle entering the drive chamber) it's quite possible that the drive may be corrected by \"zeroing\" and may last years.\nThe only time a multi-pass overwrite would be needed that I could think of would be to \"clear\" weak sectors. The amount of time it takes to read a weak sector should raise a flag to the controller, but if the amount of time never exceeds the drive's threshold it won't be re-mapped. With weak sectors, the amount of time to read it may vary enough that at one point it might actually, finally flag the sector as failed and re-map it.\nThe process of \"zeroing\" the drive is really something of a misnomer. You could fill the blocks with \"Hello, World!\" data and it should still remap the bad sectors if spares are available. The reason people suggest using the \"zeroing\" technique is because it's built into Disk Utility, not as a drive repair procedure but as a security procedure. It just incidentally happens to force the controller to remap bad sectors when it encounters them.\nI would suggest the term \"re-write\" refers to the fact that the sector once held data and now, in the zeroing or overwriting process it's being re-written.\n\nA: I take the following to mean that YES, 7-pass (or 3-pass) may find more bad blocks than a single pass, by the mere fact that some blocks may be, well, \"iffy\" and need more than one pass to be found and excluded.  Please correct me if I am misinterpreting the following: \n\n[T]he Zero Out Data option... will trigger the drive's built-in Spare Bad Blocks routine.... [I]f you're going to be committing important\n  data to the drive, you may wish to run... a drive stress test... to\n  exercise the drive, by writing and reading data from as many locations\n  as possible for as much time as you can spare.... [A]ny weak spot will\n  show itself now instead of sometime down the road.\n\nFrom: \nRevive a Hard Drive for Use With Your Mac\n\nScanning for Bad Blocks\nThis next step will check every location of the drive and determine\n  that each section can have data written to it, and the correct data\n  read back. In the process of performing this step, the utilities we\n  use will also mark any section that is unable to be written to or read\n  from as a bad block. This prevents the drive from using these areas\n  later....\nWhen Disk Utility uses the Zero Out Data option, it will trigger the\n  drive's built-in Spare Bad Blocks routine as part of the erasure\n  process.... \n[I]f you're going to be committing important data to the drive, you\n  may wish to run one more test. This is a drive stress test, sometimes\n  referred to as a burn-in. The purpose is to exercise the drive, by\n  writing and reading data from as many locations as possible for as\n  much time as you can spare. The idea is that any weak spot will show\n  itself now instead of sometime down the road.\nThere are a few ways to perform a stress test, but in all cases, we\n  want the entire volume to be written to and read back. Once again, we\n  will use two different methods.\nStress Test With Disk Utility\nWhen Disk Utility uses the DOE-compliant 3-pass secure erase, it will\n  write two passes of random data and then a single pass of a known data\n  pattern.  [Or 7-pass will write over data 7 times.]  ... Once the\n  erasure is complete, if Disk Utility shows no errors, you're ready to\n  use the drive knowing it's in great shape.\n\n\nA: Theoretically one pass should suffice. The way it works is like this:\n\n\n*\n\n*The controller will detect the bad sector during an attempted write.\n\n*The write fails.\n\n*The controller removes that sector from the list of available sectors and points it to a spare sector, if any are left on the drive.\n\n\nThe problem you might run into will occur if the sector is a weak sector vs. a bad sector. A weak sector is one that can be read and written to but the signal the controller detects is weak, and it takes a lot of attempts to read such a sector but not necessarily write to it. The controller may not mark this sector as bad, even though it may end up bottlenecking your system if it's in a file that's read frequently.\nThe number of passes shouldn't make any difference. The fact that zeros are being written is irrelevant. It could be any data. Zeros are selected because as a security option it's writing a binary 0 into all the empty blocks.\n", "Q: How can I automatically run an AppleScript on shutdown or logout?

Why does pressing the red X close some windows, and seemingly minimize others?\n\nA: Mac OS has always had a multiple document interface. Applications like TextEdit can have multiple main windows open without requiring multiple instances. The open command doesn't usually open documents over the current document.\nThe close button might also quit the application after closing the last window like on Windows. But what if you want to create a new document? Many applications create an untitled document on startup. Should closing it quit the application?\nThere's no real harm in keeping applications running in the background. They don't usually use CPU, and you should have enough free or inactive memory anyway. Quitting and opening applications all the time would take more time. OS X has also supported automatic termination since 10.7.\n\nAutomatic termination eliminates the need for users to quit an app. Instead, the system manages app termination transparently behind the scenes, terminating apps that are not in use to reclaim needed resources such as memory.\n[...]\nAutomatic termination transfers the job of managing processes from the user to the system, which is better equipped to handle the job. Users do not need to manage processes manually anyway. All they really need is to run apps and have those apps available when they need them. Automatic termination makes that possible while ensuring that system performance is not adversely affected.\nApps must opt in to both automatic termination and sudden termination and implement appropriate support for them.\n\nThe close button does actually quit some applications with a single main window, like Dictionary, System Preferences, and Calculator. Opening them again doesn't take that long and quitting them frees users from having to do it manually.\n", "Q: New to OS X - How do I navigate through finder? I am used to Windows because I simply go to computer and can click my partition and see my entire file structure right there.

Can anyone give me tips on these two problems?\n\nA: You can drag the home and root folders to the sidebar. They used to be there by default, but they were removed in 10.7.\n\nI have also removed all of the default locations, so the root folder of column view windows is always ~/ or /.\n⇧⌘G opens a Go to Folder sheet. It can also be opened by pressing ~ or / in file dialogs.\n\nYou can show the path at the bottom by checking View > Show Path Bar:\n\nThere is also a hidden preference for showing the path on the title bar:\ndefaults write com.apple.finder _FXShowPosixPathInTitle -bool true\nkillall Finder\n\n\nA: How to Navigate MacBook (Yosemite) File System:\nSpecifically:  Click into \"Finder\" and select Preferences, and turn them all on, so everything shows.  Make sure to click-on \"MacHD\" or \"HD\" for the \"HardDisk\".  Then you will get a little HardDisk icon on your desktop.  Click on that to see the file-system (I have \"Yosemite\" version on this MacBook...)\nOn the window-panel that opens of the \"Macintosh HD\", click the goofy little box at the top that shows a glyph of a bunch of horizontal lines.  That will give a sane and actionable display of your file system.\nYou should see a sub-dir called: \"users\".  That will have a sub-dir which should correspond to your user-name, and have your user-specifc stuff in it.\nHow to Rename a Directory:\nNow, if you navigate thru the sub-dirs and files, you will notice that you cannot rename a directory.  Silly, but it actuall is possible.  You have to double-click (on the weird flat-panel press-plate, you press two fingers down together...).  This opens a big panel of stuff, and what you want is \"Get Info\".  Click on this, and you finally get a sane panel, on screen left, with useful, actionable information.  One of the things you can see, is a text-box with the sub-directory name in it.  There, you can rename the directory by just keying in a new name.\nAnother Idea to Consider: VirtualBox or a proper Linux O/S...\nThis particular Macbook OS is a frustrating experience for many people.  I have to go to terminal mode to do anything with the file system. (( I had written an abusive rant here, but I removed it.  )) The entire graphical UI on top of the unix-style underlying software (that actually is not bad), is almost toxic.  I don't recommend wiping the MacBook default O/S, unless you are comfortable installing O/S software on the bare metal.  But you might consider something like Ubuntu, or CentOS Linux.  The other thing you might do, which I have done in frustration, and disgust, is to install and configure VirtualBox, and install several instances of old Windows-XP, so I could at least get some work done.\nI am completely serious.  This has worked way better than I expected.  It is a bit of work, but it is possible to make it work very well.\nThe \"Finder\" thing just a really bad idea.  The MacBook Pro hardware is very good, but the software is annoying and frustrating. But this is the trend now, what with government entities demanding \"backdoor\" access so they can monitor and track computer users, and companies hiding most of their special \"features\" so they can capture revenue streams from \"apps\" that make the technology usable.  It will only get worse.  Try to take time to learn Linux/Unix.  Buy an old P/C, wipe the hard-disk, and install some kind of Linux.  Then, you will understand what the awful MacBook O/S is built on top of.  The old underlying NeXT (Unix-style) software architecture is very good.  What is sad is how Apple is hiding this from folks with an annoyingly cryptic and complex graphical user interface.  Best of luck.  \n", "Q: Is it possible to install and boot Windows on a Thunderbolt drive? I know the BIOS emulation of the EFI firmware in Macs does not support booting from FireWire or USB drives, and the EFI version of Windows doesn't seem to be compatible with Apple's EFI implementation, so you can't install or boot Windows from one of those. But Thunderbolt drives are really just PCIe SATA controllers with one or more SATA disks attached, much like internal drives.\nI have read that you can boot OSX from at least some Thunderbolt hard disks and SSDs. So is it possible to boot Windows off such a drive? And can you suggest any specific models of disks or Thunderbolt-SATA adapters that support this?\nI realise that the Boot Camp assistant might not cooperate as the drive is \"external\", but the assistant is just for partitioning. You can prepare the disk's partition table manually, so the main question is if the Mac's firmware will boot an MBR-based OS from a Thunderbolt drive.\nObviously I could just go and buy a Thunderbolt drive and try it out but they're pretty expensive compared to otherwise equivalent and more universally compatible USB3 drives. Also, support is likely to vary between models, so chances are I'd pick up the wrong one.\n\nA: Other people have got it working:\nhttp://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=1351547 \nOr if you have a retina MacBook Pro:\nhttp://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=1414769&page=5\n\nA: I’ve not tried MBR1… but: you can indeed boot Windows 7 and Windows 8 (64-bit versions) in EFI mode off of a Thunderbolt-connected disk.  I have a handful of the Buffalo Ministation Thunderbolt2 drives with the original, slow 5400 rpm hard drives replaced with various SSDs, and they work wonderfully3.  You can boot off of them by pressing Option during the chime at bootup, and they show as an orange-colored \"EFI Disk\" in the selection options.\nNow, the trick is getting Windows installed on the disk in EFI mode, because when you stated that \"the EFI version of Windows doesn't seem to be compatible with Apple's EFI implementation,\" I assume that means (like me), you tried, and it just refused to install.  Well, to my knowledge, that's correct — however, the only part that isn't 'compatible' is the install process — whatever Windows tries to do to the EFI partition just before it goes to reboot doesn't work out right.\n&nbsp\nSolution to the rescue: install VMware Fusion on your Mac (even the trial will do) and use Vijay Pandurangan’s blog post to help you mount your external Thunderbolt drive directly to a new VM.  Pay special attention to the comment at the bottom of the post:  Hajo makes it much, much easier.\nPartition the drive as GPT with OS X, and/or install an extra copy of OS X on the Thunderbolt disk first (if you wish) and leave free space for Windows.  If you’re not planning to have a spare copy of OS X to boot from this drive, leave all the space blank (don’t partition beyond the EFI partition OS X will initialize with GPT).\nSet the VM to boot with EFI, and install Windows 7 or Windows 8 (has to be a 64-bit flavor to support EFI) directly to the disk.  Now, once Windows has gone through its setup process, and it counts down for a restart, shut the VM down.  That’s right - you're done with Fusion4,5, and you can go straight to booting from your new drive.  Seriously.  Press Option on boot, and you will indeed see \"EFI Boot\" as an option, you can choose it, and Windows on Thunderbolt you will have.\nI don't expect you would have any issue booting from any other standard Thunderbolt drive either, especially if it is an AHCI SATA drive like the Buffalo.\n&nbsp\nWhile I’m fairly confident that you could get plain-old MBR-based Boot Camp to work, why would you?  EFI is the future, and once you go through the process, you can boot your Thunderbolt Windows disk from just about any new Mac5.\n\n1 I haven't had the need for it, yet.  There isn't an OS, or utility I've needed to run on my Macs that doesn't have EFI support, and I have an aversion to looking back and strongly feel MBR is looking back — like 1983 called, and wants its 10MB MFM hard drive back, back.\n2 The original disk worked fine too, but gaaah! so sloooww.\n3 Brian Klug wrote a really excellent review on this particular drive on AnandTech, and that's what convinced me to buy it.  It's a beautiful piece of equipment, with fit-and-finish like Apple, comes with both a Thunderbolt and USB 3 connector and cables! to match.  Yes, the included drive is slow as all get out, but you can replace it with just about any 2.5\" HDD or SSD of your choosing.  Just make sure you have a hair dryer.\n4 Unless, you're not.  I use both interchangeably.  You can boot directly into Windows 8 on hardware, and you can boot into it from Fusion using this configuration when the need strikes you, like you're working on something, don’t want to reboot, but need to open a .PST file in Outlook 2013… for instance.\n5 Windows licensing issues notwithstanding; you’re going to have to buy a copy of Windows for every machine you want to boot it on for long-term use in order to not get black backgrounds and \"this copy is not genuine\" type errors.\n\n\nA: The only way I found to make this happen was to just create a small (20 gig, smallest possible) bootcamp partition on the internal drive, then let Windows 7 setup start, and just select the external Thunderbolt drive (in my case, a Lacie Rugged with a Samsung SSD inside) as installation target.\nGranted, it's not \"pure external\" as solution, but W7 definitly boots of the thunderbolt SSD that way, which is what you're asking.\nDownsides : you can't reclaim that 20 gig on the internal drive : destroying it will render your W7 on the Thunderbolt useless. And your hibernation goes out of the window.\nUpsides : huge speed improvement on W7. After drive recognition (which takes a while, but does so too on most PC hardware) W7 starts up in 15 seconds flat. And as you're installing W7 \"the right way\", you don't have to worry about ssd alignement or optimalisations : W7 does most (not all) of those by itself, including support for trim, disabling defrag and that kind of stuff. The solution turned out tot be stable even after a couple of months working.\nI've tried all other methods that involed cloning bootcamp in some way, but results were negative on a Imac 27 late 12. \nI was a bit worried about power ratings of the buspowered Lacie Thunderbolt, but the used Samsung SSD has a measured max power drain of about 3.5 Watt in fully stressed write and 0,35 or something in idle,. The Thunderbolt port is rated to 10Watt, so that shouldn't be a problem, not even in the long run.\nIt looks a bit odd having that Lacie around as W7 boot disc, but it works very well and does the Imac justice running Windows, as performance on the internal fusion drive was abysmal in regards to the Imac's harware.\n\nA: I have a dual boot of Windows 7 and Windows 10 Running on my MacBook Pro Late 2012, on an external ThunderBolt 2 LaCie Drive.  I cloned the Windows 7 and 10 from my Desktop to a LaCie Rugged 1TB drive plugged into my desktop's ThunderBolt port.  It works very well for both Win7 and Win10. \n The LaCie has a very slow Seagate 1TB HDD so I cloned the contents to a Samsung Evo 850 500GB. Windows is very fast but it does take a long time to recognize The Windows disk, perhaps 30 sec to a minute or so.  The Mac OS-X is on a RAID-0 array comprised of 2 Samsung 1TB evo 850. \nI have tried connecting the LaCie drive to the same Mac via USB 3.0 and get a blue screen as I expected. \nI am running Windows on MBR not efi.

It only logs normal process activity like load, errors, warnings, etc.\nCertain user activity that can causes a major change in the program’s behaviour will also be logged. Opening and saving documents is one such activity.\nAutomator logs your password because it doesn’t know you are entering your password; it only knows that keyboard input is being received. Recording actions in Automator is very literal. It records the points being clicked, not the buttons. It records the delay between two actions; it does not detect if a previous action has completed or not. Similarly, it records the buttons being pressed, not what those buttons do or even if the key presses are for a text field or a game.\n\nA: The answer is 2 sided.\n\n*\n\n*No Console.app doesn't log anything. Console.app simply display logfiles feeded by applications and MacOS X itself.\n\n\n*Yes you can see clear text password logged with Console.app.\nHow such a password disclosure may happen?\nHere are the causes by order of decreasing probability:\n\n*\n\n*I inadvertantly typed my password within an admin right checking window.\nI didn't notice that this window was first asking me an admin account and I typed there my password. This one is duly registered in /var/log/secure.log as if it is an admin account.\n\n\n*I typed my password within a badly conceived software which will log it in /var/log/system.log with some other pieces of information. This may be due to either an internal debugging function or a tracking function.\nKeyboard sniffers and RATs are some dangerous piece of software\nwhich see passwords in clear (they may even see much more\nconfidential pieces of information). Hence they must be very\ncarefully coded so as to avoid any leak of the information they\nsee.\nIn case n° 1: you just have to change it and do the same change wherever\nyou used the same password.\nIn case n° 2: same corrective action concerning your disclosed password.\nAnd you could signal the problem to the author of the software if you think they are among the software editors who may understand and fix this security vulnerability.\n\nA: Console.app shows what processes have written to files or syslog or the Apple logger. What gets written there depends on the application and what the developers have decided to write. I have seen apps where bad developers have left debug logging in but these are very rare.\nIf the developers use the Apple authentication framework to get a password for an admin user then the application does not see the password so the application cannot write it to a log.\nAs @duci9y says Autimator does not know that this is a password and so just treats it like any text,  writing it to stdout.\n\nA: No, Console.app does not log passwords in plaintext.\n", "Q: Macbook Air 2011 only wakes from sleep if plugged in I've had trouble getting my macbook air (with 10.7) to wake up.

I use an American AppleTV in a Latin American country and it works just fine as long as your TV have the required HDMI input.\nHowever the content your AppleTV will show varies from country to country, as the iTunes catalog of Movies and TV Series is region specific. You can check what movies and series you will be able to buy or rent using Tunes on your computer.

This is all well and good when I want to listen to something on a shared library when I'm at my computer, but doesn't work at all on anything iOS.\nCan anyone here explain why Apple has disabled access to normal shared iTunes libraries on iOS? As far as I can tell, it is no longer possible to access a normal shared iTunes library from any iOS device using any known Apple iOS software. You can now configure \"Home Sharing\", but that feature seems almost completely useless to me. I can see no advantages to Home Sharing over normal local network shared iTunes libraries, which are still entirely functional over desktop iTunes.\nI have also not been able to find any online discussion of this issue whatsoever; no similar complaints, no explanations of why Apple disabled normal shared library access on iOS, nothing. If anyone has any information whatsoever, or a functional workaround that does not use Home Sharing (I don't want to have to ask someone to manually type in a different Apple ID to access their shared library in my house, and we're not all going to post our Apple IDs and passwords on the wall), please let me know.\n\nA: Why not make an new shared apple id that you can all use specifically for home sharing.\nThen you get to tap \"more\" then \"sharing\" in the iOS music app.\n\nA: I have a functional workaround, which requires three additional pieces of software. Yes, that's right, getting music from a normal shared iTunes library (called \"shared music\" by Apple: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT2688) on an iOS device requires four pieces of software.\nOn the iOS device, get Apple's \"Remote\" app. Configure it to control iTunes on your desktop. Grab a copy of Rogue Amoeba's \"AirFoil Speakers\" for the iOS device. Then fire up Rogue Amoeba's \"AirFoil\" on the desktop (available for Mac and Win), select iTunes as the source, and the iOS device as the destination. \"AirFoil Speakers\" on the iOS device must be open to initially select it from \"AirFoil\" on the desktop, but can be switched away from after that. Finally, fire up \"Remote\" on the iOS device, select More > Shared then the shared iTunes library you want to listen from. This will open that shared library in iTunes on your desktop, which you can then control from the iOS device.\nThis is perhaps the most roundabout way of listening to music from one device on another possible, but it's what you have to do to listen to an old-style shared iTunes library on an iOS device. Stupid, isn't it? Couldn't they just include old-fashioned shared library support in the iOS \"Music\" app?\n", "Q: \"New Screenshot\" button is disabled in XCode Organizer I have connected my iPhone to my Mac.. \nWhen I open XCode Organizer, the New Screenshot button is disabled.. \nAny idea why???\nXCode Version 4.3.2\niOS 6.0.1\n\n\nA: *\n\n*Select the iDevice\n\n*Click \"Use for development\"\n\n*Enter your Apple ID and password\n\n\nNow you should be able to take screenshots.\n", "Q: iTunes 11 reverts to season 1 of a show after watching an episode Since upgrading to iTunes 11 with it's wonderful interface I've run into an issue.

I know Objective-C is the recommended language for mac app store apps. What if I would like to write a mac app with python? Will my app be rejected when published?\n\nA: The App Store will accept any binary as long as it doesn't require anything that isn't included with the system or in the binary. Because Mac OS X includes Python, it should be acceptable. There are a variety of libraries and helpful tools for writing Mac apps in Python such as Py2app and PyObjC. Some developers have successfully used them to write apps and get them on the app store.\nRelevant guidelines from Apple:\n\n2.14 Apps must be packaged and submitted using Apple's packaging technologies included in Xcode - no third party installers allowed\n  2.15 Apps must be self-contained, single application installation bundles, and cannot install code or resources in shared locations\n  2.16 Apps that download or install additional code or resources to add functionality or change their primary purpose will be rejected\n\n", "Q: internet connection problems with the iphone 3 i have had an iphone 3 for a year. no problems! i recently updated my iphone to ios 6, it was fine for a day, and then suddenly, my facebook, instagram and whatsapp/kik stopped working, i was still able to access twitter and snapchap though. Why isn't my iphone allowing me to access certain internet based apps? it simply won't load. please help!\n\nA: I've had this issue on my iPhone too after update to iOS6, I had to reset the network settings. This will clear all remembered WIFI networks and force you to connect to them again, creating new network settings. This means you will have to manually connect to your WIFI network again, and if required enter its password afterwards.\nYou can reset the network settings by selecting:\nSettings -> General -> Reset -> Reset Network Settings\nAlso what can help is trying to clear the history of your Safari browser, you can do that by going to the Bookmarks -> History and then press the Clear button on the lower left hand corner of the screen.\n", "Q: When opening my MacBook Pro, the Superdrive makes noise I have a MacBook Pro mid-2012 and I love the easy way of putting it to sleep when closing the laptop. I have never used the SuperDrive.\nThe problem is that after several months of using it and getting it out of sleep correctly when I open the screen, now when I open the screen, the SuperDrive makes noise, just like at startup. It never did that before. \nI hate having such a noise when coming out from sleep. Is there a way to disable the SuperDrive?\n\nA: There's an option to disable Super-drive in parental controls. Check in system preferences -> Parental control.\nEdit\nOk if you want to do completely disable the superdrive without playing with parental control you can do it by unloading the kext file. Just go to /System/Library/Extensions folder and find IODVDStorageFamily.kext file. Move this file to any alternate location or create a new folder there itself and put it there and reboot. You won't see the superdrive in your connected devices again.  \nTo use the superdrive again, you need to put that file again on the same location and insert a USB drive, so that OSX starts searching for connected devices and it'll find your superdrive. Do take the backup of you kext file properly and do not delete it.\n", "Q: Expunge a corrupted Excel program All my downloaded spreadsheets are going to Excel which is totally corrupted.

After a clean install of Mac OS X Mountain Lion, I noticed a few problems that made the whole user experience nearly unbearable: constant beach ball cursors and unexpected freezes and pauses (up to one minute) when editting basic system preferences, copying files, using Safari, etc. Agility 3 SSDs have their own Trim manager, so I applied no hacks whatsoever. Here's what I've done so far:\n\n\n*\n\n*Made several clean installs of Mac OS X Lion on the SSD: all problems persisted;\n\n*Enabled Mac OS X native Trim support, using Trim Enabler: didn't notice any changes;\n\n*Didn't install any software and didn't use the HD: all problems persisted;\nRan a \"Verify disk\" scan using Disk Utility: no issues returned.\n\n\nI assume the problem is related to the SSD, because these beach balls and pauses started happening right after I installed the SSD. I do notice my Mac Book Pro is much faster though, whenever these issues don't freeze it. These are my relevant specs:\nMacBook Pro 5.1 (late 2008):\n\n\n*\n\n*2.4 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo;\n\n*8 GB 1067 MHz DDR3;\n\n*SMC version: 1.33f8;\n\n*Sudden Motion Sensor: Enabled.\n\n\nAgility 3 SSD:\n\n\n*\n\n*Model: OCZ-AGILITY3;\n\n*Revision: 2.220000;\n\n*Serial Number: OCZ-F2YXP9LB8741651B;\n\n*Native Command Queuing: Yes;\n\n*Queue Depth: 32;\n\n*Medium Type: Solid State;\n\n*TRIM Support: No;\n\n*Partition Map Type:   GPT (GUID Partition Table);\n\n*S.M.A.R.T. status: Verified.\n\n\nHere are some similar issues I found when browsing through Apple discussion forums, all with the very same Agility 3 SSDs:\n\n\n*\n\n*Macbook late 2009 - SATA III SSD issues\n\n*SSD beach ball freezes\n\n*occasional stalling\nI guess I should be more specific and run some sort of diagnostics, but I honestly don't know how to do it. Is there anything I should do to provide more information on this issue? Any suggestions would be much appreciated, as I totally depend on this MacBook Pro to work and procrastinate.\nQuick update: I just checked my System Report and my SSD is running (only) at SATA I speed, while it should only have backwards compatibility with SATA II. Maybe that's the problem. I just don't understand why it's not running at SATA II speed, as is the other HD I have on my Mac Book Pro (which, by the way, only supports up to SATA II).\n\nA: This may also be an issue with the ICH8-M AHCI SATA interface chip. I have a late 2008 MBP that came with a 250 GB HD. I upgraded to a 640 GB and had endless beach balls. Turns out the models with a ICH8-M AHCI and a PATA superdrive interface cannot be upgraded higher than a 320 GB 7200rpm HD. Anything faster or larger will stall out as the FW for the ICH8-M AHCI cannot be upgraded beyond SATA I speed without killing the PATA interface.\nSome models with a ICH8-M AHCI and a SATA superdrive interface can be upgraded with a FW update released by Apple.\nCheck for updates.\n\nA: If you are restoring from a time machine backup you could try creating another user and see if that user has similar problems.\nIf the problems persist, since you updated the hardware yourself, you may not have the cable seated properly. I know it is a pain, but you should open up the MacBook remove and reconnect the cable. I had similar problems when I installed a hard drive and that was the cause.\n\nA: I just solved the issue by updating the SSD firmware and applying a link speed fix (1.5Gb/s to 3Gb/s). Everything runs smoothly and fast now: no beach balls, no freezes. The SSD is only backwards compatible with SATA II (3Gb/s) and it was running at SATA I speed (1.5Gb/s), so maybe that's what was causing the freezes and beach balls.\nThere are two ways of updating your EFI; via a usb or by downloading a file from Apple, running it and rebooting. if you cannot boot because of freezes (it freezes during intensive operations like encryption for example - if that's enabled) then your only option is to create a bootable EFI upgrade (or downgrade) pen drive and update that way. Or can also try booting into safe mode with the shift key, that can help sometimes.\nIt is being said that the graphics chip used in mid 2009 MacBook Pros is the culprit.\n", "Q: How do you list clients connected to OS X Server 10.8's VPN?

The youtube video is subtitled, how can I turn it on on my Apple TV?\nI tried configuring languages and closed caption, but didn't work.\n\nA: The Apple TV doesn't support YouTube closed captioning.\nThe closed captioning you've enabled is where video files have subtitles.\nThe same functionality was missing on the pre-iOS 6 YouTube app, so I'm not surprised that it doesn't exist on the Apple TV.\nIf you want to submit feedback to Apple about this, you can do so here.\n", "Q: How to type keyboard shortcuts like ⌘Ä, ⌘Ö, ⌘Ü, etc. on a US keyboard? I'm using a Mac laptop with German set as the preferred language (the keyboard, however, is a standard US keyboard).  With this setting, some keyboard shortcuts include the characters Ä, Ö, and Ü.  E.g. ⌘Ä (command-Ä), ⌘Ö (command-Ö), ⌘Ü (command-Ü), etc.\nNow, I produce Ä by first pressing ⌥-u (Option-u), and then pressing ⇧-a (Shift-a).  I can't figure out any way of using this method to produce the equivalent of ⌘Ä (command-Ä).  The same goes for for Ö and Ü.\nIs there some way to produce these keyboard shortcuts on a US keyboard?\n\nA: This may seem metaphysical, but you cannot press a key that does not exist. Despite the lack of a physical Ä key on the U.S. Keyboard, you can, however set the keyboard layout to the German keyboard layout. Alternately, you could create a modified keyboard layout starting from the standard U.S. Keyboard layout that includes a Ä key.\nThe operation of changing the layout is the simplest to accomplish:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to System Preferences » Language & Text » Input Sources \n\n*Enable the German layout (and also make sure the \"Show Input menu in menu bar\" box is checked).\n\n*In the Input menu, select the German layout. \n\n\nThen, pressing the physical ⌘' keys will produce the ⌘Ä sequence. Likewise for ⌘; producing ⌘Ö and ⌘[ producing ⌘Ü. After typing that keystroke, you can use the menu to switch back to your desired keyboard layout.\n\nA: You can change the shortcuts from System Preferences:\n\nThey can also be changed with defaults. The shortcut format is described in the Cocoa Text System article.\n#!/bin/bash\n\ndefaults write -g NSUserKeyEquivalents '{\n\"Vorherigen Tab auswahlen\" = \"~@\\UF702\";\n\"Nächsten Tab auswahlen\" = \"~@\\UF703\";\n\"Zurück\" = \"@\\UF702\";\n\"Vorwärts\" = \"@\\UF703\";\n}'\n\n", "Q: Mac has enough memory, but still pages in, is that a problem? I recently upgraded my memory, but I notice that while the OS does NOT page out at all (from what I see in Activity Monitor), the machine pages in regardless.\nWhy does that happen? Is that a problem?\n\nA: This is normal, and you couldn't do anything without it.\nPaging in means loading something from the disk for the program. It does not have to be something that was previously paged out. For example, when you open a program its code has to be loaded. If you haven't used it recently, it's probably not in memory, so it has to be loaded. This counts as a page in. In order to not have any page ins, you would have to prevent the system from running any process, including those which are part of the boot sequence.\n", "Q: FaceTime call from Mac to iPhone 4S over 3G doesn't connect I tried to FaceTime my brother (who is using an iPhone 4s) from my MacBook Pro using the FaceTime app. The iPhone is on a 3G network, the MacBook is on my own Wi-Fi network.  \nThe FaceTime app doesn't say that the iPhone is unavailable; it just keeps trying to connect, but the iPhone doesn't ring or do anything.\nWhat might be the problem?\n\nA: I have the same problem. I assume that your brother's iPhone is on iOS 6 (which officially comes with the cellular FaceTime feature) and uses AT&T (which blocks this feature). I've heard someone say AT&T might start letting all iPhones use cellular FaceTime, but I believe the official word is that cellular FaceTime only works with AT&T if you have a Mobile Share plan or if you have an iPhone 5. Meanwhile you'll have to call him with Skype or Google Hangout, or he'll have to go to WiFi.\n\nA: Has your brother updated his phone to iOS 6?\nIf he has a jailbroken iPhone on iOS 5, he can use this.\nAnd if you're in the US, this might help. To bypass all of this, just have him go on Wi-fi.\n", "Q: Using dictation in the command line (e.g. transcribe an audio recording to a text file) I have some audio recordings and would like to transcribe them into text files. I was wondering whether there is a command line tool that could use the built-in Dictation to do that? And if so, is there a known duration limit?\n\nA: Dictation only works in standard text input UI widgets.

All the labels box with all the eight colors and the x.\n\n\nI don't use any of them and they only quit me some space.\nIs it possible to achieve that?\n\nA: It is possible to remove some items from The Finder's context menu in the Keyboard preference pane, it is not however possible to remove the specific ones you have asked about, at least as far as I can tell.  If you would like to try and remove some of the other items, go to System Preferences --> Keyboard and select the keyboard shortcuts tab.  Select \"Services\" from the list on the left hand side and then scroll down to the \"Files & Folders\" heading on the left hand side.  From here you can select which items to keep and which to remove.  As  I said, there is no option to remove \"Burn\" or \"Labels\" but at this point I don't think that is possible.  I'll certainly keep searching for you though.\n\nA: This might work.\nI couldn't find Burn to disc or Labels there though. there might be a terminal command the I am unfamiliar with though.\n", "Q: External monitor option for MacBook AIr I understand it is possilble to connect an external monitor to my MacBook Air.

My computer is a 15\" Macbook Pro with Retina display, and I'm on OS X version 10.8.2. I have had this my computer for several months. \nIn the past few days, the computer has been completely \"hanging\", where nothing moves on the screen except the mouse pointer. If I was on a Skype call, the call goes on like normal, but I can't do anything else on my computer. Gestures don't work, so I can't switch desktops. I can't use my keyboard to quit the current application. I can't click on anything. The entire screen is completely unresponsive. The only way out is to force the computer to shut down. Then it boots up normally. It's only been happening recently, and I haven't been able to identify the cause.\nCould it just be a bug that Apple needs to fix? Is there a process/app that could cause this to happen? How do I determine what caused the computer to hang?\nEdit: In the Console, I do see this message many times before the reboot:\n1/12/13 7:03:46.000 PM kernel[0]: vtd[0] fault: device 1:0:0 reason 0x5 W:0x1130e000\n\nI have no idea what this means, but I thought it might be related because it does happen immediately before the bootup entry.\nEdit 2: On other freezes, I see this message before a boot:\n1/12/13 9:06:51.000 PM kernel[0]: NVDA(OpenGL): Channel exception! exception type = 0xd = GR: SW Notify Error\n\nEdit 3: The problem was a faulty graphics card. I sent my computer in to Apple a while ago and they replaced the logic board, and when I got it back everything was hunky dory.\n\nA: If you can't launch or switch programs (I find Spotlight is a good way to do this if everything else is hanging, just hit ⌘Space, but it may not work in your case), you could enable SSH access ahead of time, and then use another device to log in and check what's hogging your CPU.\nOpen Sharing Preferences and enable Remote Login. Then you can connect via SSH from another Mac, PC or iOS device (you'll need PuTTY on Windows, and one of various SSH clients available on iOS). Once you're logged in, type top -o cpu to get an updating display of processes ranked by CPU usage. That should give you a hint as to what's causing the problems.\n\nA: vtd is not well documented on OS X. I did find one post on InsanelyMac (hackintosh forum) suggesting that it has to do with Intel's VT-d technology, which allows virtual machines to access hardware more efficiently.\nBy the console message, it looks like the problem is coming from a kernel extension. I would suggest running the OS X 10.8.2 combo update, which hopefully will overwrite any offending kexts with good copies. \nIf that doesn't fix it, your next best option is to file a bug report with Apple since not a lot of people share this issue. They take awhile to respond, but things will eventually be fixed.\n\nA: I propose running Force Quit Applications by pressing cmd ⌘alt ⎇esc. Then you may see which application is Not Responding, and you can kill it by pressing the Force Quit button. \nAlthough above method is my last choice when I face a hang condition, there is a another choice before it: Try to run Activity Monitor from Applications->Utilities. There you may click on the % CPU column header to see which processes are eating the CPU. Then you may select a process and press Quit Process button above the same window to kill it.\nAlthough in hang condition the second method is hard to do, in some cases could be a better choice because it shows information of all processes that may be not listed in the first method.  \n\nA: Question:  What happens if you plug it into a second monitor?  Do BOTH screens freeze?  or just the Retina display?\nQuestion #2: are your mouse clicks registering? For example, could you drag to select something, or even play music in iTunes with the mouse?  \nIF: Both screens freeze BIG issues.  Could be logic board (non video card related) HD, HD cable, Display, etc....  They would start with least invasive first.\nIF: Main screen freezes, but not secondary.  Video Card.  Try switching off the secondary video card, or the auto switching, and see if that makes a difference.\nIF: Mouse clicks are registering HD is not the problem, and neither is the Video card ( 80% sure) sounds like the cable for the display has failed, or is failing, and the display needs to be replaced.  \nSuggestion PRE solution:  Use Quicktime and do a screen recording, and then try and make your computer freeze.  If it continues to record, and you are able to move items, etc... then its a display/video card issue.  \nEither way, warranty support.  Make a backup first, then get to your local apple.  \n\nA: The first thing I usually do when I noticed an odd behaviour is repair the boot disk and  disk permissions, then reboot while holding the Shift button to get into safe mode and find out if the computer would still hang.\nIf the computer doesn't hang then at least I know none of the OS essential files is causing this.\nAfter that you can start troubleshooting the problem taking into account your last installed applications or last updated ones in the past few days.\n", "Q: Automatically change OS X desktop background for all desktops + monitors?

I have an automator script that sets a desktop to the Astronomy Pic of the Day and I noticed that it had changed the picture for a different desktop than it usually did. I just tried some of the ideas in this thread to change all the desktops and instead it changed the picture on a single desktop that wasn't even visible. If I write a script to display the current picture of each desktop it tells me that two desktops have been set to the chosen chosen image - even though neither visible desktop has changed.\nInterestingly, If I ask for the names of the desktops I get monitor names not \"Desktop 1\", \"Desktop 2\", etc...\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    repeat with aDesktop in every desktop\n        display dialog the name of aDesktop & \": \" & the picture of aDesktop as string\n    end repeat\nend tell\n\n\nA: I'm afraid this isn't a complete answer, since I haven't yet found a way to make this work with multiple desktops, but it will set the desktop of all monitors in the current space to whatever picture you specify.\non run {input, parameters}\n    set theFile to first item of input\n    tell application \"System Events\"\n        set theDesktops to a reference to every desktop\n        repeat with aDesktop in theDesktops\n            set the picture of aDesktop to theFile\n        end repeat\n    end tell\n    return theFile\nend run\n\nAdd that to a Run AppleScript action in an Automator workflow, and save it as an application.

I say this because in Lion sometimes that checkmark would not \"stick\" and default to on, and you would have to check it off at every shutdown/login, and you might have missed it.\nInvestigate this as well: Go to the \"Users and Groups\" System Preference pane. Click your account on the left (should already be highlighted and on top as current user). Make sure that under the tab \"login items\" that no Office apps reside there and are checked.\nThere are some other things to try but I believe these answers will cast light on your issue.\n\nA: ok, This is a different answer to the problem, but I am using Yosemite. This worked on OS 10.7 as well\nWhen I start the mac up, word 2011 with start with it's dialogue window. When I close this, it automatically brings up a blank document.\nNow my solution to this was so simple that doing everything that has been suggested before is a waste of time.\nNow before I get started, this is what I did to try to stop it from launching:\n1) on the word icon, right clicking it --> options --> and unchecking the \"open at login\"\nNo effect\n2) went into system preferences --> general --> unchecked the \"Reopen windows at login\"\nNo Effect\n3) Tried the Login Items in user preferences\nNo Effect\n4) Made sure the box \"Reopen window when logging back in\" was unchecked when shutting down.\nNo effect\nWhat I did was:\nWhen the dialogue window eventually showed up upon start up, there was a handy little box down the bottom that said: Don't show this when opening word\" Checked this little box and now the program opens but no blank documents or dialogue box.\nSIMPLES!\n", "Q: There is a process called SH using 100% of my CPU I checked the Activity Monitor and noticed 2 processes called sh that were eating my CPU.\nWhat apps are related to these processes and how can I stop them from eating all CPU?\n\nA: sh is a shell, a program that provides a command-line interface to your computer. It can be used either interactively, or as an interpreter for script files, such as the famous periodic maintenance scripts. Some such script is likely running in this case, and may be stuck for some reason.\nYou should be able to find out what script that is by using Inspect on the sh processes in Activity Monitor and looking at the Open Files and Ports tab. A file listed there with the .sh extension is a shell script. Its name will hopefully give you a clue as to its purpose; you can also open it as text and inspect it. \n\nA: Know it is an old post, but in my case, when I saw high cpu usage of SH, that was a VIRUS!\nI googled hours to find out this and delete.\nSolution answered here: https://superuser.com/a/868147\n", "Q: Deleting a synced photo or bookmark It appears when you sync pictures or bookmarks that it syncs in both directions, so if my iPhone (4s) has a bookmark that my PC doesn't have it will will be once synced, or if my PC has a bookmark then my iPhone will get it once synced.\nIf I want to delete a bookmark, or photo, do I need to delete it in both places so that it doesn't come back when I sync. I find it annoying that I delete it then it comes back, or that I have to look at my phone and PC when I delete things.\nHow to sync in one direction (which I've done with mapping CRM software)?\n\nA: You shouldn't need to delete a bookmark in both locations. When you delete a bookmark from one location, on the next sync it will delete it from the other location.\nThe Apple KB article here explains how you can manually manage one-way syncing for Music, Movies, TV Shows, Podcasts, Books, Audiobooks, Contacts, Calendars, Bookmarks, Notes and Photos.\n", "Q: How to install Pages, Numbers and Keynote on Snow Leopard? I just purchased a used 2006 MacBook Pro with OS X 10.6.8.\nI went to the Mac App Store and tried to load Pages, Numbers and Keynote, and it said it could not load them unless I had 10.7.  When I try to upgrade to Mountain Lion, it says my computer does not have the requirements. I can't find Lion—not sure if I could even upgrade to that?  \nMy question I guess: Is there an older version of Pages, Numbers and Keynote that I could get that would work on my machine as-is, without any upgrades?\n\nA: iWork can still be bought online. Here are search results for iWork on Amazon.\n", "Q: Automator-generated apps - Backwards compatibility In my experience apps created with automator on Mountain Lion don't work on a Snow Leopard machine. The opposite isn't true though: apps created with automator on Snow Leopard do work on a Mountain Lion machine.\nI'm creating a very simple wrapper around a command line executable and using cocoa seems overkill. I want the app to work on as many versions of OSX as possible though, so backwards compatibility is a concern.\nAny thoughts on that matter? How can I ensure that my Mountain Lion Automator app is backwards-compatible?\n\nA: I don't know how backward-compatible they are, but you can also save scripts as applications from AppleScript Editor.\nAnother option might be to use Platypus.\n\nPlatypus is a developer tool for the Mac OS X operating system. It creates native Mac OS X applications from interpreted scripts such as shell scripts or Perl, Ruby and Python programs. This is done by wrapping the script in an application bundle along with a native executable binary that runs the script.\n\n", "Q: Any easy way to search for & replace characters in JPG file names in a folder? Have a MacBook Pro 15 (Oct2009 vintage), and am running 10.8 (Mountain Lion). \nIs there an easy way to search for and replace chars in JPG file names in a folder file list?  \nI'm working with over 70,000 JPG images, and close to 1000 duplicate names must be corrected. My preferred solution is to simply change the name prefix of each from 642 to 699. None of my 3 image browsers/editing programs can do this. I've already spent more time looking for an automation solution, than changing them 1 at a time would have taken, but would prefer an automation approach if there is one. The finder search function works great, sadly there doesn't seem to be a replace function to go with it. I'm not a programmer, so am hoping there is something built that might do the job.\n\nA: Finder is not the tool for this job, but I've always done this sort of thing via Terminal. \nTo be safe, you should have a backup of your Mac since the mv command will rename everything it finds, and if more files match the \"642*\" pattern, they will get changed as well.\nHere is a snippet of code to get to the folder, find the files starting with 642 and do the edit one by one in an automated fashion. (Obviously changing the path to the real location of your images):\ncd \"/path/to/your/images\"\nfor i in 642*; do\n    mv \"$i\" \"${i/642/699}\"\ndone\n\nThis will move all images matching the wildcard 642* (meaning it starts with 642 and the rest of the name can be anything), and moves them in order to rename the 642 to 699. It will overwrite any files that already have the destination file name, so be sure that they are files you don't want.\nThis assumes that you don't organize your images into subfolders too; change 642* to */642* if this isn't the case.\n\nA: If you don't want to use the Terminal or Automator, there are commercial apps with a GUI for doing this. One is A Better Finder Rename, which has a free trial version (no need to pay if your renames are for less than 10 files).\nYou can also search the App Store for the term \"batch rename\" and see that more than 9 apps look designed to solve that problem. The three that have 10 reviews each and positive star ratings seem to be join the long time favorite leading apps at the moment:\n\n\n*\n\n*A Better Finder Rename\n\n*Rename-a-Batch\n\n*Rename It\n\n*File Rename Pro\nI would say that these three alternatives cost less but haven't been around as long as A Better Finder Rename which has worked well for me.\n", "Q: I want to change clock from 12h to 24h mode via terminal So I'm looking for the command to change from 12h to 24h. Is there even such a command? I mean I can do it with the GUI but I need to be able to do it via terminal so I can put it in a bash script.\n\nHere I want instead of the 12h format a 24h format.\n\nA: This is stored in the plist located at ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.menuextra.clock under the key DateFormat.\nHere's a quick primer:\n\n*\n\n*12 Hour Mode with AM/PM:\nEEE MMM d  h:mm:ss a\n\n\n*12 Hour Mode without AM/PM:\nEEE MMM d  h:mm:ss\n\n\n*24 Hour Mode:\nEEE MMM d  H:mm:ss\nTo apply any of these formatting strings, you can either use the defaults command at the Terminal, or if you're looking for a more programmable method, you can use the do shell script1 directive within Applescript.\nTo apply these via the Terminal, open it up and run the following command:\ndefaults write com.apple.menuextra.clock DateFormat -string 'EEE MMM d  H:mm:ss'\n\nSubstitute the string between the quotes with the version from above that you want.\nFor the changes to take immediate effect, kill -SIGHUP SystemUIServer will do the trick. Otherwise they will take effect the next time you log out and back in or restart.\n\n1 CyberCiti Primer on Shell Scripting via Applescript\n\nA: I had the problem that my date was stuck in 12h format no matter what setting I chose in System Settings. The answer above pointed me in the right direction. It looks like on macOS Ventura this has changed a bit.

Emacs is unusable as a result, and I can't interrupt processes with Ctrl-C. Interestingly, the only thing I have found control to do is that Ctrl-Z still sends SIGTSTP.\nI've swapped the Ctrl and Caps-Lock keys at the Mac level, but undoing that has no effect.

Also, you cannot replace a default Roman layout with this one. Control keys should now be functional.\n\nOption worked everywhere I tested, so non-functional could just mean that states under option don't output non-ASCII characters.

By default, it'll link to a specific dropbox folder (/Apps/Byword), but you can change this in the app's settings; just setting it to \"/\" will give access to every folder in your Dropbox.\niA Writer is another popular choice.\nIf you're looking for something more geared towards code than writing, Textastic is nice.\nAdditionally, Brett Terpstra has compiled a large list of iOS text editors and features here, though it doesn't specify which apps have full access or if they are limited to a specific App folder in Dropbox.\n\nA: I've been using 1Writer for some time now and find it to be superb. I have tried all the other popular suggestions.\nYou can navigate to any Dropbox folder, and you can specify folders to be in your quick access list. Plenty of features like Markdown support and such. Also a powerful actions functionality and customizable keyboard row. \nBut to speak to your specific need, this was something I too was looking for and found 1Writer to have the right implementation. \n\nA: Nebulous Notes is also very good at browsing all DropBox text files and folders and its interface is specifically built for this.

How on earth do you get Siri to remind you to do something when you arrive at a location in iOS 6?  It worked fine in iOS 5 but I've never got it to work on iOS 6 - it just always seems confused about what I'm trying to do. What is the correct syntax?\nSiri has been pointed at my own contact record in settings and that record contains my correct address under \"home\".\nEDIT:\nI've noticed that siri also can't answer the question \"How do I get home\". It just says \"I couldn't find an address for Nick - home\". \nOddly, if I totally delete my \"home\" address and ask \"how do I get home?\", Siri says \"I don't know what your home address is, Nick. Tap your name if you'd like to add it.\" and shows me my contact record. This is different to what it does if my home address has been set on my contact record.\nThe fact that it behaves differently if the address is keyed or not makes me think it's definitely finding my home address on my contact record, but for some reason doesn't want to use it. If I tap my address on my contact, it shows my correct location on the map so it's geocoding it correctly to coordinates, so I really don't see why this doesn't work.\nThis is what's happening: \n\n\nA: OK I've found out the answer myself.\nIt turns out that although the Maps app can geocode (find the location of) my address, Siri can't. It must be using a different geocoder to the Apple Maps app. \nAfter much faffing, I found the easiest way to fix this is to drop a marker on my house using the Apple Maps app and then add this to my own contact record as \"home\". This fixes the problem and allows Siri to know where home is. However it then means my address is incomplete if I use it for other purposes or in other apps). The only way round this seems to be add it back and tag it as \"address\" (NOT \"home\") as a second copy of the same address. Really messy.\nClearly this is a bug in Siri which will hopefully be fixed one day (I won't hold my breath). I don't recall having this problem in iOS 5, so I think this was introduced in iOS 6.\n", "Q: Reinstalling OS X 10.6 without losing any data My MacBook Pro 13' (mid 2009) won't boot.

The only difference I can tell in using it between it and a real Apple one is that in the option menu, I see two copies of \"Macintosh HD\" (both will boot it up). And, of course per this question, no Recovery HD.\n\nA: Well, I was able to \"solve\" this in a round-about way.\nI used the recovery disk assistant with my MacBook Air to make a recovery SD card. With that plugged into my mini, I was able to successfully boot into it and the disk utility there was able to comprehend my fusion drive.\nThat done, I then checked and saw that the recovery partition on the SD card was the same size as the recovery partition that wasn't working right, so I did a dd from the SD card overwriting the recovery partition.\nThe result: my option menu now offers the choice of the fusion drive (booting normally) or the recovery partition, and both work.\nWhat I think may have been going on is that core storage seems to want to turn the recovery partition into a 'boot helper' on encrypted volumes. Perhaps it was trying to do the same thing on this machine, despite the fact that there was a separate boot partition intended to serve that purpose.\nI'm not going to mark this as \"solved,\" however, because I think there has to have been a better way.\n\nA: The reason that the recovery partition doesn't work correctly, is that a Fusion logical volume group is not bootable (or at least not for the purposes of a recovery partition - a Fusion volume requires some kind of boot-loader to interpret the LVG). And if you create the fusion volume prior to installing Mountain Lion the recovery partition gets created inside the Fusion volume.\nThe way that I managed to create a DIY Fusion drive with a correctly working recovery partition is as follows.\n\n\n*\n\n*Format the SSD to a single JHFS partition.\n\n*Install Mountain Lion from your USB as normal to the SSD. (This is when the recovery partition gets correctly created on the SSD).\n\n*After installation, unplug your USB stick and boot into recovery mode (CMD + R)\n\n*Now create the LVG and Fusion volume in Terminal, but instead of choosing the entire SSD, choose only the main OS partition (in my case, this was something like disk0s2 instead of disk0). This way the bootable recovery partition you just made on the SSD remains intact.\n\n*Then install Mountain Lion from recovery (without the USB inserted - allow it download the OS again from the internet - this way the installer knows not to create a second recovery partition as the Mac must already have one to run this type of installer).\nAfter performing these steps, I've got a DIY Fusion running great and a correctly functioning recovery partition on the SSD (outside the Fusion volume).\n[N.B. I did not try installing the second time around from the USB installer. It's quite possible that the installer would correctly identify the recovery partition and not create a second one inside the Fusion volume, but I figured that using the internet installer was a sure way to make it work correctly and I can confirm that it does. If you install the second time from the USB stick and you do end up with two recovery partitions - one inside and one outside the fusion LVG - I'm sure you could fix this in a few steps by removing and resizing partitions in terminal.]\nAlso, my OPT+BOOT menu still shows two Fusion volumes and no recovery partition. But booting with CMD+R works perfectly.\n", "Q: How can I use my iPhone's contacts with the new Google Maps? The new Google Maps app seems like a good substitute for the inbuilt Maps app, as has been discussed ad nauseam. However, one drawback it exhibits over the inbuilt app is that it doesn't seem to directly integrate with your contacts - and doesn't seem to integrate with any contacts you have stored with Google Contacts/Gmail either (in my case, I sync them with my iPhone, so they are the same set). Are there any workarounds or hacks which can be used to get it do this? The best I've found so far is the obvious - to open the contacts app, copy the postcode (I am in the UK so that's typically precise enough for navigation) and paste it into Google Maps. Is there anything simpler/quicker?\n\nA: You can try this app, Contacts for Google Maps.\nIt can create links inside your Contacts that will open the address directly in the Google Maps app.\nEdit: I wrote the app.\n", "Q: Sudden flash of gray in the background In the last few days I've had a sudden flash of gray in the background. I'm on MacOS 10.7.5. I'm not able to provide a screenshot because it only happens for a split second, but here is a more or less accurate mock-up:\n\nIt happens on average 1 time per hour, though it's not regular. Sometimes 5 mins pass till the next flash of gray. It covers multi-monitors and it also happens if my external monitor is not connected.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: That is because the Dock process isn’t getting enough resources and/or is crashing.\nTheDock process is not just responsible for your Dock, but also Mission Control, Launchpad, Dashboard and the Desktop background.\nIf this happens most frequently during periods of heavy use, then it is not getting enough resources or its resources are being swapped to disk.\nIf this happens totally randomly, then there is a deeper issue. Try repairing permissions first in that case and report back if it works.\n", "Q: Is there a way to completely erase an iPod Nano 3rd generation without installing iTunes? I've had this iPod lying around for years. I'm about to sell it and I'd like to erase all the data. Is there a way to do this without installing iTunes?\nI was particularly hoping that there might be a magic combination of click wheel presses and switch toggles, or maybe a menu item I'm missing somewhere that would perform a factory reset including wiping all the data.\n\nA: The iPod nano and classic iPods get loaded a custom firmware that could be downloaded from the internet and possibly loaded with a tool other than iTunes, but on a PC you could easily use whatever disk tool you want to erase the drive by reformatting it.\nSince this would render the device unbootable, you will not want to sell it to a user that's not familiar with why it's not working, so the elegant solution would be to rent another computer with iTunes and restore it.\nApple's retail stores usually will even loan you a cable to restore your device from any of the display Macs. iTunes on a new computer would want to erase all the content anyhow - so going another step to wipe and restore the device will leave a clean slate and you might even be able to sync some demo content to the device depending on how iTunes is set up in the store you visit.\n", "Q: After installing Adobe Acrobat, can I revert to Preview for handling PDF from Firefox?

It downloaded correctly and I used it for several months with no problem.  A little over a year and a couple of iOS upgrades later, I tried to refer to the book and found it was not visible on my iBooks bookshelves, and not found in search either.\nThe book does show up in the iTunes folder on my Mac desktop machine, and it shows up in the list of books in the iPad management tab in iTunes on my desktop machine. I have iTunes configured to synchronize selected books, and the book is checked. I'm not having this problem with any other books on the iPad. \nI've noticed that the book is no longer available from the iTunes store, so I wonder if the problem is a digital rights management issue, and the iPad can no longer verify that I have a right to view the book. The iTunes store customer support service is unfortunately useless, as I can't get them to actually read my email before they respond with \"No refunds\" or \"Restore from backup\".\nAny suggestions for fixing or troubleshooting this?\n\nA: Following @bmike's suggestion in a comment I tried copying the book from iTunes on my Mac onto my iPhone. That worked. Having established that the copy of the book on my Mac worked, I unchecked the book in the book synchronization tab for my iPad in iTunes, synched, so that the book was removed from the iPad, then rechecked the box and synchronized again. The book then showed up in iBooks and I was able to access it.\n", "Q: Is there a car-friendly way to play music on the iPhone without a car kit? I'm wondering if there is a car-friendly way to play music on the iPhone without any type of car kit.  Specifically, I am looking for a way to change tracks without unlocking the phone.  I'm okay with pressing the home button, I just don't want to worry about unlocking the phone.  \nSome examples would be:\n1) Swipe controls accessible from the lockscreen.\n2) Shaking/moving the iPhone in a certain way.  \nI know Siri can do this, but I was hoping there was a way to accomplish this pre-Siri.  \nThe normal music player on the lockscreen is not suitable for driving, as I have to look at the phone to press the touchscreen in the right place.  \n\nA: You could get something like this remote, which has passthrough for any standard 3.5mm audio, and provides volume controls and a clicker remote (just like on Apple's headphones). The clicker can to play, pause, and skip (double click for forward, triple click for backward).\nThere are other similar products out there, I found a few by searching for \"iPhone inline remote\".\n", "Q: Macbook - I don't know the password or the type of macbook and don't have cd's Is there any way of booting up and erasing the user account and creating a new one. I can't login, so I don't know what version of OSX this is.\nIt's a white Macbook with a 2.16GHz processor. Model A1181\n\nA: Looks like you have a 2007 MacBook running a Core 2 Duo. If it has enough RAM installed it should run Lion, but Apple dropped official support on Mountain Lion. Unless it's been \"recently\" updated, it's probably running Snow Leopard.\nGood news is that you can reset the password... But you'll need to boot into Safe Mode and execute some Terminal commands. Terminal provides unadulterated access to the full power of OS X's Unix core. You can also do severe damage with a few misguided keystrokes.\n\n\n*\n\n*Start with the laptop powered off\n\n*Power it up, holding the Command key and the S key at the same time\n\n*The MacBook will boot, but lines of code will scroll by. When it stops adding new lines, type the following:\n\n*\n\n*/sbin/fsck -y\n\n*/sbin/mount -uaw\n\n\n*To get a list of users accounts on the laptop (based on their home directories), type:\n\n*\n\n*cd /Users/\n\n*ls\n\n\n*The folder names usually match the user accounts on the system. Assuming the account to reset is bob, type the following:\n\n*\n\n*passwd bob\n\n\n*Be sure to substitute bob with the actual username to reset.\n\n*The system will prompt you to enter a new password and then confirm it.\n\n\nYou've reset the password. Repeat steps 5-7 for any other accounts on the machine.\nTo reboot into the \"normal\" OS X type:\n   - reboot\nWhen prompted, login to that user account with the new password.\n\nA: If it has been upgraded to Lion, then it might have a recovery partition on it. Try holding down command-R while you boot it up. If you get into recovery, then you should be able to perform a wipe and reinstall.\nIf it's not running Lion, you will probably need to obtain a Snow Leopard DVD to do the same thing. Once you've installed SL, you can upgrade to Lion.\nI do not believe Mountain Lion is an option for this machine.\n", "Q: How can you see the value of a cookie on an iPhone?

Many projectors still only accept a VGA connection, especially in fixed installations. And while older Windows notebooks usually have a VGA port directly available, Macbooks always need an adapter, as far as I understand it.\nHow many different adapters are there for reasonably recent versions of Macbooks (that are likely to be still in use today)? Sometimes the owners of the Macbooks forget those adapters, and then a hectic search for other Apple users starts in the hope of finding the adapter.  \nIf I wanted to have a set of adapters in case any Macbook owner forgot theirs, how many and which ones exactly would I need?\n\nA: With the help of Mactracker, I've compiled a list of all the connectors used on Mac portables in the last decade or so.\nIf you stick with machines since 2009 (actually late 2008 discounting one iteration of the 17\" MBP), you can get away with just a mini-Displayport adapter.\nAdding to that a DVI and mini-DVI adapter will cover you every Intel (2006 and on) portable (as well as most G4 PowerBooks), except for the first MacBook Air (of which there aren't many, but it requires a micro-DVI adapter).\nMini-Displayport/Thunderbolt\n\n\n\n*\n\n*MacBook Pro 13\" and 15\": Late 2008 and on\n\n\n*\n\n*17\": Early 2009 and on\n\n\n*MacBook: Late 2009 and Mid 2010\n\n*MacBook (Aluminum): Late 2008\n\n*MacBook Air: Late 2008 and on\n\n\nDVI (full-size)\n\n\n\n*\n\n*MacBook Pro: 2006 to early 2008; late 2008 (17\" only)\n\n*PowerBook G4 (15\" and 17\"): April 2002 and on\n\n\nMini-DVI\n\n\n\n*\n\n*MacBook: early 2006 to Mid 2009\n\n*PowerBook G4 (12\"): September 2003 and on\n\n\nMicro-DVI\n\n\n\n*\n\n*MacBook Air (original, early 2008)\n\n\nMini-VGA\n\n\n\n*\n\n*iBook: May 2002 and on\n\n*PowerBook G4 (12\"): January 2003 model (PowerBook6,1)\n\n\nA: Looking at this list, I'd say that the most important adapters for you to keep around are the mini-DVI, mini-DisplayPort and the Thunderbolt ones. The other two (micro-DVI and mini-VGA) are either old and outdated or simply quite rare. So for the most part you should be safe with those initial three. If you want to be completely on the safe side though, you should look into getting those other two, older ones, as well.\n\nA: The different connections on a MacBook or MacBook Pro have almost changed with every new versions of the laptops.\nIf we go back only a couple of years MacBook Pro had built in DVI connector and there were adapters for DVI to VGA. Later on came the Mini DisplayPort and Mini-DVI.\nToday we have Apples new Thunderbolt in the laptops. Some also have HDMI.\nI suggest going to Apple Store - Cables and check out what there is still on the market.\n", "Q: How to make an iPad backup when buying a new device? I'm going to resell my iPad 3 to buy a new one.\nI need a simple way to backup everything from current iPad to be able to restore to the new one. This includes iBooks library with pdfs added from e-mails, Apps, App data, photos, etc.\nI tried doing backup from iTunes, but it does not backup everything. On iPad 20 GB is in use, but back up archive is only 6 GB.\nHow is a user expected to backup an iPad?\n\nA: There are really only two ways to back up your iPad. Both of them are comphrehensive and should transfer everything onto a new iPad. Chances are, the space difference is comprised of music, and movies, and such that you can re-download from iTunes. iCloud will handle that part automatically, and iTunes probably won't. But, it's not hard to do.\nOption 1: iCloud\niCloud is likely the easiest backup solution. Configure it in Settings > iCloud, and make sure the initial backup completes before wiping your device. This is a helpful article including information that is backed up. The only thing is there is a 5GB free storage limit. After that, you will need to purchase more storage (for a nominal fee).\nOption 2: iTunes\nThe traditional way of backing up iOS data, this way still stands strong and true. iTunes should backup all your needed data. Check out this great article about iTunes backups. I didn't find a specific mention of iBooks PDFs (which should be stored in iTunes, correct?), but it did mention on the 3rd bullet:\n\nApplication settings, preferences, and data, including documents.\n\nThis likely includes iBooks PDFs.\nSo, in summary, iCloud is likely going to be your best, easiest, and most user friendly way to backup. If it were me, I would do both. I have restored a backup from iCloud and found it remarkably easy and simple.\n\nA: While iCloud is the easiest backup solution, it looks like you're well past the free 5GB storage limit. Upgrading to 50GB is $11.88 per year.\nI suggest using iTunes for the backup. Plug the iPad into your computer and bring up iTunes. iTunes does not normally encrypt device backups, but the only way to store all your passwords in the backup is via encryption.\n\n\n*\n\n*If you haven't previously backed up your iPad with this computer, you'll want to create a new backup. \n\n\nBefore you click the backup button, be sure to click the Encrypt iPhone Backup checkbox!\n\n\n*\n\n*If you have an existing backup of the iPad in iTunes, you will need to create a new backup, but be sure to check the encrypt backup checkbox.\n\n*Backup your iPad.\n\n\nIf at all possible, get your new device (and restore it from the latest backup then check to make sure you have a good restore on the) before you say goodbye to your current one.\n", "Q: How to use new Macbook Air's power adapter with previous generation MacBook Pro? I have a MacBook Air (Late 2012), which has the new Magsafe 2 power connector.\nI would like to use the power adapter with my 15\" MacBook Pro (Mid 2010).\nIs there an adapter for it? A quick search on Google didn't yield anything.\n\nA: Apple only produces an adapter to connect the original Magsafe to Macs with Magsafe 2. It doesn't provide one to go the other way around. At the moment I'm unaware of any third party product that does this (and given the lack of third party Magsafe accessories in general, I wouldn't expect one any time soon).\n", "Q: How to fix contacts being read-only?

Is there an easy way to Convert an entire iTunes library to MP3 format then delete old version? I know you can do it manually, but then you have to go check every other song and delete it, is there a fast and easy way?\n\nA: I would select all the music you want converted, and make a playlist out of them. Next convert the files. Then select all the songs in your new playlist and delete them from your library by pressing Option Delete (OS X) or Shift Delete (Windows).\nAdditionally, I hope you aren't converting lossy music to MP3, as that would produce lesser quality files for no benefit.\n\nA: If you plan on converting your entire library, you can select all tracks and hit file then create new version then create mp3 version. Once it is done you can sort by date created then select and delete all the tracks older than the new mp3 tracks. Note that you must have date created selected from view options.\n\nA: You can set up a Smart Playlist to select all MP3 or non-MP3 audio track and use these lists to select tracks for conversion as well as deletion.\n", "Q: Disable network drive unmounting I've got a pretty specific need - to disable unmounting a network drive through the regular Finder eject function (accessed either by right-clicking the mounted drive on the desktop, or clicking the eject button in Finder). This is on OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion.\nBasically I need to stop other users of the Mac unmounting a drive volume. I'm happy if unmounting is still possible by other means (terminal etc.) My users do not purposefully eject the drive, it's usually accidental - e.g. when trying to eject a USB drive, or just a mis-click. I'd like to prevent the ejecting/unmounting entirely.\nAnyone have a way to do this? Have been searching for a while, never found a solution.\nEdit 1: I should also note this is an smb network drive, but may also need same function for an afp drive\nEdit 2 [9/1/13]: I had another idea, albeit problematic. With defaults write com.apple.finder ProhibitEject true I can disable ejecting any volume completely. Unfortunately this won't do in my circumstance, I need users to be able to plug in portable USB drives.\n\nA: You could open a terminal window and change to the network path so that the file system is marked as in use. You could also open a file or application on the drive. \nThe users might still choose to force eject, so it's not a proper ban on ejecting the volume, but it adds another roadblock. \n\nA: You can mount share via command line using mount_smbfs(8):\n# mount -t smbfs //user@server/sharename /path/to/share/directory\n\nThis directory can't be unmounted from Finder directly and user have to unmount it explicitly:\n# umount /path/to/share/directory\n\n", "Q: Can I use Google's new CardDAV-based contacts sync to sync between my Exchange contacts and Google contacts on my iPhone? I want my Google contacts and my Exchange contacts to sync through my iPhone as follows:\nGoogle contacts <--> iPhone <--> Exchange contacts\nand I was looking at Google's CardDAV sync as a way to do it. http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2012/09/a-new-way-to-sync-google-contacts.html?m=1\nFirst, is this even possible?\nWhat I can't understand is that after you add the CardDAV account to the iPhone your new contacts must go in that specific contacts group in order to sync. But of course they won't sync to Exchange since the Exchange contacts by definition are in their own group. \nCan I do this?\n\nA: I haven't had an opportunity to test this out, but I'm pretty sure that the iPhone silos contacts on a per-account basis. When you set up a CardDAV or Exchange account in Settings, it's unique from anything else. The contacts don't intermingle, beyond showing up in the same app.\nYou can think of it like having two different email accounts that your phone checks. You can access both, they'll even show up in a unified inbox, but emails in a folder on one account don't get synced to a folder on the other account.\nOff the top of my head, to synchronize the two accounts, you'd probably need an app running on a computer that could synchronize between the two, and then connect your phone to either the CardDAV or Exchange server as the canonical version.\n", "Q: Muting Messages Audio Alerts I'm looking for a non-tedious way to make the Messages application in Mountain Lion silent without killing the audio output of other applications. Any ideas? Is this a job for AppleScript or defaults?\n\nA: You can change this setting in the Messages app preferences.\nGo to Messages-> Preferences -> Alerts. Select 'Message Received' in the Event menu and uncheck the 'Play a sound' box.\nYou may also have to do this for the 'Message Received in Active Chat' and 'Message Received in Chat Room' events, as well as any others that are triggering unwanted sounds.\n\n\nA: Slide the \"speech volume\" slider all the way to the left.\n", "Q: vba split() not working in Mac Word 2004 I was trying to run a Word macro on a Mac.

I've got a tool to normalize WAV audio files, but it only works by dragging and dropping the file either onto the GUI or onto its dock's icon.\nAs far as I know the app doesn't have any option to pass from command line, so I was wondering whether there is a way to pass the file from a terminal in order to use it in a bash script.\n\nA: Generally this is equivalent to dragging a file onto an app's icon:\nopen -a Your_WAV_Tool.app /path_to/your_file.wav\n\nYou can use the complete path to your app if it isn't in an expected place.\n\nA: I can't answer for certain, but it sounds like a no. Unless the app reads command line arguments, you can't pass it the file. And I don't think you can't trigger GUI events without a GUI.\nThe best solution I can think of is using something like Automator to try and simulate the drag and drop. But a quick look through Automator doesn't seem to show anything event simulation.\nSo the last option is writing your own program to literally drag and drop a file. You can then write a command line interface for your program. This can be achieved with Java's Robot class.\n", "Q: VPN and insecure WiFi on iPad I have a question about VPN Access on my iPad. After every time I lock it for more than 15 minutes, when I return to using my iPad, it reconnects to WiFi but doesn't re-establish the VPN connection automatically - I have to do it manually. This means my iPad is connected to insecure WiFi, so it's possible that some application can send secure data in background over the insecure connection.\nHow can I avoid my data being sent over an insecure connection?\n\nA: I'm not aware of a jailbreak that forces only a VPN and the core OS has no provision to only route traffic through a VPN.\nThe OS needs to contact an insecure network and send traffic in order to establish a VPN connection. For the time the device is connected to the network and not having built a secure tunnel - you are vulnerable to network sniffing. Even once you have a VPN - the traffic can still be sniffed and recorded for later analysis, but the encryption/obfuscation makes it harder to tell what data is being transmitted and to what servers you are communicating since all traffic goes to the VPN server.\nIn short, you need to be vigilant to ensure the VPN reconnects. If you make sure that your iOS device does not auto-join these untrusted WiFi hotspots, you will have to manually re-join if it drops so that you can manually fire up the VPN again and the device will not inadvertently re-join and put your traffic and data at risk.\n", "Q: Bidirectional sync between Outlook and iPhone? I use an iPhone 4S with iTunes 11 on Windows 7. I still haven't found a way to change the syncing direction with Outlook: The first time I used sync, I checked the option \"Sync from Outlook to iPhone\" (contacts, calendar), and now I'd like to sync both ways. But it seems to be impossible!\n\nA: iOS is designed to sync media with iTunes while syncing mail and other information through online servers. Based on what I know, syncing your iPhone with Outlook means that iTunes reads your email account information (server names, login credentials, etc.) from Outlook, and configures your iPhone to access the same email accounts.\nFrom this point, you can keep Outlook and iPhone \"synchronized\" by allowing them to continue accessing the same centralized email account(s). The email server behaves as the master copy, and both clients access it and retrieve the data.\nYou may need to configure your email server to allow IMAP or Exchange access in order to see the behavior you want. This will depend on your email provider.\n", "Q: What can I do with an iPad Bluetooth-paired to a Mac? I have successfully paired my iPad Gen 3 to my Mid-2012 MacBook Air. What can I do with this connection?\n\nA: I recently gave a presentation using Keynote on my MacBook and keynote remote on my ipad. This is a really cool solution that allows you to control slide movement on the MacBook while seeing both slides and presenter notes on the ipad.\n\nA: Not a whole heck of a lot, as it turns out, but which stems from the difference between iOS and OS X ... which it seems ought to talk to each other directly, but no. Not in the cards.\nSee this post: What is the use of the bluetooth on iPad?\n\nA: If you have an iPad with a cellular data connection, you can use Bluetooth for tethering. It's likely more battery-friendly than using Wi-Fi.\n", "Q: Can I use a iMac Late 2009 or Mid 2010 as a screen for regular PC Im thinking about building a custom hackintosh. I currently own a late 2009 iMac, the one which theoretically support video input from mini displayport.\nThe video card I am planning to buy has a displayport output, but not mini displayport. I am wondering if it is possible to use the iMac as a display when connecting the hackintosh to it using a displayport to mini displayport cable (if that even exists). \nHas anyone ever tried something like that?\n\nA: Yes an iMac will work as a screen for a regular PC, but only with 27\" models of Late 2009, 2010 iMacs. If those conditions are met then the iMac supports what is called Target Display Mode, aka using your iMac as a display.\nAlso you will need a Display port to mini display port cable, they do exist as sold on Monoprice and at other fine online retail locations.\nFor more information on using your iMac in Target Display mode see Using a 27-inch iMac (Late 2009 or Mid 2010) as an external display\n\nTo use an iMac (27-inch, Mid 2010) or iMac (27-inch, Late 2009) in Target Display mode with another computer as the source:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Make sure both computers are turned on and awake.  \n  \n*Connect a male-to-male Mini DisplayPort cable to the Mini DisplayPort on each computer. The 27-inch iMac will enter Target Display mode and display content from the source computer.\n  Note: If you are connecting two 27-inch iMacs, connect a Mini DisplayPort cable to each computer and press Command + F2 on the 27-inch iMac keyboard that you will use as an external display. \n  \n*To leave Target Display mode, press Command + F2 on the keyboard of the 27-inch iMac that is in Target Display mode. To return to Target Display mode, press Command + F2 again.\n\n", "Q: Possible to integrate Keynote in custom UI? In Windows it is possible to load and instantiate COM/ActiveX components, e.g. PowerPoint, and use them to render in your UI of choice.\nWith e.g. WebKit, this seems to be possible as WebKit is accessible through /System/Library/Frameworks/WebKit.framework.\nIs it possible to do something equivalent in OS X with Keynote?\n\nA: Yes, on OS X - the technology used to make most programs is Objective C where messages get passed from the UI to the logic and a model-view-controller idiom is used.\nIf you are skilled, you can do things like patch the binary to swizzle a method or use SIMBL to modify apps that do not have a plug in system like Keynote.\nThese reverse-engineering feats require some very detailed skill and can break each time the app is updated, so something that is theoretically possible becomes unlikely to happen as something you can download for free with the work already being done for you.\nYour commend about the quicklook ability to preview keynotes is where I would start if you wanted to develop a true application to read keynote files. From there, you would need to reverse engineer the storage format by discovering that a .key file is really just a fancy zip file and go from there. \n\nA: Don't forget that a Keynote can be exported to the QuickTime .mov format. This preserves transitions and builds, and even click-to-advance. I'm certain this could be embedded into a custom UI.\n\nA: As you said, Quick Look is the way to go. But the support for eg. advanced animations isn't perfect I think. You could also try to export your .key to HTML if you have direct access, and via injected js take the control over the playback (The html is actually images that are animated through js/css).

I have a lightly hot-rodded, early 2008 MacPro 3,1. Boots from an SSD mounted in the lower optical bay and attached to the second optical SATA port. Each of the four internal drive bays hosts a 3TB drive which I have configured as a striped and mirrored ZFS partition. Unfortunately, all my 2012 drives are running at 2008 speeds and are limited to 3 GB/s.\nLooking for insight from anyone who has replaced the stock hard drive subsystem to 6GB/s speeds via a 4 or 8 channel PCIe SAS/SATA card with an internal SAS connector and connecting it to the built-in SATA backplane with an \"extension\" cable.\nMy workflow is predominantly InDesign, Illustrator and Photoshop with light video editing occasionally tossed into the mix. My typical \"large\" Photoshop files range from 200MB to 600MB. Most InDesign files are 100 to 200 pages in length with transparency, layers and multiple elements on each page.\nI'm not looking for ideas surrounding Apple's RAID card that sits in the topmost slot. I'd rather use the stock backplane since I can plug directly into it.\nFor anyone posting, I'd appreciate suggestions on a SAS card for the upgrade. It needs a minimum of a single internal mini-SAS port, but dual internal ports would be welcomed (for attaching the boot SSD). Since I'm running ZFS I dont need hardware RAID support. Just need to talk to the bare drives. Lack of boot ability means I only run the backplane and keep the SSD on the motherboard. \nWhile increasing speed is my main intent, I don't want to sacrifice system stability or data integrity.\n\nA: For changing the back plane you might look at the Pro Cable 1 with a review here.\nThere is also the DX 4 if you want to really stuff you Mac Pro with drives.\nI don't have direct experience with a controller but was leaning toward a MAXPower RAID mini-SAS 6G-1e1i since it has both internal & external SAS ports.  Note that this card will not boot the Mac Pro.\nThe real problem is that I would want both a RAID card and a Mercury Accelsior and the Mac Pro (2008) only has 1 free x16 PCI 2.0 slot and you would need 2.\nThere is also a rumor of a Mercury Accelsior with eSATA ports in the near future.\n", "Q: How do I uninstall old SDKs?

I have also installed Xcode 4.5.2 but it seems that it does not come with the command line tool called uninstall-devtools. \nHow can I get rid of the old SDKs?\n\nA: The installer for Xcode 4.3 had an option for removing older versions of Xcode which removed /Developer/.\nYou can probably just delete the folder completely. It was possible to delete single developer folders even before Xcode 4.3. From an answer by Chris Espinosa on Stack Overflow:\n\nIf you have multiple Developer folders, you can drag any of them to the trash without damaging the others.

Explorer on Windows is much faster when it comes to network interaction. \nWhat can I do? Change the protocol? It must be AFP, so do I have to change the protocol elsewhere in the kernel? \n\nA: My advice would be to use NFS. You should also try to manually mount the partition from the terminal, so you can add some options too, like\n  -nolock,locallocks,rdirplus\n\nThis made my browsing much faster, even over wifi. \nCheers\n", "Q: Is there a way to dedicate the discrete graphic card to CUDA on a MacBook Pro? When a display is attached to a CUDA capable graphic card, a run time limit is enforced on CUDA kernels run on the card.\nIs it possible to use the integrated graphic card to power the display and, at the same time, exploit the discrete one to run long running CUDA kernels?\nI tried gfxCardStatus, but if I force the use of the integrated card, the discrete one is disabled completely and isn't recognized anymore by the CUDA driver.\n\nA: The solution for that kind of problem is to shut down the graphical windows management and to use Mac OS from a TTY. This is cumbersome, but not as much as to dual-boot your machine and to switch from one OS to the other.\nThe way to do that is to go into Settings->Users and to set the login options to \"username and passwords\" (default is user list). \nThen log out all users and go to log screen\nIn the login testbox, fill in >console\nand type your password in the password box (you must have admin rights, but I assume this is already the case)\nHere you go, you're in text mode and the GPU is fully available for CUDA.

Unfortunately, the display isn't working. I have read that it will work on a \"hackintosh\" so I would assume it's a driver issue and not a motherboard issue. \nHas anyone had experience in this or does anyone know where I could find some Cinema Display drivers for Windows 7 or 8? I do have access to a MacBook Pro so could I someone get the windows drivers from the Boot Camp assistant? \n\nA: I have that exact same motherboard I purchased less than a month ago. With default BIOS settings, you're right it doesn't work, but I got the 27\" display to work fine without installing bootcamp drivers.\nMake sure you've updated all your drivers and BIOS, especially Intel Graphics 4000 and install Virtu MVP in order to use a discrete graphics card with the thunderbolt interface for gaming/performance. Make the following adjustments to your BIOS (hold delete on boot to access BIOS settings.) Obviously, you might have to plug in a non-thunderbolt display to be able to change the settings.\n\n\n*\n\n*Internal Graphics: Enabled\n\n*Init Display First: IGFX or PEG (not PCI)\n\n\nI believe there's also a setting for Thunderbolt Bandwidth which I changed to 40, but I'm not certain if that's necessary to change to get it to work. \n\nA: The Apple 27\" LED cinema display should work on Windows without drivers, as noted on Anandtech.\n\nThe good news is that the display works under Windows 7, the bad news is you need Boot Camp installed to get brightness control. The downloadable Windows drivers won’t work on a system without Boot Camp installed, in other words, on a normal PC you lose the ability to control brightness.\n\nAdditionally from a technical perspective thunderbolt to mini display port should be technically compatible, as noted on What is the differnce between the Apple LED Cinema Display (27\" flat panel) and the Apple Thunderbolt Display (27-inch)?\n\n27 Cinema Display mini display port will work with older Macs with mini display port only output. They will also work with thunderbolt Macs (as the last device in chain). \n\nI would suggest that there is a setting and or graphics output configuration issue occurring on the GA-Z77X-UP4 TH, I would double check the firmware settings and make sure that on board graphics is enabled and set to work over the Thunderbolt ports. \n", "Q: Where is Address Book in Mountain Lion?

And she can be sure a photo isn't duplicated anywhere.\nCan I make iPhoto work like this? (besides copying photos and then deleting from the original album)\n\nA: No - iPhoto is a database and it handles all storage of original photos as well as the edited version of the photo. Albums are pointers to photos that exist in events. You can think of events as somewhat inflexible folders since there is a one to one correspondence between photos and events, but not photos and albums.\nYou might have a look at PhotoMechanic which stores all photos in the filesystem and you can leverage familiarity with that idiom to not be surprised by a photo appearing in an album but be stored elsewhere.\nSince iPhoto doesn't really duplicate photos when you place a photo in one album or another, it's not clear if there is a worry about duplicates or a an actual workflow issue that will systematically create duplicates of your photos.\nYou will have to make a call on how much time to spend learning a new program versus becoming comfortable with how iPhoto works - but most people can quickly learn to avoid actions that preclude having iPhoto duplicate photos without you being aware of the duplication.\n", "Q: OS X Server: Multiple Mobile Homes syncing to a single Network Home Directory? Looking for validation that Profile Manager in Mountain Lion Server can be used to keep Portable (Mobile) Home Directories on multiple Macs in sync with one Network Home.\nUsers have \"main\" desktop iMacs and \"secondary\" MacBooks. We would like to keep their ~/Documents and ~/Library in sync on both machines. (Also need to sync /usr/local/, ~/.bashrc, ~/.rvmrc, etc. etc.)\nWondering, among other things, what happens when both machines are on and try to sync at same time?\nAnyone tried this? Success? Pitfalls? Alternatives? Thoughts?\n\nA: This is still a supported function.\nIt's something that needs care and tending (like any sync solution) when a burp causes problems, but Mountain Lion server hasn't made it better or worse than recent server versions (Lion, Snow Leopard) in the management and deployment of network home folders that sync.\nIf you allow multiple log in or true mobile syncing where a copy of the home folder gets literally copied to each Mac - then you will get a sync conflict dialog should there be three edits to the same file and the system can not systematically resolve the conflict.\nIn practice, the pre-deployed filters work well so that users become accustomed to not opening the same app on multiple computers once they start seeing merge dialogs. You can also modify the sync rules if you have particular problems with a specific software package/file or user.\n", "Q: Change primary display through command line Is it possible to change the primary screen for a Mac through command line? \nThe traditional way of doing this is from System Preferences > Displays and dragging the white menu bar on the top, between screens.\nI have different setups at home and work and sometimes I need the primary display to be different. Rather than having to change this by dragging/dropping as explained above, I would like to run a script through a program like Alfred/QuickSilver and then just toggle/switch my primary displays.\nIf i could do this through command line, it would be awesome. There is this program called cscreen that allows me to do this, but it only runs on PowerMacs.\n\nA: cscreen actually runs on Intel-based Mac as well. You should be able to change primary display through it. \n", "Q: Can I use my girlfriends phone number on my iPad My girlfriend and I both have iPhones and we both want to use my apple id but have separate numbers. I just bought her an iPad and it only has my phone number under iMessage. Can I add hers to my apple id or the iPad?\n\nA: Not really except for one special case..\nOne Apple ID can have two phone numbers, but one phone number cannot be linked with two Apple ID.\nIf she didn't care to have iMessage work at all, you could sign in to her iPhone with your Apple ID and messages to both numbers would then come to your Apple ID until she decided to start using her number with another Apple ID.\n", "Q: Why is the system dictionary not available from .pdf files containing text within Safari? How can one use system dictionary ^+⌘+D in .pdf's opened in Safari 6 (using Acrobat Reader)? Is perhaps Adobe Reader at fault (i.e. does the dictionary work with Safari's default .pdf reader)?\n\nA: The program that draws the text needs to use one of Apple's standard SDK for drawing text for the shortcut dictionary to work. Since safari is handing the PDF over to Adobe to render - they apparently are not using a standard text field but have implemented their own code/class to do the drawing.\nThis is very common for web browsers like Chrome and other programs that desire to avoid being a Mac program and instead be more cross platform.\nIn your case, simply ditching the Acrobat plug in will restore the PDF handling using the native tools and your dictionary shortcuts will work again. \nSimply delete the AdobePDFViewer.plugin from /Library/Internet Plug-ins.\n\nA: In my testing, the ⌃⌘D shortcut doesn't work in Preview or PDFs within Safari. However selecting the word, and using the Look Up in Dictionary item from the context (right-click) menu does work as expected (it displays the yellow highlighting and popup, not the full Dictionary app).\nI'm not sure why the shortcut doesn't work, but it's a decent work around at least.\n", "Q: Mouse not reacting to hover when bamboo tablet unplugged I have a mid-2010 15\" Macbook Pro with 10.8 installed, and I use a Wacom Bamboo tablet (one of the older ones, it's model MTE-450). I've noticed that whenever the tablet is plugged in, many hover states for the mouse no longer work for the trackpad and generic plug-in mice.\nFor example, normally if you hover over the three buttons at the top left of a window, they'll show a \"x – o\" pattern. However, if my tablet is plugged in, and I move the mouse over to hover, no hover occurs. This is the same with the dock icons, and with close-tab on Safari. Unplugging the tablet does nothing, and so far only a restart will fix this.\nAny tips on how to start fixing?\n\nA: Have you installed the latest 10.8 compatible driver for the Bamboo?\nYou can find it here: http://cdn.wacom.com/U/Drivers/Mac/Consumer/530/PenTablet_5.3.0-3.dmg\n", "Q: How to see how much music do I have in iTunes? The new iTunes version has brought some changes. And I just realized that it won't show anymore how much music do I have.\nIt used to say the size and the total play time at the bottom of the window, but it's gone now. Can I ripristinate the indicator? Or what's the easiest way to check my music library size?\n\nA: You can bring back those details at the bottom of the screen by clicking Show Status Bar in the View menu, or pressing ⌘/.\n\nA: Go to Settings, then General, then About and it should list how many songs, videos, photos etc. that you have.\n", "Q: How to make Spotlight index PDF documents to search faster or on my command? I need to search some words in many PDF documents. It worked very well when I searched over old documents but my OS X has not indexed yet the new PDFs. How can I search over the new PDFs?\n\nA: Spotlight indexes are updated when a file is written, so results should be available within milliseconds of the write operation being finished.\nDelays in finding a search result are due to a slow or problematic index or a failure of the scanner to complete that file.\nYou'll need to diagnose spotlight or perhaps just rebuild your index around the folder if you have problems with the subsystem. It's hard to know what of the three causes is happening without someone who knows how things work poking at the system.\n\nA: As an alternative to Spotlight, you can index your PDFs in apps like DevonThink, iDocument or FingerPDF to search faster in your collection of PDFs.\n", "Q: Activate unsubsidized iPhone 5 - can I later switch carriers? I'm living in Germany and recieved an unused iPhone 5 A1429 without SIM or contract as a gift. I'm planning to use it abroad, likely with prepaid SIM cards.\nThe phone is not activated yet and I am very much afraid of it being locked to the first network or SIM card brand I stick in. Is that what happens during activation? What's the purpuse of activation?\nUnfortunately I could not find any useful information from Apple, other than I have to have a SIM card inserted to activate the unit - WiFi won't do.\n\nA: An authorized unlocked iPhone does not need a SIM card to activate the OS after a restore and it will work once you run through Apple's software setup screens when it asks things like if you want to set up iCloud or location services... Activation is just the process of checking whether the device should be carrier locked by querying a server of Apple's choice over WiFi and then updating the appropriate carrier settings if the ones loaded from the factory are out of date for a particular SIM or region.\nEven in the US - iPhone 5 that are sold \"under contract\" to Verizon are not actually SIM locked and you can use them with any compatible nano SIM that supports at least one frequency and protocol that the phone model supports. It also is a A1429 model.\nYou can remove any SIM and power it on if you are worried about some carrier settings being locked.\n\nA: I bought my unlocked iPhone 5 Model A1429 at Apple Store Hong Kong, had an Apple Genius activated it using a Hong Kong GSM SIM card, and now am happily roaming with other GSM SIM card in other countries. Not a problem.\n", "Q: MacBook Air wifi issues I bought a brand new MacBook Air from the apple store in Sydney last week, but no matter where I go to connect to a wifi source, it never connects. Wherever I try an exclamation mark shows up and I don't know why this is. I've tried a few things in the system preferences but still unsure. Can someone please help me??\n\nA: I wrote an extensive post on MacBook Air wifi issues:\nhttps://apple.stackexchange.com/a/70605/34078\nIt's not exactly your symptoms, but a good start. \nTake a look at the wifi equipment you are trying to attach to. If you can't still get a connection after reading my previous post, take the MBA back to the Apple store and see if you can connect there. If you connect, the issue probably sits with your wifi router. If you cannot connect, it's the laptop.\n", "Q: Detecting that a script is run within ARD Does anyone know of a way to detect that a shell script is running within ARD (vs. running the same script locally on the machine)?\nI looked at detecting that we are running in interactive mode - that fails, since both are noninteractive.\nI'm looking at the $0 variable, which looks more promising - it returns -bash when run from the command line, returns the name of the script when running within a script run locally, and returns /bin/bash when run via ARD. However - I'm not certain whether those effects can be counted on.\nDoes anyone have any input on this?\n\nA: Why not pass in an extraneous argument when you issue a command from ARD. \nIt's more a workflow than a system generated tag, but ARD likely sends the same command to launchd as the open -a command would so that level of indirection means that you can't depend on the typical ppid from ps -ef to find the process that forked a specific script.\nWhy not push a wrapper script to all your machines and use that wrapper script to log the arguments to console? Then ARD can call the wrapper script.\nSomething like a script stored in /usr/local/bin/remote would work well:\n#!/bin/bash\necho \"This script was called remotely and is about to run another script.\"\n/bin/bash $*\necho \"This script has just run another script.\"\n\nYou can get all fancy with parsing the arguments or using logger and/or date/time stamping or recording which computer did the sending, but this is a common way to track execution of other scripts.\n", "Q: Where on the logic board is the flash memory that comprises the OS on the iPhone 3GS? Staring at the guts of my dated phone, I was curious how feasibly I might remove the logic board, swap it with another, and resume normal operations.\nAs such, I've been hunting for pics detailed iPhone innards but I've found nothing more than an obscure forum post or the iFixit teardown.\nIs swapping logic boards possible? Will it impact the entire phone? \n\nA: All of your data is stored on the flash memory, which is one of the chips soldered on to the logic board. It's not really possible to swap the memory to a different board (perhaps if you had advanced electronics skills, but I wouldn't like the chances of success).\nIf there's a problem with your logic board, you can replace it with a new one, as detailed in that iFixit link. Assuming everything goes to plan, and you have no other issues with the phone, it will effectively be a new iPhone. If you have a backup of your old one, you should be able to restore your data during the set up process.\n", "Q: How to create a terminal use only account in MacOSX? I want to create a user(say, hera) that can only be used in terminal. That is this user does not appear in the Mac welcome screen. This user can be su - hera by other users.\nCan I do this and how?\n\nA: I echo the comments above. I'm not sure why you would want to bother hiding the user, why not just have a single admin account, making everyone else \"standard\" accounts and use sudo in the CLI (Command Line Interface - \"Terminal.app\") if you need to.\nAnyway, here is the Apple tech article on creating hidden users and/or just hiding users from the login window:\n\nSet the Login window to display name and password fields\nIn the Users & Groups preferences pane (Accounts pane in Mac OS X v10.6 and earlier), click Login Options, then select \"Display login window as: Name and password\".\nWith this enabled, no user accounts are listed in the Login window.\nIf changing the Login Window to only display the name and password fields does not meet your needs, then you can use the following steps in this article to hide a user account.\nAdd users to the HiddenUsersList (advanced)\nWith Mac OS X v10.4 and later you can hide users from the Login window by adding them to the HiddenUsersList array in the /Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow.plist file. The following command will hide the users \"mei\" and \"anne\" from the Login window:\nsudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow HiddenUsersList -array-add mei anne\n\nNote: These users will still appear in the Accounts (Mac OS X v10.6 and earlier) or Users & Groups (OS X Lion) pane in System Preferences.\n\nSource: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5017\n", "Q: Can a Mac boot when the right shift key is broken in the pressed position? Here's the thing, the right shift key of my macbook is stuck, so it always boots in safe mode once I turn the machine on. Worse, I cannot log in since my password has lower case letters. \nI tried resetting the NVRAM by holding Command - Option - P - R and also went into the disk utilities, however nothing I can do there helps.\nI looking for a way to disable the right side shift key or alternatively enable the bluetooth via command line, since I have a wireless keyboard, but I cannot make either work.\nUPDATE:\nI woke up today and the key was working fine. However I do not trust on it. Probably when the MacBook gets warmer it will stuck again.\nI downloaded a software called KeyRemap4MacBook, which can be downloaded from here. I followed this tutorial in order to deactive the key, this is a temporal fix while I make some saving to buy a new one.\n\nA: Sadly, you might need to open the Mac and disconnect the keyboard.\nHere is an image from iFixit.com's takeapart for the 15 inch model.\n\nIt is protected by a metal cage - but you won't need to do all the steps - just get the bottom off and disconnect the battery before working on the keyboard cable.\nYou will of course need a USB keyboard to work things temporarily and enable the bluetooth keyboard if you can't get there with a mouse or the trackpad only. Do read the cautions on the repair guide and be sure you are up to a delicate task. A proper Mac technician might charge $30 for this repair since it's quite easy for someone with all the tools and experience getting in to the Mac.\n\nA: You can't use any third-party software for this, as it won't load until after the system boots. Your only hope is to repair or disable the keyboard.\n", "Q: How to fix dark screen after locking iphone 4 ios6? The last week or two my iphone 4 started dimming it's screen to almost black whenever I lock it. Then when I unlock it I have to get to the brightness slider and move the slider to restore light to the screen.\nCan anyone explain why this is happening and how to fix it?\n\nA: The algorithm for auto-brightness was adjusted significantly in iOS 6.\nRather than before where you would see an immediate change on turning on auto-adjust, now it's a more gradual process, and you can actually see the slider moving as it makes updates.\nAlso, another change is that the auto-adjust now works on the lock screen, so at night you won't be blinded, and in the day you can actually see the screen in day light.\nPersonally, I found it very annoying for about 2 weeks, and now I've adjusted to it, I find it works much better than before. If I want to manually control the screen, pointing it at a bright light causes it to brighten significantly, etc.\nFinally, some sites have suggested that you can \"tune\" or reset it by turning auto-adjust off, setting the brightness to minimum, then turning auto back on.\nWorth noting, that as I'd had to get my flashlight replaced right when iOS 6 came out, I actually assumed it had broken the ambient light sensor and I took the phone to the apple store because the auto-adjust switch didn't work as it had previously. The geniuses had no explanation for the new behaviour. I had to google it myself, and plenty of other people have complained about it.\n\nA: I've had that issue before, and it indeed seems to be a bug of sorts. As evidenced by the fact that one shouldn't have to hold their phone up to direct light, or manually adjust brightness on a frequent basis.\nI would recommend starting with a phone reboot - hold down the power and home button until you see the Apple logo. This may help the situation\nNext, you could also try turning off \"Automatic Brightness\". Open the Settings app, tap \"Brightness & Wallpaper\", then switch \"Auto-Brightness\" off.\n", "Q: What could cause contact syncing errors on iPhone? I deleted a contact about two years ago and it now appears under another person's contact. I have deleted all numbers for the contact I no longer need, but when I sync to computer Gmail the number appears with a different name on the number. \nFor example:\n\"Brad's\" number is (743) 222-2222 but I deleted this contact out of my iPhone. However it now appears under \"Ted's\" name.\nSo now \"Ted's\" number is listed as (743) 222-2222, and Ted's real number is gone - \"Brad's\" number (which was deleted) actually replaced \"Ted's\" real number?\nAny ideas of why this would happen? It has done it with three other contacts as well.  \n\nA: From your question, I think your setup involves syncing contacts with Google, a computer (Mac?), and an iPhone. Syncing with Google has been a pile of poo since Mountain Lion. For me, it kept duplicating contacts, bringing back deleted ones, and as you mentioned, swapping the contact information between contacts. \nSince neither Apple nor Google seem to care about fixing it, my solution is to use iCloud to sync contacts between the Mac and iPhone. (This seems to be Apple's preferred method, so it's the one in which bugs will likely be fixed the fastest.) I periodically upload a vCard of my contacts to Google. This is a lot less work than hunting down all the contacts that syncing with Google messes up.\n\nA: It looks like the problem comes from the state of your contacts in Gmail. You must log in to your Gmail account and navigate to the Contacts section. Next see what exactly appears under \"Brad\" and under \"Ted\" entries.\n", "Q: Removing the automatic connection for 802.1X via terminal So in the spirit of this question I was wondering if it is possible to disable automatic 802.1X connection via terminal as well.\nAm I right to assume that this is a computer setting (meaning that if I run this script with no user logged in it still disables it for all existing and future users)?\n\nA: It took me some hours to learn that it's a boolean value (and not just 0 or 1 as 'defaults' would report) but finally i came up with the following LoginHook which does the trick. As LoginHooks get\nexecuted as root user, you have to 'su' to the user currently being logged\nin before running the script below. As Michele points out below, that username\nis available as $1 to the Hook-Script running as root.\nIt seems to be a user byHost-Setting, although SystemPrefs would ask for a admin password to tweak this setting...\nMy hook script being executed in user-context looks like this:\n#!/bin/sh\n\nif [ `whoami` = \"root\" ]; then\n  echo \"$0: Must run as regular user, not root!

Hope it helps.\n\nA: This is what we implemented at work.  It runs as a login script for each user that logs into the computer.  Since OS X 10.9, the location has changed and the file name is different for each user.  The script looks for the unique file for that user and changes the auto connect value.\n\n#!/bin/bash\n\n### Variables\nuser=`/usr/bin/logname`\nx=$(find ~/Library/Preferences/ByHost -name \"com.apple.network.eapolcontrol*.plist\")\n\n### Functions\n\ndefaults write $x EthernetAutoConnect -bool false\n\n\nA: Just disable the Enable automatic connection tickbox in the 802.1x tab of your advanced interface option as it is the equivalent of the terminal command.\n\nA: I don't know how this solution can work, since a LoginHook is executed as root and not as the user itself.\nHere my solution:\n#! /bin/sh\nsu - $1 -c \"defaults -currentHost write com.apple.network.eapolcontrol EthernetAutoConnect -bool false\";\n\nNote that the option -currentHost will do the stuff with the host uuid ;-)\nCheers,\nMichele\n", "Q: Is there a maximum number of AirPlay receivers that I can output to at the same time? If I buy 6 different Airport Express' to have one in each room will they all work together or is there a maximum number of receivers you can use at once? For example if I want to choose between the six rooms or play the music in all the rooms at once will that work?\n\nA: The maximum number of Airplay receivers are 3 to 6 as noted in iTunes: About playing music with AirPlay\n\nThe maximum number of outputs are three to six in typical conditions. The number that works for you will depend on your environmental conditions (such as building composition and local radio interference), distance to the outputs, and available network capacity relative to your other usage.\n\n\nA: In answer to your points here is what I have found when installing my system:\n14 zone system (14 apple TVs; 14 Airplay receiver amps; Quad-core 8 GB RAM Dell PowerEdge Rack mount server (4 TeraBytes); 1 Mac server with homeshare; 1GB 24 port switch; 1GB 4 port router; 2 x 1GB wireless access points).\nSo far I have had no issues with the receiver limit (6 zones set up so far). Make sure your Apple TV's are directly linked to your switch using CAT6 so that they do not take up wireless Bandwidth. Use the wireless for your IOS devices.\nA point to note is that even though you may be running a 1GB network, the Apple TVs and your Airplay amplifiers are 10/100. \nThe homeshare 5 machine limit is a non-issue as the Airplay receivers are IOS devices. Homeshare applies to mac devices and is only an Apple method of serving out the media you have stored on Itunes on different machines. 5 machines is more than adequate (or simply consolidate it on a single server using Air Video and Handbrake (make sure the copyright laws in your country allow you to do so :-) ). I have both mac homeshare server and my main Dell server is running the Air Video Server with Air Video clients on my Ipads and Iphones.\nThere is no need for commercial solutions which cost a fortune (NOT that this is working out cheap...it is all relative).\nThis solution is costing no-more than a Sonos Home system, which only lets you stream audio to different rooms. The difference is that with Sonos you can control each room from the same controller, with this system you need one IOS devices for every room you want to play different media in. NOT a big deal as the up side is that you can also stream video and also mirror your IOS device screen i.e play satellite TV e.g Skygo or Skype to your TV screen and also view all your photo albums.\nGood Luck!\nHarp Grewal\n\nA: I currently have 5 units working on airplay. There is no delay on sound between rooms. I have:\n\n\n*\n\n*3 older airport Express\n\n*1 new 2nd Gen\n\n*1 apple TV\n\n\nThe only thing I had to do was upgrade the Network card in the PC to 10/100/1000 and buy a gigabit switch. Although the units themselves are only 10/100 the PC will not run them all with a 10/100 card. It drops out constantly and looses sync. \nSince installing the new card and new switch, all at a cost of about £30 it works perfectly. I can also set 2 of the units to be wireless access points and still get a decent speed while listening to music.\nMy son is on xbox (wired) and the TV streaming netflix.\nIt just seems very stable, suprisingly so!\n\nA: The maximum number of outputs are three to six in typical conditions.

I recently started using the Gmail app on my iOS devices because it has better search functionality than the native Mail app. However, that means that when I'm writing emails the app is using my Gmail contacts and not the local phone contacts, which is annoying. The solution is to keep my iCloud contacts, which currently sync between my Mac and my iOS devices, in sync with Google as well. What is the best way to do this? It appears that I can sync my computer's local contacts using Address Book, but that won't help with my contacts which are stored in iCloud.\n\nA: Here's a way that works effectively, but can be time consuming, so just warning all you guys.\nFirst, you go to iCloud.com and sign in. Go to your Contacts, and select all of them by pressing Ctrl + A. Then, you press that little gear button in the lower left-hand corner and click Export vCard.\nNow that you've downloaded your vCard file with all your contacts, you're probably wondering why there's only one file. I advise you not to open it. It will open this huge number of windows that you have to close one by one, which is especially tedious if you have a lot of contacts. I had to learn the hard way, so just a warning for you curious bunch that likes to click random things! \nAnyway, that aside, go to Google Contacts and click that tab on the right that says More. Click Import, and it should tell you to go to the old Contacts page, so do that and click Go to old Contacts. Click the Import Contacts... button on the lower left-hand corner, and select your file that you just downloaded from iCloud. It should import all your contacts into your Google account. Yay!\nAlso, about duplicates, there should be a notification saying to merge your duplicates. You should probably do that. You can also merge duplicates in the new Contacts page by clicking that tab thing on the right.\nIf you are going to use the native Mail app for your iPhone or Mac, just go to Settings and disable contacts for your iCloud account. That way, if you add a new contact, it'll go straight to your Google account!\n\nA: I have this setup too and using an Exchange account only for syncing contacts between Google and my iPhone. \nThe process is described here:\nhttp://support.google.com/a/users/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=138740\nSo I set up an Exchange account but ONLY syncing contacts.\nAnother video version here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVEf-skW-Kg \n\nA: I have used SyncMan to do exactly this in the past. SyncMan offers bidirectional sync that will offer you the opportunity to confirm changes (definitely a plus when syncing two differing address books!). However, I don't use the bidirectional sync feature. Instead, I do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Add/Edit all my contacts only in Apple's iCloud Contacts\n\n*Setup SyncMan to perform a uni-directional sync from iCloud to Google\n\n\nThis allows me to have my contacts accessible in Google and avoid any sync conflicts that may arise from bidirectional sync.\nGive the software a try (they offer a thirty day trial) but before you do (and as with any new program) make a backup of your data:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Contacts.app\n\n*File > Export... > Contacts Archive...\n\n\nNOTE: This solution requires you to use your Mac to sync to Google.\n\nA: I found it quick and easy to go to Settings -> Mail, Contacts, & Calendars -> Add Account -> Other -> Add CardDAV Account (under Contacts). Type google.com as Server, then type your Google email as username, password and click Done. \nI had to use the application specific-password because I have a 2-step verification security setting with google but apart from that it was the easiest and quickest way I have seen yet.\n\nA: it's very simple if you are using a mac. \njust setup in Contacts both accounts - iCloud & Gmail and then drag and drop ;)\nIf you open Contacts program on your Mac and then go inside the settings you can add an account for google.com. Just give your google username and password and server name google.com\nNow you can mark all contacts in the iCloud account in Contacs program and drag them to the Google account in contacts program\n \n\nA: \nA great way to do it is via a new third-party webapp ('ShuttleCloud') officially integrated now in Google Contacts.\nStep 1:\nGo to https://contacts.google.com\nStep 2:\nUnder the side menu on the left go to 'More' then 'Import'. Select 'Other email provider' (where Apple is mentioned) and input your Apple iCloud address (you had to choose an @icloud.com username when creating your iCloud account, find it at https://appleid.apple.com if nowhere else), follow the prompts and it will neatly import all iCloud account contacts into Google Contacts\nStep 3:\nGoogle Contacts then conveniently shows you that some imported contacts may need to be merged with existing ones (maybe ones from an earlier sync). The interface is clean and successful and you can manually merge individual contacts or do all at once after perusing the list.\nThis is by far the quickest and cleanest method I have found thus far, finally in 2016.\n\nA: It's actually quite simple. Just download the app entitled Contacts Sync from the App Store. With this app, you'll be able to quickly & easily transfer iCloud contacts to Google, and vice Versa. I downloaded several thousand in about 8 mins. Good Luck!\n\nA: Not a sync, but simple one time import from Google Contacts to iCloud is possible without any additional tools on Mac.\nSetup Contacts.app to Sync contacts on this computer grou with Google Account, \nthen select all Contacts on this computer and export them as vCard, you can be sure - it shows in the filename how much contacts it exports. \nThen select iCloud group and select File - Import, choose previous saved vCard file.\nIt shows you the duplicates, you can choose the policy of merging. After that all contacts will be in iCloud group.\n\nA: *\n\n*Switch On the Sync between your iPhone and iCloud by going to Settings > iCloud and switching Contacts ON. Be careful to check the iCloud website first to not duplicate or to remove a contacts that were still there and weren't used before. To make it easy, just delete all your contacts on iCloud website and then sync your contacts from your iPhone to iCloud by switching on your iCloud on from your iPhone again.\n\n*After you finish syncing between iCloud and iPhone, log in to the iCloud website and enter your username and password, check the Contacts Number down below by scrolling down the menu from the right column of words (A, B, C… #) and check the numbers and compare it with your phone, it should be the same.\n\n*Press the settings button on the bottom-left of the window on your computer. Choose Select All > Export. Then it should save the *.vcf file to the downloads folder.\n\n*Log in to your Google Mail account and then go to contacts, then choose Import from a file, then search for the exported file on your machine and choose it, then the files automatically will be add inside the contacts folder.\n\n\nNote: I understand that it's a little bit long way to do it but I'm sure that you will avoid duplication. You will find your contacts are up to date always from iPhone to iCloud to Google Contacts.\n\nA: The major issue is that you need contacts in Google to use google services, like sending Google calendar invitations or sharing docs via Drive, and you need contacts in iCloud to use iCloud services, like Pages or sending an email from iCloud.com. Seeing as the two are in increasing competition with each other, they will not play nicely, nor do they have any reason to. Your best logical bets are to use a third party tool to keep the two in sync, or only update contacts in one place and run a manual export, one-way, from one to the other. Unfortunately, in this scenario, you pay for automation.\n", "Q: Applescript to update year tag for audio files I have a lot of tracks in iTunes where the files are named \"music-NNNN.mp3\" with NNNN being the year the track was recorded.

Is there any way to tell iOS mail app to put emails from specific senders in a special folder automatically?\n\nA: If you’re using an iCloud mail account then you can go to http://icloud.com/#mail\nIn the top right of the screen there’s a preferences icon — looks like a cog. If you click on that the preferences pop-over opens, click on Rules and from there you can configure some basic rules to put messages into specified folders.\n\nA: I have a method that works using archive folders within an IMAP or Exchange email accounts.  Manually create your archive folders somewhere within your email folders list. The archive must be stored online, not locally. I use Outlook to create my folders manually, but i think it would work without Outlook as well like on your web access. Once the folders are created and you've previously moved messages to that folder, your iPhone remembers this.  So in the future once you've previously moved messages to these folders, new emails you get from that sender sender can be moved there very easily by using the move message feature inside mail. A pop-up will appear with 2 options; the previously used folder to quickly move the message there, or an option to select a new folder.  This usually works for different types of emails from the same sender as well, say you have a subfolder for \"Orders\" and \"Shipping Notifications\", it will remember which folder that email normally belongs. It's not automatic, and its not perfect, but very easy to do and pretty flawless. \n\nA: If you make them a VIP and use the VIP folder - YES.\nIf you don't use VIP, no - not in the mobile Mail app. You'll want to look into Gmail and the gmail app for that sort of server side filtering.\n\nA: Largely, the answer is \"No\". iOS default mail doesn't have some of the things that OS X Mail has such as rules. The good part is there are a few work-arounds.\nDepending on your needs, there are VIP mailboxes in iOS 6. These can be configured by tapping Mailboxes (back arrow) in the Mail app, and then tapping the arrow next to VIPs. There are several problems with this method, however. The biggest being, it puts those emails into the VIP folder AND the inbox. The other problem is it is just one \"folder\". \nFor many reasons, VIPs may be undesirable you, and the only other way to manage that would be to manually move them. Tap the Edit button above and on the right of the email list. Tap the emails you would like to move, and then tap Move, then select the folder to move them to.\nSide note: the only other way to do this would be through a service like Gmail, or using the OSX mail app.\nJust another side note: Rules can be used indirectly. If you use preference rules to sort email with the Mail.app on an Apple computer, the listing of emails in your inbox can be updated and sorted into folders on your iPhone, by opening the Mail.app on your phone using the icon that appears on your resting screen of the phone.  This syncs the email on your phone with what you have done on the computer.\n\nA: I have a solution that may not be for everyone as it involves Outlook on a permanently on PC. I use IMAP on my phone, the mail account in Outlook is always on and many rules in place, since the PC syncs every minute or so the rules are applied by Outlook. I get the occasional one that lands on the phone prior to the PC so does not get action-ed, apart from that it works well.\n", "Q: No calendar subscriptions showing up on iCloud.com I have a number of calendars on the Calendar app on my MacBook Pro (OS X Mountain Lion 10.8.2): along with the three standard iCloud calendars (Calendar, Home, Work) I have 7 subscriptions. I have tried a number of things, but it seems none of my calendars except the three standard ones want to appear on iCloud.com. Is this an irreparable bug with the Apple software/servers, or is there something I can do to fix this issue here?\nNote: It's odd that the calendars and indeed the list of iCloud subscriptions still seems to sync fine with my iPhone. It's just that none of them display on iCloud.com for whatever reason!\n\nA: This is likely because iCloud.com only has iCloud calendars. Chances are all the rest of your calendars are not iCloud. Honestly, I wouldn't see it as a bug, but something that they haven't added into the online portal. If you click the Settings icon and select Preferences in iCloud.com/#calendar it will not give you an option to add outside calendars.\nThey will still show up on your phone because it is tied in with your email. If you go to the email account that you are subscribed with, you should see Calendars set to \"On\".\n\nA: There is a workaround for this I have found, but essentially requires you to setup a local iCloud calendar then share it to another calendar provider online and then on that calendar subscribe to the ical\n", "Q: How do I configure dynamic DNS when my router does not support it? I have a MacBook which is connected to the net via an ancient DSL router (NAT enabled). I want to SSH into the server from elsewhere, but my ISP assigns new IP address every once in a while.\nI would like to use a dynamic DNS service for \"finding\" my Mac, but the router does not support any dynamic DNS functionality.\nWhat (lightweight) option is there to update the DNS service with current IP info anyway? I remember installing a clunky menu-bar app several years ago, and I would prefer something configurable from the terminal.\nNB: I feel it could be a problem when the MacBook is moved to a different network (friends, company) temporarily and attempts to connect to macbookaddress.dynamicdnz.tld suddenly hit their network. Correct?\n\nA: ddclient is what I use on my Linux boxes. Works really well.\nYou can find instructions details here: http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/ddclient\nI think all you would need to do to get ddclient to run is to a @reboot line to your crontab and you’re set. \ncrontab -e\n\nthen add this line:\n@reboot /usr/sbin/ddclient -daemon 300 -syslog\n\n\nA: You could install the Wide-Area Bonjour preference pane from Apple. Not only will this cause your MacBook to register itself in DNS when you are at home behind your router, but it will do it no matter where you are.\nIn the prefernce pane you can enter your hostname and the TSIG key the server requires for authenticating dynamic DNS update requests. There is a red light/yellow light/green light widget that shows you whether the dynamic DNS request is failed/in progress/successful.\nThe software is quite old and has some serious problems such as complete lack of IPv6 support, but it still works with at least basic functionality. There is a link to the source code on the above page in case someone wants to modernize it, but unfortunately the link doesn't lead to the source code.\n\nA: If you still need another way from your router itself working out of the box and you really know what you do, you can use DDNS-over-CWMP it's a simple Google Script code to capture IP changes periodically or if your router powered on or rebooted by using GS as ACS endpoint for your router in CWMP settings. I wrote it for DuckDNS.org and it works as expected. You can modify the code to work with any other DDNS provider too\n\n", "Q: For some reason I don't have an 'Automatically Add to iTunes' folder.

I want to send an email to a group of about 50 people, which is personalised at the very least with their name.

Be sure to retain the quotes wrapping it (and if you have any quotation marks within your message, you'll have to replace them with \n \\\"). Replace \"SUBJECT HERE\" similarly.\nWhen you click run, it will bring up a dialog to select which file you want to attach. It will then prompt you to select the recipients in the Contacts application (select multiple ones by holding down command ⌘ and clicking on each name). When you're done, click OK.

So if you have multiple emails for someone, you may run into problems. The easiest way around this is to create duplicate contact entries with a single email.\n\n*\n\n*If you have a lot of contacts with multiple emails, then you may need to look at a different solution for addressing the emails, which is outside the scope of this answer.\n\n\n*It will address it to the first name of the person. Change first name of contact to name of contact or last name of contact as desired.\n\n*You can add in an organization name somewhere, but it requires reformatting the body message and changing a bit of the code. Basically the body is assembled from the various parts on the my send_message… line, you'll have to change that depending on how you want to include the organization string.\n\n", "Q: Activating Mountain Lion screen saver from Applescript, part 2 This example was shown earlier:\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    set ss to screen saver \"Random\"\n    start ss\nend tell\n\nIs there an incantation instead of \"Random\" to display a slideshow from the selected folder in the screen saver preferences?\n\nA: On Mountain Lion (10.8)\nThis AppleScript will start the screen saver with the selected folder.\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    set ss to screen saver \"iLifeSlideshows\"\n    start ss\nend tell\n\nLion (10.7) and earlier\nFirst select the appropriate sources/folders by clicking the Shuffle item in the screen savers list, then checking one or more items in the dialog that appears.\nThen start the screen saver as as in the Mountain Lion section, but change iLifeSlideshows to screensaver.shuffle.\n\n", "Q: Is there a tool to detect log files that have been written to This is my first question to apple.stackexchange, hopefully it's on topic :)\nAs a developer, there are frequently things written to log files (exceptions or other status information) that I'm interested in.  My current workflow is that I simply tail -f /path/to/log when I know that I'm doing something where I may want to see the output of a log file.\nBut because of the nature of Magento development in particular, and I'd imagine most development work in general, many times you're not exactly aware of which log file might be getting written to, or even if you are, you may not remember to tail it and get stuck scratching your head at why something is happening or where to get some feedback on what's going on in your system.\nI've been daydreaming about a tool that I hope may exist - that would pop a little notification bubble when a log file is written to, and maybe when you click on it, it pops a terminal tail -f'ing it for you.  And for bonus points maybe even auto cascades terminals when you tail more than one log file.\nDoes anything like this exist?\n\nA: The console viewer app has bounce notifications in the preferences for that app.\n\nYou'll want to open a window with each log you are watching, but this app should cover most use cases of log file watching. Since Console retains window settings when you quit the App, you should only need to open the files once (or worst case, make a folder with aliases to each log you want and open them all from Finder to get a head start on the logs you like to watch). I'll also plug the Divvy tool for managing many windows.

In order to restore to the old backup, you will need to reset the device.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the Settings app, tap \"General\", and scroll down to \"Reset\"\n\n*After tapping Reset, tap \"Erase all Content and Settings\"\n\n*Follow the prompts to wipe the device\n\n*After the device is wiped you will be guided through several screens guiding you in setting the iPad\n\n*Tap \"Restore from iCloud\" when prompted\n\n*Select your old iPad backup from all of the backups you have listed (if you are restoring across model lines - say iPod to iPad, those backups will be listed below the iPad backups, but on the same screen as the rest of the backups)\n\n*Let it restore your backup\n\n*Celebrate\n\n\nScroll towards the bottom of this article for additional information on restoring your device. You sometimes need to update the OS on the device if a backup was made from a newer OS than you have running on the device doing the restore.\n\nA: When you get to the first few screens, one is the restore or new iPad screen. There you select restore from iCloud backup. If you go past this screen you will need to reset the device from the settings.\n\nA: HI go to recycle bin and click yourself.\n", "Q: Can I use an iPhone 4 on Straight Talk? I have an iPhone 4 that's currently on AT&T. My 2-year contract will be fulfilled in January, and at that point (if possible) I'd like to switch my service to Straight Talk or some other less expensive alternative, since I hardly use up my data/voice/text allotments on AT&T.\nA few questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*First, I assume my phone needs to be unlocked. Can I simply request that AT&T unlock it once my contract is up? How does that work?\n\n*Since I already have the phone, can I buy just a SIM from Straight Talk (or whoever)?\n\n*Does any of this require that the phone be jailbroken? I do not want to jailbreak\n\n\nA: Unlocking appears to be a pretty easy process. Just call them up or go online. Here's another article from Apple about it.\nAfter the phone is unlocked, you should be home free to swap SIM cards with no jailbreaking required at all. I've had multiple unlocked smartphones (Blackberrys which previously had data contracts) in the past, which come down to just pulling the SIM, and moving it to a new device. Apple started with just AT&T, and at that point made it difficult to change carriers, but things have changed, and particularly the iPhones 4/4S do quite well at switching networks. The two year data contract can also be confusing, because this is required if the phone is to be purchased at a lower price. After that, there is no ties, to speak of with the carrier that originally sold you the phone. \nAfter the contract ends (and in this case, it is unlocked), you can use the device as a iPod Touch (wifi) + phone. You could even get a prepaid SIM card (from AT&T) and use it without unlocking it.\n*Apparently (thanks to @jsd), you don't even need to unlock your phone. Switching to ST should be pretty easy for you.\n\nA: I have AT&T iPhone 4 which I purchased a StraightTalk sim and unlimited service plan ($45) from Walmart for. I Installed the AT&T micro sim from the ST sims pack. I then activated the sim online. \nAll you need to do is simply follow the activation instructions included with the sims/service plan kit you purchased.\nAfter it activated and updated to iOS 6, texting to non-iPhone users and non-wi-fi browsing did not work, so the APN settings have to be changed. However, the specific APN carrier settings fields are not accessible I used the www.unlockit.co.nz app (just go to that site using your phones browser using a wi-fi connection).  You will now have 3G browsing and text to non-iPhone user capability but can not MMS to non iPhone users.  I am still trying to get MMS working completely.  \nBy the way, iMessages worked even before the unlockit process is performed.\n", "Q: How to stop programs stealing focus when initializing a build in XCode? I'm currently using XCode in conjunction with Unity. When I initiate a build in Unity, it automatically runs XCode. XCode will then steal focus from whatever app I happen to be in. Is there a way of disabling apps stealing focus in OSX?\n\nA: You can add this to the Info.plist of Xcode to make it launch in the background:\n<key>LSBackgroundOnly</key>\n<string>True</string>\n\n(You might need to get write privileges on the Info.plist if you downloaded Xcode from the Mac App Store)\nSource and details about what it can break: http://reviews.cnet.com/8301-13727_7-20085680-263/keep-applications-from-stealing-focus-when-opening-in-os-x/\n", "Q: How effective is Deep Sleep Mode? I got frustrated from turning on my Retina MBP and waiting a few seconds while the systems  loads from Deep Sleep Mode.\nI disabled it using sudo pmset -a standby 0\nHowever, I would like to know what I am missing now. Will I start losing a lot of battery power while the laptop is sleeping normally (basically not in Deep Sleep Mode) ?\nFor example, in 1 hour (or 2-5 hours), how much percentage will battery I lose on Sleep mode, and how much would I lose when its in Deep Sleep Mode ?\n\nA: Your Mac might last a week in sleep where it might last a month in deep sleep.\nIf you travel with a power adapter or would rather end up with no battery than wait a few seconds longer each wake, then keep deep sleep turned off.\n\nA: The 13-inch MacBook Pro with Retina Display has a 74 watt-hour battery. It uses about 0.86W in sleep mode and 0.30W when off (or in standby mode), which translates to about 3.6 and 10.3 days.\nStandby mode is only enabled after 70 minutes of normal sleep, so there won't be any difference after an hour. After that, normal sleep would use about 1.2% of the maximum capacity per hour and standby mode about 0.4%.\nIf you paid 0.15 USD per kilowatt hour for electricity and kept the MacBook Pro in sleep mode (with standby mode disabled) for 15 hours per day, it would cost about 0.70 USD per year.\nPower Nap might increase power consumption, but it's not enabled on battery power.\n", "Q: Why is Lion’s “Keep Both” option missing from the file copy dialog? I am running Mountain Lion (10.8.2), and when I attempt to copy a bunch of files from Directory A to Directory B (which contains some files with names matching those from Directory A), I get this dialog:\n\nIn Lion, there used to be the extremely handy “Keep Both” option here. It would copy the conflicting files over and append a “1” or “2” or similar to each one’s filename so I could have them in the same directory. For my purposes here, this is exactly what I want. But that option is now missing, and all I get is “Skip,” “Stop,” and “Replace.”\nCan I get the “Keep Both” option back? If not, can I otherwise duplicate this behavior?\nEdit: I am aware of the idea of holding down option when copying, but I have tried it both in copying (⌥⌘C) and pasting (⌥⌘V) in different instances, and it has never changed anything about this dialog, even on 10.8.2, which is what I am on and also what it is said to work for sure on. :(\n\nA: The Keep Both button seems to turn to Skip when there are five or more items with duplicate names. It should change back to Keep Both when you hold option in the dialog though.\n\nA: I simply used the Alt button in the Dialog box to switch it to \"Keep Both\" mode.\n", "Q: How can I gift a copy of an app that I already own? I own an app. I want to purchase an additional copy of that app for a friend using iTunes' gift functionality. In the iOS App Store and the iTunes store on a Mac, the gift option doesn't appear for apps that I already own. I can't believe that Apple doesn't let you purchase an additional copy of something that you already own as a gift for someone else.\n\nApp that I own\n\n\nApp that I don't\n\n\nAm I missing something, or is app gifting really this half baked?\n\nA: The gift function is embedded in the small triangle control to the right of the Buy|Download text - almost looking like it's the same button on iTunes for a computer.\n\nJust click the square button and select Gift This App. On iOS you will want to press the rectangle with the arrow key and select Gift.\n\n\nA: If you hit the \"share\" button (if I'm calling it that correctly, it looks like a square with an arrow pointing up from it).  One of the options is \"gift\".\n\nA: In the iTunes store, you can log out of our account, and then the \"gift this\" option will appear. You can click the option, and then it will prompt you to re-enter you Apple ID but you can still go through with the purchase.\n", "Q: Is there a good one hand typing Mac app?

We had a 2TB drive for photos and a 2TB drive for the Time Machine backup of those photos.  The Time Machine backup drive has run out of space and we realized that it's time that we can remove photos from the main photo drive (and burn DVD backups) anyways.  Since Time Machine keeps deleted files, simply deleting them from the main drive won't help us in freeing up the space on the Time Machine drive.  What is the correct way to handle this problem?\n\nA: Here is a Q&A covering manual ways of cleaning backups.\n\n\n*\n\n*How can I manually delete old backups to free space for Time Machine?\nYou can always just wait for Time Machine to delete old backups as there really is no need to free up space on the backup volume. In cases where you may need to recover old backups and don't have a proper archiving solution, some people archive the entire drive once it fills and start with a clean one.\nAs a photographer almost always has a separate archiving solution, letting Time Machine manage the backup space is often a workable plan and maintains a good 6 months of deleted data in all the cases I've seen on 2 TB drives.\n", "Q: infection in ~Library/Application Support/Mobilesync/Backup/xxxxx ClamX is finding phishing infection in the Backup folder on my MacBook Pro with 10.7.\n~Library/Application Support/Mobilesync/Backup/xxxxxxxx\nDoes this mean that either my iPhone or Mac is infected?\nI realize I can delete these files, but is that enough?\nWhat's the risk and what's the resolution?\n\nA: It does not mean that your Mac or iPhone is infected and you should not delete the file.\nFrom Wikipedia: \n\nPhishing is the act of attempting to acquire information such as usernames, passwords, and credit card details (and sometimes, indirectly, money) by masquerading as a trustworthy entity in an electronic communication. Communications purporting to be from popular social web sites, auction sites, online payment processors or IT administrators are commonly used to lure the unsuspecting public. Phishing emails may contain links to websites that are infected with malware. Phishing is typically carried out by e-mail spoofing or instant messaging, and it often directs users to enter details at a fake website whose look and feel are almost identical to the legitimate one.\n\nSo ClamAV has found a spoofed email stored somewhere in your iPhone Backup. Unless you clicked on the the links in the email, that's no problem.\nHowever, if you delete the file, you will break the backup of your iPhone.\nThe best solution is to either:\n\n\n*\n\n*tell ClamAV not to scan the folder; or\n\n*tell iTunes to encrypt your iPhone backups so that ClamAV won't be able to scan them.\n\n\nA: My Sophos Anti-Virus v8.0.13C, engine 3.42.10 just warned me about the exact same location (and an additional subfolder) on my MacBook Pro 10.8.3.\nI am also running ClamXav (v. latest) which did not(yet?) detect it.

I was wondering how good thunderbolt is for adding a beefier PCI graphics card to my MacBook Air.\nIf I use a PCI enclosure like this, will the card integrate with the Mac to enhance the performance of the computer or a display? \n\nA: Unfortunately, there isn't currently a graphics card on the market that has a Thunderbolt-aware driver.  Without that, the solution isn't going to work.  All of the manufacturers of such enclosures have stated that there is significant demand for exactly what you're inquiring about here, and you might be best served to join some of their mailing lists to keep up with changes, i.e. cards that become compatible.  Magma for instance, has a list of \"coming soon\" cards on their site for their particular enclosure, but not a single graphics card.  Yet.\nDon't also forget - Thunderbolt in its current state has a theoretical maximum bandwidth of 10Gbps (that's gigabits), or 1.25 gigabytes, per second and is made up of a DisplayPort signal coupled with PCIe 2.0 x4.\nAs you may be aware, most high end graphics cards on the market are PCI 2.0 (or even 3.0 now) and run best with an x8 slot or ideally, x16.  That kind of bandwidth — from 4GB/s on PCIe 2.0 x8 to 16GB/s on PCIe 3.0 x16 — is way over the ability of Thunderbolt.\nSo, even if there is eventually a card that would work, with a Thunderbolt-enabled driver that was available for your Mac - you won't likely get much more performance out of it that you couldn't get out of, say, the GeForce 650M chip in the current 15-inch Retina MacBook Pro (mid-2012).\nFor practicality's sake, I'd suggest thinking about how if your current laptop's graphics capabilities don't suit your needs, perhaps you might consider upgrading.  It will be likely be a long time before there's a card that will run in the configuration you are contemplating.\n\nA: I have read nothing but high marks for this sort of PCI expansion when you want to get any PCI card to work with a Mac.\nAs long as the card itself would work when it's in a Mac Pro, there's no reason to think an Air wouldn't recognize it. Any program that can offload calculations to the GPU would see a speed boost, but unless you ran an external monitor - the built in display of your Air would still be driven by the on-board GPU and not the external GPU.\n\nA: The idea is a solid one on the way. First off you DON'T NEED an external monitor unless it is on the Mac operating system. This isn't much a problem as macs can EASILY do boot camp.  You can use Nvidia Optimus software or LucidLogix GPU virtuMVP software to just offload the rendering of the integrated GPU onto any other discrete GPU ergo the external card. The problem isn't the external enclosure or the virtuMVP software. I talked to lucidlogix and they stated it WILL work provided the driver installs correctly and they wont because PCI Express dont play nice with thunderbolt sadly. So screw the bandwidth because many others have tried it with PCIE x1 via expresscard or the x1 slot beneath the laptop (windows long time ago) & anyway thunderbolt 2 is comin out so that there is double but regardless, you WILL see performance in general. Now there are hacks to getting cards to work externally however, they were based off of the old methods. http://www.journaldulapin.com/2013/08/24/a-thunderbolt-gpu-on-a-mac-how-to/\nTry if you want but those methods require expresscard. It's on its way, I can't try this out myself because I can't afford those external thunderbolt chassys at the moment & they dont sell em in circuits like the old methods :(\n\nA: They do have them, for PCIe cards.\nhttp://eshop.macsales.com/shop/Thunderbolt/PCIe_Chassis/Mercury_Helios/\n", "Q: Do I need to set up individual Apple IDs for all my kids' iPads? I will be giving my three children three iPads as their christmas presents.  I am now currently using my iPhone 4 with my only one Apple ID for the App Store.\nMy question is if I set up their iPads using my Apple ID that I am currently using now, does that mean that if they download a game or anything from the App Store, will it appear on my iPhone 4 as well?  And if I delete the app from my iPhone, will it delete on their iPad too?  If that the case, should I set up a different Apple ID for them?\n\nA: I want to just answer the questions without making a recommendation since I can see many reasons that different people will want different account setups.\nYou can use one Apple ID for all the devices. If you want to turn off automatic download, you won't see the apps on your devices. If you delete the app from one device it does not delete it from the others. Even if you hide the purchase from your purchase history, the other devices can still re-download the app for free.\nYou only want to set up a second Apple ID if you want to let them control their purchases and budget (and not see their purchases in your purchase history). You can set restrictions to prevent age ratings and download blocks on a per-device limit and that is not tied to the Apple ID.\nThere is a limit where you will start having issues where more than 10 devices want to pull apps from one Apple ID, but even with 4 children devices, you still have 6 slots for yourself.\n\nA: Separate accounts with individual gift cards pre-loaded on each account might help teach the kids how to budget.\n\nA: I have setup 25 iPads for a school before and Until we turned on the apple volume licenses, it did download to all devices because the option was set in \nSettings -> iTunes & App Stores.\nOn your phone if you turn off Automatically Download Apps from the above Settings area then you should be ok and it not automatically download apps after they purchase apps if you use the same Apple ID.  You can also set Music and Books.  Deleting from your phone will not affect their iPad.\nFor a lab I would recommend turning off the automatically download but for several kids I would recommend that you use one account.\nFor a group of small kids I would recommend one app, you don't have to buy the same app several times over.  It might cause issues with GameCenter to only have one account for those games that keep data and records based on gamecenter.  You can create multiple accounts there and solve that issue.\nKeeping one account will also help with security and child management settings.  You can view the amount left on the gift card and you will get email notifications when apps are purchased.  Mine is tied to my paypal account, so I would get the emails if apps are purchased.  You can set restrictions and manage parental controls on a mac to set age limits that you want the kids to be viewing for materials such as songs, videos, etc.\nHave fun!\n\nA: you can't give them an ID if they are under 13 :( \nyou can easily manage what apps turn up on your phone, the real problem for families is this: if I give them their own IDs do they can't share apps or music, can they? And we are still not dealing with the bigger issue: they aren't supposed to have appleIDs at their age. \n\nA: I strongly recommend you keep a separate ID for each person. When buying a song, for instance, you can share among 5 authorized devices. My computer, iPad, iPod, and iPhone make four. \nNow that my wife and daughter have iPhones, and daughter, a MacBook, I glad they have their own accounts. No crazy apps I don't know about clogging my devices. \nYou want your own apple ID and iCloud. Really.\nEdit - Using your Apple ID for Apple services will help clarify the iTunes vs iCloud ID usage. \n\nA: Depends on how old the children are.  If they are 15 and above, you may want them to maintain their own accounts and identity on the devices.  Otherwise, you may want to be able to monitor what they put on their devices.  It looks like a management problem, not a technical one.\nYou can set up your iDevices to either download purchases automatically or not.  If you delete an app from one device, it has no effect on its presence on other devices.\nThe downside to using different apple IDs is that if there is an app you want on all of them, and you don't want to buy 4 copies of the same thing, then managing their installation and upgrades is a pain.  You will have to sign out of their account, sign in with yours, download the app, sign out, and sing back in with original account.  Repeat.  Repeat.\nIf you set up all of them using your own apple ID, that means you will have to buy them any apps they want to put on their device.  Unless you are comfortable giving them the password to your account on the iTMS and the credit card authorization that is attached to it.  And you have to make sure not to set up iCloud sync, because then they will also get your reminders, calendar events, photo stream, and any iTunes music.\n\nA: iOS8 introduced a new Family Sharing feature; I would recommend that you keep separate IDs and invite your children to your account as family members:\n\nFamily Sharing\nA new way to bring harmony to your family’s digital\nlife.\nFamily Sharing makes it easy for up to six people in your family\nto share each other’s iTunes, iBooks, and App Store purchases without\nsharing accounts. Pay for family purchases with the same credit card\nand approve kids’ spending right from a parent’s device. And share\nphotos, a family calendar, and more to help keep everyone connected.\nGet organized.\nTo get started, one adult in your household — the\norganizer — invites up to five additional family members and agrees to\npay for any iTunes, iBooks, and App Store purchases they initiate\nwhile part of the family group. Once family members join, the features\nof Family Sharing are set up on everyone’s devices automatically.\nAll your family’s purchases on all your family’s devices.\nEverything’s better when shared, and sharing has never been easier.\nOnce you’ve set up Family Sharing, all the songs, albums, movies, TV\nshows, books, and apps ever purchased by family members are\nimmediately available to everyone else in the group. And, of course,\nso are new purchases. The content appears automatically in the\nPurchased tab in iTunes, iBooks, or the App Store for each family\nmember. Just select the family member whose collection you’d like to\nbrowse, then download or play the content you choose. Other family\nmembers can access your collection in the same way. If you want to\nkeep some purchases private, you can choose to hide individual items.\nMaking purchases is easy. So is setting limits.\nAll new iTunes, iBooks, and App Store purchases initiated by family\nmembers will be billed to the organizer’s account. But the organizer\ncan still call the shots. Just turn on Ask to Buy for children in the\nfamily. When a child initiates a purchase, an alert is sent to the\norganizer, who can review the download and approve or decline it right\nfrom the organizer’s device. This applies to both purchases and free\ndownloads.\n\nMore Information: https://www.apple.com/icloud/family-sharing/\n", "Q: Why doesn't tar recognize .iso files, even though the documentation says it should? man tar says that OS X's tar implementation should be able to extract .iso files.\n\ntar creates and manipulates streaming archive files.

From there of course it can be shuffled by song or album (Controls > Shuffle...). Its technically a workaround and I too hope \"Apple will update the shuffle feature for Upnext in a future iTunes update.\"\n\nA: You can option-click the shuffle button at the top of an album to queue it in a random order. Oddly, if I do that for the artist it only adds the first song in the list. Weird. And you can't intermingle different albums like this, you have to do that manually in the Up Next panel.\nCorrection: if you go to Artists view, select All Artists and then option-click the shuffle button next to one of the artist names, it will queue all the songs by that artist in a random order. If you select an individual artist and do it, it will only queue the first song.\n", "Q: Can one still sort By Album By Year in any of the views in iTunes 11? In previous versions of iTunes, it was possible to sort songs by Artist, and then by Album By Year, so that albums would be shown in the order they were released, rather than alphabetical order.\nI can't find a way to replicate this behaviour in any of the various views in iTunes 11: In the Songs view, I can only sort by a single column, and in the other views where songs are grouped by albums, the albums are always displayed in alphabetical order.\nIs there an option I'm missing, or is sorting by Album By Year no longer an option?\n\nA: While in the albums view go to the view menu and select viewing options (command+j) and choose sort by year.\nHere is a screenshot (in german but I hope you get the important points).\n\n\nA: In artist view press command+j (Mac) or ctrl+j (windows).\nThen select \"sort albums by year\" in the popup.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro has to recover from Safe Sleep after 50% of all sleeps, although power is connected When I wake my MacBook Pro from sleep it sometimes has to recover from Safe Sleep, even though the power is connected.\nI have installed 16 GB (2x8) RAM myself on my MacBook, however 8 GB is the max supported RAM.\nCould this be why it fails to wake from sleep quickly?\nIs there an error log stating why it had to recover from Safe Sleep?\nBy recovering from Safe Sleep I mean this:\n\npmset -g:\n\nActive Profiles:\nBattery Power       -1\nAC Power        -1*\nCurrently in use:\n standbydelay         4200\n standby              0\n womp                 1\n halfdim              1\n hibernatefile        /var/vm/sleepimage\n sms                  1\n networkoversleep     0\n disksleep            10\n sleep                0 (sleep prevented by )\n autopoweroffdelay    14400\n hibernatemode        3\n autopoweroff         1\n ttyskeepawake        1\n displaysleep         5\n acwake               0\n lidwake              1\n\n\nA: Apple says the reason is to comply with the European Energy Standards.

A few days ago I found my free disk space is too low, so I tried to clean un-necessary files form disk myself and using some programs like CleanGenius. \nThere was 1.7 GB free, but after a while I found the free space is again zero. Again I cleaned up some other files and had 1GB free, but after a few hours I found the free space is again a few megabytes. \nDuring this time I have not installed new program, downloaded new things, or copied any files to my computer. \nThis is not new to me, once before I cleaned up 7GB of my disk and after a few hours I found my free disk space is close to zero. \nDo you have any suggestion why this happens and how can I prevent it? I have up-to-date registered anti-virus.\n\nA: I found my problem to be from Mail application. When it was open, the disk free space was reduced every minute. \nI just removed my Gmail account from the Mail application and about 40GB was recovered back to my free space! Also the automatic decrease of free space is stopped now.\n", "Q: Mail application captures huge disk space I found my startup disk free space to be very low and decreasing every minute without any files be downloaded or copied to my Macbook pro. I stopped running programs one by one and found when I stop Mail application (the original apple Mail) my free space is not decreasing anymore.\nI had two email accounts assigned to my Mail application to be synchronized: my Gmail and the academic email account. I just removed Gmail from the Mail application and at once 40GB was restored to my free space!!!\nAnd my question: While GMail has only 10GB quota (and I have used much less than this quota) how the Gmail account on the Mail application can capture 40GB of disk space? Is there any solution to use Gmail account active on Mail application, but with small disk space being used?\n\nA: Check that your are not keeping a copy of every email you've received, with their attachments. Under Mail / Preferences / Accounts, by selecting your account and then Advanced, you'll find an option regarding this matter.\nThere are several options which may help you saving some space.\n\n\nA: I think the problem is because of the IMAP folder synching and the attachments contained in e-mails in this folders: Attachments in folders are not only pointers to the original file, but synchronized (thus downloaded and stored on your hard disc) for each of the IMAP/GMAIL-folders one E-Mail is in. So if one e-mail is in 5 folders, the attachment will be stored 5 times. I'm not 100% sure about that, but this is my guess.\nSo head to the Webinterface of Gmail, open the settings and find the \"labels\" tab. Uncheck all unnecessary folders, so that they will not be synchronized between Mail.app and Gmail. Now much less disc space should be used.\n", "Q: Auto mute macbook on headphone removal I often listern to music on my macBook - when I unplug my headphones occasionaly forget to mute the speaker - so the whole office gets an earfull.  How can I set my mac to be muted unless headphones are plugged in. I'm interested to know if I can simply deactivate the built in speakers... \nThis has become more obvious recently when I use a bluetooth headset or similar - I walk away from the machine forgetting the headset is attached and as soon as I get far enought away my computer starts making noise.... \n\nA: I like to use the ControlPlane app for this. An added bonus is you can do more than just mute/unmute, such as turning dock auto-hiding off or on depending on whether you have external monitors attached or not.\nHere is the setup I use:\n\n\n*\n\n*On the Contexts tab of ControlPlane's preferences, add a context named Headphones and another named Speakers. \n\n*On the Evidence Sources tab, ensure that the Audio Output evidence source is enabled\n\n*On the Rules tab, click the Add (+) button, select Add Audio Output Rule..., and set the following options:\na. Audio output going to: Internal speakers \nb. Context: Speakers\nc. Confidence: 100% (Drag slider all the way to the right)\n\n*Repeat step (3) with the following settings:\na. Audio output going to: Headphones\nb. Context: Headphones\nc. Confidence: 100%\n\n*On the Actions tab, click the Add (+) button, select Sound and Music Actions > Mute and set the following options:\na. Toggle muting of system audio: Mute system audio\nb. at context: Speakers\nc. On arrival\n\n*Repeat step (5) with the following settings:\na. Toggle muting of system audio: Unmute system audio\nb. at context: Headphones\nc. On arrival\nIf you would prefer to have a single context, you can get by with that as well by (for example) having a Headphones context with mute on departure from the context.\n\nA: Unplug/disconnect your headphones, and mute the system volume. For added security, turn the volume all the way down. Plug in your headphones, and your volume should remain the same. The system will automatically switch between mute/no volume and the volume you have set for your headphones.\nThis is something that works on at least OSX 10.8 (I can't speak for sure on older versions of OSX), and a late 2008 or later Macbook. I tested it on both bluetooth and corded headphones.\n\nA: So I wrote a Mac app to do just that - automatically mute the volume when headphones get disconnected. It's called AutoMute and is available for $2.99 on the App Store, or you could just build from the source available on github for free.\n\nA: I just heard about Breakaway which automatically disable the built-in speakers when headphones are removed (but only by manually connect/disconnect the jack), you should try it !\nSome others (but non free) solutions would be to set up an automatic mute script whenever the audio output is changed with Keyboard Maestro or EventScripts\nFor exemple, with EventScript:\n\n\n*\n\n*Click on Open Folder from EventScripts menu in order to open the scripts folder.\n\n*Add the script you want to be triggered, in your case something like do shell script \"osascript -e 'set volume 0'\" (note that set volume function works from 0 to 7, 0 being mute and 7 maximum volume).\n\n*Click on Choose Script from EventScripts menu and select the script to be used.\n\n*Add the event Headphone disconnected.\n\n\nSee my own setup as exemple to quit or launch Boom whenever headphone or Bluetooth device (and you can choose wich device will trigger the script in bluetooth menu) is connected or disconnected:\n\n", "Q: My FaceTime cannot be activated I got an iPad 2 running iOS 6.0.1. and I really have no idea why my FaceTime cannot be activated.\nI always got an error while log in (username or password is incorrect)\nBut actually the Apple ID and password is correct and it can be used for downloading apps and iMessage.\n\nA: This error is only set to appear if your username or password is indeed incorrect, it doesn't fire by random. My advice would be to reset your password using iForgot.\n\nA: I had this same issue, so I called apple phone support, and told them about the problem, and it worked fine.  I was on my mac (10.8) and it said Your password was incorrect even though it was correct.\nIf you still are having the issue, try giving apple tech support a call\n\nA: I just have the feeling because of the lack of an accepted answer to state the correct answer down here:\nAlways try changing your password first. If that does not help you can look for further causes, but it will fix the issue in most cases. The same counts for iCloud giving issues, just be sure you log out completely and you have to enter your Apple ID all over again. (I've got a similar issue when I changed my Apple ID email address to a new one. I had to log out completely on all devices to get it to work properly.)\n\n\n*\n\n*Just change your password as it might have been expired.\n\n\nA: If I remember correctly it's because the certificate in your iPad for FaceTime has expired. You should be able to get it working again by simply updating your iPad.\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/TS3367\nThis article used to specify which iOS version needs to be updated, now its simplified to just telling users to keep their device up-to-date.\n", "Q: Application that allows you to customize which keys to use for mousekeys Is there an application for customizing mouse-keys, specifically choosing which keys to use?\nI don't have a numpad so I can't use the built-in mouse-keys.\n\nA: The predefined settings in KeyRemap4MacBook aren't really usable, but you can add custom settings by creating a private.xml.\n\nSee the source for the virtual keycode constants and the predefined settings.\n", "Q: \"DYLD_\" terminal error? So, I've done some searching.. and still haven't found a solution for this. I'm not even sure what has caused it. There are no DYLD_ or LD_ flags being set at all, but I always see this when I open the terminal up.\ndyld: DYLD_ environment variables being ignored because main executable (/usr/bin/login) is setuid or setgid\n\nWould definitely appreciate help with this.\n\nA: So, apparently it was the new Umbrella client by OpenDNS causing this error. I uninstalled it and continued to get this error until I restarted, which was making me think that it was something other than this client. However, after some testing.. it's confirmed that it's this client that's causing it.\nSo, yeah..

How do I get disk usage information on my 'Machintosh HD' icon on my desktop?\nI did it on my old computer, so I know it's possible, but can't seem to find the option again.\nI am on MacOSX 10.8.2.\n\nA: Right-click a blank location (e.g. not on an icon) on your desktop and click 'Show View Options'.\nCheck the 'Show item info' box:\n\nThe effect happens immediately.\n\nA: Command i will show you the info panel for any file or folder in finder\n", "Q: What is this white 'No items selected' popup box in save/open dialogs? On a Mac running Lion, in the Save As dialog boxes for seemingly all applications, there's a white popup box that appears and disappears on pressing the space bar. I notice it a lot as I use a graphics tablet with one of the pen buttons set to pan / scroll the page, which in adobe creative suite applications on a Mac, maps to the space bar everywhere in the application including OS dialogs - so I often trigger it by accident when trying to scroll through directories when saving files. \nHere's an image of it:\n\nIt took a while to figure out it was the space bar that was bringing it up (since I wasn't ever actually pressing the space bar...). Its close 'x' button seems not to work, so until I figured out (just now, actually) that it was the space bar that toggled it, I couldn't get rid of it most times it unexpectedly popped up. Dragging files into it doesn't seem to do anything, which discounts my theory that it's some kind of collector for overwriting multiple files at once. Nor does clicking on files or folders to select them. What is it and what is it for?\n\nA: I figured out the answer while confirming a few behaviours of the mystery white box while writing the question. I'm posting and answering the question anyway since none of my searches turned up anything.\n\nSo it seems it's the File Preview box: if you hit space in the 'Open Files' dialog with a file selected, a similar box gives you an enlarged preview of whatever file is selected. \nIn the 'Save As' dialog, however, you can't select files (clicking just copies the file name), so it will always come up as 'No items selected' any time it comes up. While you can select folders in the Save As dialog, it doesn't attempt to preview them and continues simply saying that nothing is selected.\nHere's a screen grab of it functioning by previewing the screen grab of itself not functioning:\n\nSeems like it can never show anything other than 'No items selected' in the Save As dialog.\n", "Q: Add SSD to iMac: Thunderbolt or internal? Is there any thunderbolt SSD which can be as fast or at least not much slower than internal one from OWC? I want to use is as system disk. It will be good to have two thunderbolt ports on this thing to daisy chain display.\nIt will be also a big bonus if I can buy it in Europe (because of specifics of organization where I am working).\n\nA: Thunderbolt is 10 Gb/s. Internal ones use SATA II or III at 3 or 6 Gb/s, respectively.\nHowever the Thunderbolt ones use SATA III internally. So you won't see any difference.\n", "Q: How can I combine PDF files and automatically create a table of contents? I have a bunch of PDF files named, say, chapter1, chapter2, etc. I would like to combine them into a single file and create a table of contents where each file gets an entry.\nIf memory serves, there used to be a tool called CombinePDFs that could do that, but it was written as a RealBASIC application and does not seem to work on OS X 10.8 anymore.\nAny alternative suggestion?\nNote: it's really about the automatic table of contents feature; I know how to merge/join/combine PDF files without one.\n\nA: PDF Pen Pro 6 is my weapon of choice for this sort of advanced processing task.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pdfpenpro-6/id609313570?mt=12\nI find in PDF handling software on the Mac, you generally get what you pay for. This is premium software for advanced tasks and scripting. Their lighter version might suit your two needs as well, so check before buying.\n\nA: Sejda PDF is an online and desktop cross platform toolset for editing PDF files.\nThe Merge PDF tool has an option to create a table of contents based on:\n\n*\n\n*Names of files being merged\n\n*Titles of documents being merged\n\nIt has another 2 features that works nicely combined with generating the TOC:\n\n*\n\n*Generating top level bookmarks for each merged file (can wrap existing bookmarks)\n\n*Adding the filename/document name to the footer of each merged page (to identify the source document)\n\nSejda PDF is free to use within limits (3 tasks per day, 50 pages max per merge - not much for a merged document).\n\n\nA: PDFCombo, new free app for Mac OS X, combines PDFs and preserves the table of contents. It can also add a TOC entry based on filename to link to first page of every contributing PDF in the combined PDF.\nDownload here: http://www.onekerato.com/downloads.html\n\nA: If you use the 'Combine / Merge to single PDF option in Acrobat Pro 9' this makes one PDF where the TOC has an entry for each file.\nUnfortunately this is not freeware.\n\nA: Calibre appears to be a freeware solution that you could use to break down these PDFs into files that you could use inside iBA, which would allow you to create a ToC with the newly added files and export the final product as a PDF. Definitely more time consuming than the method mentioned for Acrobat, but less expensive.\nCalibre E-Book Management\n\nA: PDFOutliner is available in the Mac App Store and works great for me when I need to create or edit a Table of Contents.  I want to note that this application does not appear to be a good solution for combining the PDF documents.  But once they are combined -- perhaps with some of the free solutions mentioned here -- this very inexpensive app does a good job of managing the ToC.\n\nA: I had the same problem and I found that pdfsam (pdf split and merge) available freely for different platforms, does this job, it may create clickable TOC. \n\nA: For those who don't know the first merge step, open both in Preview. Then drag on PDF icon on top of the other ones. More details here. It doesn't require additonal software.\n\nA: You can start by using preview's \"INSERT\" option. \nStart by opening pdf(1), then click on \"EDIT\" then \"INSERT\" (pdf2) from file. \n", "Q: Replacement for iPod.app on old iPhone 3G with large buttons for play/pause and prev/next track I've dedicated my old iPhone 3G as a Bluetooth audio player.

I often jump to the next song when I just wanted to pause the current song.\nAre there any iOS 4.2.1 apps out there to fit my needs?  I found Big Button Music Player, which is the type of thing I'm looking for, but the current version requires iOS 5 or greater.\nAny recommendations for apps to play the music I already have on my phone, and provide a UI with larger buttons?\n\nA: You can try Track 8 - swipe to change tracks - but I'm not sure whether it is iOS 5 or later.\n", "Q: How do I make Mountain Lion read iMessage texts as they come in?

However if Apple gives iMessage support to Automator you can write an Automator script to do that and when the message arrived you can initiate that script from iMessage->Preferences->Alerts \n", "Q: Can the Finder Dock be fixed to show all icons of aliases instead of some? I have a folder in my dock full of aliases to applications. When I add a new alias, the icon doesn't usually show up in the Dock folder:\n\nbut the icons are there in the Finder window for the same folder in every case. Usually the icons will show up eventually (with no clear indication of what triggers the fix), but these 4 apps have been stuck without an icon for some time and through a reboot. I have this now on Mountain Lion, but the same thing happened in Lion. \nDoes anyone know how to fix things (preventative or remedial) so the Dock will display icons properly?\n\nA: I was able to work around this by dragging the folder out of the Dock to remove it, then dragging the folder back from the Finder into the Dock. I'd still love to know if there's something that would fix it in place, but this is working for me now.\n\nA: Does making a folder of aliases in, say, Documents, and using them from there - rather than direct aliases from apps - does that help?\n", "Q: How to enable USB android tethering on OS X Mountain Lion without using Easy-Tether (Lite) I can tether fine to Windows 7, but on my Mac OS X Mountain Lion, it does not recognize the USB network.  I can install Easy-Tether (Lite) but that comes with some restrictions (e.g. no secure web pages, so no gmail), so I'd like to use the built in tethering of Cyanogenmod 7 that I have on my Android phone.\nIs there anyway to fix the Mac OS X Mountain Lion install so that it properly recognizes the USB network connection?\n\nA: I'm guessing this isn't your preference, but the paid version of Easy Tether comes with the appropriate Mac OS X kernel extensions - so you could just pay the one time fee (currently $10) to have this feature programmed by someone who has done the work.\nI'm fine with you not selecting this answer, but wanted it here for others that might need a solution that gets around the restrictions in the Lite version of the tethering software.\n", "Q: Can't get TV show name to display I imported a set of .mov files as a TV show, or at least I tried to.\nI imported them into iTunes, set them to the same \"Show\" name, numbered them as season 1, episodes 1-6. I also named them \"Episode One\", \"Episode Two\", etc. I also marked them as \"Media kind: TV Show\".\nEverything looks fine in iTunes. The problem is when I sync them to my iPhone, when I look in Videos, under TV Shows, it shows \"Episode One\" as the name of the show.\nSo for example, on my iPhone, under TV shows I might see: Breaking Bad (4 episodes), Mad Men (2 episodes), House (3 episodes), Episode One (6 episodes).\nHow can I make the iPhone display the show name? Both \"Show\" and \"Sort Show\" are set, but the iPhone seems to be ignoring them...\n\nA: You will want to check the following fields - they are the ones I see on iOS 6 when I sync a TV show to my iPhone:\n\n\n*\n\n*Video tab: Show and Season Number\n\n*Info tab: Name and Album\n\n\nThe information from the first item (Video tab) is shown in the top level view of the Videos app and the second line (Info tab) gets shown when you drill down to see the episodes that have synced over to the phone. If you sync to an iPad, more details are shown in the video app - but the core 4 items above are shown there as well.\n\nA: I had the same problem, today on an iPhone 6 with latest iTunes (Windows) + iOS versions. Three series of Breaking Bad: all titles, series + episode numbers entered correctly and showing up fine in iTunes. After sync, all were viewable on the phone but nowhere did 'Breaking Bad' show up as a name. To fix it, all I did was 'Get Info' individually for each series 1 episode and typed in 'Breaking Bad' under 'grouping'. After the sync, all episodes of all three series showed up correctly, including the series 2 and 3 episodes which I didn't even edit. \n\nA: i had exactly the same problem. i put the show name in under \"director\" and synched again and voila they are now in a named folder. but that may have been just because i synched it a 2nd time.\n", "Q: I forgot the Password for WPA/WPA2 Personal where can I get it I'am trying to set up a wireless connection to my HP OfficeJet printer.

Google Chrome is my default browser. I've restarted the machine twice since I confirmed that. \n\nA: Search with Google is a service provided by Safari and has nothing to do with Terminal.\nGoogle Chrome should provide its own service for this feature. It doesn't.\n\nOr you can write your own, e.g. using Automator and AppleScript:\nOpen Automator and select to create a new Service. At the top, select text and any application.

Sometimes on my macbook my wireless icon looks like this. \n\nIn the past I've only seen this when connecting to my iphone's hotspot, and I pressumed it was something along the lines of \"we're using bluetooth as well\" but when I took the screenshot I was connected to a normal everyday wireless access point.  What causes the change?\n\nA: That's clearly a tethering icon, so you have three options:\n\n\n*\n\n*your Mac OS is interpreting things incorrectly from the WiFi chipset (either due to needing a reboot or some systematic error)\n\n*the router is sending mixed signals\n\n*the hardware is detecting something that is not being sent (error or failure)\n\n", "Q: Sleep / hibernation logic on OS X I'm wondering what is a logic of sleep/hibernate of the OS X System. \nOn the lid closing MacBook should go to sleep - it is obvious but.. What if the machine is running only on batteries and it is in sleep mode for a long time (until complete discharge of the bateries). Does OS X will store RAM on disk to keep user work safe?\n\nA: It depends on how you have configured the hibernate bits in the power manager.\nSetting aside desktop machines which by default to not write anything to persistent storage when the system enters sleep, the default behavior is to write a copy of RAM to storage so that either power remains to wake the machine from RAM or the system will detect the sleep image and restore from that rather than booting from a clean state.\nYou can set more exotic combinations using pmset and a shell, but it is not officially \"supported\".\n", "Q: In apple mail, with contact photos enabled next to mail subjects, one person in my contact doesn't have his picture show up In Apple mail for OSX, I have pictures enabled for both the mail list view as well as in the message itself.

I'm trying to decide between purchasing a iPad mini or an iPad 4--this will be my first tablet.  I went to the Apple Store and was struck by how heavy the iPad 4 feels in comparison to the iPad mini, but also by how gorgeous the iPad 4 screen is.  The main question is if the weight and heft of the large iPad is worth the retina screen in comparison to the smaller, lighter, but not so crisp iPad mini.  My primary uses of the device will be ebooks, rss reading, document viewing, social networking, streaming video, light emailing, occasional gaming. \n\nA: No. Unless you are showing clients pictures or using a remote desktop access to control a computer and do work, the mini is so much lighter than the retina iPad that it's not even fair to compare them in terms of ease of use.\nYes, you can tell the difference between something drawn with retina versus the mini screen - especially for foreign texts and line art, but in practice it doesn't matter much.\nI have and use both and easily, my use slants 10 to 1 in favor of the lighter mini - especially for short bursts and casual reading and gaming. For several apps, I do increase the font size one notch from what I prefer on the retina display, but I don't find any critical failure in not having a retina display despite using the device heavily for work and pleasure.\nAt half the weight and almost all the power, the mini is the device to get except for some very specialized situations. You can also put the money you save into AppleCare plus or a wireless keyboard or just apps and have a better all around solution.\n\nA: It's really a personal thing, but I can offer my experiences.\nI love my retina iPad, I waited to get an iPad until the retina one came out and I'm glad I did. In comparison to the iPad 2 (which I got to use fairly extensively for a week or two), it's night and day for me, particularly for reading.\nThat said, the iPad Minis I've tested in stores have been very impressive — the form factor and especially the casing are great. If I hadn't been spoiled by the retina screen and was buying my first iPad, it would be a close call. However I think I would still go for the big iPad, for two reasons. Firstly, most of my use is either lounging on the couch or sitting with the iPad resting on a table, so the weight isn't as much of a concern for me. Secondly, so much of my use is for reading that the retina screen really makes a difference to me.\nMy best advice is to consider what your likely use is, and how much of a difference the weight will really make.\n", "Q: How can I make sure that all songs sync to my iPod? I have a 160GB iPod and it only syncs old music to my iPod. \nI buy new songs and it will not sync them. I have probably 150 songs that will not sync (purchased songs). I did run diagnostic and it says iTunes helper is not working. Not sure what that is and not sure if it has anything to do with it.\nHow can I fix so that all songs sync to my iPod?\n\nA: Make sure that in iTunes that you have it set to sync your \"Entire Music Library\":\n\n\n*\n\n*Open iTunes*\n\n*Connect your iPod\n\n*Select it in the iTunes sidebar\n\n*Click the \"Music\" tab\n\n*Ensure \"Sync Music\" is checked\n\n*Select \"Entire Music Library\"\n\n\n*This assumes you are running a fairly recent version of iTunes.\n\nA: Here is another answer, from Apple‘s support site: \nhttps://support.apple.com/en-au/HT201253\n", "Q: Will changing my Apple ID affect any apps that I have purchased?

I have a MacBook, an iPhone, and an iPad all using the same iCloud account to sync photos, among other things. There are photos on the iPhone in its Camera Roll, Photo Stream, the iPhoto app, and Camera+. On the iPad, there are a bunch of photos in iPhoto that I've processed and modified. \nAs a result, the two devices have already eaten the 5 GB of free space provided for iCloud backups. What is a safe and methodical workflow to get the photos off of the devices and into the Mac's iPhoto library without losing edits made on the iPad, and without duplicating a lot of photos?\n\nA: As an alternative to PhotoStream, I use PhotoSync to reliably move photos to my Mac without losses.  This is via wifi from PhotoSync on the iPad to the PhotoSync Companion on the Mac.  You will then need to import those photos into iPhoto on the Mac.\nWithout duplicates is bit harder.  PhotoSync will synchronise your photos without considering what you may have transferred using other methods (e.g. PhotoStream and iCloud).  So you will need to find duplicates yourself - either don't transfer those you already have in Mac iPhoto, or transfer the lot and sort out later on your Mac.\nRegarding a precise workflow, I suggest you play around with PhotoSync and then you will quickly develop a workflow which suits you.\n\nA: The Image Capture utility, available as part of Mac OS X in Applications or Launchpad, can detect images that you have already imported and display a green checkmark next to the thumbnail.  Unfortunately, it can only tell that you've already imported the photo if it resides in the same directory you're importing to.  It also supports importing into the iPhoto library, but it can't show duplicates there.\nI also will second that PhotoSync is a great app – it allows syncing on WiFi without connecting the USB cable, which is great for someone like me who uses all available USB ports on a regular basis.\n\nA: I would use Photostream to get all of the photo's off of your devices and onto your Mac as it will take care of the duplicate issues you are having.\nThe iPhone is already taken care of, as all of the camera roll photo's should be in your Photostream already. As for the iPad and your iPhoto modifications, you can use the iPhoto \"Edited\" album that the app has. This album contains every photo that you have modified in iPhoto. Open the iPad's iPhoto \"Edited\" album, turn on the thumbnail grid, select and hold a photo to enable multi-photo-select and then select all of the modified photos.\nOnce you have selected all of the modified photo's, use the Share button to send them to your iPad's camera roll. Photostream will then sync those photo's to your Mac's Photostream. No duplicate photo's.\nAlso, in the future, if you take pictures with your iPhone and they arrive in your iPad's Photostream, you can save them to your iPad Camera Roll and they do not get re-synced as a duplicate to Photostream. This lets you save local copies to each device's Camera Roll if you want and you don't have to worry about syncing duplicate's from Photostream to your Mac.\nHope this helps!\n\nA: To transfer photos from your iPad to computer, you need to have iTunes installed on your PC. \nConnect your iPad to the computer with the data cable. Launch iTunes, and click on the iPad icon from under Devices. Click on the Photos tab, and check the box \"Sync photos from.\" Click \"Choose folder\" from the drop-down menu, and select your picture folder. \nNow that the folder is on iTunes, you can select the photos you want to transfer to your iPad, or transfer them all. \nFinally, click the Sync/Apply button at the bottom right of the page. The pictures will transfer to your computer. Another option is to buy a photo transfer app for the iPad, which enables Wi-Fi photo transfers.\n", "Q: How to have a specific contact make a ring sound even in silent mode I have an iPhone 4, and I have the switch on the side set to switch silent mode on and off.\nI'd like specific contacts (for example, She Who Must Be Obeyed) to ring when they call, even in silent mode.\nI've seen various hacks on the internet suggesting using a \"silent\" ring tone, but that's not what I want. I basically want two states:\n\n\n*\n\n*All callers cause the phone to ring (according to their individual ring tone settings)\n\n*Almost all callers are silent except for VIPs\n\n\nIs this possible?\n\nA: This is an old post, but I came across it today looking for the same thing. For an iPhone 5c, running iOS 10.3.3, I found that going to Contacts' > 'NameOfContactYouWant > Edit > Ringtone (or Text Tone) > Emergency Bypass On will allow calls/texts to go through when the phone is otherwise silent.\n\nA: That's one of the benefits of the \"Do not disturb\" function in iOS 6:\n\n\n*\n\n*assign all contacts which can reach you even when you don't want to be disturbed int a contact group via iCloud\n\n*activate \"Do not disturb\" in Settings and configure the Notifications settings to still allow calls from the contact group you created. You can also schedule a time range when you want Do Not Disturb to automatically activate.\n\n*silence switch will still work as intended (silencing the phone)\n\n\nA: This is an old question but I stumbled on it when trying to find an answer for my iPhone 8.  There is now a real solution to this problem— edit the contact and turn “Emergency Bypass On”.  The text says it overrides Do Not Disturb, but I tested it and it overrides the silent switch too!\n\nA: One (painful) workaround is to give She Who Must Be Obayed access to your Apple ID so she can use Find iPhone to \"Play Sound\" if you don't answer your phone.  AFAIK that is the only Apple-approved way to play a sound on an iPhone while the phone is muted. \n\nA: Don't use the mute button. Instead, use the Do Not Disturb manual function in settings and select \"Allow calls from Favorites\". Open a contact and select the star from the bottom right to make it a favorite. \n\nA: What you are looking for is not possible with the defaults settings available to you.  The only way you can differentiate users is via the VIP, and so you need to do the workaround you suggested in order to only have a selection of users ring.\n\n\n*\n\n*Use a silent ringtone as default\n\n*Choose an actual ringtone for your VIP's\n\n\nOf course, the obvious drawback is that when not muted, your non-VIP contacts are still muted.  You can then perhaps further workaround this by setting a vibrate setting, and then setting vibrate when silent to off, which will mean that VIPs always ring, but non VIPs bibrate, or do nothing.\n\nA: If you're open to simply controlling who is allowed to cause your phone to ring (not necessarily dependent on whether or phone is on \"Silent\"), here are some options:\nOption 1: Use Do Not Disturb\nTurn on \"Do Not Disturb\" and set the \"Do Not Disturb\" settings to only \"Allow Calls From\" your \"Favorites\" (add/remove Favorites in the \"Phone\" app or directly on a contact in the \"Contacts\" app).\nNote: this will silence all other notifications, because \"Do Not Disturb\" will be active.\nMore info on The Verge.\n\nOption 2: Silence Unknown Callers\nAnother option is to silence all callers that are not in your contacts using \"Silence Unknown Callers\" in your \"Phone\" settings.\nMore info on CNET.\n\n\nPersonal Choice\nI always keep my phone on \"Do Not Disturb\" as I like to be in control of when I decide to look at my phone. I allow calls from \"All Contacts\", and make sure to add anyone that I expect calls from to my contacts. If I'm expecting a delivery or something, I'll temporarily turn off \"Do Not Disturb\". If I'm expecting unknown calls within a wide time range, I'll just allow all calls temporarily so that I can keep \"Do Not Disturb\" on.\n", "Q: Unable to restore applications after hard drive replacement My iMac 27\" went in for hard drive replacement but now I can't seem to get anything to restore. I've put Snow Leopard back onto the drive but then apps are missing and the second install disc that contains apps just ejects when I insert it.\nCould this be because because I'm downloading more up to date software than what Snow Leopard can accept? Should I upload software updates directly after installing Snow Leopard or should I install a new OS first? I paid for Lion ages ago so I could put that on.\n\nA: When you say \"cant get anything to restore\", do you mean \n\n\n*\n\n*you're having difficulty getting your data back onto your new drive?\n\n*You are having problems reinstalling software (either from the original install media or DMGs) you had before the drive swap?\n\n*Software from a TimeMachine backup is not running after you try and manually restore it back?\nNow that you have Snow Leopard installed, is this the same version of OS X you ran previously? If you did run 10.6, what update version did you run? 10.6.8? 10.6.7? Or, since you had paid for Lion \"ages ago\", was your iMac running 10.7?\nYour best bet is upgrading to and/or installing the version of OS X your iMac ran prior to the drive replacement. If this was Lion, you'll need to update to 10.6.8 first, then you can redownload Lion. \nOnce you have your OS back to parity, you should have an easier time reinstalling your software.\nOne other point to consider: if you are downloading current install files for the software you ran, you might not be finding the same version you ran. Newer versions of some programs may require Lion or later to run.\nGood luck!\n\nA: Lion doesn't bundle any iLife applications, so you will need to decide to dig into why the additional apps from Snow Leopard isn't working (perhaps a replacement disc is needed, or the install process was customized incorrectly to not install additional apps).\nWhat you describe should always work:\n\n\n*\n\n*Reinstall the OS from the original media\n\n*Reinstall additional apps from the original media\n\n*Then update everything to the latest version\n\n*Then restore your user files from a backup.\n\n\nIf you had a backup that contained users and apps, you could simply reinstall the OS you want to run and then migrate that backup and it should copy all apps and data in one step. You can also go to http://apple.com/support/manuals and look up the steps for reinstalling your Mac's OS since each reinstall disk is customized to a specific Mac the steps can vary from iMac to iMac.\n", "Q: The history is shared between my iTerm2 terminal tabs: how can I switch that off? I am using iTerm2 (with zsh), and for some reason the history is shared between the different tabs and windows that are open.

I would like to know how much power would a mac Mini consume per month/year if:\n\n\n*\n\n*always powered,  but under very low load web server\n\n*OS, probably Ubuntu\n\n*two drives: one SSD and one HD.\n\n*model Early 2010, Core duo 2\n\n\nI know that the manufacturer specification says it would consume between 11W-85W.\nHow can I convert this to Amps?\n\nA: If the idle power consumption was 11 W and the maximum was 85 W, the average might be something like 15 W if it's under very low load.\nThat would be about 500 MJ per year (15*86400*365).\nIf you paid 0.15 USD per kilowatt hour for electricity and the Mac mini was on all the time, it would cost about 20 USD per year (0.15*0.015*24*365).\n15 W is about 65 mA with 230 V (European) voltage and 125 mA with 120 V (North American) voltage.\n", "Q: Disable backspace to delete e-mails in Mail.app Sometimes I accidentally move messages to the trash in Mail.app when I hit backspace. I tried to find what the 'Backspace' shortcut stands for, but I could not find it in the Mail.app menu. The only thing I could find was Command-Backspace:\n\nI understand I can change shortcuts through System Preferences -> Keyboard -> Keyboard shortcuts, but since I can't find what Backspace does, I cannot disable it.\nMy questions are:\n\n\n*\n\n*How can I disable moving e-mails to trash with only 'Backspace'?\n\n*What does 'Backspace' do in Mail.app?\n\n*Why does this not show up in the menubar?\n\n\nI'm using Mail.app 5.3 on OS X 10.7.5 on a MacbookPro8,1.\n\nA: Actions performed by keys like delete (⌫; backspace on Windows) or return don't often have menu bar items. One reason might be that they are just so common and would clutter up the menu bar. The keys also have different functions in different contexts. If a menu item was assigned to delete, it would normally have precedence over the function delete has in text views.\nYou could use KeyRemap4MacBook to disable delete in Mail, but it would also disable it in text views.\n", "Q: Is it good to keep apps closed on iOS devices? Is it better to keep apps closed (double tap home button, hold the icon, and exit the app), as much as possible on iOS devices? I know the more apps one has open, the more RAM, for example is used, but would that same principle apply, in measurable effect, to iOS? \nFor example, would my iPhone (4S in this case), or iPad (3rd Gen) run any faster, or have longer battery life, or do better in any particular way if I had only 5 apps open, versus having 50 open?\nSide note: I know there are some apps that don't handle multi-tasking very well (possibly due to a lack of programming expertise?) and hence will deplete battery life while running in the background. I'm not necessarily talking about those.\n\nA: iOS at its core now has its own multitasking API built in. The only way for an app to even go into the background it has to use these API's, so even poor programming experience still can't ruin things too much (and, with the flip side of that, poor developer experience could make the app while its running use more resources than needed). \nAll in all - this shouldn't be an issue. Those apps in the tray don't mean they are running - it literally is also a recently used app tray. And again, the background tasks they can do are limited by the backgrounding API, so like audio, VOIP, navigation, uploads, etc. \nAs far as being faster, have longer battery life, etc - no. At least not on an average. You may feel that it runs different, and yes there may be a rouge app doing something odd,  and forcing it closed may help. \nBut in general, no - this shouldn't affect speed or battery life, unless those apps are currently doing background tasks such as location, audio, uploading files, etc. Otherwise, their RAM state is saved for quicker relaunch, but no processing power is being used.\n", "Q: How can I remove \"zombie entries\" from login items when the controls are dimmed? How can I get rid of zombie entries in Login items?\nIn this case BambooCore App doesn't respond to the - control even when I select it. Also the hide checkbox is disabled on this item, just like the delete control.\n\n\nA: It's far late, but I have discovered today, trying to remove a similar zombie item that you cannot remove items for ALL ITEMS when the padlock icon is closed. Open the padlock for any action that involves other users. That's all.\n\nA: The (All Users) is a clue that the system has been instructed to make all users have this item and it's not something you would add or remove from a user account.\nYou could browse to /Library/StartupItems and just remove the Bamboo (or potentially Wacom) items by moving them to trash or uninstalling the software that put those items on the system.\nTo be complete, if there are other users on the Mac, they may need to re-add that program if they want to use it. \n\nA: Seems you don’t have permission to remove this item — are you on a restricted account? You could try to launch System Preferences with sudo, and then try again. Open Terminal, then type this:  \nsudo open /Applications/System\\ Preferences.app/\nYou will have to enter your user password (which is not shown on screen).\nLet me know if this works!\n\nA: Other applications add login items to /Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginitems.plist.

I installed Windows on my Mac and Bootcamp installed NVidia Control Panel. Today I received a notification in the Control Panel about a new driver. \nShould I install it or should I wait for drivers from Apple? I mean, does it install the first basic drivers and then I'm free to install new drivers or is every new driver provided by Apple?\n\nA: Since you didn't mention you had a backup of the system or if you are equipped to troubleshoot a driver issue, you should probably not update things unless you have a problem.\nApple vets the drivers it provides to be sure they work well with Mac hardware - so although you are free to update drivers, you are skipping that vetting process. Unless the driver manufacturer messed up, you will should be as fine as any other user updating the driver so it's more an edge case of them not testing the new driver on Mac hardware than something that should break.\nApple's drivers are typically for the screen resolution, trackpad, system sensors and it's unlikely those need a change since your Mac hardware hasn't changed in most cases.\n\nA: For Macbooks with AMD cards, note that AMD has a dedicated page with drivers designed for Macbooks running Boot Camp: http://support.amd.com/en-us/download/desktop/bootcamp\nThe version on that page matches the version I got in my initial Windows 10 install, which I haven't updated since (15.301). The AMD program on my computer is offering to upgrade me to 16.50, but I'm not going to do that unless I have problems.\nStill, it's nice to know that you can download the Boot Camp version again if you try to upgrade and it doesn't go well (assuming you can still see anything ;) ).\n", "Q: Are my frequent Safari beach balls caused by my extensions? Every 2-10 minutes Safari pauses with a spinning beach ball for roughly 10-90 seconds, sometimes asking if I want to reload everything, making Safari almost unusable.\nI've installed several safari extensions that mess with pages to prevent cross site attacks, scripting, cookies, etc.  In particular, my active extensions are : AdBlock, ClickToFlash, Ghostery, JavaScript Blocker, and JavaScript BlackList.  Anyone experienced conflicts amongst these before?\nAdditionally, I've installed but disabled Disconnect, NinjaKit, and WasteNoTime, but presumably disabled extensions cannot contribute to the problem. \nI'll experiment with disabling these active scripts piecemeal, starting with JavaScript BlackList, who's role is presumably superseded by Ghostery and JavaScript Blocker.  \nI'm especially curious about whether Ghostery and JavaScript Blocker might be conflicting, given that they do very similar page editing.  I prefer JavaScript Blocker for being infinitely more aggressive than Ghostery, but Ghostery has a better curated block list, which helps me allow stuff through JavaScript Blocker.\n\nA: I'd say it's definitely possible, if not likely.\nFor starters, turn off extensions altogether, to verify that they're causing the issues. Then I'd suggest disabling them one at a time (which sounds like you've tried partly), until you can isolate which one is causing the issues.\nIf that doesn't help (but all extensions off does), then try only one of your Javascript blockers at once, in the event that some conflict between them is causing problems.\n\nA: I've found that Chrome avoids this performance pitfall of Safari, well I needed one browsers with security extensions working while temporarily disabling extensions in Safari.  \nI suspect that Chrome performs better because Chrome sandboxes each tab separately. There are arguments that Chrome's V8 JS engine provides more stability anyways, in particular V8 is commonly used in server side JS, but whatever. \nIn any case, all this careful sandboxing makes Chrome much more secure than Safari in the first place, so anyone with these concerns should simply run Chrome. \nAt present, I found weak evidence that disabling all extensions fixes this problem, but disabling any individual extensions does not.  I therefore suspect that Safari does not fully disabled extensions when individually disabling them, perhaps an extension I never enable causes the problem. \nAlso, I've weak evidence that Chrome loads pages slightly slower than Safari, not sure if that's the sandboxing and/or my extensions, but any such tiny page load hit is nothing compared to Safari's frequent paralyzing long freezes.\n\nA: I only use Safari to log into other Google Accounts, so its a vanilla installation, with no extensions and pretty much default settings. My system is all up to date. Even with just GMail and a couple of websites open, Safari frequently locks up for a few seconds, sometimes longer.\nI'm using a (mid 2013) MacBook Air 13. FireFox and Chrome are both fast and stable, even with extensions injecting CSS and JavaScript etc., and other applications are all responsive. It's just whenever Safari gets focus.\nSafari must work well for most users, as it doesn't have too bad a reputation as a browser, but my personal experience has been similar to Jeff Burdges'.\n", "Q: Can I download iphone apps from the online iTunes without having access to the iTunes program?

Or maybe not download them, but earmark them in my account to download later?\n\nA: You can't buy without iTunes or an iOS device.\nYou can borrow someone else's device (iOS or computer) and sign in with your account to do the buying and then cancel the download / delete the app.\nYou could also gift them to yourself, but that is a bit more work and doesn't save you from getting to the point where you would just buy the apps.\nAs a last resort, you could call a friend and have them gift it to you and pay them later.\n", "Q: How to take care of an iPod touch with a broken screen? I have a 4th gen iPod touch that recently managed to escape my hand and embrace the floor. While the situation was rather comical, now the glass screen is broken. Everything else works fine, including the touchscreen, but it has the so-called \"Spiderman\" cracks all over half the screen.\nI've called Apple to see if they'll fix it, but it's too expensive, so I'm not going to do it. I also don't think I'd trust myself or an unofficial repair shop to do it. So my question is, what can I do to prevent further cracking? There are some places where it looks like pieces of glass could fall off easily. Is there any way to protect what's left of it while making sure the touch sensitivity still works on the whole screen?\n\nA: Unless you are going to never flex the device, you'll want a clear adhesive cover or clear tape to prevent the glass from easily falling out and cutting your fingers or lying in wait in a pocket or bag.\nSomething like a Otterbox case with a more substantial plastic barrier might be appropriate (or even both clear tape and a thicker plastic sleeve depending on how likely the glass is to fall out.\nIf you run your finger nail lightly over the surface, you should be able to tell if the underlying layers are cracked or if the surface digitizer layer is cracked and proceed appropriately.\nIn cases where the digitizer is intact, I have known people to baby a phone for 6 or more months without any glass pieces falling out, so it really depends on how bad your drop was.\n\nA: it works really well if you just put clear boxing tape on it\n", "Q: Where the ambient temperature sensor is located on 27\" iMacs?

I just got a 2TB external hard drive, and I want to use it to backup my 3 Windows computers and my MacBook Pro. If possible, I would like to create 4 subdirectories on the external drive - one subdirectory for each computer. Can I tell Time Machine to put my MacBook Pro backups into one subdirectory, so that it doesn't affect any of the other stuff on the external drive? \nBTW, I will be installing one of those NTFS drivers for the Mac OS X, so that it can write files to the NTFS-formatted external drive.\n\nA: Your preferred setup is not possible: OS X can't share an NTFS disk with Windows for backup because Time Machine needs HFS+ (from http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1427):\n\nManually preparing a new disk for Time Machine\n(...) \nIf you want to partition the disk, click the Partition tab and\n  select a layout.

Using partitioning you can trick your computer into thinking it is connected to more than one drive, although there's only one. In this case, two partitions will suffice, one HFS+ and one NTFS.\n(Why only one NTFS partition although you back up 3 Windows computers? Because Windows stores backups in folders named after the computer name  so there are no conflicts whatsoever (see this post). You can use one NTFS partition to store backups of multiple Windows computers.)\nI'd recommend that you create the HFS+ partition on your Mac first, then, on your Windows computer, format the other partition to NTFS:\n\n\n*\n\n*Plug your drive into your Mac.\n\n*Open Disk Utility (in Applications/Utilities).\n\n*Select the drive and select the Partition tab.\n\n*Create two partitions.

See  here for more details.\n\n*Eject the drive and plug it into your Windows computer.\n\n*Format the second partition as NTFS.\n\n\nWhen you're done, plug the drive again into every Mac/Windows computer and select the corresponding partition as backup drive (see here for OS X and here for Windows).\nTo prevent the NTFS partition from being mounted every time you connect the drive into your Mac add this entry to /etc/fstab (as explained here):\nLABEL=BACKUP_WINDOWS none fusefs_txantfs noauto \n\nReplace BACKUP_WINDOWS with the NTFS partition name.\nThis setup works like a charm.\nI have a very similar configuration:\nMy external 1 TB drive, which I use for backing up my Mac and my wife's Windows PC, has two partitions called \"Time Machine\" and \"BACKUP_WINDOWS\":\n\n\nA: Yes, you can use a single NTFS disk for both Windows and Mac backups.\nTime Machine can work on 'foreign' drives fine by using a sparsebundle disk image. This is how TM works with a networked drive; it creates a sparsebundle on the network drive, and then mounts it.\nThere are a 3 main steps to using an NTFS or other non-HFS+ drive for Time Machine:\n\n\n*\n\n*Get a read/write NTFS driver. Paid ones are Tuxera and Paragon, free\nis OSXFuse with NTFS-3G. Or, as per @Maneko's comment, you can use exFat instead of NTFS.\n\n*Create a sparsebundle disk image. TimeMachine makes two demands of this sparsebundle: it must be named after your machine, and it must contain a specific .plist file. You can get a commandline script off the interwebs which does this step for you.\n\n*Copy the new sparsebundle image to your external drive. However large the sparsebundle you specified, it will only be a couple of MB big at this point. That's the magic of sparsebundles.\n\n*Mount the sparsebundle diskimage by double-clicking it, and then tell Time Machine to use it.\nThere's more detailed instructions on http://www.cafe-encounter.net/p1847/use-a-windows-ntfs-or-linux-or-other-formatted-disk-for-apple-time-machine-backups.\nCaveats: You must double-click the sparsebundle to re-mount the backup drive each time you disconnect/reconnect the drive or re-boot the Mac. And I found it slow. Maybe because my Windows drive was a USB2 connection. YMMV.\n", "Q: Will I able to share my internet connection using my MBP's airport if I am connected to the internet through an external USB Wireless adapter? I know that I can share my internet connection with other devices using my MacBook Pro's Airport as long as I'm using ethernet (wired) for my connection to the internet. But if I'm using the airport for the internet connection itself, that option to share it goes away.  I'm considering getting a high-powered Hawking USB wireless adapter to use at my cabin in order to be able to get a wireless signal from my uncle next door (with permission, of course) since a built-in wireless card isn't quite powerful enough to pick it up.   \nWill I able to then share my internet connection with other wireless devices using my MacBook's Airport similarly to sharing a wired internet connection, considering that I'm not using the airport for the connection itself, but am using the USB adapter?  \n\nA: Yes - Macs have internet sharing where you can use one device to get internet and share it from another.\nMost people in a cabin situation set up an AirPort to let all the devices talk and then you would share from the USB to the physical ethernet port. The router would get to the internet from the ethernet and everyone can join the WiFi and share whether or not the USB modem is dialed.\nYou would set the service order to have the USB modem be the highest connection in the network pane.\nWhat you ask is also possible - just share from USB to WiFi and the Mac will create a wireless network the other devices can join.\n\nA: Yes,\nAirport USED to be the name for the chip itself, now however it is the entire technology as a whole. \n", "Q: 2560x1440 resolution in linux vm with virtualbox or vmware I've got a macbook air (10.8.2) and want to use an external monitor with 2560x1440 resolution with a Linux (Debian) virtual machine. I want to use the vm in fullscreen mode, with 2560x1440 resolution. Will that work in virtualbox or vmware? \n\nA: Yes; I confirm Debian runs Full Screen under VMWare on Lion at 2560x1440.\n\n", "Q: Restore user data, settings and apps from hard-drive copy Here's the situation:\n\n\n*\n\n*My GF's MacBook Pro broke, OS would not start at all\n\n*I inserted Knoppix Live CD, booted and just copied all of the files from her HD to folder on  external HD\n\n*I've reinstalled OS on MacBook pro\n\n\nMy questions is: how can I easily restore all of her settings from HD to new OS installation and user account? Will simple copying files do the job? And what kind of software you recommend for backups? \nI'm coming from *NIX / PC background, and new to Mac OS X, so wanted make sure before proceeding.\n\nA: When you say settings what do you mean?  \nWhat current version of MAC os will you be restoring too?\nMigration Assistant will allow you to restore from an external drive, if the drive has been formatted in the OS X Journaled format with the proper GUID.\n", "Q: \"No Bootable Device\" after failed Boot Camp installation (Windows 8 - 1TB Fusion Drive) On my new iMac /w a 1TB Fusion Drive, I tried to install Windows 8 (still technically unsupported) using the following method:\nhttp://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2012/11/no-support-no-problem-inst alling-windows-8-on-a-mac-with-boot-camp/\nEverything was proceeding just fine; I had Boot Camp copy all of the Windows 8 files (a legitimate, store-bought copy) to a bootable USB drive - a feature only available on new Macs running Boot Camp Assistant that don't come with an internal optical drive - and create a 102 Gb partition on the Fusion Drive. It then rebooted and was proceeding through the Windows 8 setup wizard as should be expected, but it couldn't modify any of the partitions on the Fusion Drive and wouldn't proceed. I accepted defeat and decided I would just wait until Windows 8 is officially supported before trying again.\nNow, every time I turn the computer on, I get an error message saying \"No Bootable Device...\", unless I hold down the Option key and manually select \"Macintosh HD\" (the only boot device listed). I already removed the primary Windows 8 partition, but it hasn't fixed the issue.\nI'm thinking that it's one of the 'hidden' partitions causing it to behave like this, or something wrong with the EFI bootloader, but I don't know how to proceed. Any thoughts on this?\n\nA: I had a similar issue installing Windows 8 x64 on a 2013 Macbook Pro Retina running Mac OS 10.8.3 (which does support Windows 8) and the problem turned out to be an issue between the 32GB USB 3.0 installer drive I was using and Bootcamp Assistant/Mac OS. The USB drive was not defective.\nI went through the Boot Camp Assistant process three times using a Microcenter branded 32GB USB 3.0 thumb-drive. When the system would reboot to start the Windows 8 installation process I would get a \"No Bootable Device\" error. After reading a suggesstion from another site I changed USB drives and used a Microcenter branded 16GB USB 2.0 thumb-drive and the Windows 8 installer USB was found and installation proceeded successfully.\n\nA: Go to system preferences then startup disk. Then select Mac OS X and hit restart. \n\nA: Ok, so the first thing I should have tried resolved the issue: I just needed to repair the fusion drive in Disk Utility. Didn't even need to do it from a recovery partition - it updated all of the boot preferences perfectly.\n...and now just to play the waiting game until Boot Camp Assistant finally functions properly with Windows 8. :P\n", "Q: Rename file to match containing folder's name I have a collection of image files grouped into folders named Project_01, Project_02, etc. Using Automator, I have composed a workflow that asks the user for a folder, and combines the images in that folder into a single PDF document. The destination folder for the output PDF file can be determined with a variable; however, the file name field of the action expects a constant string. \nIs there any way, maybe through renaming, that I can Automator have the output file give the name of the containing folder, e.g. Project_01.pdf?\n\nA: If you already have a variable with the name you want, the easiest way would be to add a Rename Finder Items action after the PDF is created. Set it to Name Single Item, and you can just drag in the variable as the new name.\n\n", "Q: Pros & Cons of still running Mac OS X Snow Leopard? I am still running Snow Leopard on my late 2010 Macbook Pro. Are there potentially any benefits of still using this version of the Mac OS, or am I more disadvantaged by not being on the latest version - Mountain Lion.\nSome people have informed me that Mountain Lion is very iOS-eque in nature, and they feel that this really should be kept to iOS devices such as the iPhone & iPad, and not brought into the \"computing environment\", such is the case that if they were able to downgrade to Snow Leopard they would - however they inform me that their brand new iMacs are of an \"architecture\" that does not permit this.\nAnother person informed me that security updates for Snow Leopard ended some months ago, and it is now officially an unsupported OS (although I dont believe this to be the case), thus Lion is now the oldest supported OS. \nAny clarification on the above is very welcomed........\n\nA: Pros:\n1) Speed. 10.6.x runs faster on older hardware, particularly if you only have a regular hard drive. I see the beachball much more often in Mountain Lion than I did in Snow Leopard because my MBPro only has a 5400-RPM drive and ML seems to access the hard disk a lot more. SSD is preferred for Lion and Mountain Lion.\n2) Colored icons in the Finder sidebar. Apple made them grayscale in 10.7 and 10.8, a huge step back for usability. There is a hack that will re-enable color, but it can cause Finder instability.\n3) Rosetta. If you upgrade to 10.7/10.8, you'll lose the ability to run apps based on PPC code.\nCons:\n1) No iCloud. There are workarounds but I've never been able to get them to work properly or reliably.\n2) Security updates. However, you can \"stay safe\" just by keeping Flash up-to-date (or uninstall it and only use Chrome for Flash), disabling Java in your web browsers, avoiding pirated software, running Little Snitch, and periodically running AV software.\nThese are the ones that stand out to me. I'm sure others can add to this list. \n\nA: I'm currently dual booting Snow Leopard and Mountain Lion.  I have the latter strictly for iOS 6 and iPhone 5 emulators.  I'm disappointed in Apple.  ML is too much like the iOS.  They threw away Spaces and Expose for Mission Control.  You can no longer customize your spaces in an easy manner without downloading a third party software and it is way too slow.  I have an early 2011 Macbook Pro instead of a 2012 because the new ones won't natively run SL.  They seem to be taking the Microsoft route with that.  I understand the lack of certain features on older OS's but not allowing them to be installed is just horrendous. \nI say all this because there are issues dual booting.  My SL install has been having issues and I've need to Safe Boot a couple of times.  To do this I have to boot ML and specify the SL partition as my boot device otherwise it just boots to Safe Boot in ML.  I've tried specifying this within SL but it's somehow getting ignored.  It's annoying.  I've also had to add a partition to use files across the two.  If you choose the dual boot route I highly recommend it to avoid permissions conflicts and storing/maintaining two copies of the same file.\nI'm going to try to use ML from an external but I fear that will be entirely too slow with the way it bogs down running from the internal.  If their next release doesn't blow me away I plan on getting a PC and running Linux.\n", "Q: Moving External Boot Drive into Mac mini (Mid 2007) Some time ago the hard disk inside of my family's Mac mini (Mid 2007) failed. We purchased an external disk (Some iteration of the Western Digital 'My Passport'), installed OS X onto it, and have been using it as the boot volume through USB. The computer has been running fine, albeit very slowly, though the computer now needs to be used more intensively and the bottleneck of a USB boot drive has made it impossible to do so.\nSo I ask you this: Will I need to format the disk once it's in the mini and reinstall OS X? Or will I just be able to place the My Passport's drive into the mini, select the now-internal drive as the boot volume and be alright?\n\nA: Assuming the drive inside the My Passport has a SATA connection, then you can just take the drive as-is without any need for re-formatting or changing any data.\nHowever you should look into the specific model of drive you've got — some external drives are manufactured with direct USB interfaces to save costs, rather than a SATA interface with a USB bridge.\n", "Q: Is there any way to get rid of the gray area in iCal? The gray area I'm referring to is the area that's not used, say from 12am to 6am. \nI want to get rid of this area entirely (It's not the color that's the issue). I don't use that space at all, so it means I have to scroll down to schedule something every single time -- seems very counter-intuitive imho.\nEdit: Simplified to one question.\nEdit: Still no solution, but some workarounds are provided below. An actual solution would be best though. (Not to take anything away from those who contributed).\n\nA: I can answer 1. Go to preferences in iCal, and set \"day starts at\" to midnight, and \"day ends at\" to midnight. Or... whenever you want the grey area not to go. So 8-6 (default I think) will make 8-6 not grey. Here's a screen scrape of how that looks:\n\n\nA: Follow @lemontwist's directions to set the day start and end times to just the hours that you want to see. Then change the \"Show [X] hours at a time\" to that number of hours. You'll have to scroll the view into place once, but then it seems like it sticks there.\nFor example, if you set the day to start at 8:00 and end at 6:00, then set it to show 10 hours at a time and scroll the view down to 8:00. The visible area will then cover 8:00 to 6:00 and you shouldn't have to adjust it again.\n", "Q: Ways to retrive deleted iMessages on iPhone This may be a popular question, but I have not seen a very satisfying answer for it. It is unfortunate when one accidentally deletes iMessages because all of the history of that message is gone, and there appears to be no way to get it back on the device itself. \nAre there existing apps that would recover messages onto the device?\n\nA: I am not aware of apps that can recover messages from your iPhone. If you accidentally deleted messages off your iPhone, you would need to restore the iPhone from your most recent iCloud or iTunes backup.\nThe restore will bring back all the SMS/iMessages that were present on your iPhone at the time of the backup itself. \n\nA: You have two options to be able to access those deleted iMessages\n\n\n*\n\n*If you have a mac computer with the Messages application set up, you can view the messages in that app after deleting them from your phone. This will only work for iMessages and not text messages.\n\n*You can restore your iPhone to a previous iCloud or iTunes backup to view the messages on your phone again.\n\n", "Q: How do I get Siri to ignore a particular contact that shares someone else's name? I have two people in my contacts with the same first name (let's call them John). One person, John Appleseed, I talk to all the time. The other one, John Doe, I haven't spoken to in years.\nWhen I tell Siri something like \"Where is John?\" or \"Text John What's up?\", I'm frequently asked \"Which one? John Appleseed, or John Doe?\"\nOther than deleting the unfortunate person who shares the same first name as someone I talk to all the time, how can I teach Siri that \"John\" always refers to John Appleseed?\n\nA: Try giving the contact a nickname (Add Field > Nickname) in your Contacts, and then use that nickname when ordering Siri to text that person. Alternatively, put a character in front of old John's name so Siri never gets confused (e.g., xJohn or oldJohn or #John).\n", "Q: Notes - Setting up for use with iCloud Why do I have to enable 'Notes' in both \"Settings > iCloud > Notes\" and also in \"Mail, Contacts, Calendar\" > [iCloud account name] > \"Notes\"?\nIf I do not set both of these 'Notes' to 'On', the iCloud Notes account does not appear in Notes.app > \"Accounts\".  I just have \"On my iPhone\".\nHowever, if I do set both to 'On', then I have 2 Notes accounts under iCloud.\nWhy can't I set just one? Why do I have to set the second one?\n\nA: What is interesting, is that both of the places you mentioned are redundant. You cannot have \"Mail, Contacts, Calendars\" > [iCloud name] > \"Notes\", Off, while \"iCloud\" > \"Notes\" is On. If one is on, and you have an @icloud.com (or @mac.com style), the other will automatically be in agreement. \nSo in short, set one, and other will be set.\nThis is probably because, Apple provides Settings.app > iCloud for users who haven't chosen to set up an @icloud.com (or equivalent) email address. For users who have chosen to set up that email, the settings become redundant. \n\nOther email accounts under \"Mail, Contacts, Calendars\" may have the option of notes, in which case it syncs notes you create in the Notes.app with your email accounts (often found under \"Notes\" somewhere).\n\nA: Another thing to note is that you cannot sync notes from your \"On My iPhone\" account to iCloud.  I thought all of my Notes were automatically backed up in the cloud once I turned on iCloud sync.\nIn fact there seems no other way to backup iPhone notes located on your \"On My iPhone\" account than to use standalone, non-Apple backup iPhone notes utilities.\nI would always advise to make sure your iCloud Notes sync is enabled before you start taking notes on your iPhone or iPad as there is no way to back them up or sync the notes you have created prior to enabling the iCloud.\nFinally, both sets of options under Settings > iCloud > Notes and under Settings > Mail, Contactrs, Calendars > iCloud Account > Notes are identical provided you use one and the same iCloud account. Note that if you use more than one iCloud account, and enable Notes sync under both accounts, there is indeed a possibility that two \"iCloud\" accounts appear in your Notes account.\n", "Q: SSD Sleep or Shut Down? I have a MacBook Pro with SSD drive.  I am concerned that leaving it on (closing the lid when not in use) will wear out the SSD drive quicker than fully shutting the system off.  The boot up time is really not too big of a deal considering that when I'm away from the computer it's usually for many hours at a time. The way it is right now the unit is up instantly when I turn on the power button.\nWhich mode will best prolong the life of the SSD drive?\n\nA: Unless you do some serious data crunching with your Mac, you shouldn't need to worry about SSD wear. It does happen, but any relatively recent SSD does a lot to combat it, both by minimizing write amplification, and by setting aside spare area to do wear levelling and compensate for bad flash.\nIf you're really worried about it, you can still sleep, but not use hibernate mode, meaning that nothing gets written to disk. Just open Terminal and run sudo pmset hibernatemode 0. You can then delete the sleep file to free up some space: sudo rm -rf /var/vm/sleepimage.\n", "Q: PhotoStream on iPhoto-MacBook is different from PhotoStream-iPad I see so many pictures that I have took with iPhone on iPad Photo Stream.\nBut today I also wanted to activate PhotoStream on iPhoto on MacBook. So did I ! but the images it has downloaded are just around 20 photos, there are so much more if I go to PhotoStream on iPad or iPhone but on PhotoStream on MacBook there is just a few of them.\nShouldn't they all show the same thing?\n\nA: Apple has a fairly comprehensive troubleshooting article for isolating any inconsistencies like you have observed and clearly, the design of Photo Stream is that there is one set of pictures available from the cloud (the web  interface) as well as each device that has the stream enabled.\n\n\n*\n\n*TS3989 - iCloud: Photo Stream troubleshooting\nWhy not work your way through that document and then ask a second question if needed if you run into problems on a specific step?

I have this Twitter application that shows on my Mountain Lion available updates list but I don't have any twitter app on my Mac. I had, but I have deleted it times ago.\nSince then, every time twitter updates their app, I receive a notification that a new update is available.\nHow do I get rid of this ghost app update entry that haunts updates list in the App Store app?\n\n\nA: In almost all cases, this is one of two things:\n\n\n*\n\n*somewhere on your Mac, an older copy of the App is lying around and in need of an update (even though the version in /Applications is up to date)\n\n*spotlight is messed up\n\n\nThe first is much easier to fix, so eject all disks and network volumes and then quit and re-launch the App Store. If you still show an update, check for other copies of that app using spotlight. \nOnce you are sure it's not a case of more than one app, you can go down the more complicated path of spotlight triage/repair. I like to add all drives to spotlight’s privacy pane and delete all copies of the problem app and reboot. Then turn on spotlight for just the boot volume. \nOnce spotlight is done indexing that drive, go reinstall the problem app. If things are clear, enable spotlight on all remaining volumes. If not, we can cover that bigger spotlight issue in a different thread. \n", "Q: Preventing iPhone 3GS from auto-updating to iOS 6 I don't want to update my iPhone 3GS from iOS 5 to iOS 6. I think this happens automatically via WiFi update. How do I stop it from downloading and installing itself?\n\nA: Fortunately for you, iOS will not update without your consent. You have to physically go in and choose to Download, and Install the Update (two steps) in order for it to update to the next version of iOS.\niOS 5 or higher have a feature called OTA (Over the Air) updates, which bring the convenience of not having to plug your iPhone into iTunes to update it - which you are aware of. It displays a badge on the Settings app on iPhone homescreen, but this will still not update without your consent (unlike some Windows OS updates).\nUnfortunately, the Settings.app is not in the list of notifications that you have control.  So you will have to get used to seeing the \"1\" on the Settings.app.\nYou will also have to be careful to decline (skip) updating your device anytime you plug it in via USB to iTunes. One thing to note, is that you don't have to worry about Wifi syncing with your device. It will not update your device using iTunes Wifi sync. \n\nA: To prevent an update, don't start the download and/or don't install it once it downloads. \n\n\n*\n\n*iOS: How to update your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch\nAlso, don't download the update using iTunes or let it get downloaded / applied when you connect or restore the device in iTunes.

After storing data on a Fusion Drive, is it possible to downgrade your Mac to use the hard drive (HDD) by just removing the solid state drive (SSD)?\nIn particular, I was wondering what happens when the SSD fails for one reason or another. Under the hood, is a Fusion Drive's SSD just a clone of operating, system, applications and most used files? If so, are all files safe on the old HDD and can it still boot? Or do I need to format the HDD and reinstall operating system, every application and move files back to HDD?\n\nA: The Fusion drive is an amalgam of the SSD and HDD. If either piece gets removed or fails, you lose all the data. It might be possible to retrieve some of it, but it would be a job for drive recovery experts.\nIf you have a Fusion drive, it is possible to split it into the two separate pieces, resulting in a standard two-drive setup. However this is a destructive process, you need to reinstall the OS and all your data afterwards, as well as the recovery partition. On Macs that came with a pre-installed Fusion drive, you'll also run into issues where Disk Utility wants to \"fix\" the Fusion drive, so disk management needs to be done with the command line tools.\nIf you really want to split your Fusion drive, make sure you have a backup — this will delete your data; then boot into the Recovery partition (⌘R on boot) and open Terminal.\nRun diskutil coreStorage list, and note the long string that appears after Logical Volume Group — that's the UUID. Then run diskutil coreStorage delete UUID, replacing UUID with the actual string. You can then reinstall OS X on the SSD or HDD and restore from a backup.\n\nA: According to Anandtech's article Understanding Apple's Fusion Drive:\n\nTotal volume size is the sum of both parts. In the case of the 128GB + 1TB option, the total available storage is ~1.1TB. The same is true for the 128GB + 3TB option (~3.1TB total storage).\n\nIf the total size of the storage is the size of the SSD plus the size of the HD, then the HD alone cannot hold all the data in the fusion drive. Therefore, if you remove the SSD then you won't be able to continue to operate with just the HD.\n\nA: If the SSD fails, the OS won't show you any files and you would need to send both drives to a recovery specialist and expect to get few to some files (and many fragments of files) back. Since the tiered storage moves parts of files to the HDD, there is no guarantee the entire copy of a file will exist on either drive for recovery.\nClearly a mostly full to the brim \"Fusion Drive\" will have many entire files moved to the HDD, but sadly, the things you use most are most likely to have some parts still on the SSD.\n\nYou could swap a new drive in for the SSD and reconfigure the core storage (reformat the Fusion Drive) and restore from a backup (or not swap a new drive in but still reconfigure core storage and restore from a backup). \nJust like losing a drive from a RAID 1 stripe, you lose all data when Disk Utility \"fixes\" a broken Fusion Drive. Having a full and up to date backup is extremely important for users of Fusion Drive.\n", "Q: Installing Xcode via command line I am a Linux user and have never used OSX before. Someone asked me for help with installing some software on an OSX \"Lion\" server. I asked him to give me an SSH shell, assuming that would be sufficient. However things are more tricky than I thought.\nI wanted to install homebrew, but it didn't install because there was no cc on the system. After some google, I suppose I need to install Xcode.

You can get it from Apple's Developer Downloads (which requires a free developer account). Unfortunately there's no direct link, but just search for command line tools and you'll find it (note that there are different downloads for Lion and Mountain Lion).\nThe download is a DMG. Mount that, and you'll find a .mpkg file, which you can install via the command line: sudo installer -pkg \"Command Line Tools.mpkg\" -target /.\n\nA: The tools you need are all in Xcode.app/Contents/Developer and if you have that folder, you are done installing since OS X applications can run from anywhere.\nIf you want to use Xcode, just click on the icon or open -a the path to the folder Xcode.app and you will launch the app. Most people move the Xcode.app folder into /Applications (or ~/Applications) to \"install it\"\nOh - when you fire up Xcode you will want to open the preferences, go to the Downloads pane and install the stand alone command line tools. This places the compilation toolchain in /usr/bin so you don't have to use xcrun --find gcc and xcrun --find make to locate the path to the tools relative to wherever you dropped the Xcode.app folder.\n\nA: I recently had to install Xcode command line tools on Mountain Lion over SSH. Here's how I did it.\n\n\n*\n\n*If you don't have a free Apple developer account, register for one\n\n*Login to https://developer.apple.com/downloads\n\n*Download the \"Command Line Tools for Xcode\" appropriate for your version of OSX\nFor me, that was \"Command Line Tools (OS X Mountain Lion) for Xcode - April 2014\"\n\n*Copy the dmg file to your remote\nIn the following command, I'm using scp to securely copy the file from my local computer to the remote named remote\n$ scp ~/Downloads/command_line_tools_for_osx_mountain_lion_april_2014.dmg remote:Downloads/\n\n\n*ssh to your remote\n$ ssh remote\n\n\n*mount the dmg file on the remote\nHere, I'm using hdiutil to mount the image\n$ hdiutil attach ~/Downloads/command_line_tools_for_osx_mountain_lion_april_2014.dmg\n\n\n*install the package contained in the dmg\nHere, installer must be run with sudo because this package needs to be installed on the root file system \n$ cd /Volumes/Command\\ Line\\ Tools\\ \\(Mountain\\ Lion\\)\n$ sudo installer -pkg Command\\ Line\\ Tools\\ \\(Mountain\\ Lion\\).mpkg -target /\n\n\n*unmount the dmg file\n$ hdiutil detach /Volumes/Command\\ Line\\ Tools\\ \\(Mountain\\ Lion\\)\n\n\n*delete the dmg file from the remote; optional\nI see no purpose keeping it around, but you can if you want.\n$ rm ~/Downloads/command_line_tools_for_osx_mountain_lion_april_2014.dmg\n\n\nA: This is pretty old, but for anyone who comes by this, there is a simple, built-in, one-liner to install the Command Line Tools without the need to download any .dmg or .pkgs. This is available even on a fresh install of macOS.\nThe command is:\nxcode-select --install\n\nAccording to the man page:\nOpens a user interface dialog to request automatic installation of the command line developer tools.\n\nIt seems to have been available since Xcode 3.0 was around (OS X 10.5).\n\nA: MOUNT XCODE DMG\ntell application \"Finder\" to open (\"Macintosh HD\")\ntell application \"Finder\"\n    activate\n    set target of Finder window 1 to folder \"Downloads\" of folder \"vagrant\" of folder \"Users\" of startup disk\n    open document file \"{{ osx_xcode_file }}\" of folder \"Downloads\" of folder \"vagrant\" of folder \"Users\" of startup disk\nend tell\n\nReplace Xcode \"{{ osx_xcode_file }}\" with the version/filename you have downloaded.\nInstall XCODE\ntell application \"Finder\"\n    activate \"Xcode\"\n    with timeout of 1000000 seconds\n        copy file \"Xcode:Xcode.app\" to folder \"Macintosh HD:Applications\"\n    end timeout\nend tell\n\nOptionally Delete a previous XCODE\nrm /Applications/Xcode.app causes unforsean issues\ntell application \"Finder\"\n    activate \"Applications\"\n    considering case\n        with timeout of 1000000 seconds\n            set sourceFolder to POSIX file \"/Applications/Xcode.app\"\n            try\n                delete sourceFolder\n            on error errorMessage number errorNumber\n                set _error to errorMessage\n                set _errorNum to errorNumber\n            end try\n        end timeout\n    end considering\nend tell\n\nSave each file as an scriptname.scpt\nrun: /usr/bin/osascript scriptname.scpt\nRun as a console user (NOT ROOT)\n", "Q: Access to time capsule from main router? I'm currently having a Linksys router which gets an IP from my ISP. I have 2 Macbooks which are getting a DHCP lease from this router.\nWhen I connect a Time Capsule to the router, the Time Capsule will get an IP from my router, which will be in the same subnet of my Macbooks.\nMy questions:\n(a) will I be able to use Time Machine to backup my 2 Macbooks to the Time Capsule?\n(b) will I be able to access a Time Capsule sure from a Windows laptop which is in the same subnet of the Macbooks/Time Capsule?\n\nA: Yes - once you have things set up - Windows, iOS and Mac will all see the Time Capsule even when it's not running the network and your router still handles routing.\nOf course it depends on how you set up the Time Capsule since out of the box, it will want to be a router and you could hook things up in a troublesome manner unintentionally. The time capsule has a firewalled connection (The WAN port) that if you use, you have to tear down several settings to allow someone from \"outside\" the network to see the drive. The Time Capsule has several internal ethernet ports as well as potentially joining the network over WiFi which wouldn't be firewalled.\nI would set up the Time Capsule in bridge mode so it doesn't turn on DHCP/NAT, etc and connect to your router if possible over ethernet to one of the LAN ports and not the one WAN port. The ports you want look like this:\n\nAs long as it's in bridge mode and you connect over WiFi or a LAN port, everything should be fully functional and all Macs and PC will see the Time Capsule as if it were running the network. It might also function for bonjour sleep proxy and other nice to have items - but that also depends on the router settings.\n", "Q: Setting custom reminders for birthdays in ios calendar When a contact is associated with a birthday in ios contacts app, I see that person's birthday appear as an all-day event in the calendar app. However, I don't see how to update the event so that a custom reminder may be set. For example, I would like to be reminded 2 days in advance. \nI am using ios 6.0.1.\n\nA: Settings > Mail, contacts, calendars > Default alert times > birthdays\nApparently there are a few options here. You cannot specifically set a custom time at the time of my writing this, but it is possible to pick \"a day before\", \"2 days before\", \"1 week before\" or on day of event. I don't see a way to select a different time though other than 9 am. \n", "Q: Does Power Nap work for multiple users? My wife and I share a laptop at the house. Because iCloud works best when each individual has their own account (in particular reminders and photos), we each have our own iCloud accounts and therefor our own photo streams.\nI love that Power Nap will automatically pull down photos from Photo Stream and then back them up to Time Machine. It basically means that only videos are the thing at risk if my phone happens to explode or get stolen. So far so good.\nHowever, it is unclear (even when trying it!) if Power Nap will pull down photos for all users on the laptop, or if it'll only work for the logged in user. I've tried testing this myself and the results are inconclusive, so I'm guessing the answer is either \"No\" or \"Yes, but it's very buggy\". I'm hoping someone else has experience with this and can shed some light on what they've observed.\nWill Power Nap work for multiple users?\n\nA: Power Nap will receive user level data for any users that are logged in. If you have fast user switching enabled and both accounts are logged in when the Mac goes to sleep, both should get updates.\nIf there is a bug, it could be reported, but in the light testing I've done, everything seems to work well for users that have logged in.\nIf the user is not logged in, updates currently do not occur (OS X v10.8.2).\n", "Q: iTunes Match: download on mobile device I am considering buying and using iTunes Match. Is it possible to configure which songs will be available as a cached download on my mobile devices? It so, how? As a smart playlist or via \"download me\" clicks on the songs?\nI use my iPhone to play songs while I commute and I do not want to waste gigabytes of mobile traffic on streaming songs. \n\nA: One tap on a download icon will download an entire playlist of songs onto the local storage of the device. It doesn't matter if the playlist is a normal one or a smart playlist or a genius mix that you assemble on the go. You can also download albums, individual songs, everything by one artist, etc...\nFurthermore, You can easily toggle between showing all songs and just the downloaded songs to check before a trip if you want to grab more songs for offline play. The toggle is also nice when you want cellular data on, but want to avoid accidentally streaming more music from the cloud.\nI see no reason why worrying about data caps or cost would hold you back from getting match.\n\nA: You can create a smart playlist and download the songs in it. I don't think it is dynamic, i.e. you have to tap the iTunes/iCloud icon at rhe bottom of the playlist to download any songs that were newly added to the playlist.\n", "Q: Configure ipfw to filter by ip range I am a Linux user and very new to OSX. I have an OSX 10.7.5 \"Lion\" server that I am configuring as a webserver. I only have shell access.\nI am tryin to configure the firewall, but ipfw is quite different from iptables. Currently, all ports are open to the world. I would like to add the following rules:\n\n\n*\n\n*port 80/443: allow incoming connections from any IP address.\n\n*anything else: only allow incoming connections from within current subnet. \n\n\nHow would I accomplish this with ipfw?\n\nA: Although you seem fine handling the command line, on OS X it is best to use the Server Admin Tools (like @lupincho suggested). But how can you use the Server Admin Tools GUI when you only have terminal acces?\nYou can run the Server Admin Tools app from another mac, this will allow you to login on a remote server and change it's settings.\nIf you do not have a spare mac with the Server Admin Tools installed, you can do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*SSH into your remote OS X machine with an administrator’s log in and password.\n\n*Enable Remote Desktop (a.k.a. Screen Sharing, a.k.a. VNC) with this command:\n\nsudo\n  /System/Library/CoreServices/RemoteManagement/ARDAgent.app/Contents/Resources/kickstart\n  -activate -configure -access -on -clientopts -setvnclegacy -vnclegacy yes -clientopts -setvncpw -vncpw mypasswd -restart -agent -privs -all\n\n3) Login using a VNC client (such as TightVNC). Your password is \"mypasswd\" (see the -vncpw flag in the above command;  you can — and should — change this).\nNow you can open the Server Admin Tools and do your thing.\n4) When you are done, turn of screen sharing using your SSH session:\n\nsudo\n  /System/Library/CoreServices/RemoteManagement/ARDAgent.app/Contents/Resources/kickstart\n  -deactivate -configure -access -off\n\n", "Q: How to burn FLAC to audio CD? I want to burn .flac files directly to an audio CD. Is there any (possibly free) OS X application to do this?\n\nA: Yes, Burn is free and open source software, but it is a bit buggy. LiquidCD is freeware, but I didn't encounter any issues while using it.\n", "Q: Non-secure Jabber/Google Talk connection in Messages Every time I enable my Gmail account (Google Talk) in Messages, I get a message asking if I wish to continue with an unsecure Jabber login. This message reappears every time I open Messages on OS X Mountain Lion, and every few minutes if I keep the account on.\n\nI could just click \"Continue\" each time, or better yet, disable the warning in Settings, but I would rather connect with a secure login.\nIs there a way to get Messages to connect securely to Google Talk?\n\nA: econ-mit posted the answer here:  https://discussions.apple.com/thread/3745358?start=0&tstart=0\nMessages > Preferences... > Accounts (select Gmail Google Talk) > Server Settings > uncheck \"Automatically find server and port\" > click SSL\nWhen I did that, the Server field changed from gmail.com to talk.google.com and it immediately worked.\n\nA: You can't connect securely to Google Talk. \nAs you mentioned, it is possible to turn off the warning. In Messages, open Preferences, select the Accounts tab, then select your Google Talk account on the left. Go to the Server Settings tab on the right, then deselect \"Warn before sending password insecurely\". This checkbox will be disabled if the account is connected, so you'll have to disconnect to make that change.\n", "Q: iMessage User \"is not registered with iMessage\" Recently bought an iPhone 5 & iPad Mini.  Today tried to message a non-iphone user and got a red name icon in the addressee box that came up as \"...is not registered with iMessage\" that came up\" with an option to \"Remove\".  Did a little web search and discovered that the Mini iMessage\" option page in Settings does not show a toggle for \"Send as SMS\". My new and older iPhones do have that option and don't show the error message..even when I turn that toggle off.  I called Apple Help and was told that there is a fix for it, but that I would have to purchase a three month version of Apple Care for them to address it.  I really love my new Mini, but at $600+ if they won't fix a basic function, it's headed right back to the store.\nAny help would be appreciated\nThank you\n\nA: Messages on an iPad can't send an SMS so you can't send a message to a non-Apple phone. You'll need an SMS apple like Google Voice for that.\nThere Shouldn't be any problem sending an SMS from Messages on the iPhone though.\nI've never heard of a three month version of AppleCare but both the iPad Mini and iPhone 5 come with 90 days of free phone support and a year warranty so I don't know why Apple would want you to buy anything.\n", "Q: iTunes: How to prevent a purchased gigantic app/book from ever downloading? In iTunes, I have purchased some apps and books that are very large in size.\nI only purchased them in order to own them, taking advantage of a temporary low price, but I don't plan to use them any time soon.\nMy internet connection is not very fast and those downloads would take hours.\nAfter purchasing I stopped the download but iTunes will try to download them again when it finds a chance to do so.\nI have even deleted the downloads from the downloading list.\nBut every once in a while iTunes begins to download these gigantic apps/books again.\nHow can I tell iTunes not to download these purchases EVER unless I explicitly tell otherwise ?\n\nA: Email iTunes Customer Support - http://www.apple.com/support/itunes/contact/\nRequest them to 'clear your iTunes download queue'.\n\nA: You're better off just letting them download overnight. It'll take a couple of days to get iTunes support to clear the download queue. \n\nA: Did you check the iTunes Settings (CMD-,) > Store dialog. There are two options at the top:\n\n\n*\n\n*Check for new downloads automatically\n\n*Download pre-purchased items automatically\n\n\nA: The solution seem to be to stubbornly cancel the download every time you see it happening. After many times, somewhere in the Big Apple Mother Ship a sentient entity decided to stop trying.\n", "Q: How do I restore /Applications When trying to copy an application into /Applications, I accidentally copied MyApp.app/Contents into /Applications, turning it into an executable package instead of a folder.\nI have removed /Applications/Contents and made the app accessible as it should be (/Applications/MyApp.app/Contents), but /Applications did not revert to its former glory.\nCurrently, if I navigate to Applications in finder, it opens a terminal into /Applications :(\nEdit: I realized Applications is now of type \"package\". I followed the directions here: http://www.switchingtomac.com/tutorials/how-to-restore-a-folder-that-has-turned-into-a-package-in-os-x/ to no avail.\n\nA: OK - this is an odd one. The most straightforward solution would be to use Time Machine to restore /Applications from the backup prior to it becoming marked as a package and not as a folder.\nBarring that, You will need to boot into single user mode and delete /Application/Contents and perhaps some other files (it's hard to know what exactly else got messed up) by mounting the filesystem in read/write mode.\n /sbin/mount -uw /\n rm -rf /Applications/Contents\n # and optionally\n mv /Applications /badApplication_package\n\nAlternatively, you could try rebooting with Command R and just reinstalling the OS - hoping that /Applications gets corrected. If you were worried about the rm command, you could also rename /Applications and reinstall your OS - hand moving back just the Apps you need being careful not overwrite things again.\nThis is a rare problem to face - so congratulations on forcing yourself to learn how packages and apps get made on OS X the hard way.\n\nA: /Applications/Contents/ shouldn't normally exist, so it's unlikely that anything was overwritten. It's probably safe to remove it from Terminal:\nsudo rm -r /Applications/Contents/\n\n", "Q: Automatically Add To iTunes sending .m4v to Home Movies folder I updated iTunes to version 11 recently on my Windows 7 machine and now when I add Handbrake encoded movies (.m4v) via \"Automatically Add To iTunes\" it is moving those movies to the \"Home Movies\" section instead of \"Movies\".  Prior to iTunes 11 I could add an .m4v to that folder and it would put them in the \"Movies\" folder.\nIs there a way to revert that behavior?\n\nA: There's a setting in Get Info > Options to change it from being a Home Movie into being a Movie.\n", "Q: What does the Thunderbolt Display offer besides a display? Is the Apple Thunderbolt Display just a display, or something more?\nThe thing that confuses me is that they say it has a Thunderbolt cable and it helps data transfer between your Mac and Display to be much faster. What data transfer? Isn't it just a display mirroring whatever is already showing on the MacBook display? \nDoes it have a hard drive or something? \n\nA: The thunderbolt display actually has a number of additional peripherals in it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Gigabit-Ethernet Network interface card.\n\n*Firewire 800 interface \n\n*4 USB ports on a PCIe-USB adapter\n\n*Webcam (\"Facetime\") camera (connected internally via USB to the USB-PCIe adapter)\n\n*Speakers and a microphone (ditto)\n\n*It also has a laptop charger (magjack) for convenience.\nThis is accomplished via the fact that thunderbolt can carry PCIe signals in addition to the normal display image, so the peripherals in the display act like they're built into the laptop.\n\nThunderbolt combines PCI Express (PCIe) and DisplayPort (DP) into a serial data interface that can be carried over a single cable. Thunderbolt controller chips multiplex data lanes from these two sources for transmission via a duplex Thunderbolt lane then de-multiplex them for consumption from receiver chips.\n\n\nThere is actually the potential to even have an entire GPU in the external display, though no current devices implement the option.\n", "Q: Reinstalling a deleted app on my iPad with iOS 6 How can I restore an app on my iPad that I thought I didn't want, and deleted?  The App Store only lets me \"open\", not install. I want to know how I can get the icon back on my iPad.\n\nA: *\n\n*Open App Store. \n\n*click updates \n\n*select Purchased \n\n*change the tab from All to Not on This iPad\n\n\nIf it has been deleted it should have the cloud with the down arrow.\nIf it just says open, it could be that you haven't deleted it yet.... try swiping to the far left and using search... search for the app.\nIf you are having issues, turn off your ipad and back on again by holding down the power button then swipping to turn it off.\n", "Q: What can we do now that Facebook iPad app crashes on launch after update? A family member today updated the Facebook app on a 3rd generation iPad (retina display) running iOS 5 and now the app crashes every time one tries to launch it.  We've tried rebooting the device, deleting and reinstalling the app, and angrily glaring at the machine.\nThe old version worked. Is there a way to go back to the old version, to make the new version work, or to somehow solve this problem? We'd rather not upgrade to iOS 6 as part of the solution. iCloud backups are off; I don't know if there's some sort of local backup on our computer or not, or what we'd do if that were the case.\n\nA: Sadly, unless you have a computer with that accounts signed version of the old Facebook app, you can't get the old version from the iTunes Store. \nDeleting the app should have removed all preferences, so you can only make sure the crashes are being reported to Apple and hope the app is popular enough to get a bug fix rapidly. \nTo restore the old app from a computer, be sure to delete the faulty app before connecting the iPad to the computer. Then add the Facebook app from the computer being careful to not update it there. \n", "Q: Restore deleted Mac App Store on 10.8.2 I accidentally deleted system apps like the App Store.app and the Calendar.app.\nHow can I restore these?

Traveling with Macbook running 10.6 (recent upgrade from 10.5.8). It was a gift and does not have iPhoto. My Sony camera is jammed with images I would ordinarily unload to the big iMac at home (which has iPhoto). Without upgrading to the latest OS (which seems problematic) is there someplace I can acquire (buy, beg, borrow) an older version of iPhoto such as 8.1.2? The Apple site itself has some very unhappy reports from users of the new iPhoto. Upgrading this entire laptop to the latest OS just so I can download some images seems excessive. Or am I wimping out here?\n\nA: You say the camera is jammed, do you just need to move to make space on the camera?\nMost logical answer is to buy a new card for the camera... or connect the camera, use the USB features to move the photos off.  You will still have them when you back home to use on the big iMac at home.\nHowever, if you want the version just download 8.1.2.\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/DL970\n\nA: You don't need iPhoto to get the shots off the camera. You can do this with Image Capture (in your Applications Folder) and simply store them in folders until you get home.  You can't download iPhoto v8 - at least not legally - and the only way to install it is to purchase an iLife 09 disk. \n", "Q: facetime with same apple id and on different devices I will be setting up one apple id to use for all the apps for all my three kids on their three ipads, will they be able to facetime each other using the same apple ids?  Or do I have to create different ids for them in order to facetime each other?  Thank you.\n\nA: You can use the same apple id.  Just add unique special email addresses to your apple id.\nThis link explains it nicely.  http://ipad.about.com/od/iPad_Guide/ss/How-To-Use-FaceTime-On-The-iPad_2.htm\n\nDo you want to place calls between two iDevices using the same Apple ID? By default, all devices connected to the same Apple ID utilize the primary email address associated with that Apple ID. This emails they'll all ring if a FaceTime call is placed to that email address. It also means you can't place a class between two devices, just as you can't use one home phone to place a call to your house and answer it with another phone. But luckily, Apple has provided a rather easy workaround for placing FaceTime calls on the same Apple ID.\nTo place a FaceTime call between two of your Apple devices, you will simply need to add a new email address to one of the devices. This will allow FaceTime to differentiate between the two and place a call to a specific device.\n\n\nA: So far so good. You end up with ALL email addresses (that is your initial email address associated with your Apple ID AND all additional email addresses added under Settings > Facetime on any of your iOS devices) listed on EACH device (linked to your Apple ID) both under Settings > Facetime AND under Settings > Messages > Send & Receive. \nYou still have to select the desired email address on each device, both in Settings > Facetime AND in Settings > Messages > Send & Receive. And you possibly have to deselect any email address that previously was selected per device (e.g., the email address associated with your Apple ID that would be selected by default).\nDo some testing by placing Facetime calls, and separate testing with iMessages, across your various iOS devices to be sure that you got it right.\n", "Q: How can I recover an unresponding application without quitting? I've just run a very long Matlab simulation on my Mac Book Air. It uses Mac OSX. The simulation has practically finished, but seconds before the end, Matlab appeared in the activity monitor as not responding.\nI really do not want to loose all the simulation data that has taken me so long to obtain. Is there a way of relaunching the application without quitting ? Or any way to get the data that has already been calculated ?\nPlease help!\n\nA: Regardless of how important the process is, if it’s hung it’s hung. Quitting the finder is one way to see if you can recover it.  Quitting all open applications is anther suggestion.\nI would recommend opening up a terminal window and typing the following to see if you get any clues:\nsudo lsof | grep matlab\n\nlsof is a Unix command that basically means “list open files”. The | next to that is a pipe command which basically means output should be processed by the command to the immediate right. And grep basically filters out the output based on criteria. In this case, matlab itself.\nIf you run that it should list all open files which also means connected processes. If you are not used to the terminal output this could be overwhelming, but looking through the output line by line might reveal something.\nAnd if you are up for it, I would recommend installing htop in OS X. It’s a very nice and—in my opinion—more useful version of top which shows all system basics in a live updated screen. Installing in not easy and might require Xcode, but once up and running it will help you further debug things.\nFor example, if you can start htop and then hit the T key to show all processes in threaded mode.  Meaning you can then see all the child processes connected to matlab and get more clues there.\n\nA: Unfortunately, if matlab hangs, you can't recover it. \nMaybe you could force launch a second instance of matlab. Maybe it can recover your simulation.\n\nA: I don't know much about matlab – but could relaunching the finder also be an idea? …or have you tried that already?\n", "Q: Should I use my personal Apple ID for development or create a new one? I'm about ready to release my first iOS app. While I was going through the steps to register in the development program I became unsure.\nShould I set up a new iTunes account to publish my app under, or do I just use my existing personal one that I use for my games, music, etc.?\nI read somewhere that whatever account you use gets a bit of spam, how do users get your email address?\n\nA: There isn't a hard and fast rule, or many convincing arguments in either direction. However, if you eventually want to make money or work with others, or in general grow in that direction, you may find that the ability to keep your personal and work stuff separate to be helpful. \nA simple example may be that you have personal pictures on iCloud associated with your personal ID, and for whatever reason, you want to give someone complete access to your development account without access to iCloud. Yes, there are other ways to accomplish that, but having the option of two different Apple IDs might come in helpful down the road.\n", "Q: iMac freezing with graphical artifacts, what to do? My iMac 27\" from 2011 has recently been experiencing random freezes. It either restarts or I am forced to reboot (holding power button several seconds). When frozen the iMac does not respond to pings and nothing at all is written to the system logs.\nSymptoms are graphics issues which happens just before it freezes. Tearing, flickering and random graphical artifacts. When it freezes, it usually shows a screen with striped patterns, a grey or black screen. I have checked CPU and GPU temperature and there are no problems with overheating.\nOnce it hangs and I reboot, the computer usually fails to boot and hangs during boot with a gray screen. At this point I cannot get it to boot at all, except into single (console) mode. Checking disks reveals nothing and running apples hardware tests tells me everything is ok.\nIf I leave the computer turned off for a while (say over the night) and then try to boot it, everything works. \nSomeone suggested it may be power-related somehow, but I have no idea how to check that.\nAny ideas how to diagnose this?\n\nA: Turned out to be a faulty graphics card. I replaced it with a new, and problems went away.\n\nA: I have seen the same problem on an iMac 27\" 2011 with an i7 3.4Ghz. Apple has a replacement program. You can find more infos here:\nhttp://support.apple.com/en-us/HT203787\nI found a temporary solution. The iMac can recover from this mode. Just put the iMac to sleep. When it wakes up it's fine again. Use the sleep button on your Mac. Alternatively you can do this with SSH. So you could use your phone to fix the iMac. Just connect to your Mac with SSH. Then type the following:\npmset sleepnow\n\nAfter that you should disconnect. If your machine doesn't sleep. You could use PleaseSleep.app or a similar application to make sure it goes to sleep.\n", "Q: Can you get Apple Logo to glow upon new mail under Power Nap? Is it possible to be notified of new emails whilst on Power Nap, e. g. via a glowing Apple Logo or some LED (e. g. the LED on the charger)?\n\nA: Unfortunately, it's not possible. \n", "Q: remove highlighting from Stickies? Text that is copied from a web browser and pasted into the native Stickies app often brings text highlighting along with it and I haven't been able to find a way to remove the highlighting within Stickies. My current workaround is to paste the text into MacVim and then re-copy and paste it into Stickies.\nIs there a way to remove highlighting within Stickies? Even better would be a way to remove all text formatting within Stickies.\n\nA: I suggest that you try the “Paste and match style” menu command, right below “Paste” - the corresponding shortcut is ⇧–⌥–⌘-V. It will paste the content, but strip all the associated formatting.\n\nA: You make a  new sticky note, type in a word (for example \"test\") and select it.\nClick right, go to fonts and then style.\nMake the word in the style you want and add it to your favourite styles and give it a name (for example \"MyStyle\").  And save it.\nNow, delete the sticky your just made.\nGo to your sticky with the \"problem\" and select all.\nRight-click and go to fonts and style\nClick on favorite styles and select \"MyStyle\"\nClick apply  \nThis should do the trick.\n\nA: Highlight all the text and right-click, go to font>styles and you can just click 'apply' to make all the styles match.\n\nA: Text formatting can be changed by selecting the relevant text and typing Cmd-T.\n\nA: I found a solution. Open up a Microsoft Word document and paste it there, then click the Remove All font option in the menus. Afterwards, you'll be able to copy and paste into the Stickies without highlightings.  \n", "Q: Document upload/sync with iTunes 11 I have updated iTunes to version 11 and I can't Find the spot where to upload and sync documents anymore (to use in iAnnotate for instance).

I am running a first generation iPad with iOS 5.1.1 (the most recent version it will ever have) and I just noticed today that the application Shazam has just dropped support for iOS 5 on the latest version of their app. Seeing that this is probably going to be a first of many apps, is there a way to hide updates that can't be installed on your current version of iOS, so that only updates that is compatible with iOS 5 (and my iPad)  will be displayed in the list of updates in the App Store?\nThis could get kind of messy in the App Store update list with a future shuffled mess of things that I can or can't upgrade or even worse a complete list of stuff that I can't upgrade to too! Are there any work around or fixes to hide that impending mess?\n\n\nA: It's a bug that has been present for years. There unfortunately isn't a way to stop getting notification updates, unless you uninstall the app, which you really shouldn't have to do. Lets hope this bug is fixed soon, you can tell them about it here:\napple.com/support/feedback/\n\nA: Apple is trying to \"force\" everyone to update - currently, there is no solution to this. \n\nA: You can't hide them yet but, you will be able to download the lastest version of an app that worked on your version of iOS. Apple recently addressed this problem with some changes made to the iOS app store. \nAs noted here Apple now offering older iOS device owners 'last compatible version' of apps\n\n\nApple has begun offering owners of older iOS devices the \"last compatible version\" of apps that will run on their device, as noticed by Reddit members. For example, if an iPhone 3G owner tries to download the latest Twitter app, a dialog box will pop up alerting them that the most recent version of the app is not compatible with their device, but they can opt to download the last version that will run.\n\n", "Q: Why is my Mac's CPU throttled? (Turbo Boost Ratio) AnandTech has a instructions1 on how you can check the Turbo Ratios for the Mac's CPU. Since they are logged, the information is very easy to find.\n\nIn Mountain Lion you can do this the following way:\n\n*\n\n*Open /Applications/Utilities/Console.app\n\n*Open the system.log on the left side.\n\n*Search for entries containing Turbo Ratios\n\nWhat you'll find is something like this:\nDec 16 20:11:47 localhost kernel[0]: AppleIntelCPUPowerManagement: Turbo Ratios 0035\n\nAnd this means:\n\nThe line above lists turbo ratios as 0035. The four digit number is the turbo ratio for the active cores\n(4C/3C/2C/1C). Depending on the active cores, the clock speed\ncan vary. Each number is hexadecimal.\nThe first two numbers are 0s because the CPU doesn't have more than\ntwo cores and thus doesn't support any turbo ratios when 4 or 3 cores\nare active (2012 Macbook Air, i5-3427U). The third number tells us the\nmaximum turbo boost with two cores active: 3. That's 3 bins, where\neach bin is 100MHz, or 300MHz above the stock 1.8GHz operating\nfrequency (2.1GHz).\nThe fourth number gives us max turbo when only a single core is\nactive: 5. Five bins is 500MHz, which on top of the 1.8GHz base\nfrequency gives us 2.3GHz.\n(Edited text from AnandTech to fit my CPU.)\n\nHowever, according to notebookcheck.net2 the Turbo Ratio should be 008A or 1.8GHz/2.6GHz/2.8GHz. This would be in line with Apple's advertisement3 for the 2012 13\" Macbook Air:\n\nThis raises the obvious question: Why is my Mac's CPU throttled?\n\n*\n\n*I wish I were able to use the MSR tools to get more information about the clock speeds, but for them to work I need to boot in 32-bit kernel mode which is not available in Mountain Lion anymore.\n\n\n*MacCPUID4 is an official tool by Intel which you can use to calculate the current CPU clock. The current version 2.1 has been released on the 10/31/2012 but still seems buggy. No matter how I stress my CPU, it always calculates that the clock is at a constant 2.3 GHz.\n\nA: So, I ran some Cinebench R11.5 benchmarks to get more information about the single threaded performance of my i5-3427U1 (1.8-2.8 GHz) CPU:\n\n1 thread → 1.10\n\nI also contacted the author of the linked article by AnandTech - @anandshimpi2.  Anand Lal Shimpi was so kind to send me a benchark chart which compared the single threaded performance of the 2011 13\" Macbook Airs with the 2012 13\" Macbook Airs using Cinebench R11.5.\nInto this picture, I have added information about the maximum single threaded CPU clocks along with a comparison of the measured performance such as Anand Lal Shimpi has suggested.\n\n[image source]\nIn this info graphic I am comparing specifically:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*2011 13\" Macbook Air, i5-2557M 1.7GHz/2.4GHz/2.7GHz\n  \n*2012 13\" Macbook Air, i5-3427U 1.8GHz/2.6GHz/2.8GHz\n\nAs you can see, the single threaded clock of the 2012 model is 3.7% increased in turbo boost mode.\nHowever, the benchmark score saw a 9.9% increase which is not simply due to the higher clock, but also due to the more efficient Ivy Bridge architecture which is about 5-15% faster3 than Sandy Bridge. \nIn sum, the benchmark scores are as expected whereas the Turbo Ratios log entries are not. Anand Lal Shimpi had \"figured it was a bug, submitted it to Apple back in July\"4.\n", "Q: Any suggestions to get an Audio CD to load I just purchased four albums with a total of 6 CDs.  Four of the CDs work just fine.  Two of them will not load on both of my laptops.  When I push them into the CD slot, I hear the drive spin up and down a few times and then the CD is kicked back out.\nBoth of the troublesome CDs work in my truck.  If it was just one, I'd assume it was just a bad CD but two out of six plus the fact that they work in my truck leads me to assume that Apple's software is goofed up somehow.\nOne laptop is an early 2007 15\" MBP with 10.6.8.  The other laptop is early 2011 17\" MBP with 10.7.5.  Both have the latest iTunes 11 and all of the updates, etc.\nI tried even booting the 2007 MBP in safe mode but it had the same issue.  I've tried setting the CD / DVD preferences to various settings (e.g. ignore) but no change.\nHas anyone else seen this?  Does anyone have a work around?\n\nA: I had the same pb with CD's or DVD's that are a little thicker than normally. Perhaps some sticker on top of the CD/DVD. In my case I was using CD who are labeled and my MBP. If you are using new CD then there is a quality pb with it.\n", "Q: Can I import songs I downloaded into garageband on my iPad, with no laptop fileshare? Im a rapper, so all I want to do is import a beat onto garageband and record my vocals over that. Problem is I don't have a laptop, just the iPad. I have downloaded instrumetals on other apps. Is it possible to import these files into garageband just using the iPad(as this is all I have at my disposal)?\n\nA: I created a:\nGarageband Mac to iPad Oneshot Converter at the fixed1t blog.\nhttp://fixed1t-music-software.blogspot.co.uk/2013/01/mac-garageband-to-ipad-one-shot.html\nit has links to free trial software, youtube video and an ebay purchase £5.\n", "Q: Why does the folder icon in my Terminal have a question mark overlaid? From time to time, I spot that the folder icon in the titlebar of one of my Terminal windows has a question mark overlaid on it, e.g. this one:\n\nWhat does this mean? It doesn't seem to have any effect or issues that I've noticed - I'm just curious.\nI'm using OS X 10.8 (Mountain Lion).\n\nA: The question mark (and disabled popup menu items) indicates that Terminal thinks the working directory is on a remote computer, and therefore you cannot navigate to it in Finder using the popup menu. If you look at the last item in the popup menu (Command-Click on the “proxy” icon) you'll see the computer/host that Terminal thinks the working directory is on. You should find that it is not the computer’s current name.\nIf you’re using bash (the default shell on macOS), by default it sends a control sequence to the terminal at each prompt to tell Terminal the current working directory. Since control sequences can come from local or remote computers, it sends a “file:” scheme URL including the hostname, and Terminal verifies that the name maps to the current machine. If it doesn’t, Terminal disables the path popup menu items, because they don't correspond to local directories.\nYou can see the code that sends the control sequence in /etc/bashrc_Apple_Terminal (or /etc/bashrc on older versions of macOS).\n[Note that if you’re not using bash, or you’ve customized it so the default behavior doesn’t occur, but your shell (or some other program you’re running) is sending control sequences to set the window or tab (icon) title, Terminal will examine it to see if it contains what looks like a pathname, and then it checks whether that corresponds to a valid local pathname. If not, it doesn’t display the window proxy icon at all.]\nA scenario where Terminal can fail to recognize that the “file:” URL is on the current host is if you change your network configuration while a shell is running. A common case is putting a portable computer to sleep and moving to another location, then waking it. The local host name and address will have changed, but the shell’s $HOSTNAME environment variable still has the old host name, and that’s what it sends in the control sequence. To fix this, update the environment variable with:\n HOSTNAME=$(hostname)\n\nAnother scenario is where you quit Terminal, change network configurations, then open Terminal with Resume enabled. Terminal will restore the windows and tabs, along with the last working directory URL that each was sent. If you run into this case, $HOSTNAME will be up to date—since it starts a new shell—but Terminal can still have a stale URL until you get the shell to update it again. If displaying the command prompt doesn’t clear up the problem, try changing directories with cd to get the shell to update it.\n", "Q: To repair permissions for Lion, is it safe to use Disk Utility in Recovery OS for Mountain Lion? Background and question\nI read of someone using a Mountain Lion Recovery System to attempt repair permissions of an installation of Lion. \nI understand that for repair of permissions of Lion, it may be preferable to use OS X 10.7.5 or Recovery OS 10.7.5. \nA question remains: \n\n\n*\n\n*for repair of permissions of an installation of Lion, is it safe to use Disk Utility in a Mountain Lion Recovery OS? \n\n\nNotes\ndiskutil(8) OS X Manual Page\n\n… The data that guides the permissions verification is written during the installation process. …\n\n– but it's not clear whether that data is read from the selected volume when Disk Utility is run from a Recovery OS. \nFor verbs verifyPermissions and repairPermissions a plist is optional, but there's no interface to this in Disk Utility. \nrepair_packages(8) OS X Manual Page\nThanks to commentary, I see that an OS X run of Disk Utility to repair permissions involves both diskutil and repair_packages. Here's a line from output of fs_usage:\n03:06:31  access            r/libexec/repair_packages    0.000019   diskmanageme\n\nFor another run, a little later, \nmacbookpro08-centrim:~ gjp22$ sudo fs_usage | grep \"usr/sbin/diskutil\"\n03:09:24  open              usr/sbin/diskutil                                                                0.000021   repair_packa\n^C\nmacbookpro08-centrim:~ gjp22$ \n\n– at the same time, \nmacbookpro08-centrim:~ gjp22$ sudo execsnoop | grep 'diskutil\\|repair_packages'\n    0   7963   7143 repair_packages\n^C\nmacbookpro08-centrim:~ gjp22$ \n\nOS X: About OS X Recovery\nThis Apple article mentions Disk Utility but not permissions of files. \nAbout Disk Utility's Repair Disk Permissions feature\n\nA: The diskutil repairpermissions /Volumes/whatever reads the BOM and receipts from /Volumes/whatever and not /. You can validate this with fs_usage and installing OS X on an external volume and running the check while snooping the IO.\nIt's always preferable to have the OS doing the repairing match the OS on the volume being repaired, but I've never been bitten with a problem by mixing things where a newer OS repairs an older OS. I've gone the other way in a pinch and not had it blow up, but I did make plans to run a proper repair when time was available soon thereafter.\nAlso - this is a very rare tool and like antiboitics, often gets prescribed erroneously. Repairing permissions only twiddles with Apple software and rarely is a problem due to incorrect permissions on a log file or an Application bundle.\n\nA: It should be safe, but it won't be optimal. The repair process reads the installer receipts from the volume being repaired, so it'll be using the right version receipts. HOWEVER, it'll be using the Mountain Lion (wrong version) rules for which package IDs to use the receipts for, as well as a few overrides and additions that aren't receipt-based. Net result: it'll be mostly correct, but not perfect.\nYou'll get best results running the permissions repair while booted from the system you're going to repair. There's no problem repairing the live system. In fact, the only time I'd recommend running permissions repair booted from something else is if they permissions are so badly messed up that it can't even boot.\n(I had to deal with a system like that once. What I did was run a repair from an installer DVD -- this was a while ago -- to get the permissions fixed well enough to boot; then I ran it again from the live system to fine-tune anything that didn't get done right by the DVD-based repair.)\n\nA: I did a repair disk permission on a previous osx and it ruined my system. It worked fine before then not afterward when it would lock up or act flaky. I no longer use this command. \n", "Q: Why won't iTunes download HD movies? I'm running iTunes 11 on a retina MacBook Pro, and when I try to download HD movies, iTunes shows me a dialog alert saying \"This  cannot be played in HD on this computer.\" The dialog goes on to imply that I have a choice to proceed or to but the standard def version, but I don't see a way to buy the HD version.\n\nWhy can't iTunes 11 play HD movies on a retina MacBook Pro?

However it is no longer supported or developed — at the moment it still works well, but as OS X changes, that may no longer be the case.\nFor third party players, VLC is pretty robust and will play virtually anything you can find. It has the benefit of ongoing development, but the interface is not always the best (the preferences in particular are pretty convoluted). You can also look at MplayerX. There are other options (Movist and Niceplayer come to mind), but none seem to have been updated in the past year or more.\n", "Q: 10.8.2 DNS in hosts lookup slow As a web developer, I need to make a domain redirect to localhost.

I have tried other things to fix but I can't seem to fine a good enough solution. Also, my pc is brand new and I built so there is no optical drive. Plus, i have never installed windows before.\n\nA: No. Bootcamp will make a bootable copy of Windows for a Mac only. Macs have UEFI instead of traditional BIOSes. PCs are adopting this technology but slowly.\nI believe OS X formats the USB stick using GUID/HFS+, which PCs and Windows do not like. There are just too many hurdles to believe a bootable copy of Windows will work on a PC. \nHowever, you could try this alternative method: Creating A Bootable USB Of Windows 8.1 On OS X?\nNote: Just make sure the USB stick is formatted using MBR instead of GUID to maximize impartiality.\n\nA: When I used the Bootcamp Assistant to create a bootable USB from my Windows 8 ISO  my PC just hung on a flashing cursor in text mode while the activity light on my USB key blinked.\nI believe the Apple Bootcamp installer prepares the USB key for EFI boot only (because that's what Mac's need) and does not properly prepare MBR boot code.  My motherboard (ASRock H77-PRO4-M) fully supports EFI, but defaults to trying MBR boot.  I had to explicitly choose the UEFI boot option form my boot menu (F11 or F12 at power on) and with that the installer booted perfectly:\n\n\nA: You can boot a drive that doesn't contain BootCamp Helper from a Mac, but you can't boot a drive that does contain BootCamp Helper from a PC. \nInstalling BootCamp Helper on a External Drive for both PC and Mac is just like installing it on a Mac. Have a look at this Apple Discussion where the OP has installed BootCamp Helper on a regular PC for more information.\n\nApple \"Boot Camp\" is the motherboard chip support. PCs don't have a Mac logicboard. Windows does not like having mobo drivers that don't belong.\n\n\nA: I tried most of the methods listed in this thread to create a Windows 7 bootable USB and none worked for me. What ended working was:\n\n\n*\n\n*Follow the steps in Boot Camp to create the bootable USB.\n\n*Install Parallels on my mac loading Windows from the USB I created in step 1.\n\n*In Parallels, download and install Windows USB/DVD download tool\n\n*Use Windows USB/DVD download tool in Parallels to create the new properly formatted bootable USB.\n\n\nA: For what it's worth, I'm running macOS Sierra using version 6.1.0 of Boot Camp Assistant. I was able to create a bootable USB drive from a Windows 10 .iso file by selecting the \"Create a Windows 7 or later version install disk,\" after first formatting the drive using Disk Utility to DOS_FAT_32 filesystem and MBR partition.\nWhen I plugged the drive into my newly built PC, I was able to successfully boot from the USB drive and install Windows 10. After installation was completed, a notice did pop up saying that my machine wasn't compatible with Boot Camp, so I assume that Boot Camp Assistant included some Mac-specific drivers and support libraries that aren't necessary on Windows. However, I don't think that should cause any issues, and I was able to produce a bootable USB drive using Boot Camp Assistant.\nThe answer here also seems to indicate that this should be possible.\n", "Q: Why can't I add new m4v videos to my iTunes library? Using iTunes 11.0.1, I tried to add some newly converted movies to my library for consumption on my Apple TV 2. This used to work well: ripping some movies from my DVDs, converting them using HandBrake with the AppleTV or AppleTV 2 setting and adding them to my media library. However, now nothing happens when I add the movie using Cmd-O in iTunes or via Drag-And-Drop from the Finder. Opening the movie via right click in the Finder in iTunes works however, and I can even stream to the AppleTV then. So what's wrong? I checked in the console logs, and can't find any iTunes related error messages.\n\nA: Are you sure you're looking in the right Media section of your library?  Try looking in Music Videos, TV, etc, in case iTunes is putting it in the \"wrong\" section.\n\nA: I've found if you switch to the list view before adding it seems to work much better.\n\nA: iTunes doesn't play well with items added via ⌘ cmd+O, so just transfer your media file into the Music → iTunes → iTunes Media → Automatically add to iTunes folder. Make sure iTunes is not running when you do this, then when you start it up, it should show the file under 'Movies'.\n\nA: Since iTunes 11 I haven't had these problems anymore.

Sometimes email files types come as attachments in email messages. How do I open such type of mail in my ipad?\n\nA: Email file viewer app from Kupon B.G known as Klammer. That is available in Apple's App Store. It will open Outlook .msg files, standard .eml files, and also winmail.dat files on your iPad. \nFirst open email using the iPad's Mail application.  The file attachments were immediately visible in the email. \nTo view the file attachments just simply touched the .eml file we wanted to view, pressing on it for a full two seconds.  iPad then opened a window asking us which application we wanted to use to open the file.  then choose Klammer\nIt will view .eml file immediately appeared rendered in full html formatting.\nIt is a very simple app  for opening .msg and .eml email messages.\nKlammer is no longer a free app, it is now $0.99 USD.\n\nA: If you just have a couple of  .eml files and you don't want to install software, there is a website called MessageViewer Online that will decode your .eml files and let you read the contents in your web browser.

I installed an SSD in my 2011 Mac Mini to run alongside the stock 500GB HDD. After carefully reading through a number of tutorials, I used Terminal to merge them into a single \"Fusion Drive\". I cloned my data back over, and all seems to be running perfectly. I'm seeing a very nice bump in speed in starting up and launching apps, and other disk-intensive activities.\nIn browsing through various articles and forum posts on the topic, I see some people claiming success doing this with various Mac models, but others claiming that home-brewed Fusion Drives may not actually be migrating data correctly between the SSD and HDD. In particular, this OWC tutorial claims that this ONLY works with a 2012 Mac Mini because \"these are the only machines that currently have a version of Disk Utility that can create a Fusion volume\". In the comments, the authors further state that\n\nAccording to our techs, when using any version of Disk Utility other\n  than the one that came with the 2012 Mac mini, it will appear as\n  though you have a Fusion Drive, but it will not behave as such. You\n  would be essentially creating a standard Core Storage volume rather\n  than Fusion.\n\nMy question is: is there a way, without buying specialized dignostic software, to verify whether or not the essential \"fusion\" of data migration is occurring between HDD and SSD? \n\nA: You can use the command-line iostat tool to monitor disk activity on a per-drive basis.\nRunnning iostat disk1 disk2 1 will give you an output of disk activity for disk1 and disk2 every second. You'll want to change the disk identifiers to match those of your HDD and SSD.\nBy running this command while you write a bunch of data to your drive (the dd command can be useful for this), you can watch which drives the writes are hitting. Once you fill up your SSD, it should start writing to the HDD, and once the writes are done, you should see some activity transferring ~4 GB off the SSD to the HDD.\nYou can also test whether data is promoted off the HDD by reading some data off the HDD (again, dd is useful for this). Depending on how much use your Fusion drive has already had, you may need to repeatedly read the same data in order to get it promoted, but once it happens, you should see some transfer activity, once you're done all your reading.\nFor some more detailed descriptions of how and what to look for on a DIY Fusion drive, check out the latest posts on this Tumblr.\n\nA: The above information is outdated. Up until Mountain Lion 10.8.2 you could only get a do-it-yourself Fusion Drive on a Mac Mini 2012 just like the OP said. On other machines you would just create a Core Storage Volume. The disks would be see as one, but Mountain Lion would just fill up the SSD first and then the HDD. It would not copy files to the SSD based on frequent use, which is the great selling point of a Fusion Drive, because you get near SSD storage for the most juste files, not just the oldest files.\nApparently since Mountain Lion version 10.8.3 the Fusion Drive works on all Macs with a Core Storage Volume based on a faster en slower drive. See this updated tutorial for 10.8.3 and above: http://blog.macsales.com/17624-os-x-10-8-3-provides-fusion-drive-setup-option-for-non-fusion-drive-equipped-macs I haven't been able to confirm it myself, so I really hope they are right. I've already created the Core Storage Volume, but the disk is not full enough to tell if Fusion works for my setup (iMac 2010).\n\nA: One difference I've found - and not solved - is that the recovery partition, for some reason, seems to not work properly.\nAnd Internet recovery - at least for older machines - seems to be based on Lion with CoreStorage versions that do not understand Fusion Drives.\nMake sure you test your recovery partition. If it doesn't work, and if you don't have a flash recovery disk, you may wind up screwed.\n\nA: Based on jollyjinx's articles, I made this script which I used to help me test that my DIY Fusion setup is working correctly: https://gist.github.com/11522980\nBasically, you have to fill the SSD with garbage files until they flow onto the HDD, then repeatedly access files from the HDD while watching disk activity. Eventually the HDD activity will stop and SSD activity will continue (or start), meaning the files have been effectively transferred.\nAlso, I’m using Mavericks and the two Fused drives are both external drives.\n\nA: On Yosemite you can use the command 'diskutil cs info' and the corestorage UUID as a parameter.\nThere will be a line in the output table that shows \"Fusion:\".  On my core storage volume it showed \"NO\". I have a 2011 iMac.  \nSure enough, performance led me to investigate this and all the test scripts and commands I found show that it was not a true Fusion volume, just a corestorage spanned disk, but this simple command confirmed it in a couple of seconds.  \n\nA: further to Funball's comment...\nyou need the UUID of the logical volume group and not the logical volume and then you should see something like\nRole:                       Logical Volume Group (LVG)\nUUID:                       58E64811-56C5-4EBC-BE0B-5AF217AA2ABE\nLVG Name:                   Fusion\nLVG Version:                1\nLVG Size:                   1511111114752 B\nLVG Free Space:             106496 B\nLVG Status:                 Online\nLVG Sparse:                 Yes\nFusion Drive:               Yes\n", "Q: Install direct downloaded IOS 6.0.1 I've downloaded IOS 6.0.1 from direct link(not using iTunes).

I have icloud turned on everywhere and I do see certain notes synced across my devices but some are just on one.\nIs there anyway to determine what the issue is?  Is there a known issue with notes not syncing properly?\nAny suggestions are appreciated.\n\nA: It is possible you have an email account with \"Notes\" enabled on your iPhone, but don't have the same account set up on your Mac. \nOn your iPhone, in the Notes listing, tap \"Accounts\" in the upper left corner. Mentally review those accounts.\nOn your Mac, click the Navigation icon that shows two lists next to a box, and makes sure the accounts are the same.\n\nIf the accounts aren't the same, setup the missing accounts on your Mac in Mail Preferences. Also, if you have an Note \"Account\" on your iPhone that is named something like \"On my iPhone\", transfer those notes to an account that syncs. You can accomplish that by, tapping the Share icon in the note, tap \"Copy\", tap \"Notes\" to view your list of notes, tap \"Accounts\", tap an account that will sync to your Mac, tap the \"+\" icon, tap and hold, paste the note that. (Hopefully you don't have too many notes that need that action).\n\nA: I thought I would add that I found I could simply add a return to the end of each note in iPhone that was not showing up on my Mac and it automatically synced the note the the Mac.  Not sure why it worked but it was easier than copy and pasting every note.\n\nA: I have had this problem as well, and looked at each of the settings in my iPhone 5 (with OS 9.3.1), after reading the advice above and other threads.\n\n\n*\n\n*In Notes, select the account folder you want to move notes from (ex.

I'd like to delete specific messages from a conversation in Messages 7.0.1 – is this possible? The messages in question originated from iPhones where you can tap \"Edit\" and select individual messages for deletion, which I've done, but I can't find a way to delete them from Messages on my Mac (where they appear because I have iCloud syncing turned on form Messages).\n\nA: I found out how to do it: single click on the message/picture you want to delete so that it is highlighted. Then, right-click and you will be given the option to \"Forward...\", \"Copy\", or \"Delete...\" the message. Click \"Delete...\".\nNote: Doing so will ONLY delete that message from Messages on your Mac. If you want to delete the same message on any particular iOS device (iPhone, iPod Touch, iPad), you have to delete it on each device individually.\n\nA: Double click the messages, and tap Delete. You will receive a prompt verifying your desire to delete that message. Accept the prompt, and the message should be gone on your Mac.\nIn my testing, it looks like you may also have to delete from your syncing iOS device as well. It certainly isn't an instantaneous sync over.\n\nA: I just did on my Mac Mini Server running Mountain Lion. Click to select the message you want to delete. Then hit backspace. You get the message: Are you sure you want to delete this message? Click Delete and it's gone!\n\n", "Q: How to set default number formatting in Numbers?

Is there a way to have two separate Apple IDs on the same email address?  If not how is the best way to keep their itunes card money separate?\n\nA: No - an Apple ID is a unique string, so you can't enter the same letters for two as the first reserves that \"email\" and prevents a second account.\nYou can have alases in one email account so that mails to more than one address get delivered to the same account. Google allows this with punctuation and arbitrary letters after a + in the email name. You can also enter punctuation like periods so if your email is RobynWhatever, mail to Robyn.Whatever also gets delivered to the first gmail account.\nThe only way is to have separate email account, you cannot use the same email for different account.\nIf I understand correctly, you want to have control over those accounts and receive the monthly purchased email in one account. You can setup 2 email accounts with forwarding service which will send all the mail from their account to your main email account.\n\nA: iTunes accounts are tied to an Apple ID so if you want to keep their accounts separate you'll need two IDs. And as IDs are not allowed to have the same email address you'll need separate ones there as well. \nOptions:\n\n\n*\n\n*set app free email addresses for them (e.g. on Gmail) and set auto-forwarding to your account\n\n*create aliases for your iCloud account and use these\n\n*create individual iCloud addresses for them and set auto-forwarding there \n\n\nThinking ahead I would recommend the third option. In a few years they will want/need their own mail address anyway. \n\nA: There can be multiple Apple IDs connected to a single Gmail account, because Google lets you insert dots (and maybe other characters, not sure) between letters in the account name. Apple doesn’t recognize aa@gmail.com and a.a@gmail.com as being the same email address but Google does, so you can sign up for a separate ID using each of them and (assuming you own that particular gmail address) now you have two IDs which both use the same inbox for validation and account purposes. Repeat as needed.\n", "Q: Help with a HD reformat and Mountain Lion reinstall due to unknown type of hack, Malware, etc So, I needed to reformat the HD in my mid 2011 Mac Mini (done) and plan to reinstall Mountain Lion on it.  I created an SDXC install disk to do this.  I'm curious to know if the disk2 partition with the Mac OS X Base System that appears in Disk Utility (as well as any other hidden partition) is the original boot partition from the previous installation of Mountain Lion carried over or is it all new from the install disk I created?\nHere is why I ask...I had a nasty and reappearing hack, Trojan, Bot, or Malware of some sort that I want to make sure there are no remnants of when I do this install again.  Over the course of almost three months, I have done this process twice, as have the folks at the Genius bar, and it keeps coming back.  What ever it is, also appeared on my iMac (running Snow Leopard), but I did not have any luck after wiping and reinstalling the OS from the CD, twice as well.  It also appeared on my Windows laptop (running Vista), which is currently sitting with the battery removed, and the iMac is unplugged, while I focus on my Mac Mini.  One note of similarity with all of this is that there was a significant amount of network activity on all of these PC's, even without an Ethernet connection/cable attached, and with the connections disabled as well, including wifi and Bluetooth.  My AEBS has also been factory reset many times.  It was thought that my iPhone was somehow providing the internet connection, which has also been wiped twice, as well as my iPad.  I do know that my network was hacked internally by my ex, who is my ex for this very reason. \nThe one difference with my attempt at the OS install this time is that the install disk that I am using has been reformatted and the copy of Mountain Lion I am using was created from a newly downloaded file, versus the previous disk I had made, that was accessible to my ex, and could have possibly been tampered with.  I have considered reflashing the EFI too, as I have read here that it could also be a hiding place for whatever this is, but I thought I would try this first, as I would be able to tell fairly quickly if it reappears, based on the network activity that shows up.\nI hope the predicament I'm in makes some sense to those that happen to read it, because the scouring of Google, and forum after forum for answers has grown tiresome, which is why I now turn to this highly knowledgeable and collaborative community for help.  I do consider myself to be technically skilled, and have learned a lot more about this stuff than I ever wanted to know, but it is all worth it's weight in gold to me, including my new found love and appreciation using Terminal...who knew! ;-)\nLet me thank you all in advance for any and all help, tips, pointers, etc. that come my way...they are all very much appreciated.  I hope that this, being my first post, is fomatted and worded in the way that is preferred by this community, and has provided enough detail, thought and questions to garner some initial input, \nMerry Christmas,\nJimmy\n\nA: This sort of infection is extremely rare in the OS X world. Getting reinfected over and over again is  even less likely. Not saying it's impossible, but very unlikely. \nI would start by installing Little Snitch and setting it to monitor outgoing connections. Also monitor your launchd folders using http://www.circl.lu/pub/tr-08/\nThe first step I would recommend is changing all of your passwords and using something like 1password so your ex can't get into something again. \nMarking this as a wiki so others can add suggestions since this isn't an \"answer\" per se. \n[2013-04-14: There's also Radio Silence which is an outbound filter like Little Snitch but supposedly simpler and less \"chatty\".]\n\nA: Unless something kinky is going on (and whenever an ex might be involved, the potential kinkiness increases), the Mac OS X Base System is the hidden \"recovery partition\" your Mac uses to store the essential core replicating booting from the install CD in the old days, by holding Command+R during boot. From here you can do an internet reinstall or run Disk Utility. You can read more about it here http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4718.\nThis post might not get a second look if today was April 1, but what you described leads me to repeat one of my long-held beliefs: Just because you're paranoid doesn't mean they're not out to get you.\nA couple of questions to get you thinking:\n\n\n*\n\n*How is your network configured?\n\n*\n\n*Internet--> gateway--> WiFi router --> computers\n\n*Internet--> gateway/WiFi router--> computers\n\n\n*If you have a combined gateway/WiFi router, did your DSL or Internet company provide this?\n\n*Who installed your Internet gateway/wireless router?\n\n*What brand is the router?\n\n*Did your ex use any remote management accounts or VPN to access your home systems?\n\n*Did you have the OS X firewall enabled prior to this mess?\n\n*Are there any \"mystery devices\" that show up on your network subnet? Before you shut down your current router, check its list of attached devices. Can you identify every device on that list? Wondering if your ex might have left something behind for gaining access.\n\n*Are their any strange devices that attach to your computers (either the Mac or Windows machine?) Looking for key loggers here.\n\n*Have you seen any anomalies with credit cards or bank statements?\n\n*If this continues, are you willing to file a police report?\n\n\nRemember that any security modifications you make to your Mac you'll want to make analogous changes to your Vista laptop.\nHere is a good start procedures to block something nefarious from happening. Don't be alarmed at the length or complexity of this post. Many of these items are straightforward once you are in the router/gateway configuration utility.\n\n\n*\n\n*Reset all your passwords: routers, computers, email, banks, management accounts, etc. Get and install a password manager like 1Password and use it to create \"hideously long and complex passwords\" (either long, randomly generated collections of UPPER+lower-alphanumerics or multi-word sentences of gibberish--the longer the better).\n\n*Reinstall OS X while attached to a different network: at a friend's house, Starbucks, the library, etc. make sure you apply all needed patches to your system before you bring the computer home.\n\n*Upgrade your Windows laptop to Windows 7 or 8. Both these Microsoft OSs have a better security subsystem than Vista. Regardless of OS version, be sure to stay up to date on security patches.\n\n*Use a firewall. Either the native OS X firewall or Little Stitch as TJLumona suggests. \n\n*Turn off the guest accounts on all your computers.\n\n*Go hardwired for a short while. Turn WiFi off at your router. Turn WiFi off on both computers. Run cable to your computers... and if you can, run this way for a week or so. If nothing weird happens in this time, you might have shut off your ex's access.\n\n*Enable your router's firewall. Turn off all but the minimally required ports to shut down any outside access through your router. If your ex is as powerful as you say, you might want to replace the router.\n\n*Enable access logs on your router and/or gateway. Look for anyone attempting to gain access via both the Internet and via WiFi.\n\n*Configure a white-list of devices allowed on your network. Do this on your WiFi router and Internet gateway,using the MAC address you read from the Physical device. While this isn't a perfect blockade, it's one more layer of defense. \n\n*Periodically monitor the devices attached to your network. With a white list you shouldn't see anything except what you've allowed, but worth checking nonetheless. If your ex is spoofing a MAC address, you can potentially spot it by powering down all your devices and making sure they disappear from your network.\n\n*Build a timed-access list on your network. (or turn off your gateway and/or router) Disallow network and/or WiFi access by time based on MAC address. If no one is home during the day, or if no one is awake at night, no one needs to use the network... including unauthorized people.\n\n\nGood luck \"locking your door\".\n", "Q: Turn off blurring on Mac Book Pro with Retina display I think it's already known issue that old applications look blurry on the new retina display, but some look ok, just worse quality. As an example I want you too look on the image below:\n\nIt's clearly visible that an upper text uses squares of 2x2 pixels as a one big (non hi-res) pixel. And the image below is 'blurred' so each pixel has it's own color an this allows smother gradients, but for me it's harder to look at the blurred text. So does anybody know if there is a possibility to turn off this blurring and see pixels just 4 times larger?\n\nA: Alright, it looks like you just have to check \"Open in low resolution\" check box in application information.\nSo select an app, press Cmd+I (or got to File > Get info) and check the \"Open in low resolution\" check box as shown below:\n\nNow everything should look crisp\n\nA: The blurring is an effect of subpixel rendering.\nThe easiest way to get rid of it is to uncheck \"Use LCD font smoothing when available\" in General section of the System Preferences. (keep in mind - this will affect retina-enabled applications too)\nSometimes you can disable it on per-application basis. The best case scenario is when antialiasing can be disabled in application preferences.\nIf this option is not available, adjusting \"AppleAntiAliasingThreshold\" in Info.plist can help.\n", "Q: How can I completely remove Apple's Java 6 and make Oracle's Java 7 default for everything? I would like to completely remove Apple's Java 6 and make Oracle's Java 7 default for every program.\nFor example, with Eclipse I had to fiddle with eclipse.ini to specify JAVA_HOME for Java 7, and the same for TunnelBear. No luck for Aptana, though (it still wants Apple's Java)\nIs there a way to make Oracle's Java default in terms of PATH?\n\nA: Download and install the latest Java Development Kit (JDK) from Oracle, which will place it in /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.7.0_11.jdk (or whatever the latest version is). Now, start Terminal.app, and enter the following commands:\n\n\n*\n\n*cd /System/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines (change to the proper directory)\n\n*sudo mv 1.6.0.jdk backup.1.6.0.jdk (keep the old JDK around, just in case - you will need to have an administrator password to do this)\n\n*sudo ln -s /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.7.0_11.jdk 1.6.0.jdk (link your new JDK installation to where applications expect the old one to be)\nKeep in mind that with any further jdk updates, you'll need to update the symlink to the new directory: \nsudo rm /System/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/1.6.0.jdk && sudo ln -s /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/new_jdk_version /System/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/1.6.0.jdk\n\n\nA: These instructions worked well for me on OS X Mavericks.\n\n\n*\n\n*Remove Apple's JVMs\n$ sudo rm -rf /System/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/\n\n\n*Remove installer records\n$ sudo rm /private/var/db/receipts/com.apple.pkg.JavaForMacOSX*\n\n\n*Remove installer receipts (delete the <dict>...</dict> entries that reference com.apple and java)\n$ sudo emacs /Library/Receipts/InstallHistory.plist\n\n\n*Set the symlinks for Java 7\n$ sudo rm /usr/bin/java\n$ sudo ln -s /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.7.0_17.jdk/Contents/Home/bin/java /usr/bin/java\n\n\n*Optionally symlink JAVA_HOME\nsudo rm /Library/Java/Home\nsudo ln -s /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.7.0_17.jdk/Contents/Home /Library/Java/Home\n\n\nA: Well, if you install the latest Java update from Apple, that should actually uninstall Java 6. You can go to Oracle's website directly to download Java 7. That's what I did. With only Java 7 on your system, that should make it default.\n\nA: I know this is an old thread, but if one has Adobe CS5 on their machine, it MUST HAVE the Apple 1.6 version of java for the suite to run. I was running Eclipse which needed 1.7 or higher. I thought it would replace the Apple version, but it didn't. The Apple version is in the System/Library folder and the Oracle version is in the Library folder.\nThought I would add a bit more info for those who may need this information.\nOS X Lion\n", "Q: How can I fix smart playlists with live updating to update again in itunes 11? I'm using iTunes 11.0.1 on 64-bit Windows 7, and occasionally my smart playlists (with live updating set to on) stop updating.\nI've got a series of podcasts subscribed to via iTunes, and I have a smart playlist to collect all the newest ones I haven't yet heard, and play them in the order of publication ('Release date'). This has worked for me since iTunes 7 IIRC.\nWith the latest version of iTunes, occasionally this automatic updating stopped working.\nI tried switching off and on the 'live updating', restarting iTunes in between. No luck.I copied the playlist, and the copy showed the same stale set of podcasts, not the newer ones I verified existed.I changed the filter settings for the smart playlist, but no change.\nI have the same issue with a smart playlist for 'music' (in this case, podcasts downloaded as regular MP3s, where iTunes doesn't recognize them as podcasts but as music, where I filter-out 'songs' I've already heard at least once).\nWhen I recreate the smart playlist from scratch, it has been working again, for a time, but my main playlist has stopped updating now for at least the fourth time since iTunes 11 came out. I'd not consider that acceptable.\nGoogling this issue has not brought any usable answer, most people seem to have a problem that the smart playlist in iTunes is not properly synced to their device.Syncing is not my problem, just that the synced playlist is just as stale as in iTunes.\nIs there a way to get smart playlists with live updating to work again, or is this a bug for which I have to wait on Apple to fix it? Or might it be a problem with my Windows 7 installation?\n\nA: As a workaround I found out the following: If I switch off 'live updating', then sync my iPod, terminate iTunes, disconnect my iPod, restart iTunes again, and switch playlists, I can switch on 'live updating' again, and it seems to work.\nIf then (after \"fixing\" one playlist) I go to a different 'live updating' playlist, I just disable, then enable the 'live updating', and the playlist seems to work again.\nThis is very tedious, but better than recreating the playlist from scratch every time.\nI'd be very interested in hearing other experiences.\n", "Q: Web clipper for Ipad While browsing on my Ipad2 we'd like to take notes and save whole websites (not just bookmark them). The Evernote add-on on Chrome (on my PC) gives the exact functionality that I'm looking for. Is there an equivalent app for Ipad? Note that for a special accessibility reason we use Chrome instead of Safari. Thank you.\n\nA: I just discovered a reasonable way to add the Evernote bookmarklet to Chrome on my iPad.\n\n\n*\n\n*Start to create a new bookmark on any page by clicking the star in the URL bar\n\n*Enter a name for the bookmarklet. I just used Evernote.\n\n*Delete the URL in the bookmark dialog box and replace with the Evernote bookmarklet:\njavascript:(function(){EN_CLIP_HOST='http://www.evernote.com';try{var%20x=document.createElement('SCRIPT');x.type='text/javascript';x.src=EN_CLIP_HOST+'/public/bookmarkClipper.js?'+(new%20Date().getTime()/100000);document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0].appendChild(x);}catch(e){location.href=EN_CLIP_HOST+'/clip.action?url='+encodeURIComponent(location.href)+'&title='+encodeURIComponent(document.title);}})();\n\n\n*Save the bookmark\nNow if you type the name of the bookmark Chrome should show an autocomplete list with the Javascript code — just select it and press Return.

(I'm from Italy)\nHowever I talked with two guys at the Apple Store and they told me\n\n\n*\n\n*The iPad is not going to work in Italy because of different processors. I don't believe it.\n\n*The iPad is going to work but the wireless device is different, hence you will have trouble in case of damage because the iPad bought in US is technically different from the one we sell in Italy.\n\n\nAre 1 and/or 2 true?\nWill I found problem with the warranty in case of need?\n\nA: I've never heard of someone being refused AppleCare service at an Apple Retail store in Europe when the product was purchased in the US. Also, all 2012 mini Wi-Fi models are A1432 so you don't need to play a guessing game with LTE bands.\nIf you read the terms of the warranty, Apple is certainly in their rights to ask you to return the product to the country of sale for service since that is their standard practice. You are basically selecting the laws and customs that cover your warranty and perhaps giving up some rights since European law is different than US law in terms of consumer protection.\nIn reality, most countries that have Apple Retail presence have good coverage for US products whether you take it to a local authorized center or to Apple. You might have second thoughts if you lived somewhere where the local distributor expects to provide service to products it sold and not those you imported yourself.\nAs to the quotes - perhaps they were unfamiliar with WiFi bands and that Apple devices usually will reprogram the baseband for WiFi based on location and not point of purchase.\n\nA: Apple has based its empire on manufacturing efficiencies. Unless there is a specific reason for Apple to produce hardware for a specific countries, Apple builds world devices. Recent exceptions have been for cell carriers, and even here Apple has dictated terms more than almost any other manufacturer. \nOne possible question to ask is how Apple would handle warranty repair for a US iPad mini for someone who moved to Italy or was living there for an extended time.\nYou might need to replace the US-spec plug on the 12V charger. Otherwise, I cannot see there being a difference between equipment nationalities.\n\nA: You'll save money and keep a comprehensive warranty if you buy an iPad back in Italy, since Italian law mandates manufacturers provide 2-years of replacement/support of goods, you don't have to spring for Applecare in order to have sufficient warranty coverage.\nStandard terms in America are 30 days to return a product, 90 days phone support, and 1 year repair/replacement.\n\nA: For WiFi model, You can buy it from Apple Store everywhere. Hardware should be the same. But for cellular model, you may send it back to US for repair. \n", "Q: How to interpret outcome of Apple Hardware Test on Malfunctioning Macbook-Pro/Snow Leopard Here are some tests I have when I ran Apple Hardware Test from original Tiger install disc.\nMy issue is recurrent worsening inconsistent kernel panics.  \nThe Hardware Test hangs up at 35 seconds, while \"testing memory.\"  The first time I ran it I didn't realize it had hung up till I looked over the display after 3 or 4 minutes. It showed \"Detected Error\" and a code, but shut down as I scrambled for a pencil to write it down.  I then ran it 3 more times, but each time the system shut down sometime between 35 seconds and the appearance of the error code.  \n\n\n*\n\n*Can I deduce anything useful from this?  \n\n*Can I force the Hardware Test to tell me anything more?\n\n\nA: I'm not sure if there's a way to get more information out of the Hardware Test (although I would suggest taking a picture of the screen if you're not able to write all the info down in time). However the symptoms you describe suggest that there's a problem with your memory — either the sticks themselves, or the memory controller.\nI would suggest taking out your memory, then trying these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Run the AHT with one memory DIMM only. Repeat with the same DIMM in the other slot.\n\n*Repeat the above, but with the other DIMM.\n\n*If neither of those work, try a known good DIMM from another machine, or a new one.\n\n\nIf you find that one stick works but the other doesn't, it's likely that you have a bad stick — replacing it should solve your problem. Likewise if new RAM works but the existing doesn't.\nIf you find that one slot works but the other doesn't, then you likely have a logic board or memory controller issue.\nFinally, if none of those combinations work, it could be a logic board or memory controller issue, or something else.\nSorry I can't be more definitive, but hopefully that will help you to narrow it down.\n\nA: When you can't get a hardware test to run to completion, that's a good sign you need a repair. When it sometimes logs an error and sometimes it completes without an error, things are harder to guess, but your Mac is clearly not even running well enough to finish some basic tests of functionality. \n\nThe detailed AHT result codes and triage steps are not published by Apple except to trained / authorized technicians, so the obvious thing to do would be to call one and ask for a quote.\nThey may want you to relay the results or they may prefer to run the tests themselves since it might take more time to pore over your results / check your work than to do an estimate by their trained techs.\nWhen the system can't even complete a hardware test without powering off, it's most likely not the memory since you could pull all RAM and repeat the test with only one memory in one slot and perhaps try a second memory in another slot in case you feared one receptacle or one chipset was horribly damaged and bringing the entire Mac down.\n", "Q: Make middle-click on app icon in dock show app window exposé once more In earlier versions of OS X (Snow Leopard, maybe?), middle-click on an open application's icon in the Dock would have the same effect as right-click -> show all windows.\nIn (Mountain) Lion, this is no longer the case.

I'd like to be able to play each flash movie individually, and even copy only the specific ones I want to take with me. This means that simply making an ISO image of the CD-ROM, is also not sufficient.\nI can't seem to find the media files themselves.

How can I copy out the media files themselves, other than screen-capturing them while they play back in realtime?\nPlease note:  I'm not looking for information on how to download flash files from a website. This has nothing to do with any web page, this is specifically about extracting flash files from a standalone, self-contained player application.\n\nA: You can use File Juicer. It is a very good program. I am using it since 2005. It works flawlessly. It will extract audio, video, doc, flash everything and keep them in separate folders.\nhttp://echoone.com/filejuicer/\n\nA: User @patrix gave this suggestion which turned out to be exactly what I needed:  Running ‘find /Volumes/NAME-OF-CD -print‘ in Terminal will give you a list of all accessible content.\n\nA: There are quite a few apps for this.

Rather, it is a large set of JPEG images (stop motion animation film). The images are 773 x 515 pixels, and very high quality.

You can also try compression quality after you have set a high data rate.\n\nA: I had problems with the terrible export quality of imovie. The only thing I have found that works is to export to iTunes. This gives great quality but will be an mov file. Then you just drag out of iTunes onto your desktop and use any number of programs to convert it to what you like (handbrake?). Mov files are fine for my use.

After replacing the harddisk drive in MacBook Pro  with a Solid State Disk I am wondering which settings I should change and how. \nThinking of things that are supposed to protect the SSD like\n\n\n*\n\n*enabling TRIM support\n\n*disabling suspend to disk\n\n*disabling the shock sensor (if no standard harddrive is used anymore - does that make sense at all?)\n\n\nUpdate:\nSwapping the harddrive with a SSD was just the best decision - totally different, much better experience, almost like a new, much faster MacBook Pro. \n\nA: I installed a 256GB SSD into my first generation 17\" unibody MacBook Pro a couple of years ago, before there was a third-party trim option. Since then, I've only gotten three speeding tickets for my computer being as fast or faster than the current machines.\nThe third-party SSD Trim Enabler has been the only change I've made to accommodate the SSD. \nYou may still want to keep the suspend to disk for hibernation ability. However, if your SSD is >really< small, disabling STD will free up drive space equivalent to the amount of RAM in your laptop.\nI see no benefit from disabling the shock sensor.\nEnjoy your much faster MBP!\n\nA: Depends on what type of SSD you have. Some SSDs have a TRIM facility built into the firmware of the SSD — Sandforce controllers in particular have this. The Samsung 830 series have in-built garbage collection which renders TRIM unnecessary.\nI have a Samsung 830 and have not modified a single thing. Runs great.\n\nA: Here you are some major points: \n\n\n*\n\n*Reinstall your Mountain Lion.\n\n*Don’t run benchmarks on your new SSD\n\nBenchmarks usually write a lot of data to the disk (to test the write\n  speed), wearing it out. So it is the best way how you can ruin your\n  SSD even before you start using it. Don’t do it.\n\n\n*Enable TRIM\n\nOS X supports TRIM only for Apple-supplied SSD’s. If you want to have TRIM enabled with 3-rd party SSD drives - download Trim enabler from this site. Very experienced users may want to enable trim manually not using above mentioned enabler, here is the tutorial how it can be done by the hand.\n\n\n*Turn off local Time Machine snapshots [laptops only]\n\nThere is no GUI switch to turn these local backups off, but it can easily be done on the command line. Just start Terminal.app and execute the following command: sudo tmutil disablelocal if you want to back to original settings use sudo tmutil enablelocal command \n\n\n*Turn off hibernation [laptops only]\n\nOS X saves all the memory to disk when entering sleep mode.The more RAM you have, the more gigabytes it writes to the disk every time you close the lid/put it to sleep. You can disable this feature via sudo pmset -a hibernatemode 0 command\n\n\n*Set noatime flag\n\nOS X by default records last access time for every file.  Every time you read a file, a write is made on the filesystem to record this action. There is no point in doing it and no side effects if you disable that by mounting the root filesystem with noatime flag set.  You can read more about it here and here:\n\n\n*Move user home directories to HDD [SSD+HDD only]\n\nThis is only useful if you have both SSD as well as HDD in your Mac. You can move all the content of /Users folder to the HDD and create symbolic link from the SSD to it by running this 3 commands: \n  sudo ditto /Users /Volumes/your_hdd_name/Users\n  sudo mv /Users /Users.bak\n  sudo ln -s /Volumes/your_hdd_name/Users /Users\n\n\n*Turn off sudden motion sensor [no HDD only]\n\nIf SSD is the only drive in your Mac, there is no point in using the Sudden Motion Sensor. You can turn it off by  sudo pmset -a sms 0\n\n\n*Turn off hard drive sleep [no HDD only]\n\n\nSome websites mention SSD may freeze when the hard drive sleep feature is on, so it is recommended to turn it off.

Whenever you try to copy an HTML table to the pasteboard, it will select by row. Sometimes, I'd like to select by columns. Is there a way to do this? If not out of the box, any extensions that enable this kind of functionality.\n\nA: As far as I know, there's no way to do that in Safari or Chrome, but in Firefox you can select ranges of cells by holding option and command.\n\nYou could also copy the whole table and paste it to a spreadsheet application or use something like pbpaste | cut -d $'\\t' -f3. But it might not work if there are cells that contain br elements or rows that start with empty cells.\nI've had to use something like this with a few tables that contained br elements:\nruby -e '`pbpaste`.scan(/<tr>.*?<\\/tr>/m).each { |r| puts r.scan(/<td>(.*?)<\\/td>/m)[2] }'\n\n", "Q: How can I selectively share app purchases among iOS devices using iCloud? I have three iOS 6 devices among which I would like to selectively share apps. I have an iPhone and my wife has an iPhone and an iPad. I understand that by using a common Apple ID for the App Store, we can purchase apps once and use them on all three devices; no problem there. However, I'd like to be able to manage things in a slightly more advanced way, if possible. Here's what I would like to happen:\n\n\n*\n\n*If my wife purchases an app on her iPhone, it will automatically download to her iPad, and vice versa.\n\n*If my wife purchases an app on one of her devices, I don't want it to automatically download to mine, and vice versa. While there might be a lot of software that we might want to share, there's also a significant amount of content that we won't want in common. I would like the sharing of these apps to be a more manual process (i.e. after I purchase an app, she could go to the App Store and choose to download it to her device(s)).\n\n*In my experience, using iTunes for managing multiple devices in this way is a bit clunky, so I would like to have a no-computer-in-the-loop approach. Notably, I have seen other questions that suggest using iTunes Home Sharing to share applications among different devices. It's not clear that this is a fit for my situation, as I don't have multiple computers, only multiple iOS devices.\nI'm not sure whether this sort of setup is possible. As a start, I have set up a common Apple ID for our store purchases and separate iCloud accounts for my wife and I, allowing us to segregate our backups. I'm not sure whether it's feasible to achieve the selective automatic synchronization between devices that I'm looking for; I was hoping that iCloud would allow this.\n\nA: Use one apple id.\nUnder Settings -> \"Store\" on your wifes iPad and iPhone.\nSet Automatic Downloads for Apps to On.\nOn your iPhone, under the Store settings, turn your Automatic downloads of Apps to Off.\nThis method will work the easiest, and will work for all situations besides your vice versa ... you purchase an app on your iPhone and it downloads to her devices.  There is no computer in the loop... her process isn't manual, it is automatic, but she can easily click and hold the icon and then delete it.\n", "Q: All my music has been deleted off my phone, and I don't know how to get it back! I put all my music on a playlist seperate from the rest of the music on the iTunes library, so I could easily get to what music I wanted to listen to, instead of my brother or sister's music. My brother recently got an iPod nano, and didn't know how to use iTunes, after explaining it to him, he deleted my whole entire playlist. I didn't know, so when I hooked my phone up to the computer to sync some songs I was going to buy, all the music on my phone disappeared. I've tried re-doing the playlist and syncing all of it to my phone again, but it won't work. I've also tried turning off my phone for certain periods of time, still nothing. \nI lost about 200 songs (thankfully not more), and I don't know how to get it back.\n\nA: If your brother deleted the songs themselves they are gone unless your computer is backed up. \nIf your brother just deleted the playlist you need to recreate the playlist and then re-sync it.  Here is a how to article on how to do that. - http://www.ehow.com/how_2214496_sync-playlists-iphone.html\n", "Q: Game Center Set Up OSX Mountain Lion I'm trying to play a game that I just bought that uses the Game Center on OS X Mountain Lion. This is the first time I have a game that uses the Game Center. I'm able to log in with my Apple ID. It asks me to set up my Game Center account. I choose create a nickname and I check the tick-boxes if I want want my profile public or not and to add my contacts. After I click continue I get a window that says saving but it never saves, never gives an error message. How do I get this to work?\n\nA: I was having the exact same problem. I was picking my true nickname (lizzie) and it just kept spinning and spinning and never would save. So, I decided to try a nickname I KNEW no one would have (my name spelled backwards). It saved immediately. Maybe your nickname is too common? Try something truly unique. Hope that works for you.\n\nA: I had exactly the same problem. I tried one nickname but the cursor just kept spinning and the screen said \"saving...\". I then tried a very uncommon nickname that I was pretty sure no one else had and the signing in worked. Apple needs to fix this signing in process so that GC tells you that a nickname is already used rather than going round and round.\n", "Q: How to keep two Macs in sync? \nPossible Duplicate:\nCompletely synchronise multiple Macs \n\nI've got a MacBook Pro and a Mac Mini, and I want to keep them in sync: all files and folders, all settings, all everything. \nHere's what I know won't work: Dropbox, iCloud.\nHere's what I know might work: install Mountain Lion Server on the Mac Mini as my \"main\" computer in an admin account, then use that to create a separate network account / portable home directory / mobile users / something like that, then make that account the default one on my MacBook Pro. \nThe problem is that I have absolutely no clue how to do this and I'd like to get some help. \nI'm aware that I may have to use a few different things to do the full sync - like setting up OS X server to do most of the work, but still using Dropbox for certain files and something like Chronosync for others.\nPlease tell me where to start.\n\nA: Have you tried Carbon Copy Cloner (http://www.bombich.com)? it has a sync feature that may help you.\n", "Q: Installing VMware on MacBook - Free version I need to install Windows 8 on my MacBook. So I am hoping to install VMware and then install Windows 8 on top of it.\nI need to know if I need to install VMware Player or VMware Fusion? I am using this for non-commercial use so I require a free version.\nNote: VMware Fusion is a licensed version, and I don't want to use it.\n\nA: VMware Player is only avaiable for Windows and Linux, not OS X. To install Windows 8 on your Mac, you will need to purchase VMware Fusion.\nFrom VMware Workstation Player (formerly known as Player Pro):\n\nVMware Player is the easiest way to run multiple operating systems at the same time on your PC.\n\nYou do have a couple of free options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Virtualbox is a free program that will allow you to install Windows 8 alongside OS X in the same way that VMware Fusion works (you can run both OSs concurrently).\n\n*Apple's own Boot Camp software will allow you to install Windows in a separate partition. The downside to this is you have to reboot your computer to switch between OSs, but the upside is that you can run more graphically-intense programs (i.e. games) at native speeds.\n\n", "Q: Quickly browse through different available Wireless networks for the iPhone? I was wondering if there is a Cydia App or some other way that provides a way to browse and choose different available networks in a very fast manner ?\nI hate going through Settings > Wi-Fi > Network - I would rather have a drop down list from notification center or something similar.\nAny suggestions ?\n\nA: As fas as I know, there is only a concept video for Notification Center WiFi seleciton, and there is a Simple Wifi for Notification Center Cydia tweak that will show WiFi info in there, but I don't think there is actually something that gives you exactly what you want.\nBut really, it's just two taps. Settings icon > WiFi section. That shows you all available networks. If your current WiFi network goes off, a list of available networks will automatically pop up.\n", "Q: Why is the IP address to my MacBook Pro being zapped by another computer? This started two days ago and I can't decide if my MacBook is at fault, my router is at fault, or I have a hacker. My MBP will throw an error saying the IP address I've been using has been assigned to another machine and blah blah blah reset the router or contact my local admin. (Which is me; this is our home system.) I'll renew the DHCP license and the error immediately comes up again. Also happens if I am HARDWIRED to the router itself. (So if wi-if is on I get two errors simultaneously.) I tried changing my MAC address to something else, thinking it was a possibility the MAC address was being spoofed, but the problem continues. I have a linksys router and a cable modem. \nWe have three iPhone 4s's, two iPad 2's, and a Windows laptop or two (depending on whether he brings his work laptop home. We also have a few roku devices and two IP cameras (monitors for the kids' rooms). Oh, and the printer. I can see everything assigned to the router in the DHCP tables and never see the assignment of the old IP to another machine.  I tried pulling out an older linksys router and the behavior has not changed. Security is WPA2 with a 16-char string that I have not yet changed. (My weak point; it's a pain to update those cameras.)\nAny ideas? I'm not opposed to getting a new router if that's what it takes; I was prepping to do that later this morning anyway when stores open. But I'm afraid the new router will do the same thing. \nEdited to add: yesterday I also tried powering down some of our iThings. When all phones and tablets were powered down the problem seemed to go away. But then it returned with a vengeance so I powered them back up so we'd be able to communicate with the rest of the world.\n\nA: Once Macs are given a dynamic IP in a DHCP-based system they prefer to hold onto it at all costs, even with releasing/renewing. Check to make sure there are no static IP configurations for another computer that your Macbook is trying to use instead.\nIf there're no IP's configured statically then try resetting the router to default settings.\n\nA: I ended up replacing the router with an airport and so far no problem. Linksys tech support finally responded and guessed that the DHCP server was malfunctioning. No firmware upgrades were available so they were in the \"oh well, sux to be you\" camp.\n", "Q: Three displays with Mac Mini 2012 I've read on Tom's Hardware that Intel HD Graphics 4000 supports three displays. Is that information valid for 2012 Mac Minis too? Does anyone have any information on what the Mac Mini's capability is with regard to maximum number of displays, resolutions and port limitations?\nWith regard to display ports, what would a DisplayLink type of connection be categorised as?\n\nA: Three displays will not work in a supported, OS X only solution. You can use two thunderbolt attached displays or one HDMI and one thunderbolt. \nApple maintains a knowledge base article listing which Mac models support either one or two external thunderbolt displays.\n\n\n*\n\n*http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4885\nIn the section for OS X, the 2012 mini is listed in the category of two full monitors with a footnote explaining HDMI and thunderbolt. \n\nA: If your 2012 mini is anything like my previous generation one, three monitors would consist of displays on the following ports:\n\n\n*\n\n*HDMI (either straight out or using the HDMI-DVI converter\n\n*Thunderbolt: you'll need an actual Thunderbolt Display to daisy chain from\n\n*a second monitor running from #2. This could be either a second Thunderbolt display or via a mini DisplaPort connection\n\n\nWhile the name DisplayLink sounds confusingly like DisplayPort, the two have nothing in common. Display Link routs video over a USB connection. Display Port (in either its mini or full-size incarnation) is a monitor connection standard like VGA or DVI.\n", "Q: How to synchronize new Notes from iPad to Mac I upgraded my iTune to iTune 11, and no longer find the option to synchronize note. I do not like to use iCloud (no WiFI or Cellular), but cannot figure a way to synchronize (or download) the note on my iPad to my Mac's Note.app. \n\nA: According to Apple:\n\nYou can sync with the Notes app using IMAP or iCloud. Syncing Notes using iTunes is no longer supported on OS X v10.8 and later.\n\nThere may be a possibility that it could still work, as it is specifically mentioned later in the article:\n\nIf you want to sync notes with iTunes instead of using the over-the-air feature, disable Notes sync for the account using Settings > Mail, Contacts, Calendars or Settings > iCloud.\n\nThough when I disabled Notes on the iPad, then synced to iTunes, the info pane never showed Notes as an option. I would perform the following steps to give it a fair shot:\n\n\n*\n\n*On the iPad -> Settings -> iCloud - disable notes\n\n*On the iPad -> Settings -> Mail, Contacts, Calendars - make sure no other service is using Notes\n\n*On the Mac -> Notes -> Accounts - make sure Notes is turned off in all accounts. \n\n\nAccording to the documentation, this should force iTunes to recognize that no sync options are available and provide some option to sync Notes, but it didn't \"just work\" for me.\n\nA: You can sync Notes between arbitrary devices using any IMAP mail account, like  Gmail. If you enable Notes for the corresponding account on all devices you have wireless notes synching.\n\nA: Based on @brockangelo's answer, it seems there is no offline mechanism to automatically sync new notes from your iPad to your Mac.\nHowever, there may be a way to transfer existing notes. The app \"Notebooks for iPad\" supports importing from the Notes app, as well as iTunes File Sharing. This means (in theory) you could import your notes into the Notebooks app, and then put them on your Mac via your iPhone's \"Apps\" tab in iTunes.\nFrom there, you could copy and paste them into Notes.app on your Mac, use an AppleScript to import them, or use the files directly.\n\nAdditional notes: I had never heard of the Notebooks app before researching this answer. I have not tried this method; it is only a concept. I searched a community-built compilation of iOS text editors, and found no other iPad apps that support both features. Yes, this answer suggests a dirty workaround, and it should be avoided if possible.\n", "Q: Disable automatic \"overview scan\" in Image Capture I have two scanners accessible from my machine (using Lion): a USB flatbed scanner, and a multifunction network printer. Whenever I launch Image Capture (either directly, or indirectly from Preview), it selects the first scanner (USB) and runs an \"overview scan\". Whenever I change the selected scanner (e.g. from the USB scanner to the multifunction printer), an \"overview scan\" is performed again.\nThis automatic overview is irksome:\n\n\n*\n\n*It is slow and takes several seconds.\n\n*It is noisy.\n\n*Most of the time, it is totally useless (especially when I want to use the \"document feeder\" of the multifunction printer, since then the overview is done with the flatbed source of the printer, so I get a blank overview).\n\n*There is a nice \"overview\" button that I perfectly know how to click, if I really want an overview.\n\n\nIs there a way to deactivate this automatic overview scan ?\n\nA: If you (remember to) set the scan mode to document feeder, it won't do the overview.\n\nA: Apple's Image Capture app is intentionally minimalist. It doesn't have significant Preference settings, and no user-friendly way to turn off the overview scan.\nIn theory, anything in OS X is hackable, given sufficient knowledge and time. In practice, you should consider a 3rd party scanner app instead.\n", "Q: How can I back up my OSX 10.6 Installation DVD and create a bootable USB drive? I have a MacBook Pro mid 2009, It came with two DVDs: Application Install DVD and OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard) Installation DVD.\nSince DVDs have a short life, I want to back up these two DVDs (Especially the OS X Installation DVD).\nHow can I clone these DVDs? Or even better, can I clone them on a bootable USB Drive?\n\nA: Well, here are a few things: \n1) That OS X installation disk (10.6), will only install Snow Leopard for your 2009 MBP\nYou cannot use that disk for OS X installs on other machines\n2) Generally, the applications disk is nearly useless. Your milage may vary, but I've never, ever used them. \n3) Obviously your external drive (USB you say?) will have to have enough space to boot the \ninstallation process. I'd recommend 8+ GB if you will actually use this thing. However, you will only need a usb drive as large as the disk image file that we will create later on.\n\nSo, lets get started. There are probably guides out there that have more comprehensive answers than this, but I digress.\nYou need to use Disk Utility for the following steps. It should be in your Utilities folder. Put the OS X install disk into your Macbook, while your USB drive is also in the computer.\n\n\n*\n\n*Wipe your USB drive, and reformat it as Mac OS Journaled\n\n*Create a disk image of the CD, saving it to your computer's hard drive.\n\n*Once you have created the disk image, it should be on the left pane of the Disk Utility window. Click on it, then select the 'Restore' tab to the right. You will want the Source to be the disk image file (the OS X install disk), and the Target to be the USB drive.\n\n\nLet me know how it goes!\nCharlie \n", "Q: How do I improve my performance of my MBP (2009) after upgrading to 10.8.2 I'm relatively a novice when it comes to computers. I recently upgraded my MBP to the new OS X 10.8.2 and noticed that it's running much slower now.  I purchased this laptop in the summer of 2009. Here are the basic specs:\nMacbook Pro 13-inch, (mid-2009)\nProcessor 2.26 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo\nMemory 2 GB 1067 MHz DDR3\nGraphics NVIDIA GeForce 9400M 256 MB\nSATA Disk 160GB\n\nAny recommendations on how to boost its performance would be greatly appreciated. I would love to avoid purchasing a new laptop, unless needed.\n\nA: I have the same MacBook Pro model.\nUpgrading your RAM to 8 GB will help a lot, as the others suggested. You might also look into adding an SSD using something like the Data Doubler by Other World Computing (macsales.com).\nThen you could do something cool like this: http://reviews.cnet.com/8301-13727_7-57550128-263/how-to-make-a-custom-corestorage-drive-in-os-x/\n\nA: Tho Apple lists 2GB RAM as the minimum requirement for Mountain Lion it is not really enough in my opinion.\nApps like Safari, Chrome, Photoshop are all going to grab all your free RAM in order to boost their own performance at the expense of other operations.\nYou can confirm that you are RAM constrained by opening Activity Monitor and looking at \"Page outs\" in the \"System Memory\" Tab.\nIf you are seeing any number other than zero then your computer at one point since the last reboot had to swap memory to disk.  This is going to slow your machine considerably while the swap is occurring and slow it again when the same memory is later pull back into RAM.\nSo first thing would I'd do is buy more RAM.  That should help a LOT.\nAfter that I'd look to getting a SSD, which should also improve battery life.  But RAM is the top priority here.\n\nA: Id suggest upgrading your RAM regardless of what OS you run.\nTwo upgrade kits from NewEgg: \n - 8GB http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820233215\n - 16GB http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820148607\nBoth of these upgrades use two SO-DIMMs. I know the 17\" MBP accepts 16GB, but I'm not 100% sure with the 13\".\nTo install them, \n\n\n*\n\n*completely power down your computer (shut down, not sleep or just lid close), \n\n*remove all the screws from the bottom panel, remembering the positions for the long screws\n\n*gently pop off the bottom plate\n\n*the RAM sockets are located in the center of the MacBook Pro, just above the battery. The installed DIMMs have metal clips, one on either side. Click them away from the DIMM and tilt the stick away from the laptop, pivoting around the contacts\n\n*repeat for the second stick. \n\n*Insert the new DIMMs in the opposite manner. \n\n*Snap the bottom panel into place\n\n*Boot the computer. If you hear any different chimes at startup, you didnt insert the RAM sticks correctly. Power down by holding the power button for 10 to 15 seconds. Open the bottom and reseat both DIMMs. Close and try again.\n\n*check About this Mac to make sure the new amount of RAM is recognized.\n\n\nA: Agreed. RAM upgrade/addition and an SSD will make that thing run way faster. I did that to my wife's MBP and it made a huge difference. Just bear in mind that SSD's are not cheap for higher volume drives. The one I ordered was a 256GB and it was around $200. So with that, the SSD drive will really only be used for the OS and any other software/apps that you want to put on it. We have a NAS that we push photos, documents, etc. to and then we use dropbox as well so that the drive doesn't get gobbed up with non-functioning files.\n", "Q: Are there any hidden settings to modify default system sleep conditions? Is it possible in some way to modify conditions when OS X will go to sleep? \nIn my opinion the time delay of system sleep is insufficient. \nImagine the situation that we are in the middle of downloading some large file over http, after leaving MBP for e.g. 4 min cause a system sleep therefore all tcp connections will be broken. It is not only anoying. \nThe caffeinate command can be used but it will implicit prevent OS X from sleeping.\nDoes anyone have cure for that? \n\nA: Applications that download files should create a power assertion to prevent idle sleep. But for ones that don't, you can add something like this to the crontab (EDITOR=nano crontab -e):\n* * * * * pgrep -x uTorrent && caffeinate -t 60\n\nYou haven't missed the energy saver settings, right?\n\n", "Q: iPad 3 not connecting to a cellular network at all My iPad 3 doesn't want to connect to my cellular network.

What could it be and what should we do?\n\nA: Which iOS version is installed? Did it ever work since you bought it? Have you updated the iOS since you own the iPad?\nYour description reminds me of my fahter's 2nd hand iPhone 3GS.

Or when I work with the uncompressed project in eclipse as it doesn't like them at all.\nI use 10.7.5.\n\nA: OS X's tar uses the AppleDouble format to store extended attributes and ACLs. tar and Archive Utility also know how to convert the ._ files back to the native formats, but the ._ files are kept if the archive is extracted on another platform or on a non-HFS volume.\nYou can usually just tell tar to remove the metadata by setting COPYFILE_DISABLE to some value:\n$ xattr -l file.jpg\ncom.apple.quarantine: 0002;50d20c48;Tweetbot;\n$ tar -cf 1.tar file.jpg \n$ tar -tf 1.tar \n./._file.jpg\nfile.jpg\n$ COPYFILE_DISABLE=1 tar -cf 2.tar file.jpg \n$ tar -tf 2.tar \nfile.jpg\n\nInformation stored as extended attributes:\n\n\n*\n\n*Resource forks (since 10.4)\n\n*\n\n*Custom icons set in Finder and the images of Icon\\r files\n\n*Metadata in PSD files\n\n*Script objects stored in scpt files, AppleScript Editor window state\n\n\n*Information about aliases\n\n*Quarantine status, download URLs\n\n*Spotlight comments\n\n*Encoding of files saved with TextEdit\n\n*Caret position of files saved with TextMate\n\n*Skim notes\n\n\nYou can see ACLs with ls -le:\n$ ls -led /Applications/\ndrwxrwxr-x@ 146 root  admin  4964 Jun 17 22:53 /Applications/\n 0: group:everyone deny delete\n\n\nA: Those files were always there, but they are invisible in Finder (and most Mac OS applications).  See https://superuser.com/questions/212896/\nedit \nThat is: these files contain the extended file attributes ... en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_file_attributes ... and they were created as soon as MacOS gave extended attributes to the files.

The time to search and replace went down from 1 hour+ to about five seconds.\n\nA: I usually use Text Wrangler (the free incarnation of the full featured BBEdit) for working on text files that are too large for other tools.\n", "Q: RAID questions with ML I'm looking to build a NAS box and putting ML on it.\nI currently have two drives that are configured as RAID one that I am pulling out of a NAS box.\nI have one drive that I'd like to add to the two already RAID drives, but I'm not sure if that's possible.\nAnd is it even possible to have one drive with data on it and then create a RAID with another diver without it removing/formatting the data that is currently on the main drive?\nNote: I currently have a D-Link 321 with 2 1TB drives in them set up as RAID 1. If I pull those out and put them into the new mac pro NAS, will the OS pick up that they are already RAID'ed together? And can I add my 1 3TB drive to the current RAID with the 2 1TB drives provided that the OS picks up on it?\n\nA: My initial reaction from how you staged your question: building a NAS from the ground up is a complex set of interrelated dependencies in both hardware, software and connectivity. You might be better off purchasing a ready-made or self-contained NAS unit.\nYou need to ask what you expect from a NAS: lots of storage or redundancy. The two-drive RAID you mention could be configured a couple of ways, and you may not be able to read the volume without the original RAID controller from the NAS.\nYour inquiry into starting with one drive then adding additional drives sounds like some JBOD (just a bunch of disks) setups. JBOD only offers los of storage, but no redundancy.\nRAID and NAS can both be elements of a storage solution, but in and of themselves, the two acronyms can also spell HEADACHE.\n\nA: OK, so ten years later... I eventually moved to unRAID in case anyone ever digs this up.\n", "Q: How to resize Macintosh HD? In my disk utilty, I have some unused space left over.\nI want to resize Macintosh HD to use this space.\nWhats the best way to resize Macintosh HD? Disk Utility won't let me resize it whether I'm live resizing from the tool running on my Mountain Lion install or if I boot into Recovery HD so the OS isn't running.\nHere is a screenshot of my Disk Utility window currently\n\n\nA: Please please make sure that you type in the correct partitions. Double-check and triple check before running the merge command. It’s really important that you backup all of your data. I’m not taking any responsibility if you manage to erase anything. You will not want to lose data if there’s a sudden loss of power mid-operation.\n\n\n*\n\n*In Disk Utility, create a new partition from the unused space.\n\n*Open terminal.app, and from there you’ll run diskutil mergePartitions\nFirst you need to find out which partitions you’ll want to merge:\ndisktuil list\n\nAnd hopefully you’ll see something like this:\n/dev/disk0\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *500.1 GB   disk0\n   1:                        EFI                         209.7 MB   disk0s1\n   2:                  Apple_HFS Macintosh HD            499.2 GB   disk0s2\n   3:                  Apple_HFS Untitled                 50.0 MB   disk0s3   \n   4:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s4\n\nYou’ll want to merge disk0s2 with disk0s3. So you’d run something like this:\ndiskutil mergePartitions JHFS+ DiskName disk0s2 disk0s3\n\nBeware that the above will merge partitions between disk0s2 and disk0s3. Data on disk0s2 is preserved, data on all the partitions in-between is erased. In my example the two partitions are contiguous so there’s no problem. But if your recovery partition is in between it will be erased.\nIf you need help with the mergePartitions command:\n\nUsage:  diskutil mergePartitions [force] format name\n          DiskIdentifier|DeviceNode DiskIdentifier|DeviceNode\nMerge two or more pre-existing partitions into one.  The first disk\n  parameter is the starting partition; the second disk parameter is the\n  ending partition; this given range of two or more partitions will be\n  merged into one.\nAll partitions in the range, except for the first one, must be\n  unmountable.\nAll data on merged partitions other than the first will be lost; data\n  on the first partition will be lost as well if the \"force\" argument is\n  given.\nIf \"force\" is not given, and the first partition has a resizable file\n  system (e.g. JHFS+), it will be grown in a data-preserving manner,\n  even if a different file system is specified (in fact, your file\n  system and volume name parameters are both ignored in this case). If\n  \"force\" is not given, and the first partition is not resizable, you\n  will be prompted if you want to erase.\nIf \"force\" is given, the first partition is always formatted. You\n  should do this if you wish to reformat to a new file system type.\nMerged partitions are required to be ordered sequentially on disk. See\n  diskutil list for the actual on-disk ordering; BSD slice identifiers\n  may in certain circumstances not always be in numerical order but the\n  top-to-bottom order given by diskutil list is always the on-disk\n  order.\nOwnership of the affected disk is required.\nExample: diskutil mergePartitions JHFS+ NewName disk3s4 disk3s7\n           This example will merge all partitions BETWEEN disk3s4 and disk3s7,\n           preserving data on disk3s4 but destroying data on disk3s5, disk3s6,\n           disk3s7 and any invisible free space partitions between those disks;\n           disk3s4 will be grown to cover the full space if possible.\n\n\nA: This is typically the result of the Macintosh HD being a core storage partition and not a standard partition that sits directly in the partition table.\nIf you have turned on FileVault - this will convert your Mac to use Core Storage. You can also type the command in terminal to see whether my guess is correct: diskutil cs list\nIf you don't have Core Storage set up and have this inability to resize a volume, then something is amiss with the volume structure, as you should see a window like this:\n\nIf this doesn't do the trick comment or edit in what diskutil list shows on the problematic Mac and there could be an easy command line solution to resizing things as well.\n\nA: OK Everyone! I've finally got around to fixing my Mac! For future reference, here is how I did it!\nFirstly, I redownloaded the Mountain Lion installer from the App Store (as it is a digital download now) by holding Option and clicking 'Purchases' to make it appear (after reading a forum online).\nAfter doing this, I created a new blank partition on my spare drive ready to create my own bootable Mac OS Mountain Lion installer.\nNext, I downloaded a free app called 'Lion DiskMaker 2' (http://liondiskmaker.com) which took my installer and create a bootable drive out of it using my blank partition.\nAfter that I created a Time Machine backup.\nThen I booted into my new Mountain Lion installer and completely reformatted my Macintosh HD back into the 1 partition format.\nThen I installed Mountain Lion onto that using my Time Machine backup.\nAnd here I am back with the 1 partition and now using the entire drive! Lengthy process but got there in the end!\nSo if anyone else has got this problem, this is how to fix it! :)\nThanks for all of your help anyway!\n\nA: The primary partition can only be resized when all the other partitions - if existing - is deleted.\nTake a backup of the existing non-primary partition is highly suggested as all the data on those existing partitions will be lost.\nsummarily - \n1. Take a back up of all the existing non-primary ( and primary too) partitions.\n2. delete all the non-primary partition using Disk Utility tool.\n3. resize the primary partition using Disk Utility tool.\n\nA: You can't resize an existing partition in Disk Utility. Your only options are\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a separate partition to make use of the unused space. \n\n*Copy all your data to a backup drive, then erase and repartition the disk, then move your data back (when reformatting, be sure to select the drive, not just the existing named partition, or you will end up with the same unused disk space).\n\n\nA: you will use the disklist equitment to resize the macintosh disk,never give up!!\n", "Q: Watch youtube moview on a Mac using QuickTime Is it possible to watch youtube videos on a Mac using QuickTime as it is on iOS? \nHow to force Safari to render youtube video stream in QT plugin.\n\nA: There’re a couple of Safari extensions that will do this. ClickToPlugin and ClickToFlash.\nhttp://hoyois.github.com/safariextensions/clicktoplugin/\nBoth versions will swap out the Youtube Player for a standard HTML5 player. The extension also allows you to download the Youtube video.\n\nA: I don't think you can since youtube videos are flash based (or in some cases HTML5 player based).\nI did find a link that might help you a little:\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/2015789?start=0&tstart=0\n\nA: I use Videobox\nI often have to use Videobox's mini browser.

I have an iPad v1 and need to plug in its IP to a program on my computer to test files.\nThe problem is every time I connect, the IP is reset and I have to enter a new IP.\nIs there a way to have it permanently on one IP?\n\nA: Settings --> WiFi --> select the network --> select Static and set the necessary values\n\nA: In your router you should be able to statically assign an IP address for the iPad based on its MAC address.\n", "Q: What are the consequences of using DDR3 RAM in DDR2 MBP4.2? I'm supposed to use DDR2 5300 (667MHz) RAM for my MacBookPro 4,2. The max is 6GB, and I already have 4GB (2 x 2GB), so I only need a single stick of 4GB.  So far it looks like this spec RAM runs about $100.\n4GB of DDR3 RAM runs about $20.\nWhat are the consequences if I put the wrong RAM in? Will it work at all? Will it damage the RAM or the computer?\n\nA: DDR3 has a different pin and spacer configuration than DDR2. The two are not interchangeable. \nIf you manage to cram the DDR3 stick in, you'll really mess up your laptop. I strongly suggest you don't try it.\nThis image shows the difference : \n\nThanks, your diagram is worth 2^10 words.\n", "Q: Can homebrew and RVM agree on a $PATH?

I could be wrong but im pretty sure that the Apple Peel 520 2nd Generation doesn't support iOS 6.0.1 and if it doesn't which Apple Peel Device (or something similar) does? I looked up some stuff and so far what i found out is that the Apple Peel 520 2nd Generation supports iOS 5.1.1 but here's the catch. I bought my iPod Touch 4th Generation a few months ago at Walmart and it already had iOS 6.0 and a day or two later iOS 6.0.1 came out and i downloaded that. But that was BEFORE i found out about the Apple Peel 520 2nd Generation. So does that mean that i can't downgrade? And if i definately cannot downgrade, does anyone know of any other Apple Peel Device (or something similar) by Yosion or other similar companies that will?\n\nA: You cannot downgrade your device. It is forever locked to iOS 6.0.1.\nA downgrade for certain devices (those that run on the A4 processor, and yours does) is only possible should you have the SHSH blobs (using Redsnow). However, since you do not have them, there is no way to revert to any version prior to 6.0.1 (unless you saved the blobs for 6.0, then you could certainly revert to the prior version).\n", "Q: How do I get a notification sound on my iPhone 5?

I was told that iOS devices defaults to 802.11a which runs on 5 GHz band when 5 GHz 802.11n is not available. Have anyone experimented with that?\nHow does negotiation between access points and client devices work?\n\nA: The wireless chipset samples all spectrums and chooses the frequency that has the highest potential speed with a joinable SSID and won't generally switch to a different network unless there are errors or a drop. \nSince the protocols are different there isn't so much a negotiation as a decision tree which of the several channels to join. \n", "Q: Browsing in Finder is extremely slow while fine in Terminal I did Repair Disk Permissions, reindexing files for Spotlight, and remove cache folders but it's still broken.

If I start a new project I can create a webpage/website by simply using the GUI, drag and drop items, resize WITHOUT coding.  However, if I open an .html file with dashcode after I create a site the code opens.  I cannot figure out how to edit the page as I can when I first create a page.  I'd like to use the IDE that allows me to drag and drop things with ease, not manipulate the HTML.\n\nA: When you're trying to open your project, make sure you're opening the .dcproj file since this is the actual Dashcode project, rather than the exported HTML project.\nOpening the .html file created by Run & Share won't work in Dashcode's actual project editor, and will show the HTML code just as you mentioned. You have to open the Dashcode project file, saved as .dcproj by File → Save.\n\nA: I don't know about Dashcode, but if you want to use an IDE for easy editing of HTML then go for Dreamweaver/Coda/Espresso IDEs. They provide nice built-in APIs to ease programming. Taco HTML is a tool where you can easily debug and manipulate your HTML code, but there is no drag and drop there.\n", "Q: Trying to upgrade, OS X installer can't find hard drive The hard drive in my mom's MacBook (2,1) was dying so I got her an Adata SSD and replaced the original hard drive with it. I booted it up with her original Mac OS 10.4 install CD and used disk utility to format the SSD to have a single HSF+ partition and successfully installed Mac OS 10.4 on her laptop. \nNext I tired to upgrade the OS using my Mac OS 10.5 install CD, but the installer reports that it couldn't detect Mac OS 10.4 on the computer. This is not true, when started, the laptop can boot right into Tiger. \nWhen I turned on disk utility, in the OS 10.5 installer, no hard drive could be found. When I ran the command \"diskutil list\" in the terminal, in the OS 10.5 installer, no hard drive was found. However when I ran System Profiler, in the installer, I could find that under\nHardware > Serial-ATA \nthere was an \"ADATA SP900\" under \"Intel ICH7-M AHCI\" so the installer knows there is a drive there, even if it isn't detecting it. \nHow can I get the installer to recognize that I have Mac OS installed on my mom's laptop? \n\nA: I got it to work by booting my mom's computer in target disk mode and attaching my Mac with a firewire cable and rebooting my computer with the installer cd. \nThe installer, running on my computer, was able to recognize her disk and I was able to install the update. \nUnfortunately this solution required a second mac to work, and both macs need to have a firewire port (which are quickly disappearing from Apple's products). \n", "Q: Why does Ctrl+Alt+Backspace work to log in to Windows on MacBook Pro? I have Windows 7 installed in Boot Camp on my 2011 MacBook Pro.\nI have configured Windows to require a Ctrl+Alt+Del to log in.  This is supposed to prevent malware from putting up a fake login screen.\nThe MacBook Pro does not have a \"Del\" key.  Well, it does have a \"delete\" key, but that is equivalent to the \"Backspace\" key on a Windows keyboard.  The MacBook Pro does not have a key equivalent to the \"Del\" key on a Windows keyboard.  You have to press Fn+Delete on the MacBook Pro in order to simulate the Windows \"Del\" key.\nWhen I press Ctrl+Alt+Fn+Delete on the Windows login screen, it works as it should.  But I noticed that Ctrl+Alt+Delete works too, which really means that Ctrl+Alt+Backspace is working.  That should not work (I tried it on another Windows PC with a Windows keyboard, and it does not work), and it makes me wonder if it might be a possible security hazard.\n\nA: The key combination is a keyboard hook to call the trusted login process in windows but the apple driver in boot camp is sending that key combination that windows recognizes as the special key sequence and the actual keys used can be remapped. This is a apple article about the keyboard use in boot camp: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1167\nNote that in windows you can also remap those keys and use some other combination (assuming NT based windows).\n", "Q: can I point my Pictures folder to a folder in an external hard drive?

Or Aperture, it doesn't matter in this case.\nAlso, before we start, I would suggest you NOT to move your Pictures folder as it might mess with the structure of the system.\nAnyway, here are the steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Close iPhoto if open,\n\n*Go to your Pictures folder,\n\n*Move that folder named as iPhoto Library to your external disk,\n\n*Make sure that the transfer is FULLY finished,\n\n*Open iPhoto while holding down the alt key on your keyboard,\n\n*From the pop-up Finder browser, choose your iPhoto Library on your external disk.\n\n\nThis way you transferred your iPhoto library to your external disk and made iPhoto to directly open up with your photo libraries new place.\n", "Q: Time machine error backup failed with error 11 I have a western digital 2TB hard disk (wd caviar green) connected through a unitek sata hdd docking station with my macbook air (10.8.2).\nWhen I try to backup with time machine, the backup fails with an error.

To test this just type id and echo ~ to confirm that the Mac is fine, but the short name and home folder are not to your liking. Apple has an official procedure to fix this at http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1428 and we have several questions here that also cover the topic when people have found that HT1428 didn't work for them.\nThere are several procedures to edit the short name but they're all a pain. Furthermore, they often don't clean everything up correctly and traces of the old name you didn't like will remain on the system in folders and lists. Your best bet is to go into the users preference and create a new admin user with a password that you know. \nThen you can follow the steps on this other answer here to delete and re-create your account with all of your files intact and the correct short name  that you prefer. You will find that you prompt now matches the short name that you like. Before starting this process, you might make a good backup if your system just in case you make a mistake of my instructions are not clear or if the computer just crashes at the wrong time. \n", "Q: iOS 6 Auto Restart Ok here it is, when I updated my 3GS to iOS 6 there are times that my iPhone is freezing (when I used the \"Tap to Tweet\" button) and my iPhone just auto restarting for a couple of seconds. Is this auto restart thing is a new feature of iOS 6 or just a bug?\n\nA: It may be an odd bug or a hardware failure or a sign that the OS didn't install correctly on your device.\nYou could look at the logs on the device or go through some of the troubleshooting steps to see if you need service or just to try restoring the OS again.\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to the express lane: https://expresslane.apple.com/GetproductgroupList.action\n\n*Select iPhone\n\n*Select Service Requests & Troubleshooting\n\n*Select Restore or update not working as expected\nI would send in the diagnostics and work through the steps listed. Alternatively, if your phone works for several minutes, you could also browse the error logs from Settings > General > About > Diagnostics & Usage > Diagnostics & Usage Data\nLook for LatestCrash and panic entries first - and then perhaps other log files might be of use. These logs also can be synced to a computer for easier searching with iTunes, Xcode and other programs that read files from iOS devices.\n", "Q: How to extend bootcamp partition? When I was installing windows 7 on my mac I allocated 55GB to my bootcamp partition, I now realise that it is not enough for me. is there a way to extend it, without loosing any data and re-instaling windows?\nAdditionally, is it possible to store files on Macintosh HD partition (as it shows up when I access my computer from windows) while using windows?\nThat would solve the problem, however I'm not sure if it will work.\n\nA: Late note: iPartition cannot handle CoreStorage or APFS volumes & is no longer supported by its author. Coriolis is now a single page site, with unsupported free license downloads for some of its old software.\nIf you are still on a pre-CoreStorage macOS, then it is still very much the tool to use.\n\nFor all my partitioning, I use and recommend iPartition.\niPartition allows you to modify Boot Camp partitions just like regular partitions. iPartition will reconfigure the Windows partitions automatically.\n\nYou can use iPartition on drives that contain Boot Camp volumes; in fact, you can even resize your Windows partitions, and let iPartition take care of reconfiguring the Windows boot process for you.\n\n\n\n\nA: This should work:\n1) First, shrink an adjacent partition to make room using Disk Utility in MacOS:\n\n\n*\n\n*Launch Disk Utility in MacOS  \n\n*Identify the Windows partition and the adjacent ones \n\n*Using Disk Utility, shrink one (or both) adjacent partitions\n\n\n2) Then in Windows, expand the bootcamp partition.\n\nA: I second the recommendation for iPartition, I've been using Coriolis Software's iPartition & iDefrag for many years - seemingly bullet proof, and will allow you to shorten the Mac-HD partition & lengthen the Windows partition in one operation.\nAlternatively (or as well), for Windows to be able to see (have r/w access) to a HFS+ partition, you need a HFS+ file system driver installed in Windows.  I think there's free ones, but I have used & can recommend Paragon Software's pair of file-sys drivers, for Windows to access HFS+ partitions, and for Mac to have r/w access to NTFS partitions (by itself Mac can only read NTFS, not write).\n\nA: There is no direct support for resizing the Boot Camp Windows volume from inside either macOS or Windows. You need 3rd party software to do this safely.\nThe current Apps that can do this are Paragon Hard Disk Manager, Paragon\nCampTune or Twocanoes' WinClone\nNever attempt to resize any other way - you will break something.\n", "Q: How to find a backup of my iPhone contacts? My phone accidentally was dropped in water. I tried to sync it on my Mac with iTunes to save my contacts. Next day I connected it to my Mac again and all the contacts were gone.\nI have tried libraries/mobile sync. I located the backup folders but it only has 4 contacts. I need my old contacts and I have tried iphonebackupextractor. But it also shows only 4 contacts.\nWere can I locate my earlier contacts of the first sync? Or has it been overwritten the earlier contacts?\n\nA: On your Mac, the backups are stored in ~/Library/Application Support/MobileSync/Backup/\nThis is covered in HT4946: iTunes: About iOS backups\nIf iTunes doesn't show an earlier dated backup (sometimes it saves off a backup when you upgrade from one major iOS level to another), you would need to erase and restore the Backup folder from a Mac backup (perhaps Time Machine is turned on) to get that older backup of your phone.\nAlso, check to see if iCloud has backups of your device. It stores several days worth of backups, so don't delay to check there in case ongoing backups of the now empty phone would erase those older backups with the data you seek.\n\nA: I'm with the iPhone Backup Extractor team, I must point out that the free version of the software will only extract four records of each category (contacts, sms, photos, etc.) when used in Simple Mode. The limitation in extraction might be why you only found four contacts in your backup when using it. \nThe application will show you exactly how many contacts were detected in the iTunes backup under \"Available data\", in the \"Contacts\" section (it's the number shown in blue).\nAlso, you can see how many backups you have and change from the dropdown menu which backup you wish to extract from. If there really are just four contacts in that backup, do try to see if there are any other previous backups which contain the data you are looking for.\nEven when backups are corrupt or damaged in some way, if the data exists and has not been overwritten, it is possible to recover it. I would suggest contacting the iPhone Backup Extractor customer support team (support@reincubate.com) if all else fails - we have four years experience working with iTunes backups and we have helped many users recover their data, perhaps we can do the same for you.\n", "Q: How do I create a read-only access for wiki server?

I just got an iPhone 5 with iOS 6 and am struggling with all the different sound/vibration settings.  It seems like there are so many different ways to control this (up/down buttons on the left of the phone, the on/off toggle on the left, Settings --> Sound, and individual in-app settings).\nIdeally what I want is for the phone to be silent (vibrate only) all of the time, except when:\n\n\n*\n\n*I do something explicit to turn the volume on (e.g. I am playing a game or listening to music or something)\n\n*It is plugged in\n\n*An alarm goes off\n\n\nWhat I specifically do NOT want:\n\n\n*\n\n*The ringer to ever ring while the phone is in my pocket (i.e. 100% of the time it is not plugged in)\n\n*The alarm to ever NOT make a audible sound, regardless of any other volume/sound settings (e.g. if the answer is \"flip the toggle switch on before you go to sleep and flip it off when you wake up,\" that's not good enough because I know I'll forget to do that and miss my alarm)\n\n\nIs what I want possible?  What settings should I use?  Does this depend on the choice of alarm clock app?\n\nA: Sound on iPhone is reasonably complicated when you get down and start \"taking it apart\". This is because it is managed on a very much case-by-base basis.\nFor example, if you call up Siri, and adjust the volume, it will only be adjusting the volume for Siri, not something like the ringer volume. \nSo to divide things up and try to answer your question, I'll start with the basics. \nIf you turn on Vibration mode (orange position) using the switch on the side of the phone it will turn off almost all sounds. Unlock, keyboards and such sounds will no longer be on. Notifications and phone calls will vibrate but not be heard. You will have to turn the switch off (no orange) in order to hear normal sounds while in apps - (i.e. games). When alternating vibration mode versus normal mode, iPhone remembers your previous state, and will set the volume to what it was before vibration mode was active.\nException: alarms set in the Clock.app are still heard. In fact, there is no way to turn off Clock.app's alarms from being heard unless you turn off the alarm(s) itself. As for other alarm clock style apps (for example, Sleep Cycle), it is up to the developer to make it behave like Clock.app. That is the case with Sleep Cycle, but it would be worth verifying with any other alarm style app.\nIf you turn down the volume in the Music.app (or double tap home button and swipe to the right twice), or while watching a video, or in Settings.app, that is the volume that is applied across the board, mostly. That volume reflects the volume for videos, music, and apps that in general make noise - as in, games. Note that iPhone remembers your settings when you have headphones plugged in vs. not.\nWhen iPhone is unlocked and you are on the home screen and you adjust the volume, you are adjusting ringer volume. In other words if the vibration switch is off (no orange) then that would be the volume it would ring at.\nDo-not-disturb suppresses basically all notifications (there are some configuration options there). Again, alarms (from Clock.app, and other properly set up apps like SleepCycle) will stay play.\nThe only thing you can't do is have it toggle sound settings when it is plugged into the wall vs. when it is not. I think you will find it becomes habit, however, to throw the vibration switch.\n\nA: A jailbroken iPhone can manipulate a lot of these settings you desire as they are not options included in the stock iOS. Remember though, while jailbreaking may be beneficial, it has its flaws also.\n*edit\nVibrate Things is an application tweak that allows you to customize a bunch of things to vibrate. It can be found in cydia after jailbreaking.\nIf you like to know you are in vibrate you can install muteicon which shows a mute symbol in the status bar. \nThe app Auto Silent will disable the ringer switch but I believe it isn't updated yet for iOS6. This becomes in handy when you accidentally flip the switch and not realize it...\nThere are many more application that do similar things ^^ googled those in seconds to edit this post to answer the comment.\n", "Q: How do I give a user sudo permissions? On my computer I have two accounts: geoff and admin. I want to do gacutil.... Doing it in account geoff (where I need it to be done) I get the message: \ngac directories could not be created, possibly permission issues.\n\nWhen I login as admin this seems to work fine. \nSo I go back to the geoff account and try sudo gacutil... and putting the password for geoff but it tells me that geoff is not in the sudoers file.\nSo it seems that I either have to get geoff in as a sudoer (how?) or else get my admin account to do the gacutil on geoff's behalf (is this possible?).\n\nA: Rather than give geoff sudo privileges, consider adding the account to the admin group so that it inherits the admin group sudoer privileges. This would be the more correct way to do things.\nTo add geoff to the admin group you'll need to run the following as the admin account:\nsudo dseditgroup -o edit -a geoff -t user admin\n\nYou may also want to consider putting geoff in the wheel group too:\nsudo dseditgroup -o edit -a geoff -t user wheel\n\nThe wheel group is a BSD-ism, where OS X has its roots. In traditional BSD systems the wheel group was used to keep a collection of users who were allowed to become superusers using the su command. It's not strictly necessary to be in both admin and wheel but anyone setup as as \"Administrator\" on the machine through the UI for adding a user is in both so it can't hurt to replicate that setup.\n\nA: To add a user to sudoers, as admin do sudo visudo\nThen scroll down to  \n# User privilege specification\nroot    ALL=(ALL) ALL\n%admin  ALL=(ALL) ALL\n\nplace the cursor at the next (empty) line, and press a (for append). Then type  \nshortname   ALL=(ALL) ALL\n\nwhere shortname is the short name for the user that you are adding to sudoers (there should be TAB between the short name and ALL). After that press ESC (to exit append mode). Then type :wq and then Enter to quit visudo, saving the changes.\n", "Q: Why is double time speed different on iPod vs iPhone? I have a 6th gen iPod Nano (software version 1.2) and an iPhone 4S (iOS 6.0.1) . On the iPod, I have options to listen to podcasts at ½x, 1x, and 2x time. On the iPhone Podcasts app version 1.1.2 (209), I have options for ½x, 1x, 1.5x, 2x, and 3x time. If I listen to a podcast at 1x speed on both devices, it unsurprisingly sounds the same. However, if I listen to a podcast at 2x speed on both devices, it sounds more sped up on the iPhone. The voices sound more natural on the iPod but more like chipmunks on the iPhone. Is there a reason for this difference? Why do these two Apple devices handle audio speeds differently?\n\nA: I can only offer a shot in the dark, and that is that the iPod has a weaker processor and when it tries to double the speed, the time it takes for the processor to do some calculations slows it down a little.\n", "Q: Finding drivers for Macbook Pro (13 inch, i5, 2.3GHZ) without bootcamp I had a customer come in (regular) and brought me a mac his son screwed up by deleting partitions and installing windows.

Keep in mind that caffeinate only works when running on AC power.\n\nA: Not sure when it was first available, but on MacOS High Sierra 10.13.4 you can go to Apple (top left) > Lock Screen or press control-command-q to activate the lock screen.\nYou should also do the first step in @daGUY's answer\n\nIn System Preferences > Energy Saver, check the box for \"Prevent computer from sleeping automatically when the display is off\" (on laptops, this is under the Power Adapter tab)\n\n\nA: *\n\n*In System Preferences > Energy Saver, check the box for \"Prevent computer from sleeping automatically when the display is off\" (on laptops, this is under the Power Adapter tab)\n\n*In System Preferences > Security & Privacy, check the box for \"Require password after sleep or screen saver begins\" and set the delay in the dropdown menu to \"immediately\"\n\nNow, you can hit command+option+Q  to turn off the display without sleeping the computer, and doing anything that turns on the display (like hitting a key or clicking a mouse button) will prompt you for your account password.\nOn older Macs, the shortcut is different: command+option+Power or control+shift+power.\n\nA: You can try \"Lock Me Now\" app from the app store. It gives a pretty neat way to lock the mac. \n", "Q: Macbook Pro unresponsive while opening applications I have had an 240gb Corsair SSD in my 2.53 GHz Intel Core i5 Macbook Pro (OSX 10.6.8) for about 8 months. The computer has 8gb RAM. It has been great for most of that time, but in the last month or so, I have experienced the following problem:\nWhenever I open an application, the computer becomes unresponsive for about 5 seconds. I can move the mouse but clicking has no effect, and the keyboard does not work. The screen continues to behave normally (it shows the application opening screen, background applications and iTunes will continue working, etc), I just can't click or type anything.\nWhat can I do to get to the bottom of this? Nothing immediately jumps out when I look at Activity Monitor.\nThere are 50gb of free space on the SSD, and RAM is maxed out at 8GB. The computer is otherwise fine, though seems to freeze a lot when using Chrome (I hear this is not uncommon).\nUpdate: I had the same problem on a clone of my hard drive running on a standard HD (non-SSD), so the SSD is irrelevant.\n\nA: The issue turned out to be with a background program, Typinator 5.3. The problem only occurred while Typinator was active. Upgrading to Typinator 5.4 seems to have fixed the problem.\n", "Q: Contacts sync via CardDav misses some I recently set up a CardDav account on my iPhone 4S which is running iOS 6.01. It synced with my GMail account just fine, however, the Contacts app only shows those that are within the My Contacts group. I have a handful of other groups that I've created to organize my contacts, so not all of them are shown under My Contacts (what they call a contact group seems to be just a label).\nMy question is, how can I view/use all my GMail contacts on my iPhone, regardless of the GMail group they are in? Or is that something Google doesn't support yet?\n\nA: As far as I know this is a default behaviour of Google Mail.\nOn Android there is a fairly hidden way to select more groups but not on iOS or other normal cardDAV clients.\nYou may find fruux an alternative that works fine for me in this case.\nIf there is a single addressbook at fruux with a default name like “contacts”, iOS will attempt to interpret vcf-Groups as contact groups. E. g. eM Client will create contact groups for each new assigned category simultanously.\n", "Q: How can I charge and output audio from iPhone 5 in a car? I want to charge my iPhone 5 and listen to the music using AUX in my car. How can I do this using one cable? I have such a cable for my iPhone 4. Is there any good option for iPhone 5?\n\nA: My 2013 Ford Ranger (the T6 international version) has an audio system with a USB port on it, and it plays audio through that regardless of whether it is the old 30-pin connector or a Lightning connector on the other end. When I plug in my iPhone, it says \"Connecting iPod\" on the audio screen. It also supports audio over Bluetooth.\n(When saying \"in a car\", please be a little more specific about the car and/or its audio system. They are all different)\n\nA: You can purchase a roughly $30 adapter from Apple to use your old cable with your new iPhone 5. This is a 30 pin to Lightning adapter.\n\nA: I simply use an aux cable which is small enough to fit next to the 30pin cable to  charge the ipod or lightning to charge my iphone 5s. But that still is not 1 cable. I had to search hard for an aux cable which was small enough. Most aux cables are to thick to fit next to my 30pin adapter. Lightning is much thinner so that would fit easily.\n\nA: There's more expensive $30 option on amazon\nAnd ten time cheaper slew of cables offered on aliexpress for $3\n", "Q: where is Ruby looking for SSL_CERT_FILE?

(Or am I doin' it wrong?) On my OS X 10.5.8 system, the man page for 'file' says:\n\n-h, --no-dereference\n    option causes symlinks not to be followed (on systems  that  support  symbolic\n    links). This is the default if the environment variable POSIXLY_CORRECT is not\n    defined.\n\n\nand also:\n\n-L, --dereference\n    option  causes  symlinks to be followed, as the like-named option in ls(1)\n    (on systems that support symbolic links).  This is the default if the \n    environment variable POSIXLY_CORRECT is defined.\n\n\nFor me, the default seems to be the \"-L\" behavior (i.e., always traversing symlinks and reporting the type of the target file), regardless of whether I have POSIXLY_CORRECT set or not. \nThe \"-h\" option does the right thing if I explicitly specify it, fortunately.\nCan anyone still running 10.5.8 (yeah, I know...) verify whether this is the behavior for them as well? And if it does work for you as advertised by the man page, any theories on what I'm doing wrong? I've checked my spelling, just to get that out of the way...\n\nA: On my copy of Mac OS X 10.5.8, I see the same behaviour as you. file somelink and file -L somelink have the same, --dereference behaviour, regardless of the presence or absence of an environment variable POSIXLY_CORRECT. file -h somelink has the --no-dereference behaviour.\n", "Q: How to set Video Background in iMovie How can I set a video background in iMovie?

You can make a white jpeg photo with Photoshop or Inkscape or whatever program you have, insert it as a frame, and then it's white. Then you can drag title text onto that white image.\nYou can also drag title text as a new clip, and then it gives you an option of various backgrounds (including white).\nFor the rest of the video, well, you see video as the background, not any color.\nIf you want more control of layers and opacity and backgrounds and such, you may want to consider a step up to Final Cut Pro.\n", "Q: Tracing the source of \"There was a problem connecting to the server\" alerts After upgrading from MacOS 10.6 to 10.8, I keep getting alerts on my MBP saying \"There was a problem connecting to the server xyz\".  The thing is, there is no longer a machine called \"xyz\" on my network (I've renamed it to something else in hopes of eliminating/diagnosing this problem).\nAfter googling around a bit, I suspect that the culprit is an association of a file type with an application that is on the xyz machine (that I have previously run on my MBP after mounting xyz:/Applications). When these alerts pop out, I see (via top) that a time-machine-induced mdworker is active (seemingly confirming that it's trying to use the remote application to extract information from a local file).\nIs there some way that I can confirm what process is actually generating the alerts? Is there a better way of diagnosing their source?\nUpdate: I was never able to figure out what was actually generating the alert, but I was able to abate it by doing a complete re-install of 10.8 (via the recovery boot option). To my surprise -- in addition to eliminating the alerts -- this didn't even require any recovery of my apps/files from backup (not that you should try this without having everything backed up!)\n\nA: I am getting this as well.

Being the local geek, friends and family turn to me for upgrading RAM in their computers. They provide the new sticks and I keep the old ones.

Unfortunately I haven't found a motherboard with 16 SO-DIMM slots. I'm hoping for a productive use for these sticks. Something to benefit my 2008 Mac Pro or another device on my network.\nPreferably the uses would be something other than vaporware products and something I might actually purchase, PCIe based or as a stand-alone thing.\n\nA: You could sell them on eBay.

Where do I look?\nAlthough some people may use this answer as forensics, I'm looking more in the sense that I installed a few python libraries and am not sure what I did with them, and want to do some housekeeping.\nTerminal commands (grep, ls, etc are all welcome).  Lacking an all encompassing solution, I'd appreciate your input on whatever you can contribute.\n\nA: Mount both volumes on a Mac and drag both drives into a file comparison tool like Kaleidoscope. It will show file differences as well as hilight files that exist on one folder as opposed to the other folder.\nYou could also diff a file listing like ls -laR or whatever other flags you prefer to see what differences (excepting file metadata and ACL / special flags that either take other ls flags or are invisible to a simple file listing.) Some people go so far as to create a listing with md5 or other hashes that checksum the actual contents of files, but that's more appropriate for a security scan / configuration management suite like munki or tripwire.\nLots of blogs cover that sort of professional system management like these entries from 318, Inc.\n", "Q: How do I find out what computers I have authorized? I just authorized iTunes against a laptop and I was expecting it to be my third of five computers authorized on my iTunes account. But iTunes said it was the fourth.\nHow do I find out what machines are authorized against my account?\n\nA: The question asks about computer Authorization. But some of the answers here confuse Authorization with Association. I'd like to clarify the terms first, using Apple's own definitions, then answer the question.\nAuthorization\n\nAuthorization refers to computers only. Authorizing a computer allows you to play media purchased from the iTunes Store with a specific Apple ID. In order to use apps, audiobooks, books, DRM-protected music, and movies on a computer it must be Authorized. Each Apple ID can authorize a maximum of 5 computers.\nYou can deauthorize each computer individually. If you've forgotten which computers you have authorized in the past, there is not a way to list all authorized computers. Apple only tells you the number that are authorized. However, once a year you can Deauthorize All computers from within your iTunes Store account settings.\nMore information about Authorization can be found in this Apple Tech Note.\n\nAssociation\n\nAssociation allows you to download past iTunes purchases onto a different device. Apple calls this iTunes in the Cloud. In addition, association allows the use of Apple features such as iTunes Match and Automatic Downloads.\nYou can associate up to 10 devices with each Apple ID. By device Apple means an iOS gadget or an authorized computer. (Since every associated computer must also be authorized that limits you to 5 associated computers for these features.) So you can associate one computer and 9 other devices, or 5 computers and 5 other devices, but not 9 computers and 1 other device. You're limited to 5 computers.\nThere is a list of associated devices which can be found in the Account section if iTunes Store.\nFor more information on Association see this Apple Tech Note\n\nSo the only way to determine which computers are authorized is by trial and error: Deauthorize each computer you own in turn using Store > Deauthorize This Computer… within iTunes.\nIf after doing this the iTunes Store still says you have authorized computers, you only have one option: Use the Deauthorize All feature of iTunes Store, and then reauthorize the computers you own. But keep in mind, Apple only allows you to Deauthorize All once every twelve months.\nSpecial note about about Association and Android phones.\nUsing Apple's own definition from the Support site.\nYou can't view a list of your associated devices or remove any of your associated devices using an Android phone, but Android phones do count against your ten-device limit.\nMore information about Authorization and Association can be found on the View and remove your associated devices in iTunes page.\n\nA: It looks like there is no way to see which specific computers are authorized; you can only see how many are authorized.\nPer this Apple discussion thread, you will have to deauthorize all of them and reauthorize only the ones you want to be able to play.\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/3065517?start=0&tstart=0\nI'm not sure if devices count toward this limit.\n\nA: the easiest way to do is\nfirst deauthorize all accounts ,\nthen authorize all computer as you wish :)\naccording to https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204385#all\n    Deauthorize all computers\n================================\n\n    If you need to deauthorize your computer but you can't access it, \nyou need to deauthorize all computers. This option is available after you authorize 2 computers using your Apple ID. \nYou can deauthorize all computers once per year.    \n    You should deauthorize all computers if:    \n    Your computer doesn't work anymore.\n    You sold or gave away a computer and didn't deauthorize it first.\n    To deauthorize all computers:    \n    To automatically open iTunes and sign in to your Account Information page from your computer, \nclick this link: View My Account. Or follow these steps:    \n    Open iTunes.\n    If you’re not signed in, sign in with your Apple ID.\n    From the menu bar at the top of your computer screen or \nat the top of the iTunes window, choose Account > View My Account.\n    Enter your password, then press the Return or Enter key on your keyboard, \nor click View Account.\n    On the Account Information page:\n    Scroll to the Apple ID Summary section. To the right of Computer Authorizations, click Deauthorize All.\n    The Deauthorize All button appears only if you have more than 2 authorized computers. \nIf you don't see the Deauthorize All button, that means that you only have one authorized computer.    \n    When you deauthorize all, you don't lose content\n    When you deauthorize a single computer, you don't lose content. The same applies to if you choose to deauthorize all computers. \nYou just won't be able to access the content that you bought from iTunes on those computers \nuntil you reauthorize them. You need to have the computer to reauthorize it.\n\n\n\n    After you deauthorize\n==================================\n\n    Reauthorize each computer that you want to use with iTunes:    \n    Open iTunes.\n    From the menu bar at the top of your computer screen or \nat the top of the iTunes window, \nchoose Account > Authorizations > Authorize This Computer.\n    Enter your Apple ID and password.\n    Click Authorize.\n\n\nA: To see what computers are authorized you have to go to directly to the apple website (appleid.apple.com) and sign into your account. This is different from going to your account via the iTunes app itself.\nOn your account on the apple website, you will see all computers including Apple TV. When I did this, there were 2 authorized computers (that I had previously used) that showed up online but did not show up when I went through my iTunes app account.\n\n\n\nA: Here is how to do it on macOS Catalina.\nOpen Music application, go to menu Account -> View my account, under the iTunes in the cloud section click Manage devices, from here you can remove old devices that you authorised earlier.\n\nA: Go to iTunes on a computer and select your Account (on the right hand side of the window towards the top once you are signed in).

I end up with quite a number of duplicate pictures on my iPhone because of Photostream. For example, I take a picture which is saved in the Camera Roll. It is then automatically uploaded to my Photostream. Then, I share the photo to three different Photostreams. As a result I can see the same picture in 5 different places. I'm really tight on space on my device and wondering if this would make it more pronounced?\nIs iPhone smart enough to manage duplicates? If not, is there an alternate way to manage duplicate photos at least somewhat?\n\nA: If you go to Settings > General > Usage, it will show under Storage how much memory is used by Photos & Camera, and when you tap that, it will show you what portion is from your Photo Stream. Now, I had a shared photo stream with about 20 photos, and I actually deleted it, and when I checked I saw that Photo Stream storage did not go down. So I suspect if the same photo is in multiple photo streams, it does not use extra storage on your device. What it did imply, however, is that each photo in my Photo Stream is using about 1MB, and I know full sized photos from the iPhone are usually closer to 3MB. Apple says that photos downloaded to the Photo Stream on mobile devices are scaled down to use less space.\nSo this all indicates that the Photo Stream includes a duplicate copy of each photo, but a single photo in multiple photo streams does not increase storage.\nWhat I personally recommend is importing photos and videos to iPhoto or Picasa and using that software to delete them from the iPhone every once in a while. This clears the camera roll only. That keeps storage down while still letting you view recent photos in your Photo Stream.\n", "Q: How can I watch slowed down Youtube videos in iPad? I found this tutorial here but I am unable to find such type of buttons in iPad. I am also unable to slow down videos in OS X. I am trying to watch this video here but it is too fast educational video. So how can I watch slowed-down videos?\n\nA: That tutorial on slowing down YouTube videos was made in iOS 5 with the older YouTube app. You probably have iOS 6 and are using the YouTube website or the YouTube app released by Google more recently.\nBoth the web app and the YouTube app no longer play videos with the QuickTime player with those controls. The only thing that still uses that interface is the YouTube app on the iPhone. I suppose you can try experimenting with other third-party YouTube video viewers, one of those may use QuickTime for playback, but I don't have experience with them.\nBy the way, I don't know how useful that video will be even slowed down, and there are a lot of great Blender tutorials out there if you look.\nEDIT: Actually, embedded YouTube videos will use that player, so you just have to embed the video on a web page and then browse to that page on the iPad.\n\nA: I made an action extension for iOS Safari that does just that. For those unaware, action extension basically adds button to Safari action sheet that allows you to adjust video playback speed. Works on both iPhone and iPad. It works with YouTube and virtually any other HTML5 video player, in Safari itself, rather then having to open different app. https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1205188880\n\nA: you can check this post to slow motion the YouTube videos\nhttp://www.aiseesoft.com/how-to/slow-down-youtube-videos.html\n\nA: Download an app called SpeedTube. \n", "Q: There is an issue with the time in my macbook air My laptop displays the time correctly in the menu bar, but when it records an activity, like the creation of a file, a sent message in iMessage, a reminder, it always shows the time as 7pm with whatever minutes are accurate. So if I send an iMessage at 3:22pm it would appear as sent at 7:22pm. And if I make a folder at 10:00am it appears as created at 7:00pm.This is driving me crazy. How can I solve this?\n\nA: Have you tried resetting the PRAM? \n\nShut down your Mac. Locate the following keys on the keyboard: Command\n  (⌘), Option, P, and R.

When I try to download songs, it gives me this message:\n\nAre you sure you want to remove existing music and audiobooks from this iPod and sync with this iTunes library?\n[Remove and Sync] [Cancel]\n\nI just updated iTunes to version 11.0.1.  On the previous version, iTunes didn't try to delete the files I already had on my iPod.\n\nA: You have two options.\nOne is to simply connect the iPod, choose not to sync, select the songs you want to transfer, and drag them to your iPod. That should copy them without syncing the whole library. You can also go into the iPod from within iTunes, and you can choose options in the various categories (like music, photos, movies) and choose not to sync them to be sure they won't be touched.\nYour other option is to transfer everything from your iPod to iTunes and then sync. See this Apple support document for information on how to do that. Once everything has been transferred and is in your iTunes library (and be SURE that anything you want to be on your iPod is also in the iTunes library), then you can safely sync and ignore the warning about everything being deleted from your iPod (since it will be re-added during the sync).\n\nA: In iTunes choose the \"manually manage music and videos\" option for the iPod. This should allow you to add/remove/edit music and playlists on that device from any machine.\n", "Q: If mac has the built-in backup tool time machine, why we still need mac data recovery? I dont know much about computer thing and just knew that mac has a built-in backup called time-machine? what is that? can it help us recover the lost data in my mac. and why people still need some third party mac data recovery tool like minitool mac data recovery software used by my friends for a couple of years?\n\nA: Time Machine is a bit different from third party data recovery software. Here's how they work:\nWhen your computer is connected to an external hard drive and Time Machine is turned on, every hour it backs up the files on your computer (or any files changed since the previous backup). In this way, you always have a copy of everything, including versions going back in the past (depending on how large the external hard drive is). Then if you lose a file, you can grab a copy from this backup. (As a side note, the latest version of OS X includes a Versions feature that makes locally stored backups of older versions of files, so if you change a document, you can still see what it used to be.)\nThird party data recovery software, on the other hand, is what you use when you do not have an actual backup to rely on. It's also not very reliable. What this does is it tries to scan your Mac's hard drive's empty space for files that were deleted. This sometimes works because even though files are deleted from the hard drive, the hard drive isn't necessarily overwritten, so some deleted files may still be retrievable.\n\nA: Time Machine is a tool by Apple that stores incremental backups to an external hard drive. Third party applications may add other functionality your friends may not want. From personal experience, Time Machine has saved me several times & I recommend it. For more info on Time Machine, see this article: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1427\n\nA: From time to time your hard disk might write garbage that results in corrupt files. Time Machine will have no clue that those files are corrupt and will back them up. Hopefully Time Machine will have backed up a good copy at some point in the past.\nHFS+ is an old filesystem and doesn’t do much to prevent filesystem corruption. That’s when a data recovery tool might come in handy.\n", "Q: How to fix screwed font display in password entry dialog? I don't have a single clue how my Mac OS comes to be like this.. \nWhenever I'm prompted to enter my password for admin rights to make changes to the system, my Mac OS seems to have a hard time finding the correct characters to represent the Roman alphabets it wants to display. Here are some screenshots regarding what it shows:\n\n\nI suppose there is some bug (it is a Mac OS X version 10.7.5) or maybe I've accidentally deleted some system files required for the encoding..\nThis isn't really a big problem (since everything else works well), but as time goes by I feel the need to fix it.\nI would appreciate if someone can provide me a solution.\n\nA: So apparently it was solved by removing the fontd databases and deleting the files of conflicting fonts. (I guess the conflicting fonts were shown in Font Book?)\nsudo atsutil databases -remove; atsutil server -shutdown\n\nThe password dialogs and force quit window are shown by processes owned by the root, so -removeUser might not work. launchd starts a new fontd process automatically, so atsutil server -ping is not needed.\n\nA: using about your own name and scramble with it\n", "Q: iWork Numbers increase column size for sum If I have columns that sum at the bottom, how can I have the sum function automatically include a newly inserted row.\n    a\n  +---+\n1 | 1 |\n2 | 1 |\n3 | 1 |\n4 | 1 |\n  +---+\n  |=sum(a1:a4)|\n\nThen when I add row 5 the sum function should be\n=sum(a1:a5)\n\n\nA: This functionality is embedded and its default behaviour.

I’ve upgraded to the latest iOS (6.0.1) before that. Will erasing all data and settings affect my previous upgrade?\n\nA: No. The OS updates exist apart from any user data that would (or would not) get cleared by an erase all content and settings operation.\nA restore will also restore the same OS as was on the device unless iTunes both sees a newer version of the iOS and you have told it to upgrade to that newer OS. Anything you do on the device in terms of resetting and erasing will not revert an iOS update or upgrade.\n", "Q: Cannot wake Mountain Lion from safe sleep I have a late-2010 MacBook Air on which I am running OS X Mountain Lion v10.8.2 with FileVault 2 enabled.\nWhen I try to wake it from safe sleep:\n\n\n*\n\n*the panel is backlit but nothing is displayed;\n\n*the light on the ⇪ Caps Lock key is responsive; and\n\n*left alone, the machine eventually powers down (but it resumes in the same state when power is restored).\nThe only way that I have been able to use the machine again is to hard-reset it (which I never like doing); but upon rebooting, shortly after authenticating there is a kernel panic.  The machine then starts normally after the consequent soft-reboot.\nGrateful for thoughts on how to identify the cause and/or resolve the problem.\n\nUpdate 1\nHaving continuted to search around, I discovered a post in which a similar problem was resolved by:\n\n\n*\n\n*disabling safe sleep;\n\n*rebooting;\n\n*removing the hibernatefile;\n\n*rebooting;\n\n*re-enabling safe sleep.\n\n\nI performed these steps, apparently to no avail.  However, it now appears that if I enter my password whilst the screen is backlit and nothing is displayed, my wallpaper is (slowly) revealed together with the normal wake-from-sleep login box.  I can't be certain whether this was also true prior to performing the above steps, as I'm not sure that I ever tried entering my password at the blank screen.\nSadly, that's as good as it gets: neither a mouse pointer nor keyboard cursor are visible on the screen; and the keyboard is unresponsive.  The clock, battery status and WiFi icons in the top-right of the screen all remain in their pre-sleep states and do not update; if the computer is left for long enough, there is eventually a kernel panic (apparently related to the graphics drivers?).\n\nUpdate 2\nFollowing @danielAzuelos's suggestion, I ran Apple Hardware Test (from the Software Reinstall Drive) in extended mode, but no faults were identified.\nNeither USB port is in use.\nI discovered that the problem does not manifest when DestroyFVKeyOnStandby=0, so there is almost certainly something wrong with how my hibernating MacBook configures EFI to wake.\nI have discovered that, if the machine goes into safe sleep when attached to an external display, everything works exactly as it should (even if the external display is no longer attached on wake).\n\nA: I'm delighted to report that, after installing the OS X Mountain Lion v10.8.3 Update, this problem has gone away:\n\nAbout the update\nThis update is recommended for all OS X Mountain Lion users and includes features and fixes that improve the stability, compatibility, and security of your Mac, including:\n[ deletia ]\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*A fix for an issue that may cause the screen to display incorrectly after waking from sleep\n  \n\n\nA: FileVault 2 still has many issues. Your best bet is to file a bug report with Apple at https://bugreport.apple.com/ so that they can investigate. \nTurn on SSH and use another machine to run sudo sysdiagnose (or sudo spindump if that doesn't finish) while your computer is in this state. Send them the output file.\nBackground: I filed a bug report with Apple about a similar issue (same behavior, but waking up from sleep with a monitor and the power plugged in) and that is what they said to do.

It's a nightmare to have to keep clicking between them, especially in the new iTunes. At the moment I'm taking a screenshot every time I delete an app, which is far from ideal.\nI'm wondering if there is a way to have one window open with a list of apps, and one window open with a list of my syncs within iTunes?\n\nA: Certainly, deleting your iTunes library on your computer, then just syncing your iPad back to your computer would be the most ideal solution. There is no way to access old versions of iTunes when things weren't synced as they are now so the way you described isn't possible. However, as long as you have all of your stuff from your computer, then deleting everything there and just keeping the stuff from your iPad is probably the best solution. Sorry if it's not what you wanted to hear.\n\nA: It isn't exactly what you are looking for, but it's close...\nGo to Apps (not under iPad, but the main Apps section in iTunes) and click List. Then sort the list by date modified, and add the column for Kind. This will show you the most recently modified apps (and you can sort by iPad only for the few that you might have).\nIt doesn't show you a list of which apps are installed, but it might save you some screenshots. :)\nTo clarify: the \"Modified Date\" is simply the date that the app was last updated from the App Store. If you keep your apps up to date, this might give you some help.\n", "Q: Copy video files as is from iPhone 5 to Mac Is there a simple way of copying video files (taken with the camera, so they are .mov) from iPhone 5 right to desktop using the USB cable? I thought of adding them to Goodreader, but Goodreader compresses the files before adding them. Dropbox would maybe kind of work but I guess it uploads to the internet dropbox first which is an unnecessary and slow roundtrip, especially since WIFI on iPhone 5 is (still) broken.\n\nA: Image Capture works with movies as well, so no need for iPhoto BUT this only works with videos that YOU shot on the device. If someone sends you a video and you save it to your albums, then Image Capture ignores it.\n\nA: This isn't exactly a \"simple\" approach at first glance but really can be quite streamlined and reasonably easy. Honestly, there aren't (m)any good ways to sync videos between iOS and OSX - unlike images. \nI personally use iPhoto for situations like you describe:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install iPhoto (if you don't have it already), and open it.\n\n*Attach your iPhone to your computer using your USB cord.\n\n*When prompted, import \"Photos\" (videos will import as well)\n\n*Select the video you would like to have on your desktop (a yellow border will appear)\n\n*Still in iPhoto, click \"File\" > \"Reveal in Finder\" > \"Original\".\n\n*Copy the selected file that appears in Finder to your desktop, or any desired location.\n\n\nA: If you don't want to run iPhoto just for that, and you're happy looking at the files at a slightly lower level, then iFunBox is useful. It shows the Photo Album of the device as a digital camera (DCIM) directory so you can see all the files, then copy to/from your Mac.\nThere's a Windows version too, which has proved useful in the past.\n\nA: I have Iphone5 and MacBook Pro. I easily transferred 12GB of videos to Mac.\nI used Iphoto only as a file transferring app. I didn't open any file in Iphoto.\nHere's what I did:\nHave a clear desktop on screen. Open finder and put to left hand side of screen so that it is visible when you open Iphoto.\nIn finder create a new file for your videos.\nOpen Iphoto.\nOn left side of Iphoto click Photos.\nPlug iphone into usb.\nImages auto load into New Photos.\nSelect video, photo or all.\nClick Import Selected.\nWait.\nDelete off phone? Yes because videos use lots of storage.\nSelect video, photo or multiples and drag to the finder file.\nWait.\nDelete vids and phots from Iphoto.\nOpen video and enjoy!\n\nA: The new slickier Photos app from Apple is the way to go now. :)\nJust connect your iPhone and click the Import tab.\n", "Q: Does anybody use an external battery for iPhone? Do external batteries for iPhones work well?\nI have an iPhone 4S \nFor example, is it true that I can charge up to 6 times my iphone with this product?\n\nA: Yes - and most people I know fit into strongly preferring a rechargeable solution when they use the device regularly to extend power on the go.\nThose that use the device occasionally or on long trips seem to gravitate to an inexpensive sled for AA batteries and carry a mix of expensive lithium cells and typical non-rechargeable cells.\n", "Q: How can I sync sent mail from another device on my iPad?

I have a Mac that runs Snow Leopard and I intend to upgrade it to Mountain Lion and sell it on ebay. However, I only have one hard-drive, and I'm sure I can't use something in my OS to delete my OS and all user data.\nIs there something for this that's built into the firmware that I can do on boot, or otherwise? \nI have source code on my Mac for multiple corporations' proprietary software and I can't risk somebody gaining access through the use of any sort of disk recovery tool. I plan to use a 7 pass erase rather than simply deleting the directory.\n\nA: If others have Lion or a later version of OS X, you can erase and reinstall OS X from the recovery partition. See http://support.apple.com/kb/PH11273.\n\n\n*\n\n*Restart and hold command-R on startup.\n\n*Open Disk Utility and erase either the main OS X partition (like Macintosh HD, indented below the drive) or whole drive. If you have an HDD and not an SSD, you can erase the data securely by pressing the Security Options button and choosing for example the 3-pass erase option.\n\n\n*Quit Disk Utility and choose Install OS X.\nIt is not necessary to delete your user account before you erase the partition or drive.\nIf you don't have other partitions like a Bootcamp partition, you can just erase the main OS X partition. That's what the KB article linked above means by startup disk. If you erase the whole drive, it also erases the recovery partition which is hidden from Disk Utility. If you don't restart the Mac, the contents of the recovery partition will be loaded in memory and you can continue to reinstall OS X. If you do restart the Mac, the drive will now be empty, but if the Mac has firmware support for Internet Recovery mode, it can still start up in Internet Recovery mode, which means that it downloads a disk image for the recovery system from Apple's servers, and you can then reinstall OS X normally.\nIf you have an SSD, the Security Options button is grayed out. According to http://support.apple.com/kb/ht3680 erasing the drive normally might be secure enough:\n\nNote: With OS X Lion and an SSD drive, Secure Erase and Erasing Free Space are not available in Disk Utility. These options are not needed for an SSD drive because a standard erase makes it difficult to recover data from an SSD. For more security, consider turning on FileVault 2 encryption when you start using the SSD drive.\n\nI don't know if it's actually possible to recover data with software like DataRescue after erasing data from an SSD normally, but it might also depend on what SSD you have. To make sure that the data can't be recovered, turn on FileVault 2 from System Preferences before you erase the partition or drive.\n\nA: On Snow Leopard, you would need to boot from an external OS to wipe the drive.\nOn Mountain Lion (or Lion), the system makes a recovery HD so you can self-wipe the Mac. This is a much, much faster and easier task, so I recommend you upgrade first and then do the wiping using a recovery boot and Disk Utility.\nI personally would do these steps (and you could skip the first three steps if you wish since things are going to get erased later whether you clean up first or not):\n\n\n*\n\n*Make a new admin account on Snow Leopard - call it Apple or something generic and set it to be the account that logs into the Mac.\n\n*Log out of all accounts and reboot\n\n*Delete your account and let the system do a quick delete of the content\n\n*Install Lion or Mountain Lion\n\n*Install updates to the OS and then shut down the Mac\n\n*Reboot into OS X Recovery - hold down Command-R during startup\n\n*Use Disk Utility to do a seven pass erase or whatever level of wiping you prefer.\n\n*Quit Disk Utility to go back to the main Recovery menu\n\n*Reinstall your OS on the cleanly wiped drive from the main menu\n\n*Power off the Mac once the OS has been installed so that the buyer gets that \"Welcome to the Mac\" experience but no chance to recover your files or data\n\n\nIf I were doing erasing of a personal Mac, I would do a one pass zero and then enable FileVault on Mountain Lion. That would take the zeroes and then encrypt each block securely - so that no two blocks would be identical on the drive. If there were work data, I might repeat zeroing it and turning on a second FileVault pass or follow whatever policy work approves for disposal of confidential data. In reality, anyone that wants to recover data from a one pass write of zeroes needs to take the drive apart in a clean room and image it with some high priced tools, so scrambling things with FileVault seems like enough overkill to me.\nAlso, you might look here for answers and comments on selling a Mac with software that is licensed for download like Lion and Mountain Lion - most people ask the seller for an email and gift the purchase to them so that the buyer has a legitimate copy. My steps above won't keep your Apple ID on the Mac and the intaller self-deletes itself, so at worst, the seller could undelete that one file and recover the Apple ID email you used. To counter that, you could boot into recovery after the OS was installed and wipe the free space using Disk Utility.\n\n\n*\n\n*Reinstall Mac OS X Mountain Lion before selling a Mac\n\n*Where can I get a copy of Mountain Lion that I can resell with my Apple hardware?\n", "Q: How to disable location services? (MacOSX 10.6.8) I just downloaded an application, that asked me permission to figure my location. I said \"OK, let's see what happens\". \nNext thing I know, my lat/long with 4 decimal places and a pin on a Google map precisely show where I live, That's a bit too accurate for comfort. In 10.6.8, I didn't think it would know my location so well.\n\n\n*\n\n*How did it do that? Did it look up my IP address?\n\n*How do I disable that? I definitely don't want any app to know my location (and send it back to god knows who), with or without my consent. \n\n\nA: \nHow did it do that? Did it look up my IP address?\n\nIt uses a database of WiFi networks your Mac can see and their approximate locations to triangulate your position. This Apple article says:\n\nYour approximate location is determined using information from local Wi-Fi networks, and is collected by Location Services in a manner that doesn’t personally identify you.\n\nThe location of WiFi networks is determined primarily using the GeoIP database and but well-established WiFi networks can report more accurate information to the system. For example, in my neighbourhood where only private citizen WiFi networks are visible to my Apple devices, my location is very approximate. It knows the town, but that's it.\n\nHow do I disable that? I definitely don't want any app to know my location (and send it back to god knows who), with or without my consent.\n\nIn 10.6.8, the only way to get location services is via Safari. The OS didn't have control over location services, it was just a browser feature. To turn off location services for websites in Safari:\n\n\n*\n\n*In Safari select Safari > Preferences… > Privacy (toolbar).\n\n*Select the \"Deny without prompting\" radio button in the 'Limit website access to location services' section of that tab.\n\n\nIf you're running a new OS X you can also turn off location services for apps by doing:\n\n\n*\n\n*Apple () menu > System Preferences… > Security & Privacy > Privacy (tab).\n\n*Select Location Services on the left.\n\n*Uncheck the 'Enable location services' option to turn it off for all apps or uncheck just the apps you don't want to have access to location services.\n\n", "Q: Cannot find image saved to cloud from preview I wanted to post a cropped image on FaceBook.\nI scanned the image into preview (import from scanner), cropped it and when \"save in the cloud\" was suggested I was quite happy to save it there.\nThen I clicked image in FaceBook, clicked photos, but could not find the image anywhere.

I am currently running Parallels 7 to use windows applications, however, games do not run efficiently and I heard Bootcamp is better for gaming.\nI tried installing bootcamp but soon enough I ran into a problem where the laptop did not turn on as usual (took a few tries before opening the log in page). Hence I quickly deleted it and got parallels instead. That was long ago, and now I want to switch back to bootcamp to play some games.\nHowever, I do not know what things I should look for to successfully install bootcamp.\nMy rMBP has the following specifications, how much shall I give bootcamp ? or is it decided on it's own ?\n\n\n*\n\n*2.6 Ghz i7\n\n*16GB DDR3 RAM\n\n*OS X 10.8.2\n\n*GT 650M 1024MB\n\n\nPlus, how do I ensure that I do not run into problems when using Bootcamp ? Is Bootcamp worth it ? What problems might I face when using Bootcamp ?\n\nA: I've never run into any issues like that using Bootcamp. Bootcamp allows you to natively boot into Windows instead of OSX, so it gets all of your resources. All the processor cores, all the RAM, and the entire graphics card. The only decision you have to make is how big your partition has to be for Windows.\nHow much space you assign to Windows depends on how much stuff you plan on putting in your Windows installation. Windows 7 itself takes close to 16 GB of hard drive space. You'll want plenty more for game installations, Windows Updates, and other things.\nUnfortunately this decision has to be made upfront, and changing the size later down the road isn't straight forward (though possible). You can repartition the drive, but the Windows NTFS partition is not going to expand to use the unallocated disk space. That usually requires booting into another linux OS and extending the partition. This in itself has always been somewhat risky. If you do end up having to resize partitions, backup both OSX and Windows completely.\nI've had little to no problems using Bootcamp. Perhaps it's matured more since you last used it. The only problem I run into is Windows will only ever see the discrete GPU, so the battery doesn't last terribly long.\n", "Q: Why won't Office 2011 install on Snow Leopard?

In a few weeks, I will have the iPhone 4. I won't take data with SMS-call hours. But I love taking pictures wherever I go, and the geo-tagging feature is a great thing.\nDoes the iPhone 4 geo-tag pictures usefully even without data?\n\nA: Yes; The Geo tags are written into the images via the native Location Services within the phone, primarily via the GPS chip the phone contains.\nSince the information written is merely latitude/longitude, you do not need to have a data connection in order for that information to be determined and added.\nThe need for a data connection in tandem with photos is the ability to place them on a map, when using iPhoto for example.\n", "Q: If I delete an episode from my iPhone, will it still be available on iTunes? I want to delete an episode from my iPhone so I can watch a different episode (because I took up so much space with music and such).  If I do, it won't permanently delete, will it?   Will it still be on the iTunes account, but not on this device?\n\nA: It depends on two things:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you have a computer or another device set to automatically download purchases, you will have that copy as long as it is online and the download completes successfully.\n\n*If your account is in a country that allows TV eposides to be re-downloaded (usually called iTunes in the cloud) you could re-download the episode later as long as the studio doesn't withdraw it from sale or download.\n\n", "Q: Syncing individual app data with iCloud This is a stupid question, but I just got an iPad mini for Christmas.  I have an iPod touch, and want to sync my app data for my games, etc., across devices.  Does this happen automatically through iCloud?\n\nA: No - iCloud doesn't let you choose things to sync so the developer of each app you run needs to decide how and when to incorporate support for iCloud.\nIt's not such a silly question since I can't seem to find any Apple web page that explains this plainly.\nAs you find things that don't work with iCloud, you can pester the developer (kill them with praise and high marks even if you feel you want to give them a bad rating since you can expect them to please their fans first if they have any doubts about which tasks to add to their apps).\n", "Q: How to reset MacBook Air that is booted but shows no screen?

When I two-finger scroll too quickly with my 2009 MBP trackpad, the scrolling is jerky and can skip many pages in a document. So you're scrolling a 25 page document, you are at page 2, you scroll quickly to get to page 10 and suddenly you are page 22... \nI cannot replicate this with a mouse no matter how fast I scroll and I don't see a setting for trackpad scrolling speed.

Here is my problem. I have a 1 TB external disk that was used half for Time Machine and half for general storage, partition called Mac Swap. In order to make a more elegant back up, I replaced my Time Machine with a full 2 TB external disk. This allowed me to delete the old half (just rendered obsolete) and extend the Mac Swap half to a full 1 TB. But that is where I got stuck. I can't extend the partition, Mac Swap. \nCommand+S only works on the boot disk, right? /sbin /fsck -fy won't solve this. \nBut on the bright side, it seemed to repair a few minor errors on my boot disk. \nPlease help.\n\nA: I found my silly error. The solution: in Disk Utility, I chose specifically the partition that wasn't able to increase in size, then I ran the verification. It turned up problems so I ran the repair command. Then I was able to increase the size of the partition. Mt external hard disk, Mac Swap, is now only one partition. \nTo be clear about my error, in case you're reading this for help. In Disk Utility, there is always both an icon for the disk as a whole and below it immediately there will be all of its partitions. If you run the verification on the hard disk as a whole, then it may not catch what's wrong on your partition. \n\nA: This error was resolved for me by doing this on the original mac I formatted the drive with. I have two macbooks and I was using my second one to re-partition which caused the error. Going back to the macbook I formatted it on, let me re-partition without issue. I don't know any other fix to this or if the other methods work.\n\nA: My external disk was originally in NTFS format with only one partition. The Disk Utility shows two levels for this disk. It always failed to erase this disk when I directly chose the sub-level with disk name on it. As inspired by seano23's answer, I chose the top-level and selected mac map and extended journal format to erase with. The process is successfully done.\nHope my experience could be helpful.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro and external monitor compatibility I just bought my first Mac (to learn to build apps!).

With Proximac, it can force App to use SOCKS5 proxy. In the other words, it can forward any App's traffic to a specified SOCKS5 proxy. Moreover, Proximac now can forward all network traffic in your system to a proxy which means you may not need a VPN to do this job. I hope more developers can join this project.\n\nA: The alternative I use is Hotspot Shield\nIf you are running Steam, remember to launch it with -tcp as follows:\nopen /Applications/Steam.app --args -tcp\n\n\nA: Spotflux provides a managed and trusted connection to the internet that immediately reacts to and protects against emerging threats and unwanted tracking that affect mobile devices and desktop computers.\nAnother alternative exists in the form of extensions for Chrome & firefox:\n\n\n*\n\n*Mediahint\n\n*Hola Unblocker\nI have however only tried these extensions on the aforementioned web browsers on the Windows platform, and as yet have not tried them on OS X.\n\nA: Privoxy does a good job - can be customised or used in standard configuration.

I'm eager to make the most of it that I can, for both personally and for work.\nIn order for me to be able to use it for work, I really need to find a solution that works seamlessly with DropBox to provide client-side encryption for my files.  \nDespite searching for hours (days) and downloading and trying all manner of offerings, I just can't find anything that works.  The closest I've seen so far is BoxCryptor, but that only works if I manually upload the file via the BoxCryptor client.  I want something that will work seamlessly so that Notebooks (or EverNote, etc) think they're using DropBox directly, but the files are being encrypted / decrypted just before they enter or leave DropBox.\nAny clues?\nMichael\n\nA: I use a program called 1Password for secure encryption of files (and other data) and it almost does what you ask. \nOn my Mac client - it can attach arbitrary files to any entry and securely encrypt them before they get stored into Dropbox, but that isn't the primary purpose of the tool. It has an iOS client that can see files attached in this manner, but not really open them, send them to other programs and it also doesn't let you file things.\nSo - what you ask is clearly something that could be programmed, but isn't something where there are several well-known solutions and people will just propose several. In fact, there may not be a single solution that uses Dropbox despite how popular and prevalent it has become.\nI would suggest you consider Box.net which seeks to be a more enterprise secure version of Dropbox - especially if no-one else has a better suggestion than mine for securing your files before they hit Dropbox.\n\nA: All your data between your device and the Dropbox storage is encrypted so that no one could sniff your transfers and get your data.  Your iPad is most likely the weak link depending on how protected you have it.\nThere isn't a native way to do it only with Dropbox.  To be completely protected, you will have to use some other application to encrypt the file then save it into your Dropbox.  That could be BoxCryptor, 1Password, etc.\nAnd along the lines of a more enterprise version of Dropbox, I'd have to recommend Syncplicity.  I have the Business Edition and it is great.  Allows employees to share files directly without having to email or copy the file to another box.  I have management controls to limit what they can do like if they are allowed to save the file off to an SD card (Android devices) in unencrypted format, remote wipe of all the files, etc.\nOne drawback with Syncplicity is that no third party apps are using it for syncing like with Dropbox and Box.net.  Syncplicity is a smaller company but this last year they were acquired by EMC Corporation (a huge world wide storage company) so I hope they push it make Syncplicity more common.\n\nA: The best solution that I found so far is Outline+.  It fantastically handles OneNote notebooks.\nIt allows me to sync automatically via DropBox, which I use for my non-secret notebooks, and (very) manually exchange notebooks direcetly between my PC and iPad via iTunes.  As this exchange is direct to my PC and not via a third party I'm comfortable using it for my confidential stuff.\nOutline+ Enterprise is in development, and promises client-side encrypted notebooks - that should eliminate the current manual copying via iTunes.\n\nA: For MAC OSX machines you can use GPGTools:https://gpgtools.org to encrypt any files using PGP on the client before uploading to DropBox.  PGP uses a public key and private key that can be stored in the keychain or entered manually. GPG tools can encyrpt and sign emails, as well as encrypt individual files or folder with up to 4096 bit RSA encryption.  You either upload your public key to different public key servers for friends to retrieve your public key.  You can also select 2048 bit RSA encryption. \nAt the current rate of computing power growth or using the worlds fastest supercomputer it will take about 100 years to break 4096 bit PGP encryption.   GPGtools has two versions; one for just the Mac OSX email client and a Suite which includes email, file, and folder encryption. I recommend downloading the suite. \niCloud uses 1024 bit RSA encryption so GPGtools 4096 bit encryption is much much stronger and cannot be broken without you revealing your secret key.  Choose a long Mnemonic phrase that you CAN EASILY REMEMBER to create the the Public and Private pair of encryption keys i.e \"TheReasonILoveNewYorKCityisthegreatnightlifeandbars\"  If you don't save the phrase to \nthe keychain or forget it you WILL NOT be able to recover or open any of your encrypted files, folders or emails.  \nGPGTools is open source shareware, it's very simple to use, it has a nice GUI,  or you use the built in command line window.  Stay safe and use strong encryption for your important documents stored on cloud based services like DropBox.\n", "Q: How to backup iPhone by iTunes? I'm new to iTunes and everything doesn't make sense for me.\nI need to do backup of contacts, photos and music on my iPhone.\nI've tried to follow several manuals how to do backup on my Windows PC but can't pass few steps.\n\n\n*\n\n*My iPhone is connected by USB cable and is detected by iTunes\n\n*I can't select anything from iTunes -> File -> Devices as all functions are grayed out\n\n*In many manuals peoples refer that I have to turn off iCloud. I dont't see iCloud anywhere on iTunes or iPhone\n\n\nA: By the wording in your question - it appears that two things are in order:\n\n\n*\n\n*Short answer on what a backup is\n\n*Short answer on how to start one\n\n\nAnswering the how to backup is easiest. From the view menu, be sure you choose \"Show Sidebar\" so that you have a place in the main iTunes window to see the device when it gets connected over USB. Make sure the main window of iTunes is visible and connect your phone. If you have a Mac, the phone usually shows up under Devices within half a second or two. On a PC, you may need to wait for antivirus scanners, or the OS to recognize the device and perform a step or two in the OS to allow the computer to talk to the phone. It too should eventually show up in the sidebar. Either way, once it appears, use the mouse to click once on it. It should show the summary tab, but if not, click that at the top of the window just below and to the right of the play/pause button.\nNow iTunes will show you one of many screens to manage the device where it normally shows the store or your music library. \n\nHere you can see on the left where the device might be configured to back up to iCloud. You can change that or leave it as it appears. On the right, you can click Back Up Now and get a local backup.\nNow to answer the \"what is backed up\" - you can read over this article while your backup is running. HT4946: iTunes: About iOS backups In particular, music is not backed up since it either came from a computer or from the cloud, so iTunes and iOS assume you back up your computer and they back up the cloud so you don't need to waste space on your computer and time backing up something that was just synced to the iOS device as opposed to being created there or only being stored there.\nOnce your backup is complete - click on the info tab and perhaps consider syncing the contents from addresses and calendars which will make a copy of that data available on your computer as opposed to having it stored away in a backup file where you can't really get to the contacts other than restoring them again onto a phone (replacing the contacts that were on that device in the process).\n\nA: As for iTunes 11.0.2.26 on April 2013\n\n\n*\n\n*Open iTunes\n\n*Click top left little icon. It will give you the option to Show\nMenu Bar.\n\n*When this appears, click on View / Show Side Bar.

It just doesn't work.\nOn your phone, tap Settings>iCloud> and then turn off Contacts and Calendars. Turn on Mail, Reminders, Safari, Notes, Passbook, Photo Stream, Documents and Data, Find My iPhone.Exit out of Settings.\nOn your PC, connect your iPhone via USB cable. iTunes may open automatically. If not, open iTunes manually. \nClick on the iPhone \"icon\" on the top RHS of the screen. A new page will open with the options \"Summary, Info, Apps, Tones, Music, Movies, TV Shows, Photos, On This iPhone\". Click on \"Summary\" if that page isn't already open.\nSelect Automatically backup \"TO THIS COMPUTER\". Select options \"Automatically sync when this iPhone is connected\", \"Sync with this phone over wi-fi\". The other options are up to you.\nClick on \"Info\". I run Microsoft Outlook 2010 on my PC. Therefore, on the \"Info\" page I checked \"Sync Contacts with\" Outlook, \"Sync Calendars with\" Outlook and \"Sync Mail with\" Outlook.

What are my options?\nUnfortunately, using the USB port of the digital camera is not an option as my camera does not have one.\nEDIT\nAccording to several forums, using a USB memory card reader with the camera connection kit used to work, but recent CCKs apparently do not supply the necessary power for USB memory card readers anymore, so a normal reader might not work.\n\nA: *\n\n*Buy a USB memory card reader that supports MS Duo cards. Make sure that it is compatible with OS X.\n\n*Attach the card reader to a powered USB hub and connect that to the USB port of your Camera Connection Kit. Insert the card in the reader. Attach the kit to the iPad.\n\n\nA: One option is to put a MS Duo to MicroSD card adapter in your camera, then put the MicroSD card in the Camera Connection Kit's SD Card reader (via a MicroSD to SD card adapter).\n", "Q: Mountain Lion always switches to previous application at wake up Since upgrading to Mountain Lion (from Snow Leopard), I have noticed that always when I wake up my MacBook Pro, a window from the previously active application is moved to the front.\nWhat causes this?\nCan I turn this \"feature\" off?\n\nA: Thanks Daniel Lawson for pointing to the solution:\nThe issue is cause by the 'require password after sleep or screen saver begins' option in the system security settings. If you turn this off, the issue disappears.\n", "Q: Itunes Library main vs shared I recently moved by itunes library from my pc to an external hard drive and updated to itunes 11.0.  After doing this, when I click on my music I can see two separate libraries.  One is just under Library as music.  Then there is a second one listed below that says Shared Library and refers to the external hard drive.  Some of the songs from albums are missing in the main libary but are present on the Shared Library.   Do I need both of these libraries and if so is there a way to update the main library to get these missing songs from the shared library? \n\nA: Okay this is what I would recommend.Follow the steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Clear Out your iTunes Library completely\n\n*Copy the contents from your hard disk to a place on your Computer\n\n*Add the folder from your computer to your iTunes Library and you will get back your old  arrangement of songs. \n\n\nHope this helps!\n\nA: It's not clear how or why you want two libraries, but you can switch between both by quitting iTunes and holding the Shift (PC) or Option (Mac) key.\n\n\n*\n\n*HT1589 - How to open an alternate iTunes Library file or create a new one\nThen you can export the playlists and everything about the library to your desktop as FileA.xml. Quit and repeat for the other library and make FileB.xml. Then you can choose to merge or not the files and songs / make your one library be the one you like and then import the two xml files to recreate whatever playlists you are missing. It's far easier to clean things up and have one library (a folder with all the iTunes database files) sitting in your user home folder and either store all the media there or store all the media on an external drive. Once you understand how to export the playlists and settings, it's much easier to change storage plans.\n", "Q: Can I use an iPhone to remote desktop to a PC, show the desktop on a TV with airplay, and use the iphone as a touchpad for the remote desktop? I've seen descriptions of running an RDP client on the iPhone.  I've also seen descriptions of using the iPhone as a touchpad/mouse replacement for a PC.  But I haven't seen a description of a combined application that shows the remote desktop screen via AirPlay (to an Apple TV) on a TV while enabling the iPhone to act as a touchpad for that remote desktop.  It would make the iPhone/AppleTV/TV combo a complete remote desktop solution without additional hardware (other than a network).\n\nA: This works out of the box with AirPlay mirroring and any RDC client such as Screens for iOS. \nJust establish a remote connection then double tap your home button and swipe the multitasking bar to the right. Enable AirPlay mirroring and you'll have what you described.\n", "Q: iOS kindle app - where is the anotations file? When using my kindle I can make all manner of annotations, which I can then view on the book I have anotated. This is also true of my kindle iOS app.  \nHowever, the kindle itself has a document on it called something like 'my annotations', which constains all the notes I've written on any book (this is handy when the note I've written on the book is something like 'buy milk'), but my iOS kindle app doesn't have this 'my annotations' document. Can someone tell me either how to get the same functionality out of the app, or why this is the case? \n\nA: iDevices don't allow direct access to the data files like other tablets which is why you can't see the 'my annotations' file.\nHowever, the iOS version of Kindle app has a nice feature to backup your highlights and annotations to your amazon.com account.  You can enable it by clicking on the Settings (Gear) icon in the lower right corner, select Other, and turn on \"Annotations Backup\".\nNext go to http://kindle.amazon.com and log in with your Amazon account.  Click on the Your Highlights link at the top and you will be presented with a list of all your highlights/annotations for all your books.\n", "Q: Bootcamp assistant won't let me increase the Windows partition I'm trying to install Windows 7 on my Mac. The Bootcamp Assistant won't let me increase the Windows partiton's size above ~45 GB. I've got 200 GB free out of 500 GB on my SSD.\nI run Disk Repair, but that didn't help. Do I have to buy iDefrag and defrag my disk, or are there other options (besides reinstalling OS X from a backup)?\n\nA: I think alimack is right, has to do with contiguous space.  I resolved without purchasing idefrag.   Heres how.  In my case I had a 250gb drive and was only using about 50gb.   Boot camp was only allowing me to create a 125gb partition for windows.   I accepted that and partitioned the drive in boot camp. Before installing windows I rebooted the Mac OS, went into Disk Utilities and then deleted the windows partition.  Now start again and run bootcamp and you will find a lot more space is available for your windows partition.\n\nA: I had the same issue, the problem for me was that the bootcamp manager only allowed me to take up space from allocated partitions.\nGo into Disk Utility, select your 500GB SSD and select the \"Partition\" tab.\nMake sure that \"Macintosh HD\" is taking up all the 500GB.\n\nA: I've seen exactly the same problem, and solved it with iDefrag, the partitioning tool needs contiguous space, not just space.  The only other option is to wipe the drive.  There are other defrag tools but they're not as good.\nI think iDefrag is the best available option (assuming you're using a standard HDD, don't defrag solid state drives)\n", "Q: Why doesn't my MacBook Pro automatically reconnect to the Wi-Fi when resuming from sleep? I have a 2012 MacBook Pro with Retina display (currently running Mountain Lion v10.8.2).\nEvery time I wake it up from sleep (open the lid), it doesn't seem to automatically re-connect to the Wi-Fi network. If I manually click on the connect button, it works fine. I'm fairly sure this used to work.\nHow can I fix this?\n\nA: It should automatically reconnect but it might take a couple of seconds, more depending on the speed of your wireless router.  How long are you waiting?\nIt will automatically join a network if you have configured it to remember networks you have previously joined.  You can check this in the System Preferences>Network page. Click on the WiFi entry then on the Advanced button.  In the Wi-Fi tab is a list of Preferred Networks.  Make sure your network is listed, with the correct security mode.  If it is listed but not at the top, perhaps the laptop is trying other networks first.  Move your preferred network to the top of the list.\nIf that still doesn't work, try deleting it from the list, click OK, click Apply.  Then turn off the Wifi by clicking the \"Turn WiFi off\" button above.  Then turn it back on and choose your network, making sure that it is set to remember.  Save/Apply and close the System Preferences and try sleeping again.\n\nA: Change the routers security to WEP and this problem goes away.\nHowever WEP security is less secure and you may have to choose between the lesser of the two evils.\n", "Q: Isolate OSX Dock per Space How can I make it so that each space has its own isolated dock?\nBasically what I'm looking for is:\n\n\n*\n\n*The dock in one space should not show the icon of an app that was open in another space.\n\n*If I have the same program open in two different spaces, clicking on the icon in one space should not go to the app in the other space.\nIs this possible natively, or with a third party program?\n\nA: As mentioned in the Independent docks across displays thread, you can't do it with the native Dock system.  You will need a third party utility like DockSpaces.\n", "Q: Setting caps lock key to CTRL but still function as caps lock if I press for long enough I just started out using tmux, so I figured I would set my Caps lock key equal to the Ctrl key.\nThough sometimes I do need the Caps lock key. I don't care if it requires playing with the Terminal or system files, I'm not afraid of that. However it would be nice if I could just run Terminal commands so that I can put it in a script. Also, if possible, it would be nice if it doesn't require extra software, although if it's necessary then there's no problem.\nHow can I make it so that it's normally a Ctrl key, but if I press it for say 5 seconds it triggers a normal Caps lock. I was wondering, how can I do this?\n\nA: Using KeyRemap4MacBook, you could add this to private.xml:\n<autogen>--HoldingKeyToKey-- KeyCode::CONTROL_L, KeyCode::CONTROL_L, KeyCode::VK_NONE, KeyCode::CAPSLOCK, Option::NOREPEAT</autogen>\nThe threshold for holding a key is 0.2 s by default, but it can be changed in the second tab.\nThis would change fn+caps lock (control) to caps lock:\n<autogen>--KeyToKey-- KeyCode::CONTROL_L, ModifierFlag::FN, KeyCode::CAPSLOCK</autogen>\n", "Q: Facebook messages causing the Facebook app on my iPad to crash I have an iPad mini, updated to iOS 6. I can use my Facebook app well in every department apart from messages. In both the top display and side display, when I click on the messages option the Facebook app will crash. I have tried uninstalling the app, restarting, installing and restarting, but nothing improves or changes. Also I have tried the proper restart by holding down both the top lock/unlock button and home button but that has not worked either. \nIs there anything else I can do to fix this crashing problem?\n\nA: It's not clear if this is a bug that needs to be fixed with a new release of e program, but you could follow this path and try reinstalling the older version of the app from a computer and or computer backup.\nWhat can we do now that Facebook iPad app crashes on launch after update?\n", "Q: How can I delete photos from camera roll and leave in an album? I created a named album on my iPhone and placed photos from my camera roll in there. I would then like to delete these photos from the camera roll. However, when I try to do so an error messages warns that the photos (which currently reside in the the camera roll and named album) will also be deleted from the album. \nIs there a way to delete the photos from the camera roll and leave them in the specific album?\n\nA: You can't. iOS uses a simple photo database, very similar to iPhoto. Primary storage for all photo image data and metadata (time, place, exposure, etc) is the camera roll. This system lets you create the illusion of multiple albums, and storing photos in the albums.\nBut from a database perspective, your album is just a table with the image ID of every photo you place in it, creating a link back to the image data in the camera roll.\nYou can delete photos from albums, thereby removing them from the table. \nWhen you delete a photo from the camera roll, you delete the photo from the system.\n", "Q: What software can find close duplicates from 2TB worth of pictures? I have collected all of my photographs onto one hard drive. I'm looking for software that runs on Mountain Lion to assist in finding similar photos so I can review and eliminate redundant files.\nMy picture store is currently 2 TB, so batch and/or efficient software would be ideal. I know for certain that there are a lot of duplicates, and there are lots of programs out there which can find exact duplicates.\nWhat I am looking for is something which will find:\n\n\n*\n\n*pictures which are identical except for rotation\n\n*pictures which are identical except for size (i.e. an original vs a thumbnail from iPhoto, or an original vs a downsized version for the web, etc)\n\n*pictures which are similar\n\n\nI assume #1 is possible, but I am not sure about #2 or #3. What software can do any or all of these tasks?\n\nA: The best that I could find and have used is Duplicate Annihilator, which works with iPhoto, and is upgraded for 10.8.  You can download and do a run and hopefully get rid and clean your folders the first time through.  For what you need you might need a few passes to get the obvious dups, then find the harder to get ones.\nhttp://www.brattoo.com/propaganda/\nI am not exactly sure it will find your #2 and #3 right out of the gate, but since photos are marked with unique timestamps and other meta data, it should find them even if rotated.  The similar part is a bit harder as the criteria for similar could be many things.

Install with brew (brew install jdupes)\nPhotoSweeper will do at least #2 and #3. You can get a demo with limited deletion and unlimited identification. Price is more than reasonable given the time you will save.

I have to install Windows XP on my mid-2012 Mountain Lion MacBook Air (base config: 4GB RAM, 128GB SDD, 1.8 GHz) but the BootCamp doesn't support anything except 7.\nI can't afford to set aside sth like 15-25 GB for Win 7.\nHow can I do it? Can I downgrade BootCamp in Mountain Lion to a previous version which supported XP and then install XP?\nOr if I can create an empty FAT partition and later simply reboot and insert Windows XP insert USB drive(non disc drive) and go on with XP installation?\nUpdate: I have to use that XP partition for gaming purposes so virtual machines are not an option. They eat up too much resource for let me game on my 4GB MBA. I've tried. My problem with 7 and 8 is that they will probably gobble ~30% of my disk space for just the OS.\nLooks like there's really no way. Besides, I've got those games on Steam for Linux/Mac now. So, I don't even want to go near a Windows machine anymore. Thanks for answering. I think I shall close this question from further posts if possible.\n\nA: As far as I know there is no way to dual-boot any Mac with Bootcamp and Windows XP. It is simply not supported. Bootcamp under Lion and Mountain Lion should be able to support Windows 7 or Windows 8; can't you use one of them to run your Windows software instead of Windows XP?\nIf you cannot use Bootcamp, then you should evaluate the commercial virtualization products VMware Fusion for Mac and Parallels Desktop. Either of those can run Windows XP. Perhaps they can give you enough system speed for your gaming needs.\n\nA: I use WinXP (and Win7) inside VirtualBox. MBA also mid 2012.\n\nA: Summary: there is no way to do what I asked in the question. \n", "Q: How reliable is Find My iPhone \"Erase My Mac\" feature? I recently had a Macbook Pro stolen. I used Find My iPhone \"Erase\" feature which after two days claimed to have worked. But how reliable is this? The computer had a 500Gb SSD in it, and warns that it could take up to a day to complete the erase. Does anyone know if the \"Erased successfully\" message is sent after the erase has complete, or at the start of it being instigated by iCloud, as presumably someone could pull the power / turn it off, and prevent the erase completing (if the message were sent at the start)?\nNOTE: There was (stupidly of me) no security / encryption on the drive but I did set the passcode when I used the erase feature of FMi\n\nA: This macobserver.com article details the procedure that is set into action when you click that big red 'Wipe Mac' button, and how that data could be recovered.\nIn conclusion...\n\n  \n*\n  \n*A remote lock state limits boot options on the Mac, but can still be circumvented by pulling the drive and mounting it on another computer.\n  \n*A remote wipe wipes all internal drives and, once complete, leaves access only to the Recovery Partition.\n  \n\nThis Apple knowledgebase article also mentions that\n\nIf the device is online, the remote erase begins within seconds (if the device is a Mac, it also restarts before it’s erased), and a confirmation email is sent to your Apple ID email address (the one you use with iCloud).\n\n\nA: If you manually wipe a Retina iMac (Flash drive) it finishes in 3 seconds, not 1 day. It is very fast, it directly formats it and maybe that same procedure occurs in the FMi option.\n", "Q: On find my iphone, if my 'pending: Lock Mac' is not there, does that mean it has been locked? My mac was stolen and I went on find my iphone to take the next steps :\n\n\n*\n\n*I tried to locate it, but it was offline (probably because there was no battery at the time it was stolen).\n\n*So next, I decided to Lock it.

I have iCloud set up on all three devices, but email messages deleted on one device don't also get deleted on other two devices. How do I fix this?\n\nA: I haven't seen iCloud fail like this other than when there is an outage for the server hosting my mail. You could check for this by disabling mail on all devices and then re-enabling it so that whatever is present on the iCloud mail server syncs down to each device in turn. You might also power off each device when iCloud mail is off to ensure any cleanup scripts run at boot to clear any caches, but I've not seen this to be needed in experience so far.\nWorst case, you would need to open a ticket with iCloud support if the things you can control (like enabling / disabling / rebooting and if needed, restoring the devices) fails to remedy this sync issue.\n", "Q: Remove application from App Store's Update section I've got an application in my Updates list which I never installed.

I tried to alt-boot, got into Mountain Lion's recovery options and reinstalled the system, but with the same result. Is the terminal in the recovery tool to any help?\nIs this setting saved in a file I can restore from Time Machine?\n\nA: You should be able to fix this in single-user mode. Restart the Mac while holding the Command and S keys; it'll start into a full-screen command-line environment, with none of the usual daemons even trying to run. As usual, the first two things to do in single-user more are to check/repair and mount the startup volume. To check/repair it, run the command /sbin/fsck -fy and wait for it to finish. If it prints \" The volume was modified \", run it again and keep running it until it finishes with \"** The volume  appears to be OK.\" Once the startup volume is OK, mount it with /sbin/mount -uw /\nOnce that's done, run the command:\nrm /var/db/launchd.db/com.apple.launchd/overrides.plist\n\n(Note: type this command very carefully. If you thought the damage from mistyping that launchctl command was bad, you haven't seen what a garbled version of this command could do!)\nFinally, run the command reboot and the system should restart normally, with all of the system LaunchDaemons set back to their default states.\n\nA: I would just quit and save any work you can and then reboot at that point.\n sudo shutdown -r now\n\nIf you did manage to unload all the daemons and services, I would install a clean OS onto an external drive (using Mountain Lion recovery) and then migrate the settings over. You also should be able to restore a Time Machine backup, but that would need an erase and then an install, so I prefer to spend the extra $$ on an external hard drive and then after testing the clean OS, migrate your data over.\nThis has a bonus of testing your hardware for failure and delays when you erase the faulty data/drive if you lack a current backup or are not sure you can recover from a backup.\n", "Q: Sharing iTunes account with separate game center accounts We have a family iTunes account. My son wants to have his own Clash of Clans game on his iPod, so we created his own Apple ID and he logged into Game Center from his iPod with the new ID to download the game. However, it automatically reverts back to my husband’s game and the family account.\nHow do we get it to download under his new ID?\n\nA: You will need to check the settings app and sign out of the App Store for the account you don't want to purchase things. There are about 5 places you can enter an Apple ID in the settings so that you can mix one app for music and apps, another for home sharing, another for iMessage, another for iCloud and another for Game Center.\n\nA: As bmike mentioned, there are multiple places to enter an AppleID to be used with the various Apple services.  Some apps use the main iCloud account where others can be configured to a different ID.\nIf the iPod is primarily for your son, or anyone else, I would recommend setting up the iDevice under his Apple ID then log into the family account for other services.  I do this for my family and with a few minor issues, it works out very well.\nIn the Settings, scroll down to the iCloud option.  That is the primary account for the device.  Configure it to your son's account. (I use the naming scheme of iPerson, like iJason, so when I configure other accounts, I know this one is the iCloud entry)  Enable the apps that will be unique to him (ie Contacts, Reminders, etc).  However, turn off \"Find my iPhone\" here as we will enable it later.\nFYI: All apps will use this account by default, including saving app preferences via the Documents and Data setting.  This will allow each family member to play the same game but each have their own saved preferences (if the app uses iCloud for preferences).  If all the devices were set up under Dad's ID, the preferences could be changed by the wrong family member.\nNow go back to the main Settings and just below the iCloud option is \"Mail, Contacts, Calendars\".  Select this and add a new iCloud account entering your family account info.  (I use the nickname of iFamily).  In here, enable the apps that will be common between all family members.  For example, I use Contacts, Reminders, and Find My iPhone for all family members.  Configuring all your devices to use the same account for Find My iPhone allows you to log into the icloud.com site and see all the devices at once.\nYou can now go back to the main Settings screen and set up the Apple ID for other services to use the iFamily account or each iUser account.\n\n\n*\n\n*Messages: iUser\n\n*FaceTime: iUser\n\n*iTunes & App Stores: iFamily so that any purchase is available to all devices but I recommend you turn off the Automatic Downloads or everyone will get the new item pushed whenever someone else makes a purchase.\n\n*Music: Home Sharing - iFamily\n\n*Videos: Home Sharing - iFamily\n\n*Photos & Camera: iUser but turn on Shared Photo Streams and set up a shared folder for the iFamily account (done in the Photos app).\n\n\nGame Center doesn't (yet) have a Settings entry so you will need to set the Apple ID from within the Game Center app.  Click on the Me tab and scroll down to the Account banner.  If it isn't set to the primary iCloud account already, click the banner and log out/log in to the proper account.\nNot exactly related to Apple ID but still a per user setting is the Twitter and Facebook settings.  You will probably want to set these to the primary device user if they use these services.\nI hope this helps.

The problem is that the foreground apps interrupt the sound of the background radio app. In Windows you can control which programs are allowed to output sound with the volume mixer; similarly, is there any way to lock sound output on an iPad to one background app?\n\nA: Sorry but that isn't possible on an iPad.  Each application/game has the option/ability to allow the background music to continue or to stop it and use its own audio.\nYou would have to ask the developer of each application to add an option to allow the background music to continue instead of interrupting.  Good luck with that. ;)\n", "Q: Which iOS jailbreak apps most closely implement an Android style notification system?

Bought an iPod Touch for my son which I then discovered is a 2nd gen which doesn't support lots of apps and games.

Is there any way to sort or filter iTunes so that the only results I see are the ones which will actually work on 4.2.1?\n\nA: First I would try upgrading the iOS if possible.

A member of my family has a 16GB iPad which keeps reporting that it is out of space. One big occupier of space on the iPad seems to be Photostream pictures. Is there a way to a) figure out how much space Photostream is occupying on the device and b) limit or reduce that space without disabling Photostream entirely? I'd prefer something easy like a preference box I've just overlooked, but some sort of script-based hack that inserts a bunch of minimal-sized photos into the stream to take up space in the 1000 most recent but not take up much storage space could be an option.\nFWIW, our main use for Photostream is to get the pictures taken on the iPad into iPhoto on the Mac automatically, and secondarily to get access on the iPad to photos taken by camera then copied into iPhoto on the Mac. I'd love to be able to still do these things but not have to give up the space to store 1000 photos on the iPad.\n\nA: a) figure out how much space Photostream is occupying on the device\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to settings\n\n*General -> Usage\n\n*wait until the top is done and then click on Photos and Camera\n\n*The next page under Photo and Camera has the space used for Camera Roll, Photo Library, and the Photo Stream.\n\n\nb) reduce space.\nAfter taking photos you can edit and crop, delete the ones that you do not want.  It saves the last 1000 photos for 30 days so if you take a lot of photos, copy them when you can.  Photo stream is there for you to easily sync your photos from one device to all.  After you have the photo, copy it to your mac and remove them from your photo stream.  After 30 days or over 1000 photos you might start to lose photos.\n\nA: What you need is Adobe revel.

In the last few weeks we started to experience various problems like WiFI throughput getting reduced to practically nothing, Time Machine backups failing and the Capsule itself getting inaccessible. These situations can be resolved by power cycling the Capsule (and on the long run by replacing it with a new model).\nIn the meantime, which options do I have to diagnose the problem? I've already looked at the logs via Airport Utility but they don't show anything related to these incidents at all. Are there other options?\n\nA: The main issue you mention of network strength and/or performance degrading should be something you could catch with periodic dumping of the RSSI status using the airport binary. I sym link it to /usr/bin for $PATH reasons and ease of access, but it's really buried in a System framework.\nAir:~ me$ which airport\n/usr/local/bin/airport\nAir:~ me$ ls -l /usr/local/bin/airport\nlrwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel  89 Apr  4  2012 /usr/local/bin/airport -> /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Versions/Current/Resources/airport\n\nIf you were a unix sysadmin type, you would set up SNMP log forwarding on th AirPort/Time Capsule to send all the logs to your Mac and configure syslogd to file those airport messages in a log of your choosing. The Airport Utility version 6 (and the iOS versions) lack the ability to set a SNMP remote log host, so download an older version and maintain a copy of it going forward in case you want this extra functionality.\nThe --getinfo option will let you graph your observed signal and noise levels and you might even automate --scan to see if you can correlate drops to other networks showing up on the same channel with a better signal (or even causing excess noise). Once you've been able to catch 10 failures, you can start going over the logs to see if you can detect any patterns. You'll also need to keep good notes about what you change (and when and why) in terms of reboots, drops, changes to channels, etc...\nDepending on how bored you are, you could script these data collections to append xml or csv and use a spreadsheet to chart the values over time. If you were supremely bored or motivated, set up MRTG - but for most home networks, it is severe overkill to configure let alone maintain.\n", "Q: Can I get iTunes to show all songs with an error status? I'm using iTunes Match on my computer, but I have some titles in my library that are missing the actual media.\nHere is my process: \n\n\n*\n\n*convert a cd to mp3\n\n*put an album in my iTunes\n\n*iTunes Match makes the match\n\n*after that match, I delete the source because it is in the cloud\n\n\nBut when i do that, iTunes puts an exclamation point at the beginning of the line of titles from this album because it cannot find the file anymore. I just have to delete these titles and next time they will be downloaded from the cloud.\nIs there a way to select all these \"not found\" files and delete them at once ? because if i don't do that, next time iTunes will go to such a song, it will skip it instead of downloading from iTunes Match.\nIt would be ideal to sort the list of songs with this special column so I can clean things up.\n\nA: You can add the columns iCloud Status and iCloud Download and sort song lists by those criteria.\nAll songs that didn't upload will include the missing tracks so you can clean them appropriately.\n\nYou could also attack the inverse problem. Make sure everything you care about is in the iCloud and matched. Once that process is complete, you could turn off iTunes Match on that computer, quit iTunes and archive the entire music folder. Then you could delete the library folder and start with a fresh library and turn on match to restore all playlists, metadata, play counts, etc...\nAt that point, you could decide to re-import some or all of the songs so you don't need to download all the music again, but most with broadband are happy to just re-download what they need rather than have everything in one place.\nI have done this exact process, and when I go to iTunes and select a track I want to delete, the following dialog pops up:\n\nIf you are not getting that dialog, then I can only presume some other corruption is present in your Library.\n\nA: Over in the post \"Can I easily view all songs that iTunes can't locate in Finder?\" is a great workaround to this issue.

My ultimate goal would be to click on a pdf file and to have it opened in the tab (within chrome) using skim as the backbone.\nI managed to disable the built in viewer (chrome://plugins/); then, clicking on a pdf simply downloads it, and I can open it with skim. This is cumbersome, and the file is saved locally on my ~/Downloads. Is there a way to make it flow nicer? Is there a way to automatically open the file once downloaded (skim is my default viewer anyway)?\n\nA: If you download a pdf then click on the arrow on the downloaded file button at the bottom of the browser window and select \"Always open files of this type\", then pdf files will be automatically opened by the default application on download - in your case skim.\nThey will still be in the download folder however.\nTo undo this behaviour go into chrome advanced settings and under Download click \"Clear auto-opening sett\n", "Q: Spotlight search iTunes Match Back before I used iTunes Match, I enjoyed being able to search my library via spotlight.

Command+Space) then type a song title, then hit enter to play. I tried quicksilver, but it doesn't appear to support iTunes Match either.

Safari hides the http: or https:, so how can I tell if I'm viewing a page over SSL? Some pages show issuer information in the URL bar, but not all of them. So the ones that show issuer info are secure, but I'd rather not have to reload the other pages in Chrome just to determine whether I have a secure connection to it.\n\nA: Some pages will display the lock icon during loading, then it will disappear.  This is because there is some insecure content on the page, for example Google AdSense ads on a secure page can cause this.\n\nA: As a follow up to the answer by @chrisg I recently noticed that some Safari Extensions will also hide the lock icon, presumably because they send or receive information over http.

It has unfortunately been left to languish & can't handle CoreStorage volumes at all.\nThe only replacement - & actually improvement - on iPartition is now Paragon Hard Disk Manager\nIt can not only resize Bootcamp partitions, it can fix them & even back up or move them to a new drive without breaking anything else in the process.\nFull feature list here - https://www.paragon-software.com/home/hdm-mac/features.html\nno affiliation, merely a satisfied user.\n\nA: For all my partitioning, I use and recommend iPartition.\n\nYou can use iPartition on drives that contain Boot Camp volumes; in fact, you can even resize your Windows partitions, and let iPartition take care of reconfiguring the Windows boot process for you.\n\n", "Q: Bootcamp keyboard driver not installing I am assuming that this is an bug, but I thought I would check with you all first to see if that is the case. \nI had been running OSX 10.6.8 with bootcamp 3.3 and Windows 7 64x PRO. I reloaded it over Christmas, to re-partition my drive. When I reloaded, my function keys were not working. I upgraded my OSX side to Mountain Lion, downloaded bootcamp 4.0 and installed that on my Win7 side, still no joy. \nHere is what is happening. My driver is not installing at all. Even when I go in and try to manually try to install the driver, it comes up with an error that says \"install failed\". I have tried everything, including removing all drivers, and reinstalling them, and all of the other basics. \nTo further muddy the waters, I borrowed an OSX dvd that had bootcamp 3.1 on it. I installed that keyboard driver. Now my internal keyboard works, just like it should, with all of the FN keys performing properly. However, when I try to point my Apple Bluetooth keyboard to use that driver, I simply get an error. \nBottom line is, the 4.0 keyboard driver will not install at all. Built in keyboard is working properly on an old driver. And my Apple bluetooth keyboard FN keys are not working. I am thinking it is a bug with the driver, but does anybody have any ideas for me? \n\nA: Try downloading and installing the Bootcamp Windows Support Software from here.

Theoretically, is it possible to run iOS on a device that doesn't ship with it? I know that Apple signed iOS so it only runs on Apple devices, but is there any hack that could potentially change that?\n\nA: Theoretically? Sure, but it'd be a challenge, and I don't think anyone's done it.\nHowever, you can sort of get it running on a Mac if you have Xcode: Xcode menu > Open Developer Tool > iOS Simulator. This will load a simulator for the iPhone with Photos, Contacts, Settings, Game Center, Maps, Newsstand, Passbook, and Safari.

Then, I got a new Retina MBP, and decided to just stick with iPhoto and test it out.  Since now iPhoto could just natively open my old Aperture library, it was essentially no problem at all.\nHowever, I am now trying to sync a brand new iPad with this Retina MBP, and can't do it.  I get the error that my iTunes library cannot be found. \nI'm assuming this happens because it's, technically speaking, an Aperture library, not an iPhoto library, so as far as iTunes is concerned, there is no iPhoto library.  I also don't have Aperture installed on the new computer (and I'm not really planning on installing it), so I can't tell iTunes to sync with Aperture and its aperture library. \nIs there a way around this? Converting the aperture library into an actual iPhoto library, maybe?  Is there a way to tell iPhoto to turn this aperture library into an iPhoto one? Or to tell iTunes to sync using the aperture library, open in iPhoto?\n\nA: There are many facets to your question and I will try to answer all of them.\n\n\n*\n\n*If the error you are getting is an iTunes library issue, then you should reboot itunes holding down the option key, and browse to the existing library file in /Users/username/Music/iTunes/ this reloads your proper library.\n\n*iPhoto can open your aperture library, however it's usage of RAW files etc, it limited.   this link has some more info about using Aperture library in iPhoto. http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5260\n\n*As the file extension on the library should be .aplibrary you will need to choose aperture from the drop down under Photos in iTunes.  iPhoto is only acting as a viewer for this library, and is not \"holding\" these files.  \n\n*You should be able to choose \"import to library...\" in iPhoto and choose the .aplibrary file and it will import these photos into an iPhoto library.  However, in case you decide to begin using Aperture again, save the aplibrary file. Note:  you may lose some, if not most of the edits made in Aperture. \nQuestion:  Why would you want to revert back to iPhoto?  If you have a coveted aperture license, why not use it?  On the Retina MBP this program works even better, and looks amazing.  \n\nA: In the latest version of iTunes (10.x or 11.x) you can tell it to sync with either iPhoto or Aperture.\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to iTunes\n\n*Connect your iPad\n\n*Select the \"Photos\" tab\n\n*Select \"Aperture\" next to the \"Sync Photos From\" checkbox.\n\n*Click Apply.\n\n\nA: By the sounds of it, you just backed up your Aperture library and didn't actually migrate all its contents into iPhoto? If so, iTunes won't be able to sync those photos through iPhoto, because it only looks in your iPhoto library.\nIn short, properly import all your photos into iPhoto, and then iTunes will be able to see it. Unless your photos are actually in iPhoto's own library, it'll refuse to sync them, even if iPhoto itself is capable of opening files outside of its library.\n", "Q: Is it safe to use the 12W iPad 4th gen power adapter for earlier iPads and iPhones? The older iPads have 10W power adapter (charger), and the iPhones supposed use only 5W chargers.\nBut the iPad 4th gen, probably due to the larger power consumption, uses a 12W power adapter / charger.\nIs this charger safe to use with the older iPads and iPhones.  Will it overcharge or overheat or damage the battery?  A more serious worry is that if it overheats, then can the battery explode?\n\nA: Yes. The wattage ratings are maximum and all iOS devices will only pull the current they need to charge. \nShould a device or an adapter get too hot to operate safely, they will shut off. \n", "Q: Any way to sort each column differently in the Finder? Is there any way in the Finder to sort each column in column view by different criteria? When I select a sort order, it applies universally to every column.\nFor example, I would like to sort a particular folder by kind, but the contents of a subfolder of that folder by date.\n\nA: There may be a third-party way to do this I haven't heard of, but there is no way to achieve what you want here using native OS X settings.\n\nA: Yup you can do that by using the View Options panel.  Open the folder then from the View menu select the \"Show View Options\".  This brings up the View Options panel.  Here you can set your views for each folder.\nFor example, I have my Downloads folder set to Always open in List View and Sort By Date Added.  This way the most recently downloaded file is always at the top.  No matter what the view was configured in the previous folder, when I open the Downloads folder, it uses these settings.\nI have many other folders set up in specific configurations.  Work images is in a large cover flow layout.  Icon development folder is in Icon View with large icons.  etc...

(I wonder if the iPhone does have this issue, however, when wifi drops the cellular data kicks in and I do not notice the drop). I am left to wonder why this is happening and what I can do about this issue?\nMy router is an Actiontec C1000A (ISP is Century Link). \n\nA: With iOS6, the WiFi will drop when the iPad is put to sleep (via power button or closing the smart cover).  When you wake it up, it should automatically reconnect to the WiFi.  However depending on the WiFi environment (many WiFi networks to choose from, a slow/overloaded WiFi router, etc), this could take a few seconds.\nIf it isn't automatically reconnecting, go into the Settings>WiFi screen and choose your WiFi network.  If it is already checked, click the > on the right and choose to forget that network.

I ask this anticipating the answer is 'no', but - is it possible to forward graphics windows on mac the way you would forward X11 windows, i.e. via ssh?  \nI'm thinking specifically of the python display windows generated by matplotlib, which I'm guessing use cocoa or something similar.\nA workaround for this question is to use Screen Sharing with ssh tunneling, but I'm asking if the direct solution is possible.\n\nA: As you say the answer is no. OSX does not include a remote graphics display whilst X11 does. (The Cocoa API is based on the NeXTStep API which was drawn by Display  Postscript which allowed remote graphics display - however the license cost too much for Apple to use)\nHowever this is a general answer for all applications. But you can configure matplotlib to use an X11 backend and this can be displayed remotely.

My 1 year warranty has just ended within the last week and my daughter dropped my iPad 2 which has resulted in a cracked screen. \nIs there a one-time physical damage replacement policy in Washington state, as there is in others?\n\nA: I can't comment on consumer law but I am familiar with Apple's warranty agreement in the US. \nAppleCare plus would cover physical damage by extending the normal one year manufacturer's warranty both in time to two years and in scope to actually cover physical damage. \nThe normal consumer warranty runs one year from purchase and does not cover accidental damage such as a drop. That being said, you could visit a store (or call AppleCare on the phone) and ask them if it could be covered, but I wouldn't expect coverage due to a drop one week from purchase or one week past one year under the normal manufacturer warranty. Be nice if you ask, they could say yes or they could say no but at least you tried. \nYou also could get a quote to repair and decide what makes the most sense for a repair / sell / replace decision on your part. \n\nA: Also try just taking it into an Apple Store and ask them.  Even if it just out of warranty, if you ask nice enough, they could still cover it.\n", "Q: print option lost after Mountain Lion upgrade After I recently moved my data from a Mac Mini '09 to a new Mac Mini with Mountain Lion, I find my print options no longer allow me to print \"fast\"  (on Canon pixma mx712).

The black plastic casing around the display joint has been broken (has a crack). Is it possible to get a replacement for the same?\n\n\nA: Yes - Apple runs a repair service through AppleCare although the DIY parts are few to none on that model. You can also buy parts from Apple Authorized Service Providers and they are more willing to hand out parts (usually for a price). I'd start with Apple and go from there to AASP and then perhaps third party providers.\nThat piece is nearly all cosmetic and as long as wiring isn't exposed or loose to catch / snag / snap, you might be able to fix it with tape or other adhesive by following the take apart manuals posted at http://www.ifixit.com\n", "Q: Imessage security If someone has my Itunes password and phone number/email address, are they able to set-up their iphone/ipad to see my imessages without my consent?  If so, is there a way for me to trace this?\n\nA: Yes, in a way, it is possible to \"trace\" it. \nThe good news for you, is that (I'm speaking in regards to Mountain Lion and iOS 6, not necessarily for older versions) every time a device authorizes and uses your Apple ID and phone number it will alert you on all your other devices. For example, if you are signed into your Apple ID for Messages on your Mac, and you purchase a new iPad Mini, and sign into it, it will display an alert on your Mac that says (something like) \"[Your] iPad Mini is now using [your Apple ID] for iMessage\". There is no way for you to deny that request (it is just informational) but that would alert you to possible abuse of your account if someone else has maliciously set up your Apple ID on your account. With this information you can easily change your Apple ID password and render the abusive user's information useless. \nI'm not aware of a way to view all of your devices that are using your Apple ID for Messages and Facetime, but if you are careful to be aware of those prompts that come up, and change your password if something suspicious comes up, you will be set. \n", "Q: Can I create a fusion drive with an HDD that already has a boot camp partition? I'm planning to replace the optical drive in my MacBook Pro 9,1 (mid-2012, non-retina) with an SSD and make the two internal drives into a fusion drive, and I know that creating a boot camp partition on a Mac without an optical drive can be a challenge. So I want to create my boot camp partition before I create my fusion drive.\nI couldn't find an answer to this in my googling. I know that you can create a Boot Camp partition if you already have a fusion drive.\nCan I create a fusion drive using an HDD that already has a boot camp partition on it?\n\nA: From my hands-on experience, I'd have to say, \"negative\".\nI've created a couple of fusion drives on a 2008 Mac Pro from devices with preexisting partitions. Building the fusion in Core Storage destroyed all partitions on the media.\n\nA: With trepidation, and after a full backup, I specified two arbitrary slices from two already-partitioned hard drives:\ndiskutil cs create <myTestVolumeName> disk0s2 disk1s4\n\nBecause I picked two partitions I could sacrifice, the HD partition (20GB) was quite small compared to the SSD partition (115GB) which isn't at all the normal use case, but added an extra wrinkle for testing.\nTo my surprise, and supporting what Bbh noted previously, it would seem you can specify slices for not just one, but both parameters. \nI have a working ‘Fusion Drive’ and still have my other ‘stock’ partitions and recovery drives intact. I restored a system to the wee beastie to see if <myTestVolumeName> would boot my MBP5,4 (mid-2009)… It does; this bodes well.\nSo the answer AFAIK is Yes, as to preparing/preserving Boot Camp and exising partitions, at least on my setup. YMMV.\n\nA: I just did this yesterday. \nI was having difficulty with Bootcamp getting stuck at partitioning with my 2011 iMac with a DIY fusion 2TB+256GB. So, I disabled fusion, installed OS X on my HDD, ran Bootcamp and set up a partition for Windows on the HDD, installed Windows 8, booted from OS X thumb drive and then created a fusion drive with just the slices I wanted to use, leaving the recovery and Windows slices alone.\nThe Windows and recovery partitions are not visible at Option-boot until after I installed OS X again on the fusion drive.\n\nA: I think you can. In creating the Logical Volume Group, I read of a fellow who preserved  both his Bootcamp and Recovery partitions by the simple act of specifying the SLICE that contained most of the HDD data. Forexample, \nDiskutil cs create yourdisk d1 d2s2 where d2 is the HDD that contains the major data at d2s2 and Boorcamp at d2s3 and the  recovery partition at d2s4, or some similar setup.  \n", "Q: Find-my-iphone without internet connection Will \"Find My Iphone\" work without wifi connection? \nFor instance, if someone were to steal my iPod they wouldn't be able to connect it without my passcode on the lock screen. And if they can figure out my passcode, what if they don't connect it to the internet? Would the app still work? \n\nA: Nope.  Find My iPhone feature requires internet connectivity to be activated.  If your iDevice is stolen, you can flag it as stolen and set up a remote wipe from icloud.com.  Next time it is connected to a WiFi or to iTunes, it will check icould and be disabled/wiped.\nIf it never connects or they wipe it before connecting, there is no way to track it.\n", "Q: Is it 'ok' to delete zsh's *.asl logs? I do a lot of work in the terminal. Sometimes, after a week or two, start up gets a bit slow (I'm talking about an extra second or two, not the end of the world but it's slower).\nI did some Googling that suggested clearing the logs in /private/var/log/asl/*.asl ought to speed things up, and it did. \nIs it a problem if I added a little command that just cleared those logs when I exited terminal?\n\nA: If you want to control the amount of data that zsh stores in its history files the look at the zsh user guide section 2.5.4 and set HISTSIZE and SAVEHIST\nAs for the .asl logs they are written to be any application, they are the database of Apple's logging mechanism. zsh will not read or even know of these files unless you run command to look at them. Thus I do not see how their size would affect zsh's startup time.\nHowever doing some googling (it helps to show in the question what you have found) It appears that there might be an issue with the login command (which is not zsh but used by the mechanism to start shells). See this thread for some comments - starting from your idea of deleting all .asl files to what seems a more reasonable explanation. login without the -q flag  seems to do an ASL query for last login and that causes a slowdown. The suggestion given there and elsewhere is \n\nThe correct way to bypass the ASL query is to set Terminal to open shells with /bin/bash (or your shell of choice) instead of the default login shell. Terminal will still use /usr/bin/login to launch the shell, but it passes the -q switch to prevent the ASL query.\n\nNote that deleting the .asl files removes all information logged by applications and so doing this removes all chance of seeing what happened on your machine. I think that losing this data is not worth saving a few seconds on startup of terminal, just leave terminal open or try the fix suggested.\n", "Q: Is there a way to backup Evernote to Dropbox? I'd like to be able to use a little bit of the space in my Dropbox account to create a backup of Evernote.  This way if anything happens to Evernote cloud service I'd still have access to the Dropbox backup.  Any ideas?\n\nA: My article at wn7ant.com explains how to do this using the App store version of Evernote:\n\n\n*\n\n*Move ~/Library/Containers/com.evernote.Evernote/Data/Library/Application Support/Evernote to /Users/my_user_on_the_system/Dropbox.\n\n*Create an alias of /Users/my_user_on_the_system/Dropbox/Evernote.\n\n*Move the alias of /Evernote back to ~/Library/Containers/com.evernote.Evernote/Data/Library/Application Support/\n\nA: Using the ifttt.com service you can automate your evernote activity to dropbox.\nHere is a recipe to use: https://ifttt.com/recipes/58926-evernotes\n\nA: One other way to achieve this is to use cloudHQ: http://cloudHQ.net service meant to replicate and synchronize data.\n\n\n*\n\n*So cloudHQ can basically sync and replicate all your Evernote notes with Dropbox, GDrive or some other cloud services (we also support also Basecamp, Salesforce).\n\n*cloudHQ will export all you notes into TXT, ENEX, PDF, OpenOffice, and/or MS Word.\nSince our sync is continuous any change in Evernote will be immediately sync'd to Dropbox (or GDrive, Box, SugarSync, etc.)\n\n*You can do two-sync: so any change from GDrive/Dropbox will be automatically uploaded into Evernote\n\n*Even if you change Evernote via mobile or via web interface changes will be backed up immediately.\n\nA: Rich, the founder of Revert here. We provide free automatic daily backup for Evernote and a growing selection of other apps including Dropbox. Using Revert for backup takes the fuss out of the backup process and makes restoring notes or notebooks fast and easy. \nWe were reviewed recently on The Next Web.\nGive it a try and if you have any questions feel free to ask a follow on question here.\n\nA: There is a product called Revert.io , it creates a backup for evernote, dropbox and some other cloud product and allows you to not only search across all of them but also restore.

Unfortunately, in my experience, tesseract is really below that threshold. I define \"moderately acceptable\" an OCR that can, say, OCR an utility bill so that at least the account number (customer number) is recognized correctly.\nEDIT: \"scriptable\" or \"automatable\", that is, able to be triggered automatically and run unattended without human input whatsoever.\n\nA: Disclaimer: NOT AN OCR SOLUTION (but this answer is still useful to extract text from pdf)\nThere is an Apache Software Foundation project called Apache Tika:\n\nA toolkit detects and extracts metadata and structured text content\n  from various documents using existing parser libraries\n\nThey support PDF text extraction using PDFBox:\n\nallows creation of new PDF documents, manipulation of existing documents and\n  the ability to extract content from documents. Apache PDFBox also includes\n  several command line utilities\n\nAnd they recently also added support for OCR (via Tesserac)\nFor a text based solution, PDFBox makes very simple to extract text from a PDF:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the pdfbox-app package from https://pdfbox.apache.org/downloads.html\n\n*run the ExtractText command on it:\njava -jar pdfbox-app-x.y.z.jar ExtractText myNiceBook.pdf myNiceBook.txt\nIt also has some other nice options that you can see in ExtractText docs.\n\nA: It's not entirely clear to me what your requirements are for being able to \"script\" this from the \"command line\".\nIf you are talking about automation, then that is possible with any number of utilities.\nABBYY FineReader Express + Keyboard Maestro + Hazel\nI use ABBYY FineReader Express + Keyboard Maestro + Hazel like so:\n\n\n*\n\n*Hazel monitors a given folder for any new PDFs\n\n*if a PDF is found, it is opened in \"ABBYY FineReader Express\"\n\n*Keyboard Maestro then automates the process of turning the PDF into a Searchable PDF (OCR) and saves the file to a different directory.\nNow, if you don't own Hazel and Keyboard Maestro already, your initial costs are going to rise pretty quickly (although I depend on both so much I consider them a bargain).\nPDFPen + AppleScript + Folder Actions\nYou could do something similar with PDFPen (or PDFPenPro) and folder actions and AppleScript.

You want to add OCR layer to different kinds of material such as random photos, screenshots, PDFs without OCR layer and so on? I don't know the solution but I am sure someone knows so asked a specific question how to do it with Automator and some OCR software:\nAutomator-script with an OCR-software to automatically add OCR to material?\n\nA: For this type of self-directed application, I'm a big fan of Hazel.\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.noodlesoft.com/hazel.php\nIt makes it extremely easy to script actions without needing to learn a more command line oriented tool like perl or python and paired with the OCR engine of your choice (mine is currently PDF Pen Pro) you should have no problems getting your files processed with minimal fuss.\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.smilesoftware.com/PDFpenPro/index.html\nBoth of these are paid software, but the utility of both far extends past this one case. In my situation, with the labor involved in digitizing my past scanned records (and ongoing paper), the price of these far outweighs the time I would have spend programming this elsewhere and now that I own both tools, I can do many other tasks with them.\n\nA: I got high quality Drag & Drop conversion working using Docker.\nIf you:\n\n*\n\n*install Docker for your Mac and\n\n*then create a new Automator app\n\n*with these contents inside a \"Run a Shell Script\" action. Choose Pass Input: \"as arguments\"\n/bin/bash script text:\ncd \"`dirname \"$1\"`\"\n/usr/local/bin/docker run --rm -v \"$(pwd):/home/docker\" jbarlow83/OCRmyPDF --force-ocr \"`basename \"$1\"`\" \"`basename -s .pdf \"$1\"`-ocr.pdf\"\n\nYou should then be good to drag-and-drop PDFs onto it and and you'll get a similarly named PDF with \"-ocr\" appended to the file name.\nI imagine it could be easily modified to return a file to Automator to copy somewhere as well. More details about the fine OCRmyPDF docker package. and main tool (also mentioned in a different answer).\nYou can test it in Automator itself with \"Get specified Finder items\" action as input to this.\nThe first time it runs, it make take more time as it will need to download the Docker images for OCRmyPDF (invisibly). In Terminal, you can alternatively run docker pull jbarlow83/ocrmypdf to speed up the first run.\nA typical run takes about 10 seconds per high DPI page but has automatically text-to-speachable results even if there are tables or diagrams. Before OCRing, I crop using Sejda so nonsense margin words from other pages are removed.\nThe --force-ocr argument tells the tool to ignore and overwrite any earlier OCR attempts, which in my cases are usually only partial and useless.\nEdit 2022: This alternative script enables multiple files to be dragged onto the app to be queued and OCRed:\nfor f in \"$@\"\ndo\ncd \"`dirname \"$f\"`\"\n/usr/local/bin/docker run --rm -v \"$(pwd):/app\" jbarlow83/ocrmypdf --force-ocr \"`basename \"$f\"`\" \"`basename -s .pdf \"$f\"`-ocr.pdf\"\ndone\n\n\nA: PDFScannerApp does have an unofficial scripting support. Contact the author for the Automator action.\n\nA: I use Adobe acrobat to OCR in batch. My duplex scanner can OCR after scanning but the OCR technology in acrobat is more accurate in my opinion. I just point to there folder that has no OCR then acrobat re saves the PDF as a searchable PDF now including a text layer. If I wanted to OCR via command line, I don't know of a way but I can automate the GUI end by using Autohotkey. Not as reliable nor fast as command line, but it does the job after you set up a workflow action to minimize the GUI interaction.\nFor Mac, apple script does what Autohotkey does on the PC although I haven't tried on my Mac yet.\nAuto hot key comes with a recorder so most of the script writing is dinner for you with a littler bit of editing for refinement and perhaps looping if you want that.\nI've been experimenting OCRing images but haven't automated the process fully yet through acrobat. Command line is ideal but haven't found a quality OCR engine that exceeds acrobat so I stick with acrobat for now.\n\nA: I stumbled upon this recently:  http://ocrkit.com/faq.html\nYou have to pay after 14 days though\n\nA: OCRKit has both AppleScript support and a CLI.

It seems that making edits, annotations, or even just opening and saving a PDF file in Preview will cause a significant increase in file size. I've noticed that for some books I've scanned this also happens to improve page rendering time.\nCan anyone shed some light as to what is going on to cause these changes? I am interested in synching annotations of PDF ebooks between Preview and the iPad (maybe GoodReader) but this may be too impractical with large PDF files.\n\nA: I know this is quite late, but I have found something that seems to work, at least if used initially: I've tried using the Quartz filter to \"Reduce File Size.\" It seems to work but is not on by default. I can specifically choose it via the Save As menu (hold Option), but am worried that it defaults to the usual method on the autosaves.\nHere is what is happening for me and how I got to this page in the first place:\nThe PDF starts out as a 91MB 900 page book.

Why can't it just save the annotations/highlights but not try to recompress all the pictures like I'm resaving a JPEG each time. Thanks for the help!\n\nA: In his little-known novel, PDF Karenina, Leo Tolstoy wrote,\n\nOptimally encoded PDF files are all alike; every sub-optimally encoded PDF file  is sub-optimally encoded in its own way. \n\nIt's hard for anyone to answer why your PDF files are larger after Preview modifies them. A PDF file consists of many different kinds of data: images, content streams, fonts, document overhead, color spaces, extended graphics states, and a cross reference table. Just like one sentence might be concise and another verbose, but both are valid English and say the same thing, so too one PDF file might have a more verbose way of representing the same content as a more concise PDF file. We'd have to look at your exact PDF files. It's likely that they were created by a variety of different pieces of software, some consise, some less so. \nIt also matters what version of Mac OS X and Preview you are using, because that determine the software that writes the new PDF file when you do a Save As in Preview. \nI can, however, tell you what gets larger about some of my PDF files. This story applies to my computer, running Mac OS X 10.5.8 and Apple Preview 4.2 (469.5).\nOne file, Giulio.pdf, is a 22-page document with text as text, not scanned images. It is 461,092 bytes large. I opened it in Preview, did File... Save As..., and saved it under a new file name. The new file is 724,421 bytes, or 57% larger. \nI opened each file with Adobe Acrobat Professional, version 8.3.1 for Mac OS. I did Advanced... PDF Optimizer... Audit Space Usage.... A small dialog box gave a break-down of how many bytes were due to each category of usage, plus the percent of the total file size for the category. \nThe original Giulio.pdf has 390,754 bytes (84.75%) devoted to content streams, and zero bytes devoted to images. It is in the PDF 1.4 format. The file saved by Preview has 675,846 bytes (93.29%) devoted to content streams, also zero bytes of images, and is in the PDF 1.3 format.  Preview made the content streams 285,092 bytes larger, and that represents 73% of the file size difference between the two.\nI wondered if the PDF 1.3 file format was inherently less efficient for storing this kind of file. I opened the original Giulio.pdf in Adobe Acrobat Professional 8, and did Advanced... PDF Optimizer... Make compatible with: Acrobat 3.0 and later and pressed OK. I saved the resulting file under a new name. The resulting file is in the PDF 1.3 format, and was 452,356 bytes, or smaller than the original. Its content streams are 375,171 bytes (82.94%), a similar proportion, but smaller than the content streams of original file.\nThus it seems we can conclude that the Preview app on Mac OS X 10.5.8 is not as efficient as some other PDF creators at making concise content streams in PDF files, and the difference is enough to account for three-quarters of the size difference in a PDF file without images.\nI did a similar experiment on form k.pdf, a 1-page document scanned from paper. The original file is 303,730 bytes, of which 298,197 bytes (98.18%) are images. A copy of this file created by Preview using Save As... is 300,601 bytes, or 1% smaller. This file size difference is more than accounted for by a smaller \"document overhead\" category of bytes in the file created by Preview.\nThus it seems we also can conclude that Preview doesn't always cause a PDF file to increase in size. It depends on the nature of the original PDF file, and how concise it was to start with.\n\nA: The problem remains a serious one. In Preview 7.0 (Mac Os 10.9.5.) I generated a pdf using Acrobat 9.5.5. that resulted in a 5 MB file. In Preview I added exactly 12 characters (using the edit tools). After saving this file it balooned to 14 MB.\nYou can fix it by opening and saving again in Acrobat (may have to use the \"reduce file size\" option).\n\nA: Can't add clues to the solution. I can add a similar scenario (OS X 10.11.3): a scanned pdf weighing in at ~800kb is opened in preview, a couple of empty scanned paged are deleted, the resulting, two-page shorter pdf is ~2,2Mb. \"Option-Save as\" and selecting the \"reduce file size\" quartz filter compresses the file down to... 1,9Mb.\nThe original file has been generated by a Xerox WC 7830 copier, which in my experience (compared to previous multi-function printer/copier machines we had) produces quite well-optimized scanned pdf's.\nCannot see any difference in the file, visually; I'd guess the page images are being recompressed in 24bpp, whereas the original file is cleary using much less colour-depth, likely 6-bit (it's a printed and signed document, text only, the scanner makes a good job of keeping the white background pure white). Sadly, Preview is not clever enough to detect and maintain this, and seems to need to recompress the whole file although no changes are made in the remaining pages (again, only a couple of pages have been deleted.\n", "Q: What location data will an Android phone provide to an iOS device that lacks GPS? Will my iPad 4 Wi-Fi only (or an iPod touch) get live location data for navigation purposes if I connect to an Android mobile phone that is enabled as a Wi-Fi hotspot?\n\nA: When you tether an iOS device, it will have a live data connection and perhaps make some better use of any Wi-Fi signals that are in range for determining location, but in general - you won't get GPS like accuracy just because an iPad or iPod is connected to a phone (android or iOS) over Wi-Fi tethering.\nJust like your computer can't really gain GPS data from a Wi-Fi router, the same holds for an andriod based Wi-Fi router that happens to be a phone.\nThere is no reason why this data couldn't be sent to an app and a GPS server could be conceived on Android or iOS to provide streaming data, but this isn't something that comes automatically or by-design from Wi-Fi tethering.\n", "Q: Editing info.plist of .ipa files renders app unable to run I'm trying to edit some values of an info.plist file that is located in an .ipa file.

I'm not looking for redundancy (which I know I can now get with multiple Time Machine disks in 10.8); I'm just trying to spread the single backups across multiple disks.  Any advice out there?\n\nA: Yes - assuming you have OS X server running on the Mac Pro, you could share each drive under a different name and enable both for Time Machine backups.\nYou could then configure some portion of the machines to hit share A and the rest to hit share B. Since each computer stores backup contents in a sparse disk bundle, you could even shift a backup or two to the other drive and then reconfigure things if your initial allocation wasn't working after some time passes.\n", "Q: Mac applications refuse to launch Every time I click on a application, both Apple and third party applications refuse to open.

Any ideas? \n\nA: You can fire up the /Applications/Utilities/Console.app and look over the logs as you are launching programs.\nIf the messages are not clear, you could either edit some details in the question or post a new question for each app / message that has you stumped as to a cause or solution.\nOf course, you also might try some generic troubleshooting steps like rebooting, checking the apps with a new user, etc...\n", "Q: How can I make in-app purchases with a different Apple ID than the app was purchased with? I have three children with three iPods and recently gave them all their own Apple ID accounts so that their iTunes money would be separate. However, now they cannot buy apps to add on to their games because the games were bought on our original Apple account.\nHow can I get the purchase to go through?\n\nA: Purchasing from one account and then using another for in-app purchase (IAP) isn't currently possible. \nSince each application is digitally signed when you download it from the App Store - you are tied to using the same account for in-app purchases as for the initial purchase.\nIf it is a free app, you could back up the device to iCloud, delete the app, re-purchase the app under the correct account and then restore the device from the backup. If you are not worried about saving game state, you can skip the backup and the restore steps.\nIf the app is not free, then you are faced with deciding to buy the in-app purchase from the original account or re-buying the app on the correct account.\n\nA: You can log in and out of iTunes app store with different Apple IDs on the same device. I do it all the time with grandkids.\nAdminister account, hide purchases, browse store, all of it. In-app purchases should be no different. Just take care to log kids out of app store, and password your device!\n", "Q: IMAP setting for hotmail in Outlook v14 for mac os x I got for a few years a hotmail account and get my mail into outlook with POP setting.... everything is fine...

I'm trying to set up my Macbook Air to share an OpenVPN connection for use while I'm on the road and don't want my iOS traffic to go over the open Internet. Sadly, Mountain Lion's Internet Sharing feature doesn't include the VPN interface in the list of shareable network interfaces, so I assume I'm going to have to emulate Internet Sharing from the command line.\nI've figured out some of the moving pieces that are put in place by the InternetSharing wrapper:\n\n\n*\n\n*ifconfig to set up the bridge interface\n\n*ipfw to set up forwarding of traffic\n\n*bootpd to offer DHCP service to clients\n\n*natpmpd to handle port forwarding\n\n*named in a cache configuration to handle DNS queries\n\n\nOne piece I haven't figured out is the configuration of the wireless network, namely the SSID and WPA2 configuration.

I have installed an application (dsniff) using brew, but when I try to run it I get a \"Command not found\" error.  I even tried going to the directory it was installed to:\n/usr/local/Cellar/dsniff/2.4b1/sbin/\nconfirming that it was there (it is) and running it, but I get the same error.  Any idea why this would happen?\n\nA: Dsniff links its programs in to /usr/local/sbin instead of /usr/local/bin. The sbin/ directory is for more sysadmin-oriented stuff and isn't on the path for non-root accounts. Most other Homebrew formulae don't link there.\nDsniff will even warn you about this during the installation.\n$ brew install dsniff\n==> Downloading http://monkey.org/~dugsong/dsniff/beta/dsniff-2.4b1.tar.gz\n#\n[ ... ]\n==> make install\nWarning: /usr/local/sbin is not in your PATH\nYou can amend this by altering your ~/.bashrc file\n==> Summary\n/usr/local/Cellar/dsniff/2.4b1: 35 files, 420K, built in 11 seconds\n\nSo, add /usr/local/sbin to your path in the same place that you add /usr/local/bin, probably in ~/.bashrc, and you'll pick up dsniff.\nIn general, when you run in to things like this, and you're not sure where the files went, you can use find to search for them. For Homebrew, they'll always be somewhere under /usr/local, if they're anywhere.\n$ find /usr/local -name dsniff\n/usr/local/Cellar/dsniff\n/usr/local/Cellar/dsniff/2.4b1/sbin/dsniff\n/usr/local/Library/LinkedKegs/dsniff\n/usr/local/opt/dsniff\n/usr/local/sbin/dsniff\n\n\nA: You can try manually linking the executable dsniff.\nln -s /usr/local/Cellar/dsniff/2.4b1/dsniff /usr/local/bin/dsniff\n\nThis creates a link back to the original file in Cellar, but your shell will be able to find it in its path, because /usr/local/bin is usually in it.\nAfter doing so, you can call dsniff from anywhere.\n\nA: If anyone else is having issues and their $PATH variable is already fine, I'd suggest:\nbrew unlink dsniff\nbrew link dsniff\n\nThis worked for me when I had a similar issue.\n\nA: Check /usr/local/bin and is it in your $PATH? Make sure /usr/local/bin is before /usr/bin.\nFor a quick (non-permanent) check, execute export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH in the current shell and retry to run the command.\n\nA: As kukoo mentioned, it sounds like you don't have /usr/local/bin in your path. To make it so you can easily run applications that you've installed from brew, run this command:\necho \"export PATH=/usr/local/bin:\\$PATH\" >> $HOME/.bashrc\n\nThat should set you straight. \nAs for why it didn't run after being in the same directory, it's probably because of the way you were referencing it. Did you preface the binary name with ./?\n", "Q: iOS 6 activation error on iPhone 3GS without SIM card I recently got an iPhone 3GS without a SIM card. I upgraded it to iOS 6 from 5.1.1. \nHowever, the phone is stuck on \"Activation error\" after successfully connecting to my WiFi. The screen says:\n\nActivation request could not be completed. If the problem persists,\n  please contact customer care.\n\nIf connected to iTunes 11, iTunes says:\n\nWe're sorry, we are unable to continue with your activation at this\n  time.\n\nResetting the phone doesn't work. Anybody has any ideas, besides contacting customer care?\nEdit: The problem was solved by inserting a valid SIM card.\n\nA: I had a similar error once, and if I remember correctly, it was that the time on the iPhone was wrong (months or years, I think). Setting the time correctly allowed it to go through. \n\nA: The message you describe is what happens when a locked phone is restored by iTunes without a SIM present from the carrier that the phone should be locked.\nYou could use any of the IME I look up tools on the Internet- some are free and some are paid and all make me worry they are harvesting databases of  IMEI/serial number/other data in exchange for providing you a service by looking up your phone in the carrier database. \nOf course, you can always contact the carrier in question to see what is needed to get service or a Sim card for that device.\n", "Q: Can Ipad 4 bought in USA work with other mobile operators in Europe? I need information and explanations how Ipad 4 with mobile card can work in Europe\n(Alcatel,, Wodafone or others)? Can somebody help me and explain what and how I can change its settings in order to work with the local providers?\n\nA: In general, yes. Apple has a very easy to read page listing all the LTE channels each iPad supports.\nhttp://www.apple.com/ipad/LTE/\nSince no iPad is locked to a carrier, you don't have to jailbreak or unlock them - just pop in the Sim card for whatever carrier you like and you'll be pretty much ready to go. You should also check the non-LTE radio frequencies for each model by looking over the technical specifications page.\nhttp://www.apple.com/ipad/specs/\nIn the US, the Verizon & Sprint models also speak CDMA as well as operate on all the typical GSM data frequencies - so you might prefer a pure GSM model or one that can work on CDMA if needed, but this won't make much difference for many that want to use an iPad in Europe. \n", "Q: Delete all calendars and contacts in iOS I'd like to delete all calendars and contacts on an iPod Touch with iOS 5.0.1 without affecting calendars and contacts in OS X.\nI've read guides that instruct to disable calendars for accounts in order to delete calendars.

A terrible loss since it took me many evenings categorising all this data.\nWith a deep-scan with DataRescue 3, I was able to recover most of it, but they all have the same awful filename \"M00001.avi\", \"M00002.avi\",...\n\nFirst question, is there any way to improve this results? Meaning to retrieve the file including the proper naming?  \n\nA: Data rescue is fairly sophisticated program on the Mac. If there were any traces the filename in the filesystem, that software puts the file name back when it performs a simple undelete. What you are seeing are video fragments of files that were found on the filesystem totally detached from a directory entry.\nIn short you're not going to be able to get the file names back without a backup or other source of the file names. \nHopefully, those AVI files are actually complete files and not just fragments of video content that it managed patch together with a proper header and a sequentially made-up filename. \n", "Q: Photos imported from iPhone lose their albums I've got a load of albums that I made on my iPhone to organize my photos. But when they get imported into iPhoto (which I do over Photo Stream), they lose their albums and come in just as one long stream. \nThis also seems to happen if I just bring them in using iPhoto and the USB lead.\nIs there any way to bring them in and preserve the albums, or do I have to rebuild each album again inside of iPhoto?\n\nA: I don't have an answer, but I think I can clarify the question:\nIn the built-in IOS Photo app, you can create Albums, which are essentially folders of aliases. So I created the album Selva Verde fauna, for photos of animals I'd taken in the Costa Rican lowlands. In iPhoto, this album seems to be inaccessible: all I see is my iPhone device name (say, David's iPhone) and the photos in my Camera Roll. So all the time I spent selecting photos is wasted, and I have to guess which are the edited versions I've tweaked in Filterstorm (a truly fantastic app: 70% of Photoshop's capabilities for 2% of the price!). To make things even more irritating, in the iPhone Photos app the images are in chronological order, so edited versions always come after originals. iPhoto, however, puts them right next to the original image. \nWhat I'd like, and I think it's what Sam's asking for, is a way to import albums from the iPhone, instead of just individual images. \n\nA: The only way I've worked out how to do it is to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the Dropbox app on your mobile device.  \n\n*Manually add folders with the same names as the ones on your iPhone photos app.\n\n*Select the first folder you want to copy to in Dropbox then select the three dots in the top right corner, click 'add files' which will open you iPhone Photos app.  Select the folder containing the photos you want to copy, select the photos then select 'upload'.  Repeat for all folders you want to copy.\n\n*Open the Dropbox app on your computer and you can manually copy over the folders.\n\n\nA: Here, I found this app and I think this might be the app you need :\nhttp://www.photosync-app.com/photosync/en/features.html\nMaybe this article can help you out? \nhttp://lifehacker.com/5914638/the-best-desktop-file-explorer-for-iphone\nBut you have to do it manually then. \nSome of the listed apps in the article : \n\n\n*\n\n*i-FunBox\n\n*iExplorer\n\n*DiskAid\n\n*Phonedisk\n\n\nA: Very disappointingly, there is no way to natively import Albums created on your iPhone to anywhere. It is a limitation because of the way the \"Albums\" are created on the iPhone. They are virtual folders that point to photos on your Camera Roll. You can only import (export really) photos from your Camera Roll.\nI am exploring some third party apps with hopes they might solve this frustrating dilemma.      \n\nA: If the albums were brought from the computer (i.e. synced with iTunes), then the photos will not lose their album association on the computer. However, if you created the albums on your iPad, then you are out of luck. The albums created in the Photos app are for local photo organization on the iPad only. \nI've heard that Google's Picassa could help you transfer the iPad albums to computer. \n\nA: I found a solution that I want to share with this community. CopyTrans Photo, which sells for $20, recognizes which photos belong to which albums and allows me to copy just those photos to my PC. It also does a full backup if I want to do that. \nAs others have already stated, \"albums\" in iPhones are just entries in a database that points image files to an \"album\". There isn't actually a separate folder; all image files still reside in the \"DCIM\" folder. \nCopyTrans Photo is able to the database, figure out which image file is associated with an album, and present only those files for copying. \n\nA: I managed to easily download only a single iPhone photo album onto my mac. \nOpen the album on the iPhone, choose \"Select\", then \"Select All\".  Choose the box with the up arrow (export), then choose \"AirDrop\".  If your Mac is plugged in via USB or on the same Wifi it should show up.  Choose the computer, and a notification should pop-up on your computer.\nYou may need a recent OS X (I think Yosemite should be fine), and a newer iOS.\n", "Q: Is a hardware-based full disk encryption possible on a Mac? Is it possible to use hardware-based full disk encryption (perhaps on a Samsung 840 Pro SSD) on a Mac, specifically a Macbook Pro 8,2? If so, how?\nMy understanding is that this will be handled in the BIOS or possibly EFI, however I think Apple's EFI is generally quite locked down.\nI'm not looking for any software-based solutions such as FileVault 2 or TrueCrypt. I dual boot and matters will be simpler if it is handled in hardware.\n\nA: I've asked myself exactly the same thing as I've also bough a Samsung 840 Pro for my MacBook Pro. After some research I've found this post indicating that the 840 Pro's hardware encryption requires TPM support, and that's only found in PC BIOSes, not in Mac's (U)EFI. To be sure, I've asked Samsung support which of the standards \"ATA-Security\", \"Seagate DriveTrust\" and \"TCG OPAL\" are supported by the 840 Pro, and their answer was:\n\nDear Customer,\nThank you for contacting Samsung SSD support regarding your inquiry.\n  In response to your inquiry, the only one of the 3 that the unit\n  supports is the ATA Security feaure. As for the encryption, the 840\n  Pro Series SSD only supports AES 256 bit hardware level encryption but\n  requires the BIOS to be TPM enabled.\n\nSo there's no way to enable the 840 Pro's hardware encryption in a Mac.\nHowever, there's also the Crucial M500 which supports TCG's Opal. In conjunction with a special Opal management software like WinMagic's SecureDoc for Mac it sounds as if it's possible to get hardware encryption to work on a Mac. \nBTW, note that according to Sophos' support their SafeGuard does support Opal only on Windows, not on Mac OS. Also, McAfee's General Q&A for Opal states\n\nQ: Will Opal drives be supported on Mac OS X?\nA: No. Apple currently does not ship their devices with Opal drives so Opal is not supported on Endpoint Encryption for Mac.\n\nBut of course that's says nothing about that happens if you just put an Opal drive into a Mac yourself.\n\nA: Expanding on sschuberth's answer, as of December 2013, the Samsung 840 EVO (but not PRO) also has firmware that directly supports TCG OPAL.  It's a good bet that an 840 Pro firmware update to do the same thing will come soon.\nYou need some software to manage the SED drive, otherwise you get little or no benefit from the built-in security.\nWinMagic SecureDoc will manage the drive, but not for every OS X release out there (anecdotal evidence suggests 10.8.1: ok, 10.8.2: not ok).  \nYou'll need to run WinMagic enterprise software, too, I believe.  While they have a standalone edition of SecureDoc to support SEDs, it appears that it is only available for Windows.\nNOTE:  SecureDoc does not require a TPM for SEDs, nor does the 840 EVO running in TCG Opal mode.  SecureDoc can support the use of a TPM if you have one and enable the feature (Windows only).\n\nA: This is a good question and - yes - finding an answer to it is almost impossible. Samsung sends to Apple support. I would expect to hear from Apple that it's not possible.\nFull disk encryption HW vs FileVault - difference in performance is noticeable. If you are not business user on strict encryption requirements, then we need to look for HW based Samsung solution. But how to enable it on Mac - pain to find out.\n\nA: Yes, Viasat's Eclypt product range works with Mac (EFI) and provides full disk, FIPS approved, hardware encryption.\nSee: Eclypt Core Self-Encrypting Internal Hard Drive\nThe datasheets for the Eclypt product range are not yet up to date (but Mac OS X 10.5+ is supported as is Apple UEFI). You can see the specific product at http://www.amazon.co.uk/Eclypt-Core-200-Internal-Encrypted/dp/B00GJV2OE4.

Sometimes I have to re-enter my password only once and all the apps work (until the next reboot), but often I have to repeat this for every single App Store app I open.\nFor example, I might get this dialog the first time I launch Reeder after rebooting OS X:\n\n\nSign in to use this application on this computer\n“Reeder.app” was purchased using App Store on another computer. To install “Reeder.app” on this computer, sign in using the Apple ID and password used to purchase it.\n\nI have tried to delete the following files:\n\n\n*\n\n*~/Library/Caches/com.apple.appstore\n\n*~/Library/Caches/com.apple.storeagent\n\n*~/Library/Cookies/com.apple.appstore.plist\n\n*~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.appstore.plist\n\n*~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.storeagent.plist\nBut this didn't solve the problem. I have reinstalled all the apps, but that didn't help either. Moreover, I have done a clean install of OS X (for another reason) but I still have this issue with Mac App Store apps. Could this be related to my hardware or Apple ID?\nIs there anyone who has had a similar problem or someone who might help me?\n\nA: This same problem plagued me for months.  Any non-free mac store app would ask for a user name and password to access with the dialog box shown above.  When I lacked internet access, the app simply wouldn't load at all.  \nAfter trying all sorts of solutions - deleting the apps and reinstalling, re-entering passwords and credit  card numbers in the app store itself, etc., I finally found something that solved the problem:\nI reinstalled Mountain Lion from the rescue partition installed on my hard drive.  While this takes some time (about three hours), it isn't as drastic as it sounds.  All my apps and files and passwords were intact after the reinstallation, and for the past two weeks I haven't had to re-enter any mac app store passwords for the apps I've purchased.\nhere's a link to a Macworld article that explains the process of reinstalling the OS:\nhttp://www.macworld.com/article/1167870/hands_on_with_mountain_lions_os_x_recovery_and_internet_recovery.html\n", "Q: What to do if I sold my MacBook Air and didn't disable iCloud I recently sold my MacBook Air, and I deauthorized iTunes, wiped the hard drive, and reinstalled snow leopard (the os version that came installed with the MBA). \nI stumbled upon this shortly after, which made me very nervous since I didn't do it. \nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/HT5189\nThis is what I didn't do:\n\nTurn off Find My Mac and sign out of iCloud\nTo turn off the iCloud service on your Mac:\nChoose System Preferences > iCloud. Deselect Find My Mac to disconnect\n  your devices from iCloud. Click the Sign Out button on the left side.\n  The system automatically removes iCloud data from all of your devices.\n\nHow nervous about this should I be? Also, is there anything I can do now that the computer is not in my possession?\n\nA: Not at all - when you wiped the drive, the iCloud registration token for that device was wiped as well.\nThe only remnants of your account on that Mac might be your FindMyMac token that gets stored on the Recovery HD.\nYou might contact the seller and lest them choose whether you will send a remote wipe at their convenience to clear that. If they enable Find My Mac - they will see your email and be able to remove your hold on tracking at device. \nIf you can't or don't want to contact the buyer, you could also just forget that device using the web interface to iCloud or the Find My Phone app on iOS. \nAgain, the person can't get at your information or log in as you - just that computer might still check in depending on how exactly you wiped the storage drive. \n\nA: This is not entirely true. If you do not remove your iCloud account from your old device, it will remain with that device. Our company sold our fleet of Mac Air's and a few had iCloud set up. These machines were all wiped and re-imaged, then sold. The new users never set up iCloud so that account is blank. HOWEVER, we still had access to those sold machines via iCloud! We could wipe and/or lock at-will, even after removing that device from your iCloud account. Annoying and potentially dangerous. You have to have the new user create a new iCloud account and request approval from the old user to proceed. Ridiculous! We ran around in circles with this problem when a few of our employees noticed they could track their old Mac's after sold. Oops. Now we know disassociating before sale is imperative.\n\nA: Go to iCloud.com and a list of devices associated with you account will appear. If iCloud is still active on your previous device, you can locate, erase, or disassociate your account with the selected device after signing in. Easy peasy.

I had originally upgraded from 10.6 -- though the utilities had seemed to work fine for a while after the initial upgrade, my suspicion is that I did something to some unknown-to-me configuration while attempting to diagnose/resolve the other issue (something that apparently disabled some aspects of DNS access).\nAfter the re-install, all DNS-related utilities are now working fine.\n\nA: nslookup does not use the system DNS settings to my knowledge, but rather queries the servers from resolv.conf directly.\nping, on the other hand, uses the system resolver to resolve names, and so the query might go to other DNS servers. For example, you can configure per-domain name servers in /etc/resolver, but these will not be used by nslookup.

This may not fix your problem, but it is a very quick and non-damaging step that you can take while you are trying to cover all the bases.\n\nA: I resolved this by using a different set of DNS servers.\nI was getting \";; connection timed out; no servers could be reached\" with dig, host, and nslookup.

I am trying to read the iPad Mini US warranty, but I can't make heads or tails out of it.\nDoes it cover accidental damage?\nHere is what happened.  I got my kid an iPad Mini 2 weeks ago.  At his mom's place, he placed it on the table, his mom was cleaning and put it on a fold out bed where his grandma stays when she comes there.  \nThe grandma, who can't see very well, then folded the bed and bent the iPad mini.  It's still kind of functional (in that it beeped, when we tried to locate it via Find My Phone app), but there is a bent and the screen is cracked.\nI seriously want to scream, still, 2 days later, but...on an off chance, does the warranty cover accidental damage?\n\nA: No - damage caused by external forces is excluded from all Apple Warranties.\nIt lists some other hazards that don't get covered as a manufacturing defect like fire, liquid, earthquake, etc.\nAppleCare plus does however cover accidental damage of all sorts as long as you have the device to hand in. (It doesn't cover loss).\nMany people have some coverage from a credit card or other insurance - so you might check that and depending on whether you are pre / post purchase (or within the time widow when you can buy AppleCare for that iPad) to see what your best options are for coverage.\nIn your case - you might get it to Apple as soon as possible - just because the wording is to deny coverage - sometimes there are times when an exception could be made or some compromise reached - especially when the device is very, very new and you were unaware of the AppleCare plus when this was gifted / purchased.\n", "Q: Does upgrading my iCloud plan extend my previous subscription? If I upgrade my iCloud storage subscription, do I basically lose my previous upgrade?\nAs of today, Apple's iCloud storage upgrade options look like this:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*10 additional GB (15 GB total): $20/year\n  \n*20 additional GB (25 GB total): $40/year\n  \n*50 additional GB (55 GB total): $100/year\n  \n\nIf I purchase the 10 additional GB plan today, I pay $20. Let's say that six months from now I decide I need more storage and so upgrade to the 20 additional GB plan. \nDo I pay $40 at that point (as opposed to an additional $20 upgrade of the first plan, or some kind of prorated thing)? \nAssuming that I do have to pay the full $40, do I drop down to the free level a year after that, or do I drop down to the 10 GB level for six months and then down to the free level?\nI've not had much luck Googling this or searching through Apple's support pages, so I'm hoping someone here has experience or (better) can point me to something definite.\n\nA: The terms are listed deep in this link to the iCloud terms and conditions:\n\nThe applicable storage fee for an upgraded storage plan will take\n  effect immediately; downgrades to your storage plan will take effect\n  on the next annual billing date.\n\nSo a literal interpretation would be you would not get any credit for the unused portion of the year you paid for the initial storage if you upsold yourself before that year term expired.\nIn practice, Apple has been generous with giving pro-rated refunds for AppleCare when you cancel it (but that is listed explicitly in the T&C for AppleCare) and has extended MobileMe storage for free - so you could either get the lower storage tier added to the end of the higher tier (which would be a bit of a complicated thing for Apple to track - especially if you did two buys in one year).\nI suppose you could open a ticket with billing support to see if they have a current policy on how they handle up-sales from one paid tier to another, but I would expect the initial purchase to end when you upgrade to a higher tier before the anniversary unless you contact Apple and they offer you a credit or extension as an exception and not something that is programmed into the system.\n\nA: Here's what the Apple iCloud Help site says - hope it helps\n\nAdditional Information\nIf you purchase a higher-tier storage plan for your iCloud account to\n  replace your existing storage plan (for example, a 20 GB plan to\n  replace a 10 GB plan), the existing plan will be canceled and you will\n  receive a prorated refund for the time remaining. The new storage plan\n  is applied to your iCloud account and the annual payment date is\n  updated to reflect the purchase date for the new plan.\nNote: You can't use Apple Store gift cards as a form of payment to\n  upgrade your iCloud storage (payment methods accepted include iTunes\n  store credit, credit cards, and debit cards).

My sisters and I all have iPhones under the same account. I also have an iPad under the same account. I am trying to get the iMessage on my iPad compatible with my phone number, not email address. \nThe only phone number choice to choose from is my sister's iPhone number. How can I choose my phone number for iMessage on my iPad?\n\nA: The only way to get a phone number associated with iMessage is for that phone number to be provisioned to an iPhone and have SMS messages active from the carrier. At that point, you can sign in to iMessage with your Apple ID / iCloud account and it will verify the phone number is actually connected to that device and your AppleID will then inherit that phone number.\nAt that point, you can remove that phone number from that iPhone and use another Apple ID with iMessage. With dual sim / esim you might even get both numbers active on one iOS device. \nSo, unless you can borrow an iPhone long enough to get your carrier to provide 5 minutes of service to an iPhone - long enough to register, you will be stuck with an email address for iMessage.\nBy this process, you could have more than one phone number associated with one Apple ID. You cannot however get one phone number associated with more than one Apple ID as the last ID to get registered with iMessage removes that number from any other Apple ID that used to \"claim\" that number as deliverable.\n\nA: It appears the crucial point is you have two iPhones, so both SIMs registered to your iCloud/iMessage at the same time. \nIf you only have one iPhone and two SIM cards, taking the first SIM out and using the second SIM will deactivate the first SIM mobile number from iMessage.\n\nA: You can add a second iPhone phone number to an iPad - you sign into the second iPhone with your Apple ID and the go to iMessage and select 'use iMessage with my Apple ID'.  The phone number of the second iPhone will appear on the iPad. \n\nA: You can't add another phone number to the same Apple ID, but you can add another e-mail address instead.\nGo to Settings -> Messages -> Send & Receive and 'Add Another E-mail...' there.\n", "Q: How do I correct wrong iTunes play counts? The play count in my iTunes library has somehow become incorrect. It shows some songs as never been played while I know that I have played them many times before. These songs do still have a \"last played\" date though. \nAlso, some songs are being listed as only played once, while I know they have been played multiple times. \nI have an iPhone 4S, with iOS 6.0.1, iTunes 11. My PC is a VAIO running on Windows 7. I have a backup of my iTunes account. I think the problem started after I updated my iTunes account to version 11.\nWhat I need is to get my original play count data back. Can anyone help me with this?\n\nA: There's a bug in iTunes 11 where the play count isn't updated if you have crossfading of tracks turned on in the playback settings.  This might account for some of it. \n\nA: Here's the real, heavy duty power solution:\nUse Notepad to create a new file named: iTunes_SetPlayCount.VBS\nUse this script:\n\nDim iTunesApp, selectedTracks, newPlayCount\nDim prompt, title, defaultValue\n\nSet iTunesApp = WScript.CreateObject(\"iTunes.Application\")\nSet selectedTracks = iTunesApp.SelectedTracks\n\nprompt = \"New playcount:\"\n\nFor Each IITTrack In selectedTracks\n    title = IITTrack.Artist & \" - \" & IITTrack.Name\n    defaultValue = IITTrack.PlayedCount\n    newPlayCount = InputBox (prompt, title, defaultValue)\n\n    'MsgBox(\"NewPlayCount = \" & newPlayCount)\n\n    If Len(newPlayCount) > 0 Then\n        If IsNumeric(newPlayCount) Then\n            If newPlayCount >= 0 Then \n                IITTrack.PlayedCount = newPlayCount\n            End If\n        End If\n    Else\n        Exit For\n    End If\nNext\n\n\nKaaBAM!\n\nA: For minor play count screwups, I use a little AppleScript to set the count:\ntell application \"iTunes\"\n  activate\n  set played count of track named \"Vaseline Machine Gun\" to 16\n  return\nend tell\n\nObviously this can be elaborated to handle more complicated situations involving multiple tracks and playlists.\n\nA: Summary\nIf you quit iTunes and empty the contents of your iTunes Library.itl file, then iTunes will rebuild your library from the contents of iTunes Media Library.xml. Make sure it's up to date by exporting your library and copying the file, and then edit the play counts inside. When you restart iTunes, it will use the XML file and your edited information will be accepted.\nStep-by-step\nRetrieve previous information:\nIf you have backups of your iTunes library, find the most recent version of iTunes Media Library.xml from before the problem. Within this file, search for the songs whose play counts you want to restore. You'll be looking for this:\n<key>Play Count</key><integer>1337</integer>\nNow you know what the accurate play counts were. Copy and paste them into a text file or something so you can put them in your current library next.\nModify current library:\nThis is the tricky part, so back up your files before editing them.\n\n\n*\n\n*Use File > Library > Export Library… to get an up-to-date XML representation of your library. I'll refer to this file as Library.xml.\n\n*Exit iTunes and use the Task Manager to make sure it (and the iTunes Helper) are well and truly dead.\n\n*Navigate to your iTunes folder. Replace the contents of iTunes Media Library.xml and iTunes Library.xml with your newly created Library.xml. This will ensure that they're up to date.\n\n*Change the play counts in the iTunes Media Library.xml file. This file is about to become the basis for your library's metadata.\n\n*Remove the contents of your iTunes Library.itl file. The file itself needs to exist, but it must be empty so that iTunes will fall back to iTunes Media Library.xml. (more info) If everything works, you will not need the old contents of this file.\n\n*Restart iTunes. It will report that your library is corrupted, so it will fall back to the XML file that you've edited and rebuild the .itl file. After it's finished, you'll see the play counts from iTunes Media Library.xml.\n\nI haven't verified that there's absolutely no data loss with this method, but my library appeared fully intact when I tested it with iTunes 11 on OS X 10.8. Always back up your files before tweaking. Enjoy!\n\nA: One way to correct the wrong playcount is to open a previous Itunes library and adjust the playcounts manually.\nYou could load the old library (which in my case is pretty similar to the new one, since it is only 1 month old) and manually adjust the playcounts (by playing the songs an extra number of times) and also manually adjust newly added songs etc. Of course, you could also just use the old library to identify wrong play counts and adjust them in the new library.\nHow to load the old library? Hold down SHIFT while you open Itunes (first press SHIFT, keep holding it down, then open Itunes). Itunes will ask you which Itunes library you want to open, click “Choose Library”, then click the folder “Previous Itunes Libraries”. Within that folder you will find a number of old ITL files (ITL stands for Itunes Library File, these files contain metadata like playcount etc.), choose the one with the date before you updated your Itunes to version 11 (in my case the name of the file was “iTunes Library 2012-12-02”). Itunes will now open the old library with the old playcounts, song names, last played etc. You can go back to the new library with the same SHIFT procedure but then choose \"iTunes Library\" in the \"iTunes\" folder.\nComparing the playcounts of the old and new library can( for example) be done in Excel. Simply select all the songs in Itunes (CTRL A, CTRL C) and paste them in Excel (CTRL V), don’t forget to sort by name first.\nHope this helps.\nCiao, Raphie\n\nA: Ultraduty super power solution;\nSet play time to one second, click play in itunes on the the file as many times as needed.\nWhaBAM.\n\nA: For Windows you can either use the scripts from http://liquidparallax.com/2007/06/09/windows-itunes-scripts-downloads/ \nOr I wrote an updated version with a dialogue box available at http://zagz.com/update-play-count-itunes-windows/ Chrome won't let you download the script as it is a zipped windows script file so use Firefox or something else to get it.\n", "Q: external drive network security I work in an office where all user accounts are on a server, the admin has access to all the screens and devices though the network.\nHow can I protect the drive I connect to my system from my snoopy admin?\nEncryption is useless since when I enter the password and mount the device, it becomes available when the admin logs in my system remotely.\n\nA: If the admin has access to the computer remotely while you are logged in then there isnt much you can do about it.

Went into disk utility and erased the lion partition before the re-install. \nNow when I go into the app store it thinks that all the apps that I have installed through the app store are already installed on the computer. It seems that the app store is consulting apples servers rather than my local machine so I can't install any of the apps because the buttons say the app is already installed. \nHow can I tell the app store that it's wrong that apps are not installed locally. \n\nA: The App Store app only consults spotlight for your Mac to determine if an app is installed, so we can rule out any account problem (and you can sign out of the account from the store and reboot to confirm this on your system.)\nSo, since you have a few apps, you can focus on one app app and check spotlight to see if there are copies of it elsewhere than in /Applications.\nSome helpful hints:\n\n\n*\n\n*be sure to eject all disks except for the one drive you are booted from\n\n*consider rebuilding your spotlight index after checking for apps on other volumes by ejecting the volumes\n\n", "Q: Work offline in Google Drive on iPad Is there a way to work offline on a Google Drive document on an iPad?\nI'm aware it's possible on a desktop or laptop when using Chrome, but I can't seem to see an option for such a functionality in the Google Drive app.\nYou can make a file available offline, but you can only view it if you do that.

How is Safari updated in OS X? I know this seems like a simple question, but I cant find any good documentation on it. I know of a software update tool that would prompt you for updates on windows, but I would like to know how this is currently done on OS X.\nThe reasoning for my question is I am comparing browser auto-update functionality and am working on documentation to support plans to guarantee certain extents of browser compatibility for a product. The documentation for Safari seems a little lacking so pointers to an authoritative source would be most welcome in addition to an answer from experience. \n\nA: In OS X, Safari is updated via the normal system bundled software update process. On Lion, this is the Apple Menu, Software Update tool which can be scheduled or disabled.\nOn Mountain Lion, this function remains in the Apple Menu, but runs through the Mac App Store app\nhttp://www.apple.com/softwareupdate/\nIn the end, both tools call softwareupdate binary that you can also run from the command line. \nThis differs from your Windows experience where the Apple Software Update tool runs to update all Apple software (Safari, QuickTime, iTunes, etc.) since it is not part of Microsoft's software update process.\n", "Q: Time Capsule: \"There was a problem connecting to the server\" I have a dream:  The dream of using my MBP inside and outside my office, and having it backup to my 2TB Time Capsule when on its wireless network, or postpone backups when not on the Time Capsule's wireless network.\nUnfortunately, if I've been on a different wireless network for a few hours worth of backup attempts, bringing the machine back onto the Time Capsule's wireless network doesn't clear up the problem.  I can select the disk as a backup drive in the Time Machine preferences, but the disk remains unavailable from the Finder, and any backup attempts yield the standard:\n\nThere was a problem connecting to the \n  server \"Max Time Capsule\"\nCheck the server name or IP address, and then try \n  again.  If you continue to have problems, contact your \n  system administrator.\n\nMy WiFi connection is through the same Time Capsule that hosts the backup drive, and its name and IP address have decidedly not changed.  The only thing that seems to help is restarting the Time Capsule, but that is an inconvenient workaround at best.\nThe problem sounds similar to Backup Disk Not Available, but the answers to that question are either to restart or change the disk name or turn off the 5 GHz network (which didn't help).  I also looked at /Library/Preferences/com.apple.TimeCapsule.plist, but found nothing that seemed relevant.\nAny suggestions would be greatly appreciated.  My MBP is running OS X 10.7.5, and the Time Capsule firmware is 7.6.1.\n\nA: I experience issues like this from time to time.

I have iMessage on my iPhone 5, and I signed in to iMessage on my iPad 2.\nWill it cost extra to have iMessage on my iPad 2?\nI think iMessage might be free but I'm still curious.\n\nA: Messages is free if you are texting someone with the email address ( which is the only thing available on the iPad). If you are on the iPhone and texting another phone, then it will count as a text for the service provider. However, any iOS 5 and above device has messages installed and it is free. \n\nA: iMessage is entirely free.\nYou can use any iOS or OSX 10.8 (or greater) device to iMessage any other iOS or OSX 10.8 (or greater) that has iMessage enabled. You can enable any iMessage account on as many compatible devices that you would like for no additional charge.\nThat said, there is one slight caveat of which I'm sure you are aware. If you text, from iPhone Messages.app, someone's cell phone number who doesn't have iMessage (or doesn't have it enabled on their cell phone), then your service provider may (depending on your plan) charge you for a SMS text message. This is an important distinction, because, unlike what iKiel2012 said, all other iPhone iMessaging is free. \nAlso keep in mind the difference between \"Messages\" - a particular iOS/OSX app - and \"iMessage\" - a somewhat alternative to SMS text messages. You only mentioned iMessage - the service offered by Apple - which is entirely free no matter who you iMessage (but again, one cannot iMessage a non-iMessage user).\n", "Q: Why are the network connections in the Network System Preference panel mislabeled?

Why? My 2 terabyte Time Capsule used to allow a guest wifi network but since I had to switch to bridge mode to accommodate my cable internet provider (while installing an Exchange server w/o a static ip address) I no longer have the guest option. \nWhy?\nIs there a workaround?\n\nA: When placing the Time Capsule in Bridge mode, you are turning off NAT, and IP operations.\nThe ability for guests to be able to get to the Internet but not be able to access the home network was a result of access rules that stated the IP range that supports the guest network are not allowed to talk to the other internal network.  It is possible to do such a thing using a technology known as private-VLANs, but I don't think the Time Capsule has that sophisticated of code.  So, when we put our router into bridge mode, we become one layer 2 ethernet bridged network - that is bridged to the Access Point - within one IP network.\nThere does not appear to be the code necessary to do layer 2 (ethernet/wireless ethernet) separation and security.

I have a Mac, a Power PC G5 desktop, running MAC OS X 10.5.8, the last release made for this machine. I've been having a lot of problems lately with Safari; when I launch it, I get a spinning disc, and then Safari becomes unresponsive. My only option is to Force Quit. \nIdeally, I'd like to resolve whatever is causing the issue.\nFailing that, I'd like to somehow get to all my bookmarks. I just don't know enough about the inner workings of the computer to find where those are stored and how to access them.\n\nA: The bookmarks are stored in ~/Library/Safari/Bookmarks.html\nTriaging the crashing app might be as simple as moving the entire preference folder and plist file to the desktop or might take more work. \n\nA: Actually bookmarks are in ~/Library/Safari/Bookmarks.plist\nThat file open up in Apple's Property List Editor.app not the easiest way to get things out.  (Tip option-click the disclose-triangle to open the entire tree view)\n...so you are probably best off repairing what's wrong with Safari that's keeping it from starting.\nTry force quitting it, then renaming (or backing & removing) the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*~/Library/Caches/Safari whole directory\n\n*~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.Safari.plist\n\n*~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.Safari.RSS.plist\nIf you are still wedged after that, fall back to trying to the generic mac debugging tips (repair permissions, etc)\n", "Q: When I read an email on my iPad I am not receiving it on my laptop - how do I sync them? I am using YAHOO email on my MacBook Pro and my iPad and iPhone - but when  I open an email on my iPad it is not showing up on my laptop or iPhone. How do I get all of my emails on all of my devices?\nAlso - when I send a message via my iPad it also is not syncing to my other devices, so when a friend replies, it shows on my iPad but not my iPhone. \n\nA: In order to have your email sync on multiple devices, make sure your account is set up to use the IMAP protocol. Most free services, like Yahoo!, are set to use POP by default, which does not sync.\nGo to your Yahoo! account settings at yahoo.com and change it to use the protocol to IMAP. You will have to then delete/change the email account on your iPad, and set it up as IMAP as well.\n\nA: I suspect the iPad email client is configured to automatically remove email from the server once read. \nCheck the mail account settings on the iPad and make sure 'Delete from server' is set to never.\n\nA: I had the same problem with my iPhone and HP laptop.  To correct it I went to settings and removed the \"important conversations\" label.  The feature allowed Gmail to present what it believed to important conversations which for some reason filtered out what I could see on my laptop.  \n", "Q: Animate textual changes in keynote I have some bullet points and I want to animate a change to some of them.

Or split the bullets into separate objects? Or is there a way to animate text changes?\nI also want to animate some similar text changes in non-bullet text (inserting/removing/changing words/lines) - can this be done easily or again would I need to somehow have two overlapping versions and animate one in and the other out simultaneously, or split the bits I want to move around into different objects?\nI can figure out the details but I need some steer on the best overall approach.\n\nA: If I understand you correctly, you want the first bullet point to exit stage left, and have its replacement arrive from stage right. Then repeat wi point three. \nCreate each bullet point in its own text box. You can manually mimic the build in to match the rest of your presentation. Once the slide's build is complete, the easiest animation might be with a couple of additional slides set to Magic Move. \n\n\n*\n\n*slide 1, original text in place; bullet 1 replacement off screen\n\n*slide 2, bullet 1 replacement in-line, original off screen, bullet 3 replacement off screen\n\n*slide 3, bullet 3 original off screen, mullet 3 replacement in-line\n\n\nIf you're familiar with the Magic Move transition, this should make sense.

I want to use it locked, but is there a jailbreak?\n\nA: As of January 2013, there is no jailbreak for iOS 6.

Is there a way to make Finder always expand to \"Show All\" by default in \"Icon View\"?\nI am referring to this situation where the \"Show All\" is collapsed by default: \n\n\nA: I have a two-part answer for you. The short answer is no, you cannot \"Show All\" by default in the Icon view you are using.\nThe good news, and second part of the answer, is that you can change the folder View settings to eliminate this completely.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open one of the folders with which you are having an issue.\n\n*Select Show View Options from the View menu.\n\n*Change the Arranged By setting to Name or None.\n\n*Then Select Sort By to whatever way you prefer.

If you populate a folder with only sub-folders (no other file types) then the 'show all' remains the default when you leave and re-enter the folder. Also, I mysteriously have one folder on my mac with multiple file types where the 'show all' option appears to be the default. Definitely a bug.\n\nA: Update: like Alex said - but you need to click the \"Help\" option and type \"Sort By\" in order to get the menu to give you a sort-by option - it does not show up by default, but the \"help\" option somehow activates it to show.\n", "Q: Why my photos are missing in iPhoto events but not in Aperture projects? All my iPhoto events are empty. If I open a event there are no photos in it. But when I use the Photos perspective I can see all my photos!\nIn Aperture I see all my photos in the Photos perspective and in projects (= iPhoto events).\nHow I can repair my iPhoto library?\nI already tried to repair and rebuild my hole library with iPhoto an Aperture!\n\nA: Download iPhoto Library Manager and use its rebuild function. (In Library Manager it's the FIle -> Rebuild command) \nThis will create an entirely new library. It will then copy (or try to) your photos and all the associated metadata and versions to this new Library, and arrange it as close as it can to what you had in the damaged Library. It does this based on information it finds in the iPhoto sharing mechanism - but that means that things not shared won't be there, so no slideshows, books or calendars, for instance - but it should get all your events, albums and keywords, faces and places back.\nBecause this process creates an entirely new library and leaves your old one untouched, it is non-destructive, and if you're not happy with the results you can simply return to your old one.   \n", "Q: Manually managing songs and deleting from playlist I want to be able to delete songs off my iPhone by swiping in the Music.app. I know having 'Manually Manage songs' lets you delete songs without them returning after you re-sync everything, but I want it to delete songs from the playlist I have. \nI have a playlist for the songs on my phone because I don't want to go through thousands of songs every time I reformat the phone. Manually managing songs just removes it from my phone but not from my playlist. \nIs there any way around this?\n\nA: Speaking for iOS 6 (not necessarily older versions):\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Music.app\n\n*Select \"Playlists\" tab.\n\n*Create a new Playlist and put a few songs in there.\n\n*Sync your iPhone to to your computer (Wifi or USB)\n\n*Make sure iTunes is configured to sync your music and choose \"Selected playlists, artists, albums, and genres\n\n*My experience was that the playlist I created was automatically selected under \"Playlists\" in the Music tab of iTunes. If it isn't, select it.\n\n*You can now put any song you would like in there and sync.\n\n\nWhile it doesn't automatically sync every time a change is made, any time you sync it will reflect changes made on your device. For example, put 10 songs into your new playlist and sync with your iPhone. Then, go into your iPhone and delete a few of those songs out. Sync with iTunes. They shouldn't be in the playlist on iTunes anymore. \nI have personally performed the steps to ensure they work. It's not 100% automatic, but with Wifi sync, it is almost that way.\n\nA: Instead of manually managing your music, you want to have a single playlist synced to your iPhone. Then when you remove something from the playlist on your phone, it will be removed from the playlist on your computer, as well.\n\nUncheck \"Manually manage music and videos,\" and then go to the \"Music\" tab. Instead of choosing to sync your entire music library, choose \"Selected playlists…\" and only enable the one(s) you want synced.\nI have confirmed that this solves your question, though only if you edit the playlist itself. In other words, when you swipe to delete something from your library (artist/album/genre/etc.) instead of the synced playlist, it returns on the next sync.\n\nIt can be hard to find and delete a single song in a long playlist, so I'd recommend syncing a folder of playlists instead of just one monolithic one.\n", "Q: How can I create a custom colored icon font?

I'm looking for a better alternative for top. Both top and Activity Monitor are highly limited with regards to features. In particular, I'm interested in the following features:\n\n\n*\n\n*Limit processes by name\n\n*Send different kill-signals to a process interactively, i.e. select the process from the process list and send a signal\n\n*Ability to show the entire command, not only the program name (as top -c does on Linux)\n\n*Show the status of each process\n\n*Optional: On Linux, top also updates the command when displayed, i.e. if a process writes in it's own argv during runtime, the updated command will be shown.\n\n\nHtop is not an option, as it is unstable on Mac OS and only a small subset of it's features actually works on a Darwin system, probably because it partially relies on procfs. Is there a build or fork of htop that works on OS X since it has the features I want if it worked as it does on Linux?\n\nA: You can install htop on Mac through brew with the following command:\nbrew install htop-osx \nDon' t forget to grant root privileges after the installation.\n\nA: Sending of signals and filtering by user is available out of the box.

It's modeled after Linux top, and is much more powerful than Apple's own.\n", "Q: Navionics mobile app for iPad 3 I am planning to buy the Navionics app for iPad: does it require a Wi-Fi or cellular connection to use the Navionics maps for navigation?\n\nA: The iPad without cellular connection does not have GPS onboard, so you cannot use it reliably for navigation. It does have very limited location awareness when it comes in range of Wi-Fi hotspots that have been cataloged into the iOS location database and also falls in the subset of this database that gets loaded onto your device for offline use.\nThe maps themselves are designed to function fully without a data connection, so although you might not get updates or supplemental data while the iPad data connection is offline, an iPad models with cellular radios and GPS chips will work well for navigation apps such as Navionics even when you are out of range of all Wi-Fi and cellular towers due to the design of the software, the OS and the GPS chips embedded in the iPad.\n", "Q: iTerm2 save window/tabs on exit?

Is it possible to access an external HDD or USB drive encrypted on Lion, through a Mac running Leopard?\nIn other words, is FileVault 2 encryption on volumes/partitions backwards compatible? (It really should be.)\n\nA: No - OS X older than Lion cannot read or comprehend/mount/use a Core Storage volume such as used with FileVault 2.\nSomeone could reverse engineer the protocol and write drivers for older OS or different OS, but I haven't even seen a start towards that effort in any open source project.\n", "Q: how do I create a resource (room) in Exchange so it can be viewed like a calendar using iCal/Calendar? We use Exchange 2010 and a mix of Macs and Windows PCs. However we are 75% or more Mac users. Most using Macs use iCal/Calendar and not Outlook.\nWe can create a resource/room that shows up in the location option when creating a new event. That works just fine. However we would like to be able to view this as a daily/weekly/monthly view using iCal (10.7) or Calendar (10.8). \nIs it possible to see all the booked times for a given period (daily, weekly, monthly view like in a personal calendar)? Right now we have to create an event, add the room as the location, add an invitee and then look at the 'show availability' option to see times. It only shows one day at a time and requires you scroll through day after day to see a particular day.\nReason we would like this is we use the room for meetings, but visitors use it for internet, reading, etc. We would like our admin to be able to quickly look up the rooms availability for the day to let them know if/when it is open.  \n\nA: There is no way to directly view Availability (free/busy) information in either Apple iCal/Calendar (Snow Leopard, Lion, or Mountain Lion) or Microsoft Outlook 2011 (through SP2, at least) for an Exchange 2007/2010 room or equipment resource.\nHowever, you can grant shared access for your account(s) to the Exchange resource calendar through Exchange management tools. Once that is done, you can add it the client for review of its schedule, as if it were another person's calendar for which you have sharing/delegation rights.\nApple iCal/Calendar: Preferences > Accounts > Select your Exchange account > Delegation tab. Click the \"+\" to add the resource calendar for which you have access.\nMicrosoft Outlook 2011: File > Open > Other User's Folder. Enter the resource calendar's information as the User and choose \"Calendar\" as the Type.\nAs long as your account has shared access to the resource calendar, you will be able to see it listed as another calendar in either application's sidebar.

Note: it does not have DVI or HDMI ports.\nWhen I plug it into an iMac using VGA and the Mini Display Port adapter, it is fine (using the native resolution).\nHowever, when I plug it into my MacBook using the same setup, it is unable to determine the correct resolution for it. (It thinks it is 4:3 and uses 1024x768, but in fact it is 16:9.)\nAnyone know how I might fix this problem? There are no alternatives in the display settings.\n\nA: Not all monitors are the same - I bought a monitor from a friend to use for extra screen space space with my 13\"MBP (Mid 2009). It was a nice VGA widescreen LCD monitor but no matter what I tried my MacBook Pro could not send any kind of signal to it. All connectors were verified to work perfectly well and the monitor also worked perfectly well when attached to a nearby PC... \n", "Q: Is it possible to change the font and button size of the format bar in numbers '09 I need to increase the size of buttons and front on the format bar in numbers '9\n\nA: Depending on your hardware, you can change the Display preference to alter the resolution which indirectly controls how large the graphical elements on screen are drawn. This doesn't target just the numbers format bar, but affects all text and elements on the screen.\nWith a retina Mac, you have more control over this with the text and items being drawn with retina precision, yet the overall scaling of the graphical elements can be made larger or smaller to your liking. This is basically an implementation of resolution independence for those hardware displays.\nIf you need to target just the format bar, you can only choose to display or not display text and choose the default or the smaller icons using this control in the preferences for the toolbar.\n\n", "Q: MacBook Air and external USB 3.0 hard drive I have EEB-40S-U3 with 500GB Seagate Momentus inside and 2012 MacBook Air 13\". When I connect HDD case to laptop nothing happens: I don't hear any sound from HDD itself, volumes does not appear in Disk Utility.app, nothing changes in USB section in System Information.app and no new lines appear in system.log. I suspect that MacBook Air just does not supply enough power for drive. What are the possible solutions?\nCase and drive itself work fine with old ASUS X51L laptop, which supports only USB 2.0. I also tried to connect case via USB 2.0 cable, but that didn't help.\n\nA: If two Air don't power the same drive and you've tried several cables, you might need to talk to the drive manufacturer. MacBook Air can power a SuperDrive that triggers a high power mode on the USB ports, and I have seen reports that they can push well over 950 mA to burn a DVD. \nBasically, it's unlikely two MAcBook are are both under-powering one hard drive and more likely the drive only asks for 500 mA and that's not enough to power the drive's controller or perhaps that drive/controller is simply out of spec.\nYou can refer to Apple's KB article that covers USB 3 devices getting 900 mA at 5V as a feature of the MacBook Air, so that should be plenty of power for a drive to operate. \nYou might need to seek service for either the Air or the drive if you can't fix things with trying other cables. The operation with other devices is nice, but in the end, if you need it to work with the Air, you'll need to work through that by repair/replacement of something.\nUsing the System Information tool on OS X, you should be able to determine if the USB chipset is sending any data over to the Air - whether or not it is getting enough power or even getting to the point where it can signal how much power it would like as part of the USB enumeration process.\n\nA: If your MacBook Air is a USB 3.0 version, then you have 900mAH our of your USB 3.0 port which can power up most of the 2.5\" HDD 5400rpm or 7200 rpm.\nI have Toshiba that needs 1A, Hitachi needs 700 mah, WD, 550 mah.\nMost likely, you can power up Hitachi and WD.\nIf your MacBook Air is USB 2.0 version, then you will need two cable since each port only provide 500 mah.\n", "Q: DisplayLink Screen Saver Issues I am running OSX Lion 10.7.5 (can't upgrade yet due to corp policy) on my MBP 13\" 2011.  I run with the lid closed connected to two displays:\n\n\n*\n\n*HP 24\" via DisplayPort/DVI adapter\n\n*Dell 24\" via Diamond BVU195 USB/DVI adapter\n\n\nProblem:  Intermittently, when I go to lock my screen (an Automator app that starts the screen saver), the screen saver won't start.  If I unplug the DisplayLink from the USB port, this instantly fixes the issue.  I can then reconnect the DisplayLink and the screen saver appears on both screens simultaneously.  Likewise, sometimes when I return to my desk and go to unlock my screen, the display hangs; it's black on both screens with visible mouse cursor but no image.  If I unplug the DisplayLink, again this immediately fixes the issue.\nI've made sure I'm on the latest DisplayLink driver.  What else can I do to fix this so I don't have to frequently disconnect the DisplayLink device?\n\nA: I also noticed screensaver problems after installing a USB-DisplayLink adapter on my Mid 2012 MacBookPro.  Except my problem is that periodically screensaver kicks in even though I've been typing and mousing.  There are screensaver error messages in /var/log/system.log but I'm not sure they are related to this issue.\nAll screens except the DisplayLink screen blank out.  FWIW, I use a USB keyboard almost exclusively, and wonder if that is part of the problem.\n", "Q: How to set alternatives in 10.8? On Linux you can use update-alternative to change the version of a command.\nWhich command in OS X (10.8) will switch the alternative of the current command?\n\nA: I understand the motivation behind your question. update-alternatives elegantly solves the problem of managing several installed versions of a program (for example Java) or different ports of a program (vim vs. elvis vs. vile) by making one of them the default one.\nupdate-alternatives, found in many Linux distros, creates and manages a set of symlinks from /bin, /usr/bin (and the like) to /etc/alternatives, and from there to the location where the program is installed. \nFor example, in openSUSE java is symlinked to /etc/alternatives/java, which is symlinked to a \"private\" path where java resides:\n/usr/bin/java -> /etc/alternatives/java\n/etc/alternatives/java -> /usr/lib64/jvm/java-1.5.0-sun-1.5.0/jre/bin/java\n\nUnfortunately, and although some think it would be necessary, at least for MacPorts, there is no such thing in OS X. I have personally solved the lack of update-alternatives with aliases in my .bashrc:\nalias ls='/usr/local/bin/ls'\n\nor simply changing $PATH:\nPATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH\n\nIf you can't solve it like this and are weighing the fact of porting it to OS X be aware that although update-alternatives' first incarnation was a Perl script, it was rewritten in C for Debian, and some other distros adopted it later (for instance openSUSE 12.1). \nopenSUSE 11.4 provides the Perl version as an RPM package. If you are looking for the C version, go for any recent Ubuntu or Debian release, or openSUSE 12.1 or later.\n\nA: Macports supports this capability via 'port select' for many language packages, mysql, and others.  (I'm using version MacPorts 2.4.2.)\n", "Q: Epson software update keeps popping up on my screen but nothing gets downloaded \nI get that question pop-up on my screen a few times per day.

All my software is up to date. \nSelecting No closes the dialog but it may reappear again in seconds. \nI got tired of this, removed my printer from Print/Scan settings, used Epson uninstaller utility (found on their site) to remove their drivers and software from the system, rebooted the machine, plugged in my printer back and OS X downloaded drivers and installed them again. All was well for about a week. Today this started again. Any insight into fixing this would be appreciated.\n\nA: Just talked with Epson support. I had already removed the printer from System Preferences > Print & Scan, but when I tried to add the printer back it said the software could not be found. In talking with Epson this what he had me do:\n\n\n*\n\n*I had already removed the printer so do this first.\n\n*Open System Preferences > Print & Scan, right-click in the list of printers on the left, and choose \"Reset printing system...\"\n\n*Run the Software Update under the Apple menu. (Being Mountain Lion this opened the App Store application. However, there were no software updates for me.)\n\n*Restart computer.\n\n*Open System Preferences > Print & Scan and add the printer again.\n\n\nIt was able to add the printer, and now the dialog box in @King Julian's post is not showing for me.

I ordered a cheap case on Amazon and it works fine. However, the disk is still unreadable by my iMac. How do I reformat the hard drive (in Disk Utility?) so that I can use it to just store files for me?\nWhen I plugged my hard drive into my computer, a message came up saying that it was unreadable by this operating system. I opened up Disk Utility and I can view it there. \nThe main essence of my question is what can I do from an application like Disk Utility that will enable me to use the hard drive for file storage on my mac.\nDetails on the hard drive:\n\n\n*\n\n*Case connects to SATA which is an adapter to a USB cable. \n\n*Connected through USB 2.0 to built in USB port on my iMac 10.8.2\n\n\nA: Have you opened Disk Utility and tried to format it already? Sometimes a drive will not appear on the desktop, but will appear in Disk Utility.\nI've had windows drives show up sometimes, and not other times. What you could do to make it more likely to show up is go to an available (hopefully not too difficult) windows machine and reformat the drive as a FAT/MS-DOS drive (don't do quick-format). This should be easier for the mac to see.\nOnce you can see the blank FAT formatted drive, open Disk Utility and then select it on the left sidebar and erase it again as a \"Mac OS Extended (Journaled)\" (HFS+) format.\nThere are other methods like using an emulation environment like Parallels Desktop (IMHO bad SW company), VMWare Fusion (my choice), or VirtualBox (free) (all of these require a windows install disc); or you could even try using programs like MacFuse or NTFS-3G, Tuxera, etc., to mount windows (NTFS) drives directly in the Finder. But unless a mac you can find has one of these solutions, it's probably not worth it to go through the trouble just to erase one drive.\nLastly, I've also had some external USB enclosures not show up on some versions of OS X! So the cheapy enclosure you got just might not work with your installation anyway?\nDetails that might be helpful for potential helpers:\nHD interface PATA/ATA/IDE or SATA?\nOS X Version?\niMac model year or identifier?\nEnclosure is assumed to be USB 2.0 high speed plugged into built-in port on iMac. Correct if wrong.\n", "Q: Backing up to an internal drive of another machine I have a mac laptop that I want to back up to an internal drive on my Mac Pro. The drive I want to back up to is blank and not the OS drive. They are connected via ethernet, but I do not see the drive on my computer. How would I be able to recognize it?\n\nA: You have two options to allow Time Machine on your Mac to use an internal drive on another Mac Pro as the destination for normal backups from your MacBook.\nNeither is a great option, but here they are.\n\n\n*\n\n*Load OS X server on the Pro and set it up minimally to share that drive as a Time Machine backup destination. Your Mac will see the drive as long as the two computers have any sort of network connection and your Mac will quite happily send files to it's server as if it were a Time Capsule or other NAS device that supports Time Machine.\n\n*Shut down the Mac Pro and boot it in Target Disk Mode. This involves less expense (if you already have a FireWire or Thunderbolt cable) and less setup time (server could take hours to set up the first time) but it means you can't use the Mac Pro when the MacBook needs to back up. It also means you can't use the ethernet (or any other network) to perform the backup. Thunderbolt is practically limited to 2 meters by the longest copper cable being sold and the max length it could be is 3 meters until a fiber optic version of the protocol gets released. FireWire can work up to 100 meters, but cables that long are pricey and rare.\nSince neither of these is a good option, you could also look at getting some free software like CrashPlan. This software would be installed on both computers and each could back up to the other (or you could only back the portable to the Pro - one way backup) and you could have all the files stored on the one drive.\nThe downside is it's not Time Machine - but it is quite solid software that many, many businesses depend upon for valuable data.\nSorry there isn't a quick - do this and that to make the Pro serve up a drive as a Time Machine destination - but hopefully one of the three options will let you work out a plan.\n\nA: I routinely use Time Machine to back up a MacBook Air, a MacBook Pro, and several Mac minis to a Mac Pro with two 1.5 TB internal hard drives. It is relatively straightforward, but there is a caveat.\nYou need to have the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*An account on the Mac Pro.\n\n*File sharing turned on in the System Preferences. Make sure you are sharing the extra hard drive. This is automatic if you are using an admin account. Your user name also needs to have read/write access to the drive.\n\n*Network access between your MacBook and the Mac Pro. The Mac Pro can't be behind a firewall, for example\n\n\nSetup\nOn your laptop, you need to connect to the shared volume on the Mac Pro. Look under the \"Shared\" category in the Finder side bar. If both machines are on the same subnet, Bonjour should automatically make the Mac Pro visible. If they are on different subnets, you may need to connect manually. In this case, select \"Go->Connect to Server\" in the Finder (cmd-K) and enter \"afp://macpro.example.com/\". (Obviously you need to use your Mac Pro's actual domain name here.)\nOnce you have mounted the shared drive, go into System Preferences and select Time Machine. In the preference pane, click \"Select Disk...\". Your mounted volume should now appear as an option for Time Machine backups. Go ahead and select it.\nMake sure to keep the remote volume mounted while Time Machine makes its first backup. Time Machine will prompt you for the username and password to store in the Keychain so that it can mount the disk on its own for future backups.\nFor future backups, Time Machine will automatically mount the remote volume using the credentials you provided, make a backup, and then disconnect the volume. There is no more work on your part.\nWhen you need to recover a file, \"Enter Time Machine\" as you normally would. Time Machine will automatically mount the remote disk (assuming it is available) and go into file recovery mode. It will be slower than a locally connected disk, but it will work.\nThe Caveat\nAlthough Time Machine will work normally, there is an important difference if you need to make a complete recovery from the Time Machine backup on the Mac Pro. In my case, for example, my MacBook Pro fell off a table and hit a hardwood floor, which damaged the internal hard drive. Once I got a new hard drive installed, I needed to recover from the Time Machine backup on my Mac Pro.\nAt the time, I had the OS X install disk, but the following comments should also apply to recovery disk mode under Lion. When going through the recovery process, the installer will ask if you want to restore from a Time Machine backup. Unfortunately, you will not find your backup disk in the list. The problem is that the volume you want to use is not available because the Mac Pro is not running OS X Server and is not broadcasting that it is a \"Time Capsule\". (See bmike's first bullet in his answer to this question.) The solution is to bring up a terminal window and manually mount your Time Machine backup on the command line. See the mount_afp manual page for documentation on how to do this.\nOnce you have the remote disk mounted, go through the normal recovery process. Your Time Machine backup should now be available as an option. It can take several hours to do a full restore over a network connection like this. In my case, I was able to fully recover from the accident.\nI hope this helps.\n", "Q: I can't re-download a song with iTunes on my PC or iPhone I bought an album yesterday from iTunes on my PC, downloaded it, and synced it with my iPhone.  When I later tried to play the songs on the phone, I noticed that they wouldn't play at all.  I also noticed that they wouldn't play on the PC.  So, I tried to follow the suggestion in this other question and deleted the songs, thinking I could just re-download them.  I can't seem to actually re-download these.\n\n\n*\n\n*I locate the album in the iTunes store from iTunes on my PC.\n\n*I click \"buy\" for the album.\n\n*I see a pop-up box from iTunes telling me I have already purchased this item and can redownload it from my Purchases.  \n\n*I click the \"Purchased\" button on the pop-up dialog.\n\n*iTunes takes me to \"Purchased\" screen, but I do not see the artist or any of the songs from that artist in my purchased music list.\n\n\nAlso, when I try to download it from iTunes directly from my iPhone, the album shows up with a \"purchased\" box next to it already and is unclickable.\nI am using iTunes 11 on my PC and have iOS 6.0.1 on the iPhone.\nHow can I get this music?\n\nA: I had this exact same problem and I tried the same solution you did: deleted the file and could not redownload. It just said \"Purchased\" and there was no option to redownload. It turns out that I must have selected to \"hide\" the purchase. I fixed this by going to my account settings in itunes and clicking \"view hidden purchases\". Low and behold, my missing file was there. I clicked the \"unhide\" button and was able to download it again from the itunes store.\n\nA: I found the solution!\nYou have to go back to iTunes and instead of going to the album, go to the songs it previews right below it. The missing songs will have the \"buy $???\" Option. You need to select that option, and once you do it will say you have already purchased it and will ask if you want to download again for free. Say yes and your missing song(s) will download. \nRepeat step for all other missing songs individually.\n\nA: I found a way to obtain \"PURCHASED\" tracks on a new release. This doesn't involve deleting or hiding purchases. It may involve paying for tracks you obtained on a prior release, but that's expected as it's a new release even if the track is the same.\n\n*\n\n*\"Complete the album\" as normal; this downloads any tracks it detects as non-purchased, but does not deliver \"PURCHASED\" tracks.\n\n\n*Find a $0.99 button (or other price) [instead of PURCHASED] for the remaining tracks. I found these in two areas: (A) on the mobile store: anywhere the tracks are displayed outside of the album view, such as in the Songs subcategory in a search for the artist; (B) in the desktop app, in the downloaded album in your library: select to show all tracks, including non-downloaded. For the tracks I couldn't find in A, I used B.\n\n\n*Obtain the tracks using the $0.99 button (or other price). In some cases, it may say you purchased this track previously so you can download it for free. In other cases, it may be a new purchase. (I'm not sure whether this directly relates to ISRCs as in my case all ISRCs matched previous releases.) In my case, most tracks were new purchases and the total cost worked out to the same as buying the entire album normally had I been able to.\nYou should now have access to all tracks specifically from that album instead of just prior releases (if you used method B above for any tracks, and you want them on another device like your iPhone, you can now download them on that device, e.g. at iTunes Store > More > Purchased > Music > [Artist]).\n", "Q: iMessage on Mountain Lion disconnecting AIM and GTalk I'm not sure what the cause is, but I never had this issue until I installed Mountain Lion.  I had the iMessage Beta prior to installing Mountain Lion and I did not uninstall it after.  However, I get disconnected constantly and its been going on and off.  I have a lot of difficulty connecting to AIM, but GTalk is disconnecting frequently.  I am not sure where to start.\n\nA: I have been having this pesky problem as well.  Mine was solved by reseting the password with the provider.\nI found a post that stated that someone solved this by logging into AIM.com website and reseting their password. I tried this and found that since my AIM account was set up through another provider (Apple) that I needed to go to Apple and change my password.  I did this and it resolved my issue.  (I needed to change the Apple password anyway for good security in that I had not changed it in YEARS).\n\nA: My aim account somehow disappeared from ichat. I had to added it as \"other message account\" not AOL. Then under preferences->general, I selected \"all in one list\". Changing the aim password online also helped.

Some more details:\n\n\n*\n\n*I hold the iPad in landscape mode, with the button to the right.\n\n*Holding my finger on one of the icons makes them wiggle.\n\n*I can move all of the icons around\n\n*The one exception is that there seems to be a line in the middle of the screen where I can't move the icon below that line.\n\n\nIt seems to be isolated to the middle of the screen, the area around the middle icon in the third row from the top. I can move that icon up, and to the left and right from there, but I can't move that icon down. There seems to be an invisible line a couple of pixels below its original position that I can't cross, no matter how hard I try. Moving that icon down results in dragging it a couple of pixels, then it moves back to its original position, with my finger still on the screen. It's really weird.\nIn apps like Safari or Paper, I don't have that limitation, scrolling and drawing works fine in all areas of the screen. Anything that requires drag and drop in that area seems to be a problem, e.g. in NodeBeat HD, when I want to move a node, there's the same invisible line that I can't cross.\nAnybody else have that issue or know what might be causing it?\n\nA: OK, I'm somewhat embarrassed, but it looks like the problem fixed itself after a couple of days. After noticing the issue first, it was reproducible for a couple of days. I backed up the iPad to iTunes, did a factory reset as a new device, and the issue was still there.\nAfter that, I called Apple Support and they suggested replacing the device, since it seemed to be a hardware issue. I couldn't replace the iPad at this time since I was travelling, so I told them I would wait another couple of days.\nWhen I was back from traveling, I backed up the device again and called Apple Support to arrange the pickup of the iPad. While on the phone with them, I had to describe the issue again and while doing so, was trying to replicate the issue while talking on the phone. Guess what, it worked this time and has worked now for the last couple of days without any issues.\nI'm not sure how the issue fixed itself, but there are several possible explanations - not sure how reasonable they are, though:\n\n\n*\n\n*The iPad was with me on two atlantic flights (Europe - US and back), maybe the pressure change has fixed the issue, if it was a hardware issue. I remember that the issue was still there when I got to the US, but was gone after I got back.\n\n*Doing another backup/sync with iTunes fixed the issue, which would mean that it was a software issue.\n\n\nThere may be other explanations that I don't see at the moment. While it all is a bit mysterious, I'm glad that it's working now. Let's just hope that it doesn't return.\nUpdate July 2013\nThe problem returned after a couple of weeks. I finally called Apple Support and they exchanged the device for a new one, since mine was still under warranty. The new one works perfectly fine.

Nothing is happening. I googled the problem and was able to get my pictures on to my Mac by using a SD-Card reader. Anyhow, it's not recommended to open the camera every time I want to transfer some pictures and EOS Utility isn't compatible to Mountain Lion. Did anyone come across that problem?\n\nA: Digital cameras are usually not mounted as storage devices. To transfer the photos from the camera, use the Image Capture.app which is under Applications.\nOnce you connect your camera, it'll show up there.\n\nIn the bottom left, see the triangle button. Here you can select whether Image Capture should open automatically once you connect the camera.\n\nA: You need to update your Canon software.

Using the Canon software has ALWAYS been a terrible experience for me. It is painfully slow and convoluted.\nOpening and closing the hatch for the memory card will not damage the camera or memory card unless you are very careless about it. I have done this tens of thousands of times with my cameras and memory cards with no issues at all.\n\nA: I have a Canon 7D & Macbook Pro and have also found this process to be far from seamless. Image Capture doesn't open automatically when connected to Canon SLR' (my 7d or 400d) however it is the best software that I have found for the job. I save the files in an external file structure rather than creating albums and events in iPhoto. \nI have have found the Kingston SD card reader a worthwhile purchase. Image capture has also crashed a few times when uploading so I never delete the imported photos using the software and do it manually on the SLR once the device has been disconnected. \n", "Q: Which adapters serve video out from a first generation MacBook Air?

As a chorus and opera singer, I frequently download public-domain scores in PDF form and read them with my iPad. There is a built-in PDF reader on the iPad, and it is serviceable for music performance. But there are flaws:\n\n\n*\n\n*Some PDF files containing high-resolution scans of the score take a long time to display. The degree of lag is a function of how the PDF file was made. In some scores it seems like the page starts off blurry and comes into focus. \n\n*It's difficult to jump to arbitrary points in the score (e.g. director says, \"let's skip to page 166\", those with books turn easily, I fumble fumble on the iPad)\n\n*It's hard to add bookmarks to PDF files to correspond to rehearsal numbers, to speed up jumping to points in the score.\n\n*There's no way I know of to make annotations on the score during a rehearsal, even an \"x\" to say \"review this later\".\n\n\nA good PDF score-reading app for iPad would fix these problems:\n\n\n*\n\n*App should read ahead in the PDF file, digesting the next couple of pages of the socre, so that when I turn to the next page it appears instantly -- for all PDF files, even those with high-resolution scanned images.\n\n*Easy ways to jump to page numbers and rehearsal numbers quickly, while rehearsing.\n\n*Ways to add bookmarks to scores for rehearsal numbers\n\n*Some way of annotating the score. \n\n*I can think of many features which would make the app even better.\n\n\nCan any of you recommend iPad apps which work well for you as PDF score readers?\n\nA: forScore\nThis is the app I use--it's extremely stable and has a fantastic feature set. Only $5, too. What initially drew me to it was how easy it is to get files into the app--you can download them from a URL, from your Dropbox, upload from iTunes, use a built-in store, take a picture of a physical score with your iPad's camera... There's also a neat feature to share scores with other iPads over Bluetooth--something I've on occasion done with my piano teacher.\nI don't even use all of the many features, but it's an app designed specifically for PDF sheet music reading and performance, so here are some I know off the top of my head:\n\n\n*\n\n*Lots of options for metadata, categorizing, and bookmarking exist.\n\n*Annotations are built-in and very easy to use.\n\n*It's got a handy \"performance mode\" that disables extra functions except for the page turns.\n\n*It can even make use of a Bluetooth foot switch accessory for page turning.\n\n*You can rearrange/duplicate/crop the pages of your PDF so you have a linear set of page turns to deal with cuts, repeats, and codas.\n\n*You can bind page turns to an audio track for rehearsal or performance purposes.\n\n*Built-in metronome and pitch pipe for rehearsal purposes.\n\n", "Q: Notification Center \"Tweet sent\" bird whistle plays through iMac internal speakers instead of selected output device Tweeting through Notification Centre share buttons plays \"Tweet sent\" bird whistle through my iMac's internal speakers.

I am trying to understand the process of switching out my HDD for an SSD and then replacing my optical drive with the same HDD just removed in a late 2011 Macbook Pro 15.4\". \nIs there any benefit to doing this vs. just replacing the optical drive with a new SSD and leaving the HDD where it is at? \nMy main intent in adding a SSD is to increase the speed of my computer and not necessarily adding more space. My HDD is 750GB and I'm not even close to filing it up. I do have programs on my HDD like Microsoft Office that I don't want to lose and don't have the means of reinstalling. \nAny suggestions would be great and a detailed description of how to go about this would also be greatly appreciated.   \n\nA: Have a look - we have quite a few questions covering this - you may want to edit your question to differentiate it from similar questions.\n\n\n*\n\n*Replacing SuperDrive with secondary storage?\n\n*What are some tips for replacing my MacBook Pro hard disk with SSD?\n\n*Recommended MacBook Pro 13 (mid 2012) SSD upgrade?\n\n*Compatible SSD for Macbook Pro (replace HDD)?\n\n*Will a standard MacBook Pro optical-bay HDD caddy fit a non-unibody MacBook Pro?\n\n*Is it worth upgrading my MacBook hard drive to an SSD?\n\n*How to install an Operating System after replacing optical Drive by a second HDD on MacBook white late 2009?\n\n*Are \"generic\" Optical Bay Hard Drive Enclosures for Macbook Pros just as good as Optibay/OWC\n\nA: I've never used these OWC optical drive replacement kits but haven't ever heard anything negative about them; the power draw from the SSD is so much less than a traditional spinning HDD that I doubt you'll notice much difference in battery life.\nSwapping the HDD out is trivial; replacing the optical with any other drive will be a bit more complicated, but do-able.\nIf you decide to only upgrade the HDD to SSD and retain your optical drive, you could use any external 2.5\" SATA to USB enclosure to clone from the HDD to the SSD; I've done this plenty of times.\nIn any case, upgrading to a SSD is a really great performance improvement, especially on an older portable.\n", "Q: Swollen/pregnant battery on a MacBook (13\" aluminium late-2008) The battery in my late-2008 model aluminium 13\" MacBook became extremely swollen in early to mid-2012 after only 283 cycles (as per Cycle count under Hardware → Power), and the button on the multi-touch trackpad stopped working due to the expansion of the battery.  I have since had to remove the battery to get the button working again, but the battery itself hasn't leaked, just expanded very heavily to nearly 1.5× the height (perhaps ≈0.2 each on top and bottom).  After removing it, it's basically nearly impossible to put it back in and still close the cover.\nI'm convinced that this is a fault in Apple's design, because it seemingly started after there were a couple of times that I had a browser open with too many windows, and it busy-looped during the night, getting quite hot and with the fan kicking in.  However, during such occasions, the MacBook itself sat on a rather clear desk in an air-conditioned room, so I find it unacceptable that plain-use self-overheating on the machine's part could possibly cause any such problems.  (I only ever ran OS X on the machine, and it was very far away from any other heat sources or direct sunlight.)\nI'm disappointed that now I not only can't use the MacBook as a portable with any kind of battery life at all, but also that it is now subject to resets during power outages and cannot be transported (e.g. in sleep mode) without having to be shutdown first.\nShouldn't extremely swollen and expanded batteries that completely obstruct trackpad button usage be covered by a warranty?  This never happens with any other single  brand-name manufacturer of computer batteries!  What are my options?  Do I have to buy another battery at full price, only to have it become pregnant and start obstructing my button again right after the warranty is out?  I tried going to an Apple Store in NorCal, and they said they can't do anything about it, since it's out of warranty.  They said that even at 1.5× the width, it is still supposedly safe to use!\nMy perspective here is that the battery has not been consumed, but instead became damaged through no fault of my own.  It was either defective outright (either through design or manufacturing), or it has become damaged through hardware/firmware/software bugs related to charging and/or overheating.  I wouldn't have cared if it simply stopped holding the charge for more than a dozen of minutes or so; that's clearly something that is very well documented everywhere and is to be expected.\n\nA: I run into this as well with our MacBooks after a few years. You have to replace the battery. If you have an Apple Store or Reseller nearby, ask whether there is a replacement program ongoing (there sometimes is) which would allow you to get a new battery cheaper or for free.\nIt would be odd to have a 2008 model Mac still covered under a one year warranty. Even AppleCare with a three year coverage would normally be expired in this case. You might need to spend $129 for a battery at this point, but you could try one more time at a store if you read up on some details.\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.apple.com/batteries/replacements.html\nTowards the bottom it says:\n\nHowever, the AppleCare Protection Plan for notebook computers does not\n  cover batteries that have failed or are exhibiting diminished capacity\n  except when the failure or diminished capacity is the result of a\n  manufacturing defect.\n\nThen you'll want to go to the full AppleCare document, http://www.apple.com/legal/applecare/appgeos.html, where if you search for battery and skip past the iPod parts, will be:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*What is not Covered?\n  4.1 Hardware Service. The Plan does not apply to:\n  (vi) Consumable parts, such as batteries, except in respect of battery coverage under APP for iPod or unless failure has occurred due to a defect in materials and workmanship;\n  \n\nSo, with a battery that is rated at 300 cycles, and is listed as a consumable part (i.e. expected to fail over time), it's pretty common for some people with failed batteries to have to pay for a replacement. Now, the one thing would be if the trackpad still doesn't work after you paid for a battery exchange, I would ask them to consider repairing that.\nKeep in mind - the warranty (or care plan) has a start and end date. During the time of the plan, it's Apple's responsibility to pay for repairs and service and parts for covered repairs. After that time, it's the consumer's responsibility to pay.\nI would head to the genius bar, with an appointment, and ask them to look it over. Explain (briefly) that you were told at another store you had to pay for a battery and feel bad. You clearly wish it had lasted longer and ask if there is any way they could help you avoid paying for either a repair of the trackpad or a replacement of the battery. \nThink of that person as your friend as opposed to someone \"working for the man\" and is there to say no. You might still get a no answer, but at least you read up and can talk with them over what would be covered and what wouldn't be covered. By trying to get a second hearing of your situation, you might either feel better or they might find a way to help and you'll be out a trip to the store and maybe the cost of a battery.\n\nA: Your battery has swollen because its old and has been overcharged, that is, you haven't used it much in four years, and that's what happens as a result. It's constantly being charged from 99%-100% while rarely being discharged. It doesn't matter on the brand of battery, L-ion will react in this way.\n\nA: It's a little challenging to find the question in your situation, but it looks to be this:\n\nShouldn't extremely swollen and expanded batteries that completely obstruct trackpad button usage be covered by a warranty? \n\nYes, and they are so covered.  As it happens, this recently happened to me on a 2010 MacBook Pro that was still under my 3-year warranty, and they replaced it without debate.\nIn your case it sounds like you're really asking if this isn't some defect so severe that they should decide to replace it for free without warranty coverage.  While that would be nice, and I've found Apple to be pretty generous with repairs and replacements on close calls (recently expired warrantees, questions over impact damage vs. failure, etc.), I suspect they're not making such an exception here for a relatively understandable reason:\nA five-year-old laptop battery is generally expected to be useless, and need replacement.\nSo, their view is likely that not only is your computer not under warranty, but that it's not under warranty, and the failed part is one that is expected to have failed by now.\n\nA: Your battery was designed for 300 charge cycles, and you got 283 cycles out of it. Apple aren't going to do much for a battery that has achieved 94% of its expected lifetime. You're correct that if you buy a replacement the same thing will happen again, but not for another 300 (or so) charge cycles. Batteries are consumables and you should treat them as such. If you buy a newer MacBook (2010 onwards), its battery will be rated for 1,000 cycles instead of 300, and then you should be able to expect a better battery life.\n\nA: This is a design / manufacturing defect. Do a search on Apple Macbooks and you'll see they had issued a recall as far back as 2006. They continued to have issues for several years, with Macbooks having swollen or bulging batteries, including exploding batteries. Apple's position in most instances, according to reports, is that after 1 year this is expected behavior. Leaves you with something to think about.\nhttp://appleinsider.com/article/?id=1921%3Fwww.dailytech.com\nSo this DOES answer the original poster's question.\nDo a Google search and you will see numerous complaints, include a full featured article in ZDNet that explains how Apple considers this \"expected behavior.\" Even if the battery swells so much to explode, Apple considers this normal despite this clearly being a manufacturing defect.\nhttp://www.zdnet.com/article/applemacbookbatteryexploded/\nIn some cases Apple has begun to realize what a fiasco this is. Batteries aren't supposed to do this and they have made exceptions. It's hit or miss regarding such a serious manufacturing and design defect.\n\nA: The charge of the battery is monitored by the software and if the software keeps the battery charging after it is full, then the battery will swell.  It's called overcharging.  Apple has tried to update their os and it seems to have worked at least for the newer machines.  If the older machines have updated to the newest os, then the problem should be solved but with that said, the older machines should continue to work if a hole is poked into the battery to release the pressure if there is no problems with the charging system before.  I have poked a hole in my 2012 Macbook Pro and updated to the newest os Yosemite just to be safe.\n", "Q: MP4 object: 10.8 webkit browsers \"Missing Plug-in\", other browsers display video via QuickTime My organization's web site uses object tags to display MP4 video files.

I have all my music on my iPod and while I know how to get the music files off of it, they are encrypted. Is there a way to decrypt my music files to their original names so I can then back them up to my external hard drive?\nCurrently all the file names are seemingly random 4 characters.\nI'm currently using Windows 7.\n\nA: These files are not, in fact, encrypted. The id3 tags are still intact. If you re-add the files to iTunes, the proper names and artists should show up, assuming they were tagged correctly in the first place. \nIf you have \"copy files to iTunes media folder when adding to library\" and \"Keep iTunes Media Folder Organized\" checked in advanced preferences, it should rename the files and put them in folders by artist in your music folder when you add the files to iTunes.\n\nA: I know this was asked long ago, but maybe this will help someone in the future. In 2018 I created a python utility to fix this (it changes any m4a files to mp3 however because that's the only way I could readily read the id3 tags). It also takes all of your songs from into their respective F## (eg. F12, some default storage for the ipod) folders and sorts them by the artist according to the id3 tags.\nIt works in Linux, the utilities probably work for Mac users as well. there's no GUI so you'd have to runthe instructions from a terminal. I hope it helps whoever out there.\nEDIT: I added an executable that allows this to be used on Windows systems (linked in my repo below)\nhttps://github.com/Tclack88/SortMusic\n\n\nA: Turns out there's Senuti for Mac Users (Trial into a Paid Version) and a Free Open Source version for Windows called Sharepod.\nI ended up using Sharepod and it was crazy simple and extremely fast. No BS. I haven't tried Senuti, but that's just what I found.\n\nA: If you're using Windows De-Itunify can sort out the file names easily for you.\nI used it when I took a few thousand songs off my iPod (since the battery stopped working). Had about 50 folders each with about 40 songs with names like FHRK.mp3 in it and this sorted them out into folders by artists with the actual songs name and band in the filename.\n", "Q: Can I disable Mac sleep mode even when lid is closed? \nPossible Duplicate:\nIs there any way to set a MacBook Pro to not sleep when you close the lid? \n\nI have a Macbook Pro (early 2011) with Mountain Lion installed. \nIs there a way to prevent my Mac from going to sleep even on lid close?\n\nA: If you have an external monitor plugged in, it will happen automatically.\nOtherwise, you can use InsomniaX.\n", "Q: Windows will not boot to my boot camp partition on a DIY fusion drive - gives \"No bootable device found\" error I have a MacBookPro 9,1 (mid-2012, non-retina) running OS X 10.8.2.\nHere is what I have done to my system:\n\n\n*\n\n*Installed Windows 7 x64 Pro to a boot camp partition; installed all windows updates.\n\n*Using WinClone, save an image of this boot camp partition.\n\n*Removed optical drive and HDD.\n\n*Installed HDD in place of optical drive.\n\n*Installed SSD in place of HDD.\n\n*Booted to recovery partition, installed OS X on a flash drive.\n\n*Booted to flash drive, created fusion drive using MacWorld's instructions\n\n*Booted to recovery partition on flash drive.\n\n*Restored system to fusion drive from a Time Machine backup.

I followed the instructions here, but that didn't work either.\n\n\nI am now completely at a loss as to how to proceed, and Google isn't much help either.\nIn conclusion, here is some information that you may find helpful:\n$ diskutil list\n/dev/disk0\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *240.1 GB   disk0\n   1:                        EFI                         209.7 MB   disk0s1\n   2:          Apple_CoreStorage                         239.7 GB   disk0s2\n   3:                 Apple_Boot Boot OS X               134.2 MB   disk0s3\n/dev/disk1\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *750.2 GB   disk1\n   1:                        EFI                         209.7 MB   disk1s1\n   2:          Apple_CoreStorage                         648.4 GB   disk1s2\n   3:                 Apple_Boot Boot OS X               650.0 MB   disk1s3\n   4:       Microsoft Basic Data BOOTCAMP                100.9 GB   disk1s4\n/dev/disk2\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:                  Apple_HFS Mayfly                 *884.0 GB   disk2\n\n$ diskutil cs list\nCoreStorage logical volume groups (1 found)\n|\n+-- Logical Volume Group 63DC419F-1A09-4C5B-977A-F59F79502CA1\n   =========================================================\n   Name:         FusionDrive\n   Size:         888087773184 B (888.1 GB)\n   Free Space:   0 B (0 B)\n   |\n   +-< Physical Volume B1B14251-2DB3-491C-9E7A-5C2FD11881BA\n   |   ----------------------------------------------------\n   |   Index:    0\n   |   Disk:     disk0s2\n   |   Status:   Online\n   |   Size:     239713435648 B (239.7 GB)\n   |\n   +-< Physical Volume D0BA2837-514D-4620-8E1D-26D18137CA94\n   |   ----------------------------------------------------\n   |   Index:    1\n   |   Disk:     disk1s2\n   |   Status:   Online\n   |   Size:     648374337536 B (648.4 GB)\n   |\n   +-> Logical Volume Family 736A8900-FE9C-4342-A932-EDC35444774C\n       ----------------------------------------------------------\n       Encryption Status:       Unlocked\n       Encryption Type:         None\n       Conversion Status:       NoConversion\n       Conversion Direction:    -none-\n       Has Encrypted Extents:   No\n       Fully Secure:            No\n       Passphrase Required:     No\n       |\n       +-> Logical Volume B4997853-59F8-4480-BB48-3481B2F2A123\n           ---------------------------------------------------\n           Disk:               disk2\n           Status:             Online\n           Size (Total):       884000030720 B (884.0 GB)\n           Size (Converted):   -none-\n           Revertible:         No\n           LV Name:            Mayfly\n           Volume Name:        Mayfly\n           Content Hint:       Apple_HFS\n\n$  sudo gpt -r -vv show disk1\nPassword:\ngpt show: disk1: mediasize=750156374016; sectorsize=512; blocks=1465149168\ngpt show: disk1: Suspicious MBR at sector 0\ngpt show: disk1: Pri GPT at sector 1\ngpt show: disk1: Sec GPT at sector 1465149167\n      start        size  index  contents\n          0           1         MBR\n          1           1         Pri GPT header\n          2          32         Pri GPT table\n         34           6         \n         40      409600      1  GPT part - C12A7328-F81F-11D2-BA4B-00A0C93EC93B\n     409640  1266356128      2  GPT part - 53746F72-6167-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC\n 1266765768     1269536      3  GPT part - 426F6F74-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC\n 1268035304         280         \n 1268035584   197111808      4  GPT part - EBD0A0A2-B9E5-4433-87C0-68B6B72699C7\n 1465147392        1743         \n 1465149135          32         Sec GPT table\n 1465149167           1         Sec GPT header\n\n$ sudo fdisk /dev/disk1\nDisk: /dev/disk1    geometry: 91201/255/63 [1465149168 sectors]\nSignature: 0xAA55\n         Starting       Ending\n #: id  cyl  hd sec -  cyl  hd sec [     start -       size]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n 1: EE    0   0   2 - 1023 254  63 [         1 - 1268035583] <Unknown ID>\n*2: 07 1023 254  63 - 1023 254  63 [1268035584 -  197111808] HPFS/QNX/AUX\n 3: 00    0   0   0 -    0   0   0 [         0 -          0] unused      \n 4: 00    0   0   0 -    0   0   0 [         0 -          0] unused  \n\n\nA: The issue, it seems, was that the hard drive was in the optical bay. I found claims that Windows was designed not to boot from external drives, and that if you put an HDD in an optical bay and try to boot Windows from it, it will fail.\nI have no idea if this is an accurate statement, but what I do know is this: when I switched my HDD back to its original position and put the SSD in the optical drive bay, Windows started booting again as though nothing had happened. The fusion drive still worked, too.\n\nA: According to what I tested with my Macbook Aluminum, 64GB SSD in the drive bay and 750GB HD in the Optibay: Windows does not install in the Optibay, but it will boot fine from it once it is installed. You may need to use rEFIt to boot to the installation if you cannot just swap the drive.\n", "Q: what are some good apps for backing up all iphone data to dropbox? I'm already using the Dropbox iPhone app, but it only backs up my photos.\nBasically, I'm looking for the iPhone equivalent of the Android \"SanDisk Memory Zone\" app, which automatically and regularly backups my contacts, docs, files, etc to my Dropbox account. https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sandisk.mz&hl=en Preferably, a solution for a non-jailbroken phone.\nCan anyone recommend an app that will backup other data to my Dropbox account?\n\nA: Due to the sandboxing applied to all application in iOS it is not possible to backup \"everything\" to Dropbox. Dropbox access must be enabled by the individual application (as a lot of text editors etc. do) or be based on public APIs (like for Photos).\nIf you are just looking for a way to easily backup everything, iCloud backup would be an option. But you'll need an iPhone to recover any data from there as well.\n\nA: Does PhoneView do what you need?  http://www.ecamm.com/mac/phoneview/\n", "Q: iPad 2 locked by Apple? A relative of mine got an iPad about a year ago and has not updated it until November after he asked me to help him with the update. We had updated it to the most recent iOS possible at that time using his apple account. Later, after the update was completed, he asked me to show him the iCloud. I logged in using my Apple ID to show him exactly what it is and now apparently his iPad is locked for 90 days. Has anyone heard  of anything similar? Is there a fix?\n\nA: I believe this is associated with automatic downloads and/or iTunes Match. See http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4627\n\nOnce a device or computer is associated with your Apple ID, you cannot associate that device or computer with another Apple ID for 90 days.\n\nThis article makes it sound like you can only sign in with a different account every 90 days, but this doesn't seem to be the case in my experience. I regularly sign into different accounts on our family's iPad when downloading apps and this has never been a problem.\nI've only gotten warnings regarding this 90-day lockout when enabling iTunes Match.\nThe article also notes that:\n\nNote: Removing a device from your Apple ID does not override the 90 day timer. The timer must complete 90 days from the day the device was associated before it can be associated to another Apple ID.\n\nIt looks like you'll have to contact Apple if you want to have the device reset.\n\nA: In order that I would try:\n\n\n*\n\n*Contact Apple directly to get them to reset your account.\n\n*Create a new Apple ID and restore the iPad to factory settings.\n\n", "Q: Mirroring iMac through Apple TV iMac (mid 2011) Mac OS X (V 10.7.5) 2nd generation Apple TV - Airplay icon not appearing and not appearing in settings.

I was doing a new Time Machine backup so the issue may be identical, but did not think to actually check whether the sandbox errors were limited to while I was backing up.  If it helps the backup failed.\nI called apple and their recommendation was to restart to the recovery drive and then use the utilities to reset the ACL permissions.  This has now been done and I am back up running Console to check for further errors and yes, I am still getting the same report.  Noticeably this time the sandbox error replicated without Time Machine even running so it appears to be a Microsoft Office issue not directly connected to Time Machine.\nI am sending the new log to apple and will see what they say.\n", "Q: How to disable thumbnails icon preview only for video files in Finder?

I'm offering my Internet to somebody living in another apartment and used an Airport Express to extend my Airport Extreme signal. Since the Aiport Express only extends the \"main\" network, the other person is using the main network whereas I'm using the \"guest\" network myself.\nI recently got an external hard drive and connected it to the Airport Extreme's USB port because I want to use Time Machine to automatically backup my MBA. \nHowever, the hard drive is automatically connecting itself to the \"main\" network. Is there a way for me to access the hard drive through the \"guest\" network instead?\n\nA: The most up-to-date version of AirPort Utility is 6.3.2.\nAccording to this Apple Release Notes of AirPort Utility 6.2, you can extend guest networks as a part of the update.\nThe most current AirPort Utility is 6.3.2, which is available through software update. I however is able to find 6.3.1 in this Apple Release Notes.\nThis will solve your problem easily by letting yourself use the main network, and your neighbor using the extended guest network.\n\nA: I would assume that given the current setup, it can't be done. The guest network is specifically designed to be excluded from the rest of the network. Apple routers, while robust, are not known for their advanced configurability, and while I cannot say for sure,  I'm quite sure this can't be done. \nI'd recommend a cheap non-Apple router that can extend the guest network so that you can use the main network along with all the sharing features of the router.\n\nA: There is a suggestion here that to give guests access to TimeCapsule disks, use the \"Add Wireless Client\" feature : http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3477 \n", "Q: Can't SSH access iPad Once some time ago, I had SSH access to my iPad (3rd generation running iOS 5.1.1) and had changed the root password successfully.

My messages on iMessage won't send. It allows me to type the message and hit the send button but it won't deliver. iMessage is on in settings and I've tried reseting network settings on my recently purchased iPad mini. And I have setup my email on it and so has the person I want to message.\n\nA: Email and iMessages are generally speaking two entirely different things, with a few exceptions on iOS.\nIt is possible that this is because the person you are trying to iMessage either doesn't have an iMessage capable device, or doesn't have it enabled. However, because it will allow you to send, it I think it is more of a configuration question, potentially on their end. \nFirst check to make sure the recipient has access to iMessage as well. Also, verify that you are sending it to their Apple ID email, if they are on an non-cellular device such as an iPad, or iPod Touch. You should also try iMessaging someone else, to test it.\n", "Q: How to restore a backup to a user account? \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow to restore from a Time Machine backup when there is already a user account set up? \n\nWe just sold my wife's MacBook Air, and we're going to try sharing my MacBook Pro for a while. So I set up a new user account for her on my MBP, and I am wondering if it is possible to restore her time machine backup onto her user account without losing all of my stuff.\nIs this possible?\n\nA: You have software that came with your Mac that will allow you to transfer that over.\nFirst you need to delete the new account you created for her. Delete that via users and groups under system preferences.\nOnce that is done log into your account, which I hope is an admin account. Under /Applications/Utilities there is an application called Migration Assistant.\nWith Migration Assistant you can import her Time Machine back-up onto your computer and it'll import her entire back-up into her own user account. Which is why you needed to delete the account you created for her. You need to not have an account on the machine that matches the name of the account that is on the Time Machine backup.\nWhen importing from her back-up you can choose which parts of the back-up to pull in, Applications, Documents etc... you can avoid redudancy if you have any of the same applications on your machine.\nHere is Apple's support article about Migration Assistant.\n", "Q: Best app to edit text in PDF files on OS X? I have tried Wondershare PDF editor to edit text in PDF files; it works but not so well. Is there any other alternative?\n\nA: Honestly, if you can stomach the investment, go with apps from the Adobe suite.

According to their website, it can:\n\nFind empty files and folders, orphaned files, duplicate files, broken aliases, and unused preference files.\n\nThe user interface is a little weird, but it does have the functionality to scan either the entire drive or a particular folder, so I think it'll meet your needs.\nIt costs $39.95, but you can give it a try for 30 days/10 launches for free and see if it works for your situation.\n", "Q: How to turn off iPhone 5 Edge/GPRS?

In the past (iOS5 and earlier) clicking on a link for directions within a website opened the separate maps app and provided directions. How do I force links in websites, that would normally open a google maps link in a \"desktop\" web browser, to open the new external google maps app? I do not find the current google maps website adequate (can't figure out how it would provide dynamic (voice) directions) and the new apple maps app is not opened by those links.\n\nA: As Matthieu Riegler said, when you go to the Google maps site you will be prompted to launch the app. Unfortunately, there is no way to do this automatically.\n\nA: I believe at this point, Google Maps correctly implements deep links. So if you open a maps.google.com link, like this one it'll open directly in Google Maps, if you have it installed. It even works with Google Maps shortlinks, (the ones starting with https://goo.gl/ like this.

Tap Change Store to view this item.\n\nWhen I click Change Store, I get:\n\nCannot connect to iTunes Store\n\nHow come?\n\nA: Your apple ID is registered in the Israeli Store. The application is not available in the Israeli Store, so you cannot switch to the U.S. store. \nTwo items need to happen for an App to be listed in a certain country:\n\n\n*\n\n*The developer of the app (Google in this case) needs to register with Apple to fulfill all the legal and contractual requirements to sell in each country they choose to have a presence for any of their apps to be sold.\n\n*They need to submit and have Apple approve each specific app for each specific country. Most developers push all apps to all eligible stores, but they don't have to choose to do that even though they could opt to do that.\n\n\nLet's leave the speculation on who / what / why to either company (Apple and Google) to address in particular, but we can certainly discuss the mechanics of how the app stores work without getting into opinion and conjecture.\n", "Q: How to prevent Mail creating a local Sent Messages folder I have a Gmail account in Mail.app that behaves a bit weird: whenever I send an email, Mail tells me that it created a local \"Sent Messages\" folder and changed my settings.\nThe sent email messages are correctly saved in the Sent Items on the Gmail server (this is the behavior I want), but they are also saved in this local folder.

I then went into Disk Utility only to find out that it wasn't actually recognising my hard drive..\nI then tried another hard drive from another macbook and it wasn't picking up that hard drive either. \nNOTE: I placed a CD a few weeks ago and it didn't like it, caused the fan to go crazy and I had to remove the CD through a command in terminal.\nI tried cleaning the wire that runs from the Macbook to the hard drive and this picked up the hard drive at boot-up but then when I restarted, it went back to the same old flashing \"?\" mark. \nCould it therefore be the wire that is running from the hard drive to the main-board? If so, would this be expensive to fix (From Apple directly) or would it be cheaper for me to purchase online and fit it myself? \n\nA: Based on the fact that another known-good drive did not work, it sounds like questioning the cable is the next logical step. You could confirm what you already know by installing your hard drive in your friend's computer and booting it, thus proving the Partition Table/Master Boot Record/Apple Partition Map are in working order.\nIt sounds like plenty of other people are having problems with their hard drive cables too. \nYou can always buy an enclosure for your drive and attempt to boot from USB, ultimately proving that there is nothing else it could be. It's a tad cheaper than the replacement part.\nGood luck.\n", "Q: Show only imported files in iTunes I'm new to iTunes and I don't like that it lists all files ever played in the categories \"Songs\" or \"Albums\" for example. I only have a few albums on my mac, but I have listened to a lot of stuff, mostly from external drives. \nMy problem:\nSaying I want to listen to some music, it's pretty hard to find the music which is actually playable, because iTunes shows all files ever played. Is it possible to show only files which I have actually imported, without turning on copy files to iTunes Media?\n\n\nA: You can delete items whose files have been removed by running this from AppleScript Editor:\ntell application \"iTunes\"\n    repeat 5 times\n        repeat with t in file tracks of library playlist 1\n            try\n                if location of t is missing value then delete t\n            end try\n        end repeat\n    end repeat\nend tell\n\nI don't know why you have to run it multiple times, but it usually removes all items after about five times.\n", "Q: How do I resolve duplicate \"in the cloud\" songs in iTunes 11? When I installed iTunes 11, for some reason it re-downloaded all my purchased \"in the cloud\" songs even though they were already in my library.  So now I have duplicate songs, one that matches the cloud, one that has my rating, playcounts, etc.  For example:\n\nI want to tell iTunes that they're the same songs- I tried to delete my old copy then, when it asks me to locate it, point to the new copy, but when I delete the cloud entry it doesn't realize that they're the same.  Is there anything that I can do to fix this?\nNote: I do not have iTunes Match, and this is on a Mac, if that's relevant.\nEdit: Of course I could delete my local copy and download and use the cloud copy, but I want to keep ratings and play/skip counts.\n\nA: Like Harry reported, the problem can be dealt with by disabling \"Show iTunes in the Cloud purchases\". But then you don't see your Cloud-based music if you haven't downloaded everything.\nI found that re-enabling this option seemed to reconnect with Cloud and resolve the duplicates problem without losing any history.\n\nA: Preserve meta data\nDoug's AppleScripts for iTunes hosts a huge list if AppleScripts useful for managing iTunes.

I want to make pictures with the iphone 5 and want the position information (GPS) in it.\nIs it possible to tag pictures without any internet connection?\n\nA: Yes. It does extremely well with geo-tagging photos without an internet connection. The phone simply saves the lat/longitude in the photo file.\nWhat one needs a data connection for is viewing the images on a map - one must download the map to display the pins. \n", "Q: Change Mac OS X Finder sidebar icons I have seen a lot of related questions/answers but it seems that there still isn't a working solution for it. So I have sum up all related info that I found and maybe we can find a solution to it.\nSo one of the way to do it is like in SIMBL's plugin for colored icons (google it) and like its done in Dropbox - inject code at mach_kernel. But I don't like this idea with code injection and it seems that there can be a simpler way with modification of system resources.\nSo all data for sidebar entries is stored in ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.sidebarlists.plist\n(It's binary plist, open it with Xcode/PlistEditPro/etc)\nfavorites -> VolumesList\nicon for entry is defined with a pair of data: Icon and CustomItemProperties -> com.apple.LSSharedFileList.TemplateSystemSelector\nthat mean that it is possible to change Alias to custom for default entries, or adding Icon and CustomItemProperties -> com.apple.LSSharedFileList.TemplateSystemSelector to custom entry with data copied from default entries and it will work.\nYou need to log off -> log in to see changes.\nBut with that you only can change entry image that already is in system. So I looked more detailed to fields Icon and CustomItemProperties -> com.apple.LSSharedFileList.TemplateSystemSelector\nField Icon is hex encoded and decoded it looks like that:\nImgR��4����FBIL��(����������������ћЊщ��H+�����ю≤�€\\��ћCW����     €ю��������€€€€���ю≤�юD�юC�з�^~�^{��@��T�o�o�l�b�a�r�D�o�c�u�m�e�n�t�s�F�o�l�d�e�r�I�c�o�n�.�i�c�n�s����M�a�c�H�D��_System/Library/CoreServices/CoreTypes.bundle/Contents/Resources/ToolbarDocumentsFolderIcon.icns���/�€€\n\n(default Documents field)\nSo it's pointing to normal, colored documents icons file. Changing data for another .icns file (even valid or from another default icon) make entry show default stock folder icon.\nBut if change it to another default icon and then change com.apple.LSSharedFileList.TemplateSystemSelector like in that icon then it will show that another default icon.\ncom.apple.LSSharedFileList.TemplateSystemSelector looks like this:\n1935819875\n\n(default Documents field)\nThis means that Icon data and com.apple.LSSharedFileList.TemplateSystemSelector number are related and pair of them determines entry icon. I'm not figured yet what is this number and what it means, but for default entries it always begins with 19358**. I think it's related to CoreServices.framework header LSSharedFileList.h and it's number of entry in some kind of system resources list.\nIs there someone know what to do next? I would be grateful if you could help me with it.\nHere is list of default entries data http://www.mediafire.com/view/?l5sqalslbcxj2dl \nIt will help you if you want to change your stock folder icons in sidebar to icons from default entries. \n\nA: This isn't an answer but it does add some information.  The value associated with the com.apple.LSSharedFileList.TemplateSystemSelector key, 1935819875, is a decimal representation of the file type.  In hex, it is 0x73624463, which are the ascii letters 'sbDc'.  This file type is described in /System/Library/CoreServices/CoreTypes.bundle/Contents/Info.plist.  This is a binary plist that you can convert to xml using plutil -convert xml1 -o Info.plist.xml Info.plist.  Looking in the Info.plist.xml file, you can see a dictionary at the top level.  Inside this there is a key \"CFBundleDocumentTypes\" and an array of dictionaries as its value.  In this array is a dictionary that contains the following:\n<dict>\n    <key>CFBundleTypeIconFile</key>\n    <string>SidebarDocumentsFolder.icns</string>\n    <key>CFBundleTypeName</key>\n    <string>Sidebar Documents Folder Icon</string>\n    <key>CFBundleTypeOSTypes</key>\n    <array>\n        <string>sbDc</string>\n    </array>\n    <key>CFBundleTypeRole</key>\n    <string>None</string>\n    <key>LSTypeIsPackage</key>\n    <false/>\n    <key>NSPersistentStoreTypeKey</key>\n    <string>Binary</string>\n</dict>\n\nAn interesting key/value pair in this dictionary is CFBundleTypeIconFile: SidebarDocumentsFolder.icns.  This file can be found at /System/Library/CoreServices/CoreTypes.bundle/Contents/Resources/SidebarDocumentsFolder.icns and it contains the icons used for document folders.\nI would think that changing the com.apple.LSSharedFileList.TemplateSystemSelector value to a different value, or updating the dictionary for 'sbDc' to refer to a different icns file would get you on your way to having custom icons.\n\nA: I only understand the zone in which this thread deals the code.

The user believes it was another family member, but would like to have visual proof. \nWhat steps can I take?\n\nA: There are no steps you can take because you don't have access to the server logs at Yahoo!  If this is a legal matter, you might be able to obtain a search warrant for the mail server logs if law enforcement is involved.  This would only prove where the connection was established from, which may or may not be useful.\nIn the meantime, have the owner of the Yahoo! account change their password to something stronger and ensure they don't leave their iPad or any other device logged in where somebody else can access it.\n\nA: The fact that you receive a message from bob@yahoo.com isn't a proof that this message is originating from bob nor yahoo.com.\nFor example alice@wonky.com may send you a message with a header\nsaying From: Bob <bob@yahoo.com>.\nHence it can't be a proof that the bob account was illegally used.\nTo check that a message is really coming from bob@yahoo.com just look at the full headers of the suspect message and check its origin.

When somebody sends me a URL in an email, it is opened by Safari.\nBut often people make a mistake when copying the links (how I do not know) and the URL starts with ttp:// instead of http://.\nIs there a way to teach Safari to feel responsible for ttp URLs as well and open them as http URLs?\n\nA: You can tell Safari to open ttp URLs by adding this to ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.LaunchServices.plist and restarting (logging out and back in isn't enough).\n<dict>\n    <key>LSHandlerRoleAll</key>\n    <string>com.apple.Safari</string>\n    <key>LSHandlerURLScheme</key>\n    <string>ttp</string>\n</dict>\n\nI don't know how to redirect them to http URLs though.\n\nA: The \"http://\" part of a URL defines the protocol to use when connecting to the resource. \"Http\" is reserved for hypertext/web-type stuff. Two ther protocols include \"ftp://\" for file transfers and \"afp://\" is Apple file protocol.\nAsking Safari to assume that \"ttp://\" should mean \"http://\" because someone who professes to know how to use a computer does not understand the significance of failing to select one character when copying and pasting is akin to demanding blind spot monitoring equipment on cars, just because self-professed drivers fail to set their side-view mirrors properly to see into their \"blind spots\".\nWait, near-economy cars now come with nanny equipment! I retract my comments.\n\nA: The short answer is, you can't, and you don't want to. \nEvery page on the web has an address, its URL. If the URL is not accurately input in the browser, the browser can't locate it or connect. \nIf you'd like to learn more: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_resource_locator\nUpdated browsers can usually handle input of just the host name. \nSo Safari can find \"aol.com\" -- but a broken URL, such as omitting the \"h\", is just meaningless text.\nKnowing this, there are easy ways to handle your problem. A long, complex url, you might want to copy and paste into Stickies--add the \"h\" and it will turn into a clickable link.\nAnd perhaps educate your friends as to what a web link, the URL, looks like. If they send you a link that's not broken, it's clickable from the email.\n", "Q: iTunes Match restarts on step 3 when trying to upload files When I add new songs to iTunes and Match needs to upload them (on step 3), it restarts back to step 1. So it gets stuck in an infinite loop by reaching step 3, trying to upload but failing, then resetting back to step 1.\nHow can I fix this? I already tried the simple things like restarting my computer and turning off and on iTunes Match, and deleting and re-adding the songs back to iTunes.\n\nA: I encountered this problem, and it turned out that it was due to my ISP's traffic shaping. Uploading my music was saturating my upload bandwidth, and after about 5 minutes of that, my ISP would cut my connection to Apple's servers for a few minutes, causing step 3 to time out and the whole thing to restart.\nI fixed the problem by setting up bandwidth throttling on my router while I was uploading my library. Setting it to about 80% of my maximum bandwidth worked well.\n", "Q: What is the easiest (fastest) way to get direct link to MP4 video on YouTube? My Mac is rather old and has issues (many dropped frames) with playing YouTube videos in HD on fullscreen, whether in Flash or HTML5. \nHowever, playing them in VLC makes no drops whatsoever, and what is even better, it plays them fluently even remotely, so I don't need to download those videos. All I need to do is open network file in VLC and paste here link to YouTube .mp4 or .flv file. Works like a charm.\nRight now I get links by copying them and letting jDownloader pars YouTube urls. This gives me direct links to all available formats and sizes. Here I pick one I prefer, copy url and paste it to VLC.\nIs there any faster way to parse those urls without the need of 3rd app like jDownloader? I tried some Safari plugins but none of them gave desirable results to me.\n\nA: I don't think it's much faster.

The actual translation function is great - you can use Word Reference or any of several other sites as your dictionary.  Word Reference is an extremely extensive dictionary. The PDF reading function leaves a lot to be desired though - it lacks a bookmark, so when I stop reading and go back later I always have to find my page again. Hopefully they will fix this.\nUntil then a better solution is Marvin, another ereader app. You can set this up to use Google translate following these instructions:\nhttp://ebookfriendly.com/custom-translation-marvin-book-reader/\nI just started using Marvin but it seems pretty good.

And from experience,  \"video\" seems to offer better playback with bigger files sizes. But I've never properly learned the technical differences between Mac OS's default codecs and I was wondering if anyone could shed some light on this?\n\nA: Most of these codecs you can read more into by doing Google Searches on them. I will try to summarize some of this for you:\nVideo codec is the traditional QuickTime codec used by Apple, going back a very long time. The quality is good, but it takes up a lot of space as it uses relatively little compression.\nH.263 was developed for use in early web applications. Flash and RealVideo were two very popular web delivery mechanisms that utilized this system. It essentially is an update to the MPEG-2 encoding frameworks used on DVDs.\nH.264 is an update to H.263 and offers even more space efficiency based on the quality. The overall concept of this codec (as well as many others) is to provide a full frame every x number of frames, and in the intermediate frames, to simply record the changes that have occurred from the previous frame. So if you have a frame of a person walking with a still background, only the data of that person's movements are recorded.\nDV - PAL is a format optimized for outputting onto DV (digital video) tape, and PAL means it is designed for the European standard (vs. NTSC which is the broadcast standard in the United States).\nAnimation is a format, similar to H.263, but optimized for animation footage, where there will be many areas of the solid color. It also supports an alpha (or transparency) channel, which allows footage encoded in this method to be layered over other footage.\n", "Q: Where is the error message for a failed podcast download? I am running iTunes 11 on Mountain Lion, and I am subscribed to several podcasts.

If I copy the URL from the episode and paste it into a browser, I can download the file so I don't know why iTunes is failing. Is there a way to see an error message? I looked in Console and did not see anything.\n\nA: Yes, when you are downloading episodes in iTunes 11, this icon shows up:\n\nClick it and you can open your download progress:\n\nIf downloading fails, an error message will show up to the right of the status bar with an error code. You can Google this code for info. In my experience, this downloader is very unreliable if you have anything else downloading at the same time, or if you allow simultaneous downloads, although if you allow simultaneous downloads it generally finishes quicker if there are no errors.\n", "Q: iPhone 4 stuck in recovery loop I have what seems to be a common problem with iPhones (mine is an iPhone 4), a recovery loop, so I try to restore it but now I get this error: \n\n\"Unable to restore iPhone.

My MagSafe 2 cable for my 2012 MacBook Air stopped working.  Took it into Apple store where I had bought my MacBook Air, and sure enough it was the excessive cat chew marks that had degraded it*.  Can some old pros give me some advice on whether or not I should bite the bullet and pay $80.00 at the Apple store for a new one, or are there 3rd party alternatives that work reasonably well?  I have already been told that I might as well get a 85 watt cable in case I get a MacBook Pro in the future (That is a possibility!).\nOn a very related note, are the power cables repairable?  I don't have much sodering knowledge, but I work in a place that does.  Is it straight forward?  Perhaps for the price of a beer I could solve the problem.\n*Money for repairs will be coming out of the cat's allowance!  I have also bought some spray that supposedly puts cats off chewing.  Hopefully that will work out...\n\nA: The Apple cables appear to be designed to safely melt without starting a fire in cases where the internal insulation breaks down in case of crushing, slicing, piercing (kittens are even worse than cats in this regard) or simply worn out due to repetitive bending in the same spot.\nI've seen people decide to use cords when lightly damaged - sealing the cable with electrical tape. Since the voltage is low on the MagSafe side of the cord, this is more a heat/fire risk than a shock risk. The MagSafe board on the Mac usually protects your hardware from any sort of short - and it also is replaceable if it's fusing blows.\nI have on rare occasion seen some nice third party adapters that work with MagSafe connections - but none yet on MagSafe 2. I have seen far, far more dangerous adapters than safe ones.\nThe worst part of counterfeit adapters is that they typically carry the same \"safety\" markings as a quality electronics adapter. Also, some have high quality plastics and similar weight so you may have to be very observant to tell a good knockoff from a genuine part. Unless you are using the adapter in an environment where a small fire could reasonably be contained without undue risk to finances or life, you might avoid using a third party adapter if you are not skilled at evaluating electronics for build quality. \n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.righto.com/2015/11/macbook-charger-teardown-surprising.html?m=1\nThe article above explains how the Apple charger is engineered with a processor in the MagSafe connector and a main processor that's equivalent to the original Macintosh - you're getting a computer inside every Apple charger as well as dense and highly safe design shown on the left and a knockoff design on the right.\n\nI've been well served by buying Apple adapters in terms of reliability and safety, despite the higher cost. I know many that have had good luck with quality third party adapters, but wanted to explain the why some third party adapters are dangerous to use and not even close to equivalent to Apple's product.\n\nA: My 2¢: Purchase OEM.\nApple's chargers (along with everything else, it may seem) are remarkably expensive, but of anything, from what I have seen, there is a reason for it. When it comes to the life-blood of the computer, charging it with something that could potentially harm the entire system is quite a risk. It would be sad to save ~$40 only to have $1000+ worth of equipment fail for some reason.\nUnrelated iPhone charger review (but maybe related):\nwww.phonearena.com\niFixit message post:\nwww.ifixit.com/what-kind-of-charger\nNeither of those links are very impressive, but you may find what at least some people think about Apple's chargers interesting.\nFor the new charger (either OEM or third party), I wouldn't worry too much about the higher wattage, unless the price is almost exactly the same, or the higher wattage unit is more available. If you purchase a Macbook Pro, it will come with a power cable as well.\n\nA: Its probably not your cat. I blamed someones dog for my first cable failure, but with repeated failures, I learned that its just the rubber getting cut open by metal shielding wires poking out due to fatigue failure. The cables are simply poorly designed; the rubber is too flexible, putting a strain on the metal its never going to be able to cope with.\nBuilding adaptors isn't rocket science, and my half-priced knockoff works just fine. But if you don't trust them, nor want to reward apple with another $80 for poor design; you can buy magsafe replacement cords on ebay, and attaching a new cord only requires a little bit of soldering. If that doesn't faze you, its the cheapest option.\n\nA: Having read all the posts and knowing as much as I know about Apple power supply circuits, I would prefer to build my own power supply.\nApple power circuits are at best on the weak end of the spectrum and apart from being super innovative in proprietary protection are fairly basic and low end. It is all relative nonetheless. If one's benchmark is fake Hong Kong, Taiwan or China power supplies (The likes of Bestec, etc), then Apple power devices are much preferred. \nHowever, neither the efficiency, neither, the stability, nor the reliability of Apple power supplies is anything to look at with admiration. Yes, the cable is designed to melt when short circuited, so is a plain fuse, and more intelligent power supplies have short circuit protection in addition to a fuse as a contingency against a general failure. Even the most basic power supplies have thermal protection, which is present in an Apple adaptor but it is pushed to the limit so that other elements may fail before it is activated. \nApple power adapters and accessories are a case of point in economics, like OEM spare parts on a car. No replaceable 50c fuse is there but replaceable $80 adaptor. Why trigger thermal protection before general failure? Because it is suboptimal economics. \nApple, can use top of the line power supplies with modular cables, however, sales of high margin accessories will decline and about 20% of market cap will be axed. \nA user can build their own power supply, which even with the balance of risks is far more attractive. \nThink of the intellectual capital that you will build by creating something far more perfect than the fat executive bonus and and outrageous return on capital behind the pretenses of innovative designs. This pragmatism and not ideology.  \nIn fact, one adds a lot more value to the global economy by improving faulty designs (Bill Gates will probably agree) than labor, supplier and service provider arbitrage. \nCase in point was Apple's founder and despite his anger at Google, his approach and philosophy was never to take impossibilities for granted. \nUnless for some insane reason I opt in to believe the OEM marketing fluff, I am far from convinced that I should not build my own power adaptor to replace the intentionally flawed OEM device! My approach has a lot of risk, but if successful it's return increases with each subsequent Apple device that I own. \nSomething that Apple can no longer be indifferent to and maybe realize that such a symbiotic outcome may actually be on par with the high margin but subpar accessories sold, and refocus the company on innovation, not rent seeking from tied products!\n\nA: Apple doesn't license the MagSafe connector so any 3rd party adapters will be illegal knockoffs, which if they cause other problems with your laptop, those will not be covered by Apple.  I would strongly recommend you just buy an Apple adapter.\nWhile possible your coworkers could fix it, it won't be easy for them.  It is more than just a simple power cable.  It has many wires for communication between the laptop and the power adapter brick.\n\nA: It's not worth trying to repair the damaged adapter, even if you manage to find someone skilled enough to repair a damaged cable its very likely to fail later. Buy a new one from Apple or even better locate a local authorised Apple service provider.\n\nA: I just fixed the cables that our kittens chewed on a Magsafe 2 adapter. The chewing was in the middle of the cable and took some time to cleanly cut the cable and open the wires about 3/4\" long on each side and twisted them together. Applied the electrical tape and my Macbook Pro Retina started to charge again. There is nothing special about it, but to be careful in cutting just the plastic portion and trim the inside plastic with a sharp knife. \nThis is a lesson to all pet owners to keep the cables far away from pets.\nThey also chewed couple more cables - iPhone USB charger, Panasonic Cordless telephone charger - I fixed them all. The iPhone USB charger - it ain't worth as it takes longer to fix it and wires are too thin.\n\nA: I had a adapter that was beheaded internally and would rotate 360° and obviously not work. I went to a Apple store trying to get a \"their fault free recall replacement\" as this one was newer than all my other ones. they told me they could swap it with a factory refurbished one for $45-50 or I could buy a new one for $80.\n so what you think I did?\nI bought a new one, the old one went onto my workbench and I Almost repaired it but broke the connector trying to get it apart. it went into a box, i moved, gathered some money ($15?) and ordered the replacement cable off of eBay.\nand now for $95 I have a travel and home adapter.\nthe hardest part is actually opening the adapter although that can also be avoided if you don't mind doing a splice.\nthe biggest problem with Apple products is the cable they use, from Dock cables to lightning cables to MagSafe cables to iBook power adapters. they all have the same flaw, they are weak and wear out sooner so you have to buy a new one.\nthere is a GOOD reason why you don't find that style wire on your table lamp, in fact most twin lead zip cord is double insulated in countries with 250V AC to prevent the wires from fraying and shorting out or coming in contact with humans.\nBut somehow because it is DC it's perfectly acceptable.\nand it's not just Apple, I see the same problem on HP and Dell power adapters although the wire is a little bit better quality. and it doesn't stop there, 9V power supply for guitar pedals..... ( I got that last one for free because the original owner rather get a new one.) however the manufacturer change the wire style from coaxial to twin lead. I guess they learned their lesson and improve their product?? !!shocked face!! )\nat least with the Apple adapter there is no \"power adapter sense wire\" as the circuitry is in the end, whereas HP and Dell have a 3 wire cord which has its own host of problems.\n", "Q: Lion Boot from a Flash Drive Mac So I'm trying to load a Lion DMG onto a 16GB flash drive according to this tutorial, but I only get as far as step 9. The data starts to restore to the flash drive, but right as it gets to the end, when it's only initializing, it gives me the following error: \nWhat do I do?\n\nA: If you have not tried it yet the free Lion Disk Maker can create a bootable USB drive from the .app.\n\nA: If the goal is to have a USB drive that you can take to a place and install Lion, you could just install Lion onto the USB drive. Run the Install Mac OS X installer and let it format the drive, install everything and then when you create your admin account on that OS, you can copy that InstallEDS.dmg (or better the whole Lion Installer program) onto the drive.\nThen, you can boot any Mac holding the option key to get into the Startup Manager and insert the USB drive. \nOnce that Mac boots (and it will be slow since writing and reading to a USB drive is orders of magnitude slower than a modern HDD), you can run the installer against the internal drive of your Mac that is currently booted from the USB drive.\nSorry it's not a direct answer - so you could use this if no other answer appeals to you and solved your direct problem of getting InstallESD.dmg contents as a bootable image itself.\n", "Q: OS X license on used Mac? I just got off a very long and very frustrating phone call with Apple support.\nI purchased a used Apple computer which came installed with Mountain Lion. Meaning that the computer was shipped by Apple with Mountain Lion installed, and received by me with that same installation.\nAs a precaution, I tried to reinstall Mountain Lion via Recovery mode. This failed because my Apple ID hasn't purchased Mountain Lion.\nApple insisted that because I didn't purchase the computer new, I don't have a license for OS X. I don't believe this is correct, or even legal. This means that anyone using a used computer is doing so illegally, unless they've purchased a separate OS license.\nAm I way off-base here? I'm pretty sure I now \"own\" a copy of Mountain Lion, and Apple is in the wrong. If this is correct, what are my options?\n\nA: The agent should get low feedback. The license to Mountain Lion transfers with the computer when it is sold. \nThe agent should have told you that no Apple ID is needed to download another copy of the installer since the system prompts you to send the serial number for verification. \nNow, you don't get a license to the Mountan Lion upgrade to install on other computers. That is software you purchase separately from a computer and that is tied to one Apple ID and is not transferable. (like everything else sold from the App Store) \nThe one case where you don't get Mountain Lion is if the machine shipped from the factory with Lion but was sold with a \"free upgrade\" to Mountain Lion. This could happen in the window between when they announce the new OS to when it's released or on Mac that are imaged in the factory before Mountain Lion was released, but sold after the release. \nIn that case, Apple have a free redemption of the upgrade to the first Apple ID to redeem it. The only license that would transfer would be Lion and not Mountain Lion. \n\nA: My experience was not as bmike said. I just erased my MBA SSD and selected the Reinstall OS X option in preparation to sell the MBA.  I have several Apple ID's and I picked one that had never purchased Lion. It would not permit the download of the OS for reinstall.  So I switched to an Apple ID that had purchased Lion for a older computer and it was allowed to download. But the fact is, this computer came with Lion pre-installed and I should not need to have purchased Lion separately in reinstall it.  Bad Apple!  Fix this!\n\nA: Often OS licenses are not transferable.  You would have to read the EULA to be sure.\nThe OS that came with the system is most likely what would be allowed.  Did the previous owner give you any system disks?  Any upgrades they purchased wouldn't be transferable since you can't transfer purchases between AppleIDs.\nMost likely you will need to purchase Mountain Lion under your AppleID then you will be able to install it on your new system.\nHow much is your time and frustration worth?  Mountain Lion is only $20 and it will be usable on all your computers.\n\nA: bmike's comment is very useful to know. I have a slight variation on the question. If I buy a second hand Mac Mini Server, there seems to be no problem doing an Internet install of the version of OS X that came with it (Mountain Lion). However, as a server, it would originally have had the OS X Server app.\nI have just had a conversation with Apple Support about this. They said the Server app is licensed to the original owner and does not go with the machine. This seems inconsistent.\nIs the app installed as the machine arrives, or do you have to download it from the App Store? For the latter case, I can see it would be licensed to the Apple ID used to download it. If it was on the machine in the box, it should be able to be transferred with the OS licence.\n", "Q: Sidebar icons from non-system volume disappears after restart in Finder of Mac OSX 10.8.2 I dragged folders in finder to Favorite in sidebar.

Thanks.\n\nA: If the disk/share isn't mounted, the favorite is removed from the sidebar.  If you want to keep favorites to network shares, removable disks, or files in disk images, there is a workaround.\nCreate a new folder named \"Remote Favorites\".  This can be anywhere on your local disk (Home folder, Documents, etc)\nDrag the Remote Favorites folder to your sidebar\nAdd aliases of the remote file/folder into the Remote Favorites folder.  (hold option+command while dragging the source file)\nThe Remote Favorites folder is local so it won't disappear from your Sidebar.\nNow when you need to get to one of these remote files, open the Remote Favorites folder and double click the alias of the remote file.\nAnother benefit of using aliases is that if the network share or disk image isn't mounted, it will automatically mount it first.\n", "Q: I created a 'Image from Folder\" using Disk Utility, with Encryption and Files are Invisible I'm in a little over my head.

I'm guessing I also can't delete these either.\nThe files are there, can be seen via the Terminal, but they are invisible.  Maybe because of attribute properties on the prefix of each file?   Each file starts with a \"-rw-r--r--@\".  \nIs chmod possible to adjust the attributes/?  Can anyone help with the right line entries.\nIs there anything else I can do?\nThanks in advance for any help.\nkd\n\nA: The 'Image from Folder' will use the existing ownership/permissions of the folder and files.\nFirst off, is the disk image a read/write image?  Are you able to add new files to it?  If not, the instructions below won't work if it is read-only.\nThe permissions you've listed, \"-rw-r--r--@\", mean that the file is read and writable by the owner and readable by everyone else.  The @ at the end means there are extended attributes to the file, which might include some kind of invisibility option.  You would have to get a directory listing with -@ to show the attribute keys.\nFor example, here is a listing showing an image that I manually set to be hidden.\n$ ls -l@\n-rw-r--r--@ 1 insom  staff  - 64832 Dec  6 18:56 FunnyImage.png\n    com.apple.FinderInfo       32\n\nIf all your files also have a com.apple.FinderInfo attribute, use Terminal to change into the directory of the files and run the following command to unhide the files.\nchflags nohidden *\n\nNow, if your dir listing doesn't show the com.apple.FinderInfo attribute then they are not being hidden using this method but something else is going on.\nHave you tried rebooting?

But I can't get this to display at that resolution just 1920x1080.\nI discussed this with a couple of Mac Genius guys at the Apple store. They didn't think it would do this resolution so I took them to the Apple page that says it will do this resolution via HDMI on the Mini. They suggested that I bring in my Mini and display into the store.\nJust wondering do you have to have two displays before OS X displays one monitor at 1920x1200? \n\nA: The Mac Mini can do 1920x1200 but it is probably the HDMI to DVI adapter doing the limiting.  The Mac will only display the resolutions that it is being told it supports by the connected device.\nIf you are trying to get the display to 1080p HDTV, it is doing it properly (HDTV is 1920x1080).\nIf you are trying to get to 1920x1200 for a different monitor with a DVI connector, it probably won't be able to, again due to the limit of the adapter.\nThe monitor can probably do the 1920x1200 but it can't communicate that to the Mac because the adapter is in the way, which is saying it can only do 1920x1080.\nBy chance does your display have other connection options, like DisplayPort or MiniDisplayPort?  You can get an HDMI to Display Port adapter which will allow the display and Mac to communicate properly. \n", "Q: applepushserviced and ocspd takes a lot of memory, is killing them safe? I'm in my office and the the network access is limited, would this causing this two process taking too much memory?\nI use my Mac mainly for developing, would it be safe to kill this two process?\n\nA: The OS handles unneeded processes automatically by swapping them out to disk while they are not running. You won't get significant amounts of memory back by killing them.\nIn addition at least ocspd is started automatically by OS X if needed. So even if you kill it, it will be started again as soon as Safari (or any other app) needs to verify certificates.\n\nA: Try opening Activity Monitor and keeping an eye on CPU cycles to see what's chewing up RAM, which is a big slowdown.  \n\nA: I regularly need to kill applepushserviced. I am guessing about why that process goes bad every few days, but I am within a corporate firewall and forced to use draconian proxies. It drives that process crazy for some reason.

[...]\n\nhttp://www.apple.com/ios/ios7/business/\n\nA: For iOS 6 and previous, when you issue an app purchased from VPP to a device - it becomes permanently tied to the Apple ID just like gifting an app burns a redemption code once it gets redeemed. Apple has publicly announced that VPP codes will be able to be reclaimed and reused indefinitely by the \"purchaser\" so this will likely be a pain of the past once iOS 7 ships.\nHere is the marketing pitch from http://www.apple.com/ios/ios7/business/ under the App Store license management heading:\n\nThe App Store Volume Purchase Program now offers businesses the\n  ability to assign apps to their users while keeping full ownership and\n  control over app licenses.

I have a mid 2009 MBP. I am going to install Boot Camp beside Snow Leopard.\nI would like to have a third partition, DATA, and format it FAT32, where I will keep my data files easily and safely accessible by both Snow Leopard and Win7 on boot camp partition. \nDoes anyone knows the easiest procedure that I should follow to create this third partition? should I create it before/while/after installing Boot Camp?\nThanks\n\nA: Solution 1:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shrink the Mac partition.\n\n*Create TWO partitions in the remaining space.\n\n*Set up windows in one.\n\n*Set up data in the other.\n\n\nWhile I have not run the windows 7/8 installs, the older versions would present an interface to use an existing partition if present.  If not present, it would default to using the entire remainder of the disk, but this could be over-ridden.  So you may have an option in an ordinary install to not use the entire remainder of the disk.\nSolution 2:\nUse an external drive as your Data drive.  Using a cloud drive such as DropBox, or Google Drive is also a possibility.\nOpinion warning:\nI'm not a fan of multi-boot.  The stuff you need to do is always in the OS that isn't running.  Many sad tales of installation processes that were unkind to foreign OSs.  Now that both Parallels and Virtual Box have reasonable performance, I consider that for most uses, a virtual machine is a better solution. \nSo...\nSolution 3.\nRun windows in a virtual machine, and either export a file system via Samba (SMB) or by the virtual environment's file sharing system.  This alternative can be expanded to allow DOS VMs Linux VMs, Solaris VMs.  Note that screen handling can be kludgy for any OS that doesn't have the appropriate extensions.\nSolution 4. \nRun Windows on a separate box and connect to it via Remote Desktop.  Again, clunky.  But I know guys who use their iPad this way to connect to their windows box at work.  Not sure how much serious work they get done this way, but fetching the power point presentation they left at work may be sufficient.\nSolution 5.\nRun windows on a machine next to your Mac so that you can spin your chair.\n\nBootcamp makes the most sense if you actually need to use the same hardware at maximum performance.  But unless you are needing access to massive amounts of data from both OSs an external hard drive or even an 8 Gb thumb drive is likely addequate.\nIf performance isn't as critical, then running in a VM gives you access to both environments, and the additional security of having a mac beteen your windows box and the cruel world.  (Yes macs can be pawned, but it now means that an attacker has to get through 2 OSs defences.)\nThe Remote Desktop solutions require a reasonably high speed data link.  \nThe 2nd computer solution is less than ideal for portability. \nHope this helps.\n\nA: It can be done if you get your mind outside OSX-BootCamp box mentality.\n\n\n*\n\n*On new formatted HDD install fresh your OS X, install what you may need in it.\n\n*Via boot camp create a second partition for W7 or W8, create your installation with apple drivers using an external USB flash drive and your iso image of W7 or/and W8.\n3.Shrink to a clearly defined size your Mac OS X partition 100-200Gb.\n4.Obtain Acronis True Image software ISO 2014 - burn it on CD or DVD or Blue-ray in W7 or W8 via Windows image burner. If your mac doesn't have DVD drive you have 2 options - external usb one or use a special software to burn that image on usb flash drive {xbootvs1.0beta14 will do it just fine}.\n\n*Download the new iso of Linux Ubuntu and \"burn\" it on a usb flash drive - in Windows can be easily done with Universal-USB-Installer-1.9.xx or the iso of GPARTED 16.x - use the same technique.\n\n*Since you have already an NTFS partition you can boot from Acronis optical media or usb flash drive pressing ALT key. Navigate, create a *.tib backup of your Mac OS X partition on your NTFS partiton [split image in 700Mb size pieces to be compatible with FAT32 volumes]. Reboot, copy your created image on external HDD, better formatted in FAT 32.\n\n*Reboot in Linux or GPARTED, copy your hidden Recovery HD partition to an empty external HDD;  erase your entire HDD, change it to MBR from GPT; create new partitions:\n\n\n*\n\n*1st for Mac OS X - the size you shrank it before, assign FAT 32 file system,\n\n*then the second W7 partition i.e. 100Gb NTFS,\n\n*then I did third W8 partition 100 Gb NTFS,\n\n*then the rest will be an extended partition.\n\n*Inside that extended partition you can have several partitions :\n\n*I have first logical partition 50 Gb in ext4 file system for Linux Ubuntu,\n\n*then second logical NTFS partition for data,\n\n*then HD Recovery HFS+ Journ partition from original Mac OS X – you can copy it back now from your external HDD.\n\n\n*Reboot in Acronis, restore your OSX from your external HDD backup.\n\n*Reboot in OS X and install rFFIt and your favorite driver for NTFS - open source or Paragon NTFS for Mac OS X so you can see and write into NTFS partitions. Also you can install Paragon extfs  for mac to be able to see Linux partition. You can also disable journaling in OS X from command line if you want Linux to see and write into Mac OS X partition.\n9.Install W7 from your media rebooting and holding ALT on second partition, install the bootcamp drivers, install MediaFour  Mac Drive for Windows to write into HFS+J Mac OS X partition or Paragon HFS for Windows.  Install Paragon ext fs  for free to be able to write into Linux partition from Windows. \n10.Install W8 from your media rebooting and holding ALT on third partition, install the bootcamp drivers, install MediaFour MacDrive for Windows to write into HFS+J Mac OS X partition or Paragon HFS for Windows.  Install Paragon ext fs for free to be able to write into Linux partition from Windows. \n\n*Install your Linux Mint or Ubuntu into fourth logical partition. Install support for HFS and other file systems.\n\n*On consequent bootings  in  OS X rEFIt will graphically display the choices  for  your  OS types – with logos of Apple,  Windows or Penguin’s  logo of Linux.\n\n*OS X boots  directly. Other  OS systems  are bundled in GRUB loader from Linux,  which you should edit with Grub customizer utility from inside Linux. Thus  when you press the second choice the Linux penguin appears  your previously edited GRUB options.  From there Linux boots directly.\n\n*When choosing windows from partition 2 once again you have your GRUB loader with those 3 choices – thus  rename  them correctly i.e. W 7 64 bit and W 8  64  bit. When you choose once again W7 it loads the Windows Boot loader of W7 with 2 choices Windows 7 and Windows  8 – choose once again W7 since if you choose W8 it will reboot.\n\n*When choosing Windows from partition 3 once again you have your GRUB loader with those 3 choices – thus  rename  them correctly i.e. W 7 64 bit and W 8  64  bit. When you choose once again W8 it loads the Windows Boot loader of W8 with 2 choices Windows 7 and Windows  8 – choose once again W8 since if you choose W7 it will reboot.\n\n*Conclusion:  to have 4 working OS, plus data partition {plus your Recovery HD} you need to have MBR type of HDD since Windows 7 and Windows 8 cannot see more than 4 primary partitions on GPT original Mac HDD system due to lack of specific Unified Extensible Firmware Interface support instead of BIOS, while your MacBook has a special Firmware emulating  only a rudimentary BIOS  for your Windows when you do not use directly bootcamp to install and use it. On your new MBR HDD all OS-es can see more logical partitions  inside extended fourth partition of HDD. Also Linux can be installed on a logical partition inside extended one, while OS X and any of Windows 7 or 8 need only primary partitions.\n\n\nA: Here is the complete step by step detailed article to achieve 2 windows partitions - http://macosxtricks.blogspot.com\n\nA: Probably after you use BootCamp to partition and set up Windows, you can boot into Disk Utility from the Snow Leopard DVD, shrink either the Windows or main Mac HD partition, and then make a new partition. But without personal experience trying that I can't guarantee it won't mess up BootCamp or your OS, so it'd be important to back up everything in case you need to reinstall OS X and restore from Time Machine (or a Disk Utility-generated image backup).\n", "Q: App store charging twice for same app In Decemeber 2010 I purchased Goodreader for iPad, was emailed this statement:\nGoodReader for iPad, v3.1.2, Developer: Yuri Selukoff (4+) \n£0.59\n\nI installed Goodreader on a new iPad just a few days ago.\nI was notified I'd been charged again for it:\nGoodReader for iPad, v3.18.6 (4+) \n YURI SELUKOFF   App    £2.99\n\nI don't understand why and it's hard to find any definitive info about this (aside from forum posts).\nWhat could be to blame?

There are av, aux and usb inputs in the front of the amplifier. How do I connect the 2 devices to play music wirelessly without AirPlay?\n\nA: Just buy 2 of this (or somthing doing the same job). It will transform any speaker to bluetooth speakers, so you will be able to connect any bluetooth using device to your speakers and get the sound wirelessly. You should buy one for each device you want to connect. You then can connect the two bluetooth adapter using this (not sure what it is called). If your aux uses RSA, you can find the equivalent for RCA connections.\n\nA: If you don't mind about quality and cost, you can have a pair of wireless a/v transmitter and receiver.

I'm not sure if it was something adding during an update by the carrier (AT&T) or one of the iOS updates.\nA person on another forum mentioned noticing it ever since the iPhone 3GS. Based on my research so far, it appears that it's inconsistent.\n\nA: If you wanted to be extremely precise, one might say that the tone you hear isn't necessarily a low battery alert tone, but it is a tone to let you know an urgent notification has arrived. (i.e. any alert would sound identical at that point)\nTwo events that cause these alerts that are audible when you are on a phone call are the low battery alerts that iOS issues.\nMost people would just say the tone is for a low battery warning, though. :-)\n", "Q: Which App saves and restores window size/position on relaunch of an app? Is there an app that saves (when I quit the application) and restores the window size and position of an application the next time I start it?\nI found apps like Optimal-Layout, Breeze and Simple Window-Sets but all of these apps only give the option to save states for specific apps or globally.\nWhat I would need is an app that saves the size and position of a window by its title.\nFor example:\nI use iTap mobile RDP quite often. The application starts up with a little window showing the bookmarks I've created. Once I double-click on one of the bookmarked sessions the actual RemoteDesktop window appears. But the application always opens it at the upper left corner of my main monitor. I have to move the window to the second monitor every time I open a RemoteDesktop session. I've seen the same behavior for a lots of apps.\nI would like to have an app that recognizes the title of the window and moves it to the position where I closed it the last time.\nI would also like to avoid manually clicking something in the menu-bar or keyboard shortcut to restore a windows position. It should be some kind of \"Window Watcher\" which checks a windows title when its created and restores the position and size.\nDoes anyone know an app like this?\n\nA: Ask the developer of iTap mobile RDP to add that as a feature.

I can copy files from/to the disk at will. However, I want to move a file that is about 6GB to the disk. To my surprise, an error message appears saying that the file is too large for the volume's format !!\nNow I know I have 50GB left on the disk, so can someone tell me a way that can just force the file into the disk and ignore the warning message ?\n\nA: If the USB stick is formatted as FAT32, the maximum file size is limited to 4,294,967,295 bytes (~4 GB). This limit is a consequence of the file length entry in the directory table and would also affect huge FAT32 partitions with a sufficient sector size.\nIf so, try to format USB thumb with exFAT it will increase the maximum file size to 16 EiB :)\n\nA: The only point to add to xalexownzx's answer regards the partition style.\nFor compatibility with Windows, all FAT32 partitions are MS-DOS style. \nUse the Mac OS Extended (Journaled) format if you don't care about accessing the drive from a Windows machine. \nIf you might want to be able to boot a Mac sometime in the future with this drive without having to reformat it again you will need to format it with a GUID partition map. You can select this with the options button in Disk Utility.\n\nA: In your case, the problem is the file system on the drive as opposed to how it is connected to your Mac. \nThe drive is most likely formatted as FAT32 system. This is a typical partitioning format that is supported by practically all computers (windows, linux and mac os). FAT32 limits file sizes to 4GB and device sizes to 2TB (or 16 TB for 4 KB sectors). For you to be able to store a file greater than 4GB in size, you'd need to reformat the drive to either ExFAT (file size is limited to 16EB, or 16 BILLION TB) or a MacOS partition format (called HFS plus, file size limited to 8EB, or 8 BILLION TB). I'd recommend the MacOS partition format for it's reliability, but only if you're working in a strictly Mac OS environment. HFS plus is NOT supported by Windows. If you need to transfer files between computers of various OSs, I'd recommend ExFAT.\nNote: Changing partition formats WILL DELETE ALL DATA ON THE DRIVE, so make sure you back up all the data on the drive before you start.\n\n\n*\n\n*Back up all your files on the USB drive onto a secure location on your Mac.\n\n*Open Disk Utility by searching it in spot light or opening it from /Applications/Utilities\n\n*Select your desired drive on the left side.\n\n*Go to the \"Erase\" tab.\n\n*Choose your desired partition format from the drop down menu, and name your drive as you please.\n\n*Click \"erase\"\n\n*Restore the files back to the drive.\n\n", "Q: How can I make a folder and its contents automatically owned by two people? Ok, in the /Users/Shared/ folder I have my DropBox folder.\nI have read/write permissions set for me and my wife (shared computer).  However, if she creates a folder/file in the DropBox folder, I can see it but I have to type in my password to delete or edit it.  And she has to do the same if I create something.\nHow can I make it so that if she creates a file/folder in the DropBox folder, we both automatically are the owners?  It doesn't seem to me that the Shared folder does a very good job of, well, SHARING.  Even though I have set both of our accounts as read/write on Shared and all contents.\nThis is driving me insane.  \nThanks.\n\nA: You can solve this problem using group permissions. What you want is to have a file mode creation mask set such that group read, write, and execute permissions are automatically set for each file when a file is created. This can be accomplished using the umask command inside your startup script such as ~/.bash_profile. To set rw permissions on all files, rwx on all directories, that you both create, use\n# Set the umask such that user and group can read, write, and execute.\numask u=rwx,g=rwx,o=\n\nFurthermore, you may want to set everything in the Dropbox to have at a minimum rw group permissions for files and rwx permissions for folders. You can accomplish this using\nchmod -R g+r,g+w /Users/Shared\n\nfor files and use\nchmod -R g+x /Users/Shared/FOLDER\n\nfor folders. You can view the existing permissions in the terminal using\nls -l /Users/Shared\n\nwhere the rwx permissions are arranged in order of owner, group, and other.\n\nA: OS X has two main levels of file-level credential control:\n\n\n*\n\n*users\n\n*groups\n\n\nRight now, it sounds like your wife has \"ownership\" of the dropbox folder, much to your frustration.\nTo rectify this, you will want to use the Users and Groups preference panel to either \n\n\n*\n\n*(if everyone who uses the computer can have access to the dropbox folder) proceed to the last step, using the everyone access control group.\n\n*(if you have multiple people using the computer, but only you and your wife can have access to the dropbox folder) create a new group, perhaps called Dropbox, and  add you and your wife's accounts to this group.\n\n*(if both you and your wife understand the power of being Administrator, and both you and your wife would be the only Administrator on this computer) add both your and your wife's account to the Administers group.\n\n*Set the permissions on the Dropbox folder to give full control to this group from 1 through 3.\n\n*\n\n*In Finder, select the Dropbox folder and press CMD-I (Get Info). \n\n*You might need to unlock the panel if you see the locked padlock in the lower right corner. Click on the Lockard provide an Administrator password.\n\n*In the Permissions section (towards the bottom)\n\n*\n\n*if you see the group already in the list, set the permission to Read and Write\n\n*if you don't see your group in the list, click the + button on the groups side, select and add your group and set it to Read and Write\n\n\n*Be sure to set the drop list at the very bottom to Apply to enclosed items BEFORE you close the Get Info tab.\n\n\n\nChoose wisely, but this process will eliminate your having to authenticate every time you want to use Dropbox.\n\nA: I think that batter solution for that will be installing on other computer another instance of dropbox app? You can use your same credentials or other (with sharing enabled within dropbox site). \nIt will enable other computer to access files when your computer will be sleep/off.  \n", "Q: Unable to install Windows via Bootcamp without superdrive (mountain lion) I have iMac (mid 2011) with latest OSX (10.8.2). Seems impossible to install windows without superdrive (it just doesn't work works fine on windows).\nI have googled for solution but none of them worked. I tried bootcamp method, but when it restarts failed to find USB boot and tries to boot from bootcamp partition, which results no bootable drive found.\nI am not sure if this is OSX restriction by apple, but All I know that I cant install it. If someone have any idea how to fake it or how to bypass this please let me know.\nEDIT:\nIT's all about installing windows 7 dual boot on iMac without DVD. I have edited plist file so I am able to Create Boot USB from bootcamp. When I click Install in boot camp, it creates partition as it should but when Mac restarts it wont boot from USB.\nEdit 2: I have tried with refit, I can see my USB but when I want to boot from it it shows No bootable device error. I have created USB with both Basecamp option and Microsoft official USB creator. None of the worked.\n\nA: It Doesnt work, I managed to do it with better CD and somehow it read it. Also when you do restart after bootcamp completes and ask to restart, don't hold option key, it will find it automatically where to boot from. Holding option and trying to boot from BOOTCAMP volume it doesn't work.\n\nA: Have you tried virtualbox? It's an opensource virtualization tool. I've been using it on linux desktops and works pretty much the same as VMware.\nhttp://www.virtualbox.org\nhttp://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/4.2.16/VirtualBox-4.2.16-86992-OSX.dmg\n", "Q: Determining which contacts use Facetime In either the iOS app or the Mac app for Facetime, you are given the option of selecting any contact listed in the corresponding device's Contacts app, regardless of whether they are capable of using Facetime (they own an iPhone or a Mac with the app). Are there any methods of determining this besides manually keeping a register of it or guessing?\n\nA: To get around this I have added the letters FT to a contacts last name eg \"Surname FT\"  then all I need to do is search for  \"FT\" and there I have a list in alphabetical order of all contacts I can FaceTime!\nSo, create a new message, add all contacts, take note of which ones are blue, and add FT to the end of their surname eg. \"Surname FT\".  Now when you want to FaceTime someone Type FT into the search bar and presto! You have your list. Hope this is helpful, enjoy :-)\n\nA: Unfortunately, the Contacts and FaceTime apps won't display a list of FaceTime-capable contacts, I think you need to just keep a record. You can try doing FaceTime with someone, and if they don't have an Apple device, it will just say that they're not available for FaceTime.\nHowever, if you have FaceTimed with someone, then in my experience FaceTime will (sometimes?) show a camera icon next to their phone number or email address after you click their name.\nAlso, if you open Messages and start typing in a message to someone, the name at top should be highlighted in blue if they are iMessage-capable, and if that's the case, there's a pretty good chance they can FaceTime too, with the iPhone 3GS being the main exception as it doesn't have a front camera but can be iMessage compatible.\n", "Q: Apple powerbook G4 17\" Trying to install Linux I believe followed the directions on how to create a bootable USB drive from the Ubuntu website. My question is how can I get my Powerbook to boot from the USB drive? I tried doing the command+control+o+f and it just shows me the file icon with the question mark I also tried booting it holding the option button and it directs me to a screen with two buttons a refresh and a next button, I click on the next button and nothing happens?? kinda stumped.\n\nA: I am pretty sure the Powerbooks don't boot from USB drives. You'll need to burn a CD.\nI'm going to assume that you downloaded Ubuntu from the homepage at Ubuntu.com, which will give you ISOs for Intel (x86 and x64) processors. Since your computer has a PowerPC processor, you will need to download that ISO: Ubuntu's wiki for installing on PowerPC\nEdit - Someone on the Ubuntu forums says you should be sure to download the livecd version and set arguments for loading the kernel:\n\nBe sure to down load the powerpc live disk. 8.04.1 will give you the least trouble with booting. On my Ibook I have to press the tab key as the first words come up as it begins to boot. This takes you to a screen with some options to load the kernel. The one that works for me is \"linux-nosplash-powerpc\".\n\n", "Q: macbook pro randomly going to sleep I have a early 2011 macbook pro with mountain lion 10.8.2 installed in it, I have sleepawake

the Mouse was there it obeyed the command.\n\nA: I had this exact same problem and it completely befuddled me for a WHILE. Apps to force it to stay awake, like (I assume) caffeine had no effect. Finally while looking at the logs, I saw that what was happening was not that it was going into sleep but rather that it was going into clamshell mode, meaning it was doing what it was supposed to do when one closes the Macbook. I took it into the Apple store since it was under warranty and told them all of this and sure enough it was a problem with the magnetic sensor in the case that detects whether or not the clamshell is closed. \nThey were able to test it quickly without needing to open the case with the use of a magnet that they waved over the case. \nI'm sure you could test for it this way yourself but if you don't want to go see Apple (which I actually suggest that you DO because you're going to need a new sensor anyways) you should check the logs to see what's actually happening when it is doing this. It sounds to me very much like this is probably what is going on and if you check the logs you'll know for SURE; if it says it's going into clamshell mode then it's the sensor and it simply needs replaced.\nReplacing the sensor solved the problem completely. \nIf it is not going into clamshell mode then I do not know what to tell you except that at least it didn't hurt to take a look at the log, right? \nMBP Mid 2009 thinks the lid is closed permanently - this is a link to someone who had the same problem; they posted their logs if you wanted to see what the log will say.\nHope this helps. \n\nA: I have the same issue. I even installed Caffeine, and it still would go to sleep randomly. Screen \"goes black\" while I'm using the Macbook Pro early 2009 with OS X 10.8 with present day updates. If I touch the trackpad while the screen is black I hear some noises like the computer is waking up again and it comes back on. Randomly, could be minutes, seconds, or hours it happens again, sometimes several times in a row.\nPRAM reset and SMC reset did nothing as well, I even reinstalled OS X and it was doing it during the install, tried the hardware test, everything passed but it was even doing it during the hardware test.\nIt never happened until I updated to 10.8.\nSomeone mentioned typing this in the terminal and resetting the computer\nsudo rm /private/var/vm/sleepimage\n\nI'm going to try that and hopefully it works.\n", "Q: Why is it important to keep lots of freespace on OSX? What is the impact? I have a 500GB drive and have less than 50 GB free.  Console is reporting several interesting errors saying I'm too low on space and it's cleaning up \"stuff\"\n\n1/6/13 4:49:51.475 PM com.apple.mtmd[452]: attempting to thin because of low free space on Macintosh HD (/) by removing 2013-01-06 15:50:13 -0500, estimate 0 bytes to recover, 1 snapshot can be thinned\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Why should I have sufficient free space on my drive?\n\n*Since I have a large drive, does it mean I need 10% of a 50 GB drive free? (that's a lot)\n\n*Now that I'm low on space, what is the system deleting and fixing that it doesn't do normally?\n\n\nA: OS X has several built in tools that suspend themselves when space is low. iOS has a far more evolved system where space is much more precious, and over time, those mechanisms are finding their way into OS X as well:\n\n\n*\n\n*General HFS+ optimization on spinning HD such as delayed allocation, pre-allocation and on the fly defragmentation of files\n\n*local Time Machine snapshots (10.7 and later)\n\n*Photos database (10.10 and later) can \"reoptimize\" and reduce storage when you run low.\n\n*Cached files in ~/Library/Caches and /Library/Caches will probably get harvested under the correct storage pressure (no space for swap for instance). Look for iTunes music cached files, iCloud synced files\n\n\nIn the case of very large swings in storage, look first at Time Machine trying to thin the local backups when storage runs low past the \"warning\" level. Once those messages are logged to /var/log/system.log the time machine daemons will be more aggressive about pruning old backups, but not suspending local backups entirely.\nHot file optimization is where small files that are read from or written to often get tiered to the fastest portion of a spinning hard drive.\nKeeping a little free space (I believe mtmd thinning begins at 20% of the volume) means you can have a longer range of local Time Machine snapshots to protect you from deleting a file or erasing some work without needing to connect an actual Time Machine drive to recover that file.\nWith more free space on the drive, the other optimizations can make your drive work faster, so it's more a performance issue when you get less than 10 or 5 GB of free space since the system has less flexibility in optimizing for speed and has to just write a file where there is room as opposed to where it would best be kept to minimize file fragmentation.\nYou can also run the periodic cleanup scripts to see if rotating log files and pruning files in the various /tmp directories help in emergency cases. I've even gone so far as cleaning cached files after quitting the apps to get temporary reprieve to let a critical task finish or get a good backup of files before restarting the system to recover from the manual deletion.\nMy experience is you don't really see significant slow downs until you get to less than 15 GB of space - and sometimes not even until you get into the 5 GB of free space. In fact, these caching designs speed up the OS and help \nwith recovering files (in the case of Time Machine local backups). Running benchmarks can tell that drives start to slow down once you get them 30% full - so SSD are far more level in performance due to the lack of rotational time delays and head seek delays. They also have some overhead to allow a full drive to still have room to juggle delete and write operations since they address storage in larger chunks than the typical block size of an I/O.\n\nA: You need to keep some space free for OS X's use (temporary files, virtual memory swap files, etc), and it's also good to have free space to avoid file fragmentation (if the disk is mostly full, the system is more likely to have to break a file up to fit it in the available nooks and crannies). However, 50GB free should be plenty; for these purposes it doesn't matter much how big the drive is, just how much space is free.\nThe message you're seeing in Console is a bit different. It comes from the mobile time machine daemon (mtmd); this is what takes \"local snapshots\" -- essentially, it backs up within the local drive when your external backup target isn't available. Local snapshots are considered to be a low-priority use of disk space, so mtmd will erase them if the disk gets more than 80% full (and erase them even faster if it gets above 90%). Because of this, if you show the available disk space in Finder, it counts that used for local snapshots as free; if you want to see what's really going on, look in System Information (Apple menu > About This Mac -> More Info button -> Storage tab).\nSo if you want your system to keep local snapshots, you need to keep more than 20% of the drive free. But frankly, if you're concerned about backups you really should concentrate on connecting to the real backup target as often as possible, and not worry too much about local snapshots.\n", "Q: What software can rip high quality audio from a DVD? (losslessly if possible) In Mountain Lion, how do I rip only the audio from a DVD as losslessly as possible?  I have several concert DVDs that I would like to listen to on my iPod.  I have an extensive music library, which is mostly ripped from my own CDs in Apple Lossless format, so my best-case scenario is getting lossless audio off of the DVDs and converting it to ALAC.  \nI realize that the audio tracks on DVDs might already be lossy if they're in AC3 format, but PCM is lossless.  If there is PCM audio on the DVD, then I want to rip that from the DVD and convert that to ALAC.  If there is AC3 audio on the DVD, then I want to rip that from the DVD and pretend that I'm not annoyed by a lossy resampling in the conversion of AC3 (which I can't listen to on any device that I own) to AAC (or something else).\nI know that Handbrake is great for ripping video, but its FAQ says that it doesn't do audio only.  AudioHijackPro will record the audio, so that's introducing an unnecessary layer of loss if the audio is PCM, and I'm not sure if resampling an AC3-to-AAC is less lossy than recording an AC3 track into MP3.\nI'm willing to deal with a convoluted workflow to achieve my goal.\n\nA: MPEG Streamclip can do this. It has options to extract the audio track under the File->Demux menu. You may need apples MPEG2 QT components.\n\nA: MacX DVD Ripper Pro by Digiarty has a free trial of its paid software available for download, allowing you to achieve what you desire. From time to time they also have a limited time giveaway of their products, which may include this in the near future.\n", "Q: How can I move the newstand app into a folder? \nPossible Duplicate:\nCan I put Newsstand into a folder? \n\nHow can I create a folder for the pre-installed apps that come on my ipad that I don't use?\n\nA: You can't.

Check for a firmware update via Airport Utility. \nAdditionally, you can force Windows to release the DHCP lease on its IP address by going in to the Windows command prompt and typing \nC:\\Users\\myusername> ipconfig /release\n\nJust do that before you restart into Mac OS X.

Besides, torrents require a fair amount of processing of the data, lots of network traffic and HD activity.\nYour best bet is to use the Energy Saver panel in System Preferences to get the screen and  computer to sleep after short period of time. You can also check the HD option.\nNot sure about uTorrent but Transmission lets you prevent computer sleep when there are active transfers, and you can set limits on when to stop the transfer. So, you can have it set to seed a certain amount after it's finished downloading, then remove it automatically, and your computer will then sleep.\nAs for measuring power, something like this is what you need:\nhttp://www.amazon.com/P3-International-P4400-Electricity-Monitor/dp/B00009MDBU\nPlug the iMac into it and it'll tell you the actual power used. There are a bunch of similar devices, but the Kill-A-Watt ones are pretty well known and widely  used.\n\nA: There's not that much you can do apart from turning the display off. Either wait for it to turn off automatically or press ⌃⇧⏏.\nYou could also open Activity Monitor and check if any processes are using CPU, but most of them are usually close to idle.\nNew iMacs use about 15-20W of power when they are idle and the display is turned off. The average energy consumption might be closer to 20-25W, but that's still just about 0.002-0.004 USD or EUR per hour.\n\nA: For iMac user without Apple's keyboard for any reason. Use this command to just turn off the display.\npmset displaysleepnow\n\nYou can alias it to a shorter version in your favorite shell profile like ~/.bash_profile\nalias displayoff=\"pmset displaysleepnow\"\n\n", "Q: How do I get Time Machine to work during Power Nap I tested Power Nap on my MacBook Pro Retina (Aug 2012) and my Time Machine backup hasn't made any progress.  Even the hard drive light is out while the machine sleeps.\nEnergy saver is at the default setting of sleep after 15 minutes and Enable Power Nap is checked.\nIt just doesn't seem to work.  Are my expectations wrong?  Shouldn't it just back up while in \"sleep\" mode?  \nThis is a newly re-installed OS with no special apps installed and no custom software besides MS Office.\nUpdate:  My Mac is plugged into a Thunderbolt monitor (power and TB).  The drive is chained off the monitor.  Backups don't occur if the drive is directly connected (no monitor) nor through the monitor.  The laptop is always plugged in.\n\nA: According to the Apple support doc, using Time Machine to back up in Power Nap requires the laptop to be plugged in:\n\nWhen your portable Mac is connected to a power source, it also downloads software updates, makes backups with Time Machine, performs Spotlight indexing, and can continue Mac App Store downloads.  It also updates Help Center.\n\n", "Q: How to manage my own reviews and ratings in Mac App Store? Is there such an option in Mac App Store?

I have an older iMac, without a true retina display. I want to be able to scale the user interface like the retina macs do, but I can't seem to find a way to do that.\n\nDoes anyone know a way to trick the computer into thinking it has a retina display, so the options are available in the Display PrefPane? That, or some utility that might let me access those settings.\nNote, I'm not really talking about HiDPI mode, I've done that, it only has the option of pixel doubling. I want the variable scaling that is available on true retina displays.\nI'm running mountain lion on a 2.5 GHz i5 iMac, about 1.5 years old.\nEdit 9 years later:\nThis question seems to confuse people into thinking it's about screen resolution, but it's only about interface scaling. I'm pretty convinced by now it's not easily possible, but answers talking about resolution are missing the point.\n\nA: I don't see how this would be possible, its a hardware limitation.\nThe 15in Retina comes with a resolution of: 2880x1800 but the resolution is set to 1440x900 by default and has its pixels doubled.\nThat is why when you do doubling of pixels you get a smaller resolution because there is only so many pixels on the screen in which everything can be displayed.\nThe Retina mac's scale the UI by removing the pixel doubling. The screen it self has a high densit of pixels, meaning that a particular window can take up a smaller area by filling in those pixels.\nHowever with a 1080p there are far fewer pixels/lower density and it is not physically possible to scale things to fit.\nTheoretically it is possible but would require real time rendering of everything which would take time + processor usage. As compared to the Retina which has a hardware solution.\nIt is not the best explanation but I hope it delivers the point.\n--EDIT\nUI is designed based on pixels, so a button is placed on a form and it dimensioned to take up say 100 pixels wide and 20 pixels high.\nOn a lower resolution screen it will look much bigger because of the density of pixels, as compared to a higher resolution\nwhere the user has the option to allow the UI to take up single pixels so its small or more than 1 pixel so it looks big.\nSo with that 100 x 20 pixel button, on a 19in screen: At a resolution of 100 x 20 it would take up the whole screen because there are\nonly 100 pixels for the UI to be able to fill up horizontally and 20 vertically.\nIf you had a higher resolution screen the UI is able to take up less space because of the higher pixel density. So the same monitor with a resolution of 400 x 80 will have the button take up a quarter of the screen, and if you allow it to double its pixel then the button will take up 200 x 40 pixels, looking bigger but better/more crisp because of the extra pixels.\nThat is why higher resolution screens have smaller UI, because the pixels are super close together and theres a lot of them allowing us to decide how we want it scaled, ie. how many pixels we allow for each designed pixel.\nWhen Developers design UI they set anchors on everything, that is why when you change the size of the form it dynamically adjust the size of the buttons, boxes etc. \nWhen I say hardware rendering I mean the pixels are placed per pixels or simply multiplied by the current ratio. So at full resolution 1 pixel is 1 pixel on the screen. At a different resolution 1 pixel might be allocated 2 pixels.\n\nA: This article https://www.portableone.com/Tech-News/Enabling-Retina-mode-on-non-Retina-displays-here-s-how shows how to enable 2x DPI scaling on non retina displays. Just execute this from the terminal and restart:\nsudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.windowserver.plist DisplayResolutionEnabled -bool true\n\nAfter restarting a new HiDPI resolution is available in the preferences:\n\nConfirmed to work on macOS Monterey.\n\nA: No, its missing the requisite hardware support.\n\nA: In the Displays System Preference pane, non-Retina displays will still offer at least one scaled resolution.\n\nThere's a \"Show All Resolutions\" checkbox which shows other sizes. (Alt-clicking on the \"Scaled\" button would also reveal more choices on some OS versions.) Apps such as SwitchRes may be able to show even more.\nHowever, of course, scaling a non-Retina display is just going to make everything very large, with the related reduction of 'actual' Desktop real-estate.\n\nA: It's impossible to do it natively. But if you're still interested to do it via a third party app, you could use resolutionator and turn on the \"silly resolutions\" in the settings.\nThe reason that Apple didn't implement this function for non-retina models is because that text would not be readable anymore using these resolution. Retina displays have high DPI (pixel density pixel/inch^2). Retina display doubled the pixel count both horizontally and vertically, which means 4 times of the non-retina pixel count. Now say you want to display a 1500x1500 image, it might look big in the non-retina display but it would look tiny on the Retina display due to the high resolution (in fact everything is 2 times smaller) - and that's why Apple doubled all UI elements in size, rendering what you see on the display the same size of the non-retina ones while still being sharper. What you're asking, the \"more space\" option, is merely an option from Apple to opt out from the UI element up-scaling.\n\nA: AFAIK the entire OS X UI is actually fully scalable. Much like how pdfs function. If that is true, it should be possible (theoretically) to enable Retina scaling on any display.\nI'd actually like that feature as well on my 25\" QHD monitor.\n", "Q: Why proxPN cannot connect on my MacBook?

I am specifically looking for an analogue of Robocopy that will copy files from a directory on a Windows file server, and retry any files that fail.  \nI'm happy using either a GUI or command line.\n\nA: You could use the SAMBA protocol (or Apple's implementation of it), to connect to a Windows Share.\nEither open Finder and choose \"Go\" -> \"Connect to Server\" in the menu bar.\n \nNow connect to your share(s) using the SMB:// as protocol definition. If activated it will ask you for authentication afterwards. Then the share will be mounted like any other mount point.\nOr you could use the terminal to mount the file system using the \nmount_smbf\n\ncommand.\nAfter you've mounted the Windows Share you should be able to use any command line tool or GUI software do to your copying. Instead of robocopy you could use rsync for example (which is built in and pretty powerful). \nOne note: Just remember that saving files directly from within apps on a share could cause some troubles if they are using Apples's Versions feature, which is not supported by FAT or NTFS file systems.\n", "Q: How I can unminimize windows from an application using a key combination? Coming from the Windows world, I was initially used to using Cmd-Tab to switch between open windows. On OS X this switches between applications, so I had to learn to use Ctrl-` to switch between windows in an application. However, even this doesn't seem to switch to minimized windows and (for better or worse) I am in the habit of minimizing windows. The only way I have found to unminimize them is to long-click on the icon in the dock and select the window I want, which is annoying. Is there a key combination I can use which will switch between windows and unminimize them at the same time, or any related keys which would help?\nI am using OS X 10.8.\n\nA: Take a look at tip #10 on http://www.macworld.com/article/2048857/10-tips-for-managing-minimized-windows.html -- that did it for me.\nEssentially, you use ⌘ Cmd+Tab/~ as usual, and for minimized windows, hold down the ⌥ Opt key before releasing the ⌘ Cmd key, and the application opens as you last minimized it.\n\nA: If you want to unminimize ALL windows (not just from one application), you can create the following Automator service and assign it a hot key.\nIn Automator, create new service\nGive it one action: Run Shell Script\nThe shell script is this:\nkillall -HUP Dock\nThis will kill the Dock process (which will then respawn), in the process liberating all windows that have been minimized into the Dock.\n\nSave the service, then use System Preferences to assign a shortcut key to the service.\n\nA: I'm from the same boat;\nthe best native keyboard-only  I've found is\n\n\n*\n\n*CTRL-DOWN-Arrow; (you enter app expose)\n\n*DOWN-arrow; (if there are any minimized windows, this'll put a cursor on one)\n\n*LEFT-arrow/RIGHT-arrow (to select from multiple minimized windows) or hold OPT if you want all of them restored.\n\n*RETURN\n\nalternative step1: getting into app expose before you've alt-cmd'ed to an app:\nwith CMD still held down, (the task switcher is visible)\ntap DOWN, or UP, or 1 (now in app expose)\n\nThe above shows only one app's minimized windows at a time; for selecting from any minimized window regardless of app, CTRL-F3 moves focus to the dock, and you can arrow left to get to the minimized list.\nif your CTRL-F3 instead shows you the app-expose, try FN-CTRL-F3. (In my settings/keyboard, I've flagged \"Use all F1, F2, etc. keys as standard function keys\")\n\nSome apps have specific alternatives; I use Terminal's CMD-window_number, which unminimizes and focuses that window.\n\nA: Witch includes minimized windows by default. You can also assign shortcuts for showing only minimized windows and unminimizing windows.\n\nYou could also assign a shortcut to a script like this:\ntell application (path to frontmost application as text)\n    try\n        set miniaturized of windows to false -- most applications\n    end try\n    try\n        set collapsed of windows to false -- at least Finder\n    end try\nend tell\n\nIf minimizing windows to application icons is not enabled, this clicks the icon for the last minimized window in the Dock:\ntry\n    tell application \"System Events\" to tell process \"Dock\"\n        click (last UI element of list 1 where role description is \"minimized window dock item\")\n    end tell\nend try\n\n", "Q: Bootcamp: is there an advantage of 64-bit vs 32-bit Windows?

If you run the workflow twice, it will fail the second time, because the counter resets and it tries to start the numbering at 1. So if you already have an item named Scan 2013-01-07 01.pdf, it tries to make another named that and fails.\nThe workaround is to use a script to do the renaming for you, which can detect if there are already duplicate files and start over.\nIn place of the Make Sequential action, add a Run Shell Script action, with the shell set to /usr/bin/python, the input to as arguments, and paste in this script:\n#!/usr/bin/python\n\nimport sys\nimport os\n\ndecimalPadding = 2 # pad to x decimal places\nreturnFiles = ''\n\nfor filePath in sys.argv[1:]:\n    pathNoExt, extension = os.path.splitext(filePath)\n    counter = 1\n    newPath = pathNoExt + ' %0*d' % (decimalPadding, counter) + extension\n\n    #     Increment counter until we find a file that does not exist\n    while os.path.exists(newPath):\n        counter += 1\n        newPath = pathNoExt + ' %0*d' % (decimalPadding, counter) + extension\n    os.rename(filePath, newPath)\n    returnFiles += newPath + '\\n'\n\nprint returnFiles #pass the renamed files for other automator actions\n\nThat should get you the results you desire.\n", "Q: How to pinpoint cause of disk I/O errors I am getting (seemingly random) disk I/O errors on my bootdrive.

Mail.app had deemed it Junk and put it in the Junk folder (which I don't believe is accessible from iOS devices with typical IMAP email set up on them).\nThis is what my Junk Mail preferences look like when this happened:\n\nIs there a way to tell Mail.app that a certain sender (preferably something such as \"all senders from @example.com are not junk\" vs. the actual xyz@example.com) is not Junk without actually putting the sender into my contacts?\n\n* I now use AirMail because Apple Mail was using a lot of disk space (among other reasons).\n\nA: Yes — by selecting \"Perform custom actions\" and then clicking \"Advanced,\" you can configure Mail's internal rule that determines both what is considered junk mail and what Mail should do with it. Add a condition to this rule that reads \"From does not contain @example.com\", and no such mail will be considered junk.\nAs far as I know, this is the only mail rule that can determine whether something is marked as junk or not.

I do have a linux machine (Ubuntu) which has no filters and a client machine which is behind a firewall that have even web traffic filtering.\nI can properly establish SSH connections from the client to the server.\nWhat is the correct command line for establishing a tunnel which would allow unfiltered browsing (via socks proxy) and also P2P traffic.\nCurrently I used something like this, but it seems not to work with P2P (uTorrent in my case):\nssh -v -v -N -p 22 -g -C -c 3des user@server.tld -D 0.0.0.0:1080 -R 55555:localhost:55555\n\n\nThe socks5 proxy part works, at least with Firefox but uTorrent is not able to download.\n\nA: Transmission will likely try to connect to the tracker using UDP which cannot be transmitted through the SSH proxy. You may or may not be able to force uTorrent to only use TCP. Even then it's unlikely that this will work.\nAlso this setup doesn't really make a lot of sense. You'd be much better off by downloading/seeding your torrents directly on that Linux box. rtorrent or transmission-daemon comes to mind as a viable solution.\nYou do have a lot of redundant options in your ssh command. You can strip it down to ssh -NC user@server.tld -D 1080 though I'd suggest you put all the config info into ~/.ssh/config anyway. You may increase the security of your connection by only binding your SOCKS proxy to the loopback by using -D localhost:1080. You do not need the reverse tunnel for your question and may even be substantially violating a company policy with that.\n", "Q: I have an encrypted disk. How do I customize the Guest shell that is offered when I boot? I have an encrypted disk and when I boot I'm offered the ability to log in as a guest and get a Safari only shell.  This appears to be different from the guest account that is offered in the login screen on most non encrypted macs\nI'd like to add additional things to that account that will assist me in recovering the laptop in case it is lost or stolen.\nHow can I customize this safari only guest account?\n\nA: You can't in a reasonable way. The OS X native guest account is wiped after each use. You may be better off using a separate user account and limiting that using parental-controls.\nKeep in mind that this will require that user to be able to decrypt the hard drive with their password. So this can only be of benefit if your laptop is stolen while in sleep mode (where the decryption password is already in RAM).\nYour best bet is enabling “Find my Mac” which will activate if the guest connects to the Internet (source).\n", "Q: Can I download updates for another computer?

I have a laptop, however, with access to better internet. \nIs it possible for me to access the updates on my laptop, download them, and then move them over to my Mac Pro and install them? If so, how?\n\nA: A lot of software updates (particularly OS, driver and firmware updates) can be found on Apple's Support Downloads page. You can download them like any other file and just transfer them to your Mac Pro at your convenience.\nFor software on the Mac App Store (including bundled apps like iPhoto), there aren't separate downloads. You could try downloading the full apps on your MacBook then copying the application bundle over.\nFor third party software, there are often separate patches available for download from the developer's site.\n", "Q: Keynote '09 can't play slideshow again unless restarted I am running Keynote '09 (5.0) on Mac OS X 10.6.8 on a mid-2010 MacBook Pro.

This happens to other slideshows I've made, too.\nHow should I troubleshoot this problem???? I have to make a major/high-stakes presentation in a couple days and can't afford any hiccups.\nThanks for your help.\n\nA: The only solution I found so far (by experimentation and searching the web) is to set the display mode to mirroring instead of presenting on a separate display.

The only way I know that I have disk I/O errors is that I sometimes look through all the messages in the Console.app out of curiosity. Of course this does not give me real time information.\nTherefore I want to receive a notification when the following message occurs in the Console:\n07/01/2013 20:59:06 kernel  disk0s1: I/O error.\n\nIs this somehow possible? It's OK if this means that Console has to be on all the time.\nI'm on Snow Leopard 10.6.8.\n\nA: I would not use Console.app.  Instead use Terminal.app with the following command:\ntail -f /var/log/system.log | grep \"string you are looking for\"\n\nthen leave that window open and you will see all matching entries in that window as you work.\nAlso know that when the system.log file is rotated (due to size/time) tail will stop.  you will need to restart the command.\n\nA: *\n\n*sudo /usr/bin/gem install terminal-notifier\n\n*Save this script as ~/bin/logcheck and run chmod +x ~/bin/logcheck\n#!/bin/bash\n\ntmp=${TMPDIR}logcheck\n[ -f $tmp ] && last=$(cat $tmp) || last=\"\"\nfound=$(grep -A-1 \"^$last\" /var/log/system.log | grep -F 'kernel  disk0s1: I/O error')\n[ -n \"$found\" ] && terminal-notifier -message \"$found\"\nlast=$(grep -Eo '^\\w{3} [ \\d]\\d \\d\\d:\\d\\d:\\d\\d' /var/log/system.log | tail -n1)\nprintf %s \"$last\" > $tmp\n\n\n*EDITOR=nano crontab -e, add */5 * * * * ~/bin/logcheck\n", "Q: Clear multiple entries form \"Open With\" context menu How do I clear multiple entries of the same application from the \"Open With\" context menu?\n\nA: You need to reset the Launch Services Database\nUse the following command in the terminal:\n/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Versions/A/Support/lsregister -kill -r -domain local -domain system -domain user \n\nWait until the terminal returns you to a prompt.

One of the new features of Mountain Lion is the fact that one can sync iMessages across iOS and OSX devices.\nI would really like to have a thread that I start on my iPhone automatically sync to my Mac and iPad so I can reply easily from either device. I do understand that SMS text messages will not sync, and only iMessages. \nThis question applies to iOS 6 and Mountain Lion devices as I am running an iPhone 4S and 3rd Gen iPad with iOS 6 and a Macbook Pro with Mountain Lion (OSX 10.8).\nHow can I enable this feature so that my iMessages stay in sync across all my devices?\n\nA: I am on iOS 10.3.1 and macOS Sierra 10.12.3. I need to setup Messages in macOS using https://support.apple.com/kb/HT202549. In iPhone, the settings that allowed me to sync is in Settings > Messages > Send & Receive. I have to login my Apple ID here.\n\nA: iOS (6 and later) combines your phone number with your Apple ID email address, which makes it possible for others to iMessage your phone number and have those Messages sync across your devices.\nFirst, you need to make sure all your devices are on the same Apple ID.\nOn each iOS device (iPhone, iPod Touch, iPad, iPad Mini):\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Settings.app\n\n*Go to \"Messages\" and make sure iMessage is On. \n\n*If iMessage is on, \"Send & Receive\" will appear below it. Tap on it.\n\n*Make note of the Apple ID at the top of the page.\n\n*Select your phone number and email address(es) that you want to sync to that device.\n\n\nOn each Mac: (Mountain Lion or later)\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Messages\n\n*Click Messages -> Preferences\n\n*Click the \"Accounts\" tab in the top.\n\n*Select your iMessage/Apple ID account, and make sure \"Enable this account\" is checked.\n\n*Select your phone number and any email address(es) that you would like synced.\n\n\nThe most important part is that everything is consistent across all devices that are necessary. \n\nMessage History\nThe steps described previously will not automatically cause old iMessages to sync across all devices. However, iOS and macOS now support \"Messages in iCloud\": Apple Support Document. Enabling Messages in iCloud will sync historical messages across all of your devices. Make sure you are running the latest version of macOS or iOS.\nTo turn on Messages in iCloud on your iOS device:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Settings app.\n\n*Tap your Apple ID profile at the top of the list.\n\n*Select iCloud.\n\n*Enable Messages. \n\n\nTo enable on your Mac:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the Messages app.\n\n*In the menu bar, select Messages -> Preferences.\n\n*Open the iMessage tab.\n\n*Select the checkbox to Enable Messages in iCloud.\n\n\n\nAdditional Troubleshooting steps\nIf you are still having trouble getting new iMessages to sync across the devices try:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disabling then re-enabling iMessage on each device that isn't being synced to.\n\n*Delete all your previous conversations: Some people have reported that they had to delete all of their conversations before things would sync up.\n\n*Make sure you have your phone number added to your Apple ID account online.\n\n", "Q: What cable provides support for dual external monitors at 1920x1080 on a MacBook Air? I'm considering getting a new MacBook Air computer and would like it to drive two external monitors at 1920x1080 resolution.\nWhat cable or adapter would I need to run such a configuration?\nA related question for MacBook Pros mentions some solutions that might apply here:\n\n\n*\n\n*Would Two Apple Thunderbolt Displays work?\n\n*Would a DisplayLink adapter work with standard 1080p displays?\n\n\nA: My information is second-hand, but another user at my company gave an strongly enthusiastic recommendation of a \"NewerTech\" USB to DVI adapter.

When reading larger spreadsheets, it would be helpful to highlight the row and column that the currently selected cell is in.  I'm not talking about conditional formatting or anything in the spreadsheet itself, I'm just talking about a viewing option.  I couldn't find a similar option anywhere.\n\nA: If I understand your question, Numbers does this by default - note the darkened row and column identifiers in the image below at AK50.\n\nEdit: ah, I see.. okay, I found an inconvenient hack:\n\n\n*\n\n*Select the Column containing your target cell\n\n*Cmd click the cell above (or the Cmd Click the row index of the cell above)\n\n*Cmd click the Row containing your target cell\n\n*Cmd click to reselect the cell above your target\n\n\nLike so:\n\n\n\nMaybe you could use automator to make this less painful?\n\nA: It is not exactly what you asked for, but holding ⌥ option for a second will highlight the row and column of the cell underneath the cursor. Moving the cursor will update the highlight.\n\nI stumbled upon this by accident, and I don't know when this feature was introduced. For reference, I use Numbers version 12.1.\nApple does mention the shortcut on their user guide for Numbers: \"Highlight the row and column for a cell: Press Option as you move over a cell\". It also works for tables in Keynote and Pages.\n\nA: Another method, useful for selecting a range of rows in a column, is to click on the uppermost cell you want to select, scroll down to the bottom of the range, shift-click on that cell. All rows between will be selected (in addition to the two you clicked on).\n", "Q: Backing Up iTunes 11 Library All the articles I've read suggest that the correct technique to make a local backup of my iTunes 11 library is to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect the pertinent device (iPod)\n\n*Go to the Summary Tab\n\n*Click \"Backup Now\" and follow the instructions.\n\n\nProblem is there is no \"Backup\" feature of any kind offered anywhere in the Summary Tab or anywhere else in iTunes that I could find. Has anyone else noticed this?\n\nA: It sounds like you have gotten a little confused with the difference between backing up your iPod and backing up your iTunes library. You can back up your iPod to iTunes on your computer, but this is different than backing up your iTunes library itself - all the music, movies, books, apps, and such that you have placed in iTunes. \nIf you want to backup your iTunes library\n(Apple.com):\n\n\n*\n\n*Open iTunes Preferences.\n\n*\n\n*Mac: Choose iTunes > Preferences.\n\n*Windows: Choose Edit > Preferences.\n\n\n*Click Advanced.\n\n*Make sure the option to \"Copy files to iTunes Media folder when adding to library\" is selected.\n\n*Choose File > Library > Organize Library.\n\n*Select the option to \"Consolidate files.\"\n\n*Locate your iTunes library. \n\n*\n\n*If you can't find it, open your iTunes Preferences and click \"Advanced.\" The location of your iTunes folder will be listed in the \"iTunes Media folder location\" box.\n\n\n*Copy the iTunes library directory over to your backup location. \n\n\n\nIf you really would like to back up your iPod:\n\n\n*\n\n*Plug your iPod in and view its details.\n\n*Under \"Summary\" tab there is a heading called \"Manually Backup and Restore\"\n\n*Select \"Back Up Now\" from under that heading.\n\n\nFor more information on backing up iOS devices in general, this article is a good start.\n", "Q: How to fix Mountain Lion deadly crashes Over the last 3 months, after I bought my first Mac Mini, which came installed with mountain Lion, I've had to reinstall the OS over 10 times now.\nHere's a list of steps of what happens:\n\n\n*\n\n*I turn it on, the Mac sound comes up.\n\n*It opens up the white screen with the Apple symbol in the middle.\n\n*A little progress bar comes up, loads up around a centimeter.\n\n*Mac turns off.\n\n\nAnd this process can be repeated over and over again if I wish, just have to turn the Mac on again.\nI've tried everything every time this happens, here's a quick list:\n\n\n*\n\n*Resetting PRAM and NVRAM.\n\n*Resetting the System Management Controller.\n\n*Safe boot.\n\n*Using Disk Utility to repart the drive.

Also every solution that I've found on Apple discussions.\nBut nobody seems to have this problem so there isn't any real solution!\nNow, honestly, while it is bothersome to do re-install, I can do it no problem, the problem is that now I don't have a Bootable USB Drive Installer, so I've finally come to ask this.\nDo I need to get a new hard drive? It's the only solution that I can come up with now.

When a problem persists, look elsewhere. \n\nA: Over the past three weeks I've seen this exact problem on two different iMac 27 inch (Core i7) and one MBP, all running 10.8 will all updates. Done all the tricks and still issues. The key to this is the bar that appears when trying to do a safeboot. Gets ~ 1/3 way through and then the mac reboots itself. There's obviously an issue beyond hard drive and logic board failure pointing rather directly to a bug Apple should be fixing.\n\nA: I have an early 2008 iMac doing the same thing. Brought to Apple and they determined I had a bad memory stick which was causing the problem. I replaced but the problem persists.

How can I make the system \"always deny\"?\nWill the \"always allow\" or always deny apply to the computer or to a specific website?\n\nA: There is not an always deny functionality in keychain.

I want to convert my music library to 128kbps AAC (still m4a) to save on hard drive space on a small server.\nThe solution I'm hoping for is a command line based option using ffmpeg or the like. There's nothing Mac-specific about doing it that way but given it's all Apple codecs and I'm doing the conversion on a Mountain Lion box I thought I'd ask here. I can manage most of the shell scripting myself but I don't know ffmpeg well enough to be sure that it retains metadata and album art.\nI've done a conversion in the past with iTunes 10; there's a trick where you manipulate \"Convert higher bit rate songs to 128 kbps AAC\". But the conversion quality is not sufficient. iTunes rewrites filenames in various circumstances, particularly when any non-ASCII is involved. Also it takes more than 20 hours to do the conversion and there's no clean way in iTunes to keep track of what's converted if the batch is interrupted.\n\nA: I realise this is not a command line solution, but I use Max to convert FLAC and ALAC to AAC and MP3 files, and it keeps the metadata intact.\nhttp://sbooth.org/Max/\nIts a very lightweight app.\nThere are also download links and instructions on the site for how to build the app from the source, so maybe the moving parts of the ALAC-to-AAC with metadata conversion could be discerned from there.\nAlso, before compressing lossless rips to save space, maybe give TuneSpan a try, and put your lossless audio on external storage?\nhttp://tunespan.com/#show_demo\n\nA: This seems to preserve most common tags but not cover art (edited to add -vn):\nffmpeg -i alac.m4a -vn -acodec libfaac -aq 110 aac.m4a\n\n-aq 110 is about 130 kb/s for normal music files. -aq 400 would be about 270 kb/s.\nIf you have 4 cores, this runs up to 4 parallel processes:\nfind . -name \\*.m4a | parallel ffmpeg -i {} -vn -acodec libfaac -aq 110 {.}-aac.m4a\n\n\nA: AtomicParsley can remove/add album art from command line\n", "Q: Make apps stop showing as mounted partitions I am new to OS X and have been using it for 5 days.\nWhenever I launch an application, it shows up as a mounted drive in finder and on the desktop. This looks useless and annoying. Is there a way to prevent apps from showing up as mounted drives?\n\nA: If you download an app, it comes packed as disc image in most cases (a file with .dmg extension). If you open this file, this drive image is mounted as new drive. You should move the application that is on that newly mounted drive to your application folder. The image file can be unmounted and deleted. Be sure not to copy the dmg file to your application directory (you can check file extensions by selecting the file and press command+i).\n\nA: Are you sure they are apps and not applications' setup files? App files has .app as extension and setup files has .dmg.\nMac OS X opens the dmg files as mounted drives, not the .app files.\n\nA: What you describe happens if you open the .dmg file and then move the .app straight to the Dock and launch it from there. The right thing to do is to move the .app file first to Applications, and then from Applications to the Dock.\n", "Q: Is there a way to force iTunes 11 to update tags?

When you then click on the folders in the dock you will see a question mark superimposed on the deleted folder. This leads me to believe that these are not true folders but an alias for said folders and behave as such when they are in the dock. If you move a file between your two test folders on the desktop you will get the overwrite prompt as expected.\n\n\nA: No. Icons in the Dock are not contents of the app.\n", "Q: Reverting back to 10.6 from 10.8 , but did not back up my machine while on 10.6 I need to know how I can revert back to 10.6 while not losing my documents.\nI upgraded to 10.8 ML and I did not do a back up prior to upgrading.\nI do have a current 10.8 Time Machine backup.\nCan I do a clean install from 10.6 CD and then restore my iphoto and other documents? Is there perhaps an easier way to rectify my problem?\n\nA: The method you mention first is your best hope for going backwards. It will not work well and many programs may have changed - if so, you will get an error message if the older program were programmed to detect this backwards migration of data.\nThe system stores data in databases scattered in some non-obvious locations:\n\n\n*\n\n*Contacts (Address Book)\n\n*Calendar (iCal)\n\n\nSo, you can also export the data from these programs or check that the data is in iCloud or some other sync service. Then you can see if those programs work back on 10.6 - iCloud won't since it's 10.7.2 or later and Mobile Me is no longer working so for that sort of data, you need to export everything you need to move back to 10.6 (Bookmarks, People, Events) to your desktop and make one last backup using Time Machine.\nNow, you mentioned iPhoto - that too could be problematic, but the good news is the OS update doesn't include iPhoto. As long as you run the same version of the app from before the downgrade (from 10.8) to after the downgrade (to 10.6) - your iPhoto library file should work just fine.\nApple's Migration Assistant won't move the program and it's support files and settings backwards from 10.8 to 10.6, so you will need the original iPhoto install and have to reinstall all third party apps that are more than a simple program you can copy from /Applications. \nSo to make this long explanation short:\n\n\n*\n\n*Apple's migration assistant will not help you move files or programs\n\n*Time Machine stores backups in a plain folder so you can use Finder to connect any TM backup drive to a cleanly installed Mac and copy any and all files by hand - you just have to know which files to move and how to work through any errors when a file or database is too new for an older program to use.\n\n", "Q: Parental Controls Always Allow does not work for Avid Media Composer I've enabled Parental Controls on a new Nov 2012 iMac being used in a school for public access (OS X 10.8.2 Mountain Lion) and have restricted the applications this account can use. Everything works fine with the exception of Avid Media Composer (the main reason we purchased the iMacs...). Avid Media Composer is marked as an application that the account is allowed to use in the parental control settings.\nWhen I try to start Avid Media Composer under this account, a message pops up saying that this user doesn't have permission to use the application, giving the following three options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Always Allow...\n\n*Allow Once...\n\n*OK\n\n\nWhen clicking Allow Once, I have to enter the admin account username and password and the app starts without problems. But when I click Always Allow, it asks for the admin account as well, but then pops up the same message again and again. I have verified that I'm using the right admin account username and password, but it's still refusing to run the application.\nWhen I disable parental controls, everything works, but the moment I turn it on again, it fails, despite having Avid Media Composer in the list of allowed applications for this account.\nIn the Console application, I can see the following error message whenever this happens:\n\ncom.apple.launchd.peruser.504: ([0x0-0x1de1de].com.avid.mediacomposer[2033]) \n  Job failed to exec(3) for weird reason: 13\n\nHas anybody else experienced this or knows how to fix this?\n\nA: I found this problem too!\nTurn off parental control and it works fine.\nInteresting as I have two Mac Pros and one with PCs on does allow MC to work.\nThe other with the PCs on and it does not.\nI suppose best answer is to turn off Parental Controls for an separate account just for users whom use AVID.\n", "Q: iPod Nano wake screen sometimes shows music instead of Clock I've recently purchased a band from Lunatik to use my iPod Nano as a watch.\nTo do this, I've gone into Settings > Date and Time > Time on Wake and put this ON.\nAt first, this worked as expected, showing me the watch face when I hit the 'on' button.\nBut after I've played some music on the Nano, now it sometimes shows me the music application (even though it's not playing) instead of the Clock.\nI've checked and the setting 'Time on Wake' is still on.\nAnyone know how I can avoid this behaviour and always get the Clock when I hit the 'on' button?\n\nA: Might as well answer this.\nI've found out that it depends on what screen you had active before the iPod goes to sleep. If it goes to sleep with the Music screen, that apparently gets priority over the clock on waking (even if you have checked the 'time on wake' setting).\nA workaround I've found is navigating to any Settings screen before putting the iPod to sleep. Upon waking up, he'll 'default' back to the Clock then... Apparently the Music screen has a higher 'priority' than the Settings screen, go figure.\n\nA: If you are playing a playlist or album you have to play the whole thing to the end or just fast forward. Then the player shuts down and reverts back to the clock. \n\nA: I just figured out that if you are only using it as a watch like I am, then simply delete any music on it and it will always wake up in watch mode.  Not sure what to do if you want music. Cheers.  \n\nA: Selecting the Radio app the music app goes off and it's done, there is no more priority\n", "Q: Apple ID shows different names While trying to make a Genius Bar reservation, the name appearing in the reservation is different from the one appearing in my profile—I modified it at some point. Why is that and how can I update the one from the reservations page?\nAlso, when I’m trying to edit it from the reservations page, it redirect to the account page, where the name is correct.\nGenius Bar reservations page:\n\nMy account page:\n\n\nA: You have detected that the database Apple is using for store reservations is different than the one you see on the My Apple ID page.\nYou can correct that information by asking them at the bar to assist in correcting and if they say to log in and change it, you can do that on one of the store machines (or your own if you don't trust Safari's private browsing function) and ask them to check that the changes are effective.\nSometimes, you need to call the main AppleCare support number if there is a problem with your record, but most cases you can fix at the time when you see the difference.\n", "Q: Mountain Lion - Flash sluggish, spinning beachballs etc I upgraded from OS X 10.6.8 Snow Leopard to Mountain Lion 10.8, and then to 10.8.2 Mountain Lion.\nI only have a few installed applications (Photoshop and Microsoft Office), VLC movie player and Firefox - the rest of the system is intact. All fonts required for Photoshop are installed within Library's Adobe/Fonts folder so all Adobe apps can use them.\nHowever, I've had spinning beachballs on using apps, and choppy video playback when using VLC - it did not do that in 10.6.8 with any DVD or video played; and my previous movie player of choice (MPlayer OSX Extended, now uninstalled) was not compatible with Mountain Lion as far as I'm aware - it just crashed or I had to end it.\nAdobe Flash Player does not work, well, except for some Flash-based sites and Google Maps etc - Streetview, and flash-based adverts on Firefox, but it's a bit on-and-off, working on some sites but not others like YouTube - where I get the sound, but not the video, only the spinning grey wheel, and then Firefox crashes.\nSafari won't open multiple tabs either... one tab at a time, unless I open a new tab from within an existing site (tried it on bbc.co.uk today!)\nWhy are these 'beachballs' happening, as I don't have many files, the system Fonts folder is intact, the Adobe fonts folder only has a few fonts [Adobe ones and a few free ones I downloaded] and there aren't that many apps.\nI ran Onyx, repaired disk permissions etc. but don't understand why this is happening - should I just go back to OS X 10.6.8 as my machine had 10.6 (it's a 2010 Mac Mini installed with 10.6).\nThe disk's got 500GB in total (can't remember how much is used, but the size of Photoshop CS5 alongside VLC and Firefox is... well, I'm not sure how much GB is used).\nNew to Mac and OS X in general, so would appreciate the help I can get.\n\nA: In general, newer versions of operating systems (Mac OS, Windows, et al) tend to require more RAM than older versions. If you have less RAM than the OS needs, the computer will use virtual memory paging, which is very slow.\nThe 2010 Mac mini came with 2GB of RAM. OS 10.8 prefers 4GB or more.

I know how to create such rules manually from the preferences menu. However, I wonder if there is any way to do this more efficiently by having some information from the selected email being filled in automatically? I checked the menus and in-app help, but couldn't find anything in this direction.\n\nA: Select the email then using preferences->rules will fill in the values from theemail in the selections e.g. if you choose From it will show who the email is from.\n", "Q: Remove notifications for one specific email account on Mountain Lion's Mac Mail Is it possible to set or disabled Mail notifications on a per-account basis on Mountain Lion's notification center?\nI have shared an email address that gets a lot of emails that I only need to check once in a while and it would be great if I could disable notification for this email. I can't find any settings to do this on Mail preferences or Notifications preferences.\n\nA: Actually, it is possible - here's how:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a smart mailbox ( Menubar > Mailbox > New Smart Mailbox ) which shows the content of all the mailboxes that you would like to get notifications for, and give it a nice name (for example, 'Notifications'). In my case the only rule in this mailbox is a 'Message is in Mailbox' - but you can be creative!\n\n\n\n\n\n*Go to the General section in Mail preferences ( Menubar > Mail > Preferences ) or press ⌘ + ,. About half way down you'll see the setting 'New message notifications' - open the drop-down and select the smart mailbox created under step #1.\n\n\n\n\nA: This worked for me in OS 10.8.3:\nIn System Preferences > Notifications, disable all Notifications from Mail.\nThen in Mail > Preferences > Rules, add a rule the enables notifications for the specific account:\nIf [any] of the following conditions are met:\n[Account] [name of the account you want notifications from]\nPerform the following actions:\n[Send Notification]\n\nA: EDIT: it is possible\nSee @Erwin Wessel's reply below.\n\nDeprecated:\nUnfortunately, this is something that is currently not possible in the standard UI in Mountain Lion/Mail.app or System Preferences. As you are aware, the only choice you get is all or nothing.\nSome thoughts regarding work-arounds:\nBecause it is a shared account, you are limited in what you can do with the message - unless it is POP3. If it was your account, you could create a folder, and a rule, that would cause all the mail to redirect into, skipping the inbox. Again, if this is an IMAP configuration, this wouldn't be desirable as colleagues may not desire all the mail to disappear into some folder.\nYou end up with one main option, if Mail notifications are important on all your other accounts - which it obviously is.\nThe main option would be to simply open Mail Preferences and select the shared account and deselect \"Enable this Account\". Then you would open Preferences and check that box when you want to view the account.\nCaveat: it must be a IMAP setup for that option to work.\nYour second option would be to try using Herald for Mac. (CNET download). However, I have not used it personally and don't know if it would do what you desire, but it looked like there was a chance you could control which Mailboxes received Notifications.\n", "Q: How can I activate iPhone without a SIM card? I've just changed the screen on an iPhone 4S with iOS 6.0.1. Everything went fine until I noticed that the phone was not detecting any SIM card. It doesn't matter what you do with the SIM bay, the phone is always showing \"No Sim\" at the top.\nI've tried to reboot several times with and without the SIM card inserted, different SIM cards, all that stuff with no luck.\nAfter a few hours and with no exits, I've tried to restore the phone but still the same problem. And now, as the SIM is not detected, I can’t activate nor access the phone at all.\nA friend of mine just told me today that he had a similar story but he fixed the problem setting the correct date and time manually. I can't try that now because Apple decided to make this stupid activation process but, as he said, is a common problem with iOS 6.x.x and iPhone 4S.\nNow, do you have any ideas on how can I activate the phone or set the date and time to the correct one just to try if it helps?\n\nA: You can activate a iPhone without a SIM card by jailbraking it.\nSearch YouTube for “jailbraik iPhone 8bitguy”\nIf you use  redsn0w, when it has a checklist of things it can do (like ”Install Cydia”), just uncheck them all and click continue.\n", "Q: Display PowerPoint notes on iPhone during presentation?

This shows up when I click on the Dropbox icon in my top bar.\nI can only see one of the files though, as the menu to see more is grayed out. The error is \"Permission denied\", but I checked the permissions on the file, and it is owned by me. \nQuestions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is there a log file somewhere that shows me the other 699 files with issues?\n\n*Any ideas why some of my files have syncing issues?  Other files are syncing fine.  The OS X account username is the same as it was before my reinstall, although I was wondering if it had something to do with user ID's being different (i.e. the underlying Linux UID, asssuming Dropbox uses it).\n\nA: Dropbox support will walk you through how to fix this on their web site. Search for permission error \"OS X\" and you'll get this link:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://www.dropbox.com/help/72/en\nHere is the summary of steps needed on OS X since the article is mostly about Windows errors and antivirus causes of the same error.\n\nFor our advanced users\nIf unlinking and relinking your account doesn't solve the issue, your settings may be protected or inaccessible due to a permissions problem. If this is the case, you can remove your settings by hand using an administrative account.

Once Dropbox loads, the application will rebuild your settings files and you will be asked to relink to your account.\nNote: We're working on a way to check and fix your Dropbox installation automatically from within the application. Stay tuned...\n\nIf you are reading this and use a version of Dropbox much newer than v1.4.12, you might check Dropbox help before deleting the .dropbox folder and restarting the app, just in case they have implemented a better fix in a newer version of the software.\nIf this doesn't work on your Mac, you might also need to take a second step of renaming the actual Dropbox folder to ensure it can download everything from Dropbox and then use a tool like Kaleidoscope to diff the two folders and check that nothing was lost in the shuffle.\n\nA: I never found a log file that showed all the files that were not syncing, but did figure out where my problem was: I had symlinks to folders that no longer existed under my freshly installed computer.\nI used dropbox.com to search for the one file the menu showed was having syncing issues.

Soft cotton cloth, warm water, a little dishwashing liquid ... gently, gently ... rinse ... dry softly with aforementioned cloth, not in circular fashion but from center of disc towards outer edge, turning disc as you go.\n\nA: Apple has a great guide for troubleshooting a laptop optical drive.  If it's ejecting all discs, you should reset the SMC (and instructions are in the Apple guide above).  If that doesn't work and it's ejecting all discs that you put into it, it's likely that the drive has failed, and you'll need to replace it.  The site that you linked gives instructions for how to do it, and it's not all that hard if you're comfortable taking your laptop apart.\nIf it's only ejecting some discs and not others, then it's possible that you've got a software or OS issue.  Given that you're trying to upgrade the OS, this might actually solve your problem.  If you have access to another Mac, your best bet is to create a USB drive with the Snow Leopard installer on it.\n\nA: I used to have this in the past as well but with discs originally supplied by a specific model (e.g. iMac).

My iPhone's recent calls list correctly shows all the calls I've made or recieved, but some of them apparently have timestamps from the future:  \n\nThis screenshot was taken on Jan 7th. The call labelled \"1:15 PM\" was made that day. The ones at the top of the list, labelled 1/12/13, were actually made sometime the previous week.\nI was messing around with the phone's date and time in response to the Do Not Disturb bug. I had switched \"Set time automatically\" off, and changed the phone's date manually -- probably to 1/12 though I don't recall exactly -- and left it that way (actually forgot about it) for a while. My phone's time was definitely manually set incorrectly when those calls happened, and that seems pretty likely to be the cause.\nI suspect that the answer is \"No\", but is there any way to correct these records?\nI've tried restarting the phone and monkeying around with the date and time again manually, but there's been no change to the list.\nThis is an iPhone 5 running iOS 6.0.1\n\nA: Unfortunately, there's no way to change the Recent calls timestamps.\nYou will either have to wait past the 1/12/13 or you could consider deleting those numbers. Course, you would obviously lose the phone numbers, and that data, but it would keep your true recent calls on top before it starts working again on 1/12/13.\nIt appears to be indeed changing time on the iPhone that has caused this issue, as I was able to repeat it easily. In testing it, I switched off \"automatic\" time, and change the date to tomorrow. After that, I made a phone call and then changed it back to set the time automatically. The phone call that I made during the manual time change indicated that I made the call tomorrow. 1/10/13, in this case.\nSo, your iPhone uses local time - the time that displays on the phone at the top of the screen - to log, order, and display recent calls.\n", "Q: External harddrive changes name sometimes I have bought a new external harddrive to use with my Macbook Air running OSX 10.8.2. I renamed the device to \"750GB External\" and started using it, for example to store some photos which I edit with Picasa. This worked fine for about a week. Suddenly this morning when I plugged in the drive, Picasa could not find any of my photos, because the device now have the name \"750GB External 1\".\nThe drive has format: \"Windows NT Filesystem\" which I guess is standard NTFS. Since I would like to use this drive for Windows computers as well, I do not want to partition this to HFS+. Is there a way to make sure the harddrive will always get mounted with the same name?\n\nA: If your hard drive mounted with a \"1\" at the end, that means the system was somehow holding onto the volume before you had plugged it in again, making it think another volume with the same name was plugged in. Since it can't give an identical path to two items, OS X will add a \"1\" to the end (which shouldn't be permanent).\nAs far as the NTFS question goes, I recommend reformatting your drive in a FAT format. If you are sharing with WinXP, use FAT-32. If you are sharing with Win7, use exFAT. Be sure to backup all data first as the reformat will wipe the drive. NTFS is read-only on a Mac which has obvious limitations for you.\n", "Q: Where can I find a good checkbox app? I have recently started a job as a project manager.

Note that normally, I am leaving the Mac's OS NOT connected to the proxy but rather only having my web browser (Firefox) use the proxy.  Partially because having the Whole Mac configured to proxy did not fix the browser...

You think apple might have fixed that embarrassing bug in its last update. \nThanks!!!\n\nA: You could try using something like WireShark to confirm that your connections are going where you think they are.\n", "Q: Active Directory and FileVault Is there a way to set up users on Mountain Lion to be available in the FileVault boot screen if the users are Active Directory users managed through Quest Authentication Services (QAS)?\nI would like to have the following working:\n\n\n*\n\n*User is managed through AD using QAS\n\n*FileVault encryption is used for the whole disk, not just the user's home directory\n\n*The AD user is used in the FileVault boot screen\n\n\nIs this possible or does anyone use a similar configuration?\nUpdate\nSince I haven't received an answer here, and haven't found a way to use both QAS and FileVault, I have removed QAS (now using a local user account again), and then enabled FileVault 2 for the disk encryption. Logging in with the local user works fine.\nThe downside is that I have to authenticate separately to some network drives now that previously didn't require authentication due to the AD integration, but that's a small price.\n\nA: In our work environment, I have our Macs bind directly to Active Directory with no service (like QAS) in the middle. The AD user has a local home folder, we do not use Network Homes. We use FileVault 2 with no issues. The AD user's name shows up on the FileVault screen and they are able to unencrypt their laptop with their normal network credentials. So yes, it should work fine unless QAS is adding something bizarre into the mix.\n\nA: The only issue is that QAS uses network accounts and not mobile accounts, as it handles credential caching itself and doesn't need a record for each AD user in the local directory.  The reason this is a problem for people wanting to use FileVault is that you have to select the users who can unlock the drive via the Mac's GUI, and network accounts won't show up.  The solution is to log in as an AD user and then convert the account to mobile in the Users & Groups preference pane.  QAS will continue to facilitate authentication with AD and the local directory will make the account available for use with things like FileVault.\n", "Q: How can I get the Creative Sound Blaster X-Fi Surround 5.1 Pro volume control to work? I've been using the X-Fi for some time on Windows and it works great. However, on my MacBook Pro I can't get the volume control to work.\nI see the device in \"System Preferences -> Sound\" and in \"Audio MIDI Setup\" and I can switch output to it and it works great, except for volume control. Is it possible to get it to work too?\n\nA: The workaround I found so far is to use Soundflower as an intermediate filter between PC output and the X-Fi. This allows to control volume from Mac OSX at the price of some sound processing. I cannot comment yet on sound quality but on first auditions it seems to sound better than setting the volume to 1/100 in Songbird (my FLAC player).\n", "Q: Mail account sync via iTunes not working I recently switched from Sparrow.app back to Mail.app and added a whole bunch of accounts. Now I am trying to sync them with my iPhone 5 via iTunes 11, since I am everything but keen on adding them manually in the iPhone settings.\nBut iTunes seems unable to find my accounts:\n \nSo how can I fix this?\n\nA: Looks like this was an ordinary bug, it's working now (iTunes 11.0.2 + iOS 6.0.2)\n", "Q: Is it possible to reinstall Mountain Lion using Lion Time Machine backup? I have an old MacBook which cannot run anything newer than 10.7.5 Lion. I do regular Time Machine backups to an external drive. I plan to buy a new MacBook Air, but I want to make the migration as smooth as possible, with all my apps, configs and files copied and set just like on the old Mac. I was thinking of re-installing Mountain Lion on the new Air and selecting the old Lion backup as \"from backup\" source during installation. Will it work? Has anyone tried this and can share experience/problems?\nOr maybe I should downgrade Air to Lion (how?), re-install from backup, then upgrade to ML?\n\nA: When a newer Mac migrates data from an older OS, the system has upgrade scripts to make sure that the data lands properly on the new system.\nThese scripts handle all Apple software and perhaps a few high profile programs in case that Apple has found a need to clean up other data.\nMigration the other way isn't tested, no scripts or support is provided and in fact, the system normally detects you are moving data backwards and refuses to restore in the first place.\nYou should be fine restoring a Lion backup onto any Mac with Mountain Lion. You don't need to reinstall anything - just don't run the Setup Assistant until you have the external drive and can move everything to the new mac.\nRunning an older OS on a newer Mac is also problematic, since often drivers are missing and again, Lion will check and refuse to install on hardware that is too new in general.\n\nA: The best way is to use the Setup Assistant the first time you start your new Mac. This will copy the data either from the backup or directly from the old Mac. This will copy all of your users and the file ownerships will be set up correctly. If you do go Mac-to-Mac be sure to use an ethernet cable because it will take days using wireless. I migrated a Lion MBP to a new Mountain Lion MBP last summer and it worked very well for me.\n", "Q: What is the dotted blue underlining when I use dictation on OS X? When I use the dictation feature in OS X, sometimes some of my text has got dotted blue underlining below it after entry:\n\nWhat does this mean? Am I able to use it to correct the mistakes in the text more easily?\nI am using OS X 10.8.\n\nA: This highlighting \"hyperlinks\" the text, if the system is unsure of what you said. It will typically take a couple of best guesses, and display them as options from which you can choose from. You can see the suggestions by right-clicking the word or control clicking it.\nIt also selects the text when you click on it, which allows you to simply type a replacement if the options provided aren't correct.\nThis article may provide helpful information on dictation.\n\nA: The blue underline allows you to control click and select from alternate transcriptions of the sounds for that phrase.\nThe blue underline is similar to the red underline that appears when the system detects alternate suggestions for a typed word. \nIn this case, it might have a high confidence that you could have said one of several phrases and offers you both an indication that there is some doubt about that dictation as well as a shortcut to choose from an alternate word choice.\nOddly, this isn't covered in the Mac Basics: Dictation article that does have a helpful list of editing tips and punctuation words that are supported.\n", "Q: Why does Google Chrome replace \"fl\" with blocks on all PDFs it shows, but Adobe Reader works fine?

How can I minimize total cost of ownership (primarily means low monthly rate) for an iPhone if my voice and data usage is light?\n\nA: Update: The following rate plan is no longer available.\n\nAT&T has a $(25+5)/month GoPhone service plan that works with an iPhone that you acquire yourself.\nThe $25/month GoPhone service provides 250 minutes (extra cost $0.10/minute). The $5/month data package provides 50 MB data (extra costs $5/50MB). To save 10%, don't buy credit directly from AT&T. Instead, purchase a discounted electronic refill card such as the TMI Wireless $100 refill for $90 and paste the card number into the AT&T GoPhone website. This brings the actual total cost to $27/month for base usage.\nThere are also the one-time costs of a GSM-compatible iPhone (e.g. used from eBay, either unlocked or locked to AT&T) and an AT&T GoPhone Micro SIM Card ($4). Setup involves installing and activating the SIM card.\nIf you need more than 50 MB data, there is the $40/month plan, which has 500 minutes and 200 MB data ($36/month after 10% off).\nPer the rate plan terms, you could in theory buy the $60/month plan for one month, and use it to buy 1 GB data packages for $10 each, then switch back to the $25/month plan and keep the data from expiring using a $5 for 50 MB auto-refill. However, the $25/month rate plan has an undocumented data package cap of 150 MB; data above that is lost when you switch rate plans.\n\nA: Walmart has unlimited voice and data for $45. It is called Straight Talk. It uses AT&T cell signal and is fully functional except for visual voicemail. \nYour iPhone does need to be unlocked. \n\nA: For iPhones with CDMA (Sprint) hardware, Virgin Mobile has a no-contract plan for $30/month + taxes, fees, and surcharges.\n\nA: With great savings over major carriers, two services we enjoy using (billed automatically to a credit card):\n\n\n*\n\n*For USA, Consumer Cellular (“CC”  www.ConsumerCellular.com) offers inexpensive, flexible voice and data plans (adjustable anytime before monthly bill date), with no contracts.  CC has GSM mini SIM cards for older unlocked phones. \n\n*For USA and 197 countries worldwide, TelnaMobile.com offers GSM SIM cards (dual mini/micro sizes) for $19/year plus usage rates/minute at very low cost (especially cheap with a WiFi internet connection).  Parent Telna.com also offers both \"dial around\" long distance and a worldwide calling card.\nNote: Check tech specs to see which phones SIM cards will fit.  CC and Telna do not yet offer nano size SIM cards required for iPhone 5 or iPad Mini. \nHere's more info about both (Feel free to delete or edit if too much):\n\n\n*\n\n*www.ConsumerCellular.com  (\"CC\") \na. Consumer Reports (not related) ranked CC the #1 Best mobile phone service, with highest ratings for value and customer services, in its January 2012 & 2013 issues.\nb. CC offers national service on AT&T’s GSM system.  GSM is also the international mobile standard, so phones should work in most of the world.\nc. CC has no contracts, sends text & email alerts if usage approaches limits, and allows customers to change voice or data plans (up or down) at any time, including the current month, to save costs and avoid extra usage fees.\nd. Because CC un-locks phones, we can buy a cheap GSM SIM card for local service—either (i) worldwide [e.g. TelnaMobile.com SIM for 198 countries] or (ii) separately in any country we visit.  Many family and friends do so when crossing boarders in Europe. \ne. Since we remove our CC SIM card outside the USA, we pay zero international roaming charges (typically $1 to $3 per minute otherwise).  Incoming calls go to voice mail, which we check periodically when traveling, as we’ve done for years.\nf. Voice plans are much cheaper at CC.  For our typical usage while in USA, we pay less than half of what AT&T charged (on the same network!).  When outside the USA, we pay only $10/phone for standby, instead of full price monthly.  (But AT&T would not suspend, reduce, or change service plans, so we were previously stuck with the total contract cost!)\ng. Flexible Data plans for modest usage start at $2.50/month, and can also be adjusted up or down any time.  (Zero cost for no service when overseas, or just using WiFi.)\nh. Instead of expensive cellular data, we use Wi Fi for Internet, email, photos, data files, etc. both at home and via free hotspots when traveling.  Free or low cost Wi Fi is offered in numerous restaurants, hotels, tourist offices, public spaces, etc.\n\n*http://www.telnamobile.com  and  http://www.telna.com\na.Telna says its SIM card will connect to cellular services in 197 countries of the world.  Cost is $19/year plus usage at very low rates, especially cheap with a WiFi internet connection.  This is far simpler and easier, and costs much less than renting phones, buying SIM cards, or paying hotel phone fees when traveling abroad.  It does require some tech savvy to navigate the differences in phone systems from one country to another.\nb.  We also added Telna \"dial around\" long distance to our cellular phones for overseas calls (big savings--e.g., only 4 cents/minute to France land line).  \nc.  Telna offers customers a worldwide calling card that can be used to dial from any phone anywhere (rates are inexpensive, but vary due to charges by local providers at point of origin for calls).\nFinally, we're happy customers, and don't have any other affiliation with either company.\n", "Q: How to avoid auto starting playback when importing playlist in iTunes library Whenever i import a large folder into iTunes i have the problem that if in one of the subfolders there is a playlist, it will auto start playing.

I wonder if there was a way to drop all the social-related network traffic that goes into Spotify and somehow nip these notifications at the bud.\n\nA: Answer here solves your problem:\n# \"Usernoted\" seems to be the \"user notifications daemon\", so get it's PID.\npid=$(ps aux | grep -i [u]sernoted | awk '{print $2}')\n\n# Find the sqlite3 database that this program has open.

I have just formatted my drive, and performed a fresh install of Mac OS X Mountain Lion from USB flash drive. When doing my first Software Update, within the App Store application, under the Updates section, the first listed update is the weird looking string \"DAHSoftwareUpdate\" with title field having the value \"DAHSoftwareUpdatesPage.OSUpdates.Title\".\nUnderneath this title, is the correct name of the update (OS X Update Combined 10.8.2, iTunes 11.0.1. Also under the progress bar I see FileSize.MB of FileSize.MB, then the remaining time in minutes.\nThis seemed odd to me, especially after I get zero google results for \"DAHSoftwareUpdate\" or even \"SoftwareUpdatesPage.OSUpdates.Title\".\nOne possibility, that seems extremely remote, is that the MountainLion.dmg which has been moved around between my backup drives a lot, might have been corrupted, and I'm seeing a weird bug in the AppStore app as a result. It seems much more likely that this is a result of something like a bad localization/language setting, but that would not account for the zero hits for the variable names showing. \nCan someone explain what's going on here?\n\nA: This issue resolved itself after that single update. \nI did reboot once without updating, and the glitch persisted past that boot, but after the update in question was done and the laptop rebooted, there was no recurrence.\nAs for the likelihood of a corrupted installer dmg, @KevinChen points out that \"there is a lot of checksumming that goes on when you open DMGs and apps, so corruption seems unlikely\"\n", "Q: Enable Internet Sharing over Bluetooth PAN I'm trying to share my MacBook Pro's internet connection with my iPad over Bluetooth. The MacBook is running Snow Leopard.\nOn the Sharing preference page, I can select Ethernet as the source, but when I select Bluetooth PAN (or any of the other options) for the target, nothing happens. The status next to Internet Sharing changes to Off, and I can't check the Internet Sharing option in the list on the left.\nSelecting another entry from the list (like Screen Sharing) and then going back to Internet Sharing, everything is back to the initial state with a red status and the message that I need to select how to share the connection.\n\nIs anyone familiar with this issue and can explain why this is happening and how to fix it?\n\nA: Maybe you need to update Snow Leopard via combo update. It happens sometimes that an earlier version has problems with internet sharing (sometimes even an update could break it). \nFor example I could not establish successful Internet sharing on OS X Tiger 10.4.11, but with 10.5.8 I had the best experience. \nFor Snow Leopard, maybe you could try 10.6.8? 10.7.5 Internet sharing is working, although sometimes, it's not fully stable. It can be that you need to click on connected iPad/iPhone and same time on \"Connect to\" on established Bluetooth connection on the Mac to get it working.\n", "Q: Add video to camera roll without using iPhoto? I have a bunch of video recorded and stored in Dropbox from another iOS device, I'd like to move this onto a new iOS device.\nSo far, the only way I can see of adding these videos to my Camera Roll is to put them into iPhoto on the Mac, add them to an album, then Sync that Album to the new device.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: The best solution I found in the end was to use iTunes, select Photo syncing then instead of using iPhoto, manually selecting a folder full of video. This had to be video that iOS could play natively, it didn't do any kind of conversion or compression. \n\nA: iOS doesn't currently have a good system for manually putting media onto your iOS device. I asked a similar question, and came to the conclusion that transferring large numbers of videos to an iOS device is a job left largely to iPhoto. The process you described is the best that I have found.\nDepending on the number of videos you have and how much time you want to put into you may have a couple options, aside from iPhoto.\n\n\n*\n\n*You could try using SimplTransfer to transfer between devices.\n\n\n*\n\n*I've tried using it, but it seems to timeout or come up with some error when I'm transferring videos. There is a full version, which may or may not be better.\n\n\n*It is possible to email videos (tap and hold video in Mail.app to save) to yourself, and then save them to the device.\n\n\n*\n\n*I'm guessing iOS compresses the video before sending it, so you likely will end up with a loss of quality in the end device.\n\n\n\nA: I just found a simple solution, first select your videos and then transfer them via Airdrop, piece of cake.. Just turn it on, on both devices, select them and send ^^\n\nA: if its your new primary device you could use icloud, however, manually its ether with an app like iExplorer or get the Dropbox app and saving them!\n\nA: First download the app \"Download Manager Lite\" then email the viedeo to yourslef.

It used to appear on my desktop and in my Finder sidebar, but now it won't show up in either place (I do have \"Hard disks\" and \"External disks\" turned on in the Finder sidebar options).\nThe drive does seem to be mounting fine: the drive and partition are visible in Disk Utility and I can browse to it in Finder if I use the Finder's \"Go to Folder...\" command and type /Volumes/Drobo/. I can read/write to it fine once I've navigated to it.\nI have the latest version of Drobo's Dashboard utility installed, and my firmware is up to date. Any ideas? Is this a sign that my external drive is starting to die?\nEDIT: I've resolved this problem with the help of Drobo's tech support. See my own accepted answer below. I've revised this answer to make it less Drobo-specific, since it ended up being a filesystem thing.\n\nA: With the help of Drobo's technical support who pointed me to this MacRumors thread, I've resolved the issue. It turned out that somehow my drive got set to \"invisible\", which is a filesystem attribute. I don't think this setting is settable via the Finder, so I'm not sure how it got set like that.\nTo confirm the issue, I had to install Xcode and then install the command line tools, then run this Terminal command:\nGetFileInfo /Volumes/Drobo/\n\nwhere /Volumes/Drobo/ is the path to the volume in question. This command returns all the attributes set for that volume. If the list of attributes includes a V (capital V), it means that the volume is invisible.\nTo fix it:\nSetFile -a v /Volumes/Drobo/\n\nwith a lowercase v, to remove the invisible attribute.\nAfter a reboot, everything was back to normal.\nNote: depending on the drive and your permissions, it's possible you will need to run these commands with sudo, although I didn't.\n\nA: There is a quicker way to do this without Xcode\nApplications -> Utilities -> Terminal\nchflags nohidden /Volumes/Drobo/\n\nThat should achieve the same result.\n\nA: Since the storage works just fine, it's more likely a problem with the software and/or a mismatch between your drobo software and the firmware on the device than it is a problem with the hardware.\nHave you checked this article - specifically making sure you have no firewall (Mac OS X or something else like Little Snitch).\nIt's always possible that the portion of the Drobo that should be sending your Mac information has failed, but that's not as easy to fix other than attempting to re-flash the firmware. I'd personally open a support ticket with Drobo to be sure you are getting the best advice before flashing the HW.\nAlso, when OS X mounts a new drive, it will check the filesystem and since Drobo reports such a huge size, this could take a very long time before the icon shows up. I've seen this take more than 24 hours - expecially when the Drobo software doesn't see the device or is having issues helping drobo's filesystem get mounted in a timely manner.\n", "Q: itunes software upgrade not syncing music I made the mistake of upgrading itunes software and when I plugged in my iphone 4 it erased all of my music. I have since tried to resync but it is stuck on the 2nd song copy and I cant seem to figure out why? All of my songs are still on my computer and on a separate hard drive but I dont understand why it wont sync?\n\nA: This clearly isn't how an iTunes upgrade is supposed to go. There are quite different strategies for fixing sync issues depending on whether you have a Mac or a PC, so the best I can offer is to work from the script and perhaps ask another question if you have a problem with a specific step.\n\n\n*\n\n*iOS: Syncing with iTunes (KB HT1386)\nAlso, the problem could be entirely on the iTunes end - so it's a bit of a game to eliminate things one by one.

This will let you focus on either the iPhone or the computer.\n", "Q: Are the 4 LCD screws to fix the LCD replacement in an iPad critical? I just successfully replaced the front glass of my 3th Gen iPad WiFi, but when I cleaned up my desk, I found out I forget to use the 4 LCD screws:  \n\nIs it worth it working another hour to open up the iPad again and place those screws in place? Or are the adhesives strong enough to keep the LCD in place? \n\nA: Go back in unless you are worried you will break it the second entry.\nAdhesives won't hold under vibration and shock like a screw will and the screw pressure is what helps set the adhesive in the first place.\n\nA: I realize it may be better to reopen the unit and replace the screws, but I still have the first iPad 2 I replaced the screen on and I completely misplaced my LCD screws. I just decided to put pressure on the back of the unit to hold the adhesive to both the covered glass and unit.\nI've found over the last few years in the dusty environment of my farming community that it works just great anywhere. However I can understand that you may not want the LCD placing any pressure on the backside of the new digitizer.\nIf you are proficient at getting back in the unit I'd try to put them where they belong but mine works just great the way it is without the corner support screws.\n\nA: The might be important for keeping it from falling apart with rough use, but if the adhesive is good, you should be OK.  I did this once and I put a duck tape on the edge of my Ipad just to make sure the digitizer and LCD wouldn't come off.  I didn't heat the adhesive because I didn't want to spend another hour or two prying off tiny shards of glass the next time the screen broke.  The duck tape might not look great to some people, but it gave it a little extra padding and worked well until I broke the screen again.  I am in the process of replacing the screen for the second time and it's a lot easier to cut the duck tape than it is to work with that nasty adhesive.\n", "Q: Is there a GUI viewer of databases created by Database Events? I wrote a simple AppleScript that saves data to a Database Events database. I see the database (DBEV file) in my ~/Documents/Databases folder, and I am wondering if there is a simple graphical utility that I can use to view its contents.\n\nA: I ended up creating my own: https://github.com/dtrebbien/Songs-Database-Viewer\nIn my case, the database is a simple database of songs, where each record has \"Artist Name\" and \"Song Title\" fields, so my Songs Database Viewer just has two columns for those fields. Though, Songs Database Viewer is adaptable to other schemas by adding more table columns in Interface Builder and setting the identifiers of the table columns to the field names.\nAlternatively, a Database Events database is based on SQLite3, so the DBEV file can be opened with the command line sqlite3 utility. On Lion, the two important tables are ZRECORD and ZFIELD. Each row in ZRECORD corresponds to a Database Events record and each row in ZFIELD corresponds to a Database Events field.\n", "Q: How can I extend the time when system.log gets turned over?

You can also prune on size for a while if you wish, since that's easier to know when you'll want a prune based on how large a file you expect.\n\nA: If you are simply looking for ways to establish a timeframe for a crash, then either of the following may help:\n% sysctl -a | grep boottime\n\n% last | grep crash\n\n\nA: Since your ultimate goal is to trace the history of information in the system.log files, you could, as an alternative, try grep from the command line, and search all system logs at once. I'm not a pro with grep, but looking for something like \"shutdown\" in all logs could be done via: \n\ngrep shutdown /var/log/system.log* \n\nThis would produce a single output with any line containing the word \"shutdown\". The * at the end is a regular expression that expands the search to all files starting with system.log, regardless of the extension that follows (e.g., system.log.0.bz2, system.log.0.bz3). If you grok regular expressions, aka \"regex\" (I do not), then you can further augment this kind of search and make it ridiculously powerful and specific. You can check out this link and this link for more information about regular expressions. \nAlso, if you wanted to view the results outside of Terminal, you could pipe the results to a plain text file via: \n\ngrep shutdown system.log* | ~/Desktop/results.txt \n\nI realize this doesn't restructure your system logs, but it does get you the end result you're looking for. \n", "Q: How do I monitor the total physical and virtual memory usage of a process and all of its descendants? From the command line, how would I get the total physical and virtual memory usage of a process and all of its descendants (not just 1st-level children)?\nThis is useful when you want to monitor the memory usage of applications that are not monolithic. For instance, Google Chrome spawns a whole bunch of workers and renderers, even though to the user, it's all in only one GUI window. Another example is Firefox, which has separate processes for its plugins.\nThe Activity Monitor application can display the processes in a hierarchy. But I find it not good enough, for two reasons:\n\n\n*\n\n*It's not command-line;\n\n*It doesn't sum the numbers for me.\n\n\nA: If using third-party applications is a possibility, I would suggest that you install the htop process monitor, perhaps from Macports. This tool extends top with a nice layout, and most relevant for your use case, it has an arbitrarily deep thread tree view that can be turned on with the F5 key.\n", "Q: Keeping MacBook Pro on Sleep Mode for days I usually use my MacBook Pro for programming purposes and is mostly open about 14 hours a day, with 2-3 hours being plugged in until the charging is complete and then I disconnect from power afterwards to cycle the battery. When I leave for home, I just put the machine on Sleep Mode by closing the lid and not actually shutting it down. I only shut it down every Friday for the weekend.\nWill this harm my MacBook Pro in some way? Will the battery life get reduced if this is done? It is also connected to Wi-Fi the whole week, if that matters.\n\nA: This is pretty close to my typical MacBook Air usage. Luckily, it seems that we're on track:\n\nFor proper maintenance of a lithium-based battery, it’s important to keep the electrons in it moving occasionally. Apple does not recommend leaving your portable plugged in all the time. An ideal use would be a commuter who uses her notebook on the train, then plugs it in at the office to charge. This keeps the battery juices flowing.\n\nSee Apple's page on laptop batteries for lots more information: apple.com\nKeep in mind that MacBook batteries are estimated to live through around 1000 charge-discharge cycles before their max capacity drops to 80% (same source). Try to approximate the ideal scenario Apple describes, and avoid running the battery to near-zero between every charge.\n", "Q: Screen Sharing on iPhone Is it possible on the iPhone to share the screen live? In other words I would have an app on the iPhone that would allow a person to see my screen live while they watched via a secure URL. \nI have seen some apps that allow for screen sharing of files from the iPhone but not the actual screen. \nIf it is not possible to share the screen live is it possible to record a video of the screen? \nNotes: I am not looking for ways to control another iPhone just show the screen live, I am not on a jailbroken iPhone, and I am running iOS 6. Also I am curious to the same for the iPad. \n\nA: For recording the screen as a video, this site seems to sum up the ways nicely:\nhttp://www.apptamin.com/blog/capture-iphone-ipad-screen-video/\nHope it helps.\n\nA: So if you're looking for a solution to \"stream\" your iPhone screen directly to the Internet, the answer is NO.\nBut if you are willing to break the problem down to two, that might be possible with an external computer, PC or Mac, though PC is recommended.\nTwo break it into two parts, you first want your iPhone screen to appear on the Mac or PC's screen. We'll use something called \"Airplay Mirroring\", and on Mac and PC, \"Air Server\", or an app on Mac \"Reflector\". You can find both Air Server and Reflector on the Internet, and both offers trial.\nThen you want to stream your Mac or PC's screen to the Internet. On Mac, I DON'T prefer any application, they are all slow and have poor quality. This is what I like, \"321ShowIt\", which is Java-based, but works better than the solutions here.\nThere's also a down side to 321ShowIt, it streams to a webpage that needs Java to watch. But those other solutions streams to Twitch, where people need only Flash, and have dedicated apps on both iOS and Android.\nOn PC, you of course can use 321ShowIt, but I prefer XSplit Broadcaster, it's an amazing high quality streaming application for a wide range of platform, including Justin.tv and so on.\nSo, if those don't suit your need, a jailbreak will be required. But even so, you will be limited to providing VNC connection. Streaming from iOS device is really not a good option since compressing the H.264 stream and serving it live will cause a noticeable performance hit on even the fastest Apple A6. \nAnyway, good luck!\n\nA: Check this out..\nhttp://mgalligan.com/post/29978268510/screen-share-iphone-live-on-internet\nHope it Helps...\n", "Q: How to serve the personal website from different folder? So far, I read on MacRumors of:\n\nSystem-wide site\nFiles at /Library/WebServer/Documents will, by default, be shared as the root Web site when Web sharing is turned on. These files can be accessed at http://localhost/ or http://<yourIPaddress>.\nUser-specific sites\nFiles at ~/Sites, or in your home folder's Sites folder, are considered your user-specific site files.

Each user's site can be accessed at http://<yourIPaddress>/~(shortusername).\n\nIt's all depicted when activating Web Sharing:\n\nBut my static files are in a different folder, so I would like to serve them from ~/Projects/js-spa instead of from ~/Sites, but reading about configuring Apache, I can't find /etc/httpd/httpd.conf on Lion.\nHow can I configure where do I want to serve the personal website from?\n\nA: If you're up for it, httpd.conf should be in /etc/apache2/ on Lion/ML. Some mac-centred help is at this blog.\nHave a look at \"How to turn Mac OS X Lion into a web server?\" for instructions on the Web Sharing pane, and doing similar things in Terminal under Mountain Lion.\n\nA: As Cathy mentioned, you can accomplish this in Lion/Mountain Lion in just 3 easy steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*open /etc/apache2/httpd.conf in your favourite editor (sudo it)\n\n*search for \n\n\n*\n\n*DocumentRoot \"/Library/WebServer/Documents\" and \n\n*<Directory \"/Library/WebServer/Documents\">\nand replace /Library/WebServer/Documents with the path you want Apache to serve for localhost, e.g., /Users/<username>/Projects\n\n*restart Apache: sudo apachectl restart\n", "Q: Headphone jack broke and got stuck in headphone socket MacBook Pro The tip of the headphone jack got stuck in the headphone socket of my MacBook Pro and I have the following question:\nThe \"Sound\" option in the System Preferences displays sound output through the \"Headphones\"\nHowever as the headphone's jack is broken, the headphone doesn't work.\nIf I pull the headphone out, the \"Speaker\" icon in the menu bar greys out and sound seems disabled.\nIf I plug in the headphone in, the \"Speaker\" icon in the menu bar appears as working however as the headphone itself is broken, there is no sound.\nWhere I live, it is not possible to buy a micro screwdriver to open the MacBook Pro and push away the headphone jack from the headphone plug.\nAs a temporary solution I would like to use some AppleScript or other program code to force sound output through the MacBook Pro's speakers instead of the headphones, while the headphones are plugged in.\n\nA: Depending on the breakage, you may not be able to control the software if the \"jack detection\" sensor is intermittent. It will over rule whatever software setting you have made and send output to the headphone jack each time it senses an insertion.\nOften taking this to Apple at a genius bar is no cost if they can dislodge the broken piece with experience (and same for reputable repair shops). Also, you might only pay labor if the jack isn't broken. Usually there is more damage since why would a protected piece break off inside a perfectly functioning receptacle, but it's possible you broke the jack mostly or entirely before inserting it.\nGive a shot at setting the sound in the System Preferences, but most of the times this happens, you'll need to get a repair if you can't use software to switch the output once and have it stick.\n\nA: if you get a 3.5mm jack broken inside the headphone socket, to remove the broken jack, take out the ink tube from a bic pen, you gently push the ink tube into the headphone socket, (use the end that is not used for writing). i would push about 1/2 to a inch in, then pull it out the ink tube and out comes the broken jack.\n\nA: To force output through the speakers, open System Preferences > Sound (Easy keyboard shortcut, Option-Mute Key). In the 'Output' tab, you can choose the device for sound output. Pick \"Internal Speakers\".\nIf that doesn't work, at the bottom of the window there is a \"Use audio port for\" drop-down. Pick \"Sound Input\".\n", "Q: Any way to delete custom fields of cards in Contacts.app? Some custom fields of contact cards in Contacts.app are really annoying.

I have automator running several applescript commands that I want to happen sequentially. For example, I have an empty trash command, then a shut down command. When I run the script, the computer shuts down before the trash empties more than a few files.\nHow do I make sure that automator completes one task before moving on?\nI also have a terminal command for backing up using time machine. I would also like that one to finish before the shut down.\n\nA: Unfortunately empty trash is a message sent to Finder, and, from Automator's point of view, the task finishes when the message is sent.\nIn this conversation there's a possible solution. You have to modify your Applescript task with a check on the size of the trash:\ntell application \"Finder\"\n    set first_size to \"\"\n    set second_size to \" \"\n    set trash_folder to (path to trash folder)\n\n    empty trash\n\n    repeat until first_size is equal to second_size\n        set first_size to size of (info for trash_folder) as integer\n        delay 2\n        set second_size to size of (info for trash_folder) as integer\n    end repeat\nend tell\n\nThis way the task will not end until the size of the trash stops decreasing.\nIf you use tmutil for time machine backup terminal command, there is a -b option for startbackup command that tells the script to wait until the backup is finished before exiting.\n", "Q: How do I increase \"ulimit -u\" (max user processes)? I can change all of the usual ulimits via (for instance) ulimit -n 8192 and launchctl limit maxfiles 8192 8192. Somehow, this doesn't seem to work for -u, the maximum number of user processes:\n~$ sudo launchctl limit maxproc 8192 8192\n~$ sudo launchctl limit maxproc\n    maxproc     2048           2048\n-- in a new terminal:\n~$ ulimit -u\n1064\n\nI do get a \"failed to fork\" every once in a while, and it's quite annoying having to kill a bunch of processes when \"kill\" can't start :) (i.e. I usually resort to just rebooting the machine).\nWhat's the correct way to change the maximum number of user processes? \n\nA: http://blog.ghostinthemachines.com/2010/01/19/mac-os-x-fork-resource-temporarily-unavailable/ talks about this issue in great detail.\nWhen you do sudo launchctl limit maxproc, you're viewing or changing the system-wide launchd limits.\nWhen you do launchctl limit maxproc, you're viewing or changing the launchd limits for your user.\nOne thing to keep in mind is this:\n\nThe root user can increase the hard limits of the system-wide launchd,\n  without a reboot.  However, you cannot change a user’s launchd hard\n  limits without a reboot (even if trying to do so as the root user).\n\nBasically, the hard limit (the right hand column) that is displayed when you initially do launchctl limit maxproc will be the limit that you can set using ulimit -u without rebooting.  Logging out and back in will not work.  Even if you change whats displayed by launchctl limit maxproc, the initial hard limit remains.  See this answer for a bit more info on the relationship between ulimit and launchctl limit.\nTo raise that limit, you have to\n\n\n*\n\n*edit/create /etc/sysctl.conf to raise the maximum processes supported by the kernel\nkern.maxproc=2500\nkern.maxprocperuid=2500\n\n\n*edit/create /etc/launchd.conf to raise the hard limits of the system-wide launchd at boot time\nlimit maxproc 2500 2500\n\n\n*reboot\nAlso note that 2500 seems to be the maximum limit that kern.maxproc can be set to.

I know changing the IMEI number of the phone, is illegal in most countries.\nI'm basicly curious about two things:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is that possible?\n\n*If it is not possible; why is that so hard, technically? (Considering the fact that it is written somewhere in the phones memory.)\n\n\nA: Apart from the fact that it is illegal (in most if not all countries), you might want to think about why you would ever want to change the IMEI on your phone. I can think of only a few reasons why you would want to do that: \n\n\n*\n\n*clear the identity of a stolen phone\n\n*clear information about phone manufacturer and model\n\n*research\n\n\nNumbers 1 and 2 are highly questionable I would say. But to answer your questions: \n\n\n*\n\n*Depending on the phone it could be possible, unless a one time programmable chip is used to store it, changing the IMEI would mean changing that chip, and since that's usually baked on the phones motherboard, it requires you to change that completely then.\n\n*Why is it made so hard? Well to prevent you from clearing the identity of a stolen phone mostly.\n\n\nConsider the IMEI of your phone the same as the chassis number of your car, why on earth would you want to change that, unless you have criminal intent?\n\nA: The only way to change IMEi on iPhone is by reassembling another motherboard with new baseband module\n", "Q: How to identify the 3 thermals sensor connectors from the mac mini motherboard?

We have a new 10.8 machine now connected to active directory which is working for all users except one (the main user of course). Everyone but him can login using AD credentials, which he can as well until they change...which leads me to believe that it's actually authenticating against a local account.\nI have tried re-building his account multiple times by deleting his user directory and then logging in again. The one thing that I did when he first logged in was tell 10.8 to create a mobile account since he's on a laptop and he needs to be able to login away from the network. I've disabled automatic creation of mobile accounts upon login and rebuilt the account (as described above) but it still logs in locally.\nI know it's logging in locally because if I disconnect the network I'm still able to login.\nDoes anyone know how I can remove the \"mobile account\" setting from this account or have any ideas of what else could be causing this problem?\nThank you for any assistance you can provide, I'm stumped.\nDanny\n\nA: I think Keychain Access is caching the old login info and causing problems each time the info changes. Try deleting the existing login keychain and creating a new one and see if that resolves the problem. \nEverytime the AD login info changes the keychain needs to be manually updated to reflect those changes or this kind of problem will persist.\n\nA: So it turns out the fix was to use the command below to remove the account from the system and then rename the user's folder before logging in again (not sure if removing the user folder was necessary, but we did it to be on the safe side).\ndscl . delete /users/\n", "Q: Recovering data from a phone stuck in restore mode I have an iphone 4 that is stuck in restore mode after trying to update to ios 6 wirelessly.

We have multiple users that are assigned MacBook Pro's who we know never take them away from their desks. We need some sort of proof to repurpose this hardware and issue them an iMac. We would really like a terminal command we can send or a script we could run to determine the last time the laptop was unplugged.\nSo far everything we've found just tells you its current state, but not \"timer\"?\n\nA: You might be able to use ioreg to determine the cycle count of the battery. A low cycle count indicates that the battery has not been discharged and charged very much. \nioreg -l | grep Capacity\n\n\"Cycle Count\" shows how many times the battery has been cycled. You can read more about battery cycle counts here.\nAnother idea is to use pmset to log the state of the system's power. You could, in theory, have that dump to a file to investigate after some time has passed.\nTake a look at the man page for pmset. \npmset -g pslog will log the state of system's power. As the device is unplugged or plugged you'll see the log update. This could show how frequently a notebook is unplugged and charged. If it remains plugged in for long spans of time, or is often drawing from 'AC Power' then you'd know if it's mobile or not.\n\nA: I had a similar dilemma and I actually greped the syslog for the magsafeStateChanged event... worked like a charm.

So I am wondering if my computer gets securely erased like zeroing it out or does it just erase it?\n\nA: The erase is very secure - I've not heard of a single success in recovering any data from a one pass zero with modern hard drives. As to what really happened, it depends on what setup your computer has.\nIn the case of FileVault 2, the erase process is very rapid. Everything on the drive is scrambled - even blank space looks no different than a file like a spreadsheet or a picture. The erase command simply destroys the cryptographic keys and effectively destroys everything in a short amount of time.\nIn the case where you don't have Filevauly, I believe a normal one pass zero is performed based on how long it takes. I don't see any official documentation from Apple and also haven't seen someone forensically analyze an erase (or trap the filesystem using a remote debugger or a SATA drive that logs commands) to be sure.\nEither way, at the end of the erase process, you get an email, so when you send an erase, you'll know when it started and when it finished and can conclude which erase actually happened.\nIn your case, your Mac probably received the erase command nearly instantly, so you can now perform a single pass zero (assuming you aren't going to send in the drive for data recovery) and time that to compare with Apple's erase. A seven pass erase is basically seven times as long as a one pass erase so the timings should be easily observable to deduce the type and number of passes.\n", "Q: Can't I resize my existing partition?

I swear I've done this before, but either I am forgetting something or the behavior of iTunes 11 changed:\nIn the past I've only kept about a dozen or so albums on my local (work) computer, but I have networked storage containing my whole music collection. If I connected to the networked drive and copied albums into iTunes, the albums would appear in iTunes but remain on networked storage. When I left my local network, the networked music would still appear, but there was an icon (red x?) to indicate that it was offline. When I reconnected at home, the icons disappear and I can play the networked music again.\nNow in iTunes 11, when I drag music from networked storage to my library, iTunes makes a local copy of it in the iTunes music folder instead of just linking to the networked file. Can anyone comment on what's happening? \nThanks!\n\nA: Whether to copy is a setting in iTunes. On the OS-X version of iTunes, under preferences -> Advanced, make sure \"Copy files to iTunes Media folder when adding...\" is not checked.\n", "Q: Macbook Air short Battery Life I purchased Macbook Air 13 in late 2012. It is advertised as having 7 hour battery life. After a few months of use, with maximum charge it gives me only 2 hours. \nIs this normal?\n\nA: If you're not using a lot of power, this isn't normal. On http://www.apple.com/macbookair/features.html#battery it says up to 7 hours, clearly implying that you could get less. The footnote as text as follows:\n\nThe wireless web test measures battery life by wirelessly browsing 25\n  popular websites with display brightness set to 50%. The standby test\n  measures battery life by allowing a system, connected to a wireless\n  network, to enter standby mode with Safari and Mail applications\n  launched and all system settings left at default. Battery life varies\n  by use and configuration.\n\nSo, if you had all of the the brightness on max, CPU topped out, GPU working and storage downloading, I would expect the battery to last between 2 and 3 hours, so you may have a perfectly normal battery or there may be an issue. This sort of thing is exactly what the Genius bar and AppleCare exist to answer on a case by case basis if the online tips don't work or you want to seek a professional opinion and possible repair. \n\nA: I would download and install Battery Health from the Mac App Store. Allow it to run and determine if your battery's current maximum charge threshold.\nIn the case that your battery is no longer charging to its maximum amount, I would make an appointment with your local Genius Bar for some in-warranty love.\nIf your battery is \"just fine\", you'll want to consider lowering your screen's brightness, reducing the number of open apps and potentially uninstalling Flash, turning off Bluetooth if you don't use it, and making sure your GPU and CPU power settings are enabled.\n\nA: \"Extend the battery life of your MacBook, no matter how old it is\" written on June 22nd 2013 by G. Goetz for Gigaom.com, gives a useful insight into what can be done to preserve or possibly extend the battery life of your Macbook Air including:\n\n\n*\n\n*Checking the condition of your battery\n\n*Determining your battery’s cycle count\n\n*Using a better battery monitoring utility\n\n*Turning off the screen saver\n\n\nEdit\nAdditionally \"What happens to your Macbook Air battery in a year\" written on 15th August 2013 by L. Hockenson may also provide useful insight.\n", "Q: RAM upgrade – iMac Mid 2011 I’ve got an iMac Mid 2011 with 4GB RAM preinstalled (2 x 2GB) and want to upgrade to 12GB.\nIs it ok to add a single 8GB RAM or is it better to add 2 x 4GB?\n\nA: Single DIMMs might not be supported, depending on the model of iMac you have. According to this Apple KB:\n\nAdditional notes i5 and i7 Quad Core iMac computers come with both top memory slots populated. These computers will not start up if only\n  a single DIMM is installed in any bottom slot; these computers should\n  operate normally with a single DIMM installed in any top slot. Core\n  Duo iMac computers should operate normally with a single DIMM\n  installed in any slot, top or bottom. (\"Top\" and \"bottom\" slots refer\n  to the orientation of the slots in the pictures below. \"Top\" refers to\n  the slots closest to the display; \"bottom\" refers to the slots closest\n  to the stand)\n\nAs a side note, 8GB DIMMS are not officially supported - only 2 or 4 GB SO-DIMMs. However, according to this OWC page, 8GB DIMMs do work (4 x 8GB).\n", "Q: Mail.app mailbox corruption Once a week or so, Mail.app will not display the contents of a mail message. Selecting Mailbox -> Rebuild fixes bandaids the issue until next time.\nI only have one account in Mail.app, pointing to a Microsoft hosted Exchange server. This has happened consistently for the past 3 months.\nWhat information would help to solve this problem, or what is a solution to this problem?\n\nA: You could try deleting the \"Envelope Index\" files.\nRun the following Terminal commands to backup and delete the files:\ncd ~/Library/Mail/V2/\ncp MailData MailData.old\ncd MailData\nrm Envelope\\ Index Envelope\\ Index-shm Envelope\\ Index-wal\n\nAlternatively…\n\n\n*\n\n*Quit Mail\n\n*In Finder, press ⌘ cmd+⇧ shift+G\nCopy and paste the following  \n~/Library/Mail/V2/MailData/\n\nPress return or click Go\n\n*Backup then delete/move these files to the Trash:\n\n\n*\n\n*Envelope Index  \n\n*Envelope Index-shm  \n\n*Envelope Index-wal\n\n\n*Relaunch Mail and wait for messages to import.\nNote: once in a while this causes a corrupted message or two to reveal itself, usually in the form of having no \"From\" or \"Subject\" in the list view of messages (at least in \"Classic Layout\" mode).\nSometimes a corrupted message can actually screw up the interaction between Mail and the server, even if message is corrupted not on Mac, but on the server itself! (seen happen w/ AOL).\n", "Q: Is line level Bluetooth audio possible with iPhone? In my car i have a 3.5mm jack that I want to connect to my iPhone 5. I currently am just running a standard 3.5mm cable from my phone to the port, but that audio volume isn't that great. So I thought a neat way would be to get a Bluetooth module with a 3.5mm input - like this one and use that. \nBut I'm not sure if that would connect via a line level output from the phone.\nIs is possible to do line level out without needing an expensive lighting to 30 pin cable -> 30 pin to 3.5mm cable into the car port?\nOR is it possible to just go lighting cable to this, right into the 3.5mm jack, would it carry audio???\n(there was a goo.gl link here but it led to a 404 or I removed it)\n\nA: You'll want something like the Griffin BlueTrip Aux as it gets powered from a DC car jack (a.k.a cigarette lighter recepticle) and receives bluetooth music and sends it out a stereo analog connector to your car's AUX in / line in headphone jack.\nThere are many similar products that are cheaper and larger and the audio quality on some is not as good as Griffin's product, but you can shop around since there are several similar product on the market.\nThe part you list needs a USB cable and getting that out of a lightning port phone would be far more product than a simple BT receiver.\n", "Q: Can't shuffle playlists and then sync that shuffled playlist to my iPod Can't shuffle playlists and then sync that shuffled playlist to my iPod. I was able to do this in the previous versions of itunes just by clicking a button. That button is not there anymore. How can I shuffle specific playlists and have that shuffled list transfer to my iPod in the shuffled order?\n\nA: I'm having the same problem and I've looked at other websites and it seems that no one can a figure out a way to do it. I think the only option we have is to write to Apple and ask that they bring the feature back. \nhttp://apple.com/feedback/\nI already did that and I hope you will too.\n", "Q: SSH to localhost on OS X Mountain Lion fails with invalid password (after reinstall & migration) After reinstalling OS X, then migrating my account over via Time Machine, I cannot ssh to localhost.

I've just bought my first Mac, a Macbook pro(with an hdd), and I'm thinking in buying an ssd and replace the hdd. But the computer came with no dvd of the OS. I know that in the hdd there is a restore partition, but if I remove the hdd, how can I install the OS?\n\nA: You can create your own recovery disk with Recovery Disk Assistant and a blank USB drive that is at least 1 GB. Alternatively, your Mac can boot into OS X Internet Recovery mode in which it downloads an image from Apple's servers, and it can do this with a damaged recovery partition or even a blank hard drive -- it's built into the firmware of the system. To access it, boot up while holding Command + R. You can do this over a wireless network that is either unprotected or WPA-secured, or you can use an Ethernet connection. In both cases, your system will need to download OS X from Apple (the recovery partition does not contain a full OS X.)\n", "Q: Keyboard shortcut for current window position I am looking for the keyboard shortcut to place the current window in half of the screen, either to the left or right.

It's convenient to use dd to write image file to USB sticks.

Upon unlocking screen Adium logs back in.  \nIt used to just set to away when screen locked and I have pushover scripts that rely on this.    \nHow can I get it to behave the way it did before I upgraded?\n\nA: That behavior is determined by the settings in the Status pane of Adium preferences.  Specifically, it's determined by the \"When Screen Saver is activated, set:\" preference.  Check to make sure that's not set to \"Offline\".\n\n\nA: I believe this is because of \"Wake on Demand\" feature in OSX 10.8.

When you send an SMS message to a turned off iPhone then check say an hour later and the SEND button is blue, does that mean the user at some point has switched on to check messages? Cause I tried to resend as iMessage and it went green again?\n\nA: If the recipient's iMessage is unavailable, or yours, for that matter, the Send button will be turned to Green, showing that you'll send a SMS. When the iMessage service is available again, the button will be turned Blue, showing that you'll be sending iMessages instead of SMS.\nSo, if you want to make sure you'll always be sending an iMessage, although the service is unavailable, meaning that the recipient will receive the text whenever it's possible, just switch off the Send as SMS under Settings / Messages.\n", "Q: What causes a Mac to lose its serial number?

This machine is able to log in to Messsages.\n\nA: TUAW has an article on this problem, the author had his logic board replaced and apple did not reset the serial number. In essence he did software trouble shooting, reinstalled the os.... at some point he realized he did not have his serial number. As per a comment Apple or an authorize service providers have software that is able to reapply  serial numbers and he was able to connect with messages. The link to the story is below.\nhttp://www.tuaw.com/2013/01/14/if-messages-on-os-x-cant-connect-check-your-serial-number/\n\nA: My girlfriend's 2009 white MacBook lost it's serial number after upgrading to OS X El Capitan. Didn't realise this until it refused to log in to iCloud, AppStore etc. and started digging around. \nI can say that even though Apple won't admit or explain why this happens, I know every change made to this machine. After 4 months the keyboard became buggy and would randomly lock the RETURN key in repeat. They changed the logic board under warranty and it's been fine since. I suspect this is the cause. \nI have added more RAM myself (Approved Kingston RAM, but not from Apple), and I've recently replaced the HDD with an SSD. However I have done this to several different macs without issues, so I suspect that the logic board replacement was the cause. \nWhat was worse? We had the rubber base replaced under warranty (Apple admitted there were manufacturing issues where it would start to peel off) but of course the replacement base was without a serial number printed on it! By a stroke of luck and several hours of searching I found the support case online for the machine and luckily the serial number was registered there! Phew - we almost lost a perfectly good Mac's ability to use iCloud/App Store to this issue! And with no serial on the machine (and probably the wrong one/none on the new logic board) Apple had kind of screwed us there. I'm going to rewrite the serial number to the firmware tonight and cross my fingers that it works!\nUPDATE Blank Board Serializer did the job. Burned to a CD and booted, entered the correct Serial Number, and now iCloud, App Store etc. all logs in correctly.\n\nA: A lack of a visible serial number should not affect your Mac.\nApple does not guarantee a serial number will be set. Technical Note 1103 warns developers not to rely on a serial number being available to uniquely identify a Mac.\nThe technical note suggests the serial number can vanish if hardware components are changed. Other reasons appear to be possible but Apple does not enumerate every cause:\n\nCaveats for using the serial number\nIt is possible for a system to lose its serial number so that it will no longer appear either in System Profiler or the I/O Registry. Repairing a system by swapping hardware components is one reason this can happen. Apple does not document the specific details of how a machine can lose its serial number. Once the serial number has been lost there is no means to restore it to the machine.\nApple does not guarantee that all future systems will have a software-readable serial number.\nBoth of these cases illustrate why asset tracking software should always provide a way for a serial number to be entered manually.\n\nI am not aware of any further documentation about restoring the serial number. If it is possible, this capability is likely to only be available to Apple engineers or support staff.\n\nA: The logic board should carry the serial number, so the logical and most likely conclusion would be software corruption or perhaps a failure of the logic board.\nCheck in terminal to see if the system information is truly missing:\nsystem_profiler SPHardwareDataType\n\nTowards the end of this listing should be a serial number field. Based on this result, you might reinstall the OS (if the serial shows under this command) - and even if this serial were missing, I might still try a reinstallation before taking it in for service. If you are close to a free service like a Genius Bar, you might stop in with the Mini (no need for cables) and ask if they can have a brief look. They'll tell you if you need to remove the RAM/HD or if they can determine the issue / quote a possible repair if it's not software.\nThe more I think about this, I wonder if the Mac ever had a serial number written to the logic board. I would open a support case (worldwide contact for Apple support here) and get it on the record as needing repair even if you aren't keen to send it in now. The sooner you report something, the more options you have. \nNormally, nothing ever fails since most software never reads the number, but it would be nice to have everything working on a Machine that is still under the one year warranty. \n\nA: Use Blank Board Serializer\nSee http://rogersm.net/icloud-problems-mountain-lion-serial-number for a solution.\nBe sure to follow the instructions faithfully.\n", "Q: When using Mail with Gmail IMAP, how to move emails to different folders and not label them? I'm using Mac Lion Mail app with Gmail IMAP and when I drag and drop or command-click to move messages from my Inbox to a folder called Personal, it appears to work in Mail.  But when I look at Gmail, the message remains in Inbox.  Instead of actually moving the message, it simply gives it the label, Personal.  \nIn Gmail, I never label anything, I always move messages to various folders and I want to mimic this behaviour in Mail app.  How can I do this?\n\nA: Gmail has a guide on how actions on IMAP clients correspond to Gmail actions. In order to remove items from your inbox in Gmail, you will need to delete them from your inbox in Mail.app -- this will \"archive\" the message in Gmail rather than moving it to the trash. The trouble with this is that emails that you move to a folder in Mail.app probably won't show up in your Mail.app inbox until you refresh it, so it may take a few steps to move and archive a message. Unfortunately, Gmail behaves so differently from normal mail services that using it with a standard IMAP client tends to be a pain. However, the reference in the link above should help you figure out which actions in Mail.app correspond to various Gmail actions.\n\nA: I find that clicking on the folder you just moved messages to in Mail will then remove them from the Inbox. Its weird, its as if the re-downloading of the message in the folder you moved them to, kicks off the actual move in Gmail. \n", "Q: How can Apple Mail be configured to mimic Gmail's \"Archiving\" behaviour for a generic IMAP account? It is straightforward to configure a Gmail account being accessed through Apple Mail to Archive messages when you \"delete\" them from the mail client. With generic IMAP accounts, however, the only options for deleting messages are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Move deleted messages to the Trash mailbox (which, when unchecked, leaves them in the Inbox)\n\n*Store deleted messages on the server (which, when unchecked, stores them in the local mailbox only, I suppose)\n\n*Permanently erase deleted messages when <time interval>...\n\n\nIs there a way, through a combination of server configuration and, perhaps, Apple Mail rules, to move messages to an IMAP \"archive\" folder when I Trash them?\n(I note that there seems to exist no condition in Apple Mail's rules to take action when a message is deleted...)\n\nA: Mail does have an action called \"Archive\" in the Message menu that moves the current message in to  a directory called \"Archive.\"  I use it all day every day on my work IMAP account just like in Gmail.  I stash everything in there and just rely on search to find what I need.  It works great.\nI don't think there's a way to remap the Delete key to perform an Archive action instead, but Archive does have a keyboard shortcut: control-command-A.  If you find that as clunky as I do, you can remap it in System Preferences' Keyboard pane.\n\nYou can also add Archive to your toolbar if that's more your thing.\n\nA: This should work, though I'm afraid to try this myself— perhaps try it with a spam or test mail account first:\n\n\n*\n\n*In Mail, set the option Permanently erase deleted messages when to Never, and be certain to check for any similar option in your IMAP settings\n\n*In your IMAP settings, create a folder called Archives, then synchronize Mail\n\n*When Archives appears in Mail's list of mailboxes select it, then go to the menu item Mailbox > Use this mailbox for > Trash\nThat should move everything that you delete from Mail using the delete key to your IMAP Archives. However! Naturally if you select Empty Trash or hit ⌘ + ⇧ + ⌫ while in Mail then all of your Archives may be deleted from your IMAP account!  \n", "Q: In iTunes 11, is it possible to show the genre of an album in Artist view? In iTunes 11 I use the artist view. In artist view, I see the artists on the very left, then the album covers and the track multi-columned at the right side of the cover. Is it possible to also show the genre of the album?\nThe only way I know to access the genre is to right-click the cover or a track, open \"information\" and look at \"Genre\".\n\nA: Short answer: NO\nApple has custom view options screens for Artist, Albums, Genres views and therefore you cannot change the columns beyond what they allow. It seems it is only available in song and playlist view. \nI am guessing the reason for this is that the artist view is meant to group and display a specific set of data. I would suspect in future versions they may introduce the ability to do this, however for the moment it is not possible.\nSidenote: The View Options screen has been drastically modified for the song view compared to the previous version.\n", "Q: Apple Mail 6.2 - Turn OFF automatic checking for new messages Well I am very disappointed with Apple Mail. Its checking for new e-mails automatically from time to time regardless the options. \n\n\n*\n\n*In General options I set \"Check for new messages\" to \"Manually\"\n\n*In each e-mail account I turned off the option \"Include when automatically checking for new messages\"\n\n*In each IMAP account i turned off the option \"Use IDLE command when server supports it\"\n\n\nMail still downloads new e-mails from time to time. \nAny tips how to finally turn this OFF? Thank you\n\nA: I believe that the most effective way to accomplish this is in the \"Mailbox\" menu. Choose \"Take all accounts offline\" and you should be set. Let me know if it isn't what you want.\n\nA: I think by design when you open a mail box it is gonna check for new mail when you open it. ( or even when you open the app and open another mailbox not sure )\nTo turn checking of those accounts really off you need to uncheck \"Enable this account\"\n\nBut then you won't be able to to access the disabled accounts not sure if that's what your looking for.\nMaybe a better option is to move to a different email client? or at least those accounts you don't want to check?

My wife correctly received the invitation/notification. \nShe could open this shared photos on her iPhone 4 (iOS6) but it's seems not working on her iPad (1st gen / iOS5).\nHow can I make it work?\n\nA: Short Answer: You can't\nShared PhotoStream is a feature of iOS 6 and therefore not available on iOS 5. Some users claim they had gotten the feature working and enabled by removing and re-adding the iCloud account, however I have never seen it work.\nFrom the official description of a shared PhotoStream (Bold by me):\n\nSelect photos directly from the Photos app in iOS 6, iPhoto or Aperture on a Mac\n\n", "Q: Use iOS twitter integration without the official Twitter app? Is it possible to keep the full iOS twitter integration (tweet from anywhere in iOS, get notified on lockscreen/notification center etc.) and uninstall the official Twitter client and use TweetBot or Twitteriffic instead?\n\nA: I found out recently in iOS 6 you don't need the official Twitter client installed nor the Facebook client. I use Tweetbot for Twitter, and I am still able to use the built in Twitter features for iOS without having reinstalled the official Twitter app.\nNotifications are generally handled by the individual applications through the notification centre and therefore you don't need the twitter client installed, since your preferred client will handle these.\nIt seems that the link for this in the settings page is only to make you aware that you need another client to read actual Twitter/Facebook messages and to get all functionality.\niOS provides native authentication and tweeting functionality. The reason for the recommendation to install the twitter app is due to the fact that iOS does not support reading tweets or notifications natively.\nI found this out by accident setting up my iPhone 5. I have since removed the official app from my iPad HD and everything still works.\n", "Q: External monitor viewport appear shrunk in native resolution on MBP I am using Mountain Lion on my MBP, my external TFT monitor used to work great at its native resolution (1920x1080) when connected to the MBP.\nHowever today after shutting it down and powering it up the resolution on the external monitor was on 800x600. In system preferences the 'Best for Display' resolution output was selected (wasn't that supposed to be 1920x1080?) when I clicked 'Scaled' and chose 1920x1080 the resolution indeed changed, however it is not taking up the whole screen. There are 1 inches to the left and right of the monitor that are not being used. Its as if the viewport is \"shrinked\".\nI tried downloading SwitchResX but it did not help, when choosing 1920x1080 again the viewport is missing about an inch to the left and right.\nAny thoughts?\n\nA: I had precisely the same issue, and so did this poster:\nExternal monitor randomly lowers resolution adds black borders\nthe answer in both cases was to switch out the VGA cable.\n\nA: If it once worked and from out of nowhere it doesn't, go to System Preferences -> Display\nIn the Display tab hit the \"Detect Displays\" button. If you can't find this button, hit the ⌥ key (then the Gather Windows button will change to Detect Display - this is btw the most stupid GUI flaw I've ever seen). \nThis should fix your problem.\nIf it doesn't check your monitor's firmware settings (and maybe try to recalibrate it).\n", "Q: Is it good for performance to sleep a Mac rather than shut it down? OSX Mountain Lion, Mid 2012 13\" MacBook Pro.\nI'd like to know what is the best practices about closing the Macbook Pro lid (sleeping) verses shutting it down?\nI often simply close it during the night, leading to long uptimes (4 days right now).\nSometimes I feel it's not as snappy as it is when I rebooted it a few minutes ago.\nShould I shut it down when I don't use it for 3+ hours for example? Will it help it lasting longer or am I being paranoid?\n\nA: A long uptime is four days? My MBP has uptimes of weeks. Not as snappy? I guess you're running out of memory or something else is wrong. \nI've never had this issue where the machine is not as responsive after closing the lid as opposed to rebooting. I generally only reboot because of WiFi connection problems or software updates.\nTo answer your question - just close the lid. Only reboot when necessary.\nWhen closing the lid it goes into a sleep state which I think is very nice because when you open the lid it is almost instantly awake and ready to be used. While if you power it off it will take some moments to be booted.\nYou could leave the lid open as well if you like. The fist thing that is probably is gonna fail is the battery. To keep that in good condition make sure you keep your battery charged (there are other topics about this how to do this and what is the best).\nIn the end, the machine is built to be used and you should just enjoy using it without thinking to much about what is best. Apple already has that done for you :).\n\nA: Closing the lid or not is all about dust, cat hair, protection. You could leave the computer opened for its entire life with no issue at all (as my wife seems to do). I close mine when I'm not using it for a while because we heat with a wood stove and have quite a bit of dust in our house.\nIt's not a bad idea to restart your computer from time to time although multiple times a day seems a bit too much to me.\nWhy not restart once a day, right after you do a complete backup. You are backing up daily, right? If you're paranoid, this is the area you should be focusing on.\n", "Q: How to control brightness on external late 2009 iMac monitor when connected to new 2012 iMac primary monitor?

According to the description it \"Works with any Mac computer that supports 4GB DDR3 SODIMMs\". My MacBook supports 6GB officially and 8GB with the firmware that I am running.\nHowever when I inserted my MacBook sounded three beeps at start-up. I tried inserting only one stick in both of the slots but that didn't help. I also tried it with both sticks but that does not work either.\nWhen I plugged in my old RAM it worked perfectly. I also tried another 8GB RAM stick from Crucial with the same specs (CT2CP51264BC1067) and it also worked as expected. \nI tried the 2x4GB sticks with my HP laptop (dv6) but I got a blue-screen when booting  with the messag IRQL NOT LESS OR EQUAL‎. The 8GB Crucial RAM works fine in the HP so there must be something wrong with the 2x4GB sticks\nHas any of you experienced a similar issue? Is there anything I can do? I already tried PRAM reset. \nUnfortunately I cannot return it as I am not in the US anymore.\n\nA: 3 beeps indicate that the RAM didn't pass the system test. As the 2x4GB Corsair RAM also gives you a Blue Screen Of Death on your HP I would say that the RAM is faulty and your only option is to return it.\nTry shipping it to a friend in the US or to Amazon.com directly as you're not in the US anymore.\n\nA: I have the same problem, I just bought a 2x4go Corsair Kit (Mac Memory DDR3 SoDIMM, PC-8500 1066 Mhz CMSA8GX3M2A1066C7) for my late 2008 Macbook.\nI have the latest firmware and OS needed for the upgrade but when I installed it and tried to boot my mac: black screen and awful BEEP, BEEP, BEEP (my heart skipped a beat at that moment). I took them out, put them back in case I did it wrong the first time. Nothing. Put the old RAM in and it's working again.\nI wasn't keen on buying Corsair RAM because of all the bad reviews I read but they were the only 8go available. I'll get them refund, I don't want something unreliable that's going to fail me in 3 or 6 months. \nSame RAM and we have the same issues. So I guess these definitely have some technical problems. \nSo far, from all the reviews I've read the one that have the less negative comments are G.Skill and OWC (but they're not the biggest manufacturers either), then it's Crucial and Kingston (1 on 20). And last Corsair (1 on 10). And read lots of comments saying to avoid \"value\" RAM as well.\nCorsair RAM have lifetime garantee for these (or maybe not... but it goes from 2 years to a lifetime) get in contact with Corsair (website), you'll probably be able to get a refund or an exchange directly.\n\nA: If I recall correctly, the 2008 MacBooks ran DDR2 RAM, not DDR3. The pin configuration is physically different between the two.\nTo be sure, you can remove one of the current sticks and hold it up next to a new stick. The notch on the pin side should be in a different spot. \nI'd bet you got the beeps because you were not able to seat the sticks all the way in. Had you, you could have damaged your memory controller.\n", "Q: Apple Automator Question Copy and Paste How would I copy all of the text from a powerpoint presentation and paste it into a word document?\n\nA: Simple.

I had an iPhone 4 stolen from me and there is an associated iCloud backup with tons of data I want. Is there any possible way to access this without the iPhone 4?\nI also got an iPhone 5 recently but don't think the restore will work (but haven't tried).\n\nA: Apple doesn't expose iCloud backups directly to end users via computer or web interface, but you can restore that backup onto pretty much any other iOS device.\nThe new iPhone (or any iOS device for that matter) has iOS version the same or newer than the version backed up from the stolen phone. Simply erase all content on the current device (losing everything in it) and restore your old backup onto the device. \nHopefully, have not \"created\" much new data on your new phone and don't have to write down many new contacts or items or export any documents before you erase it. However, you could always back that device up to the same or different iCloud account or to iTunes and restore that once you've gotten your data to a more portable form.\n\nA: The prior answer isn't true.

It restarted fine and then worked for another few days before it did it again.\nToday it shut down and will not turn back on. Once its shut down the battery no longer charges. \nAny ideas what could have gone wrong?\n\nA: If the LED does not illuminate, then you have a hardware failure that could be as simple as needing to take the battery out and run without.\nAll unibody Mac with built-in batteries have very delicate cells, so use great care to avoid puncturing them - even when discharged, you could start a fire.\nYou could take it in for service or try a DIY repair, and as long as you don't leave any small debris between the battery and the case (and ensure nothing is left inside the case that fits that description), the skilled DIYer can easily exchange the battery.\nDepending on your budget, you might delay buying a battery and have it serviced to see if there isn't a different failure of the charging system or the computer itself that caused a dead battery or will prevent operation even with a good battery.\nI'd take it in for service unless you have a high interest in learning or there really are no good options where you could mail or take it directly. Apple should be able to quote you a cost to repair the battery in a mail in service and you can decide from there whether to seek other quotes or have them work on it with the expectation that you'll pay for a battery or get a call if the repair costs more than quoted. At that point you can decide to go ahead or not, but if it's just a battery, you'll end up paying for the service and get a 90 day warranty on the machine and the work.\n", "Q: Sublime Text 2 in OSX: all fonts are bold regardless of theme or font I have a weird problem on mac (OSX 10.7): any theme or font I choose - all fonts appear in bold.

Thanks!\n\nA: Hm, I've run a similar script in AppleScript Editor but it works ok for me:\nset contractsPath to \"/Users/subhu/Test test test/\"\ndo shell script \"ln -s \" & quoted form of the POSIX path of contractsPath & \" ~/Desktop/test\"\n\nNote that, if you escaping a backslash with another backslash you have to use just contractsPath, not quoted form of the POSIX path of contractsPath, e.g.:\nset contractsPath to \"/Users/subhu/Test\\\\ test\\\\ test\"\ndo shell script \"ln -s \" & contractsPath & \" ~/Desktop/test\"\n\nTry it.\n\nA: contractsPath is already a posix path. Try: \ndo shell script \"ln -s \" & quoted form of contractsPath & \" ~/Desktop/Contracts\"\n", "Q: Mac Air OS X Mountain Lion - mounting NFS \"dscl\" freezes system permanently I set out to execute the following steps on OS X Mountain Lion to mount an NFS share- \ncreate\nsudo dscl . -create /Mounts/foo\nsudo dscl . -create /Mounts/foo VFSLinkDir /Volumes/share\nsudo dscl . -create /Mounts/foo VFSOpts resvport ro nosuid\nsudo dscl . -create /Mounts/foo VFSType nfs\nsudo dscl . -create /Mounts/foo RecordName nfs.example.com:/srv/share\n\nverify\nsudo dscl . -list /Mounts\nsudo dscl . -read /Mounts/nfs.example.com:/srv/share\n\nAfter creating, when I tried to list the mounts, my mac air stopped responding. On restart, when I log on to my account, it freezes on a finder window without loading anything else. I can't seem to kill it or start task manager or do anything else. \nI can log on to the guest account but not with my own account.\n\nA: When you ask to mount an NFS volume this way, \"hard\"(the default), the computer will try to mount the volume and keep trying (to the exclusion of all else) because it thinks that this volume is critical for system operation.  You need to tell the computer that this volume is not needed to run the system.  The way you do this is to tell it to mount \"soft\".  While you at it, it helps to include the \"intr\" option (Allow signals to interrupt an NFS call. Useful for aborting when the server doesn't respond).\nSo in your command above you need to add soft and intr, like this:\nsudo dscl . -create /Mounts/foo VFSOpts resvport intr soft ro nosuid \n\nYou may want to explore these options too, depending on your application they may be useful:\nnolocks locallocks wsize=32768 rsize=32768 timeo=900 retrans=3 proto=tcp nfc\n\nFinally, you may be missing a RecordType declaration.  I'm not sure if this is created automatically for you, if it is not already there add it by:\nsudo dscl . -create /Mounts/foo RecordType dsRecTypeStandard:Mounts\n\nGood luck.\n", "Q: Time Machine — ‘Sparsebundle already in use’ error A few days ago, Time Machine on my Mac reported an error: ‘Sparsebundle already in use’. Manual unmount of the Time Capsule didn't help, nor a reboot of my machine. Removing and re-selecting my Time Capsule from the Time Machine Preferences window didn't help either. \n\nA: After some research, I found the answer was pretty straightforward, though not obvious. As the error message hints, the problem is that the disk mount utility believes that there is already a user connected to the disk. To solve that, you can use a handy function present in Airport Utility 5.6 (but not in Airport Utility 6.1), named ‘disconnect all users’: \n\n\n*\n\n*Open the Time Capsule pane by double-clicking on the Time Capsule item in the left list. \n\n*Select the ‘Disks’ tab. \n\n*Press the button ‘Disconnect all users…’ \n\n\nIf you don't have the Airport Utility 5.6, you can either download it from Apple's KB (if you're on Mountain Lion you'll also need the Pacifist app to extract the app from the package) or just use your Airport Utility 6.1 to reboot the device. \n", "Q: iPhone showing reminders, but I have none My Reminders app is showing 6 reminders, but as far as I know, I have none. I've checked the completed file, checked in iCal on the Mac. Any ideas how to delete these reminders?\n\nA: When you open the Reminders app, make sure there isn't anything set in both Reminders and Tasks.\nYou may have created a Task using Siri, or another app by accident. And as a result of the way the app is setup on the iPhone, it doesn't default to showing you both Reminders and Tasks at the same time.\nOn the iPhone try the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open up the Reminders app\n\n*Tap near the bottom of the screen (you should see other white tabs)\n\n*Tap on whichever tab is not active (most likely Tasks)\n\n*If there are any items listed there, check them off by tapping the circles next to the name\n\n\nOn the Mac try the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open up the Reminders app\n\n*Ensure sidebar is visible by going to View > Show Sidebar in the top Menu Bar\n\n*Click on all of the different options in the sidebar (Today, Reminders, Tasks, etc)\n\n*If there are any items listed there, check them off by clicking the circles next to the name\n\n\nA: I've had this issue before.  Turn off all reminders and turn them back on to reset the reminder data.\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Settings - Mail, Contacts, Calendars.\n\n*For each listed account, select it and switch Reminders to OFF.\n\n*Restart your iPhone for good measure.\n\n*Go to Settings - Mail, Contacts, Calendars.\n\n*for each desired account, select it and switch Reminders to ON.\n\n\nA: I’ve found that Reminders sync in iOS can be pretty flaky. Especially after a reboot, they usually stop syncing down.\nWhat I do is create a dummy reminder on my iPhone or iPad, then wait for it to upload. Within a few seconds, the app should pull down its correct state, and update accordingly.\n", "Q: Erase MacBook hard drive without OSX disc I would like to erase everything on my Mac's hard drive as I'm going to recycle or sell it. Is there a way to do it without OSX disc?\n\nA: Target Disk Mode\nIf the Mac you want to erase supports Target Disk Mode, and you have a second compatible Mac (you need to use either Firewire or Thunderbolt on both), you can use the second Mac to erase the target one. Boot up into Target Disk Mode (hold down T), and the target Mac will appear as an external drive on the second Mac. Then you can run Disk Utility to wipe the drives as per usual.\nDBAN\nIf you can't use Target Disk Mode, you can download DBAN and burn it to a DVD. Boot up using the DVD and you'll be presented with a multitude of options for wiping the drive.\nExtract the Hard Drive\nThe last resort is to open up the Mac and extract the hard drive. You can then use a SATA dock or enclosure to attach it to another computer and wipe it using the tools available (Disk Utility on the Mac, or other tools on Windows). With the exception of the MacBook Air and Retina MacBook Pro, all MacBooks have standard 2.5\" SATA drives, so any enclosure that takes SATA will be compatible.\n\nA: Download GParted and boot from cd or usb stick (by holding down the key Option immediately after chime sounds at startup).  You can do pretty much anything you want to your drive with GParted.\n", "Q: What is causing this kernel panic? nterval Since Last Panic Report:  835635 sec\nPanics Since Last Report:

but inevitably caused by either hardware problems or rogue kernel extensions--specifically drivers. Panic reports list all the loaded and unloaded extensions in the expectation that the culprit is a non-Apple driver. \nIn your case, there are two: one for PdaNet and one for DisplayLink. A web search revealed no complaints about the DisplayLink driver's behavior, but the same could not be said for the one from PDANet; it shows up in a large number of KP reports.\nI downloaded the PDANet desktop application (iPhone model, version 1.0.64). Glancing through an ASCII dump of the com.jft.driver.PdaNetDrv extension discloses it was built using a 10.6 SDK, so it's quite possible, if not likely, the driver is incompatible with Mountain Lion.\nI suggest uninstalling the PDANet application and the driver extension. You should have gotten an uninstall shell script with the installation package which will remove the driver; if not, contact June Fabrics and request one. Simply removing the application will not do the job.\nIf the panics stop occurring, let a few days go by before you consider the problem solved. It could just be a coincidence, and if another one occurs, you would then almost certainly be looking at a hardware issue.\n\nA: Put in the first Mac OS install disk and reboot holding the D key down. This will cause Hardware test to run. It will test all the hardware. This panic looks like a ram issue. All the numbers are memory address. Most likely you have a ram stick that went bad. \n", "Q: Create playlists for full albums in iTunes (i.e. albums with all songs) How could I create playlists for all of the albums in iTunes for which I have all of the songs?

Here is one approach:\n-- Creates a playlist for each full album you have in iTunes\n-- Set the playlistPrefix and playlistSuffix as desired before running\n\n-- Based on code by Brad Campbell\n-- http://www.bradcampbell.com/2009/05/26/make-a-whole-album-playlist-in-itunes/\n\ntell application \"iTunes\"\n    set playlistPrefix to \"FA: \"\n    set playlistSuffix to \"\"\n    -- The \"FA: \" prefix will help cluster full albums in iTunes' playlists,\n    -- and is narrow enough to not get in your way when viewing on an iPhone\n\n    set albumBuckets to {} as list\n    set allSongs to (every track of library playlist 1 whose enabled is true and podcast is false and kind contains \"audio\") as list\n\n    -- Find all partial albums in iTunes\n    repeat with currentTrack in allSongs\n        set albumName to album of currentTrack as text\n        set artistName to artist of currentTrack as text\n\n        -- First check for missing values, then perform integer comparison\n        -- Zero is on the left to force interger type coercion, just in case\n        if album of currentTrack is not missing value and 0 is less than length of albumName then\n            if artist of currentTrack is not missing value and 0 is less than length of artistName then\n                if track number of currentTrack is not missing value and 0 is less than track number of currentTrack then\n                    if track count of currentTrack is not missing value and 0 is less than track count of currentTrack then\n                        if albumBuckets does not contain album of currentTrack then\n                            copy album of currentTrack to the end of albumBuckets\n                        end if\n                    end if\n                end if\n            end if\n        end if\n\n    end repeat\n\n    repeat with currentAlbum in albumBuckets\n        set albumSongs to (every track of library playlist 1 whose album is currentAlbum)\n        set firstTrack to first item of albumSongs\n\n        -- Filter album list to act only on full albums\n        if (count of albumSongs) is equal to track count of first item of albumSongs and 1 is less than (count of albumSongs) then\n            -- This is a full album, construct the playlist\n\n            -- Sort tracks by track number\n            set albumSongsSorted to {} as list\n            repeat with i from 1 to (count of albumSongs)\n                repeat with trk in albumSongs\n                    if track number of trk is i then\n                        set nextSong to trk\n                        copy nextSong to the end of albumSongsSorted\n                    end if\n                end repeat\n            end repeat\n\n            -- Don't show artist name for compilations\n            if firstTrack is not compilation then\n                set playlistNameArtist to artist of firstTrack & \" - \"\n            else\n                set playlistNameArtist to \"\"\n            end if\n\n            set albumPlaylistName to playlistPrefix & playlistNameArtist & currentAlbum & playlistSuffix\n\n            -- Create playlist\n            if user playlist albumPlaylistName exists then\n                try\n                    delete tracks of user playlist albumPlaylistName\n                end try\n            else\n                make new user playlist with properties {name:albumPlaylistName}\n            end if\n\n            try\n                repeat with trk in albumSongsSorted\n                    duplicate trk to user playlist albumPlaylistName\n                end repeat\n            end try\n        end if\n    end repeat\n\n    display dialog \"Playlists created! Check iTunes for playlists beginning with '\" & playlistPrefix & \"'\"\nend tell\n\nTo try this out, just copy and paste the code block into AppleScript Editor and push Run. Do be aware there's no easy \"undo\" button - you'll have to just hold down the delete key if you want to ditch all the created playlists.\nThere's probably a faster algorithm (i.e. one that makes only a single pass through iTunes' library) but I couldn't figure how to work with two dimensional variables in AppleScript, which seems like a prerequisite.\nA bonus side effect of this script is that it may surface ancient albums in your library you have moved on from and can safely delete :)\n", "Q: OS X Mail: Search within message (including header) I would like to search within an individual email message using OS X Mail version 5.3 or above (Lion, Mountain Lion). I would like this search to include the email header.\nUsing the menu item Edit > Find > Find… or Command-F via the keyboard I am able to search the entire message, exclusive of the header. I would like to search the header, also.\nAn example of how this would be used: An email message is sent to hundreds of recipients which you want to search to find a specific email address.\n\nA: After months of assuming there was no solution to my inquiry, I stumbled on a way to search the entire contents of an individual OS X Mail Message, including headers.\nFirst open the email message you want to search in it's own window. Before initiating your search, select the menu item View > Message > Raw Source or alternately Option-Command-U from the keyboard. This will bring forward a new menu with the entire plain-text content of your message, including extraneous information such as headers.\nIf you search this Raw Source version of your message using Command-F or Edit > Find > Find… from the menu, the search will include everything in the message, including the headers.\n\nNote: Although I'm currently using OS X Mail version 6.5, I verified that this technique also works at least back to version 5.3.\n\n\nA: The search bar in Mountain Lion's mail allows you to do a very minimal amount of searching in the headers (for example, you can search on to:, but not cc: or reply-to:).  As a result, I think that you're firmly in AppleScript territory to accomplish this task.  \nDepending on how specific your goal is, you might find some existing AppleScripts that already meet your needs.  The archives of the AppleScript users mailing list is probably a good starting point, there are plenty of Apple Mail scripts there.\nIf this is really important to you, you might want to consider trying out Outlook:Mac.  It has a significantly better AppleScript dictionary than Mail.app, and you might be able to meet your goal in that application better than in Mail.app.  \n", "Q: Can't install Homebrew on MacBook Pro, password field won't input I need to install Homebrew.

I recently read about a device that reported its \"minimum CPU speed\" (which was 50MHz; max was 1500MHz) and I wondered if my MacBook Air (and other devices like iPhone/iPad) slows down the CPU when not plugged in. \n\nA: Yes. Intel calls it \"SpeedStep.\" Variable CPU clock speeds that adjust to conserve power based on demand. The feature is engaged whilst the device is on battery power. All Apple products support this feature (it's actually supported at the hardware level and the operating system's kernel) but since desktop devices don't have batteries, you'll never experience it on anything that isn't mobile.\nYour MacBook Air supports SpeedStep, as does the iPhone, iPad, and the traditional MacBook Pro.\nMore info on SpeedStep: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpeedStep#Mac\n\nA: I haven't seen any evidence that the MacBook Air scales down its CPU to preserve power under normal circumstances.\nThat said, when your battery runs very, very low, you will probably notice significant slowing. Whenever I play a high-quality game on battery power, the game inevitably slows to a crawl when my battery drops below about 8% capacity. Plugging in will immediately increase performance, so this is clearly the intended behavior.\n\nThe iPhone and iPad (and iPod) on the other hand are portable and not meant to be used when plugged in. They should maintain their CPU cycles when running on battery.\n\n@Siddhartha's statement regarding iOS devices rings true for laptops as well, since they are both designed to be used primarily on battery power.\n", "Q: iPod Model #1238 will not charge I have an iPod Model #A1238 in which the battery is low. I tried to connect the power adapter cable which was provided to try to charge it but no luck. I thought it was the power cable so I bought a new one but tried to charge the iPod with it, still nothing. I then used the new cable and connected it to my daughter's iPod, that one charged just fine. \nHow do you get the port fixed so that it will charge again? \nWhere do you get the parts to fix it since I can't find them on the internet?\nAnd will my music collection of over 9,000 mp3 survive the change out?\n-80GB paper weight.\n\nA: For the second part of the question:\nYou must have a backup of your songs on iTunes..?\nNow, if you replaced the charger and you confirmed that it works, the battery in you iPod might have a problem.\nI would recommend going to a Service Center and getting it checked out.\nBy the way, even if you don't have a backup of songs on your Computer, they can probably extract data from the Drive in your iPod. \n", "Q: Finder not showing toolbar and sidebar sometimes I'm running OS X 10.8.2 with TotalFinder.\nRecently, when launching Finder from dock stacks—for instance, the Downloads folder—by clicking the \"Open in Finder\", the toolbar and sidebar are both hidden (I have them visible by default).\nI can't find an option for that. Is this a bug?\n\nA: You should check, if you have View -> Show Toolbar option enabled. When toolbar is disabled, there's no option to have sidebar and \"Show Sidebar\" option in Finder Menu View -> Show Sidebar is grayed out. \nWorked for me. \n\nA: The key command is Ctrl+⌥ Opt+T.\n\nA: It looks like the answer from @chriliman is out of date.\nAs of MacOS 10.15 (Catalina) the command is now ⌘ Command+⌥ Opt+T.\nDisclaimer: I do have a lot of tweaks installed, so it's possible that I've remapped the original keybinding\n\nA: There used to always be the little curved button in the upper-right that would let you hide/show the side bar.\nLinking the two -- toolbar and side bar is odd -- and stranger yet, only one, the toolbar, can be toggled.  Hence, you can have toolbar and no side bar, but you cannot hide the toolbar and show the side bar.\nThe biggest problem is that the solution is buried and counter-intuitive.  The show sidebar option should always be there -- even if it were to automatically show the toolbar, too!\n\nA: I was able to fix this by restarting Finder (there was an option to do it inside TotalFinder, but now it's appeared after I restarted.). Restarting OS X should fix it tho.\n", "Q: How to change the Admin password from blank on OS X Lion?

Please help me. Thanks!\n\nA: In Terminal.app type passwd, this will prompt you to enter a password for your account.\nAnother way is to Go into Users & Groups in System Prefereneces... and click on change password if possible. Not sure in the case of a blank password if that button will be active or greyed, since I never faced this situation before.\n", "Q: Are there open source software that let OS X see a generic NAS as a Time Machine destination? Is it possible to use \"Time-Machine\" with an external hard-drive through an IP?\nI have an external HD connected to a Raspberry Pi and I have installed SSH. What I am hoping to achieve is this:\nI have a Mac Mini and a Macbook Pro, I want their back-ups to be in-sync but, through the user of an IP that is directed to the raspberry pi that connects the hard-drive.  I know/read that this is possible using Airport extreme but, I do not have that, instead a standard router but I am able to port forward. \nCan anyone recommend any open source solutions rather than needing a Time Capsule or OS X Server running on the NAS?\n\nA: I think what you really want is Netatalk. It is excellent software, and if run with a zfs backend, it is simply perfect as a time machine target.\n", "Q: View original full-resolution image in Aperture 2.0 I want to do the comparison of image quality of 2 lenses, with different settings. For this purpose I need to do the pixel level comparison.\nBut Aperture stores originals of the files internally showing to the user only previews, that are generated according to the Aperture preferences. Currently I have it set to maximum quality and half of original resolution.\nBut I want to compare not previews but originals, to see the difference most precisely, at full resolution. Is there any easy way to look at originals and not previews? Or do I have to change the Aperture preferences to full resolution and then regenerate previews? And if I change preferences, will the previews for my whole library get recreated, or only the ones that I manually force to regenerate previews?\n\nA: I you can just go to the view Menu. And toggle the 'Show Original Image'\n \nThis will stick a label on the image so you know you are seeing an Original rather than a Preview. \n\nThe setting is global by the looks of it. And works in the compare mode.\n", "Q: How secure are password protected PDFs that are created with Preview? I use 1Password1 to store not only my own information, but also my sisters home Wi-Fi information.\nSince she does not have a 1Password licence, I printed out the information for her to store in a safe place. Now, I was just thinking of using the printing dialog (under \"Security Options...\") to create a \"password protected\" PDF.\nBut what does that actually mean and how secure is it? \n\n\n*\n\n*Does this encrypt the whole PDF?\n\n*What encryption is used?\n\n*Is it compatible with Windows and Ubuntu? \n\n\nThere does not2 seem to be a knowledge-base article on support.apple.com. The info dialog in Finder merely says that the PDF is \"Password Encrypted\". \n\n\nA: The last Time I checked a 128 bit RC4 encryption of the whole document was used. Also, compatability should be vested.\nHere's a screenshot of the output of GuaPDF:\n\n\nA: \nBut what does that actually mean and how secure is it?\nDoes this encrypt the whole PDF?\nIs it compatible with Windows and Ubuntu?\n\nPart of the PDF specification describes the encryption of PDF data, and Preview produces a 'to-spec' encrypted PDF.\nEncrypted PDFs made by Preview are valid PDFs that can be opened (when the password is provided) by any PDF app that follows the spec on any platform.\nThe level of encryption depends on the PDF version.\nEarly versions of MacOS saved with PDF v1.4, giving RCA-128bit encryptions. Newer versions save as PDF v1.6, giving AES-128 encryption. You can see the version level of the PDF document in Get Info.\n\nA: Another method, guaranteeing 256-bit AES encryption, is to use Disk Utility to create an encrypted disk image of a folder containing the PDF, or just a text file for that matter. One cannot create a disk image of a file - it must be a folder.\nSteps:\n\n*\n\n*Create a folder, place file(s) to encrypt within\n\n\n*Open Applications/Utilities/Disk Utility.app\n\n\n*Menu item File > New > Disk Image from Folder\n\n\n*Choose folder to encrypt\n\n\n*Click the Image button\n\n\n*Select .dmg save location, read-only and 256-bit AES Encryption:\n\n\n\n*Click the Save button, then enter a password of your choosing or use the 'Password Assistant' which can generate a password for you of several types and lengths. You are also able to store this password in your Keychain.\nNaturally, the encrypted .dmg file can only be opened on a Macintosh.\nThis technique is handy for encrypting anything that can be put in a folder.\n", "Q: iTunes 11 Stuttering During Playback I have a 2011 generation Macbook Pro, upgrade to 16gb RAM and a 128gb SSD drive - running Mountain Lion and iTunes 11. \nDuring playback (approximately 20 times per song) it stutters, stops playing for a few seconds, and then resumes from where it left off. It seems to co-incide with my using the keyboard or performing any file operations - and at the same time the file operations freeze up. The following screenshot was taken about 3 seconds after a skip and doesn't show any signficant CPU activity:\n\nHowever, if I close iTunes, I get no problems with file operations, or any other app on my machine - leading me to believe that iTunes is causing the problem. Has anyone else run into anything similar, or have any advice on stopping iTunes being such a resource hog?\nNote: Other apps (for instance VLC) have no problem with playback under the same conditions. \n\nA: Buried deep in the comments are these answers to solve the riddle of the stuttering iTunes playback on Mountain Lion:\n\nI've just remembered that I have FileVault enabled, and as the crashes / skips happen when the computer is performing file ops, I think turning FV off might help - decryping my hard drive now... – George Pearce Jan 12 at 14:34  \nUpdate: Turning off filevault and decrypting my hard drive appears to have entirely solved the problem. – George Pearce Jan 12 at 19:20\n\n\nA: I have the same issue on Windows since upgrading to version 11. My guess is that the application does not buffer as well as it used to - so a load on the system causes playback stutter.\nA workaround that seems to work is to run iTunes as a high priority process. This can be achieved on Windows 8 via the task manager (\"Details\" tab) or by changing the iTunes shortcut to be:\ncmd.exe /c start \"\"/High \"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\iTunes\\iTunes.exe\"\n\nA: Use an external audio player like Amarra to take control of the buffer and playback and see if this helps. Amarra has settings for how much of a track to buffer before playing\n\nA: You're sure these are not songs that are coming from the cloud?\n\nA: Turn OFF \"Put hard disks to sleep when possible\" in Energy Saver Settings!\n", "Q: how to stop password popups I have a new macbook with osx 10.8.2\nEvery time I want do delete a file, open a downloaded file, and numerous other actions I have to enter my password. Is there a way to turn this off?\n\nA: That sounds odd, have you tried repairing permissions on Disk Utility? I assume you're the only owner of that macbook.\nAnyhow when you try to delete a critical file it will prompt you for your password. \nYou can also enable the root user:\n\nsudo passwd root\n\nIf you log in as root it won't prompt you anymore but this will give access to any application to your system.

Previously, on Windows, an iPhone was recognized as a camera and I could browse the image folder with Explorer without a need to import/download/transfer photo files to the computer.\nIs there a way to do the same on macOS? All approaches I have ever read about are somehow connected to import procedure (iPhoto, Preview, iTunes, etc.) or to hacking the iPhone and installing some apps that will allow to mount the phone as storage drive work.\nWhat is the easiest and most straightforward way to view that files without transferring them to a computer?\n\nA: use ibrowse its free and quite straight forward\nhttp://www.ibrowseapp.com/\nnavigate to the Media\\DCIM\\10*APPLE folders to find the camera roll photos \n\nA: iPhoto will show you a preview of the photos on your phone, and you can view the photos without importing/downloading/transferring/etc.\n\nA: I found a solution here: Basically, with Photostream activated, you can set up a search criteria in Finder to quickly access photos you've take on your iPhone without having to do much work (ie, importing with a separate app, hooking up your device to your computer via usb, etc.)\n\n\nLocate the Photo Stream in the Finder\nSince the user’s Library folder is now hidden by default, I can’t just give you the file path. In the Finder, option-click on the Go menu and hit “Library.” Then navigate to Application Support > iLifeAssetManagement > assets > sub. In the search filed, type “png”; then select “Portable Network Graphics image” from the popup.\nSave the Search\nClick the Save button under the search field. Give the saved search a name like “Screenshots.” Leave “Add to Sidebar” checked.\nThis ought to be the end, but it’s not. For some reason, this particular saved search acts up when accessed from the Finder sidebar (at least on my version of OS X). Sometimes it works, sometimes it returns zero results. The fix for this is to add it to the Dock instead. Hit up the contextual menu and do that.\n\n\nA: The Image Capture app allows you to browse the iPhone's photos, albeit not at full size or resolution, without first downloading the image files to your computer. Image Capture also gives you the tools to download all or selected subranges of the photos on your iPhone, as well as deletion.\n\nA: Open the \"Preview\"-App, select \"File-Import from (your iphone)\" \nand you can manage your photos as you want.\nTo me the most straightforward way.\n\nA: This isn't as direct as just plugging your iPhone into a computer, but it's possible to browse your iPhone photos via dropbox instead.\nJust install Dropbox (via ** www.dropbox.com/) , and use the \"Enable Dropbox Camera Import\" preference setting.\n** Updated : just search for \"dropbox\" on the app store, it's free. **\nNow, every time that your iPhone (or any iDevice setup this way) is connected to the USB charging cable that is connected to your computer, all of your new photos and videos are automatically imported into your Dropbox folder.\nALSO worth noting : Just by using this feature, you can earn more FREE Dropbox space.\n\nA: The only way that I know of to view full-size content on an iPhone…\n\n\n*\n\n*On a device other than said iPhone, and\n\n*Without transferring the content onto said other device\n\n\n…is to use AirPlay. You can use an Apple TV to view your photos on your television, or use a third-party app such as Reflector App (no affiliation) to turn your Mac into an AirPlay receiver.\nWhile I can't test this method myself, it should allow you to wirelessly view (but not edit or transfer) photos on your iPhone using your Mac. I would imagine that you could preview photos with AirPlay while simultaneously using Image Capture to select photos for transferring.\n\nA: All answers here are about viewing previews or recommending legacy solutions.\nI recommend using the shareware application Imazing to view full size photos and HDR+ videos from iPhone without being imported for versions up to iOS 15.5 and above.\n\nA: You can open the Photos app on your Mac, then on the left side bar you'll see your iPhone icon. If you click on it you can see all your pictures, just like when you open it on Windows Explorer!\n", "Q: MBP mid-2012 with SSD, does not hibernate Specs: 15\" MBP mid-2012. Upgraded to Gskill 16GB RAM. Mountain Lion 10.8.2 installed in 128GB Plextor M5 Pro SSD in the optibay.\nProblem: My MBP doesn't hibernate anymore. Whether when battery runs out (0%) or when I manually force it to hibernate.\nI prefer to hibernate instead of \"normal sleep\" because I want all my work preserved but have the MBP to power off immediately to conserve battery. I don't mind having to wait for it to resume and I don't mind about the write cycles. I also need hibernate so I can resume when my battery runs out.\nThings that I have tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Run sudo pmset -a hibernatemode 25 and pmset sleepnow. This will turn off the MBP's display with the sleep indicator turned on for ~15 seconds. After this, the indicator light will then turn off. But, after ~30 seconds the light will turn back on and start blinking/pulsing as if the MBP went to \"normal sleep\" mode. When I hit a key, the login screen will appear immediately without showing the gray screen with the progress bar at the bottom like in a typical resume from hibernation.\n\n*Run sudo pmset -a standbydelay 10 then put MBP to sleep. Mac will sleep (pulsing indicator light) and then after 10 seconds the light will turn off. After ~30 seconds, pulsing light will come back again instead of staying powered off and hibernated.\n\n*Manually force hibernate using apps like \"SmartSleep\", \"DeepSleep\", etc. Still encountered issue.\n\n*No USB device plugged in, turned off bluetooth, turned off \"Wake for network access\", unmounted HDD in main bay. Still encountered issue.\n\n*Deleted /var/vm/sleepimage and let computer generate a new one. Used \"Restore Defaults\" in Energy Saver. Repaired permissions is Disk Utility. Still encountered issue.\n\n*Tried putting /var/vm/sleepimage on the other HDD and tried hibernate and resume. The gray screen with progress bar at the bottom appeared but MBP crashed/turned off and went straight to a normal boot.\n\n*I waited for the battery to drain to 0% and for the MBP to turn off itself. When I connected the adapter and turn the MBP on, it will boot as if it was from a full shutdown. It lost my previous work/machine state.\n\n*I cloned my SSD to the normal HDD installed in the the main bay using Carbon Copy Cloner and booted from it. Then I forced the MBP to hibernate and it successfully hibernated. The gray screen with a progress bar at the bottom appeared and resumed to my previous desktop.\nThat means I know for a fact that when I boot my OS X installation from a normal HDD, hibernate is working. I'm running out of things to try. Final straw might be to transfer the SSD to main bay and put the normal HD in the optibay, or to reinstall Mountain Lion (both options I don't want to do).\nAnyone else also experiencing this and/or knows how to fix this? Or is hibernate really broken for MBP with SSD? Has anyone with MBPs with SSD tried hibernating and resuming successfully? Can someone else please try and confirm if this is isolated? MBAs and rMBPs are not counted because they have different hardware.\nThanks!\n\nA: I've the same problem using late 2008 Macbook Pro running 10.8.3 and have decided to keep the HDD in the shock mounted area due to superior protection.\nI've got a Sandisk SSD installed in the optibay and the original HD in the main bay. Deep sleep worked fine with just the hard disk installed. Now that I've cloned it and boot from the SSD instead, the Macbook refuses to go into deep sleep. Instead it sits there in normal sleep mode with the white light on the front of the machine flashing.\nI tried moving the sleep image to the HD but got the same crash that you experienced. Mind you, the man page for pmset does state that it has to be on the root drive!\nI'm reluctant to swap the disks round because the main bay offers better shock protection for hard disks with the rubber mounts. Looks like I'm stuck with the problem unless Apple fix things.\nAs it stands, you need to choose either sleep compatibility or shock protection when connecting a SSD and HDD to a MacBook Pro.\n\nA: UPDATE\nI decided to reinstall Mountain Lion to see if the problem will occur on a fresh system and it is still there. So I took out my SSD and installed it in the main drive bay and hibernate finally worked! Hopefully the Sudden Motion Sensor for the HDD that I installed in the optibay will still work.\nConclusion, MBP using 10.8.2 will not hibernate if SSD start up disk is installed in the optibay. If someone else can also confirm this it would be great. Thanks.\n\nA: \"Conclusion, MBP using 10.8.2 will not hibernate if SSD start up disk is installed in the optibay. If someone else can also confirm this it would be great. Thanks.\"\nI confirm this! I know many years have gone by, but after a week trying to solve this exact issue, your post was the key! (And the ONLY correct answer I found in the web)\nThe \"symptoms\" were exactly the same you describe, but in my case it was a MacBook Pro mid-2012 with Catalina. I even rolled down to High Sierra, and nothing changed: MacBook just didn't hibernate, did not turn off automatically after autopoweroff minutes in pmset, nor turned off if scheduled. The consequence of this, a very important battery drain overnight (around 5% per hour) that I just wasn't able to solve applying any pmset setting combination / SMC reset / PRAM reset / macOS clean installation / previous macOS versions. I also spent several hours trying to determine if any startup process prevented deep sleep / hibernation... nothing seemed to work, so I almost gave up and attributed this to a hardware malfunction.\nBut... the culprit was a start up SSD disk installed in a case replacing the superdrive, that is to say, installed in the optic bay.\nI simply changed the disks places, with the start up SSD connected to the native disk bay, and the issue was solved!\nThank you SO much!\n", "Q: New email message with a global keyboard shortcut I got, for the first time in my life, a Mac this Christmas and I was wondering if it is possible to create system-wide keyboard shortcut. \nNo matter what app I is using, is there a way to configure a combination of keys so that the new email screen in Mail.app opens? Or, to have the Compose message screen from Gmail?\nI understand that I can use command + N in Mail.app, and C in Gmail web interface, but I would like a global shortcut.\n\nA: I once found a solution for this over at macrumors.com, that works for me. I will quote the important parts (original post from swiftaw):\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a service in Automator\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Automator\n\n*Select Service template\n\n*On the right hand side, use the pull down menus to make it say \"Services receives no input in any application.\n\n*From the left hand panel select Mail, then drag \"New Mail Message\" to the right hand panel. \n\n*Save, give it a name like \"New Mail Message\"\n\n\n*Create a keyboard shortcut\n\n\n*\n\n*Open System Preferences\n\n*Select Keyboard\n\n*Select Keyboard Shortcut\n\n*Select Services\n\n*Find \"New Mail Message\" in the list, add keyboard shortcut (I used Shift+Apple+M) by clicking to the right of the name. \n\n\n*Check that it works. (You can also launch it by clicking on AppName->Services->New Mail Message in the menu bar of any App.\nNote, if Mail isn't running, Mail will launch and then create a New Message.\nBut there is also a built-in solution for composing a new e-mail from anywhere, although it is not a keyboard shortcut: ctrl+click or right click on the Mail.app icon in the doc to get the menu and select Compose New Message. \n \nAlso, there are some individual application shortcuts from within the applications like CMD+i from within Safari.\n\nA: One option is to assign a keyboard shortcut to a script like this:\ntell application \"Mail\"\n    make new outgoing message with properties {visible:true}\n    activate\nend tell\n\nAnother option is to create a service like this with Automator:\n\nYou can give the service a keyboard shortcut from the Keyboard preference pane.\n\nA: Quicksilver with the Mail Plugin can do this. Unfortunately Quicksilver settings seem to have changed significantly from version to version so it can be quite difficult to figure out for the first time. This site is currently up to date with the QS preferences:\nhttp://blog.qsapp.com/post/4866725595/searching-the-web-with-quicksilver\nIt solves a slightly different issue, but provides the info you need to navigate QS's preference panes if you need to.\nThe basic process to send a message is to open Quicksilver (with Cmd-SPC or whatever hotkey you've chosen), press \".\", type your message, tab-tab, then choose your recipient. \nThe link above explains how to set a trigger, so you can open the compose window from a single hotkey.\nA word of warning - my experience with QS is that it is fantastic when you get it working, but it takes a lot of effort to initially get it working.\n", "Q: creating a new user in Mac will it reset everything? I want to reset all my configurations trying to install MySQL & other development stuff through the Terminal on my MacBook and start fresh. Because it was my first time doing this and I think I made lots of wrong stuff. \nSo, do creating a new user will do this or I need to make a new \"fresh\" install for the OS?\n\nA: Creating a new user will trash all the configurations that are stored in the old user's home directory (i.e. /Users/old_username)\nThis does not affect configurations done in the system folders(e.g. /usr/, /etc/, /Libraries\nSo you need to figure out if you configured mysql in your home directory or in the system folders.\nTypically if you had to use your administrator privileges to configure mysql then it's stored in system folders.\n", "Q: iPad maps: hide location circle Is ther a way to hide the blue location circle on the iPad maps?

I'm using a MacBook Pro and I decided to try using my WD Passport external HD wirelessly by connecting it to my Airport Extreme.  I had previously used this external HD for storing things as well as for my Time Machine backups.  I'm showing my ignorance here, but now there is a folder on the external HD called \"MacBook Pro.sparsebundle\" with a little red minus or do not enter symbol on the icon and when I go to run Time Machine it says, \"Oldest backup: none,\" and \"Latest backup: none.\"  But I can plainly see the backup right there on the external HD.  I'm sorry I ever tried this and all I want is to undo whatever I did so I can go back to using Time Machine normally. I just re-formatted this external HD and backed up, and then did a bunch of changes on my MBP.  \nI don't want to start again at zero if there are options for me to continue using the sparsebundle.\n\nA: The sparsebundle is how a backup looks when it's a network backup. This isn't supported by Apple when you connect to an Airport which is why there is a minus symbol.\nYou can connect the drive over USB and start backing up normally but you won't have one place where all the backups exist (and worst case - you'll have two copies of each file - one in the sparse bundle and the other in /Volumes/whatever/Backup.backupdb as a flat directory backup instead of a sparse bundle format).\nIn practice, this isn't really a bad option since you only will lose a file when the drive fills and you could archive the sparse bundle or mount it to see if you can just delete those old backups. If you need to recover files, you can mount the sparse bundle and do the recovery by hand (or hand copy that one snapshot in time into the new format and recover things).\nLastly, you could move that sparsebundle to a supported destination like OS X server, Time Capsule or a NAS drive that works with Time Machine and continue backing up to the sparse image. These all would let you continue backing up, but cost time and/or money. I wouldn't recommend hacking OS X or Airport to make it appear as a Time Capsule, since it doesn't check the sparse bundle which will become corrupt sooner without some process tending it.\n", "Q: Duplicate entries in \"Open With\" menu in Finder even after rebuilding Launch Services In Mac OS X 10.8.2, I have this curious problem. Every time I install a new updated version of one of several applications that I use, my system adds a new duplicate entry in the \"Open With\" contextual menu:\n\nI have tried clearing caches and rebuilding disk permissions and rebooting, but the problem persists. \nI have completely rebuilt the Launch Services database and completely rebuilt Pre-Binding, more than once, by using the standard command line tools and using two different commercial cleaning utilities to do the same thing.\nI have also deleted and rebuilt Spotlight and then rebuilt Launch Services and cleared caches again.\nNothing has any effect.\nIt seems there have been similar questions posted here before, and all of them are incorrectly answered by \"Rebuild the Launch Services database\" but that does not help the problem.\nUpdate 18 January 2013\nAfter filing a bug report with Apple, I have received a notification that this is a known bug that they are already tracking and working on. It is Bug ID# 11582257, for anybody who follows these things.\nUpdate April 2013\nThis bug has not been fixed in Mac OS X 10.8.3.\nUpdate June 2013\nThis bug has still not been fixed in Mac OS X 10.8.4.\n\nA: I have found a Terminal command that works in Mountain Lion. It gives the correct sequence of commands for lsregister to correct this problem:\n/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Support/lsregister -kill -r -domain local -domain system -domain user\nThis was provided by one Dr. Drang on the blog at LeanCrew.com in a post called Getting rid of Open With duplicates. It was posted on February 16, 2013.\nYou can read the blog post at the link above for all the details.\nPresumably, until Apple fixes this known bug, it may be necessary to re-run this command every time a new version of an app gets installed on my system, causing new duplicate items in the Open With menu.\nI must admit that this string was suggested by bmike on January 12, 2013. But for some reason I overlooked it earlier. So thanks, bmike.\n\nA: Do check Wheat's answer where he discovered the circumstances where OS X has a bug and the duplicates are caused by updating an App from the App Store.\nFor others where this isn't caused by a specific bug in Mountain Lion, the rebuilding has ruled out a stale launch services database, you should now rebuild your entire spotlight database. \nThis assumes you don't really have several copies of PDFPenPro - so you might run mdfind app_name before and after rebuilding spotlight since that is the likely cause of duplicate entries. \nThis might also be a good time to be sure your backups are current - random filesystem errors, incompatible utilities, or impending disk failure also could explain the database continuing to get rebuilt with duplicate entries. \n\nA: This has happened to me occasionally, but when it did, it was because there actually were two versions of the app installed.  And so (in this case) the fix is to find and delete one of them.\nHow did I get two copies?  I consider this a bug, but some might disagree.  I have a directory called /Application/Non-Apple where I put any apps that aren't built/maintained by Apple (even though they come from the App Store).  Most apps update to /Applications instead of to the actual location of the app.  Result: the newest version is in /Applications, both versions are in the open with menu, and the Dock still points to the old version.\nIt doesn't have to be this way (and it shouldn't).  I know better behavior is possible because I have two apps that update to the same path as the existing (previous) version.\n", "Q: Why is my iPhone slower with a newer iOS version? The phone has been running perfectly fine with the older iOS version and yet the moment I upgrade I have started looking up applications to free-up memory. Obviously the OS is consuming more memory for internal tasks, but why exactly?\nIs this a strategy from Apple or is there something wrong with the phone itself?\nIf other people are not seeing these results, what should I be looking at?\n\nA: \nObviously the OS is consuming more memory for internal tasks, but why exactly?\n\nNewer versions of software is developed for and tested on newer hardware, which is more capable. So they will not see that issue. My speculation: Apple does not bother to optimize for older devices because their culture is very focused on the future. \n\nIs this a strategy from Apple?\n\nNobody knows unless they work for Apple, in which case they would not tell you.\n\nIf other people are not seeing these results, what should I be looking at?\n\nMy friend has an iPhone 4 and the performance is okay, even though there are some hiccups in animations. If you absolutely cannot stand the bad performance, consider doing a clean install or buying a new iPhone. \n\nP.S.: I have more than 2GB free space \n\nYour bottleneck is probably not having enough RAM, forcing the OS to send memory warnings, purge apps from memory, and reload them from disk.\n\nand I keep the background clear of apps more than a few times per day.\n\nForce quitting your apps actually reduces performance: http://speirs.org/blog/2012/1/2/misconceptions-about-ios-multitasking.html\n\nA: Apple just released information that proves that they are indeed slowing phones down (article 1 and 2) for the purposes of battery life longevity.\nNote: In fairness, the articles state that Apple has started doing this since last year, so an update to the question is pending.\n", "Q: Completely remove a program without uninstall app I removed a program from my MacBook Pro by deleting the app. I also found a few other things in the file system and removed them. Is there a way to ensure no additional information is left on my laptop? Perhaps from command line?\n\nA: There is no guaranteed way or app that will remove all the files used by a program unless the application comes with an uninstall program, even then do you want all documents you created with the program to be removed?\nLeaving aside the documents, you would have to assume that the program was well written and wrote configuration and other files only to the places that Apple suggest. These include ~/Library/Application Support for various files but exactly where in that directory? Some use the application name, others the supplier. ~/Library/Preferences, again what is the file name? Also ~/Library/Caches for caches. Add to these possible use of the /Library versions of the folders.\nOSX does not provide a registry of files used by an app.\nHowever in iOS and now OSX sandboxes all the files will be under one directory and so can be removed - but note this might include any documents you created. Also, note that not all applications are or can be sandboxed.\n\nA: When I want to delete all the preferences without the app (especially when something is acting wonky) I use AppZapper and just uncheck the application. Although as Mark said there is no guarantee you'll be able to delete everything. For example some developers (of unsandboxed apps) create hidden strangely named files in order to counteract piracy. Although this may not affect you it annoys me when I have unnecessary files around after uninstalling applications. This is also why I do clean installs whenever I need to reinstall.\n\nA: The only way to guarantee removal of anything and everything an app could leave behind (especially if you are running using an admin account) is to clone your HD(s), eject the clone before installing and running the app, and then do a complete HD reformat and restore from the clone drive after removing the app.  Make sure the clone is bootable.\n\nA: AppCleaner is a free application which searches for files associated with an App, but I don't know how far it goes in ensuring nothing is left.\n", "Q: Is it possible to have a playback indicator in OSX menubar? On my iPhone, until iOS 6, anytime music is playing a play symbol appears (and disappears when no music is playing). \nHow can I achieve a similar effect in the menu bar of OSX Mountain Lion?\n\nA: Here is sample code for doing this in Cocoa (you can paste it in a new XCode project and build it) : \nAppDelegate.h :\n    NSStatusItem* statusItem;\n\nAppDelegate.m :\n- (void)applicationDidFinishLaunching:(NSNotification *)aNotification\n{\n    [[NSDistributedNotificationCenter defaultCenter] addObserver:self\n                                                        selector:@selector(iTunesNotification:)\n                                                            name:@\"com.apple.iTunes.playerInfo\"\n                                                          object:nil]; //registering for notifications from iTunes\n\n    [NSApp setActivationPolicy:NSApplicationActivationPolicyProhibited]; //No icon in the dock, menubar only\n\n    statusItem = [[NSStatusBar systemStatusBar] statusItemWithLength:NSVariableStatusItemLength]; // For the icon in the status bar\n}\n\n- (void) iTunesNotification:(NSNotification *)note {\n    NSDictionary *information = [note userInfo];\n    NSString* state = [information objectForKey:@\"Player State\"];\n\n    if([state isEqualToString:@\"Paused\"]) {\n        //hiding the indicator\n        [statusItem setTitle:@\"\"];\n    } else if ([state isEqualToString:@\"Playing\"]) {\n        //showing the indicator\n        [statusItem setTitle:@\"▶\"];\n    }\n}\n\nThe only flaw i could see in this sample is i'm using a character for the play icon and not a image. It could be a problem when the encoding messes something up. \n\nA: You could look at some of the menu bar apps that control iTunes for you. Some of those may have a nice interface for that.

While there is a similar question how to make Mac keyboard like Ubuntu, I would like to raise the reverse question: How to make Ubuntu keyboard like Mac? \nI like for instance cmd ⌘ to work as ctrl (i.e. To press cmd ⌘+C for copy in Ubuntu). This makes the life easier when using an Ubuntu virtual machine on Mac, no need anymore to think if you are doing on Mac or virtual Ubuntu.

It's a project I recently created, after a few years of tackling this problem a few different ways and I just now feel like it's solid enough to share.\nThe Kinto installer simply uses python to do the initial install, after that it's just a systemd service, bash, xprop, setxkbmap and xkbcomp.

I have a unibody MacBook, late 2008 I think. The optical drive failed and I wondered about adding a second hard disk. Is this simple to do?\n\nA: I have heard good things about the Optibay kit. It provides a mounting bracket for whatever hard drive or SSD you want to put in there.\nThis video shows how to install it in a Mid-2010 MBP, which is close in design to the Unibody MacBook you have.

So the Wi-Fi may not work afterwards, and you would be on your own since Apple doesn't support modifications. But overall, it isn't so bad. It looks like an easy fix.\n\nA: Yes, I've done it with OWC's Data Doubler and it worked extremely well.

My iOS device is jailbroken, hence OpenSSH is installed.\n\nA: OS X Server integrates nicely for push notifications using APNS, but it's more focused on mail and chat notifications as opposed to sending generic notifications like a turn based game server.\nIt would get your Apple ID approved and be a very nice first step towards getting APNS to be ready to listen to commands from a Mac.\nHere is a nice step by step article on setting up push notifications:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://krypted.com/mac-os-x/enable-push-notifications-in-os-x-mountain-lion-server/\nFrom there, you could use a chat hosted from your Mac as opposed to using iMessage (messages app on iOS to get messages sent with push notifications).\n\nA: If you do not mind a small one-time entry fee ($5) then there are two apps for iOS that provide you with push notifications.\nPush4\nPushover\nBoth provide a simple http API so you can send yourself push notifications from the terminal.

I'm using iTunes 11 under OS X 10.6.8. \n\nA: Nope.\nUnfortunately, iTunes does not save an exact history of when you played certain songs, only the order in which you heard them. \nThere is no way you can know which song you hear, say, 3 hours and 10 minutes ago (totally random figures).\n\nA: To be able to do this you need your listening history, and as the field name \"Last Played\" implies, iTunes only stores the most recent play date & time.\nOne of the many reasons I scrobble all my plays to last.fm from where I then get a lot of stats re top artists & tracks I listen to, etc. Last.fm stats are all based on a detailed history it stores (including date stamp of course) of all the songs you played.\nAlso, if you want to do more with your listening history than the functionality provided by the last.fm web interface, you can always export your data with publicly available Python scripts.\n\nA: Not sure if this is what you want, but you can utilise Smart Playlists for this and the Last Played field. I use it to randomise songs I haven't listen to in a Month etc. and also to get a list of all songs I listened to in the last 30 days.\n\niTunes only remembers the actual Last Played date and not every time you play the file, however for quick searching it is useful.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Select File and New -> Smart Playlist \n\n*Select Last Played and then select Range\n\n\nA: You can export your library as xml file.

How do you force-delete an application that says that its running, but when you try to force quit it, it doesn't show up?\n\nA: Go to Applications > Utilities and open up Activity Monitor. Scroll down until you find your application. Highlight it and click the \"Quit Process\" button in the upper left. Now it is no longer running and can be deleted from your computer.\n\nA: If it's not listed in Activity Monitor, you can probably delete it using Terminal.\nOpen Applications -> Terminal.\nFirst type:\nrm -rf \n\nNote there must be a \"space\" typed after the \"-rf\". But don't panic if you miss it, because rm will just complain about \"illegal option\" and you can try again.\nThen drag the file from the Finder window into Terminal, that will make Terminal insert the full path to that file for you.\nPress Enter and the file should be deleted.\nIf it still refuses to delete (not likely), then try restarting the machine before retrying this.\n\nA: On Microsoft Windows 7 just type %appdata% in the Start Menu and find the program.

I have a MBP 13\" from 2009 (5,5).\nI use it a lot, it's on most of the time (but not all the time).\nAn apple care employee told me he hasn't seen many hard-disk failures, but isn't it the first piece of hardware which is supposed to fail ?\nI did a hard-disk verify, told me I should do a disk repair (red error message), disk repair told me all is fine, and now it doesn't boot, or take ages to do so.\nI have been taking great care of it, all in all my MBP fell once, from a small height. Isn't the hard disk the first thing to suffer from falling ? How resilient a laptop motherboard is against shock versus a hard-disk ?\n\nA: 2009-2010 are prone to hdd cables failing, this can cause the hard-drive to break. I don't understand why the Apple Care guy told you he hasn't seen many (In both of my Computers, I have had Hard-drive failings and cabling failings in the past few months). \nIn the case of my Macbook Pro, my CD drive started going crazy and got very hot, upon inspection (After my hard-drive failed) I inspected it and found the hdd cable to run directly over the CD-drive so this could have caused the lead to break. \nI don't understand your question here, are you saying that your hard-drive has failed? If so, what can/can't you do with the Macbook (i.e. can you see the drive mounted?).\nUPDATE:\n\nnow it doesn't boot, or take ages to do so.\n\nThis sounds to me like the Hard-drive itself has failed, but, it could be the lead. Have you backed-up? This happened to me, in some cases the hard-drive would boot and then would be incredibly slow. There was no flashing folder with the \"?\" I don't know if this is the same with you.\n\nA: If one doesn't have a SSD drive we could assume that the hard drive is most likely the \"weakest\" hardware part. It is mechanical and used all the time. My hard discs break about every three years (this is not a general value, just my experience).\nIt is well-knwon that older hard drives are sensitive to \"disk repairs\" (like you experienced) or defragmentation. The hard drive may already have failures which haven't been recognized by now, because the broken segments were never touched. But if one decides to defrag the HDD, every sector on the drive will be touched, hence also the \"broken\" ones.\nAnother weak part is the fan. It is a mechanical part as well and due to its function it is \"destined to\" gather dust. One should clean it from time to time (I do it every 1-1.5 years) to make sure that the processor will not overheat due to an blocked fan.\n", "Q: I got an image on terminal from the output of homebrew package manager I got a strange image from the output of brew like this . I'm curious about this behaviour. Is this a feature of brew or the image comes from some special character set? If a character in some character set, I think it can be employed to customise the terminal (prompt, etc.). \nThanks and Best Regards!\n\nA: That would be an emoji. You can insert them anywhere by clicking Edit > Special Characters > Emoji. The beer one is under the Objects subcategory.\n", "Q: Prompt When Ejecting Time Machine Drive Whenever I eject the external drive that I use for Time Machine, I get this prompt:\n\nHowever, in actual fact, this particular drive has got only ONE (1) partition, so it's rather annoying that I have to click on Eject All when this should have been a no-frills process. \n\nNote that this does not happen if I simply connect the drive to the USB port and then eject it. It usually happens after a Time Machine backup session has occurred. \nFYI, the backup drive I use is encrypted. Could this be the reason? \nEDIT: In response @matthieu-riegler's question, this is the result I got from diskutil list. As you can see, there's only one entry for the external drive, My Passport.\n\n\nA: Could it be that there is a hidden partition available on that drive?\nDisk Utility can show hidden partitions, but be default it doesn't do this. You can enable this feature by first enabling the program's \"Debug\" menu. Just enter the following command in the Terminal, which will edit the Disk Utility preferences file accordingly:\ndefaults write com.apple.DiskUtility DUDebugMenuEnabled 1\nNow relaunch Disk Utility and you should be able to see the hidden partitions by choosing \"Show Every Partition\" from the now-present \"Debug\" menu. Do keep in mind that editing hidden partitions may not be a good idea in most situations.\n\nA: So, I followed @bart-koopman's advice and enabled Disk Utility's Debug menu. There are definitely more than ONE partition on my external drive. Here's what it looks like: \n\nNotice that only \"My Passport\" is mounted at this point. I was about to give up, when Time Machine did its thing and completed a backup session. This is how it looks like now: \n\nI have no idea when the \"Boot OS X\" partition was created. But I am pretty sure this is the extra hidden partition that caused Finder to complain every time I eject the drive. It gets mounted after a Time Machine backup session and stays mounted the entire time. \nMystery solved?\n", "Q: Macbook Air 2012 memory upgrade I've won a 4gb RAM Macbook Air yesterday. \nI know that the RAM is soldered to the motherboard, so therefore non user upgradeable. \nI was wondering whether my nearest Apple Store could perform an upgrade to 8gb RAM on site? Do they offer that kind of service? \n\nA: Congratulations, that is a nice price! Unfortunately the RAM is soldered to the logic board. So changing simple RAM DIMM's is not possible. The only way to upgrade your RAM is to swap the old logic board with a 8GB memory logic board. In most larger (official) Apple Stores there is the knowhow on how to swap logic boards. But I do not know the costs and I think it is not an economy wise decision.\n\nA: You can't upgrade MacBook Air RAM, because you have to change the entire motherboard, and it isn't cheap.\nI don't think that 4GB RAM are a problem, because if you can saturate 4GB RAM, and it's very hard if you don't do some rendering, system will swap on HD, and your HD is an SSD.\nYou can't appreciate the slow down.\n", "Q: What is writing to Disk causing eventual Beach-ball-of-death What is running my machine down?

The clipboard content can be accessed from the command line and fed to enscript using pbpaste as mentioned in Matteo answer.\n\nA: If you don't want to use the terminal for this task and want a mac 'application' you should look at 'Text Wrangler' by Bare Bones Software.

What happens if I forget to turn off hotspot tethering on my iOS device and connect it via USB to a computer that is already connected to the Internet via Ethernet? Which internet / network gateway gets priority?\nI'm concerned because I may have inadvertently wasted large amounts of my carrier's data usage allotment for the month.  Is there a way to avoid this from happening in case I forget to disable the hotspot again? (this is on a Windows PC)\nEDIT: As a follow up, how can I configure Windows to require manual input from the User before initiating tethering via a USB-connected iOS device?\n\nA: I actually think there's little reason to be concerned, provided in Settings > Network, your Wi-Fi or Ethernet is ahead of iPhone USB in the left-hand list. OS X will go down the list and pick the first network provider that it needs to. So long as your WiFi stays up, you're fine.\nI confirmed this by opening Network Utility and examining the transfer stats. You can see in the attached screenshots that all the action (packets) are happening over WiFi, hardly anything over iPhone USB.\n\n\n\nA: For any Mac users who come to this thread, you can assure that your mac will never utilize the USB tethering option by deleting this interface in the Network control panel\n\nA: The answer as far as iOS is concerned, it will serve tethering until you shut it off. Unless your Windows computer is set up with a manual step, it will see the offer for tethering and connect.\nThis is the same as on a Mac where simply connecting a USB cable to an iOS device with tethering on will initiate the connection. By default, Mac will prefer the tethering, so your concern about data usage is quite valid.\nFeel free to either edit your question or ask a follow on question on how to configure Windows to work best with tethering and have a manual step to prevent the overages that would result if Windows joins the network in the same manner as OS X does.\n", "Q: ECDSA ssh key on 10.8.2 I used ssh-keygen -t ecdsa to generate an ECDSA key, but  I got the error\nunknown key type ecdsa.\nman ssh-keygen says:\n -t type\n         Specifies the type of key to create.

It appears to be available in the OSX OpenSSL installation, though, so you'll just need to compile OpenSSH on your own.\n\nA: The manpage describes the ability to generate ECC keys because the version of OpenSSH 5.9p1 (the version that comes with Mountain Lion) can potentially support ECC. However, the actual build of OpenSSH that came bundled with Mountain Lion appears to lack ECC support1. The manpages are not modified when ECC support is not included in the compiled binaries.\nIf you want or need ECC support, you could use MacPorts (or probably Homebrew) to install a build of OpenSSH that does support ECC. You might run into some incompatibilities though:\n\n\n*\n\n*the bundled ssh-agent (started automatically by launchd) will not be able to handle any ECC keys (you would have to start your own instance of the “custom”-built agent, or type your password each time you use an ECC key with the “custom”-built ssh), and\n\n*the “custom”-built tools will not have Apple’s patched-in Keychain integration.\n\n\n\n1 OpenSSH’s configure script does some checks to make sure that the available OpenSSL library is new enough and includes various bits of ECC functionality; the bundled version of OpenSSL seems to satisfy these requirements. I am not sure why the bundled version of OpenSSH was built without ECC support.\n\nA: Supported from osx 10.10.{0,1} (not sure which one)\n", "Q: Gibberish volume in finder which is inaccessible and un-deletable I'm not sure when it got there, but there is what looks like the icon for a time machine volume in my favorites sidebar for finder, but its name is gibberish : \"_fTz328nSUG4ZgV4k5KaRm.\" If I click on it the name flashes the top of the finder window with the body blank then goes back to whatever the window was displaying before.

This is done in a way that I've seen in many places -- the DMG is attached, then Finder does its job via osascript.  However, the script must refer to the mounted image by its volume name, and AFAICT, these are not unique.  Since the machine that is doing this work is not dedicated for that, I worry that it might already have a mounted image by the same name (likely, since the person who works with this machine is a client of the generated DMGs too).\nIs there some way to refer to a disk uniquely in the osascript if, for example, I know its device or its mount point?  Or maybe there's some other way to resolve this, like attaching an image with a different volname so I can pass some randomly generated name?\n(I'm surprised that I didn't see any mention of this on the web, so maybe I'm missing something more obvious.)\n\nA: After a lot of searching and much cursing, I think that this is really a problem that practically nobody is aware of or concerned about.  Still, I was able to find a solution, it's not great, but it should work.  The idea is to mount the DMG in a known directory with some random name -- this name (the last element in the -mountpoint path) will be the name property of the disk.

Tap to click is disabled within the System Preferences.\nHas anyone encountered this problem before or knows of a solution?\nThank\n\nA: This seems to be an issue with your trackpad not registering everything correctly, or a very slow computer. A way to fix this, but you would have to change the way you bring up the context menu, is to open System Preferences, navigate to Trackpad > Point & Click. Next, you can either disable it by clicking the checkbox next to it, which means you would then have to Control+Click for the context menu.

Which is the most accurate and in-depth log that I can get of what happens on my computer?\n\nA: What you can see in logs are what applications write there. All Apple software writes to the Apple logger database. You can see this and what is written to syslog and files in Console.app. The only easy way to read the database is via Console.app. Note that you might need to start Console.app under an admin user to see all the entries.\nNot all you are asking for like \"applications asked for which resource\" is logged by the application so this information is not normally available.\nWhat can be done to get more information is use some Unix tools like lsof to get a snapshot of what files and sockets are open or Apple development tools like dtrace, googling for examples gave this blog which has scripts to record what files are used by which processes.\n\nA: So you want to peek inside?

From what I have read (https://discussions.apple.com/message/19675983#19675983) this is a partition called \"Boot OS X\" which might have been installed on your time machine disk around the time of upgrading to 10.8.2.  According to the linked article, this partition contains a copy of the Recovery Partition (http://support.apple.com/kb/ht4718) which you can boot from in the event that you cannot boot from your primary hard disk.  This will only give you access to Recovery Mode, not a full OS installation.\nI have observed that this partition is not mounted when you plug in the time machine disk (use the \"mount\" or \"diskutil activity\" commands to see this) but instead appears to be mounted when Time Machine finishes a backup.  I don't know why it does this.\nWhen you \"eject\" the disk from the Finder, you probably need to wait a few seconds before unplugging it.  When the drive icon disappears, this probably means that the main time machine volume has been unmounted, but maybe it is still unmounting the recovery partition.  This is likely the cause of your error message about having unplugged a disk without ejecting it.  If you are paranoid, type \"mount\" to see all the mounted volumes, and verify that the time machine volume is no longer mounted before unplugging the disk.\n\nA: Since the OS starts by assigning disk numbers at /dev/disk0 and working it's way up, it appears that you truncated the output from the diskutil list command. It appears that there are at least three other physical drives connected.\nAre you sure you are unplugging only the disk you ejected and no others? For example, you aren't unplugging a USB hub or keyboard with other drives plugged in.\nMake sure you wait long enough before unplugging the drive from the system. I wait for the drive to disappear from the desktop and then wait another five seconds or so before unplugging the drive.\nDo you have two partitions with the same name? (i.e. \"Time Machine Backups\") This is allowed, but it can get confusing which is which. If so, Try unmounting the drive from the \"Disk Utility\" app, instead of from Finder. Once the disk utility displays the item as grey, then it is OK to unplug.\nGood Luck.\n", "Q: How to remap a few keys for chrome/google docs? I'm using Cmd-Option-1 ..

In Mountain Lion (10.8), when you connect to a wireless network with a default login page - a special window pops up showing that page.  This pop-up is set to always in front, and also doesn't store any passwords / login information (unlike chrome, firefox, etc).  This is really annoying.\nIs there anyway to make this popup window store passwords and login information or just disable that visual step altogether?\n\nA: According to this thread, you just need to rename the following file:\n/System/Library/CoreServices/Captive Network Assistant.app\nto something else and it will not show up anymore.\n", "Q: Will internal HDD spin down when a Mac is booted from another internal SSD? On my MacBook Pro, I am planning on removing the optical drive and adding an SSD to the mix. Since Apple doesn't support this configuration, I don't find any official documentation covering SSD in the optical bay or HDD in the optical bay.\nI presume the energy saver setting would spin down any spindle-based drive when it's idle (like in a Mac Pro), but would like to ask others that may have experience with this configuration in a recent MacBook Pro.\nWhen booted from OS X installed onto an SSD, will the internal HDD be spun down when not in use?\n\nA: I had this setup for a while and yes, the hard drive in the primary disk bay would spin down when booted from the SSD. It was fairly easy to tell, because when accessing the drive there was a noticeable delay when first accessing the drive after leaving it idle for about 10 minutes. This was on an older machine (2009 MacBook Pro 15\", running Mac OS X 10.7).\n", "Q: Can the Growl update message be stopped without removing Growl? I've recently migrated to Mountain Lion. Every now and then I get a Growl notification saying that a new version of Growl is available. The new version is a paid app, which I don't want to buy, but I can't find a way to disable the update message. It's particularly annoying because unlike a normal Growl notification, this one doesn't go away until you explicitly close it.\nIf there isn't a way to disable this intrusive advert I will simply remove Growl from my system - but this would be a shame as the current version is still somewhat useful. (Not every program I use supports the new message centre.) So does anybody know of a way to disable this specific message?\n\nA: From the Growl FAQ page:\n\nHow do I disable the update checker in 1.2.2 and below?\nThe update checker in Growl 1.2.2 and below will run automatically every 24 hours. The update checker in 1.2.2 admittedly is not great, and is one of the reasons that Growl is now in the App Store. \nFor those who wish to continue to run Growl 1.2.2, you can do so but will likely benefit from disabling the update checker. \nTo disable the update checker, follow these steps:\n  - Open System Preferences\n  - Click on Growl\n  - Click on the About tab at the top\n  - Please make sure that you are using 1.2.2. If you are not, please update to 1.2.2 available here\n  - Uncheck \"Check for updates automatically\"\n  - Close System Preferences, you are done\n\nSince the older version is going to become less compatible over time I would honestly suggest just paying the $4 and upgrading to the latest version that integrates all Growl notifications into message centre, even for apps that don't support message centre.\n\nA: I just met this issue too.  I downloaded and built version 2.1.1 using Xcode 4.6.3; this took a while as I needed to download/install a number of applications first (Xcode, command-line tools, Mercurial etc) and follow the build instructions carefully. Being a software developer it wasn't too hard, but it took me much more than $3.99 worth of time to do it.  It was interesting though. If it is compatible with the licence terms, I would consider distributing my build for free: does anyone know if that is legitimate?\n", "Q: Will it Work?..

I've tried to connect using the thunderbolt/ethernet adapter, first into my gigabit switch and then straight into the iMac but it doesn't pick up?!\nCan anyone help with this, so I can use the thunderbolt duo with my iMac until it's time to get a new iMac.\n\nA: Short answer: You can't\nThe 2009 iMac is pre-Thunderbolt, and Thunderbolt is not backwards compatible as far as I am aware. \nFrom what I can see the DUO only has a Thuderbolt port, so you will be out of luck unless you can find a Thunderbolt to USB converter. I am not sure if those exist to be honest.\nThe only option I can suggest is to enable sharing between your iMac and your MacBook Pro and share the DUO of the MacBook Pro instead.\n", "Q: Why does Find My Mac report different locations We had an iPhone and a MacBook Air stolen. I was able to track both units at different times. As I understand it the Find My iPhone service uses GPS and cell tower triangulation to locate iPhones. iPhone location outdoors and/or in areas with good exposure to cell towers is very accurate.\nFor wifi only devices I believe Apple work from a database of wifi points discovered by Apple mobile devices cross referenced to GPS and cell tower triangulation data, derived from those same mobile devices. The location accuracy for this system seems to be significantly poorer. \nWhat I don't understand is why the location for the stolen laptop is reported differently each time it connects to the internet - my laptop location has been given as 6 different addresses all within a few houses of one another. I've noticed the same behaviour for wifi only devices we own that don't leave our house.\n\nA: You are wrongfully assuming that an inaccurate localization always produces the exact same (\"inaccurate\") result. If that were to be the case, the localization would be precise, not an approximation.\nWhile the device and access points may remain stationary, the signal strength and signal noise will vary depending on a lot of external factors from any point in time to another. Because the device uses these parameters to triangulate its position, the results will always vary to some point between measurements.\nTo put it in an analogy, if I have a digital thermometer that cannot show decimals and will round any measurement to a whole number, an actual temperature of 21.5 degrees will sometimes result in 21 degrees being displayed, and sometimes 22. Observing these different results does not mean the temperature actually dropped or increased by one degree.\n\nA: If a person can steal your MacBook, they most probably can and do steal Wi-Fi bandwidth. The thief is stealing bandwidth of his neighbours. This can be proven as all networks are within a few houses of each other.\nAs for Wi-Fi devices at your home, if you live in a particularly crowded area with lots of Wi-Fi networks, your device sees different networks at different points of time as they switch on and off, so it reports slightly different locations.\n", "Q: \"User is unregistered with iMessage\" error message I use an iPod 4th gen and I text my boyfriend on iMessage to his iPhone- either his number or email.

I've also tried iMessaging him on 1 iPad and 2 other iPods, but none of those worked.\nHow can I iMessage him again?\n\nA: Go to the \"No longer have your iPhone?\" section on https://selfsolve.apple.com/deregister-imessage, then turn it on again on you iPhone.\n\nA: Have you tried turning off iMessage on his devices and then re-activating them. I would suggest doing it on his iPhone first and then the other devices.

I've noticed that on some compilations I own, the following can be seen:\n\nAccording to this question the two symbols mean \"Duplicate\" and \"Available for Download\".\nWhy would iTunes do this? It appears it's saying the song is not eligible for iTunes Match, but then is offering me to download it (presumably from iTunes Match).\nVery confusing!\n\nA: It seems you have 2 copies of that song on your local library. One of them was uploaded/matched on iTunes Match and the other wasn't because it is a duplicate. The one with the duplicate icon is the duplicate and the one with the download icon is the one available in iTunes Match.\n\nA: If you have a duplicate (i.e. on a compilation album for example) try changing the song's title. I put the track number in front of the song title (01, 02 etc). Then iTunes sees it as different track and will let you download it. After downloading you simply change the title back.\n", "Q: Applescript Click \"Go\" and \"Open\" - dialog inside application In PCSX, (ps1 emulator), I'm trying to automate the steps to play an ISO.

I have an original Mac Pro with 2 GB of RAM in it. Running Mountain Lion on it is a bit painful - lots of paging. I happen to have 4 GB of PC2-4200 ECC FB-DIMMs kicking about. What I wanted to know is will the Mac run with the slower memory, or will it throw a hissy fit?\nThe Apple tech specs at http://support.apple.com/kb/SP30 say 667 MHz, but nothing about slower.\n\nA: You can't use slower RAM. In fact I've had trouble with some manufacture's RAM even though it met the spec. You need to go to a site that guarantees any new RAM will work in a Macintosh.\nI didn't think that the original Mac Pro could run Mountain Lion. I've got a Mac Pro 2.1, from 2007, that refuses to allow Mountain Lion to be installed. Did you hack this?\n", "Q: What are the sector sizes on Mac OS X? I read on the HFS Plus Wikipedia page that the default sector size on a Mac is 512 b. However, I also read that Macs support 4kb sectors. How can I determine which I have, 512 b or 4 kb sectors? I think 512 is the right answer, but I would like to be sure. \n\nA: The OS X device block size can be determined by executing the following command from a Terminal window prompt:\ndiskutil info / | grep \"Block Size\"\n\nWhich will output the following information:\nDevice Block Size: 512 Bytes\n\nThe file system block size can be determined by using the stat utility:\nstat -f %k .\n\nWhich will show you the Optimal file system I/O operation block size in bytes:\n4096\n\n\nA: With the older HFS file system, Apple's second attempt at a file system for the Macintosh,  there could only be up to 65,535 allocation blocks on a disk. The block size was a function of the disk size in bytes divided by the maximum number of allocation blocks, 65,535. For small disks this was fine, but when disk sizes started to approach 1GB in size the minimum allocation block size was 16 KB (1073741824 / 65535) = 16384.25, but you need to truncate to 16384.\nWhat this means is that a 1 byte file on a 1GB HFS disk required 16,384 bytes to store on the hard drive, so there was too much wasted space. So Apple created the HFS+ wrapper to reduce the wasted space. \nThere may be a way to set the block size higher, but why would you want to?\nHere is a quick bash script that will list all of the diskinfo output for all of your currently connected disks.\n#!/bin/bash\n\nfor disk in /dev/disk*s*\ndo\n    diskutil info $disk\n    echo \"**************************************************************************************\"\n    echo \" \"\ndone\n\n\nA: In terminal, you can use diskutil to get information about the drive, including the device block size:\n$ diskutil info / | grep \"Block Size\"\n  Device Block Size:        512 Bytes\n\n\nA: First, note that Device Block Size is different from the block size in use by the filesystem. The former value as reported by diskutil refers to the raw block size used by the hardware. I haven't found an easy way to check the latter value by the command line, but you can just create a zero-byte file then do Get Info from the Finder. It will say 0 bytes, but 4k used on disk.\nSecond, you can create an HFS+ filesystem with larger than 4k block sizes using the command line program newfs_hfs. The easiest way is to use Disk Utility to partition the drive and create a partition with the default formatting, then use /bin/df to determine the block device (an example only: /dev/disk0s2). Then unmount that partition (using umount /dev/diskXXX or Disk Utility), and to reformat as HFS+ with 64k blocks do:\nnewfs_hfs -v VolumeName -b 65536 /dev/disk0s2\n\nUse the Get Info tip above to verify that a small file now occupies 64k on disk (it may say 65k for powers-of-10 units).\nPerformance is the main reason you might want to do this, if most of the data to be stored are large files (such as MP3s, photo, video, .zip files, etc), and it also helps with keeping disk fragmentation low. Obviously don't bother if you plan on storing mostly small files. \nI have found that on large drives (> 1 TB) formatted as HFS with the default 4k block size, when the drive nears capacity, write performance degrades terribly. I'm guessing that is due to the partition being fragmented and having to hunt and peck for free blocks in order to write out the last 1% of data. I'm hoping that larger block sizes will alleviate this problem somewhat.\n\nA: Looks like the device block size is now 4096 bytes in the 2017 iMacs (iMac18,1), causing problems for people using ntfsprogs.\n", "Q: Recovering access to @me.com account I've just upgraded to Mountain Lion and I've realized that in my Messages app I have 4 accounts:\n\n\n*\n\n*A @mac.com account which I remember creating and using with iChat (I haven't used it for anything else, not even for emails)\n\n*A @gmail.com account, which I use as my main Apple ID\n\n*A Bonjour account\n\n*A @me.account\nMy questions is about point 4: I don't remember creating a @me.com account. In fact, I cannot even recover my password using the security questions or the secondary email address. What other options do I have to recover access to this account?\n\nA: I got a mail from Apple a time ago where they said that I could use x@icloud.com, x@me.com and x@mac.com with no difference. However, I can't find it right now.\nTry send a mail to your @me.com and login to icloud.com with your @mac.com. Did you get the mail? Then, they're all the same account (and have the same passwords)! Else, I hope you did put in an alternative email when setting up your @me.com. Use iforgot and select 'send to alt email'. If you didn't, then you're probably a bit out of luck.\nGood luck!\n", "Q: Some clarifications about Messages.app in Mountain Lion After the update to Mountain Lion I see that I have four accounts in my Messages app (see this question for more information). I am a bit confused about what happened here, namely:\n\n\n*\n\n*The @mac.com account has always been used for iChat, but now in\nthe Messages app it looks like it is used for iMessage\n\n*My Gmail account was used on my iPhone and iPad (I say \"was\" because\nI haven't used iMessage on my mobile devices for a while), but now\nit looks like it is used for GTalk in the Messages app\n\n*I have never used Bonjour for message exchange, why does it appear\nnow in the list of accounts?\n\n\nWhy have there been such changes? If I leave the situation as it is now, does it mean that I cannot receive iMessages on my Gmail account but only on the @mac.com account?\n\nA: There are several things going on here. First, and easiest, Bonjour just appears as an option that you can configure if you have a Bonjour account. No need to worry about that.\nAs for iMessage, you can have more then one email address that other iMessage users can message you at. For example, when I open Messages settings I have a few different accounts in there. Bonjour is disabled, and two Google Talk accounts which I have disabled also. When I click on my \"iMessage\" account, my iPhone number as well as several email accounts which are linked to my Apple ID show in there. So I have my Gmail (which I use for my Apple ID), my @iCloud.com and @me.com email accounts, as well as two others that I have arbitrarily added in so that other users can text those emails as well.\nMessages.app on Mountain Lion can manage multiple types of instant message at one time. For example, I can have a Jabber account, Google Talk account, and my iMessage account all tied into Messages. When someone \"pings\" any of those accounts, Messages \"handles\" that and I can reply.\n", "Q: Deauthorise Apple ID from the Mac App Store I have Xcode installed using an Apple ID that I want it to be detached from. How can I login to the Mac App store using a different Apple ID and then have Xcode reattached to the new account in order to be updated? Not too sure if Mac App store and iTunes are using the same Apple ID.\n\nA: You will need to delete Xcode, sign out of the Mac App Store, sign in with the new ID and \"buy\" Xcode again from the Mac App Store.\n", "Q: Voice Quality on iPhone 5 My setup is iPhone 4 and Bluetooth in my 2012 SUV.\nI have a 80 minute highway commute.  I have real trouble hearing the other party at highway speeds around 65 Mph or higher.\nIf I drop my speed down by 15 Mph, I get much clearer voice quality.  The phone shows me either max bars for connectivity or 4 bars in either case.\nThis leads me to believe that it is not the Bluetooth, or the quality of the phone itself, but the quality/strength of the signal captured.\nThis is the only reason I am considering switching phones. The iPhone 5 for AT&T has the 4G LTE network.\nIs voice quality better because the 4GLTE is a faster network?  Does the quality of voice issue at high speeds go away for the LTE phones?\n\nA: LTE is a data network and voice calls still use 2G/3G. I expect that your problem is related to your call being handed off from one cell tower to another. \nThe iPhone 5 or an LTE phone in general is not going to solve that problem for you.\n", "Q: Index screenshots I want to be able to search through text in my screenshots that I made. Prizmo does the OCR feature pretty well and also has an Automator action provided.

But it keeps attaching its self to the menu bar at the top.\nHow can I deinstall Drive Genius?\n\nA: From the Drive Genius 3 User Guide:\n\nTo completely remove Drive Genius 3 and its utilities from your hard disk, click on Uninstall from the Drive Genius 3 menu. A prompt will appear to confirm you want to uninstall the application and will require administrator authentication to complete the process:\n\n*\n\n*Uninstall: Drive Genius 3 will remove only its support files from the operating system, but will leave the application and registration in its folders for future references.\n\n*Uninstall All: Drive Genius 3 will remove all its files, including the support files, registration files and move the application to the trash can.\n\n\nIn case you've already deleted parts of the installation, you may need to re-download/install the Demo version first (direct download link).\n\nA: In order to properly uninstall the demo of Drive Genius 3, you will need to manually uninstall it.\nTo manually uninstall Drive Genius 3 delete the following files and folders at the end of the paths listed below. Double click on your \"Mac HD\" drive to start the path.  \n/Library/Application Support/DriveGenius (folder)\n/Applications/Drive Genius 3.app (icon)\nIf you are running OS X Lion, Mountain Lion, or Mavericks the last three files/folders are located in the user's Library folder which is hidden by the operating system.

This morning, after I press the power button, it keeps staying at a grey screen with an apple logo and a spinning progress disk, and refused to log in, I've been waiting for a long time. I forced to shut it down and use shift key and press power button again, it did not work, and I shut down again and with option key pressed and I start up again, and it did not work.\nWhat should I do? Thanks\n\nA: The first step is to narrow down which sequence your Mac is failing.\n\n\n*\n\n*Intel-based Mac: Startup sequence and error codes, symbols - HT2674\nSadly, that article links to an old archived version of how to troubleshoot startup issues. You'll want to start on Recovery boot to see if you can fix this hang or need to perhaps reinstall the OS.\n\n\n*\n\n*OS X: About OS X Recovery - HT4718\n\n*http://www.apple.com/osx/recovery/\nIn your case, the Apple logo and spinning gear means that the kernel was found but didn't finish setting up all the system resources. You could re-boot the Mac in verbose mode (hold Command-V at the start chime) to see exactly which part of the kernel /system is not progressing. You also will want to disconnect all peripherals just in case it's an external dependency failing. Usually, this step fails due to a hardware problem or the system needing a clean erase and reinstall (which you can do in recovery using Disk Utility to erase your drive and then re-download Mountain Lion).\n", "Q: What happened to my iChat account? Having recently upgraded my machine to Mountain Lion, I realized that there is no iChat app anymore and that everything ended up into the Messages app. I've been using a @mac.com account specifically to access iChat, so what happens to this account now? Has it become useless?\n\nA: Nothing changes for accessing AIM chat using the new Messages app (that integrates iChat features with iMessage features).\nJust go to Messages -> Preferences -> Accounts to be sure your @mac.com account is entered with a password and enabled for use.\n", "Q: Adding my iPhone number to the list of allowed accounts in Messages.app When I enter my Messages.app settings for my iMessage account, I can see that I can receive iMessages on the two emails that I have entered. Is it possible to add my iPhone number to that list too?\nUntil now I have only found a way to add email accounts.\n\nA: This is one of those things that should happen automatically - but doesn't always. \nFirst step is to make sure your iPhone is on iOS 6. If it isn't, you won't get your phone number to show up (period). \nAfter that, often the best and simplest way to get the phone number to show up is to disable iMessage and then re-enable it. In this case, you would open Settings in Messages.app on your Mountain Lion Mac, Select your iMessage account, and then tap the \"Sign Out\" button.  When you sign back in your iPhone number should appear at the top of the list for \"addresses\" that you can text from. \nThis question/answer may also help in getting all your Messages apps in sync with each other.\n\nA: The only way to link a phone number to an iMessage / iCloud / Apple ID is to sign in to iMessage on an iPhone with service to that number. That iPhone also needs real SMS messages to be sent one time immediately after activation to verify the SMS is delivered to the same phone as the iMessage account.\nFrom then on, that phone is associated with that Apple ID unless you re-link that phone number to a second Apple ID at a later time.\nApple has a nice article on how to manage iOS messages and phone numbers / SMS online:\n\n\n*\n\n*iOS: About Messages - HT3529\n\nA: I fussed around with this for a while too, because my phone number wasn't showing up as an option, only my email. I signed out of Messages on my Macbook Pro and quit the program. Went to Settings → Messages on my iPhone and realized I didn't have iMessages turned on. I turned it on. I also had updated my Apple ID a while ago to my gmail account, but for some reason, Messages on my Macbook Pro had to go back to email@me.com for my phone number to show.\n\nA: lost my aple id passwords several times after downloading iOS8 and then the\nimessaging issues.  Going back to the iPhone to reset the  imessaging worked for me---nothing worked using my iPad2 by itself---I too had lost the phone number from the imessaging send/receive lists. \nALL worked OK after resetting the messaging on my iPhone 5 (which is not using iOS8 but is on iOS7).\n\nA: I found that message on my Macbook wasn't displaying the phone number under Message > Preferences > Account settings but my email addresses were.  To resolve the problem I tried signing out of Messages using my AppleID and then quiting messages then adding my AppleID account back but that didn't resolve the problem.  On my iPhone I had to go to Settings > Messages > Send & Receive where I only found my phone number under \"You can be reached by iMessage at\" I logged out and logged  back in and it added my email addresses and my phone number to the list.  Then I went back into iMessage on my MacBook and all started working.  \n", "Q: Looking for a GTD tool with synchronisation capability There are a lot of Getting Things Done (GTD) tools out there I can use to manage my tasks. Additionally, most of them include synchronisation capabilities I can use to synchronize my iPad, MacBook etc. There is only one problem: they all use the Amazon Cloud/a Cloud located not in Europe... But I'm only allowed to use a Cloud that is located in Europe (data privacy aspects etc... this is a constraint of my employer). Does anybody know a GTD tool that is hosted on an \"European Cloud\" or that can be installed on my private cloud?\n\nA: OmniFocus is able to sync between instances (OS X and iOS)\n\n\n*\n\n*locally via Bonjour\n\n*via a shared directory\n\n*via any WebDAV server\n\n\nA: I use Things by Cultured Code.  It has been fantastic.  It syncs with all my iOS devices.  I believe they are based Germany, so you may be in luck with your cloud requirements.\n\nA: Appigo's ToDo and ToodleDo both have the GTD structure built into the core. the UX for ToDo is much better than ToodleDo. Price is competitive as well. \n\nA: 6wunderkinder's Wunderlist is a great GTD tool with synchronization across all major platforms (web, ios, android, mac, pc). The team itself is based in Berlin, though I'm not sure if that meets your cloud requirement.\n\nA: I would recommend checking out http://www.Gtdagenda.com for an online GTD manager.\nYou can use it to manage your goals, projects and tasks, set next actions and contexts, use checklists, and a calendar.\nSyncs with Evernote, and also comes with mobile-web version, and Android and iPhone apps.\n\nA: If you're using Lion or later, the Reminders app that comes with the OS is pretty good and it auto syncs with your iOS devices.\n", "Q: What is the maximum capacity for a Time Capsule's hard drive? I am thinking of buying a Time Capsule with a small hard drive and upgrading the drive to something larger. There is ample documentation on the web as to how to do it, but I am having a hard time finding any details as to what the upper limits of drive size are. It's especially confusing since there are four generations of Time Capsule, and each one may have a different upper limit. So, what is the upper limit of each? And, if you only know the answer to one specific one, that would be great, too.\n\nA: Nobody seems to know what the official drive size limits are, but I just connected an 18TB hardware RAID to a 1st generation Time Capsule, and it works. To duplicate my setup:\nConfigure a 4-drive hardware RAID using this enclosure:\nhttps://www.newegg.com/sans-digital-tr4utbpn/p/N82E16816111149\n(I used four 6TB drives and set it up as a RAID 5)\nConnect the RAID enclosure to the SATA connector on the Time Capsule's logic board using this cable:\nhttps://www.newegg.com/p/N82E16812119251?Item=N82E16812119251\nThis Time Capsule has pretty much been gutted over the years, so the only thing left is the logic board itself. It's powered by a 2A 5VDC external brick, WiFi and routing are disabled. It's just a hack NAS at this point...but it handles an 18TB drive.\n\nA: I’m running a 4th gen. A1409 Time Capsule, originally equipped with a 2 TB drive.  I replaced that with a 4 TB WD Green (iirc) with no problems so far.\n\nA: Time Capsule 802.11n (1st generation) introduced Jan 2008 is working with 2TB drive. I did not try larger (yet).\n", "Q: Disable Flash in Safari for all but YouTube I dislike Flash intensely (from a security standpoint, plus constantly nagging me to install security updates) and would love to uninstall it in its entirety but unfortunately YouTube requires it. Is there an easy way to disable flash in Safari 6.0.2 for all sites except *.YouTube.com ?\nI'm only concerned about Safari, not so much Firefox and Chrome which I only use on rare occasions.\nRunning Mac OS X 10.8.2\nThanks.\n\nA: You should give \"Click to Flash\" a try. I believe that it does pretty much everything you are asking for.\nThis plugin disables flash in Safari by default, but to load some flash content all you have to do is click on the \"Flash\" button in a video and the video will load and play as usual. You can even whitelist sites in \"Click to Flash\" so you won't have to click on flash videos when browsing YouTube.\nI have not been installing Flash at all on any of my machines. I use Chrome for YouTube, since it has a sandboxed version of Flash.\nEDIT: Almost as soon as I hit Post on my answer I noticed that \"Click to Flash has been superseded by \"Click to Plugin\" which appears to do much more. I haven't tried this, but it looks like the only choice for Safari 5.1 and later.\n\nA: Alternatively, try this Safari Extension called YouTube5. http://www.verticalforest.com/youtube5-extension/\nI've had Flash uninstalled from my Macs ever since I found this extension. If a certain site requires Flash, I'd simply use Chrome. \n", "Q: Set parental controls on an Admin account So this is a strange question, but I'm starting to get really organized and stuff, and I want to make sure my computer shuts off at 10:00 (I'm in high school). The problem is, being the only admin on my computer, I would be able to get around it. Is there any way I can have my parents choose a password to enter, without me knowing it, and make it so I can't bypass it?\n\nA: No - the admin user is the way that the system detects which accounts can modify a parental restriction either once or permanently.\nYou'll need to not use or (have) an admin account or come up with some other social contact like setting up a recurring alarm that you voluntarily obey when the time comes to cease computing.\nScheduling an automatic shut down would also work to give you some notice that it's time to be done and the system would take action unless you over ride the power down.\nJust head to the energy saver preference pane and establish a schedule for the system to shut itself on and off would be my recommendation for a user with admin privileges yet wanting a reminder to keep certain hours.\n", "Q: Script to be activated if web page changes I'm looking for a way to have a script running on my desktop that will check a certain webpage for changes every x seconds, and if a change is made, it gives me an alert. I understand that with high-end websites, some changes will be made almost constantly, but what I'm looking for monitoring now is a bare-bones HTML page that I'm waiting for a link to show up on. Is there a way to do this?\nEdit:\nWould it be a command to download the html and store it, and then a recurring download-and-check command?\n\nA: Save this as ~/bin/example and run chmod +x ~/bin/example.

Any idea that what could be cause this problem? \nI'm using MAC OS X 10.8.2 and late 2009 13 inches macbook pro. \n\nA: My guesses would be either the hard drive or the DVD drive. Your best bet is to have Apple take a look at it. You should make a genius bar appointment at the apple store nearest to you. Unfortunately if they find something wrong your machine is probably out of warranty, but at least you can get it diagnosed for free.\n\nA: I have a similar model and experienced the clicking sound too. Read this: http://6ixpassions.com/post/1095520847/fix-the-ticking-clicking-sound-in-your-macbook-pro\n\nA: I had this same issue after my Macbook Pro fell out of my backpack. My clicking was to the right of the trackpad. Took it to Apple and within a few minutes they diagnosed it as a hard drive error. \nI went and purchased a new hard drive, backed up my data via Time Machine on external hard drive and swapped out the hard drive myself. \nI have minimal tech experience but after watching a you tube video I was able to swap hard drives pretty quick. \n*Make sure you keep the original hard drive. Apple said if I ever have to send my Mac in to get serviced by Apple they will require the original parts to be installed*\nHope that helps!\n", "Q: Automatically hide latex aux files in finder (files with a certain extension) I'm a LaTeX user in OSX. I use TexShop primarily. LaTeX automatically creates lots of helper files with various different extensions (.log, .nav, .aux, .out, etc).\nIt's almost never necessary to view these, so they add a ton of clutter to the finder folders. Does anyone have a good way of automatically hiding these files in the finder? Specifically, I want to hide all of the files with those extensions automatically. They are created every time I compile, so I need a way either for the finder to ignore them (in the way the windows explorer can treat certain extensions as hidden by default) or for the hidden flag to be set automatically upon creation.\nI could actually do this globally if necessary, as my workflow rarely ever gives me cause to invoke or manipulate .log files from the finder. The ideal situation would be to do it only for the folders and sub-folders I use for writing.\n\nA: Hiding all files isn’t implemented on a system level: make a certain file type hidden\nHiding files one by one is trivial:\n chflags hidden /path/to/*\\.aux\n\nI haven't seen a way to implement all the logic required to do what you ask, but I have seen people make up smart folders to show only specific files in a folder that match the good extensions. If your list of places where you want to filter is small, that effort will be less than scripting the hide tool you need. \nHave you ruled out configuring latex to put all auxiliary files in a hidden subdirectory/folder that you name with a dot like .tmp? This is shown here for pdflatex -output-directory=\\.tmp\nAlternatively, you could use a make tool like rubber or latexmk to either run your custom hide script or even discard those files when you compile successfully. You’d only then need to mark in some way what folders get the hidden treatment. \n\nA: I haven't solved this, but to work a report in LaTeX I add \"    \" to the Finder-comment of my main.tex-file, \"   \" to my chapters-folder \"  \" to my images-folder and so on. Then I view my project with folders cascading after sorting by comment. (press command-J to get options to add the comment-collumn to your project window). It's not neat at all, but still.\nI would love a .htaccess-kind of file for Finder that would specify file-endings to hide or show (and, why not, columns or other view options).\n\nA: Not exactly an answer to your question, but I wrote a program that removes all LaTeX auxiliary files from a directory IF they are more recent than the .tex file having the same name.  The programming language is C++.  If you have a C++ compiler I may provide a link to the code (that was an example given in a C/C++ class for students).\n", "Q: How to fix iCloud Outlook calendar pasting? I have a client that has Outlook 2007 on Windows 7. He's unable to right click and paste into the notes section of an appointment (the contextual menu doesn't even appear). I've seen other people having this issue on the Apple support forums and the Microsoft support forums, but no one has posted a resolution. Does anyone know how to fix this?\n\nA: Drag the appointment into the My Calendars folder, then edit it and add notes, etc.  Then drag it back to the icloud folder.  Additions will be there.\n\nA: Apparently Apple made al meetings read-only to prevent iCloud from resending meeting invitations. Doing Control+V should paste, though.\nThere is, too, a Wibbly-Wobbly workaround for meetings:\n\n\n*\n\n*On the meeting, click Forward and Forward (from the displayed menu). Outlook will then tell you that you can't forward the item and will offer to make a copy in your default calendar.\n\n*Choose Yes and A new message with the appointed attached notes.\n\n*Close the forward message without sending.\n\n*Click on the Move to iCloud. Doing this will create a duplicate but editable appointment in the iCloud folder.\n\n*Delete the original appointment.\n\n", "Q: Start up disk full due to backups I am getting the \"disk full\" error message and my computer is running painfully slow. When I run OmniDiskSweeper to find out the culprit it shows that I have over 800GB in \"Backups\" most of them are incremental backups. This is weird because I have Time Machine turned off and use a Mozy for my back ups. Can I simply delete the incremental backups? I tried running the disable script in Terminal but it didn't do anything.\nI have an iMac and run osx, verstion 10.7.5\nAny insight would be greatly appreciates. Thanks!\n\nA: My guess is you had .Mac and ran Apple's .Mac backup tool as described in this article.\n\n\n*\n\n*http://macdevcenter.com/pub/a/mac/2005/09/23/backup3.html?page=1\nIf the files have orange or purple umbrellas as icons, that would be a good clue that they came from that Backup program. Looking at the dates of the files might also help you establish how old they are.\nThese are probably very old and you could delete them or move them to an external drive to free up space on the drive, but it would be prudent to be sure before deleting them.\nTurning off Time Machine would delete any local backup file store, and you can force that by running sudo tmutil disablelocal but those backups get stored on a separate /Volumes/MobileBackups filesystem and are normally very well hidden and don't use any incremental file naming scheme like the older software did.\n\nA: What is the exact path for \"Backups\"? Before you delete the big folder, I'd consider the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*How big is your drive? Since you're getting \"disk full\" errors, you'll need to reformat the drive and restore your data and apps to return the drive to its full performance potential.\n\n*Is 800GB of incremental backup data consistent with your usage on this computer?\n\n*Do you have any other apps that could be backing up this amount of data?\n\n*What is the most recent incremental folder in the \"Backups\" folder? How\n\n*Check again that Time Machine is turned off. Open up the Time Machine systempref. Does it show a \"last backup\" date? \n\n*Do the latest dates on the folder and in the pref panel match?\n\n*I would suggest a fire drill on your Mozy backups to make sure it's working like you intend. Select an older folder with a number of files and copy it to another drive (USB drive, hard drive, cloud storage, all will work for the test). Delete the file and wait through a backup period. Restore the file. \n\n\nIf you're sure your backups are living happily on your Mozy, and no other approved app is using this backup, feel free to delete the Backups folder. You may need to authenticate the delete as an administrator. Do this in Terminal with the sudo command.\n", "Q: Wireless keyboard pressing the command key by itself Recently, my Apple wireless keyboard has been pressing the command key by itself repeatedly. It's stuck like that until I turn off then on the keyboard.\nAnyone know why this is happening and how I can fix it?\n\nA: Sounds like a hardware problem - you could try disassembling it and cleaning the contact layer.\n", "Q: How can I browse my pdfs? I have a great many directories where I've latex'd my notes on various topics, so many that I'm beginning to have trouble finding things.  Is there a way to display thumbnails of all the pdfs (under a given parent directory) in a single window so that I can browse my notes?\nAlso, I've noticed that Mountain Lion is not generating thumbnail icons from my latex pdfs.  Not sure why.\n\nA: Finder's \"All my files\" section has pdf-documents category.\n\n\nA: Press ⌘F, set the search scope to the current folder, and set kind to PDF. You can then save the search and open it from the sidebar or Spotlight.\nThe view options are saved in the .savedSearch file, so you can set it to open in icon view and have large icons and low grid spacing.\n", "Q: Permanently show hidden directories I am trying to repair a friend's USB drive that got a virus. All directories became .lnk and the original ones were hidden. I don't know how to permanently show the folders.\nI've used sudo chflags nohidden /path but it doesn't work permanently.\n\nA: Files & folders that start with a period will always be hidden in the Finder, and in Terminal listings (ls command, unless you use the -a flag i.e. \"ls -a\"), If renaming the folders is acceptable, then just remove the period from the folders you want to show.\n\nA: There are a couple of ways to do this:\nIn Terminal\nTo show all hidden files:\ndefaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles YES; killall Finder\n\nTo hide hidden files: \ndefaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles NO; killall Finder\n\nWith an application\nYou can download one of many applications that do this on mouse click. There are many, but the first one that comes up in a google search is Show Hide Invisible Files.\n\nA: chflags nohidden should be permanent, but it doesn't affect files that start with a period.\nThis makes Finder show all hidden files:\ndefaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles -bool true; killall Finder\n\n", "Q: Retina Macbook Pro BootCamp vs Parallells Performance I'm thinking of getting rid of my old gaming PC and just bootcamping / virtualizing on my Retina Macbook Pro.\nI've tried using a VM (VMWare Fusion) and the performance there was pretty awful, has anyone tried both Virtualization (either VMWare or Parallels) and BootCamp? \nHow much better is BootCamp performance on the Retina Macbook Pro compared to VMWare or Parallels? Will it be able to handle most PC games?\nThanks.\n\nA: BootCamp is usually between 3 and 4 times faster than either VMWare or Parallels. Bootcamp is the actual OS running on real hardware, where the other choices are running  inside the constraints of the host OS and must share resources (memory, cpu, etc...) with the host OS. BootCamp has full control of all of the system's resources.\nIt should be able to handle PC Games, although I'm not sure what screen resolution will be reported or what graphics card will be used. If the screen resolution is reported as the actual number of screen pixels, some of the in game text may be difficult to read.\n", "Q: iCal and Google Calendar Syncing Is there a way to sync my iCalendar to my Google Calendar? I use the iCal application as my primary calendar resource, and I need to share that data via GoogleCalendar with my colleagues and I cannot figure out how to do this. I am able to get the data from my GoogleCalendar to show up on my iCal, but I cannot do the reverse (I want data created on the iCal to upload/sync directly to the GoogleCalendar).. I have OSX Lion and iCal 6.0\n\nA: To do so just:\n\n\n*\n\n*On iCal go to Preferences / Accounts.\n\n*In the panel on the left, click the + button to add an account.\n\n*Fill in the information, being:\n\n\nAccount Type: Google. Although you can either use Automatic or CalDAV, and the System will detect the proper account type.\nEmail Address: The email which you are using to log into the Calendar. The @domain.com part should be written too.\nPassword: Well, the password for that account. If you are using 2-Step verification you must use an application-specific password.\nDoing this, by default, will sync any calendars that appear in My Calendars on the web, as well as the Contact's birthdays and events.\nAdding additional calendars, or removing any of them from syncing, you must go to the Account Sync Configuration Page, and select the calendars you'd like to be displayed.

There is no lack of to-do apps designed at least somewhat around Getting Things Done - just see the answers to this question, for example. I'm a user of Things on iOS and have heard a lot about OmniFocus, but I've never gotten a good recommendation for an app that can manage to-dos for more than one person. \nMy wife and I are looking to adopt a GTD-inspired workflow for a variety of personal projects, some shared, some individual, and it would be ideal to manage these projects side-by-side.\nShort of us each running our own instance of a given app on our separate devices, and including iOS / OS X synching among my requirements, do any of the flagship GTD to-do apps offer the concept of projects and to-dos that belong to a specific person of several?\n\nA: There are several, even though some of them may not be as native to OS X and iOS as Things or Omnifocus.\nAsana, Trello and Flow are good examples. They offer nice web apps to be used through a web browser, and native iOS apps. Both offer the GTDesque approach, and allow assigning tasks to individuals.\nAnother alternative, which does offer an OS X app, is Producteev.\n\nA: I use BusyCal for this purpose.  BusyCal manages both calendars and tasks.  My husband and I have a total of three definite calendars between us: our individual calendars, and a household calendar.  We also set up specific calendars to manage projects.  For example, we've got a calendar for the household renovations that we're in the midst of, and we use that to track milestones and tasks and so on.\nWe share these calendars via CalDAV because we run a server at home, but you can use a shared iCloud or Google Calendar account as well, and that works well.  There's also an iOS application.\n\nA: I use the built-in reminder app of iOS and Mountain Lion.\nI create my different TO-DO lists, and when I want to share one with my wife (Shopping List), I click the sharing button. Updates are then synced automatically. Works like a charm.\nMay not be as fancy as those 3rd party apps, but it's free and built-in.\n\nA: The reminders app that is part of Mountain Lion allows multiple task lists so you could use one for each person.  The wrinkle would be that assigning things to a date can't be filtered so you'd see your composite task lists when viewing the day.\n\nA: Wunderlist.\nWunderlist is free and has both an iOS and OS X app. As well as Android and Windows.\nYou can create individual and shared to do lists and track progress. Put in notes etc.\nYou do have to create an account, but then all your todo's are synced over different devices.\n", "Q: Is there any way to disable Mac OS X global search string propagation? Mac OS X has a feature where if you use any search box in any app, it automatically overwrites every other search box with the text you searched.\nI find this rarely useful and it often interferes with any workflow where I expect an individual app to stay pre-filled with what I last searched in that app. Is there any way to disable it?\n(I've also never seen anyone discuss this feature anywhere.

How do I lock iPhone 5 in landscape mode? I see how to lock it in portrait mode, and I've tried locking it in landscape mode using the assistive touch feature, but that isn't working for me.\n\nA: Apparently you can!\nIf you want to try this out for yourself, here is the navigation to get to the setting:\n\n\n*\n\n*Enabling AssistiveTouch: \n\n*Settings App>General>Scroll Down to Accessibility>Scroll Down to AssistiveTouch '\n\n*Toggle on AssistiveTouch.\n\n\nSwitching to Landscape:\n\n\n*\n\n*Lock the device in portrait mode\n\n*Press Floating Square>Device>Rotate Screen>Left/Right\n\n\nhttp://www.todaysiphone.com/2011/10/tips-tricks-lock-iphone-orientation-in-landscape/ ......................\n\nA: You cannot. The iPhone is not like the iPad, which truly and fully supports the two modes (even SpringBoard rotates). The iPhone doesn't technically have a true landscape mode. At best, most apps support the orientation but that's as far as it goes. Rotation Lock on the iPhone locks the device in portrait mode. You can test this yourself by going into Mail, turning the device sideways (landscape) and then engaging the orientation lock. You'll see that Mail will orient to portrait. \n\nA: As the other people have said, it is impossible to truly lock your phone in landscape mode. I do not know exactly why you want to do that, but I'm going to guess it is so that the screen does not flip back to the standard orientation when you are trying to read or watch something while lying down your side.\nIf that is the case, there is another solution: Orient the phone so that it is perpendicular to the ground until it jumps into landscape mode, then simply turn the phone so that the home button is at the top and the camera is on the bottom. The screen should remain in landscape mode and you may browse in comfort. \nIf my guess was off, perhaps you could further explain why you'd like to lock the phone in a landscape position and perhaps there is an alternative means to your intended result.\n", "Q: Unable to ping any website through terminal and network utility I have internet connection and I can access every website.

Is there a way to prevent it?\n\nA: Actually my problem was that Blackboard on OSx uses Chalkboard while on iOS use Chalkboard SE.\nSo I had to change all the fonts form Chalkboard to Chalkboard SE.\n", "Q: How can I prevent Messages from opening up a new chat window? When I am working on something else on my iMac, I tend to get a lot of messages via the Messages app.  For some reason, when I click once on the messages app window, it does not get focus right away: Therefore, I usually double-click (Perhaps its a habit from MS Windows).  When you double click inside a chat area, it opens up that specific chat conversation into a new chat window - which is extremely annoying (IMHO).\nIs it possible to turn off the feature of opening that chat conversation in a new window?\nI am running 10.8.2 and Messages version 7.0.1 (3314).  \nEDIT: So some further testing - This happens when:\n\n\n*\n\n*A different chat session is selected\n\n*Messages does NOT have focus\n\n*I click into a different chat session inside of my Messages window\n\n*\n\n*this requires two clicks, 1 click to gain focus, 1 click to change chat windows.\n\n\n\nAll I am looking to do is disable the chat session from opening up in a new, independent window. \n\nA: Unfortunately this is something that isn't possible. As you are aware, the only control we have over any double-clicking in the \"Double-Click Speed\" in Mouse preferences. Any changes here would be undesirable as it would affect the entire system and your goal is just the Messages app. \nThere is a convenient keyboard shortcut, Command + W, to close the new window that comes up, so at least you don't have to go over and manually close the window.\nI suppose this is a feature request that doesn't come up very often but you could at least do what you can and fill out a feature request.\n\nA: Try single clicking instead of double clicking. You could also try clicking somewhere else in the window, for example the Title Bar, or the message composition area. Double clicks in these areas should have the same effect as single clicking.\n\nA: When you get a new message, while in another app, instead of immediately clicking on Messages, instead hit Command-Tab and click on the Messages icon. That will bring the Messages app to the foreground without actually having clicked directly on Messages! Then you can click on that new message, and it will behave itself, staying contained where it should instead of popping out a new window!\nSource: https://www.theinternetpatrol.com/how-to-stop-mac-messages-from-popping-out-and-opening-a-new-window-when-you-click-on-a-message/\n", "Q: Mimic Xcode's camelCase selection keyboard shortcuts in OS X I spend a very large amount of time editing text in Xcode, and I would like maneuvering around text within the rest of the Cocoa Text System to offer an identical experience. There are 3 versions of cursor keyboard shortcuts that I use regularly in Xcode (only showing forward, non-selection-altering versions for brevity):\n\n\n*\n\n*⌃+→Move cursor 1 subword forward (^camelCase -> camel^Case -> camelCase^)\n\n*⌥ Option+→ Move cursor 1 word forward\n\n*⌘ Command+→ Move cursor to the end of the line\n\n\nThe OS X default keybindings respect 2 and 3, but there is a disparity with 1. Outside of Xcode, ⌃+→ behaves like ⌘ Command+→. It's not applicable terribly often, but every time ⌃+→ takes me to the end of a line in Mail or something, it's like a little firecracker goes off in my brain. It's just annoying enought that I'm willing to invest in any hackery to \"fix\" the behavior once and for all.\nTo avoid covering old ground, I'm already aware of this little tidbit, and this list of selectors, but I'm not aware of any API in the Cocoa Text System for subword selection. Maybe there's undocumented API in there somewhere? \n\nI don't always attempt to make camelCase selections outside of Xcode with keyboard shortcuts, but when I do I want OS X to obey.\n\nA: Sorry but what you want is not possible.\nYou could try adding the XCode keybindings that do this\n\"^\\UF702\" = \"moveSubWordBackward:\";                     /* Ctl-Left Arrow */\n\"^$\\UF702\" = \"moveSubWordBackwardAndModifySelection:\";  /* Ctl-Shift-Left Arrow */\n\"^\\UF703\" = \"moveSubWordForward:\";                      /* Ctl-Right Arrow */\n\"^$\\UF703\" = \"moveSubWordForwardAndModifySelection:\";   /* Ctl-Shift-Right Arrow */\n\"^\\177\" = \"deleteSubWordBackward:\";                     /* ctl-delete */\n\"^\\UF728\" = \"deleteSubWordForward:\";                    /* ctl-forwardDelete */\n\ninto your ~/Library/KeyBindings/DefaultKeyBindings.dict file but unless the application is written to respond to these methods, it won't work.  As you've said, these methods are not part of the standard Text System so these calls in an app will just go unanswered or you will get a system beep.\n\nA: To navigate camel case (aka sub-words) to the right use \n^ + [ to move a sub-word to the left \n^ + ] to move a sub-word to the right\nI confirmed this in OSX 10.10.1 running Xcode 6.1.1.\n", "Q: Rebuilding iPhoto library causes issues with iTunes photo sync I recently had a nasty problem with my iPhoto library that I corrected by rebuilding it. This restored missing/corrupted photos and fixed several other inconsistencies, so iPhoto is working properly again.\nBut now, iTunes is the one that's having problems. Whenever I connect my iPhone and visit the Photos pane, it tells me that my iPhoto library contains 0 photos (and, since I sync selectively, it says the same next to every item I've checked). It reported all the right counts before I rebuilt my iPhoto library.\nNot only that, but whenever I sync for the first time after connecting, the photos will mysteriously disappear from my iPhone and I'm forced to resync them, even when I don't make any changes (not even outside the Photos pane). The photos then stay on my phone as usual, but once I connect and sync again, the same thing happens. I don't have a large photo library so it's only an extra couple of minutes of waiting, but it's still something I shouldn't have to put up with every single time I connect and sync my device.\nI'm using iTunes 11.0.1 and iPhoto 9.4.2. My computer runs OS X 10.8.2, and my iPhone runs iOS 6.0.1. All are at their latest versions as of this writing.\nWhat can I do to make iTunes read and sync my iPhoto library properly again?\n\nA: Hopefully you have the run of the mill, the iPod Photo Cache is now stale issue which is easily remedied.\n\n\n*\n\n*iTunes: Understanding the iPod Photo Cache folder - TS1314\nSince you are on Mountain Lion, this is just a folder in the \"iPhoto Library\" and you can right click on it, and show package contents. Just drag that folder to trash and then quit both iPhoto (and Aperture if you have it) as well as iTunes.\nA re-launch of iTunes should see that the folder is missing and clear any sync tokens, and proceed to rebuild a list of pictures, albums and events. Usually, there isn't a second step needed as this folder is designed to be safe to delete at any time to save space on a drive and exists to speed up syncing.\nAs always, kicking off a backup when looking into deleting things is never a bad idea in case the corruption is deeper than expected or just a sign of a failing storage device.\n\nA: Ah, geez. Trust me to forget all about my own question until a year later (and then some).\nI never found a way to fix my existing library, so I had planned to start from scratch by exporting all photos from my existing library, creating a new library, and importing and rebuilding everything by hand. Unfortunately, I never had a chance to do that either (yes, not in a whole year; don't ask).\nToday, while preparing for an upgrade to my Mac, I decided to take a look at the problematic library again. Since a new version of iPhoto has been released coinciding with the release of OS X 10.9 Mavericks, I let it upgrade my library. So far, so good — the library opens and I can still see all my photos and metadata.\nSo I opened iTunes, connected my iPhone, and tried syncing the iPhoto library to it. After a few experiments... it looks like the syncing problem I described has vanished completely. Everything syncs properly now. iTunes reports all the correct numbers. And my iPhone doesn't get wiped on every subsequent connect-and-sync either.\nI wish I could find out what exactly the upgrade process did to fix things so I could at least understand what the problem was and provide a much more useful answer. For now, I suppose all I can say is to wait and see if a library upgrade with an updated version of iPhoto works.\nOne thing's for sure, though: I'm not rebuilding my photo library from scratch anymore.\n", "Q: Display appears different on two accounts using same color profile I have 2 accounts on my Mac Pro both are using the same color display profile however on my account it is clearly a lot brighter.

I have to move the curser away, wait a couple seconds for the scroll bars to hide, then click the item.\n\n\nA: In \"System Preferences > General\" There are three options for \"Showing scroll bars\". From your description, it sounds like you have the default settings of \"Automatically based on mouse or trackpad\"\n\nYou may find \"When Scrolling\" or \"Always\" more to your liking.

I'm hoping to avoid having to purchase a full 500GB external HD.\n\nA: Snow Leopard requires about 5 GB of space to install itself and will run with not much more space than that total in most cases.\nInstalling on a low capacity flash drive (USB storage) is possible, but very slow since the chips there are optimized for low power and react far, far slower than even a basic, bargain basement spindle hard drive.\n", "Q: How to disable command-Q for Quit? Is there any way to disable command+Q for quitting apps?\nI tried adding this menuitem to the \"Keyboard Shortcuts\" preference pane (as suggested here), and remapping it to command+option+Q (slightly harder to hit), and the menu item changed to show this, but command+Q still causes the app to quit.\nI'm using OS X 10.7, but I'd happily upgrade to 10.8 if it fixed this.\nThe app I really want this for is Firefox, but if there was a solution that disabled command+Q for every app, that would be fine, too.\n\nA: Using KeyRemap4MacBook, you could add this to private.xml:\n<item>\n  <name>disable_command_q</name>\n  <identifier>disable_command_q</identifier>\n  <autogen>__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::Q, VK_COMMAND | ModifierFlag::NONE, KeyCode::VK_NONE</autogen>\n  <autogen>__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::Q, VK_COMMAND | VK_SHIFT | ModifierFlag::NONE, KeyCode::Q, ModifierFlag::COMMAND_L</autogen>\n</item>\n\nWithout | ModifierFlag::NONE the first autogen element would also disable for example ⌥⌘Q.

Select Shortcuts. On the left pane, find Accessibility. Now on the right pane enable Invert colors and then click on the shortcut box to reassign the shortcut to Cmd+Q.\nThat's it. Now when you press Cmd+Q the colors of the screen will be inverted. Press it again to go back to normal colors. No more accidentally quitting applications (like closing over two hundred tabs on Firefox when trying to use Cmd+a or three dozen pdfs on Preview when trying to use Cmd+tab; last two things I did, never again.)\nP.S. Whoever thought it was a good idea to use Cmd+Q to quit applications should go back to usability school.\n\nThere's also a nice plugin that you can use called Always Ask, which forces a prompt dialog before leaving Firefox.\n\nA: Go to System Preferences>Keyboard>Shortcuts then the application button on the left bar. Press the + button then Choose your application. Write \"Quit (Application Name)\" in the Menu Title Slot. Add your command to replace cmd-q and that's it.\n\nA: I have found a way to do this without having to change your volume or stuff like that when you press command+Q.\ngo to system preferences -> keyboard -> mission control -> \"do not disturb\". \nThen just click the box and change it to: command+Q.\n\nA: Sorry for digging up such old post but this idea may be useful.\nIn System Preferences - Keyboard create a new shortcut for the application you want to prevent quit. Search for the title of the quit command in the application's menu and enter the same exact as a Menu Title for the shortcut, then give a different shortcut.\nIndeed, you don't have this issue with all applications but only browser and maybe one or two other apps.\n\nA: As you have seen, just setting a new keyboard shortcut in the System Prefs doesn't always work.  It will change the shortcut shown in the menu but the application could still be listening for the Commmand+Q keypress.  I've seen a few apps that do this.  Even some will listen to keypresses that are not listed as shortcuts in the menu (Photoshop for example).\nA 3rd party option is to use something like ControllerMate.  It has the ability to remap any controller input (keyboard, mouse, trackpad, joystick, etc) and change what it does.  I use it to do many remaps and run macro scripts.  They can be set on a per-application basis or a global system-wide state.\nUsing ControllerMate, you could map Command+Q to do nothing then have Command+Option+Q call the Quit menu entry.  Or you could get fancy and have Command+Q do nothing except if you press Command+Q again within 1/2 of a second then it would call the Quit menu.\nControllerMate is an amazing app.  I've done many customizations like a \"Boss/Spouse Mode\" which is a single keypress that does the following\n\n\n*\n\n*mutes the computer audio\n\n*pauses iTunes if it is playing\n\n*quits QuickTime and/or VLC if it is running\n\n*minimizes current Firefox windows and opens a new window to Google.com\n\n\nAnother suggestion (along with Henry's suggestion) is to use a session manager so if Firefox is quit by accident, you can restore easily.  The built-in session manager is OK but you should also look at Tab Mix Plus.  Not only does it give you amazing options for managing your tabs but its session manager is also great.  I have many sessions saved and can pull them up quickly anytime in new windows.\n\nA: Simply I have replaced the existing command with new one,\nEx. I replaced Quit command for Sublime Text for MAC,\nI used to Add new shortcut and added new command alt+command+c\n\nA: There is on solution not posted here that I thought should merit consideration.\nIf you don't mind removing the command+q entirely from your computer you can effectively remap in Ukulele so that Command+Q execute another keyboard shortcut.\nYou could make it execute command+space or command+1 just assign it to something else.\nThere are positives and negatives to this approach but it should work.\n\nA: Go to settings → Keyboard → shortcuts → App-keyboardshortcuts(on my mac: 'App-Tastenkurzbefehle')\nPress '+' Then add shortcut for the programm you wish to deactivate Command+Q.\nAfterwards type exectly the name of the menu point! Because my mac is geraman there is written 'Safari beenden'.\nI prefer this solution because I still can close safari with a short cut but I am not doing it by accident.\n\n\nA: use Switcher can prevent you to press cmd + q by mistake\n", "Q: Share internet between iPad and PC I've been searching for this for a while without satisfactory results.\nOne way to share internet from the PC to the iPad is by doing an ad-hoc network, if the PC allow us to do so.

I recently migrated from 10.6 to 10.8. I use Terminal to connect to various linux boxes where the TERM variable is observed to be xterm-color.  This seems to be consistent with the 10.6 setting of TERM.\nHowever, since upgrading I've been having issues with my Terminal sessions if/when I resize them to something wider than 80x24.  What would normally be very long lines of text seem to wrap at 80 columns until I resize again, at which point it displays properly.  That is, it's like the width is stuck at the last size (wrapping everything at the previous width) until a resize is done after displaying something expecting a greater width.\nThis sort of feels like either the [n]curses entry for xterm-color got changed (it didn't) or that terminal is not really emulating an xterm-color device.  The behavior is different (maybe better--I'm still evaluating) if specify a plain xterm.\nIs there a better setting for TERM when using Mountain Lion's Terminal?\n\nA: As with many terminal emulators, Terminal emulates most of a VT100 plus some features from newer terminals, and some common extensions from xterm and other emulators.\nThere is no terminfo file that exactly corresponds to Terminal, but the closest match used to be xterm-color, which represents an older offshoot of xterm. However, in recent versions Terminal is more fully compatible with xterm and xterm-256color is the new default value for the TERM environment variable.\nIn Preferences > Settings > [profile] > Advanced > Emulation there is a popup menu Declare terminal as: that sets the value of TERM (and that's all it does—it does not alter which features Terminal supports). If you're using a Mac that you've upgraded from an older OS version, you may want/need to update the setting to match the new recommended default if it is still set to xterm-color. Using xterm-color is not recommended and it is possible for it to cause problems because it isn't as close a match to Terminal's current feature set.\nDespite the fact that installations of ncurses should include all terminfo files, some Linux distros do not, and in particular some of them omit xterm-256color. If this is the case you'll see programs complain in various ways about not being able to find it, and the solution is to install the entire set of terminfo files, or at least all the xterm ones.\nIf xterm-256color isn't available, the next best thing is xterm-16color, followed by xterm. These three are compatible and represent the current xterm version with decreasing numbers of supported colors (xterm only declares the eight basic ANSI colors, though a lot of programs simply ignore that and assume that sixteen are supported, but xterm-16color is the one to choose if you want to explicitly declare support for sixteen colors).\nIt's difficult to say exactly what could be causing the problem you're seeing, but the first thing to try is to run the infocmp command on the remote host to see what it says. That will tell you which terminfo it is expecting and whether it was found.\nIf it's a generic ncurses or terminfo issue, it's likely to occur with other programs, like vim. You might try running vim or less, for example, to compare behaviors. If you're feeling motivated, you could run vttest http://invisible-island.net/vttest/ on the remote host and check that Terminal responds appropriately to the tests for drawing text attributes, resizing the display, and switching to/from the alternate screen.\nWhen you resize a terminal window, the terminal program notifies the tty device, which sends a SIGWINCH signal to processes connected to it. Programs are responsible for responding to the signal appropriately. One thing to test is whether the LINES and COLUMNS variables get updated in bash when you resize the terminal window. If that's working, then the signal mechanism is behaving correctly.\nAnother possibility is that the program isn't switching to/from the alternate screen correctly (which could be caused by having an incompatible terminfo selected). You can check the View > Hide/Show Alternate Screen menu item to see which screen is currently active. If it's showing the wrong screen, you might try manually switching it with the menu item and see if that clears up the problem.\n", "Q: How to download contacts from iPhone to Mac? I was able to do a backup of the phone using iTunes, but how do I see and access the contacts?\nDo I need to import them into Address Book?\nIs there a better way to download contacts from iPhone to Mac?\n\nA: The best solution *IS* iCloud sync. \nSimple and without any fuss \nBut a simple syncing over USB or Wifi to iTunes should ask you if you want to merge your contacts when contacts syncing is enabled (iTunes>iPhone>Info>Sync Contacts) \n\nA: The best way is to use the Apple supplied sync options - either over USB/WiFi local sync to the Contacts app (Address Book on Lion and earlier) using iTunes or using iCloud.\nFrom there, you can backup / export them as vCard or inject them into Exchange, LDAP or other services. This way the contacts are in a standard / text format as opposed to the internal storage form for iOS or OS X contacts app.\nTo get started in syncing Contacts between iTunes and an iOS device, get your USB cable and open iTunes. From there - type sync contacts into the help menu search field and iTunes help will walk you through the setup. With a few clicks, you should be at a window like this and can turn on the sync for that device.\n\n", "Q: Besides Skim, what OSX PDF viewers support SyncTeX? I hope this question is not a duplicate. I use a lot of pdfLaTeX in my daily work on OSX (10.8). I've been using Skim and its SyncTeX support to preview PDFs and link forward and backward and that's fine. There are a bunch of PDF viewers on OSX and I'm wondering if others also support SyncTeX (commercial or not). I tend to prefer standalone editors and previewers instead of integrated environments such as TeXShop, but I'd like to hear about all types of PDF viewers that offer SyncTeX support. I'm not finding that this information is easily accessible on the web so answers to this question might serve as a handy reference.\nFor starters, it seems the standard OSX Preview doesn't support SyncTeX. Is that correct?\n\nA: If you don't mind using macports you can install okular:\nport install okular \n\nConsider editing the port file if you want to use kile (KDE's TeX editor) as well, as it depends on texlive and most mac users already have a TeXlive installation through MacTeX:\nport edit kde4-kile\n#remove the line which contains texlive\nport install kde4-kile\n\nAfter installing okular (and optionally kile) open okular and go to Settings > Configure Okular > Editor and insert the command to start your favorite editor( %f stands for the path, %l for the line). This question on tex.so describes the setup for kile.\nFinally click on any part of the PDF while holding shift to use reverse sync.  \n\nA: The SyncTex page offers a SyncTex Viewer. Its a free app and works fine on regular PDFs. \n\nA: A popular non-free option is Skim. It supports SyncTEx. \n", "Q: Correct way to backup via Time Machine to a remote Time Capsule If I have a MacBook through which I will like to access a Remote Time Capsule via Back to My Mac in order to perform updates to my Time Machine backup on said Time Capsule, which should be the correct settings o accomplish this?\n\nA: You would want to run a VPN server on the network where the Time Capsule sits so that your remote machine can log in over the internet as if it were a local computer.\nThis pokes holes in the network since most people don't allow their Time Capsule to be reachable by anyone on the internet and have their entire home network hidden behind a router with a local and non-routable internet address.\nOS X server would be an inexpensive and well documented / supported manner of setting up a VPN or sharing any hard drive with others for Time Machine backups as well as enabling a local Time Capsule to be reachable directly by VPN clients.\n", "Q: How to make Google Chrome launch in incognito mode on an Ipad? It's possible to launch Google Chrome in incognito mode on a PC by adding -incognito to the end of the desktop shortcut. Is it possible to launch to Chrome on an iPad in incognito mode?\n\nA: Apple does not allow command line access on iOS. This may be possible with a jailbroken device, but I have never investigated that.\nI looked for a setting in Chrome to allow this and I could not find one on the Desktop settings panel, or in the advanced settings. My thought was that the setting would be synced to iOS and the iOS app would honor that request.\nThe last thing I can think of is to be in an incognito tab when closing the app, that way it will restore that tab when restarting the app. This worked in my testing, although it remembered and reloaded the page it was on.\n", "Q: Can I download all pictures on a page?

This will download the webpage at example.com and all of the resources linked from it (such as images, stylesheets, and scripts). More info on --page-requisites. Note: You can add many URLs separated by spaces to download lots of them at once. If many are from the same server, you should use something like wget --wait=2 to avoid slurping down files too fast.\n\n*Open the folder you downloaded those files to and use Spotlight to separate the images from the other files.

I've seen it mentioned several times to fix issues with some packages, that it installs newer versions of packages somehow. But I've been unable to find a clear explanation of what that option really does, when to use it, why some packages have a --HEAD version to install and why its necessary.\n\nA: I found some information in the Homebrew docs.\nQuoting from under the \"Advanced Formula Tricks\" section:\n\nUnstable versions (HEAD, devel)\nFormulae can specify alternate downloads for the upstream project’s devel release (unstable but not trunk) or HEAD\n  (master/trunk).\nHEAD URLs (activated by passing --HEAD) build the development cutting\n  edge.\n\nHopefully this helps with the what.  I can't help with the why.\n\nA: In git using the --HEAD will grab all of the latest commits from the source repo. The problem with this is sometimes the latest revision will be in an inconsistant or unbuildable state, so use at your own risk. \nWhen you sync from other tags that are published as \"known stable\" releases then the developer is saying that the files as they existed at that point will build and has passed all if its tests.\nRunning from head can be risky.\n", "Q: What happens when I've closed all of an application's windows on OSX? I'm used to Windows, where applications disappear from my task tray, Alt+Tab menu, etc. when I close their last window; so it's a little unexpected to me that an application's icon still sits in my Dock and in my Command+Tab windows.\nDoes the computer's memory, CPU usage, etc. change between that state and when I fully close (e.g. Command+Q) an application? (I have OS X 10.8 if that matters.)\n\nA: The answer already given here is a good answer and very precise, but I just want to break this down into laymen's terms for you. \nSome programs terminate when you close all their window, others do not. Additionally, some programs have an option in settings where you, the user, can decide if you want the program to quit when the last window is closed.\nWith regards to memory usage, OS X uses memory management is designed to funnel the most amount of memory to the foremost (active) app, while restricting how much memory is being used by apps that are not the active app. As was already mentioned, though, how well this works depends largely on how well each individual program was coded.\n\nA: There is no consensus on whether the app must quit when you close the last window or if the app continues to run, so the decision is left to each developer to decide on an app by app basis. What is true is that quitting an app does release the resources it took - even if some files and code are still stored in RAM or cache until those stores get flushed or used for caching other apps and files at a later time.\nFurthermore, there is no restriction prohibiting bad coding, hogging memory, using CPU when no real tasks should be executing, so that as well varies on a case by case basis.\nBoth Windows and OS X have very good scheduling smarts, paging systems, thread control, etc... and the CPU are all the same in terms of shutting down cores and lowering/raising the frequency based on load to save power and give a \"turbo boost\" when only one core is executing a single thread.\nOS X is starting to let apps signal that they support sudden termination - so that the OS can handle automatic termination, sudden termination and automatic document saving (plus versions) for an app developer. So even if you have told the OS to run a program it can and will decide to \"quit\" the process so that it won't consume resources while you are doing other things with the computer.\nLastly, with PowerNap on OS X hardware, the line between alseep and awake begins to blur with the system waking partially to perform periodic network tasks which make OS X a bit different than traditional UNIX and Windows in terms of thinking about apps and resource usage.\nMore reading:\n\n\n*\n\n*The Core App Design - covers both apps that quit when its window closes and those that do not. Further down, the discussion of termination is fairly readable but also technically detailed\n\n*Mountain Lion: About Power Nap - HT5394\n", "Q: Fixing up a HFS+ filesystem enough to rescue some files I have a HFS+ formatted drive that just died on me.

Is it possible to stop Gmail iOS app checking email without me asking for it? \nI don't need the phone to check for emails while I'm in from of my computer.\n\nA: As the GMail app is a third party app not built by Apple, it is not allowed to run in the background to check for mails. So closing the app stops it from checking for mails.\nHowever, it probably will still get notifications about new mails pushed from Google's server. But this notification is not initiated from your phone.\nYou can switch off notifications for the gmail app in the iPhones settings.app under notifications.\n", "Q: Does anybody know an email client for iOS that is password protected? I am looking for an email client, that when opened, asks for a password before showing email messages. Is there such an app available for iOS?\n\nA: I haven't seen an app like that, but if you have a Gmail account you can use 1Password (App Store Link) to access the web interface. The 1Password app is locked by default. This would work with any email account with a webmail interface.\n\nA: Spark client for iOS has ability to set passcode or use FaceID/TouchID.\nCheck Hamburger Menu->Settings->Security\nLink to App Store\n\n\nA: What kind of server are you accessing?

When using dictation on OS X 10.8, if I speak for too long (approx 20 seconds+), the dictation times out and switches off. Worse, it loses (i.e. doesn't \"type\") all the things I've said so far. This is obviously irritating - I have to judge when to stop speaking, hit \"Fn\", let dictation type the text, and start again.\nIs there a way to increase or turn off this timeout?\n\nA: The official answer (which clearly isn't the one you want based on how the question is phrased) is no for OS X 10.8 and earlier. For the initial implementation, dictation on OS X was limited to 30 seconds of audio per transcription event.\n\n\n*\n\n*Mac Basics: Dictation - HT5449\nHopefully this helps others that are looking for an official answer or explanation. On OS X 10.9 (Mavericks), offline dictation and longer dictation are allowed and you can enable it by answering yes when asked if you want enhanced dictation. You can also control it by going to the Dictation tab of the Speech & Dictation system preference pane:\n\n\nA: You need to enable enhanced dictation in the dictation area of settings. Your mac will then download a fairly hefty (750MB ish) file. This will allow you to dictate off line, and to keep talking to your mac indefinately.  You will need additional downloads for thinks like Australian English.

I had a iPad mini(miniA) several months ago, and I got a new iPad mini(miniB) recently. On miniB's first run, when I was asked whether to set it up as a new device or restore from a backup, I chose to restore from miniA's backup and have iTunes to do the restore. Some days later, I find a problem: When I assign miniB to use a different FaceTime email address, miniA's original FaceTime email address gets lost and be automatically set to miniB's! Also, changes to miniB will be sync-ed to miniA -- quite unexpected. \nIs there any Apple official document describing this restore-and-sync behavior.\nYes, I really want miniA and miniB to use different FaceTime email addresses -- and I know of course they can, because my iPhone is using a different FaceTime email address than that on miniA . And the worst way I can imagine is factory reset my miniB then set it up as a new device. I'd like to know, is there other solution without wiping off miniB?\nBTW: miniA, miniB and my iPhone all use the same Apple ID to access FaceTime service.\n\nA: I think the only way you could do this is if, after you've synced all you want to miniB, change the iCloud account associated with the device (Settings > iCloud > Account > Enter new account info).\nI have not tried this, but just at quick glance, I'm thinking it may work. Please let me know your results! If that doesn't work, we can try something else.\n\nA: I consult my local apple support(Shanghai China) on phone today. An senior support staff tells me that it's true I have to factory reset my miniB in order to stop the auto-sync with miniA. Another workaround is to apply for a new Apple ID for my miniB's Facetime functionality -- which is not desired by me(I just want to only one Apple ID).\nI asks whether I can know from apple ID's account portal which of my Apple devices are being auto-synced and which are not.

Please give me the keywords. All I found were articles about merging (the pages of) different PDFs into one file.\n\nA: You can do this simply with Adobe Acrobat Professional. I tested this with Acrobat Professional version 8.3.1 on my Mac OS X 10.5.8 system.\nPick one of the annotated files to aggregate the comments. Open it with Adobe Acrobat Professional. For each of the other files, select the menu command Comments... Import Comments..., and from the resulting File Open dialog select each of the other files in turn. Acrobat will read the comments from the selected file and place them into the first file. A Comments List opens at the bottom of the window, showing all the comments in the document.\nYou now have a PDF file with all the comments in it. Save it under a different file name, and carry on with your work.\nNote that you make this much easier for Acrobat if everyone marks up the same PDF file. Acrobat can import comments from one version of a document to a different version of a document, but it the comments won't always end up in the right place. The menu command Comments... Migrate Comments... is intended to help you get comments from the PDF form of an older document to the PDF form of a newer revision.\nAcrobat Help content has useful entries for Import Comments.\nIn my humble opinion, every knowledge worker who touches PDF files should have a copy of Acrobat Professional (not just the free Reader). I may be biased — I worked for Adobe for many years, and I still hold their stock. But I believe that being able to do operations like importing and combining comments is hugely valuable for knowledge workers.\n\nA: If you have Adobe Acrobat Pro you can:\n\n\n*\n\n*open one of the pdf you want to merge\n\n*open the menu Comments (top right) \n\n*under \"Comments List\" click on the option icon cf the printscreen\n\n*select Import data file and select the second pdf\n\n\n\n\nA: Another option is to print the PDF file (Cmd+P) and then in the printing dialog save the file as PDF again. This merges the annotations.\n\nA: I have found a  free solution. You can merge comments using Foxit Reader. on Comment tab and choose import on Manage Comment section.\n\nAfter that, chooes pdf type in browse file.\n\n\nA: For iOS, the Xodo editor has \"flatten\" functionality that will make your annotations permanent.\n", "Q: Thunderbolt 27\" resolution I have a mid-2012 Macbook Pro with Retina. I love it, but I needed more screen real-estate for my current work, so I got a 27\" Thunderbolt display. It's very big, and I have lots of room now, but I do have a problem. If I use the native resolution (2560 X 1440), I find text everywhere to be slightly too small. If I try the next \"step\" in the Display options (2048 X 1152), the text is bigger alright, but of course, it gets too blurry. Is there some way of doing an \"in-between\" step, between the native and the 2nd step? Or are there other ways of slightly enlarging the text? I guess I could \"zoom\" in Chrome, for example. Any other similar suggestions for other programs?\n\nA: The display is crispest at it's native resolution of 2560 X 1440. I would suggest adjusting the text size in each app. This is a bit of a pain because it seems that some apps render the same font/size combo differently. Most apps seem to have font/size adjustments with some, like Mail.app, having adjustments for each of the major control areas (mailboxes, summary, mail display).\nThere are third party apps like SwitchRes that may show you intermediate steps. When I run a monitor at a non-native resolution I get a headache in about 5 minutes. The only exception to this is on my Macbook Pro Retina running the \"More Space\" (1920X1200) setting in the Display preference panel.\n\nA: Well, in most applications you can just hit CMD-equalsign or CMD-plussign to increase the font size.\nIt is not an optimal solution, but it's what I'm doing all the time.\n", "Q: New hard drive in Mac Book Pro leading to occasional crashes and kernel panics Ok, this is kind of a long story because I don't know what facts are relevant.  \nI fell off my bike and my 2010 13\" MacBook Pro receives blunt trauma.   It's in a protective sleeve so I don't think about it.  I arrive at school and the computer wakes up from sleep and works, but I can't save anything and it's giving me weird hard drive errors.  So I restart.  Then the computer gets stuck on the Apple start up screen indefinitely.  No matter what I do I can't get it to start up.  \nEverything else works fine.  I can run it off of the Mac OS X CD.  The guys at the fake Apple store (I live in Israel) can run it off an external hard drive.  They tell me it's a hard drive problem and give me a way too high price to fix it.\nSo I buy my own hard drive.  Its a Seagate 750 GB 2.5 inch, but I don't think it's important.\nLuckily I had backed up recently to an external HD.  So my sister and I installed the new Hard Drive (easier than I thought!), reinstalled OS X, and then got all my stuff from the back up.\nNow everything works well.  Or seems to.  Until Chrome crashes giving me some error about my user profile.  Then when I try to open Firefox it says it can't be opened because it's already open (which it isn't).  Then Microsoft Word gives me an error that has to do with not enough memory.  Then I get long stretches of a rotating beach ball while my computer thinks. Sometimes I also get a Kernel Panic.  \nI tried running disk warrior.  I tried running disk utilities.  I tried erasing the hard drive and starting again.  I still get crashes.  I usually restart before I get to Kernel Panics but I can feel them coming.\nI don't see any pattern to when it happens.  Sometimes I use my computer for hours straight - streaming music and playing games - with no problem.  Sometimes it crashes right away.  There are no other problems.  I can save files to the HD no problem.\nAny ideas?  What else can I try?\n\nA: Try resetting NVRAM just to be safe. I do this whenever I service a MacBook.\nResetting NVRAM / PRAM\n1. Shut down your Mac.\n2. Locate the following keys on the keyboard: Command (⌘), Option, P, and R. You will need to hold these keys down simultaneously in step 4.\n3. Turn on the computer.\n4. Press and hold the Command-Option-P-R keys before the gray screen appears.\n5. Hold the keys down until the computer restarts and you hear the startup sound for the second time.\n6. Release the keys.\nYou may also want to make sure your RAM chips didn't dislodge when you dropped it. Here's how to find your RAM bank.\nHope this helps!\n\nA: Along with the suggestions above from Bart and Thomas, I would also recommend you run Disk Utility and repair permissions.  It is possible that some permissions are not correct after the restore from your backup.  This would cause some of the issues you are seeing.\nAs for Firefox, that is an issue with it locking the profile when it is running.  If the app or your system crashes, it doesn't have a chance to release the lock.  Do a Google search for \"Firefox locked profile\" and you will find many posts about how to manually fix it.\n", "Q: Is there a way to see who created an event in a shared iCal calendar? I'm using iCal to share numerous calendars with my wife.  We're using iCloud to sync them.\nOn occasion, I need to know which of us put an appointment on the calendar, but can't remember.  \nI know that somewhere, the system is capturing the creator, because notifications tells me that \"[EVENT] has been added to the Calendar by [User].\"\nBut I can't find a way to retrieve that user info from the appointment itself.  \"Get info\" would often be source of this kind of data in OSX, but in iCal, it's just the same info as you see in the full appointment view.  \nIs there somewhere else I can find this?\n\nA: In Calendar (on Mountain Lion), if you right click on the event to view the details, one of the invitees is marked as \"(organizer)\"\n", "Q: Sharing settings report (security audit) I am new to Mac administration and struggling somewhat on how to programatically report in the settings in the Sharing Preference panel (10.7 and 10.8). Basically - I want to report in which settings are on and off. I have imagined writing a script to be able to report this status back. \nI can see that for some of the settings I can use 'systemsetup' (remote login, remote Apple Events) but for others I am at a loss to where to go check to see if the following options are enabled:\n\n\n*\n\n*DVD and CD Sharing\n\n*Screen Sharing\n\n*File Sharing (both for AFP and SMB)\n\n*Printer Sharing\n\n*Scanner Sharing\n\n*Remote Management\n\n*Internet Sharing\n\n*Bluetooth Sharing\n\n\nI am less concerned about if the service is active (i.e. currently in use by someone) but initially want to just report if the options are checked on.\n\nA: While I applaud the effort to learn how to collect these scripts, I would say you might just buy a copy of Apple's Remote Desktop tool.\nIt has pre-built data collection tools that will collect thousands of data points about each system, periodically get updates and you can run reports against the local database of last known configurations or tick a checkbox to refresh all status and then run the report.\nHere is how the interface for what you ask looks:\n\nThat tool leverages ssh log in, remote apple events and Apple's own remote management hooks to be extremely flexible and running arbitrary shell scripts, custom packages, remote Apple Scripts as well as performing more direct data collection that is embedded into the OS.\nThe reports and data collected are all easily printed, copied or exported in tab/comma separated files for ease of re-use.\n", "Q: How to disable voice dictation on an iPhone 4S running iOS 5.1 or later? When the keyboard is active on my iPhone 4S (running jailbroken iOS 5.1.1 / 6.1.1), there is a key between the space bar and the numeric entry toggle. This key has a microphone on it and tapping it opens voice dictation.\nHow do you prevent this key from showing up?\nNote that the instructions at http://osxdaily.com/2012/05/04/turn-off-dictation-on-ipad-iphone/ do not work; the Keyboard menu does not contain a Dictation toggle.\n\nA: There are four things that you can try:\nDisable Siri\nYou can disable Dictation by disabling Siri. Navigate to Settings > General > Siri and turn Siri \"Off\".\nUpdate PList File\nHowever, understandably, you may want to use Siri, and since you have a jailbroken phone, this appears possible by editing a .plist.\nAs per this MacRumors post, edit the file /User/Library/Preferences/com.apple.keyboard.plist. Edit it to add the following lines inside of the <dict> block:\n<key>DictationOnSpaceKey</key>\n<false/>\n\nUpdate a different file\nUsing iFile, edit the file /Users/Library/ConfigurationProfiles/UserSettings.plist\nSet restrictedBool > allowDictation > value to Off or false. It should look like this:\n<key>allowDictation</key>\n<dict>\n  <key>value</key>\n  <false/>\n</dict>\n\nInstall \"NoDictation\"\nNoDictation is a free jailbreak tweak available from the BigBoss repos (available by default on most iOS jailbreaks). If neither of the previous options work, it may.\n\nA: Settings > General > Keyboard > Enable Dictation - Switch it to off.\n\nA: Disabling Siri is the only way I can think of. Go to Settings > General > Siri > slide the switch to Off\n", "Q: My new iMac connects to my router, but not to the internet. How to fix? I have a 3 week old 2012 27-inch iMac and this morning I turned it on and it wouldn't connect to the internet. It connected to my home network just fine, just not the internet. I assumed it was my router's fault, but every other device in the house connected to the internet just fine. I have already tried turning it off and on again, many times, as with my router. I have also tried turning the Wi-Fi off and on in System Preferences. Any help?\n\nA: You are connecting your Mac to the router via WiFi.\nThe first thing to check is that your Mac is asking for an IP address and your router is giving it one.\nOpen System Preferences > Network and select \"Wi-Fi\" in the left hand pane. On the right is should say \"Wi-Fi is connected to [router name] and has the IP address [IP address]\"\nIf it does you have a deeper problem, if it doesn't say that but instead says it has a self-assigned address that start with 169 then you have a DHCP problem.\nClick on the \"Advanced…\" button at bottom right and in the Advanced pane click on \"TCP/IP\". Make sure that \"Configure IPv4\" is set to \"Using DHCP\" and then click on \"Renew DHCP Lease\" and see if you now get a good address.\nif you are getting a good address from your router then try something simple, run \"ping -c 5 google.com\" on the command line and you should see ping send and receive 5 packets.\nIf neither of those work then please run ifconfig at the command line and you will see a number of blocks starting with an interface name of \"en\" followed by a number. Your wireless is probably \"en1\" or \"en0\". Paste this output into your question and we will have a look at it.\n\nA: By \"turn it on/ off,\" do you mean you rebooted the computer? Apple sign in the top left corner > Restart. Sorry if this seems obvious. Just have to start simplest first. \nIf you have tried rebooting, try the following:\n1. Unplug your modem and router\n2. Wait a full minute\n3. Plug in your modem\n4. Wait a full minute\n5. Plug in your router\n6. Wait a full minute\n7. Check internet connections now\n", "Q: Changing Apple ID on iPhone - how is non-iTunes data affected? My sister's iPhone had been irreversibly damaged. When she got a new one some time later, she had forgotten her Apple ID's password and created a new one. I managed to reset the password just yesterday, and she'd like to use the old account again, as she's bought many apps with it.\nHow would changing the account affect all data unrelated to the Apple ID on the phone, like call history and text messages? Are they somehow tied to the account, or can she simply change the account both on the phone and the computer and create a new backup without losing anything*?\n* Except the apps from the new account, of course. No problem, she only downloaded free ones.\n\nA: Any purchases that she made with the previous account are the biggest problem as they are non-transferable. This would include music and movies, as well as apps. Since you mentioned that she only downloaded free apps, it shouldn't be a monetary problem. Because updates will require you to login to the old account, it would probably be better to re-download the apps with the new account. That way updates are seamless and easy.\niMessage (or SMS and MMS for that matter) shouldn't be a problem at all. All the old threads and messages should stay in tact and be usable like nothing ever changed. Call history isn't something that iCloud, or an Apple ID has anything to do with, so the change will also be without consequence there.\nYes, change Apple IDs, create a new backup and you're good to go. \nSide note: iPhone actually handles Apple ID changes very easily and smoothly. Some people have two Apple IDs in general - most by accident - and they will change back and forth for app/music/movies purchases. \n\nA: Shouldn't affect data already on the phone at all. She MAY run into an issue with apps and music after she enters the other AppleID and starts downloading new content though. You can only sync one AppleID per device. What I think will happen is, all the purchases from the old account will stay on the device, but not be updated. Someone correct me if that's wrong.\n\nA: On mobile devices os 10 lets you keep the iCloud seperate from the Store. You can get that option when you do the update after the Hello startup. \n", "Q: find what's producing inactive memory First of all i'd like to ask politely for all of those who feel the need to explain it to me how perfect apple's memory management is to ignore this thread.\nA little background:\nThe theory goes that if you have lots of inactive memory - it's can be freed for applications that need it. It's like free memory according to apple and their blind followers. And i like the idea of it, but... in practice: when free memory hits low numbers and inactive hits high numbers - osx (at least snow leopard) slows down ... So even if the inactive memory is being freed - it is done very very slow and that's not acceptable.\nBut for some reason the problem has just gotten worse for me: i've just noticed that inactive memory keeps piling up faster than ever. I've done a couple of purges just to confirm my theory and ... the number gets high again very fast ...\nSo until apple fixes whatever is wrong with their memory management - i'd at least like to know which apps are producing the inactive memory.\nIs there a way to somehow monitor processes and see how much memory they allocate and free during their lifetime?\nThanks for your thoughts\n\nA: I have had some success using the terminal command top.  Much the same results as Activity Monitor, but I can slow down the update speed, and sort on any field.\nIn my experience, the problem is usually with individual programs that fail to free memory. You will see the memory for that process creep up.  See 'man top' for details about the various fields that top reports.  Firefox is notorious for this, and with 60 or so tabs requires a restart every few days\nIf you want to dig deeper, vmmap can give you the status of pages owned by a particular process.  \nBe warned:  sometimes slowdowns are CPU related.  Sometimes disk i/o related, althoth the latter is less common with current memory prices.\n", "Q: What is the keyboard shortcut to insert a comment during track changes in Word? When I am editing a Word document using track changes it would be nice not to have to got to the mouse to insert a comment at the cursor (since this is most of what my editing consists of). \nWhat is the keyboard shortcut to insert a comment at the cursor in MS Word on a Mac when using track changes?\nI am running Word 14.2.5 and OS X 10.5.8\n\nA: Insert a comment\n⌘+OPTION+A\nTurn track changes on or off\n⌘+SHIFT+E\nFrom here\n\nA: They actually do post it: They won't let me post without 30 characters, otherwise this would just be the link:\nhttp://office.microsoft.com/en-us/mac-word-help/word-keyboard-shortcuts-HA102929541.aspx\n", "Q: Should I enable Trim for SSD drives in Windows / VirtualBox? I understand that Trim exists for OSX Mountain Lion, but is there anything I should do for Windows on Virtualbox in this regard?\n\nA: No. The Mac OS handles the physical drive - so any sort of second level defragmentation, optimizations or attempts of a guest OS to control the virtual file system driver would just add delay and complexity on top of the normal IO. Unless you were booting Windows directly in control of the SSD, this setting should be off.\n", "Q: iPhone 3GS suddenly shuts down while playing games I just purchased used iPhone 3GS from a fella, and the phone is running everything perfectly except for games. Whenever I play any game after some minute it suddenly shut down, even battery is fully charge.\nIt is an iPhone 3GS, 32GB, SU, old BR, 5.1.\nWhat possibly is the cause of this issue?\n\nA: Usually when an iOS device suddenly powers off, it's a voltage drop in the battery due to a hardware problem. If the device draws more current than the battery can provide, it will shut off.\nAre you able to take it in for service to have the device checked out? You could chase a software restore, but those usually leave a log file or the device reboots on its own. Also, over temp could cause the issue, but the device logs that and shows an over temp error on the display rather than just blacking out most of the times heat is a cause.\n", "Q: Can you export/capture the contents of a Genius Mix? In iTunes, I know you can save a Genius Playlist, and you can see a few songs ahead in a Genius Mix by looking at Up Next, but is there any way to actually save a Genius-Mix-generated playlist?\nOr is it that the Genius Mix playlist doesn't even exist (more than the few songs in Up Next)?  Like, is iTunes just popping another random song (of the appropriate category) on the end of the list?\n\nA: You can do so with this AppleScript.\n\nA: This script will copy the tracks of a playing Genius Mix playlist to a new \"dumb\" (regular) playlist, which, for example, can be copied/sync'd to older iPods that do not accommodate Genius Mixes. You can subsequently copy the contents of additional Genius Mix playlists to the new playlist, refill it, or create more. (Each Genius Mix playlist only contains about 70 tracks maximum, which is why you may have several, say, \"Rock Mix\" playlists.)\nDoug's Script:  http://dougscripts.com/itunes/scripts/ss.php?sp=dumbdowngeniusmix\n", "Q: My iMac suddenly crashed when I turned off my Bluetooth headset.

I just bought a new Pioneer XW-SMA3 AirPlay speaker system but have so-far been unable to connect it to my home WiFi Network. The speakers come with an Ethernet port so I am able to connect it via that and configure it, but nothing I do will connect it to the wireless.\nMy home network is served up from an Apple Airport Extreme (bought at the end of 2011) secured via WPA2 Personal (all my other devices connect to this just fine including the Wii, iPhones, friends' windows boxes etc) as per the following screen snap (SSID obscured):\n\nWhen I configure the speakers I am given the following security options:\n\nHowever when I choose WPA2-PSK(AES) (which I am told is the equivalent to Apple's WPA2 Personal and reboot, the speakers still don't connect and when I reconnect via Ethernet the config shows me that it's selected WPA-PSK(AES) instead. See:\n\nI've tried dumbing my network security down to WPA/WPA2 Personal but that made no difference, and I've also tried selecting the WPA2-PSK(TKIP) option in the speakers' config but when it reboots it shows as WPA-PSK(TKIP) instead, analogous to the AES setting.\nI have also tried updating the speakers' firmware to the latest version just to be sure but it made no difference.\nI've triple checked the obvious things like the SSID name and the password.\nI lodged a technical support request with Pioneer but got no answer, and so today I phoned them and they told me that “We are not networking specialists. We can't help you.” which is utterly useless.\nI am hoping someone here has succeeded in connecting these speakers to their WiFi.  Googling the problem gives me no sensible results.\n\nA: My speakers are now on my wifi.  A bloke called Jason from Pioneer called me this morning and told me to ignore the manual and instead to do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Turn the unit off and unplug it from Ethernet and power.\n\n*Plug the power back in and turn the unit back on — wait for it to power up again.\n\n*Plug your iOS device (assumes you have one, and that it is currently connected to your wifi) into the USB port in the back of the speakers and unlock the iOS device so that it shows the home screen.\n\n*Press and hold the Input button at the front right of the speakers, along with the hidden little black button on the back labelled • Network Setup / - wireless direct, and keep both held down for about 3 seconds.\n\n*A dialog box will appear on your iOS device saying \"A connected device wants to share your network settings (cancel) or (allow).\"\n\n*Press (allow).\n\n*Wait about 10 seconds and open the Music app on your iOS device and click on the AirPlay icon.  Your speakers will appear in the list of available speakers.\n\n*You can now unplug your iOS device as the speakers are connected to your wifi.\n\n\nI actually had to try this process twice to get it to work but now it's working perfectly.  In Safari on your Mac under the Bonjour menu in Bookmarks your speaker will appear and you can then perform any other configuration you like, such as giving the speakers a more sensible name.\n\nA: It might be worth sniffing the air with something like Kismac http://kismac-ng.org/ so see what is going on with the SSID you are trying to connect to, and also see what the speakers think they are doing.\n\nA: Alternatively set up another Access Point (AP) in the same address range as your network and see if it will connect to that AP, surely you have a few APs laying around.\nTry asking in one of the Community Wireless Groups like http://www.air-stream.org, there might be a community wireless ground in Canberra that can help you out.\n\nA: Pioneer wireless speaker might be incompatible with your router.\nTry to disable N(5gHz) network\n", "Q: SEO'd iTunes Preview of App from Wrong Region I've recently released UBCme onto the app store. The problem is that I accidentally shared the US store link which doesn't have any ratings because all my users are from Canada. Thus, the top google hit for UBCme returns the US link which doesn't show the customer ratings. The first thing I did was replace all my advertisement links with the Canadian link, but I worry that it's too late.\nHas anybody made this misstep before? How did you rectify it? \nI feel reluctant to re-announce my app everywhere, but is it the only way I can fix this? Is there anything Apple can do to redirect pages?\n\nA: The name of the store is embedded in the store link and I highly doubt whether Apple would apply a redirect especially for your application. So the best course of action is to redestribute the correct link.\nUsers from Canada will need to buy the app from the Canadian store anyway so they will get redirected to the store with the ratings. But of course this isn't the case if you follow the link in the browser.\n", "Q: Can't rate apps/music/etc in iTunes or App Store I'm unable to rate anything in either iTunes, the Mac app store, or the iOS app store.  If I rate an app 5 stars (or anything else), and then return to the search results, then go back to the app page the rating widget will appear as if I hadn't rated the app.  The rating count does not increase either.  It's has been happening for a while.  I only just noticed the behavior a week or two ago when I got my iPad, but it may have been an issue before that on my Mac.\nI'm assuming something may be wrong with my Apple ID, but I dont know what it could be.\n\nA: Apple blocked your account. You can still download apps but cannot post reviews or rate them\n", "Q: Accessing Russian App store My mother is Russian, she lives with me but does not speak a word of English. I'm considering buying her an iPad for her birthday, but I have concerns since Russian apps would be hard to find in US app store. Is there a way I could access the Russian app store? \nI tried a few online app search websites but as it is now, most of the games she would be interested in come in multiple languages and as soon as I open them in iTunes they switch to English. \nAny suggestions?\n\nA: *\n\n*To use the Russian App Store you need to create an account there using whatever payment method is available. Apple matches credit cards to country so you'll need a card issued in Russia to buy any apps\n\n*Multi-lingual apps use the language configured on the phone. So even if you buy an app in the US store it will switch to Russian if running on such an iPhone (at least as long as the developers translated it to Russian in the first place)\n\n", "Q: Can I use a Time Capsule as an all-purpose storage disk? I have a MacBook Pro and am thinking of buying a Time Capsule. If I do, will I be able to use it as a backup and storage disk, and as a wireless router? I read somewhere that they can be used only as backup disks (I don't need one that much) and routers. I would also like an external hard disk to keep my photos and old stuff, though.\nAdditionally, do Time Capsules support connecting over PPPoE?\n\nA: Yes. Time Capsules can be used for Time Machine backups as well as for general storage, though Apple recommends against it:\n\nTime Machine works best if you use your backup disk only for Time Machine backups. If you keep files on your backup disk, Time Machine won’t back up those files, and the space available for Time Machine backups is reduced.\n\nI personally don't believe that they will “work better” if you only use them for backups—I haven't had any problems with my setup, and it's been this way for a few years—but that's what the official knowledge base says.\nIt's easy to get at the general storage. I have disk accounts set up, so the way you do it might be somewhat different. My Time Capsule appears in Finder's left sidebar. When I click on it, two items appear: one with my username and one with the Time Capsule's disk's name. I double-click on the first one, and (after waiting a few seconds for the disk to spin up again,) I get a list of the files I've stored there. Finder also puts an icon on the desktop, which I can use to quickly get back to it. When I'm done, I either drag that icon to the trash, or click the eject icon next to the Time Capsule's name in any Finder window.\n\nTime Capsules do seem to support PPPoE for Internet connections: in AirPort Utility's Internet tab, there is an option for PPPoE in the Connect Using drop-down box. I can't be 100% sure of this, though: my ISP doesn't use it.\n\n(Everything here was copied from my three comments.)\n\nA: As noted in Blacklight's answer, it's not recommended; but you can do it, and everything will work, just not optimally. Here's an explanation on why this might not be the best to do. \nFirst, it makes sense Time Capsule wouldn't back up files stored directly on it.  Where would it back them up—to itself, the same drive? That's not a backup of great value, but this isn't a true negative. \nThe bigger issue is that it's using a shared physical disk, with one potentially greedy process: Time Machine. It has nothing to do at all with network/wifi performance.\nAs you're trying to share the same disk, if Time Machine has many unpredictable reading/writing input/output occurring in the background, accessing other files on the same physical disk that Time Machine is accessing could result in sporadic performance hits. If Time Machine slows, no great worry, the user doesn't watch this background process. But if it takes too long to download/stream a large movie file because a heavy Time Machine write is simultaneously occurring, the user would think the performance of the Time Capsule was to blame. Apple doesn't want you to think its products are of poor quality, so they recommend you use them in ways that optimize perceived performance.\nIf you accept the possibility of slow access for stored items due to Time Machine commonly writing to the same disk, it should work fine (outside less space for the Time Machine image).\nHowever, if you're expecting blazing and consistent access to content, don't use the same disk you're using Time Machine for anything else. Not even if you partition it. Get a separate drive, connect it to the Time Capsule, and use that.  The second disk will not be affected by Time Machine's reading and writing processes. \n\nA: I think the answer why they don't recommend it is quite simple. Your backuped data are always in two places, on your Mac and on your TC. The TC only has one disk so if you don't have the data on your Mac and the TC crash you are in trouble. If you want a home storage solution and a backup I recommend a NAS with time machine server included.\n\nA: One issue to consider is the speed of transfer to the Time Capsule - if you connect over Ethernet your files get backed up at the speed of the Ethernet connection (1000Mbit/sec or 100Mbit/sec or even 10Mbit/sec). \nIf connected to the Time Capsule over WiFI that is another limitation depending on the speed of your WiFi. If you have an external USB 2.0 or 3.0 drive or a Thunderbolt drive the speed varies from 450Mbit/sec for USB 2.0, 5Gbit/sec for USB 3.0, and up to 10Gbit/sec for the newest Thunderbolt and USB 3.1 (these rates are maximum best case scenario and real speeds can be much less depending on cables or other limitations of the electronic interface). \nYou also have to consider the actual speed of the drive inside and that is usually less than the higher bandwidth interfaces like Thunderbolt and USB 3. Typically a good conventional spinning drive might be 50-120MB/sec and SSD drives can run at 200-500MB/sec.\n", "Q: How do I un-claim a Time Machine backup? I recently wiped my Time Capsule and started a new set of backups. After a couple of weeks, Time Machine reported that “to improve reliability”, it needed to start over—again. My understanding is that this is caused by a filesystem error so bad it can't be identified, let alone fixed, so one would have to start anew.\nThis is all very well, but there doesn't seem to be an option to start backing up again without erasing the existing backup image. I'd like to keep it around for a while.\nIs there any way to un-claim a Time Machine backup?\n\nA: I had this a long time ago, so I am not 100% sure that I remember the solution correctly, but I think it was rather simple:\nRename the existing backup image or tuck it away in a folder.\n", "Q: iTunes Redownload Music I have purchased an album in iTunes, but it still shows the price in the store. Does this mean that the next time I want to redownload the music I'll need to pay for it again?\nI have experienced purchased apps with iTunes, and I didn't need to repurchase the items. But for the music album, I'm not sure about the rules of purchase.\n\n\nA: A while back (maybe two years ago), I ran into the same situation.  I had to e-mail apple support before I could re-download it.  They warned me, saying that I should make backups, and that next time I would have to purchase the music again.  As it turns out, I actually did lose the music a second time (because I was an idiot), and sure enough they wouldn't let me re-download it.\nPerhaps their policy has changed now that cloud computing was so prevalent, but it may be worth a try e-mailing them.\n\nA: My guess is that iTunes in the cloud isn't available in the country where your Apple store account is located.\nSee this article that explains how to re-download content for free:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://support.apple.com/kb/HT2519\nIt has a linked article that lists the countries where this service is available:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5085\nSo, if your account is based in Anguila or Armenia - you are good to go, but if you are based from Albania or Angola you need to pay each time you download the music.\n", "Q: iTunes 11 doesn't remember to show cloud purchases On this particular computer, I use iTunes 11 only with my cloud purchases – I don't have any music stored locally. Very often (but not always), when I launch iTunes, it comes up with an empty library because the preference setting to display cloud purchases is switched to off.\nI keep switching the preference back on, yet it keeps disabling itself again in the future. Is there any way to get it to stick?\n\nUpdate: even weirder, sometimes when this happens the checkbox to show or hide cloud purchases (in Preferences > Store) actually disappears. Literally, I go into Preferences and it simply isn't there. If I quit and relaunch multiple times, eventually it comes back and then I can reenable it. I'll take a screenshot the next time this happens.\n\nA: I had this exact problem so I telephoned Apple support and the first thing they told me to do was to check the same setting on my other devices. I discovered that my iMac had the option in preferences un-checked and it seems that this was over-riding the option on my MacBook Air. \nThis has worked for me, so I suggest that you check the preferences on any other devices you have and make them all the same. This is probably a bug that Apple need to sort out because if you want the option on one device but not the other then you will cause the conflict.\n\nA: I know this is an old post, but I encountered the same problem so this is for anyone else with this issue.\nTo correct it, you need to access your iTunes account from within iTunes.\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to iTunes Store > Quick Links > Account.\n\n*It will ask for your password again.\n\n*Login, then go to Edit > Preferences > Store.\n\n*You should now see the option to enable iCloud music.\n\n\nA: I fixed the issue of the disappearing button in 11.1.2, by quitting iTunes and re-opening.\n", "Q: Can't access AppStore when connected via 3G When my iPhone (3GS) is connected via 3G, I can't connect to the AppStore. It just loads a while and then says \"Could not connect\" and that's that.\nWhen I have a WLAN connection, everything works fine.\nThis has been like this for quite some time now - it also didn't change after rebooting or updating to new versions of iOS.\nWhat's going wrong there? \n\nA: I also had a problem where the App Store was working on Wi-Fi, but not on 3G and 4G networks. I solved it by going into:\nSettings → Mobile Data (also called Cellular). Under the heading Use Mobile Data For, enable App Store.\n", "Q: How to tell if the iphone 5 is connected to the 2.4 or 5 ghz network? I just got a new 5th generation apple airport extreme and I set it up in the dual band mode and I am wondering if it is possible to see which frequency the iphone 5 is connecting to. I know that on the computer you can hold down option when clicking on the wifi menu, but I would really like to know which one my iphone is connecting to.\n\nA: See the answers to this similar question.\nSince you are using an AirPort Extreme, you can set up a separate SSID for the 5GhZ-network and connect to that one manually on your phone, and from there be able to see which network you're on. To do this, follow the below step:\n\nAirport Utility 6.0: Airport Extreme > Edit > Wireless > Wireless Options > Tick the box next to \"5GHz network name\".\n  Airport Utility 5.6 and earlier: Manual Setup > Wireless > Wireless Network Options > Tick the box.\n  Source\n\nP.S. Having a different SSID does not make it a separate network, it just makes the two bands differentiable.\n", "Q: \"Re\"-download 10.8 After Purchase of a New Mac I recently purchased a new Macbook Air which obviously came with Mountain Lion. I am wondering if there is a way to download the installer for free onto another computer I have to create a re-install disk from, without having to pay the $20 to download from the Mac App Store.\n\nA: You can download Apple's official OSX Recovery Disk assistant to create a flash drive with the capability to re-install OSX on an eligible Apple computer. A flash drive (it must be larger then 1GB) also enables you to easily re-install OSX on products such as the MacBook Air which don't have optical drives. \nThere is also a support document about the Recovery Disk Assistant. \n", "Q: How to enable disk access on Ipad mini? I remember there used to be a check box that allows \"enable disk access\", but now iTunes 10 has taken away that check box. What should I do if I want to enable my Ipad mini for disk access (preferably without using a 3rd party software..)?\n\nA: Enable Disk Access was a feature on the iPods, but has never been an option on the iPhone, iPod Touch, or iPad.\n\nA: Some jailbreak-only tweaks have allowed for creating a disk image to be made accessible as a standard flash drive over USB, but their historical records in compatibility - both relatively to iOS updates and towards Windows systems- is very poor. For that matter, none of them is known to work on iOS 6.1.\n", "Q: Odd text before \":\" in Terminal In Terminal.app I have a text prompt like the following\nrover-205-89:Documents username$ \n\nWhat is the \"rover-205-89\"? I thought it was my computer name but I looked under System Preferences > Sharing and that isn't it.\n\nA: That is your computer's hostname. In Terminal type the command hostname and that is what you'll see. You can change the host name with the command sudo scutil --set HostName desired-host-name. There are some networking scenarios where this won't permanently fix the problem, though. (e.g. OS X assumes hostname of other network computer: how to prevent this?). It happens with my machine at work (on a Windows domain). Aside from being a little disconcerting, there are no functional repercussions that I've experienced.\n", "Q: Is it possible to restore individual app data (over iCloud)? I am upgrading to a new iPhone 5 from an iPod touch, and I want a shiny new, fresh install.\nI would rather not restore the whole shebang from my tired old, disorganized, app-laden, settings-broken iPod data to the new phone.\nI'd like to re-download the dozen-or-so apps I actually use… and then restore the data for just those apps (preferably from iCloud, but iTunes would be fine).\nWhat are my options? \n\nA: This is reasonably possible with a little configuration work on your old iPod Touch. The key will be to turn off everything except what you want on your new iPhone. Also, there is some possibility that miscellaneous settings and such will sync over. However, we should have control of basically everything.\nAnother important note is that the restore cannot be done after you set it up as a new device without re-wiping the device. iCloud, unfortunately, doesn't allow selective restore, but it does allow selective backup. \nWhat you will need to do is open your Settings app on your iPod Touch and select \"iCloud\". Go down through that first list and disable everything there. I'd probably leave \"Photostream\", \"Documents and Data\", as well as \"Find my iPhone\" enabled. If you would like \"Contacts\", \"Calendars\" and such synced over, go ahead and leave those switches on as well.\nNext go down and select \"Storage and Backup\" > \"Manage Storage\". Leave all the Documents and Data enabled there - those will only be referenced/downloaded if you have the applicable app. But, if you desired, you could disable some of these as well.\nNow select your iPod above \"Documents and Data\" and start working through the list. Turn off everything you don't want, and leave on anything you want. This could take several minutes as you will have to choose to delete all the unneeded data.\nIf you happen to turn off a switch accidentally that you want left on, turn it back on and perform a manual backup. That should re-send the data to iCloud. \nAgain, while this may happen to sync things that you didn't really want restored - like settings - I can't think of anything that would do that. Either way, this is the control we have. \nAfter all the above is complete, wipe the iPhone 5, restore it from your iPod Touch backup, and configure your iPhone 5 to backup. You can now go through and re-enable everything on your iPod Touch as it will be listed as a different backup and will no longer affect your iPhone's current data situation.\nAnd, of course, congratulations on your new iPhone\n\nA: Indirectly this is easy by deleting the un-wanted apps and making a new backup. I prefer to be cautious so I leave the original device alone and make a final backup if needed of the full data:\n\n\n*\n\n*Restore everything to the new device.\n\n*Once the data is on the device, the apps start loading.\n\n*Once the apps are done loading, delete the things you don't want. It will delete both the app and all your data for the unwanted apps.\n\n*If you don't trust that things are properly cleaned, at this point make a back up to iCloud (or locally) and wipe the device and repeat, dropping the thinned backup onto the new device. I've not seen this save much if any measurable space and file placement on solid-state storage isn't as important as it was on HDD for speed reasons, so this step might be totally a waste of time on iOS 6 and later.\n\n\nThis seems faster for me and my time than going into the iCould storage settings and deleting the app backups for each un-wanted item on the originating device. The benefit for me of pruning things on the restoring device is that I would have deleted the data already on the first device if I didn't need it anymore. It seems like extra work to temporarily stop backing up something I need just to reduce a restore and then have to re-enable backing those items up. However, if my network speed were severely constrained, I might choose to thin the backups. \n\nA: How restore works on iOS:\niTunes/iCloud extracts the backup onto the device into /var/mobile/Library/SafeHarbor, one directory per app.\nThere it sits, having no effect whatsoever on the device until a corresponding app is installed. Whenever any app is being installed (whether from iTunes or from iCloud/Appstore), installd checks the SafeHarbor directory for restore data, and if present, it moves the restore data into the app's data directories, ready for use.\nAs I understand it, SafeHarbour data eventually gets deleted if the device needs the space and the app has never been installed.\nSo as to your question, the best way to restore the data for just the apps you use is to restore the device as normal, then only install those apps you use (for instance by setting iTunes to sync apps manually, or by installing one-by-one from the App Store). The data for the apps you no-longer use will stay out-of-the-way in the SafeHarbor, and eventually get deleted.\n\nA: Yes, you can restore individual app data if you have an old backup on your computer but it is a tedious and intrusive process so follow carefully step by step:\nStep 1 - You should have an old backup on your computer which has the app data you want to retrieve.\nStep 2 - Delete the particular app(s) from your iPhone\nStep 3 - Do a complete backup of your current iPhone data, apps and everything\nStep 4 - Reset iPhone to factory setting. \nStep 5 - Restore to your old backup which has the particular app data \nStep 6 - Turn on iCloud backup and back up the particular app(s) alone by going to manage section and checking the relevant app(s)\nStep 7 - Reset iPhone to factory settings again\nStep 8 - During initialisation make sure you choose to restore form iCloud backup when you are asked to sign in during the iPhone setup\nStep 9 - After restoring, go to the Appstore and download the corresponding app(s). Now you ll be happy to see the old data back in the app(s) \nStep 10 - Now restore your iPhone to the latest backup you just made which is as per Step 3. This will not erase or replace the apps you installed and restored via iCloud. It will only merge.\nNow you have retrieved the data of the particular app you wanted without modifying anything else on your iPhone. \nOR, if you have a backup in iCloud, make sure you turn off automatic backups before it updates the data and you should do a complete backup on your computer just to be safe, then erase the iPhone completely. Now during setup restore from iCloud and then download the app, you are done. Now you can copy and export the data.\nWARNING : Do not delete the app if its data are in the iCloud. Deleting the app, will also delete the app data and its preferences. \nCheers :)  \n", "Q: Which iPhoto folders are least useful to save space? I'm cleaning up my iPhoto folders since I am short on HD space. Looking inside iPhoto, I see four folders that consume a lot of space: Masters, Modified, Originals, Previews. Which of these are must keep and which can be deleted or recreated?\nFor example, I did do some editing but I would rather have the original since I can reproduce it. \nPS: I do use an app called PhotoSweeper to help me clean up my iPhoto library. I used it to remove duplications and photos that look alike.\n\nA: Before any of these, I would check your iPhoto's trashcan. Most people don't realize that the iPhoto trashcan is completely separate from the systemwide trashcan. Depending on how many photos you take, this can sometimes amounts to GB of space quite easily. I would otherwise leave those individual folders alone, as iPhoto uses those to generate the pictures that are in your iPhoto library. Depending on which folder you target (such as originals), you may end up with a bunch of question marks in your iPhoto library where images used to be. The best way to get rid of pictures is to manage them from within the iPhoto application itself.\n\nA: I use a commercial app called CleanMyMac 2 which can scan your iPhoto libraries and safely remove many gigabytes of files that you don't need. It does this by, among other things, looking for pictures that you have cropped, and identifying the uncropped originals and asking you if you want to delete them.\nFrom their web page:\n\nFind what you can’t see\nYour iPhoto library is a lot larger than you\nthink it is. Every time a photo is cropped, rotated or changed, its\nmodified file is stored in the iPhoto library, while the original is\nkept hidden. CleanMyMac 2 locates all of those hidden originals.\nAuto or manual cleaning\nYou can let CleanMyMac 2 automatically select\nwhich invisible originals are safe to remove. Or you can manually\nreview each image and remove only those you no longer want. How much\nspace you clear is up to you!\n\nCleanMyMac costs US $40. It can also free up a great deal of space on your hard drive by cleaning up and deleting many other kinds of files besides iPhoto files. You can set it up to run automatically at regular intervals and report to you what files it has found that you can choose to delete.\nUpdate: CleanMyMac 2.1.0 now supports iPhoto 9.5 and Mac OS X 10.9 Mavericks.\n\n\nA: It's really simple. They are all required. All. There is no spare or unused material in the library. Don't change anything in the iPhoto Library Folder via the Finder or any other application. iPhoto depends on the structure as well as the contents of this folder. Moving things, renaming things, deleting them or otherwise making changes will prevent iPhoto from working and could even cause you to damage or lose your photos. \nSo, none of the named folders can be deleted.\nMove the library to an external formatted Mac OS Extended (Journaled).\nI would caution against using iPhoto with the Masters on one volume and the library on another. If the path to the library changes at any time you could find yourself re-connecting with every file in the library, one at a time.\n\nA: Many files can be \"cleaned up\" to recoup space.  Previews is one of them and will be recreated as needed.  A blanket statement of \"Don't delete anything or it will break\" is silly.  Do some simple testing with copies of libraries and try to break it by deleting educated guess directories like thumbnails and such...\n", "Q: How can I change the view options for all subfolders at once? I want to adjust the view options of a folder and all of its subfolders, the end result being that they have identical view options.\nI'm not sure where to start with this. I normally launch View options using Command—J, but the settings I specify do not always carry over to a subfolder.\nA bit of Google revealing some success with people using Automator, but the solutions appear outdated.\nI am using Mountain Lion (10.8.2)\n\n\nA: One option is to use the Set Folder Views action in Automator:\n\nThere's no way to change the size or position of windows though.\nYou could also use a script like this, but it's just as slow Automator when applying window properties is checked.\ntell application \"Finder\"\n    folders of entire contents of (POSIX file \"/Users/username/Folder/\" as alias)\n    repeat with f in result\n        open contents of f\n        tell Finder window 1\n            set toolbar visible to false\n            set sidebar width to 0\n            set statusbar visible to false\n            set current view to column view\n            set bounds to {474, 250, 1318, 750}\n            tell its column view options\n                set shows icon to false\n            end tell\n            close\n        end tell\n    end repeat\nend tell\n\nUse as Defaults applies to all normal folders, but folders that have been opened before have .DS_Store files which can override some of the defaults. You could also delete the .DS_Store files:\nfind ~/Folder -name .DS_Store -delete\nosascript -e 'quit app \"Finder\"'\n\nIt also removes Spotlight comments. Once you change some view options or the sorting modes, they are saved to a .DS_Store file which overrides the defaults again.\n", "Q: Run app as admin in Mountain Lion I have an app which has to be run as an admin on Mountain Lion. This app is NOT installed on the system. The user Does NOT want to open the terminal and run sudo /xyzlocation/Myapp. \nThe idea is the user will click on the App. The App launches and then the App opens terminal where the user can key in the password.The App will then continue running. The user is the admin on the system. \nAlso not sure if it makes a difference but XQuartz or X11 is not present on the user's machine. \n\nA: What if you wrote a script with the sudo that they could double-click? You could also modify the sudoers file to not need the password.\nAppleScript could do this too, including a standard OSX popup for the password.\n", "Q: Best way to back up old CD-ROMS? I'm trying to backup all of my old backup CDs from over 10 years ago to simple DMG files on my harddrive - since CD's die (already have one that won't read) and they take up a ton of physical space!\nI've picked DMG files since they're 1) simple/easy and 2) compressed. Certainly open to other suggestions however.\nAfter creating a few of the images, I've noticed that not all of the content from one of the CDs is in the image that Disk Utility is producing - only one of the folders is present when there should be 4. I can't figure it out, but my best guess is that it was a multisession/track CD. But the CD doesn't appear as unique in DiskUtility or in the Finder.\nAny ideas what could be the cause? Or is there a better way to do what I'm trying to do?\n\nA: Personally I'd forget the dmg format, buy a decent sized usb drive and retrieve as much as you can by just dragging and dropping from any CDs you can mount. Time enough when you have retrieved all your data to wonder about how to compress it. Even if a CD is full it can only store 700mb so it would take a load of CDs to fill a terabyte drive. Then, when you have all your data saved, make another copy and store that offsite somewhere as a backup.\n\nA: OS/2 would allow you to leave a cd/dvd open (unfinished) for later filling, finishing and final-burning. MacOS hates these open discs and I've been unable to retrieve much data from those few that I had forgotten to 'finish'. \n", "Q: My internal hard disk is 0 byte and a flashing question mark I have been striving to bring my laptop to life,\nhowever, I am seeing a flashing question mark on my MacbookPro screen. \nI tried disk utility and it is just showing me Media and it is 0 byte. \nI ran DiskWarrior and it gave following error:\nAn unexpected error occurred while communicating with this hard drives built in S.M.A.R.T. diagnostics, error -536870210, 28260C-\n\nA: I installed a new hard disk.

These photos were synced to the iPad from iPhoto on my iMac. \nHow can I transfer them back to my iMac since they are not in the camera roll on my iPad?\n\nA: iExplorer is an app that does the trick. I just tested it, and it works.\nSo it's quite simple and straightforward. Launch the app, and select you iPad from the sources, there will be a Photos section, and everything should be there.\nThe same thing happened to me once, but I used Time Machine to backup.

Is there a way for Cmd+Tab to display all of the instances/windows of an app?\nAn excellent example is here: \nNotice how it shows the available instances of that application? That's what I'm looking for.\n\nA: If you don't care about seeing the window thumbnails, ⌘ - ` (the key above the Tab key) switches between open instances of an app.\n\nA: Witch does exactly that, with a ton of configuration options. It can also use the default Cmd - Tab shortcut.\n", "Q: Why can't I open downloads from Google Chrome's download bar? For some reason, clicking on downloads in the Google Chrome download bar does nothing any more; I'm pretty sure it did until some time recently, but it's been a while since it did.\nAlso, choosing \"Show in Finder\" doesn't work. So, it seems that Chrome in general can't open anything in the Finder.\nIf anyone knows what is causing that, I'd love to know it, or alternately, how I could go about troubleshooting it myself.\nEdit in response to comments:\n\n\n*\n\n*I've tried re-downloading it, although not running it from another directory; I'll try that at home.\n\n*I'll give it a shot.\n\n*No, the downloads list is no more functional than the download bar with respect to Finder integration.\n\n\nA: It's caused by a bug in 10.8.2. Occasionally revealing files in Finder stops working in all applications, and for example Archive Utility stops responding when extracting archives.\nAs a workaround, you can terminate appleventsd from Activity Monitor or with sudo killall -kill appleeventsd (without -kill the process is sent a TERM signal, which makes other processes stop responding). The issue will probably return within a few hours or days though.\n", "Q: Get iPad serial number on iCloud My girlfriend and I have traveled to Singapore and her iPad has gotten stolen.\nWe can't seem to find her iPad serial number anywhere (she never plugged it into her computers as it was backed up through iCloud and it charged faster through the socket), and she's binned the box it came in from.\nApple's support website doesn't show it under her Apple ID either. We've also tried going through other possible emails, but there's only the one.\nIt does, however, show under Find my iPhone on the iCloud website. Is there a way to retrieve the serial number through here?\nWe need it so that the police here can match it to a database of lost and found devices.\n\nA: I've found how you do it.\nWith Xcode installed, open your terminal and run:\nopen ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.iPod.plist\nThis will open the property list editor.\nNavigate down to Root -> Devices and look under each device to recognise the one you're looking for.

In my movie folder I have loads of movies. The ones I watched I want to mark as watched. \nI suppose I could either use the colors (like green for watched) or the Spotlight tags, but I would rather have a checkbox of sorts which I could tick.\nThe colors and the tags I don't find all that useable. Also, I do not want to add the files to iTunes. \nIs there something like this? \n\nA: Simply put, No. Finder is for file management, therefore such feature will be weird. You might be able to find plugins for this, but I doubt it. Most people use iTunes to achieve such job, which you seems to be reluctant to do.\nYou can try making a separate iTunes library for these files, and not importing them to your new library. That might help.\n\nA: One option might be to rely on the date last opened metadata.\nIn the case of torrents you want to keep seeding, you could hide the files or folders. Copy them, open Terminal, type chflags hidden , and press ⌘V.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro battery charging stops early I have a Mac Book Pro 15\" over a year now. I'm having a problem with charging the battery.\nDuring work it stops charging and goes to battery powered mode. If I switch to a different power source it lights up only for a second.\nI tried solving the problem by getting a new charger but it didn't help. Did you happen to hear about a similar problem? Is there a solution?\n\nA: The first thing I will look for is dirt in the MagSafe port, there might be something there, but the chances are small.\nThe second thing I will do is a reset on SMC and PRAM, and any of the hardware stuff. I am not sure if PRAM is related, but hey, we want to rule out any possibility.\nYou can find how to reset PRAM here, SMC here. (SMC is a more likely problem, do that first)\nThe third thing I would do is a clean install, but no need to tell you, backup first. Whether a data backup or a Time Machine backup, but data backup will be cleaner.\nHere comes the last thing we could do, open it up. Nay, just kidding, send it to Apple, have them figure it out. If it's not out of warranty for long, you could get a free repair, it's about chances.\n", "Q: Is USB 3.0 overkill for Time Machine hard drive? I have two 500 Gb hard drives.  One is USB 2.0, the other is USB 3.0.  My intention is to use one of these hard drives for Time Machine, and the other for storing media files on (mp3s, mp4s mostly).\nWould it be a waste of the USB 3.0 speeds to put Time Machine on that drive, or will I benefit.\n\nA: It depends. I assume your Mac does has USB 3.0 support since you asked the question.\nTime Machine target does not need to be very fast, since Time Machine only backup all your files for the first time, it's just delta (changes) it backups after that. So if you delete a file, and create a new file, it backup just those two changes.\nBut of course the faster the drive, the faster the initial backup.\nMedia drive don't have to be fast. Even a 1080p video won't exceed like 2MBps, and most USB 2.0 drive can easily go up to 20 ~ 30 MBps (real world)\nIt's your choice. Again, you need to copy all the files to your external drive, and it takes time.\nIf they're enclosure, then problem solved. The initial backup and media copy can all be done with the USB 3.0 enclosure, and then just choose which goes to which based on your mood.\nMy personal experience:\nUSB 2.0 3.5\" 28 MBps\nUSB 3.0 2.5\" 55 MBps\nUSB 3.0 3.5\" 110 MBps\nAll enclosures, I built them myself!\n\nA: The only time you will be waiting for Time Machine is when you restore a huge amount of data in case of an accidental erasure or a full system restore.\nUnless you have other resource issues or problems, Time Machine should be a background process and never slow the operation, so most people put their slowest drive on backup duty. Furthermore, the nature of Time Machine where only changed files get written, you have huge data compression and a fraction of the data gets written each incremental backup.\nUnless your other use of the drive is even lower priority than the initial backup, the eventual restore - you would want to keep the faster drive for things you need to wait for a copy or a use and let the system wait for the slower drive when it's running normal backups in the background.\n\nA: If you have fast HDs (Eg, Wester Digital Caviar Black doing 155MB/s 1\n, or almost any SSD) then you may be limited by the USB 2.0 rates.\n", "Q: TimeMachine restore issue Times ago I did a \"restore from time machine backup\" in order to restore all my files on a new SSD I bought for my macbookpro (with OSX Lion), and all went fine.\nToday I installed Mountain Lion on that mac, did a new timemachine backup, then used that backup in order to configure my new retina display macbook pro… initially seemed all ok this time too… but several files were not be backedup properly and I get \"corrupted settings\"… for example if I use git and svn commands in the terminal it says \"no command found\" althought under /usr/local/ I have them installed!\nWhat happened? The thing which scares me the more is that in previous backup the files I was working on were backedup with older version (2012)… What should I do?\n\nA: It sounds like your $PATH is not set correctly. All you probably need to do is set your $PATH in your shell config (.profile, .bashrc, .zshrc, etc… for whatever shell you are using).\nFor bash derived shells you can use:\nexport PATH=\"$PATH:/usr/local\"\nAre you sure the git binary is in /usr/local? One of my machines shows the git binary is in /usr/local/git/bin and on the other it is in /usr/bin.\nI've got different paths for git on different machines, so maybe the new install of git put it in a different place than the old machine.\n", "Q: Can iOS be extended Language and spell correction on iPad 3 I would like to know if there is a Bosnian spelling checker for my iPad and iPhone.  I'm kind of wondering because there are more Bosnian speakers than there are Slovenian and Montenegrin combined, but currently Apple only has Slovenian listed as a language.\n\nA: A search in the AppStore suggests there is no app that specializes in Bosnian spelling and grammar. Due to the nature of iOS, you can't plug in new languages unless you first jailbreak the device and then find a program that does what you ask.\nAs Gerry stated above in the comments, you can request this feature from Apple at http://apple.com/feedback \n", "Q: How to show a notification when the iSIght webcam turns on? Is it possible to get a desktop notification when my iSight turns on? It would be optimal if this could go through Growl, but I've tried HardwareGrowler and it doesn't give me a notification.\nI know that the green light always turns on when the iSight turns on, but when the iSight turns on just for one second it is possible that I'm not looking at the screen and that I miss the green light, hence a notification that stays on the screen until I close it would be optimal.\nI'm on a MacBook Pro 5,3 and I have Mountain Lion 10.8.3.\n\nA: With the help of Growl's documentation about AppleScript support and a little discussion with Bart Arondson and Elliot B in the comments onto the question I've come up with the following AppleScript.\nI've saved this script as an application agent which you can add to your login items in System Preferences → Users & Groups → Login Items.\nBasically, this application works by detecting if a unique executable related to using the camera is being accessed.

Instead, it showed only a one-color screen and wouldn't wake up. So I closed and opened the lid a couple of times (it worked before), hoping that it will wake up. When it didn't, I decided to power it down from the power button.\nThen, when I turned it on, it wouldn't boot at all.\nAfter the initial infarct thoughts of dead SSD, playing with all possible boot modes and stuff, in safe mode it showed that it is indefinitely waiting for a boot device.\nSo I switched the drives, the SSD went in to the caddy and the HDD went into the primary slot, an VOILA - it worked again! The good thing was that the SSD is alive (the last Time Machine backup was 1 month old, which was bad).\nWhen I booted in restore mode I tried to unlock the encrypted SSD in order to repair it and its permissions, but could not. Did a search and found out that it should be because of problematic encryption.\nThen, I decrypted the SSD successfully from within OSX, and tried to switch the drives back to the original configuration - the SSD in the primary and the HDD in the secondary slot.\nTo my big surprise, it does not work! There is some problem having the SSD in the primary slot.\nThe laptop is out of warranty, I need it badly and I live in a country with very expensive services, so I am trying to find out the problem without leaving it in the repair shop for days or weeks.\nSo, any thoughts on what could the problem be?\n\nA: Is it definitely the Late-2011 model and not the early-2011 model? as the early-2011 model had an intermittent problem with interference on the hard drive flex cable. It would usually only cause problems when a 6G SSD is fitted. Because it is the boot drive you can find the interference can cause boot problems, sometimes locking up or beach balling (the coloured circle going around).\nIf this is the case, the Late-2011 hard drive flex cable resolved this problem, so a replacement cable should sort it... but if its not working in the optical caddy either, then something else is going on (unless you have the 2.3GHz i5 Early-2011 machine. in which case, thats the only 2011 machine with a 3G SATA port in the optical bay, so your 6G drive wouldn't work in it). Can you confirm the generation? or the serial number will help identify the exact range and processor speed.\nyou can sometime fix the interference problem by insulating the flex cable a bit... or for testing the machine, connect your SSD to the hard drive flex cable, but instead of fitting it to the machine, leave the drive sitting on the side out of the casing unit so its away from the cable itself, as it will eliminate most of the direct interference issues. \nI hope this helps. if you check your machine generation just let me know and i will see if i can help any further\n", "Q: Can't assign keyboard shortcut to service In OSX 10.8.2, I created a service using Automator and saved it in ~/Library/Services.

I'm using a grid-computing software to donate my CPU time, so every core is always 100 Celsius degrees (212F), all day.\nIs there a reference, from Apple or other source, indicating a safe temperature for this notebook?\n\nA: According to the intel, spec-sheet, Page 20, the maximum allowed temperature of all the new i3,i5,i7 cpus is 105 Celsius degrees so you are approaching the limit. However all cpus are designed in a way that they will send a signal to the motherboard in case the cpu is overheating to either shut-down the pc completely or dramatically reduce the performance (by lowering the clock-speed). \nStudying Anandtech's review of the latest MacBook Retina it's clearly visible that the Macbook pro retina automatically reduces the performance in case of really high temperature over a longer period of time. According to them while running various benchmarks in Half-Life 2 the performance of the retina model dropped by about 5% compared to the old model which dropped by about 20%). \nI think you don't need to worry to much about the temperature. If the cpu is reaching its thermal limit it will automatically try to do something about it. You may even think about investing in a cooling pad as the enclosure of the mac is made out of aluminium, it acts a a massive heat-sink and theoretically you could lower the temperature by  using a cool-pad for laptops and fit it underneath.\n\n", "Q: Are the iLife install discs still compatible with Mountain Lion? I'm about to install Mountain Lion to my Macbook Pro. But before I go for an upgrade, I've search some information about the Mountain Lion. Some says that their iLife was removed after upgrading. I'm using iLife 11 on Mac OSX Snow Leopard, and I still have the Application discs. \nAre the iLife install discs still compatible with Mountain Lion?\n\nA: Your version of iLife is fully compatible with Mountain Lion. It is actually the current version that ships with Mountain lion. There is no reason that installing Mountain lion should overwrite or otherwise remove your version of iLife. A standard installation should always preserve all of your applications and user settings.\n\nA: The short answer, as given by soxman, is yes: the iLife apps will work, and even the DVD edition can be updated to the latest version.\nHowever, the signing certificate used on some versions -- definitely on the MBP 2011 OEM disc -- has expired, resulting in a warning or immediate installation failure.\nIn the latter case, a selective package installer such as the nag-screen shareware Pacifist will easily work around the issue.\n", "Q: Why do I have to restore the iTunes Library folder permissions every time I update iTunes?

I have tried both the \"Shared Profile\" and adding shared folders manually. As I understand it, they should show up under Network in Windows Explorer, right? Well, the only thing showing up there is MyName-WIN7 which contains a Users folder, which in turn contains a folder with my name and a folder called Public. The contents of the folder with my name is the same as in C:\\Users\\MyName and has nothing to do with anything on the Mac. I have Googled until my eyes turned red for a solution, but everyone just says the same thing - Go to Configure > Sharing, etc. Well I have tried all of that, there must be some setting that's prohibiting my shared Mac folders from showing up in Windows...

Should I take it back? I bought a retina macbook pro yesterday and noticed a \"Service battery\" warning. It was there for a few hours and now has gone. Should I take it back to the store or do you think it's safe to ignore?\nUpdate: The following day, the laptop battery was completely drained after being 100% the night before (and fully powered down). The \"Service battery\" warning also re-appeared. I took it back and it was just swapped it for a new one.\n\nA: I have a 4 year old Macbook and it occasionally shows the \"Service Battery\" warning. It doesn't appear all the time. It certainly isn't normal to have that show up so soon. I would take it back especially since you are very much within the 14 day return period. Even if they don't want to fix it, you could exchange it.\nIt sounds like you simply have a defective battery. Retina Macbook Pro's do not have user-serviceable batteries, which makes it even more imperative to get it fixed while you can.\nCourse, if you have AppleCare+, and were willing to wait and see if the battery life is less-then-desirable, you could wait.

I was trying to add something to $PATH and it went totally wrong.  I now can't run any commands such as ls.  I've looked at this answer  and used the following lines:\nPATH=/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/X11/bin\nPATH=$PATH:~/bin\n\nThese lines fix the problem temorarily; however, when I restart terminal it seems to forget these changes.\nHow do I permanently reset my $PATH?\nI'm running the most recent version of Mountain Lion. \n\nA: Remove the your bash profile to restore the default $PATH. Enter the following command into Terminal.app:\n/bin/rm ~/.bash_profile\n\nThe change will take place with the next shell or terminal session.\n\nA: OSX's default $PATH is generated from the contents of the /etc/paths file, it's fairly straight-forward to modify.\n\nA: The suggested answer of removing .bash_profile is not a good idea in general. There are other things that can be set in that file besides PATH definitions.\nIf you want to undo the effects of your experimentation, just remove or comment out that PATH line with a #.\nYou don't want to edit the PATH from scratch, but append to it, as you did with your second line. The preferred method of adding something to your path would be:\nexport PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin\n\nEDIT\nSince your PATH is messed up, you don't have access to the usual commands to make these changes. As a temporary fix, you can define a new minimal path in a Terminal window (not in your .bash_profile) by typing:\nPATH=/bin:/usr/bin\n\nThis will temporarily give you access to nano ls mv vi cat and rm -- the basic tools to check and edit your .bash_profile and fix your problem...\nRepeat, do not put this PATH definition anywhere except for the duration of the session while you make your fixes.\n\nA: I recommend:\nsource /etc/profile\n\nThis is what Mac uses to set the initial path, and it will put everything back in place excepting the items that you are adding for your user.\nI do a decent amount of path modification in my ~/.bash_profile, and I've placed this at the top of the file because I was having issues with reloading my profile while I'm working after I tweak an alias in there or something, and it was adding duplicate references to my path. Instead of checking to see if it's already added, I just reset my path to the scratch version and re-append the items I want.\nUPDATE: When switching to zsh, I changed my .bash_profile to .zshrc and then changed my reload profile alias to source the /etc/zprofile, which resets the path to scratch as described earlier for bash. Here's the alias I have defined so that I can quickly reload my profile:\nalias reloadprofile='source /etc/zprofile && source ~/.zshrc'\n\nI believe you can accomplish the same thing by calling exec zsh, which replaces the current instance with a new one and reloads the .zshrc file, but I haven't experimented enough with it to be completely sure.\n\nA: These methods are great! If you have this problem with zsh, remove ~/.zshrc This will get rid of your zsh settings though.\n", "Q: osx - opening a unicode file in text edit I'd like to process a unicode text file using TextEdit.

I currently bought a Mac and I'm a noob :). I used to connect to my server using stunnel on Windows and Ubuntu. I'm also a noob in networking.\nI check website download section, and there's no Mac version, but in users-community mailing list I see some posts about running it under macOS. But they didn't help to figure out what should I do.\nSo anyone can help me install stunnel on OS X Mountain Lion (10.8.2), or tell me is there any alternative app?\n\nA: What you like to do ... there is a working SSH / SSL already on your Mac. If you like to build stunnel you need Xcode with the CLI tools ... and some time. I haven´t tried it but a quick look in the build instructions looks as if there are no big problems. \n\nAs promised, here are the steps to build stunnel from source. I used a Lion machine but it is the same on a Mountain Lion machine. There is no need for Fink, MacPorts or Homebrew ... brings more troubles then it helps.\nGo to https://www.stunnel.org/downloads.html and download stunnel-5.23.tar.gz and stunnel-5.23.tar.gz.sha256. Open a terminal  Utilities => Terminal>. Terminal is case sensitive, before you do something think twice before you press return - there is no undo or redo in terminal. Each line is one line in terminal and needs to press return at the end of the line.\ncd $HOME/Downloads\nopenssl dgst -sha256 stunnel-5.23.tar.gz\nmore stunnel-5.23.tar.gz.sha256\n\nCompare the output of the last 2 lines - if it matches all is fine, if not you had a security problem during download.\ntar -xzvf stunnel-5.23.tar.gz\ncd stunnel-5.23\n./configure && make && make check && sudo make install\n\nThe configure script uses autoconf, so put your fingers away from other options because if all is there and supported it will build a fine 64 bit app for you. make check is optionally. sudo make install requires your admin password. During this step you had to input some basic informations (self explaining). The && is used to run one command after each other ONLY if the last was successful.\nAfter all is done your stunned app was installed in /usr/local/bin. To run it, open terminal and type stunnel or stunnel3 (see the docs for the difference) and press return. \nFor the config file type in terminal.\ncd /usr/local/etc/stunnel\nsudo cp stunnel.conf-sample stunnel.conf\nsudo pico stunnel.conf\n\nFor the documentation of pico use in terminal.\nman pico\n\nIf I had some mistypes of filenames or anything else here use in terminal the following command to list a directory\nls -la\n\nFor the rest, have fun with stunned and the documentation of it !\n\nA: To install many UNIX, GNU, and other open source tools including stunnel I recommend to use the MacPorts package management system in addition of the XCode command line tools. MacPorts will keep these softwares easy to manage. Additionally, some of the softwares have special MacPorts' build which work nicer with OS X system.\nWith MacPorts installed, you can install stunnel using this command on the shell:\nport install stunnel\n\n\nA: This can be installed using homebrew:\nbrew install stunnel\n\n", "Q: How to move not copy files into iTunes I have a folder containing all my Music, Movies etc. This contains various formats of music file, including some that iTunes cannot play (i.e. flac and oggs) but a lot of mp3s.\nI'd like to have iTunes import all the formats it can play, moving those files into the iTunes Media folder, but leaving behind the files in formats it isn't able to play.  That way I can decide what to do with those files later, but the rest of my media is managed through iTunes.\nThe option in iTunes preferences copies files into the iTunes Media folder, but leaves behind a duplicate.\nAm I missing something, or is there a trick to this?\n\nA: iTunes never deletes original files. But you could use a simple script to remove the mp3/aac files (which are supported by iTunes). \nBut if you uncheck \"Keep iTunes Media folder organized\", files will be read from their original location without being copied; \n\nA: I would import all with iTunes and let it make copies. In the Finder, Arrange the folder by Kind and Sort by Kind as well. Then it should be easy to pick out the files you know iTunes did import and delete them with one selection. Assuming you have OSX 10.8.\n\nA: In the end I let iTunes copy all the media.  Then I could search for all files that contained .mp3 in the source folder, and move them to trash.\n", "Q: How to set two-sided printing as default in Mountain Lion Preview? Every time I print from Preview app I need to manually click on \"Two-sided\" checkbox. This is annoying when I have a bunch of documents to print. Is there any way to set \"two-sided\" as default?\n\nA: In the print dialog you should save a new preset. Below you can find the steps to do so.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the Print dialog. It will look something like this:\n\n\n*Check the Two-Sided box.\n\n\n*Go to the Presets drop down list and click Save As...\n\n\n*Type a name for the preset in the dialog and choose if you want this preset available for all your installed printers or just this one.\n\n\n*Now choose that preset in the dropdown list.

I had my comments in Microsoft Word showing up on the right had pane as usual, but I must have done something to make it disappear. I can't figure out how to make it visible again. When I attempt to add a new comment, all the old comments show up on the left side of the pane, but no longer linked. Instead I have this bracketed indicator [12], in with the comment number inserted. When i click on it, it jumps to the comment.\nWhat so I have to change to have comments show up on the right side again?\n\nA: Right now, you are seeing comments in the sidebar because of a change that you made at some point in \"Preferences.\" This should be what you are currently seeing:\n\nWhat you are hoping to get back to, if I understand correctly, is this:\n\nTo make this change, go to the menu bar at the top of the screen and click on \"Word\" which will invoke a drop down menu. From the menu, select \"Preferences...\" Once the preferences window opens, select \"Track Changes.\" When the Track Changes pane opens, make sure to check the radio box at the bottom that reads \"Use balloons to display changes\" (see screenshot below). This will make the change you're looking for. \n\n\nA: This previous answer is likely incorrect and didn't help the person. There is a bug in Mac Word 2011 that switches the View from Print Layout to Draft, which automatically removes the balloons and puts them in the pane with numbers in the text. It happens almost invariably when I complete a spell check, especially when it's a docx file. Usually I can simply go to the View tab and switch it back to Print Layout. However, it has suddenly happened on other occasions as well, always when working in the docx format. In these cases I usually have to transfer the document to a PC to fix the problem. The problem seems, at least in part, to be related to the docx versus doc format, because the fix for it is save the docx file as a doc, open it on a PC, then resave it as a docx on the PC. When you take it back to the Mac, it should be in the correct format. Obviously this fix is a problem for those who don't have both Mac and PC versions of Word in their households. I know that spell checking (which has other bugs that cause Word to crash) will trigger the bug, but I haven't isolated what the other triggers are.\n\nA: I just quit Word and re-launched it, voilà! Green comment boxes now back in the right-hand margin. Do make sure that the Balloons showing is on.\n\nA: I had the same issue here is how I fixed it.  \n\n\n*\n\n*Open your current .doc file you want to track changes in and save it as a .docx file. \n\n*Open the new .docx file and click on the Review tab, click On for Track Changes, then click on Show Markup, then click on Preferences located at the bottom of the drop down. Under the Balloons section click on both boxes then click OK at the bottom.\n\n*Delete any word and you will see the track changes balloon feature working now. \n\n", "Q: SSD OEM Exact Model, Part Number and Manufacturer in MacBook Pro (Mid 2012) Does anyone know the exact manufacturer, Apple part number or model number of a 512GB SSD drive in a BTO MacBook Pro (Mid 2012)? \nI cannot find any teardown photos or System Information screenshots online.

I have an iPad on which I can access my email through a mobile mail server. It all works fine. But when trying to access my mail through my mac there is a security problem of some sort that won't allow me to access my email. So I was thinking, since I can avoid this security problem on my iPad, is there a way for me to access the same server as I do on my iPad? Maybe not in Mail.app but perhaps Sparrow or equivalent?\nCheers for the help!\n\nA: Via The Browser\nYou'd have to send a mobile user agent to the mobile.company.com (there's a redirect on desktop devices). Safari will get you there via User Agent in the developer tools. First turn on Developer Tools.\n\nThen change the user agent.\n\nNow you should be able to access mobile mail server as a mobile user: mobile.company.com. I'm not sure if your ISP provides a webmail interface for mobile users. If not, you won't see much there.\nPotential Solution: Spoof User Agent in Desktop Email Client\nI can't quickly find an email client which directly spoofs user agent. If I had to guess which ones might be capable of offering an alternative user agent, you could try either MailMate (powerful high configurable shareware) or Thunderbird (geeky open source with an option for everything).\nContact info to MailMate creator Benny Kjær Nielsen is here.\nAlternative Solution: Clean Up Your Mac's Certification Authorities\nYou may find it easier to reset your security certificates. Make sure Keychain Access is set up this way.\n\nYou should also delete expired or invalid certificates from under the System sidebar menu. Once you've done both of these things, you should run Software Update as Apple should replace some of the now missing certificates. Certificates and Signing Authorities can be imported by hand but that's beyond the scope of this answer.\nI've just done this myself and it's allowed Chromium to load Github again. It may work with your email security issues as well. This is the lasting and flexible solution but perhaps the hardest to pin down.\n", "Q: Download Mountain Lion on unsupported Mac?

But if you try to watch a movie on the ipad it changes to all different colors. I've been told that its either stuck or dead pixels. If that is the case, is there a fix for this? Would a new digitizer help at all? \n\nA: Since that would be almost 200,000 pixels, I do not think they are dead or stuck, at least not in the traditional sense. I'd say there is something else that's broken.\n", "Q: Block device from accessing the Internet, but not Wi-Fi I have an Apple Airport and I would like to find out how to configure devices that can access the home network but be blocked from accessing the Internet.  \nI know how to block a device from accessing Wi-Fi completely, but all I want is to limit a device from accessing the Internet. I still want the device to be able to connect to other computers, the file server, the printer, etc. on the local network.\nI am hoping for a router-based solution, such as discussed here.\nIs this possible with Airport?\n\nA: To prevent a device from accessing the internet, but allowing it to access files on a local network over Wi-Fi you can setup an ad hoc network.\nThe ad hoc network will be hosted by your Mac and devices, like your Eye-Fi card* or your kids laptop, can connect to it and access shared local folders.\n\n\n*\n\n*Turn Airport On\n\n\n\n*Click on Create a Network. The following screen will appear:\n\n\n*If you want password protection, check Require Password and type a desired password.\n\n\n*Hit Ok. Now you're Mac is broadcasting a network.\nThe Eye-Fi support page explains how to connect to an ad hoc network.\n\n\n*\n\n*Note on the Eye-Fi card: according to this website only the Eye-Fi Pro and Eye-Fi Pro X2 can connect to an ad hoc network.\n\n\nGeneral note: if you want other devices to access files and folders on your Mac those files and folders have to be shared. How to do that is suitable for another question.\n", "Q: Application similar to MS Paint to do graphical work on Mac This is going to sound silly to someone who does this everyday.. but I am confused about something.\nWhat do people use to do similar things like with MS Paint (not Paint.net), e.g. stuff like making rage comics and meme's or other such silly things. The only graphics application I found for my Mac is GIMP\n\nA: Probably the most similar to MS Paint that I've seen is Paintbrush.\n\n", "Q: Is swipe to archive possible with non-Gmail account in iOS? Is it possible to configure which folder to put mail in when swiping on a email to archive/delete with a non-Gmail account?\nMy objective with this would be to file email into an archive more easily than tapping Edit->Move->ArchiveFolder. This is currently possible when you set up a Gmail account on your device but not with other accounts. \n\nA: This can now be accomplished very easily in iOS 7.\n(n.b. The following assumes that you have already setup your account on the iOS device. These steps described are for a generic IMAP account. Also, when ALL CAPS are used below, it is to reflect how Apple has it listed in iOS 7.)\n\n\n*\n\n*Launch the 'Settings' app on your iOS device\n\n*Scroll down and then tap on \"Mail, Contacts, Calendars\"\n\n*Tap on the email account you want to configure.\n\n*Tap on the 'Account' line with the > at the top of the next screen\n\n*On the 'IMAP ACCOUNT INFORMATION' screen, scroll all the way down until you see 'Advanced' and tap on it\n\n*Now you will see a 'MAILBOX BEHAVIORS' screen, showing you which mailboxes are used for Drafts, Sent, Deleted, and Archive mailboxes.\n\n*Important: Tap on the 'Archive Mailbox' line and verify that you have chosen the correct folder on the server where you want messages to be saved.\n\n*Once you have verified that the Archive Mailbox points to where you want it to go, look for the 'MOVE DISCARDED MESSAGES INTO' section, and tap 'Archive Mailbox' (instead of 'Deleted Mailbox')\n\n*Important: These changes will not be saved until you properly exit the configuration screen. To do this, tap the '< Account button near the top of the 'Advanced' screen.\n\n*When you get back to the 'Account' screen, tap 'Done' at the top-right corner.\n\n\nIf you'd like a step-by-step guide with screenshots, I have created one and made it available at: http://share.luo.ma/TUAW/guides/Archive-Email-Instead-of-Deleting.pdf\n\nA: I have been looking for an answer to that for some time now. So far the only suggestion I was told was to try Sparrow for iOS, which does just that\n\nA: First change the location of deleted items for the non-Gmail account, under Settings > Mail > Account > Advanced. Afterwards, when you swipe and Delete, the \"deleted\" messages should go to your selected folder.\n"]
