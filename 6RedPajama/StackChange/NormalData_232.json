I develop using Python on Ubuntu and so I use the workon command (from virtualenvwrapper) a lot to switch virtualenvs.\nPreviously, workon was the first tab-completion match for \"wo\", so I could type w,o,tab to match it.

Why doesn't Xfce's Thunar do this?\n\n\nA: *\n\n*The screenshot shows a Thunar dialog.  Thunar is one of the most versatile and customizable file managers on Linux.  If you want to add items in the context menu, use Edit/Configure custom actions.  There are several posts on doing this, all over the internet.

You should open Thunar itself and right-click on the desired file or folder and select the proper action.\n", "Q: Cannot boot Failed to open \\efi\\boot\\grubx64.efi - not found So I removed and then reinstalled my power supply a few months back on my home server and for some reason it stopped booting to ubuntu and working like it always has been.\nI've tried completely reinstalling ubuntu, install on a new hard drive, and most recently boot-repair. Still nothing. Honestly I'm still a novice and learning so some help would be appreciated.\nThe paste from the boot-repair:\nhttp://paste.ubuntu.com/16581526/\nI get a quick message on boot before seeing a flashing underscore and holding shift on boot doesn't bring up any grub options. The message reads:\nFailed to set MokListRT: Invalid Parameter\nFailed to open \\EFI\\BOOT\\grubx64.efi - Not Found\nFailed to load image \\EFI\\BOOT\\grubx64.efi - Not Found\nFailed to open \\EFI\\BOOT\\MokManager.efi - Not Found\nFailed to load image \\EFI\\BOOT\\MokManager.efi - Not Found\n\nPlease help this noob :D\n\nA: Some key things I've noticed about your output:\n\n\n*\n\n*You have two EFI System Partitions (ESPs), /dev/sda1 and /dev/sdb1. This is legal, but makes it harder to troubleshoot the computer.\n\n*Your /dev/sda1 ESP seems to be empty -- or at least, Boot Info Script has not identified any boot files on it. This could be a bug in Boot Info Script (it misses things sometimes), or it could be it was accidentally wiped, has filesystem damage, etc.\n\n*Your /dev/sdb1 seems to have files that normally reside on a Linux root (/) filesystem and seems to be missing the usual ESP files. This makes me think you accidentally copied those files or something went badly wrong when specifying mount points in the installation process.\n\n*Your main Ubuntu installation seems to be on /dev/sdb2. This is fine; I'm just pointing it out in case you believed it was somewhere else.\n\n*Some of your GRUB entries seem to point to an installation on /dev/sda2, but there's no evidence of an Ubuntu installation at that location.\n\n\nThe Failed to... messages you report are from Shim, which is Ubuntu's way of dealing with Secure Boot. They indicate failures to launch various follow-on programs. In your case, they probably indicate a badly broken GRUB installation.\nOverall, it's not clear to me how your system got into its current state. At a minimum, its GRUB installation is badly messed up. At worst, critical system files may be mis-placed or missing, which could be very difficult to track down and repair.\nI recommend the following actions for repair:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you have any critical user files on the computer, back them up.\n\n*Delete all the partitions on both disks.\n\n*Use GParted, parted, gdisk, or some other tool to create new partitions.\n\n\n*\n\n*If you use parted, gdisk, or something else that does not create filesystems, create new filesystems, too. (If you happen to create a new partition with the same start point as the old one, the old filesystem will re-appear, and you do not want that to happen, hence the instruction to create fresh filesystems.)\n\n*Create one ESP on one disk (probably /dev/sda).\n\n*There are many ways to use two disks -- you can set up separate partitions for filesystems like /home or /var, use LVM, etc. Decide ahead of time what to do and set it up appropriately.\n\n\n*Re-install Ubuntu on the freshly-partitioned disks. If you used another program to create partitions, you should use the \"Something Else\" installation/partitioning option and manually specify mount points. See here for the basics of how to use the \"Something Else\" option. (Note that if you install the server version of Ubuntu, the installer is different, so these details will be different, too.)\n\n*If necessary, restore the user data you backed up at the start.\n\n\nThe point of this procedure is to eliminate all the peculiarities with your current setup. It's unclear to me how some of these peculiarities came to be, and they could be signs of even more fundamental problems. Thus, tracking down the true cause(s) and repairing what you've got could be quite time-consuming. Because you mentioned that you've done a fresh install, chances are you won't be throwing away a lot of customizations by doing another re-install, so that's almost certain to be the quicker and easier course of action.\n", "Q: How to install correct drivers for Radeon r9 390x?

This says your card is fully supported.\nYou are using the AMDGPU driver already. If the result of lshw -c video is Radeon you are using AMDGPU.\nThe alternative proprietary driver is fglrx. It will be faster than AMDGPU (at least at the time of writing) so you may want to give it a try. Instructions for installing it are here. It will work under Ubuntu 16.04\nModern versions of Ubuntu don't use /etc/X11/xorg.conf so editing it will not effect anything.\nIf you are connecting to your monitor using a single link DVI cable, this will limit your resolution. A single link is only capable of supporting resolutions up to 1920 X 1200 at 60Hz. Buy a dual link DVI cable which supports resolutions up to 2560 X 1600 at 60Hz.\nVersions of HDMI up to 1.3 are equivalent to a single link DVI cable so cant support the resolution you are trying to achieve.\nOne solution is to upgrade to a monitor with more than one DVI input or buy a 2 port DVI switch (and make sure it supports dual link DVI). An example of a simple switch that definitely supports dual link is the HQ 2 port DVI_I switch.

If so, how?\nIf you can shed any light, it would be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: You may try Thunderbird. The newest version should include Lightning calendar and Provider for Google Calendar (if not you can search for these addons & install). Thunderbird gives this kind of persistent alert on a new event:\n\nOnce you have Thunderbird with Lightning and Provider for Google Calendar you may do the following:\nSync your Google account:\nGo to File > New > Calendar, then select On the Network, then Google Calendar and log in and grant permission.\nInstall Firetray:\nGo to Tools > Add-ons and search for Firetray and install it. This will keep Thunderbird running minimised in notification area, so you won't have to keep thunderbird open to get alerts for new events.\nChange Notification Sound:\nGo to Edit > Preferences > Calendar > Reminders (tab), make sure the checkbox next to Play a Sound is marked and then click on Browse to select the sound you want as alert.\nIn addition you might also want to start Thunderbird at system start-up so that you don't need to manually start it all the time.\n\nA: I am not sure if I can help - but the terminology you should search for is \nGoogle calendar panel indicator \nI installed a number of these panel indicators in Trusty, as the brightness up / down keys never worked on my Vaio F keys - but I have no idea where you can get them for 16.04 but;\nthis link \ntakes you to the page with about 30 indicators which work with Trusty. \nCheck out panel indicator 13 - it is for google calendar.

In past I used to use NX server and client to remotely connect multiple users to one Linux machine. It was a nice gimmick as even though it was the same machine every user had his own desktop environment. All the users could work at the same time on the remote machine. Furthermore, there used to be a nice option where the remote resolution adapted to the client's vnc window. If the client's window was resized, the remote resolution automatically adapted itself (no scaling, but true resolution). Unfortunately, NX is no option today anymore and freeNX does not work properly on newer Ubuntu versions.\nIs there any alternative to NX having similar or same functionality?\n\nA: X2GO is pretty good replacement for NX.\n", "Q: Ubuntu Wi-fi driver not working on my Acer Aspire V15 Nitro??

Since I was thinking that a backup software should be silent and invisible, this is quite annoying.\n\nWould be ok if it takes four or five times more than the time it takes now to do its things, but consuming less cpu and being more quiet.\nIs there a silent mode for the Backups software or a better alternative backup software for Ubuntu?\n\nA: Honestly, I've never heard of the program you're using.\nI personally prefer rsnapshot (http://rsnapshot.org/) for my backup needs.  The Ubuntu package is the same name.\nSince it uses hardlinks, the first time it runs may use a lot of CPU time, but afterwards, it won't.  (Especially if you have few files that change between backups -- which is the case for most people.)  Likewise, it won't use much diskspace over time.\nHaving said that, I schedule backups in the middle of the night.  So other than when I'm testing the configuration file, I don't really have a chance to notice the CPU time.  This is unrelated to whether or not you are running this on a server; rsnapshot can be run on the command line.  Or, you can create a short-cut on your desktop to it.\nAnother suggestion is to just renice the program so that it runs at a lower priority.  If you need to do this automatically, then some short bash programming will be needed.  See, for example, https://talk.maemo.org/showthread.php?t=36870 or just search for the phrase \"automatic renice\".\nOff the top of my head, I don't know how to do it, but my guess is that you would have to:\n\n\n*\n\n*write a bash script that finds out the process ID\n\n*run renice on it\n\n*put this script in a cronjob and either make it run right after your backup starts or have it run repeatedly (i.e., every hour)\n\n\nI guess the script might look like this, but you really need to clean this up as it's really off the top of my head:\n #!/bin/bash\n PID=`ps -ef | grep \"<program name>\" | grep -v \"grep\" | tr -s ' ' | cut -f 2 -d ' '  | head -n 1`\n renice -10 ${PID}\n\nThe PID line does this in order:\n\n\n*\n\n*Gets a list of processes.\n\n*Searches for .\n\n*Removes any line that has both  and \"grep\".\n\n*Replace consecutive spaces into a single space.\n\n*Grab the second column's values using space as a delimiter.\n\n*Take the first line.\n\n\nHope this helps get you started!\n\nA: Ubuntu Backup a.k.a. DejaDup uses duplicity as the backend. There was a bug in duplicity in 2014 that was fixed that caused this. It still happens though, so you could report another bug in duplicity. This bug only affects one physical core, so the computer should still be responsive on multi-CPU machines. Otherwise you may consider the various other backup alternatives, or have your computer backup when you're not using it. \nYou could also try a larger blocksize?\nduplicity --max-blocksize 4096 [full/incremental] src dest\n\n   --max-blocksize number\n          determines the number of the blocks examined for changes during the diff process.  For files < 1MB\n          the blocksize is a constant of 512.  For files over 1MB the size is given by:\n\n          file_blocksize = int((file_len / (2000 * 512)) * 512)\n          return min(file_blocksize, globals.max_blocksize)\n\n          where globals.max_blocksize defaults to 2048.  If you specify a larger max_blocksize, your difftar\n          files will be larger, but your sigtar files will be smaller.  If you specify a smaller max_blocksize,\n          the reverse occurs.  The --max-blocksize option should be in multiples of 512.\n\n\n", "Q: Release name of current signed kernel Is the output of uname -r always like 4.2.0-37-generic, or would it show the postfix .efi.signed denoting it is a signed kernel, if a signed kernel is booted on a machine (with UEFI) requiring such a kernel?\nThe output of linux-version list shows this postfix for signed kernels.\n\nA: The output of uname -r depends on the topmost Makefile of your kernel source. You can edit it. For example, the Makefile in your case would look like this.\nVERSION = 4\nPATCHLEVEL = 2\nSUBLEVEL = 0\nEXTRAVERSION = -37-generic\n\nYou can change the EXTRAVERSION field, to change the output of uname -r\n", "Q: What causes the constant messages \"the file was changed on disk; reload, ignore?\" The issue\nWhile (in this case) editing a .css file in Bluefish, I am switching to the browser to reload the page and test the result.

If so, please disregard the iptables part of the answer and skip to the SSH config part...\nIs it a matter of wanting the transport to be encrypted, or is it simply a matter of getting through the firewall?\nGetting through the firewall could be as simple as adding something like:\niptables -A INPUT -i eth0 -p tcp -s aa.bb.cc.dd/32 --dport 7878 -m state --state NEW,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT\n\nIf you're looking for a good resource on configuring an SSH connection take a look here: http://nerderati.com/2011/03/17/simplify-your-life-with-an-ssh-config-file/\nThere's too much to be said on the subject to hash it all out here.\nOnce you have the basic ssh config set up it should be relatively trivial to create a script to start the connection (including a forwarded port) which could for example be executed when your network interface comes up, similar to the way a lot of people have their iptables rules loaded.\nTake a look in /etc/network/if-up.d/ (off the top of my head) for examples.\nHope this gets you started!\n", "Q: My Huawei E303F dongle detected but unable to connect to the internet in ubundu 15.10?

Can I still use them to install for example the packages for utopic at my own risk? Or is there a PPA with packages for trusty? And no, I can not upgrade to utopic right now.\n\nA: As you can see from the link, Kdenlive is available via the default Ubuntu 14.04 repository.  If you are having problems with the default installation, you might consider posting a description of the problem which might be resolved by some workaround with some of the codecs or other system libraries and utilities that are part of Trusty.\nA ppa provided for an earlier version might be more compatible than a ppa provided for a later OS version, because newer OS' often comes with upgraded components (libraries and functions) that might not be totally compatible with a previous version of Ubuntu.  Trying to update each library with to make your installation compatible to a later OS might take more work that you would anticipate than just upgrading to the later OS, which you have already specified that you are not ready to do.\nYou can, alternatively, review the daily built page that includes very up-to-date links to kdenlive tarballs:\nKdenlive Daily Builds\nWhen installing packages from tarball you usually have a choice of alternate location install, which allows you to either run your daily built install (which might have some glitches) or the official release, separately.\nThe packages I install from tarball or from compiled source, I install in a subdirectory of /opt.\n\nAs mentioned above, I'm certain that you'd experience more work trying to fix incompatible libraries and modules using a later ppa than you would have in upgrading your OS where you would have full support for your OS by upgrading.\nJust looking at the fact that they don't maintain the current 14.04 LTS in their ppa support makes it appear there might be compatible issues that they are not prepared to deal with.

Type it.\n\n*Your computer should turn off.\n\n\n*Switch it back on.\n\n\nIf you application (such as the terminal you used above) are still there, that means hibernation works!\nIf your machine rebooted from scratch after you turned it on, or if it didn't turn off at all (i.e. if it only blinked and came back online immediately), then it means hibernation doesn't work yet on your computer.\nIf hibernation works, you can enable it by editing a PolKit file, by typing this command on the same terminal you opened above:\nsudo nano /etc/polkit-1/localauthority/50-local.d/com.ubuntu.enable-hibernate.pkla\n\nand add the following text into that file:\n[Re-enable hibernate by default in upower]\nIdentity=unix-user:*\nAction=org.freedesktop.upower.hibernate\nResultActive=yes\n\n[Re-enable hibernate by default in logind]\nIdentity=unix-user:*\nAction=org.freedesktop.login1.hibernate;org.freedesktop.login1.hibernate-multiple-sessions\nResultActive=yes\n\nSave by pressing Ctrl+O then enter and then exit nano by pressing Ctrl+X. Now the hibernation should ready to be use by you, this should work.\n", "Q: Script not running on resume/wakeup in Ubuntu I have a script named 999_thaw_flash.sh in my /etc/pm/sleep.d\nThe script follows like this :-\nexport DISPLAY=:0\n#!/bin/bash\ncase \"{$1}\" in\n    resume|thaw)\nlynx --dump link1 >> file1\nlynx --dump link2 >> file1\nlynx --dump link3 >> file1\n\ngrep \"magnet:?xt=urn:btih:\" file1 > file2\n\nsed -i 's/^......//' file2\n\nawk '/org%3A1337%2Fannounce/{print;print \"\";next}1' file2 >> file3\n\nlines=$(wc -l < file3)\n\necho \"no. of line $lines\"\n    if grep silicon+valley+s03e03+720p+hdtv+x265+hevc+ file3;\n        then\n            lineno=$(grep -n silicon+valley+s03e03+720p+hdtv+x265+hevc+ file3 | cut -d : -f 1)\n            echo \"current line no :-\" $lineno\n            link=$(head -n $lineno file3 | tail -1)\n            echo $link\n                notify-send -i /home/hasan/Desktop/flash/Flash.ico 'Flash is Running' 'Getting silicon valley episode 3'\n                transmission-remote -a $link\n                echo $link >> flush\n                echo \"\\n\\n\" >> flush\n\n    fi\n\n    if grep silicon+valley+s03e05+720p+hdtv+x265+hevc+ file3;\n        then\n            lineno=$(grep -n silicon+valley+s03e05+720p+hdtv+x265+hevc+ file3 | cut -d : -f 1)\n            echo \"current line no :-\" $lineno\n            link=$(head -n $lineno file3 | tail -1)\n            echo $link\n                notify-send -i /home/hasan/Desktop/flash/Flash.ico 'Flash is Running' 'Getting silicon valley episode 5'\n                transmission-remote -a $link\n                echo $link >> flush\n                echo \"\\n\\n\" >> flush\n    fi\n\n    if grep silicon+valley+s03e06+720p+hdtv+x265+hevc+ file3;\n        then\n            lineno=$(grep -n silicon+valley+s03e06+720p+hdtv+x265+hevc+ file3 | cut -d : -f 1)\n            echo \"current line no :-\" $lineno\n            link=$(head -n $lineno file3 | tail -1)\n            echo $link\n            notify-send -i /home/hasan/Desktop/flash/Flash.ico 'Flash is Running' 'Getting silicon valley episode 6'\n            echo episode 6 of silicon valley online\n                transmission-remote -a $link\n                echo $link >> flush\n                echo \"\\n\\n\" >> flush\n    fi\n    if grep silicon+valley+s03e07+720p+hdtv+x265+hevc+ file3;\n        then\n            lineno=$(grep -n silicon+valley+s03e07+720p+hdtv+x265+hevc+ file3 | cut -d : -f 1)\n            echo \"current line no :-\" $lineno\n            link=$(head -n $lineno file3 | tail -1)\n            echo $link\n            notify-send -i /home/hasan/Desktop/flash/Flash.ico 'Flash is Running' 'Getting silicon valley episode 7'\n            echo episode 7 of silicon valley online\n                transmission-remote -a $link\n                echo $link >> flush\n                echo \"\\n\\n\" >> flush\n    fi\n    if grep silicon+valley+s03e08+720p+hdtv+x265+hevc+ file3;\n        then\n            lineno=$(grep -n silicon+valley+s03e08+720p+hdtv+x265+hevc+ file3 | cut -d : -f 1)\n            echo \"current line no :-\" $lineno\n            link=$(head -n $lineno file3 | tail -1)\n            echo $link\n            notify-send -i /home/hasan/Desktop/flash/Flash.ico 'Flash is Running' 'Getting silicon valley episode 8'\n            echo episode 8 of silicon valley online\n                transmission-remote -a $link\n                echo $link >> flush\n                echo \"\\n\\n\" >> flush\n    fi\n    if grep silicon+valley+s03e09+720p+hdtv+x265+hevc+ file3;\n        then\n            lineno=$(grep -n silicon+valley+s03e09+720p+hdtv+x265+hevc+ file3 | cut -d : -f 1)\n            echo \"current line no :-\" $lineno\n            link=$(head -n $lineno file3 | tail -1)\n            echo $\n            notify-send -i /home/hasan/Desktop/flash/Flash.ico 'Flash is Running' 'Getting silicon valley episode 9'\n            echo episode 9 of silicon valley online\n                transmission-remote -a $link\n                echo $link >> flush\n                echo \"\\n\\n\" >> flush\n    fi\n    if grep silicon+valley+s03e10+720p+hdtv+x265+hevc+ file3;\n        then\n            lineno=$(grep -n silicon+valley+s03e10+720p+hdtv+x265+hevc+ file3 | cut -d : -f 1)\n            echo \"current line no :-\" $lineno\n            link=$(head -n $lineno file3 | tail -1)\n            echo $link\n            notify-send -i /home/hasan/Desktop/flash/Flash.ico 'Flash is Running' 'Getting silicon valley episode 10'\n            echo episode 10 of silicon valley online\n                transmission-remote -a $link\n                echo $link >> flush\n                echo \"\\n\\n\" >> flush\n    fi\n    ;;\nesac    \n\nI hope that syntax is correct and the placement of script is in correct folder.\nThe script does not execute on system resume.\nWhere am I going wrong ?\nI have tried :- Run Script on Wakeup?\nhow to execute a command after resume from suspend?

I see this has been viewed many times.\nI had to use a sleep/wake script to manually unmount/mount some network share folders that would hang otherwise on resume. I had a lot of trouble with setting this up, and discovered you need the \"PATH=/sbin:/usr/sbin:/bin:/usr/bin\" line to execute any terminal commands. You can use a basic script template like this for an example:\n#!/bin/sh\n\nPATH=/sbin:/usr/sbin:/bin:/usr/bin #required to execute terminal commands\n\ncase \"$1\" in\n    pre) #sleep\n            #script for executing with hibernation\n    ;;\n    post) #resume\n            #script here for resuming\n    ;;\nesac\n\nMake sure the script is executable by typing \"chmod +x /path/to/script/\" in terminal. Make sure root is the owner with \"sudo chown root:root /path/to/script/\".\nHope this helps. Running on Ubuntu 20.04 and Linux Mint 20.2.\n", "Q: How do I copy Command Line Text?

As someone mentioned above though the system specific requires python 2.7 for certain things... That being said you can upgrade pip without negatively impacting that but you can also install 3.5 alongside if you want to.\nthe -H is a flag for sudo that requests that the security policy set the HOME environment\n                 variable to the home directory specified by the target user's\n                 password database entry.

It worked for me.\nsudo apt-get remove python-pip\nsudo easy_install pip\n\n\nA: Its not a good idea to update the system python unless you are actually working on ubuntu code and have a specific reason to. There are a lot of system dependencies you can break by updating with pip instead of using the python libs in the APT repository.\nIf you are developing python applications and need to change versions of libraries then you should use either a the --user options to pip or create a virtualenv to store your users versions of the libs.\nBoth of these methods will gracefully fall back to using system libs if they don't have their own copies, virtualenv has more options on how to control that feedback.\npip with --user\nThis is as easy as just adding --user to the end of all your pip commands, this will put your python libs in ~/.local/lib/pythonX.X (where X.X is your python version number) , they will be looked for here first just be careful about doing this for root if you have to run via sudo as it may effect the system python.\nvirtualenv\nThis works in a similar way to that above but is less tied to a specific user so doesn't have the sudo limitation, you can also clone a virtualenv and upgrade it to test changes thus allowing you to revert if it sucks.\nhttp://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/\n\nA: It seems like this might be a problem with installing the .whl file for pip 8.1.2.

Try converting your mailbox to another of the supported formats like Maildir , Mork or MozStorage which can better handle concurrent accesses.\nBe sure to back up your mail box first and to test the other formats before relying on them.\n\nA: Actually, I am not going to move to another software because I'm very happy with Thunderbird. \nAnd after a little thinking, I went and Edited Account Settings (not preferences, what did mislead me from the beginning) and changed  the Server Settings for the accounts.\n\n\n*\n\n*instead of having both being checked at start, I have now the main one being checked at start;\n\n*then in case I forget to do a manual Get Message (top left hand corner), I have the other account checked after 3 minutes.\n\n\n\n", "Q: Fan stuck at 257 RPM Thinkpad Yoga S1 and Ubuntu 16.04 I was thinking for some time that my laptop seems to be hotter than it's supposed to and I recently downloaded psensor to have a look at what's going on.

When you change only any software version you do an update.  \nAfter three days of trying i gave up and downloaded an ISO image and installed it via liveUSB.  \nAnyways, you should be aware that an upgrade is possible via LiveUSB and it is faster than the Terminal command upgrade. USB file transfer is faster and much more reliable than an internet connection. I personally prefer do to a completely new install with each Ubuntu version because i don't inherit all the junk from previous one and i don't mess up the sources list with wrong ppas.

You'll also need to have read/write access to the .Xauthority file.\nPeople commonly loose access to some of the areas of their home directory by working in the personal space as root, using the elevated sudo command.\nThere are also occasions where the /home folder is located on a separate drive or partition that for some reason didn't mount.\nYou can check this by using Alt+Cntrl+F2 to go to a console screen and logging in.\nIf you succeed in logging in you can check to see which components you can't access with this command:\nYou can get a complete list of files you don't own by running these steps:\n$ cd\n$ cd ..\n$ find ./yourID ! -user yourID\n\nYou mainly have to own the following:\n./ (your home directory)\n.Xauthority\n\nIf it's the most commonly .Xauthority permission problem you can fix that by either changing owner to your ID or removing it and allowing it to be automatically recreated the next time you log into the desktop.\nTo change owner to your id:\n$ sudo chown yourid:yourid .Xauthority\n\nTo remove it and allow it to automatically be recreated:\n$ sudo mv .Xauthority .Xauthority.old\n\nThe detailed explanation was to not just give the direct resolution, but to point out, as many ask, what causes this to happen.\n", "Q: Mix between Gnome 2 menu an Unity possible? I very much like the old Gnome 2 menu style Ubuntu used to have before switching to Unity. Still, I like many of the new Unity features, too! Meanwhile though I've been using Ubuntu in many different ways with many different programs installed. If you have only a few programs in use, you can easily keep them in an orderly way within the launcher on the left side, but if you have many programs (i.e. +20) installed, this one bar just won't do a good job, because it tries to squeeze all them to this left bar area. The Ubuntu opened with the super-key is an alternative way, where you can find all your programs by typing the application name, but when you have many programs installed it can happen that you know what program you wanted to use, but you just cannot remember the name. Searching for it in this Ubuntu menu can be quite cumbersome. The old style menu was fantastic for this. Every program was categorised in Graphics, Office, Programming, etc. I found it always very easy to use.\nIs there any addon or plugin for Unity to get back this old style categorised menu? It'd be nice to have that without having to change to another desktop environment.\n\nA: There is no way to get Unity to show programs in categories. If you have only problems putting many programs into the left bar, you can shrink the buttons there (using Unity Tweak Tool).\nOtherwise, you can use Cinnamon instead of Unity to have most of the applets and searches and still retain the menu with programs ordered in categories.\nAnother possibility is using Cairo Dock. It adds a bottom bar that has programs listed in categories, in other features it's mostly similar to Mac.\n", "Q: Software Centre? I just now installed Ubuntu 16.04.

I'll describe some ways for obtaining more data and performing a little connection debug. Gather data from all of those ideas and append all of that output to your original question (by \"edit\" feature).\nDeffinately do not make more screenshots of your peculiar terminal(s) (here, for new users apply limits for images & links per post). Select output from terminal simply by using your mouse, then right-click, \"Copy\" and then right-click in any editor and \"Paste\" (or Ctrl+V).\n\nLet's commence the investigation (use ethernet device for those):\n\n\n*\n\n*As you have already performed ifconfig eth0, you got the following most important data:\n\n\n*\n\n*your device's \"MAC Address\" (HWaddr 20:47:47:19:52:b8)\n\n*your local \"IP Address\" (inet addr:192.168.100.35)\n\n*your \"Subnet Mask\" (Mask:255.255.255.0)\n\n\n*Now we know, that we should expect following \"Gateway\": 192.168.100.1 (f.e. This or That tool can calculate that, even if it's obvious).\n\n*Now you can obtain your routes using system's method: route -n. The lines with \"Iface | eth0\" and \"Flags | UG\" should show that expected \"Gateway | 192.168.100.1\" (make sure, but save/remember entire output/results anyway)\nYou didn't tell what type(s) of network(s) are you running (perhaps reveal that secret?). I'm assuming that you are using some home router that also provides wireless connections, that you refered to as working. If so:\n\n\n*Open your router's configuration (for most routers you just open: http://192.168.100.1) and investigate whatever you can find there and compare that to what your system outputed (everything from above steps).\n\n*Additionally check:\n\n\n*\n\n*whether on not \"DHCP\" is enabled and what's it's range (e.g. 192.168.100.2 - 192.168.100.254)\n\n*whether or not there's a \"Static DHCP\" set specifically for your MAC (20:47:47:19:52:b8), if so remove it for now (re-add later, after fixing a problem)\n\n\n*Perform a ping from your machine, to see if it properly bounces-back of your router: ping 192.168.100.1.\n\n*If you have different network device/computer, ping that problematic one from it: ping 192.168.100.35.\n\n*Get back to your troubled machine and then try some external servers, like: ping ubuntu.com.\n\n*Make a second attempt to perform a backup of your iptables and check content of outputed file: sudo iptables-save /home/rishabh/my.iptables.backup.\n\n*If it did not returned anything, try sudo iptables-save alone and see if it outputs something to your terminal (if it does, perhaps you have a problem with writing to your own, home directory, which would be bizzare for normal Ubuntu)\n\n*Additionally prove what version of Ubuntu are you actually using by providing output from this command: lsb_release -a (your question contains two different versions: 12.04 in title and 14.04 in tags)\n\nAnd now it's time for couple ideas for fixing network connection without actually destroying anything that can't be easily fixed. After performing each one, test if it actually helped. Good method of testing is actually that ping ubuntu.com or simply opening any website or whatever else you normally do. Here we go:\n\n\n*\n\n*Try changing your MTU to 1492: sudo ifconfig eth0 mtu 1492 (if won't help after that, restore original: sudo ifconfig eth0 mtu 1500)\n\n*Open network connection manager (Alt+F2 & enter nm-connection-editor or if it does not open it, search it in your menu or that icon from it's applet that should be on a panel), delete your current ethernet connection(s) (perphaps you even got duplicates?) and add only that one, desired eth0 again\n\n*Try configuring IP's manually in this same network manager's connection configuration \"IPv4 tab\" (phew!), by switching method from \"Automatic (DHCP)\" to \"Manual\". Enter there all data you already have and verified are OK (\"Local IP\", \"Subnet Mask\", \"Gateway\").\n\n*You might also have a firewall while not realizing it. Use a dpkg-method to be 99.9+% sure for gufw (that's default in latest Ubuntu's): dpkg -l gufw. If you do have that, open it: Alt+F2 & enter gufw (or look for it in menu) and disable it if it's working.\n\n*Use that dpkg-method one more time: dpkg -l iptables to double-check if it still outputs that default, empty one (from your second screen) and try completely flushing iptables and then allow it for everything on default:\n\nsudo iptables -Z\nsudo iptables -F\nsudo iptables -X\nsudo iptables --policy INPUT ACCEPT\nsudo iptables --policy OUTPUT ACCEPT\nsudo iptables --policy FORWARD ACCEPT\n\nRun dpkg -l iptables again and see if anything had changed.\n\n\n*Test different ethernet cable, one broken line does not neccesarily means not establishing connection at all (problem of broken line(s) occurs very rarly, usually in presence of hungry mice)\n\n\nOK... that's it for today. Try all that and hopefully one of those will help, if not maybe data you gather + experience from trying those fixes (you can also try describing what you have noticed after all those attempts) will give us some additional clues.\n\nAdditionally, if flushing iptables in some strange way will make everything worse, here's how you restore that backup:\nsudo iptables-restore < /home/rishabh/my.iptables.backup\n\n", "Q: Looking for the Ubuntu wallpaper with the satellite and blue sky?

However it doesn't kill the active owncloud instance and it doesn't start a new one either when I resume after a suspend.\nWhen I run the script in terminal as the current user it works as I want it to.\nWhen I run it in root it kills the owncloud instance, but it then start a new one without the server settings etc. I've worked around that with sudo -H -u <user> bash <....> to start it as another user, but then it doesn't work because it doesn't have the keychain unlocked.\nHow can I /usr/bin/owncloud from within the script (which is run as root) as the current user with the current session so that the icon is also added to the statusbar?\n\nA: Your missing the DISPLAY definition. Also, making it depend on Network connection is better. For me on arch linux works:\n/etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/20-owncloud\n #!/bin/sh\n case \"$2\" in\n       up)\n               # is called as soon as connection is up\n               env DISPLAY=:0 sudo -u yourusername owncloud\n       ;;\n       down)\n               # yes, maybe that is better in system-sleep\n               killall owncloud\n       ;;\nesac\n\nThe script has to be owned by root:\nsudo chown root:root /etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/20-owncloud\n\nDon't forget to make that script executable: \nsudo chmod 755 /etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/20-owncloud\n\nand start/enable the NetworkManager dispatcher:\nsudo systemctl start NetworkManager-dispatcher.service\nsudo systemctl enable NetworkManager-dispatcher.service\n\nAt least on arch it works that way, maybe slightly other names in ubuntu.\n", "Q: Apt-Get Update Not Working, Can't Read Log For some reason, when I try to use sudo apt-get update, it fails, and gives me this:\n user@my-computer:~$ sudo apt-get update\nHit:1 http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu xenial InRelease\nIgn:2 http:/dl.google.com/linux/chrome/deb stable InRelease\nHit:3 http:/security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu xenial-security InRelease\nIgn:4 http:/old-releases.ubuntu.com/ubuntu raring InRelease\nHit:5 http:/us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu xenial-updates InRelease\nGet:6 http:/deb.opera.com/opera stable InRelease [2,592 B]\nHit:7 http:/dl.google.com/linux/chrome/deb stable Release\nHit:8 http:/archive.canonical.com/ubuntu xenial InRelease\nHit:9 http:/ppa.launchpad.net/appgrid/stable/ubuntu xenial InRelease\nHit:10 http:/us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu xenial-backports InRelease\nHit:12 http:/old-releases.ubuntu.com/ubuntu raring Release\nHit:13 http:/ppa.launchpad.net/otto-kesselgulasch/gimp/ubuntu xenial InRelease\nIgn:14 http:/download.videolan.org/pub/debian/stable  InRelease\nIgn:6 http:/deb.opera.com/opera stable InRelease\nHit:11 http:/screenshots.getdeb.net xenial-getdeb InRelease\nHit:15 http:/ppa.launchpad.net/videolan/stable-daily/ubuntu xenial InRelease\nHit:17 http:/ppa.launchpad.net/webupd8team/java/ubuntu xenial InRelease\nHit:18 http:/download.videolan.org/pub/debian/stable  Release\nHit:19 http:/ppa.launchpad.net/webupd8team/y-ppa-manager/ubuntu xenial InRelease\nFetched 2,592 B in 1s (1,580 B/s)\n/usr/share/appgrid/appdata/helpers.py:9: PyGIWarning: Soup was imported without specifying a version first.

Before doing so I wanted to get rid of 1.13 so they didn't clash. However after running a apt-get purge libglew1.13, and restarting the PC, many things aren't showing up correctly. I imagine this is due to removing other dependencies with it...\nCould someone please tell me how to fix this? I can reinstall packages again via the terminal.

My laptop is an Acer Aspire E13, Intel Pentium N3540 no graphics card. I am duel booting this laptop, no issues with windows suggesting it is not a hardware issue.\nSpecifically the fault is a freeze of Ubuntu when using unity with no obvious trigger. Once frozen no response at all can be elicited.\nI originally thought this may be a flash problem as I have in the past had similar problems with flash plugins and Ubuntu/other linux distros. However purging and reinstalling does not seem to improve the situation. I have also tried a number of different browsers in an attempt to see if this effects the frequency of the fault, it doesn't seem to. I also attempted turning off hardware acceleration again no fix.\nThe major issue I have is that the freeze is total, there is no way to move from tty7 (unity) to tty1-6 in an attempt to read the logs and because a forced shutdown is the only way to get a response I can find no record of the fault after restart.\nHow can I go about debugging this fault? Has anyone seen a similar fault and know the solution?\nThanks in advance  \n\nA: I use Ubuntu-MATE 16.04 and I have freezes when i play dota 2 but I think this is a steam and radeon driver problem. About identifying the problem:\n\n\n*\n\n*If it's an xorg problem the you can see the file ~/.xsession-errors or the file /var/log/Xorg.0.log as described here:\nWhere is Xserver log file located?\n\n*There's also the application Logs from the package gnome-logs (I use the application Log File Viewer from the package mate-utils) to see various log files.\n\n*If you are suspicious what application causes the problem, for example firefox, then run in terminal firefox |tee firefox.txt and this will create a firefox.txt file at your home folder with the output of the command firefox, so even if your system freezes then you can read the file firefox.txt afterwards and see if there was an error.\n\n\nHope that helps.\n\nA: Try this... it stopped the hangs with mine.

However, everywhere I see, reviews say not to install Xubuntu 16.04 because it is full of bugs. Yet, when I look at the download for Xubuntu 14.04, it says its end of life is in April 2017.\nWith this in mind, what version of Xubuntu should I install? I just need 2-3 years with a trustworthy, minimal-bug ridden OS.\nThanks!\n\nA: I don't know where you read that 16.04 is \"full of bugs\".  What I do know though, is that I have been using it since April 23 and apart from that appstreamcli bug that appeared a few days ago and was fixed right away (and of course it was not a Xubuntu related bug) I haven't seen any reason why someone should stay away from it.\nIf on the other hand, you prefer to use a safer strategy, you can install 14.04, wait until 16.10 is released (October 2016) so that its kernel will also be available to 16.04 as an official hardware enablement upgrade and install 16.04 by that time.\nPersonally, I prefer installing new releases from scratch instead of upgrading older ones because upgrades do produce bugs sometimes.\n\nA: If your laptop is low-spec NOW, just imagine how it will be 3 years into the future: even lower-spec (compared to that day's standards).  \nI always found Lubuntu running better than Xubuntu on low-spec PCs. I have a laptop like 7 years old. I couldn't run the newest Xubuntu in a decent manner on it, but the newest Lubuntu works like a charm on it. Because lxde is simpler, smaller and faster than xfce. I admit it might seem uglier to the user's eye at first glance, but it proves really useful and decent (with some little tweaks).  \nJust give LXDE a try. It's a beautified Lubuntu.  \nSo so sorry about the typo. I meant LXLE, not LXDE. LXLE is a beautified Lubuntu.\n\nA: The answer is simple - install 14.04 LTS and if you ever need it, just upgrade to 16.04, by that time it will be bug-free and flawless.\n\nA: I would opt for using 14.04 for the time being. It's still supported even though it's end of life is April next year. When the time comes for you to switch to the newer LTS version you'll be able to do this relatively easily. So if you're worried about the new version containing bugs, opt for 14.04 and give it a few months for those bugs to be ironed out.\n\nA: The primary reason for using Xubuntu for me was that it does not assume 3D-accelerated graphics.  I had issues running regular Ubuntu in a VM, because Unity did not play nicely with VMs.  (This may no longer be the case, but at the time it certainly was.)\nFor running Ubuntu actually on the hardware though, I honestly can't see any recent machine having any problems at all.  If you have a strong reason for needing 99% of processor resources instead of 95%, then OK - but in that case your biggest problem is starting from having a crappy laptop, and squeezing out an extra few percent is not going to make enough difference for you to notice.\n", "Q: Install Win7 theme on Ubuntu 16.04 I'm totally new to Ubuntu.

If so, how?\n\nA: First, make sure myscript.py is executable by doing chmod +x myscript.py. Second, ensure that the shebang #!/usr/bin/env python appears as the first line of myscript.py. You then execute the script using ./myscript.py [arguments].\n\nA: Add\n#!/usr/bin/python\n\nto the first line of your script.  This presumes that you have python installed and runnable from /usr/bin, and that the current directory (.) is in your PATH environment variable (not the default,but you can change it in your home .profile  file).\n\nA: Edit your script so your first line is a shebang pointing to the desired interpreter's executable path. \nFirst, find where the python executable is, with which python.\nThen, in your script's first line, add \n#!/path/to/python\n\nThen run\nmkdir $HOME/bin\n\nAnd put your script there.\nThat should do it!\n", "Q: How to resolve \"sign in error\" when using Youtube-dl for downloading my personal, private HOA video (hangout chats) I am on 14.04 LTS.

The point to my long story is the drive could be bad, and that is why you can't boot from it.\nSo the answer given about burning a USB memory stick might be the answer.\nChris\n", "Q: notify-send not showing notification when playing video I have a script (which is called on keyboard button press) that instantly shows a notification with notify-send and then does some other things.\nIt works perfectly, except in the following cases it does not show any notifications:\n\n\n*\n\n*when a youtube video is playing (not necessarily in the active tab)\n\n*when a vimeo video is playing\n\n*when vlc player is opened\n\n\nStrangely enough it does show a notification when:\n\n\n*\n\n*the youtube or vimeo video is paused\n\n\nTo clairify: The script is always called, and always produces a result.

Any help is appreciated.\n\nA: First, I want to say sorry for your loss.\nI found two possible answers, but they look similar to what you have already done, except the code it's a little different.  In the first found here:\nHow to open UDF Volume\nthe command looks like this:\nsudo mount -t udf /dev/sr0 /cdrom\n\nThis one seems simpler that what you have, the second looks a little more like your code, the second is found here:\nhttp://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1095717\nThe code looks like this:\nsudo mount -t iso9660,udf /dev/xxx /yyy/zzz\n\nWhere xxx is your DVD (you can check it with System -> Administration -> Disk utils) and /yyy/zzz is the place where you want the files to be mounted.\nI might try:\nsudo mount -t iso9660,udf /dev/sr0 /cdrom\nTo make it simpler.  \nYour last ditch effort might be to go to Kinkos, (if in the US) and rent one of their Windows machines ( I may be dating myself, but it seems like a few years ago they had a system like that.) and then open the disks there.\nIf you are sure they are photos, CVS has devices for opening picture CD's as well as printing the pics, and perhaps even Costco or Sams club can do the same.\nI wish you all the luck on this, and you are not alone out there, my google searches brought up a lot of similar problems and answers.\nChris\n\nA: Went through the same kinds of experiences with Mac discs.

This post suggests that --prefix[directory] should not be used as the entire library will be installed into [directory].\nI am expecting part of the library to be installed into /usr/include and part into /usr/lib. The documentations should be located inside /usr/share.\n\nA: Actually, you're missing some steps...\nFirst of all, 1.58 is fine for other software in your version of Ubuntu.  Indeed, if you're developing something yourself, then having the latest might be a good idea.\nWhat you downloaded from sourceforge should not be the \"boost binary\".  It should be all source code.  The steps you gave would setup the build's configuration files and perform the build, but you then have to install it.\nSee these instructions http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_61_0/more/getting_started/unix-variants.html .  \nYou are missing this instruction:\nsudo ./b2 install\n\nNevertheless, you should read through all of it.  You should pay particular attention to the point about \"Header only\".  Only some libraries actually need to be built.\nAlso, it is not quite correct that you should not put it in /usr/include.  It's fine if you do -- you will just have to be sure to include it in the directory search in your compilation line.  Putting it in /usr/include does make things a lot easier.  (--prefix is a useful option if you don't have sudo access on the computer)\nPS:  Remember to set the BOOST_ROOT environment variable!\n", "Q: Remove grub and keep only Ubuntu I used to use Windows and Ubuntu on my pc. But I'm no longer a Windows user, now only Ubuntu. I tried to instal Ubuntu over the Windows, but grub still installed and asks every boot which system should it start. Theres a way to remove completly and start straight on Ubuntu?\n\nA: Grub is still needed, it tells the OS what kernel to load. You can hide Grub by changing its settings and make it so that it immediately boots to ubuntu and never shows you any options. An easy program to do this with is grub-customizer and then going through settings to make it so that the autoboot is ubuntu and the time delay is 0.\n", "Q: Minimize using scrolldown I can scroll up on an open app in the launcher to restore a window. Is there any way to minimize by scrolling down?\n\nA: The scroll feature in the Unity launcher is not about restoring or minimizing windows. It is for scrolling through the open windows for that application. If the app only has one window, then that's the only one that will open up, when scrolling. If it has multiple windows open, scrolling on that apps icon will cycle focus through the open windows.\n", "Q: Reinstalling critical files in Recovery Mode I might have accidentaly purged some critical files, causing my Kubuntu 14.04 to not boot past the startup logo.\nBy entering the recovery mode from a LiveUSB, and running sudo apt-get install -f, I am told that there are some unmet dependencies.

Save all of the comments of back ups and what have you.I have googled this though nothing similar comes up, i searched what i could and still nothing, as my knowledge on this area is slim, but here is  the res...I have an LVM across three complete HDDs and partially formatted on the same drive my root is and swap. Three out of four disks are completely formatted for LVM while the This looks like this:\n\n\n*\n\n*sda:\n\n\n*\n\n*sda1: 782GB LVM\n\n\n*sdb:\n\n\n*\n\n*sdb1: 250GB LVM\n\n\n*sdc: \n\n\n*\n\n*sdc3: 32GB LVM\n\n*sdc1: 32GB / ext4\n\n*sdc5: 16GB swap\n\n\n*sdd:\n\n\n*\n\n*sdd1: 250GB LVM\n\n\n*sde:\n\n\n*\n\n*sde1: 250GB LVM\n\n\n\nThe LVM has about 200/250 GB of movies and shows I would like to keep them on there if at all possible.\nWhenever I have the additional drives physically connected the computer boots to a black screen with a blinking cursor and will not let me do anything as after a few keystrokes the machine makes the invalid stroke beeping noise.\nWhen the rest are removed it boots to GRUB and loads normally and works peachy, I have looked up hot swapping my drives, but am a little skeptical about trying that.\nThis is a home server, everything I've done is based off questions others have asked as well as tutorials, I do look a lot of things up, which is probably why I did not know of the precautions when upgrading. ALSO this is not a dual boot, IT is running off an HP machine, but the HDDs are clean of an OS save the one running UBUNTU 16.04\n\nA: So the answer to my problem is semi-unrelated to UBUNTU, Semi because the problem did not exist until i Updated my server to 16.04, but the fix was hardware. After I re installed ubuntu 16.04 twice on my root partition, loosing all the setup I had prior, I learned that some desktops will force SATA0 to be the default OS drive even if one is not located there, I realized this when I booted up the system with all drives mounted that BIOS told me the HDD boot drive order and the one with ROOT was second. After switching the cables around everything seems to be in order. I just mounted the rest of the drives, nothing lost.\n\nA: I had the same symptoms after upgrading to 16.04.\nIn my case it turned out to be a portable USB device was the issue. \nLinux must have been attempting to boot from my USB back up. Unplugging the device and forcing a restart fixed the issue. \n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04: problems upgrading php to 5.6 using ppa:ondrej I've done the following:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:ondrej/php5-5.6\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\nsudo apt-get install php5\nsudo apt-get install libapache2-mod-php5.6\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:ondrej/apache2\n\nWhen I try to disable the old version of php5 with:\nsudo phpdismod php5\n\nI get the error:\nWARNING: Module php5 ini file doesn't exist under /etc/php/5.6/mods-available\nEven if I move the ini file under this directory it gives me the same error.

I did install Ubuntu 14 32 bits in a Pentium 4 3GHz HT with 3GB RAM (max possible). First I used an IDE HD, but since it was too slow, I'd put a SATA HD and the speed increased a little bit. But Ubuntu runs really slowly, barely usable. It was disappointing because I did install this version (14) because I think 16 was too much for this hardware, but I'm not sure if worth to install an even older version (12, 11...). So what I am asking might be subjective a little bit, but I need to hear some specialist opinion on this.\nMy guess is what is making the system slow is the interface (mostly), not the processes. I think is more about the appearance and less about the system itself. I have a simple graphic card: nVidia GF Fx5200 128MB, maybe not enough to run the heavy Ubuntu graphic interface.\nSo if it is possible to speed up Ubuntu, maybe is a better idea to install version 16 (the latest one) and boost it - what you think?\nI'm aware there is other \"variations\" of Ubuntu like Lubuntu, Xubuntu... is there some made for cases like mine? Can I be up to date and be happy?\nOr should I just walk away from Ubuntu and look for another OS to run decently this hardware?\n\nA: Try a different Ubuntu flavor\nUbuntu, which runs on the Unity desktop environment, has a lot of \"eye-candy\" and slows down the system. Use a lighter, faster Ubuntu flavor.\nWhich one?\nLubuntu, or even Xubuntu, is super light. Use it instead of normal Ubuntu. \nUse the newest version\nThe newer, the better. Every Ubuntu version comes with improvments with a newer kernel therefore 16.04 is better.\n\nA: Xubuntu 16.04 is a lightweight XFCE desktop instead of Unity and will run quicker using less memory: https://xubuntu.org/news/xubuntu-16-04-release/\n", "Q: How do I adjust the gamma on my HDMI monitor? I found this question, and that works on my VGA monitor, but my main monitor is connected via HDMI, and xcalib and xgamma don't work on it. How do I reduce the gamma? This is really getting to be an issue because I can hardly use this OS because of how bright the white is.\n\nA: I had this exact problem and was about to post a question on it, but managed to find an answer. \nFirst use:\nxrandr\n\nTo find the name of the output. It could be (HDMI-0 or HDMI-1 etc.)\nThen do:\nxrandr --output <Channel> --brightness <Level>\n\nBrightness is a decimal number from 0 to 1. For example, this is the command I did to fix my problem:\nxrandr --output HDMI-0 --brightness 0.8\n\n\nA: xrandr --output {Channel}  --gamma R:G:B\nfor example:\nxrandr --output HDMI1 --gamma .5:.5:.5\n\nA: I just installed QRedshift to solve the same problem.

Boot into a live USB of Lubuntu and see for yourself!  It won't affect your PC at all and you can try out all the things you mentioned.\n\nA: Yes, you can do everything you can in Ubuntu 16.04. Lubuntu is just Ubuntu with the LXDE desktop environment. Personally, I sometimes prefer LXDE. LXDE is lightweight too so it may be faster.\n\nA: I think that as Lubuntu uses the same repositories as Ubuntu you should be able to install whatever you want. I think it is a good approach to start light and add what you really want.

This is the specification, can someone tell me if 64 bit run smoothly on my Laptop:\nRam - 2gb\nProcessor - Intel® Pentium(R) CPU B950 @ 2.10GHz × 2 \nGraphics - ntel® Sandybridge Mobile x86/MMX/SSE2\n\nA: A quick Google search shows that your processor should be good to run 64 bit. \nLook here under specifications.\nWill it run smooth?  That depends on how you use it. I have run into a rare issue once or twice where I had to load 32 bit libraries to get something to work. But another Google of the issue led me to a fix for that. \nHere's what I would do, either burn an amd64 Ubuntu ISO to disk or make a bootable USB stick if your system sports USB booting.  Start Ubuntu as a live CD rather than choosing to install and see how things work on it. If everything seems to run okay, you should be able to install with relative certainty that it will work for you. \nRemember rule #1 though, Google is your best friend when you run into issues. \nGood luck!\n\nA: Yes it will run perfectly. Your system resembles mine and after doing a little driver research i found that your laptop is good to run Ubuntu. and google chrome will also run smoothly on it , no problems :) \n\nA: In usual cases, you can run 32-bit applications on 64-bit Ubuntu, but you won’t be fully utilizing your system. However, the vice versa is not true. You won’t be able to run 64-bit applications on a 32-bit machine (just imagine, you can place a small container into a big container, but you can’t do that the other way round). When installing applications in Synaptic, you might notice that some software comes with the 32-bit and 64 bit version (only shows up when you are using the 64-bit Ubuntu). You can just pick the one you want. Additionally, not all 32-bit applications will work in 64-bit machine, particularly for applications that require access to system hardware settings.\n\nA: Yep, the Intel B950 is a 64-bit processor so installing Ubuntu 16.04 (64-bit) should work fine and allow you to run 32 and 64-bit software...  Make a bootable flash drive and give it a test.\n", "Q: Determining which account failed to write to a folder I'm trying to start Jenkins hosted through Tomcat7.

If  PC unlocked then someone can check what is the password set for WiFi. Ideally there should not be Show Password option at all. If this is required then Ubuntu should first invoke the person to enter PC password to edit the WiFi password. \n\nA: I think you may have answered your own question.\nIf you are at the lock screen, you cannot access the WIFI settings. \nThis means that an authorized user must be logged in before you can get to those settings.\nNow, the problem sounds to me like you are worried about a security hole that all network admins no matter what platform have to worry about: \nUsers walking away and leaving their PCs unlocked.\nThe best answer here is to enforce a policy of users being reprimanded for not locking their PC when they leave their seats.\nJust FYI, our Windows friends have the same issues.\nhttps://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support/networking-and-connectivity/how-to-find-your-wireless-network-password?os=windows-10\nThis article also covers PCs as well as older versions of Windows.\nUPDATE\nThen what you are really looking for is to request a feature, here is the best place to do that:\nhttps://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/ubuntu-devel-discuss\nBased on reading this thread:\nWhere can I send feature requests?\nBecause as of now this is not a feature in any OS as far as I know, so you will need to start by requesting it as one first.\nChris\n", "Q: How to search for strings in mupdf?

From what I have read you will need to look at Steam for the gaming platform, so before you decide to load Linux on your machine you should go to their website and see if the games you might want to play are available for Linux.  Here is a link to a list:\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/search/?term=&sort_by=_ASC&os=linux&page=1\n\nIf you decide that is what you want to do, I would first try running Linux as a VM, you can download and install VirtualBox on your Mac, and build a VM of Linux on that so you can test it out without overwriting your current OS. Here is a link to VirtualBox, as well as instructions on how to create the VM:\nhttps://www.virtualbox.org/\n\nhttps://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch01.html\n\nYou will need to download an Ubuntu ISO from here:\nhttp://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop\n\nIf you decide that you want to install Linux, then you can burn the ISO to a disk, or USB drive and follow the instructions after that, here is a link to how to do the burning:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/BurningIsoHowto\n\nGood luck\nChris\n\nA: Ubuntu may not always provide the same level of user friendliness that you have become used to in OSX, but it can be a very good operating system if you decide to switch to it for the right reasons.\nThere are actually multiple versions of ubuntu, each of which may differ slightly in their user environment, and sometimes in their level of resource demand (which may be important if you are trying to run the OS on an older system). Based on your reason for wanting to switch to Ubuntu, I would suggest looking  around with a google search at some of these options\nUbuntu is a linux based operating system, and it may be helpful to know that there are also many other freely available linux distributions out there which each differ in their user interface and in some other nuances. You might want to look around at these as well\nAs far as gaming goes, there are some opportunities for gaming on a Ubuntu based system, but this would depend largely on what type of gaming you are looking to get into and what the age and hardware specs of your laptop are.\nAs is often indicated in popular game clients such as steam, modern games must be programed to operate within the architecture provided by the operating system (linux, unix, windows) and therefore not all games that are released are playable on the ubuntu platform. With that being said, there are still many that are and if you download the steam client, you will be able to view whether or not any game is playable on ubuntu. Additionally, Ubuntu has some good emulators if you are looking to go in that direction. It is also of important note that even if a game (emulated or modern) is playable on the ubuntu system, you will have to make sure that your hardware is capable of handling the game as well. In order to play the game, both your hardware and the Ubuntu environment must be compatible with the game. Often times, game clients such as steam can also give you a good idea of what kind of system specs you need to run a game.\nWhen it comes to installing ubuntu, I generally find that the best method is to create a bootable USB and to install from that. If you still have OSX installed on your mac, you may find it useful to download a program called UNetBootin that will help you in creating a bootable USB. If you select which version of linux you would like to use and download it separately, you can use the UNetBootin tool to format the USB so that you can install from it.\nPlease note that creating a bootable USB through this method will format and remove all data from your USB. Also note that depending upon how you choose to install linux, you may overwrite your existing OSX installation and may therefore no longer have OSX as an OS on your machine.\nAll of this being said, Ubuntu, and I think all forms of linux, can be an excellent platform for learning. There are so many different options out there for linux, and linux distributions tend to be so community based that you can really go as deep into working with and manipulating the OS as you want, which is pretty cool.\nGood luck in your search on this! \n\nA: I agree with the comments about Ubuntu and gaming- Is it just gaming you want to do? If you like really old retro 1980's style you could install [Dosbox] and use abandonware. http://www.abandonia.com/\nBut you can create your USB boot on this site:\nUnetbootin\n(I don't think you can't simply boot from a ISO CD with a Mac....)\nYour install depends what you want - and what you want to do.

I believe you can google and find a download pretty easily. If you open the program and click to use the trial version, you should be able to view the 200GB of free space and format it using the tools default formatting settings.

I'm not interested in a dual boot setup. \nWith the intention of changing the boot order so that I can boot from a USB drive,  I swiped the top right screen corner (charm bar) in the win 8 start page,  going to  Settings>Power (shift clicking on Restart) >Troubleshoot>Advanced Options. However, there are no UEFI settings options on this page. \nI would be most appreciative if anyone can offer any suggestions as to where to go from here. \n\nA: If you have your bootable USB ready, you can set the boot order in your BIOS. \nThe difficulty could be accessing the BIOS. In theory, you should just have to shut down the laptop, press the power button and immediately start tapping the F2 key or maybe F12 or F10 to bring up the BIOS. However, you may run into problems. According to this site\n\nBy default, a Windows 8/8.1 shutdown is not a real shutdown. Instead,\n  it is hybrid shutdown where contents of memory are saved to disk. This\n  allows for a faster startup. However, turning on the PC after a hybrid\n  shutdown does not allow for pressing F1 or F12 during startup.\nThere are several ways to enter Setup Utility (F1) or the Boot Menu\n  (F12) on a Microsoft Windows 8/8.1 PC as explained below:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Press and hold the Shift key while selecting the Shutdown option in Windows 8. This will make the PC perform a full shutdown instead of a\n  hybrid shutdown. Then F1 or F12 can be pressed successfully during\n  startup.\n  \n*Select Restart instead of Shutdown. Then F1 or F12 can be pressed successfully during startup.\n  \n*Disable the fast startup option in Control Panel -> Hardware and Sound -> Power Options -> Choose what the power buttons do.\n  \n\nBIOS versions vary, but you should be able to find the boot order menu and figure out how to change it by looking around. Put USB at the top of the list, and with the USB inserted, save configuration and exit. Now the computer should try to boot again, and if the stars are in your favour if you got everything right and the USB you made is compatible then it will boot. Things to consider:\nTry using Legacy Mode instead of UEFI if it is available; this seems to avoid problems for many devices.\nYou might have to disable secure boot, which has to be done in BIOS too. If Windows boots after the boot order has been set to boot USB first, try disabling secure boot.\nIf your laptop boots with 32-bit UEFI only (even for running a 64-bit OS) you will probably need to edit your USB\nIf these tips don't help, visit this well-maintained forum post for more troubleshooting\n\nA: Disable hibernation and Fast startup in Windows - open command prompt as administrator and execute : powercfg /h off.  \nOpen Windows Control Panel -> Power Settings -> uncheck Fast startup. In case it is not visible - enable show hidden settings.  \nShutdown the machine completely, do NOT reboot. Start the computer, boot into the BIOS and select the USB entry with UEFI in front.  \nIn case you still cannot boot from the USB drive, it may be configured not correctly. 3rd party tools often do not create the Ubuntu installation media properly. Use the diskpart tool from Windows, so open command prompt as administrator and execute the following commands :  \ndiskpart\nlist disk  \nselect disk *  \nclean  \ncreate partition primary  \nactive  \nformat fs=fat32 quick  \nassign letter=**  \n\nNote : * = number of USB drive | ** = select a free drive letter\nMount the ISO file and copy the whole content to the USB drive. Now you should be able to boot from the USB drive, wipe the disk - you can either use GParted or the Ubuntu installer to do this - and install Ubuntu as the single operating system on the disk.\n\nA: You need to run bios setup.  There is a switch to turn on boot selection..  boot setup and order is one thing.. hitting another fkey to do boot selection is another.  I usually have better luck doing that latter, but it must be enabled in bios.  I bet this is something that will help you.  My fkey is f2 for bios and f12 for boot selection on Acer.  There is also a thing called set trusted source.  This might also block you.  You will likely need to add trusted source after you install ubuntu.\nTo do this on my Acer (before I killed uefi for legacy), I needed to set a password in security for bios.  Then more options appeared.  There you can logically work out how to set the secure boot file.  My bios brought meto the directory to select the efi file.  Good luck and remember to set the password back to \"nothing\" before you forget what the password was.  This will nearly brick your laptop if you forget.  Type your password very slowly and mindfully.\nSince I had so many problems.. I went legacy.  I am not sure what uefi really buys you since most people turn off secure boot.\n", "Q: Strange problem with libreoffice impress hanging on 16.04 After a clean install of 16.04, I have a strange problem with Libreoffice impress.

I remember some music organizers had this option, but I was looking for something simpler for a headless server. \n\nA: The script below should do the job:\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport random\nimport os\nimport subprocess\nimport shutil\n\n# set the desired number of folders to pick below\nn_selection = 5\n# set the name of the flash drive below\nflashdr = \"Lexar\"\n# set the source directory (with media folders) below\nsourcedr = \"/path/to/mediafiles\"\n# ---\n\ntry:\n    targetdr = [l.split(\"part \")[-1] for l in subprocess.check_output(\"lsblk\")\\\n                .decode(\"utf-8\").splitlines()if l.endswith(flashdr)][0]\nexcept IndexError:\n    pass\nelse:\n    # empty the flash drive\n    for item in os.listdir(targetdr):\n        obj = os.path.join(targetdr, item)\n        try:\n            shutil.rmtree(obj)\n        except NotADirectoryError:\n            os.remove(obj)\n    # list the source dirs\n    srclist = []\n    for dr in  os.listdir(sourcedr):\n        fullpath = os.path.join(sourcedr, dr)\n        if os.path.isdir(fullpath):\n            srclist.append([dr, fullpath])\n    # copy the files\n    for picked in random.sample(srclist, n_selection):\n        shutil.copytree(picked[1], os.path.join(targetdr, picked[0]))\n        srclist.remove(picked)\n\nIt copies directories from the first sub-level of the source-directory into the targeted flash drive. \nThis is what seems to make the most sense, since recursively copying folders, at random, causes a big difference in folder- size and number sub-levels. I added it nevertheless as a second option at the bottom of this answer.\nHow to use\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy the script into an empty file, save it as create_mediausb.py\n\n*In the head section, set the number of files to be selected, the name of the flash drive (the script will find its path) and the source diectory with folders.\n\n*Run the script with the command:\npython3 /path/to/create_mediausb.py \n\n\n*If all works fine, add it to a shortcut key: choose: System Settings > \"Keyboard\" > \"Shortcuts\" > \"Custom Shortcuts\". Click the \"+\" and add the command:\npython3 /path/to/create_mediausb.py \n\nSecond option: recursive selection\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport random\nimport os\nimport subprocess\nimport shutil\n\nn_selection = 5\nflashdr = \"Lexar\"\nsourcedr = \"/home/jacob/Bureaublad/GW_site_nafestival_2015/pix/general\"\n\ntry:\n    targetdr = [l.split(\"part \")[-1] for l in subprocess.check_output(\"lsblk\")\\\n                .decode(\"utf-8\").splitlines()if l.endswith(flashdr)][0]\nexcept IndexError:\n    pass\nelse:\n    # empty the flash drive\n    for item in os.listdir(targetdr):\n        obj = os.path.join(targetdr, item)\n        try:\n            shutil.rmtree(obj)\n        except NotADirectoryError:\n            os.remove(obj)\n    # list the source dirs\n    srclist = []\n    for root, dirs, files in os.walk(sourcedr):\n        for dr in dirs:\n            srclist.append([dr, os.path.join(root, dr)])\n    # copy the files\n    for picked in random.sample(srclist, n_selection):\n        shutil.copytree(picked[1], os.path.join(targetdr, picked[0]))\n        srclist.remove(picked)\n\nThe script:\n\n\n*\n\n*Looks up the path to the flash drive:\ntry:\n    targetdr = [l.split(\"part \")[-1] for l in subprocess.check_output(\"lsblk\")\\\n                .decode(\"utf-8\").splitlines()if l.endswith(flashdr)][0]\nexcept IndexError:\n    pass\n\nIf the flash drive is not found, it ends here\n\n*If the drive was found, it is emptied\n# empty the flash drive\nfor item in os.listdir(targetdr):\n    obj = (targetdr+\"/\"+item)\n    try:\n        shutil.rmtree(obj)\n    except NotADirectoryError:\n        os.remove(obj)\n\n\n*Then, since we need the whole directory list to make an appropriate selection at random, we create a list before making the selection:\n# list the source dirs\nsrclist = []\nfor dr in  os.listdir(sourcedr):\n    fullpath = sourcedr+\"/\"+dr\n    if os.path.isdir(fullpath):\n        srclist.append([dr, fullpath])\n\n\n*The most interesting part is making the selection. We pick a random directory, remove it from the list to prevent double picks, then pick another one at random, remove it, and so on, until we reach the number of desired picks:\n# copy the files\nfor picked in random.sample(srclist, n_selection):\n    shutil.copytree(picked[1], os.path.join(targetdr, picked[0]))\n    srclist.remove(picked)\n\n\nA: you could use find and shuf:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nSOURCE=\"path/to/source\"\nDESTINATION=\"path/to/destination\"\nCOUNT=25\n\nrm -r \"${DESTINATION}/\"*\nfind \"$SOURCE\" -mindepth 2 -maxdepth 2 -type d|shuf -n $COUNT|xargs -d'\\n' -I{} cp -r \"{}\" \"$DESTINATION\"\n\n\nA: I made a script with Python:\nThe script, at GitHub Gist. (Download)\nUsage:\npython3 RandomCopier.py [source folder] [destination folder] [number to copy]\n\nThe copy method:\nNOTE: It will not copy any files directly in the source folder, only those in sub-folders of it.\nSay, the source folder, src is:\nsrc\n|- a\n|  |- file_a\n|  |- file_a_2\n|\n|- b\n|  |- file_b\n|\n|- c\n|  |- file_c\n|\n|- file_src\n\nthen, the destination folder dest would be, with 2 folders randomly copied, like:\ndest\n|- a\n|  |- file_a\n|  |- file_a_2\n|\n|- c\n|  |- file_c\n\n", "Q: Installing Skype on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS I tried my best and viewed recommendations and that stuff on how to install Skype and ended up here, is there a problem?

Save and exit.\nAfter that run:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\n\nA: Skype is already installed, I believe what you actually want is a desktop entry for it, so here's a quick introduction for how to create one:\nCreate a new file in ~/.local/share/applications to make it only available to your user, or /usr/share/applications to make it available to all users. Name it skype.desktop. Now edit the file, and place in it the following:\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=Skype\nComment=Skype Internet Telephony\nExec=env PULSE_LATENCY_MSEC=60 skype %U\nIcon=skype.png\nTerminal=false\nType=Application\nEncoding=UTF-8\nCategories=Network;Application;\nMimeType=x-scheme-handler/skype;\n\nDepending on your Desktop Environment, this may or may not work, but you'll need to investigate desktop entries for your environment if you want to solve that...:\nCreating a .desktop file for a new application\nhttps://specifications.freedesktop.org/desktop-entry-spec/latest/\nKeep in mind that this probably isn't the \"best\" way to get a desktop entry. The better way would likely be to use the software centre where one would be created for you, but I assume you are using this method of installation because the software centre failed you.\n", "Q: How to restart gnome shell but daemonise it from a script? I have a couple of scripts to work around Gnome Shell's inability to work well automatically when swapping between FHD (1080p) and UHD (4k) screens.

The cursor problem still exists in Xubuntu 16.02 but also lost pulseaudio as you describe. My temporary fix which worked for me was to run \"pavucontrol\" as root (gksudo) in a terminal. It seems that pavucontrol does not \"see\" the password from the \"lockout\" input (don't know the proper terms to use here); but the rest of the xfce4 system does.  I used \"light-locker-command --activate\" as a keyboard shortcut to fix the missing cursor after unlock. Are they both related and caused by not picking up the proper permissions?  I'm no expert, just have a inquisitive mind. Best, Papa Smuff!\n\nA: Yes, the sudo pavucontrol failed after a few days, why? Don't know.  What I do that has been working for me, at least for now, is \"pkill pulseaudio\" which resets (respawns?) pavucontrol and all works as expected. Hope this works longer than the sudo fix.

The (admittedly somewhat quirky) solution for me was to open the browser which opened a prompt for unlocking the keychain and then after unlocking try connecting again. \n", "Q: Readonly /dev/loop I am mounting an iso file downloaded from CentOS website using below command as root\nmount -t iso9660 -o loop /root/Centos7ISO/CentOS-7-x86_64-Everything-1511.iso /mnt/CentOS7/\n\nBut it throws this warning about a read-only device\nmount: /dev/loop2 is write-protected, mounting read-only\n\nI searched a lot and found several similar issues but none of the solutions worked in my case.\ntotal 1490\n-r--r--r--. 1 root root      14 Dec 10 06:35 CentOS_BuildTag \ndr-xr-xr-x. 3 root root    2048 Dec 10 06:33 EFI\n-r--r--r--. 1 root root     215 Dec 10 06:35 EULA\n-r--r--r--. 1 root root   18009 Dec 10 06:35 GPL\ndr-xr-xr-x. 3 root root    2048 Dec 10 06:33 images\ndr-xr-xr-x. 2 root root    2048 Dec 10 06:33 isolinux\ndr-xr-xr-x. 2 root root    2048 Dec 10 06:33 LiveOS\ndr-xr-xr-x. 2 root root 1486848 Dec 10 06:34 Packages\ndr-xr-xr-x. 2 root root    4096 Dec 10 06:35 repodata\n-r--r--r--. 1 root root    1690 Dec 10 06:35 RPM-GPG-KEY-CentOS-7\n-r--r--r--. 1 root root    1690 Dec 10 06:35 RPM-GPG-KEY-CentOS-Testing-7\n\nI even tried to use chmod to grant full rw permission to files, but Chmod +777 also does not work since it is a read-only mount.\n\nA: Iso's only do mount read-only.

Should I go for 32-bit Lubuntu, or 64-bit? I know this has been explained very well in general, but I want to ask for advice on this particular situation. I hope it's not considered a duplicate.\nMy friend has this old netbook with only 1 GB of RAM and a 1.66 Ghz dual core. The processor is an Intel Atom N450.\nI'm gonna install Lubuntu 16.04 (Or whatever flavor will perform the best.)\nMy friend will use it for mainly web browsing, movie watching and word processing.\nWe want the system to be as snappy as possible, given the old hardware.\nWhat will perform better, 64-bit or 32-bit? Is Lubuntu indeed the best flavor?\nBy the way, my friend can't afford to upgrade the RAM. He is very poor with a near zero income. He's from a third world country. 20$ is like two weeks' salary for him.\n\nA: Go for the version it is suppose to be able to hold.\nIntel Atom N450 is 64-bit so I would stick to a 64-bit and match the minimum specs for any of the Ubuntu flavours. lUbuntu and xUbuntu are options. Beyond that: do consider alternatives that are around but not Ubuntu; like Puppy Linux or Damn Small Linux.\nRegarding:\n\nWhat will perform better, 64-bit or 32-bit?\n\nThat depends on usage. 64-bit should perform better on heavy usage.\n\nIs Lubuntu indeed the best flavor?\n\nProbably. Or xUbuntu (that is more a preference of desktop: lxde or xfce and not about processor).\n\nA: According to your computer specification, you should use 32bit system.\n64bit system can use more than 4GBs of RAM, but it's useless when you have only one. What is more, 32bit would be safer for this processor. \nLubuntu is the most lightweight distribution (AFAIK), so this is also good for this computer.\n\nA: According to intel atom N450 supports 64bit but for performance reasons you should choose lubuntu 32 bit. \nJust keep in mind that some applications support only 64bit nowadays. \n\n\n*\n\n*One example is Google Chrome which has no 32 bit installer for linux anymore\n\n\n*\n\n*but if you use Chromium you can still install the Adobe Flash Player for 32-bit Chromium directly from Adobe here (downloading the PPAPI .tar.gz and copying libpepflashplayer.so to /usr/lib/adobe-flashplugin/libpepflashplayer.so or similar should work)\n\n\n*Another example is viber which also has only 64bit installer for linux.\n\nA: This question was long ago, but my 2c.\ni386 or 32-bit is more efficient with smaller memory addresses (excluding local addressing) so i386 makes better use of your limited RAM and is generally what I'd pick on releases up to 18.04; however you can't upgrade i386 so that's a plus for amd64.\ni386 however can be  slower to run on some amd64 cpus, so the benefit of more efficient use of memory (smaller word sizes) can be lost due to slower execution in some cases (CPU specific).\nIf you're going to upgrade past 18.04; I'd now use amd64; though given Lubuntu didn't support upgrading 18.04 (last LXDE release); that advantage maybe moot (but is worth something if you're using Xubuntu/Xfce).\nI'd decide by what applications you'll run, will they benefit by having slightly more ram? plus your CPU; does it run amd64 faster than i386 as more modern cpus usually do.  In QA-testing I find various boxes perform differently so my answer can vary on a box (ie. cpu).\nThe wordsize hit 32bit/4byte vs 64bits/8bytes isn't that great, is generally about equal to the performance loss of running the older i386 code vs. more native amd64 on modern cpus.  On older/earlier CPUs though; the i386 generally didn't have the performance hit when compared with amd64 execution unlike more modern cpus.\nThis opinion is based on QA-testing Lubuntu 18.04 -> 19.04 (using i386 or 32-bit) versus the same amd64 I tended to prefer the i386 on low ram boxes, but the difference was minimal/subjectively equal and I found the difference was greatly influenced by the apps you used (some apps performed better in amd64!)\nSubjectively I'd like 2GB for amd64 as a minimum; and it was all I used in QA-testing 19.10 and later (though I did keep a pentium 4 i386 box upgrading until the building of packages for i386 stopped late in the beta cycle of eoan)\n", "Q: Dekko lost my email I wrote an email today in Dekko and then pressed send. The train I was in went through an area where I lost Internet connection, whilst the email was sending. As a result the email didn't go and I got a message saying server could not be found and the only option I had was Close. So I pressed close and the email was lost, with my in-box being displayed. The email I had just written did not go into drafts, it was totally lost.\nIs this a known issue, and is there a workaround for it?\n\nA: This is a known bug, apparently, and is already documented here.\nSupposedly it'll be fixed and such in a later version of Dekko, based on the bug, but it's not got an ETA.\n\nUpdate (May 31, 2016): A fix has been committed for this issue and will be released in the next version of Dekko.\n", "Q: How do I install matplotlib dependencies? How can I easily install all the non-Python dependencies I require before I can pip install matplotlib?\n\nA: This is an easy way to install all non-Python dependencies before doing a pip installation:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install dependencies of the system version – this does not install the system version itself.\nsudo apt-get build-dep python-matplotlib\n\n\n*Enter your virtualenv as usual (you may use a different tool to do this):\npew workon your_virtualenv\n\n\n*Install matplotlib (and all python dependencies like numpy) from pypi:\npip install matplotlib\n\nNote this installs all dependencies (for all matplotlib components, including optional components that you may not use). The benefit is: easy installation, future-proofing. The cost is: download time/bandwidth. This method doesn't account for: brand new dependencies (if pip version > system version and very new dependencies have been introduced) — in this case you'll need to do it the traditional way (find what's breaking and consult documentation/support).\nReferences: http://matplotlib.org/users/installing.html#building-on-linux\n", "Q: Errors configuring mysql 7 after upgrade to ubuntu 16.04 I upgraded to Ubuntu 16.04 and now can not get MySQL 5.7 to work.

When a second postgres is installed, it will check for a running installation, look at it's port, and use the next one.  This allows you to have the two installations running simultaneously, to allow for checking validation before turning off the old one.  You can manually edit the file /etc/postgresql/9.5/main/postgresql.conf and change the port to whatever you want to use.  I don't know what rake does, maybe it has a port in a config file too.  \n\nReconfigure/restart rake to make it use the 5432 port, since it is failing on port 5433.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 16.04 black screen on boot I have just installed Ubuntu 16.04 on my laptop, a Dell Inspiron 3543 (Intel i5 at 2.2 Ghz, 4GB ram, nvidia 820m) and every time i boot it, i get a black screen.

However I cannot straight do apt-get install openssh-server as it fails in resolving many required dependencies. Thanks to my companies super creepy proxy settings. Now I have all Windows machine here and one 64 bit Ubuntu with openssh installed. So I cannot copy paste .deb from this machine to my Ubuntu VM and install as my deb packages will have different architecture (32 bit vs 64 bit). \nSo I went on downloading 32 bit packages from this site (Thank god, my company's IS team has not discovered this website yet!!!). However I dont know what all packages will be required by openssh as its dependencies. I checked my Ubuntu 64 bit machine. By sorting var\\cache\\apt\\archive by date, I realised that on the day when I installed openssh on that machine, following packages were installed:\n\n\n*\n\n*openssh-sftp-server\n\n*openssh-server\n\n*openssh-client\n\n*libck-connector0\n\n\nSo here is what I did:\n\n\n*\n\n*I downloaded debs of 32 bit versions of the above from the site and ran sudo dpkg -i *.deb. It said it requires ssh-import-id package. \n\n*I downloaded ssh-import-id and again run above command again. It said \"ssh-import-id is not configured yet as it requires python-requests\". \n\n*I downloaded that and ran the command. It said \"python-requests is not configured yet as it requires python-urllib3\".\n\n*So I downloaded python-urllib3 and ran the command. This time it said \"libpython2.7-stdlib:i386 (2.7.9-ubuntu3) breaks python-urllib3 (<< 1.9.1-3) and is installed\"\n\n\nI guess I installed wrong versions and also at each step when the installation failed, the some of the packages were installed, some were not and those which were installed are left ill-configured. So each time I ran sudo dpkg -i, I should have uninstalled the packages I installed ealier.\nI feel this is a lot of pain. Also it is very difficult to know and install correct versions of all dependencies. Is there any way by which I can:\n\n\n*\n\n*Capture list of currently installed packages on my VM,\n\n*Upload it on some site,\n\n*Specify what I want to install next and\n\n*in return that website would tell me what all .deb packages I will need\n\n\nI would have downloaded all those manually from above site and then installed them. \nIs there any such way? What other options I am left with?\n\nA: Download and install gdebi.deb for your architecture.\nDownload openssh-server.deb. Right-click on it and choose \"Install with gdebi\" option. Gdebi will tell you about missing dependencies, one-by-one. Download each depending deb package and install them one-by-one using Gdebi.

I have an old PC that I installed Ubuntu 10.04 and Windows XP to dual boot.  I don't remember how I did it, but it works fine.  It seems to me that I had use a different boot disc tool to do it.   I would now like to get rid of the old Ubuntu and install Debian Wheezy. \nIf I boot from the Debian ISO, and choose the partition on which Ubuntu resides, will it overwrite?  And will the boot menu/boot loader automatically update?\nI am paranoid about wiping it out.  I use this PC for a CNC router table. \n\nA: First thing to do, 100%, is to back up your machine using something like CloneZilla. This will create a complete clone of your hard drive, including all boot partitions and stuff. In the long run, you'll likely hugely appreciate doing this, as your CNC router table will continue to function.\nAfter that, sure, you should just be able to boot from the Debian ISO and choose the partition that Ubuntu lives on. You might need to delete some partitioning if bits of it were separated out at installation, in which instance you need to be careful not to delete the Windows boot manager. If you delete the GRUB loader, that's fine, you can replace it and add Windows to it later without any complications.\nAfter that, if anything does go wrong, CloneZilla will come to the rescue and restore the machine to its exact state before the upgrade.\n", "Q: System crashes at logout I'm experiencing an issue with a fresh install of Ubuntu 16.04.

Does it detect the GPU if you manage your drivers in Software & Updates, found in System Settings?\nPersonally I disabled my dGPU in the BIOS on my laptop, since it only gave me troubles both in Windows and in Linux and I rarely use my laptop for anything else than basic office use and virtual labs anyways.\nCheers\n\nA: I managed to fix this problem by blacklisting the kernel module 'amdgpu'.\nOpen /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf and add the following line to the end of the file:\nblacklist amdgpu\n\nIn order for this to take effect, you must update your initrd image by running:\nupdate-initramfs -u\n\nAfter a reboot, you should no longer experience crashing upon logout.\n\nA: I disabled the Intel \"turbo boost\" in the BIOS which \"increases performance\" of the CPU and GPU. This took care of the logout issue.\n", "Q: ignore-depends options passed from apt-get not behaving as expected A package being installed with apt-get has a dependency on java that I want to ignore.\n$ apt-cache depends some-package\nsome-package\n  PreDepends: <java7-runtime-headless>\n    default-jre-headless\n    openjdk-7-jre-headless\n  PreDepends: unzip\n  ...\n\n$ sudo apt-get install some-package -o Dpkg::Options::='--ignore-depends=default-jre-headless,openjdk-7-jre-headless,java7-runtime-headless'\n\nThe following extra packages will be installed:\nca-certificates-java fontconfig-config fonts-dejavu-core java-common\nlibasyncns0 libcups2 libflac8 libfontconfig1 libjpeg-turbo8 libjpeg8\nliblcms2-2 libnspr4 libnss3 libnss3-nssdb libogg0 libpulse0 libsctp1\nlibsndfile1 libvorbis0a libvorbisenc2 lksctp-tools openjdk-7-jre-headless\ntzdata-java\n\nI went with a shotgun approach on the ignore-depends parameter to try cover various packages, but openjdk-7-jre-headless seems to always be pulled in.

compatibility issue with some sd cards (mainly SDHC or SDXC).\nA workaround is below, but the IO speed is about 10x lower :(\nWrite a file called /etc/modprobe.d/sdcard.conf with this content:\noptions sdhci debug_quirks2=0x2\n\nLet's remove and probe some modules:\n sudo rmmod sdhci_acpi sdhci_pci sdhci\n sudo modprobe sdhci; sudo modprobe sdhci_acpi; sudo modprobe sdhci_pci\n\nAfter this, your SD card must be shown at notification bar.\nTo save all this configurations, run:\n sudo update-initramfs -u\n\n\nA: Try this:\nsudo apt install --reinstall udisks2\n\nthen reboot the Linux.\n\nA: I had similar problem when using SDXC 128GB in Ubuntu 18.04 and 19.04. I 'd tried couple times to reinstall but the problem could not be solved. I inspected the format used, it was exfat. Then I reformatted using NTSF, and it is working now. May be you can try my experience.\n\nA: I had this same problem in 19.04.  The recent kernel bump from 5.0.0-13 to -31 (apt update && apt upgrade) fixed it.\n", "Q: Error while running make to install `Sumo` When I tried to install Sumo-0.26.0 I am getting this error while running make command:  \n\n\"../../src/utils/vehicle/IntermodalRouter.h:109:35: error: there are no arguments to ‘fabs’ that depend on a template parameter, so a declaration of ‘fabs’ must be available [-fpermissive]\"\n\n\nA: \nYour post is tagged 15.04, unknown version.

The ls command takes it's arguments on the command line not on standard input (i. e. file descriptor 0).\nWhen you run\n<SOME_COMMAND> | ls [OPTIONS...]\n\nyou instruct the command interpreter to create a pipe (|) from the the standard output of the left command to the standard input of the right command (here: ls). But ls disregards its standard input and inspects its command line parameters, finding no positional argument and listing the current working directory (stored in the PWD environment variable by shell interpreters like Bash) instead.\nThe xargs(1) takes tokens (delimited by whitespace characters if not specified otherwise) from its standard input stream and adds them as parameters to the command line of another command to run. In your case, the ls command given to xargs receives a set of path names on its command line and performs its task on them as documented by the manual.\nBonus: The \"command\" option -ls to GNU find will print the matching paths in a similar fashion to ls -dils (see find(1)).\n\nA: Another solution is to use command substitution.\nSyntax: command options $(output of another command)\nFor this example:\nls -lah $(find . -name *foo*)\n\n", "Q: Problems with second hard drive (not detected until click, and extra win10 loader) I've recently become an Ubuntu convert from windows 10, and i've really loved it so far. It's really far better than windows for development and alot of other things I do regularly. \nHowever, there are 2 problems that I cant seem to be able to solve. I have 2 card drives, a 128GB SSD, and a 1TB HDD. Previously, my windows will be installed on the SSD, and the various programs on the HDD. Initially, I reformatted my SSD, and installed Ubuntu 16.04 on it. Only after installing ubuntu, did i go and reformat the HDD Into NTFS. This has caused some issues.\n1) I followed a few stack overflow guides, that told me i can still install programs on the HDD in ubuntu, just by finding where it's mounted and installing there. its mounted under\n/media/wboy/HDD_NAME\n\nI've installed dropbox, anaconda, and other stuff there, but i realise dropbox throws a \"media directory changed, relink or exit\" something error , and all my symlinks / programs are NOT accessible until i click the harddrive icon in the launcher to view that drive. Then magically the symlinks and stuff will work again. Is there a way to fix this? I dont want to have to click the drive in the launcher every time i restart my computer.\n2) I dont know why whenever on load, it shows me a grub menu, i only have ubuntu installed. BUt the options are: ubuntu, ubuntu advanced options, memtestx86, some other memtest, and windows 10 loader (/dev/sda1). Why do i have a windows 10 loader? i clean installed ubuntu, there shouldnt be a loader! selecting the loader loads a blank screen which goes nowhere. I suspect i screwed up somewhere with LVM, but im not really sure.\nWould appreciate any guidance from the awesome Ubuntu community!\nThank you so much for reading! :)\n\nA: In answer to your first question: You can find out how to auto-mount NTFS partitions on boot here.\n\nA: I wrote an answer for a similar issue you can check it out here. \nThe settings with grub can be changed so it doesn't show the menu at boot time if you choose .. you need to edit the /etc/default/grub file and after you make the changes you need to run sudo update-grub or an easier way is to google Grub Customizer for a graphical interface.\n\nA: *\n\n*Open Disks utility in Ubuntu. \n\n*Go to the hard drive which you want to mount at your desired location.\n\n*Unmount the selected partition.\n\n*Open its settings and select 'Edit Mount Options...'\n\n*Then change the mount point to the location which you get after typing 'pwd' after manually mounting your hard drive.\n\n*Change the 'identify As' field to /dev/disk/by-label/Data (You may have something else but that won't matter much)\n\n*Save and Remount the hard drive and it will start mounting automatically.\n\n", "Q: Gnome2 Keyring displaying Large Green Tick When an application wants to access a stored key or certificate in Gnome 2 Key Storage I get a password box with a green bordered white box with a green tick inside.

I made some bootrepair runs in between and tried to fix MBR, etc - nothing worked.

If it doesn't play the first time you run that command, try running it again as root:  \nsudo aplay /usr/share/sounds/alsa/Front_Center.wav\n\nIf it still doesn't play, that means there is a problem with your configuration.

It said something like \"windows wasn't shut down correctly\".\nI also wanna mention, that I have never used the data drive in windows 10.\nWhat is the Problem? What shall I do?\n\nA: You cant use sleep / hibernate / hybrid sleep with Windows if you want access to a drive that is being used by Windows. \nIf you want access to the drive in Ubuntu ... you will need to do a full shutdown \"Start / Shutdown/ Shutdown my computer\". If you still have issues you will need to disable fast startup located under Power Options then choose what the power buttons do .. then Uncheck the Turn on fast startup (recommended) If all else fails you can try disabling hibernate by going to a admin command prompt and typing powercfg /h off which will also disable fast startup but with ssd's it doesn't matter .. my computer boots in like 18 seconds\n\n\n", "Q: Sync specific folder between two Ubuntu machines when connected to the same LAN I have two Ubuntu machines, a laptop and a desktop.\nWhat I wish to do is, to create a folder in both machines at paths 'path1' and 'path2'.\nI want to set up sync between the two folders whenever they are connected to the same local area network (Desktop through Ethernet and Laptop through WLAN).

[It's ok if deletion sync doesn't work and I have to manually delete a file from both directories simultaneously]\n\nA: [Answering my own question as I found a nice way to do this]\nUse unison tool developed by Benjamin Pierce at U Penn.\nLet us assume you have two directories,\n/home/user/Documents/dirA/ and /home/user/Documents/dirB/\nTo synchronize these two, you may use:\n~$unison -ui text /home/user/Documents/dirA/ /home/user/Documents/dirB/\nIn output, unison will display each and every directory and file that is different in the two directories you have asked to sync. It will recommend to additively synchronize (replicate missing file in both locations) on the initial run, then create and maintain a synchronization tree on your machine, and on subsequent runs it will implement true synchronization (i.e., if you delete a file from .../dirA, it will get deleted from .../dirB as well. You can also compare each and every change and optionally choose to forward or reverse synchronize between the two directories.\nOptionally, to launch graphical interface, simply remove the -ui text option from your command, although I find the cli simpler and faster to use.\nMore on this: Unison tutorial at Unison user documentation.\n\n\n\nA: Check out this tutorial on how to sync folders using rsync.\nCheers\n", "Q: Two instances of grub I tried installing Ubuntu on my laptop several times and finally succeeded(dual boot)\nI need to select ubuntu from boot menu in order to open grub and start ubuntu\nSo that is not my problem\nMy actual problem is:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*i see two ubuntu written on the menu \n  \n*Is this two instances of grub\n  \n*My ubuntu also runs very slow Is it due to this two instances of grub\n  \n\nHow can I remove one of them ?  \nMy Laptop is Hp pavilion g6 2320tx\nIntel core i5 \n4GB RAM\n1 TB hdd\nGraphic processor amd mobility radeon 7670M\n(i have disabled the radeon graphics in linux just to check whether this is causing the laptop getting slow but no change detect , still slow , the radeon graphics is still disabled)\nEDIT 1\nThe result of\nsudo update-grub\n\n\nThe result of \nsudo efibootmgr -v\n\n\n\nA: Your screen shots aren't showing up for me. In general, multiple entries in the EFI's boot menu should not be a problem. In fact, it's common to see two such entries, one pointing to grubx64.efi and the other to shimx64.efi. If this is what you're seeing, it's perfectly normal. I wouldn't worry about this or attempt to \"fix\" it unless you think it's causing a real problem. I say this because mucking with these entries can cause much more serious problems, like a complete failure to boot; it's just not worth it to fix a minor cosmetic issue. That said....\nI recommend you look at the BootOrder item in the efibootmgr -v output. Chances are it's set incorrectly, and setting it to boot one of the ubuntu entries (either one if you're not using Secure Boot, or the one pointing to shimx64.efi if you are) will get the system booting directly into GRUB. You can do this via the -o option to efibootmgr, as in sudo efibootmgr -o 0002,0000,0003 to boot Boot0002 as a first priority, Boot0000 if that fails, and Boot0003 if neither of the preceding options works. You must check your actual efibootmgr -v output to figure out what order to use, of course. Alternatively, you could do this using EasyUEFI in Windows.\nMultiple EFI boot manager entries should not cause speed problems in Ubuntu. I recommend you post a new question about that topic. Chances are you've got a runaway process, too little RAM, or some other problem that's completely unrelated to EFI or GRUB. Typing top in a window will show details that might be helpful, so posting a screen shot of that may be worthwhile -- but please be sure you post the screen shot correctly.\n\nA: This is standard for ubuntu and for that matter most other linux distributions when the kernel is updated the package manager retains one previous version and removes the older ones. This is done for a reason, if there is some issue with the new kernel install it lets you boot the system with the previous known good kernel instead.\nOf course there is no real reason to keep it after you are sure that the newer kernel boots correctly in your case you could use the following command to remove the older 4.4.0-21 kernel installation:\nsudo apt-get remove linux-*-4.4.0-21\n\nThere is really no need to do this however unless you are in the situation where a few tens of megabytes of disk space is critical in which case honestly it's probably advisable to consider investing in a hardware upgrade since a few hundred megabytes is hardly any space and you would constantly be running into the need to remove things as the disk fills up every 5 minutes.\n", "Q: Huawei modem does not work with 16.04 Ubuntu 16.04 does not recognize my Huawei 15ca USB modem.\nHow can I fix this?\n\nA: The instructions on how to fix this are slightly different than 14.04.\nOne of these steps might not be needed, but here is how I got it to work:\nvi /lib/udev/rules.d/40-usb_modeswitch.rules\n\nand add this line:\nATTR{idVendor}==\"12d1\", ATTR{idProduct}==\"15ca\", RUN+=\"usb_modeswitch '%b/%k'\"\n\nThen:\nsudo touch /etc/usb_modeswitch.d/12d1:15ca\n\nRun this command:\nsudo usb_modeswitch -J -v 0x12d1 -p 0x15ca\n\nNow you should see it under available network connections and under lsusb it appears with a different product number:\nBus 003 Device 008: ID 12d1:1506 Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd.

Also remember to add it into edit connection/add mobile broadband connection.\n\nA: I had this problem today. I had 2 computers with Ubuntu 16.04 where the 12d7:1505 modem works well.\nI bought another one and it does not work without the\nsudo usb_modeswitch -v 12d1 -p 1506 -J\n\ncommand.\nI fixed it with another udev rule.\nAdd /etc/udev/rules.d/huawei.rules file with this content:\nACTION==\"add\", SUBSYSTEM==\"usb\", ATTRS{idVendor}==\"12d1\", ATTRS{idProduct}==\"1505\", RUN+=\"/usr/sbin/usb_modeswitch -v 12d1 -p 1506 -J\"\n\nThen reboot, or run sudo udevadm control -R and insert the modem.

The device remains listed as \"mass storage\" in more than half cases. \n:(\nTherefore I had to use a very dirty solution: I added the latter one to root's crontab to run every 10 seconds. I know it's ridiculous, but I cannot think of anything better in these circumstances. The command will work if the device is listed as mass storage (if it is already turned into a modem, it just exits with a message \"No devices in default mode found. Nothing to do. Bye!\" so it does not interfere with a properly working modem. \nThis is stupid, but in case somebody would like to use it, here are my crontab entries: \n* * * * *           /usr/sbin/usb_modeswitch -J -v 0x12d1 -p 0x15ca  > /dev/null 2>&1\n* * * * * sleep 10; /usr/sbin/usb_modeswitch -J -v 0x12d1 -p 0x15ca  > /dev/null 2>&1\n* * * * * sleep 20; /usr/sbin/usb_modeswitch -J -v 0x12d1 -p 0x15ca  > /dev/null 2>&1\n* * * * * sleep 30; /usr/sbin/usb_modeswitch -J -v 0x12d1 -p 0x15ca  > /dev/null 2>&1\n* * * * * sleep 40; /usr/sbin/usb_modeswitch -J -v 0x12d1 -p 0x15ca  > /dev/null 2>&1\n* * * * * sleep 50; /usr/sbin/usb_modeswitch -J -v 0x12d1 -p 0x15ca  > /dev/null 2>&1\n\nThe device starts working after either 10 or 20 seconds (if the command has to be run twice - which is most of the cases). \nI also added this to my /etc/fstab to prevent an attempt to mount the usb mass storage shortly after inserting.

This isn't the way I'd do it, for a number of reasons, but it's surely the easiest way to do the partition changes you want.\nOtherwise, you're going to have problems.  Deleting the first (or first two or three) partitions on the hard disk and expanding the remaining one(s) to fill the space is going to cause problems with partition ordering; you may get away with it if you (or your installer) used UUID for all your GRUB and fstab designations, but the first partition or two are almost certainly primary partitions, and my experience is that only logical volumes located inside an extended partition can be readily relocated or expanded.\nOne reasonably practical way to do this, however, might be to delete the Windows partition(s) (using a partitioning tool from inside Ubuntu or Ubuntu Live), create new partition(s), and clone the Ubuntu partition into the new partition(s).  You'll need to correct the UUIDs in GRUB and fstab, but this will get Ubuntu into the primary partition(s) and let you do what you like with the rest of the hard disk space.\nIt should go without saying, that you should make a backup of anything you want to keep before attempting this...\n", "Q: Unstable WiFi on Ubuntu14.04.4 LTS (dual booted with windows7) I dual booted my PC with Ubuntu 14.04.4(trusty), with Windows7 installed first.

When you are not getting a good connection there are 4 other Access Points contending for that channel.\nChoose a better channel.

If you don't need a bluetooth mouse changing to a wired mouse may well be the simplest solution.\nUpdating to the latest version of the firmware apparently solves this. You can download the latest firmware from  Intel's Linux driver support page. Make sure you install the firmware for the correct chip and kernel version.

In my case KDE had the resolution set in ~/.local/share/kscreen/*\nYou can confirm that its stored in a local config by creating and logging in with a new user. After that just set the screen resolution to some obscure width/height and grep for those numbers under ~/ to find where the config is hiding\n", "Q: Why does overwriting tty1.conf with rc.local cause a \"Host SMBus controller not enabled!\" hang during boot?

How does changing the tty1.conf during boot, or changing one line in the tty1.conf have anything to do with the Host SMBus controller?\nAlso, anyone know of an easier way to make a user logon automatically during boot? Caveat: this happens during the first boot ever, there can be NO hands on keyboard. Whatever the solution is must fit into the first-boot-config.sh script. I can place any file onto the filesystem via a custom deb package so it will be on the file system when the install is done, but not /etc/tty1.conf specifically because it's already a part of another package (upstart).\nUpdate: I also get this error when using Virtualbox (instead of VMWare). The Virtualbox error reads:\nUpdate 2: If I restart the VM after the error appears and stops the boot... the next boot works as expected, auto logging in the \"interface\" user and kicking of it's subsequent custom shell!!

First I determined that the charset on the old VFAT drive was ISO-8859-1 (very common for Windows). I then executed a rsync command with the option to convert the old charset to UTF-8 and that did the trick.\nExample:\nrsync -vaW --size-only --iconv=ISO-8859-1,utf-8 /media/Music/* '/media/username/Seagate Backup Plus Drive/Backup - Music/Music' > ~/rsynclog.txt\n\nHope that helps somebody else!\n\nA: If the problem is specific to your system (e.g. copy of file with special caracters in their names works in Windows or on other GNU/Linux distribution) you may want to add the option iocharset=utf8 at the end of your mount command. That solved the problem for me.\n", "Q: Can't open ODT large file in 16.04 after upgrade from 15.10 I have a large ODT file (37.3 MB) file which I can no longer open after upgrading from Ubuntu 15.10 to 16.04.

All other mouse-features work, but the slowness issue renders the touchpad nigh unusable.

I've used the Mac Bootable USB Loader to make it Mac bootable, which works. I've attempted to follow the directions here to create a casper-rw partition in GParted using a second Ubuntu USB. \nWhen I boot my USB, I have only 1.9gb available, not the 100+ I should have. If I open GParted, I have only 1 partition, exactly as if I hadn't even created the casper-rw partition in the first place.\nThe directions are very easy to follow. I did get a warning about using FAT32 instead of FAT16 (something about having to reinstall the boot loader if I was using Windows), but I don't think that is the issue.\nWhy isn't my drive partitioning properly? Do these instructions just not work for Mac-bootable USBs?\n\nA: My issue occurred due to a bug in the version of GParted included with Ubuntu 14.04, which I has been using to edit my partitions. Basically, it crashed when I tried to resize a FAT32 partition. To solve this, I remade my secondary live USB with Ubuntu 12.04 to use a non-broken version of GParted.\n(Because I ran in to unrelated issues later, I ended up following these instructions, with some tweaking.)\n", "Q: How can i delete Ubuntu from the computer?

Any OS you like. During the install process it will probably ask you where you want it installed. Choose erase ENTIRE disk and install. After erasing entire disk, it will probably ask you for a new partition. Create a new partition any way you see fit and install OS to it.

Since this file is installed by the libnm-gtk0 package you could try the following command to reinstall it in case it is corrupted.\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall libnm-gtk0\n\nThe other likely candidate for this error would be if you have somehow installed amd64 packages on a 32 bit (i386) version of ubuntu since the 32 bit kernel will not recognise the ELF64 (64 bit binary) as being a valid ELF header which would produce this error also perhaps if the above doesn't fix the problem you should add the output of the following command to your question:\nuname -a\n\nThat will print out some information about your kernel and platform that could help diagnose the issue further.\n", "Q: Banshee doesn't respond to the multimedia keys after upgrade from 15.10 to 16.04 Rhythmbox does respond to the keys, but it is the only one.

If you go to boot-order, or something like that, and push the GRUB boot manager to the highest priority. It should boot to GRUB first after that.

Or do I have to give the partition back to Windows, then re-partition it for Ubuntu, and then install Ubuntu in the re-created unallocated disk space?\nThanks!\n\nA: Yes, it's quite possible.  Boot from a live USB and do a Something Else install.  Mark the partitions you already have used for Lubuntu to be used for Ubuntu : if you did a default install, you probably just have a system partition and a swap partition.  Mark the system partition to be used, mounted at /, and formatted.  \n", "Q: Set bash as default shell with option to enter into fish I've seen a few questions as to how to enter into bash while fish is the default shell.

However, I do not want to uninstall fish and would like the option to enter into a shell session with fish at my discretion. Any advice on how to do this?\n\nA: You could change your default shell to bash by typing in the following line:\nchsh -s /bin/bash\n\nYou will probably need to log out and log back in for the settings to take effect.\nThen if you wanted to run fish, it would just be the command fish at a bash prompt.\nMore information can be found at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ChangingShells\n", "Q: Juju bootstrap Error \"no matching tools available\" System specification: Ubuntu 15.10, maas 1.25\njuju bootstrap returns following error:\nINFO juju.environs.bootstrap tools.go:77 looking for bootstrap tools: version=<nil>\nERROR juju.cmd supercommand.go:429 failed to bootstrap environment: no matching tools available\n\nHere is \" dpkg -l | grep juju\" :\nii  juju                                                 1.25.5-    ubuntu1~15.10.2~juju1              all          next generation service orchestration system\nii  juju-core                                            1.25.5-0ubuntu1~15.10.2~juju1              amd64        Juju is devops distilled - client\nii  juju-quickstart                                      2.2.4+bzr147+ppa42~ubuntu15.10.1           all          Easy configuration of Juju environments\nii  python-jujubundlelib                                 0.4.1-1~ubuntu15.10.1~ppa1                 all          A Python2 library for working with Juju bundles.\nii  python-jujuclient                                    0.50.3-1~ubuntu15.10.1~ppa1                amd64        Python API client for juju-c\n\nHere is the result of \"juju bootstrap --upload-tools --debug\"\n\n2016-05-25 20:53:33 INFO juju.cmd supercommand.go:37 running juju [1.25.5-wily-amd64 gc]\n2016-05-25 20:53:33 WARNING juju.environs config.go:168 Config attribute \"tools-metadata-url\" (https://streams.canonical.com/juju/tools/streams/v1/index2.sjson) is deprecated.\nIt is replaced by \"agent-metadata-url\" attribute.\nYour configuration should be updated to set \"agent-metadata-url\" as follows\nagent-metadata-url:   https://streams.canonical.com/juju/tools/streams/v1/index2.sjson.\n2016-05-25 20:53:33 WARNING juju.environs config.go:168 Config attribute \"tools-metadata-url\"    (https://streams.canonical.com/juju/tools/streams/v1/index2.sjson) is deprecated.\nIt is replaced by \"agent-metadata-url\" attribute.\nYour configuration should be updated to set \"agent-metadata-url\" as follows\nagent-metadata-url: https://streams.canonical.com/juju/tools/streams/v1/index2.sjson.\n2016-05-25 20:53:33 DEBUG juju.provider.maas environprovider.go:28 opening environment \"maas\".\n2016-05-25 20:53:33 WARNING juju.environs.config config.go:1430 unknown config field \"metadata-source\"\n2016-05-25 20:53:33 WARNING juju.environs.config config.go:1430 unknown config field \"metadata-source\"\n2016-05-25 20:53:34 DEBUG juju.environs.configstore disk.go:351 writing jenv file\n2016-05-25 20:53:34 DEBUG juju.environs.configstore disk.go:475 writing jenv file to /home/rastin/.juju/environments/maas.jenv\n2016-05-25 20:53:34 INFO juju.network network.go:242 setting prefer-ipv6 to false\n2016-05-25 20:53:34 INFO juju.cmd cmd.go:129 Bootstrapping environment \"maas\"\n2016-05-25 20:53:34 DEBUG juju.environs.bootstrap bootstrap.go:103 environment \"maas\" supports service/machine networks: true\n2016-05-25 20:53:34 DEBUG juju.environs.bootstrap bootstrap.go:105 network management by juju enabled: true\n2016-05-25 20:53:34 WARNING juju.environs.config config.go:1430 unknown config field \"metadata-source\"\n2016-05-25 20:53:34 WARNING juju.environs.config config.go:1430 unknown config field \"metadata-source\"\n2016-05-25 20:53:34 INFO juju.cmd cmd.go:129 Starting new instance for initial state server\n2016-05-25 20:53:34 INFO juju.provider.maas environ.go:137 address allocation feature disabled;

If fails then try opening it from launcher instead of terminal.\n\nA: This is a known issue.\nAs a workaround that does not require reinstalling unetbootin, you can run this command:  \nsudo QT_X11_NO_MITSHM=1 unetbootin\n\nWhat the above command does is disable shared memory access for running this Qt based application, allowing it to work properly on GNOME.\nThe PPA source for unetbootin in the accepted answer includes the prefix to disable shared memory access in the default run command so that launching it from the GUI shortcut just works without any hassle: https://launchpad.net/~gezakovacs/+archive/ubuntu/ppa\nSource of answer:\nhttps://github.com/unetbootin/unetbootin/issues/67\n\nA: I changed the Exec property in unetbootin.desktop: \n\nExec=/usr/bin/xdg-su -c /usr/bin/unetbootin\n\nand created file /usr/bin/unetbootin with the bash script: \n\n#!/bin/bash\n  QT_X11_NO_MITSHM=1 /usr/sbin/unetbootin\n\nthen made it exetutable: \n\nsudo chmod +x /usr/sbin/unetbootin\n\nand now when I run Unetbootin from my application overview it launches normally with GUI.\n\nA: Since Ubuntu 17.10  wayland is the default x server, the program that manages access to the graphic devices drivers, xhosts allows users to connect to those drivers.\nSince sudo doesn't have an active session nor it's allow to access the server, unetbootin cannot create an instance of it's GUI.\nOnce you run that you give sudo access to the device drivers and hence allow unetbootin (since it's running as sudo) to create a window with nthose steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Under user run\nxhost local:root\n\nnon-network local connections being added to access control list\n\n*Then with sudo\nsudo QT_X11_NO_MITSHM=1 /usr/bin/unetbootin \n\nSource: https://github.com/unetbootin/unetbootin/issues/94\nSo you can add an alias to your ~/.bashrc file:\n alias unetbootin=\"xhost local:root && sudo QT_X11_NO_MITSHM=1 unetbootin\"\n\n\nA: Tried the accepted answer above but still had blank screen on Ubuntu 18.04\nWhat I discovered: As part of the messages in terminal from sudo apt-get install unetbootin I saw the following:\nReading package lists... \nSuggested packages:\n  p7zip-rar\nRecommended packages:\n  gksu | kdesudo\n\nMy solution: Install gksu\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:belin/stable\nsudo apt install gksu\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt upgrade\n\nVouila: Fully functioning UNetbootin screen & app\n\nWarning?: I don't know if I understand all the ramifications of installing gksu.

Do I need to uninstall Intel's onboard graphics? How do I do that? And if I do install the drivers, will the 15.04 driver work for my 16.04 LTS system?\n\nA: By default a PCI-E graphics card will be used in preference to an onboard one, older AGP systems sometimes needed this to be manually set in the BIOS but not on newer hardware.\nIf it is reporting the card in use as the AMD then it is already being used it will be using the open source radeon driver. The AMD proprietary drivers will not work since AMD proprietary drivers have not been updated to support the newer Xorg 1.18.\nAs for lspci it simply lists devices in the order of their PCI ID numbers so the ordering of that list has nothing to do with which devices are in use or how.

But, it requested half my drive 449 Gig (half a terabyte).  Installing 16.0.4\nHow many Gig for Ubuntu itself?\n\nA: At Canonical's website, they recommend at least 25GB, but it all depends of your intended usage. For general usage, 50GB is more than enough. \n", "Q: Ubuntu 16.04/Win 10 Dual Boot install: Cannot reduce partition below 50% in Windows, Ubuntu does not detect drive first timer here. Checked the documentation, don't see a solution. I'm a casual *nix user but I can follow your commands. \n--\nI am having trouble installing for a dual-boot Windows 10 and Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. The Live USB works perfectly (no flicker, wi-fi out of the box, scales the QHD beautifully). I'm sold. But, Ubuntu can't see the SSD during installation? gparted also doesn't detect it. Tried the Windows partition to free up space, didn't detect that either.\nIdeally it will dual boot with Windows - probably on a fresh install since windows insists on taking 50% of the 500GB drive for it's own partition system (any thoughts? same issue?). Can't even get Windows to reinstall itself with a format option.. only these newfangled \"reinstall\" options.\nSystem is a Dell XPS 9350. \nThank you!\n\nA: According this page http://en.community.dell.com/techcenter/os-applications/f/4613/t/19679184, you have to change the IRST(Intel Rapid Storage Technology) mode to \"AHCI mode\" in your BIOS. With this mode, the SSD driver should be visible.\n\nA: The answer to this scenario was to (sorry #'d steps causes spam error?): \n\n\n*\n\n*Reset BIOS from AHCI problem by disconnecting battery as @oldfred mentioned. Search \"dell 9350 service manual\" -can't post link due to low rep :() ; note that there are clips attaching the case, and also the screw in the middle by service tag. Disconnect both CMOS and main battery, then power cycle. This resets bios. \n\n\nSEGWAY - use Windows to download windows 10 USB installer via (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10ISO). A RECOVERY USB will not work in my experience - it will only reinstall windows without letting you determine partition size! \nGo to Dell's site and d/l the wireless drivers. They won't come with the new windows install. http://www.dell.com/support/home/us/en/19/product-support/product/xps-13-9350-laptop/drivers \n\n\n*\n\n*Turn off secure boot, and switch to AHCI in BIOS settings (this is via f12 during boot on my 9350 system). I don't know why the secure boot is an issue (as it's supposed to work), but it is, for me at least.\n\n*Boot live usb, run gparted, destroy main windows partition (Keep in mind this is only necessary if you desire a hard drive setup that is less than 50% windows - windows itself will not let you resize the partition to less than this in my experience).\n\n*Shut down, then insert your aforementioned windows 10 install media, install new windows, which will let you pick your partition size (tho' this may work without step using ubuntu to destroy the original, this is how I did it). I picked 70GB, since I am keeping it only to update bios or for emergencies (VM otherwise is better, I think). Stated minimum is 20GB, but already I am seeing 21GB taken by the system, so keep that in mind. \n\n*Finish install, then use those dell drivers I mentioned to get your wireless back. Run all your updates, set it up as you want, yak yak yak. \n\n*Shut down, go back to live Ubuntu USB, and install Ubuntu in remaining space (~375GB on this system)! \n\n*You'll likely want to scale the display for QHD, do this in display settings (hit windows key, type display). \n\n*Enjoy your clean ubuntu/windows 10 dual boot on the dell 9350! So far I have no significant odd issues on 16.04 LTS - the touch seems to not work when coming from suspend (I think), but that's for another post. Everything else is great - go for it!\nThanks for all the help AskUbuntuers! \n", "Q: pinging from GNS3 router to Ubuntu bridged network and vice versa I have installed Vmware on Ubuntu Server and created multiple VMs and connect them to different VMnet adapters. Actually I created 30 VMnet on the server. So I have the physical network adapter in adition to all of those VM network adapters.\nI connect my physical adapter to my laptop which has Windows7 and I share my wireless internet connection to my physical NIC which is connected to the p NIC on the server.\nI installed GNS3 and add a router with 2 interfaces, the first one is bridged to the physical interface and it could get an IP address and connect to internet.\nthe second interface is configured with a different network.\nI can ping both networks from into the router, and I could ping the first interface on the router that facing the internet from my laptop (Windows7) but I could not ping the ip configured on the second interface which is on a different network. \nwhen I tried to ping both interfaces on the router from into Ubuntu server, there is no connection, how come and vice versa, although I disabled the firewall on Ubuntu. But I could ping windows (my laptop) IP address from into the router.\nhow can I make my GNS3 router ping to my bridged NIC ip address on Ubuntu server and vice versa?\n\nA: On Linux / Unix / OS X, when you bridge a router or switch interface to your local Ubuntu host you can’t ping it from your host. But this works on Windows? What gives?\nThis does generally work on Windows (depending on your network card) but not on Linux / Unix. Most likely this is due to differences between libpcap and Winpcap, and the differences in the network stacks on Unix / Windows (e.g. NDIS). However you should be able to ping your bridged interfaces from other systems on the bridged network. If this does not work on Windows for your particular NIC, try creating a Windows loopback adapter and bridging to that. On Linux you can use a tap interface and the NIO_tap (available from a cloud). OS X you can install tun/tap drivers.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 16.04 LXD Openstack Network I have installed Ubuntu 16.04 on 4 Nodes, Installed Openstack Mitaka, one node as compute, running nova-lxd.\nAfter installation, I can login to the dashboard, create a new instance, using LXD as the hypervisor / container, and startup the instance, no problems. Neutron is running on the compute node as well.\nOnce the instance is started, it gets a private IP on the dashboard, as configured by Openstack, but \"lxc list\" shows no ip address.

Do I need any specific change to the neutron configuration files / ml2 ini files ?\nAppreciate your help,\nD,\n\nA: Try to configure lxdbr0 by \ndpkg-reconfigure -p medium lxd\nMaybe it's because lxdbr0 is not configured yet.\nLet me know if it works for you.\n", "Q: Multibooting different distros As in this post (https://www.linux.com/answers/how-can-i-dual-boot-two-or-more-linux-distros) I would like to multiboot linux ! I am on a Dell Vostro 3550 laptop with 1tb HDD, I am not a complete noob at installing linux and the main question I had was that someone in the post linked above said that the last distro that we install is going to be the main/default one.\n\n\n*\n\n*Does that mean that the boot loader of the last one should be installed on the hard drive (in installer: Something Else -> Device for Boot Loader Installation (/dev/sdx)) ?\n\n*Is it okay if I have already installed Ubu's boot loader on my HDD (/dev/sda, in my case) and then, I can install the other systems boot loaders on their own partitions ? e.g. I make a partition for Arch and then the device for boot loader installation is /dev/sda5 (which is Arch's EXT4 partition) ?\nThank you,\nJs\n\nA: Ok, so I figured it out.\nWithout talking about Arch (because of its numerous options), it was fairly simple.\nI first installed Ubuntu and in Ubuquity (its installer) I pre-partitioned my hard drive for the other distros. I then installed each distro and finally, at the complete end, re-installed Ubuntu. I chose my hard drive as the device for the Bootloader's installation (/dev/sdx), and installed as normal.\nNow, when I boot my computer, it goes this way: Ubu's bootloader --> choose the distro. If it's Ubu, then boot into Ubu. If it's something else, then boot into that 'something else'.\nHope it helps !\nNote: I answered my own question for further information if people run into my post and seek help :)\n", "Q: Choosing what partition to install ubuntu From my experience with installing Ubuntu, I have never been able to physically choose which partition the OS is installed on. As long as I had an unallocated partition, it did the job. However, I want to install Ubuntu on a currently occupied partition. So in order to overwrite this partition with Ubuntu, how can I select which partition Ubuntu gets installed on? \nThanks!\n\nA: Everything you need is in the Something else option when you reach the partitioning menu during the installation process.  In there you can select the existing partition you want to use, erase the current contents and instruct the installer to mount it as root partition.\nThis is not the only thing you need to do though since you probably need to create a swap partition too and select a place to install grub.  If you are not familiar with these tasks, this may help you.\nBackup all your data before you start this process since there is a great chance you might make unrecoverable mistakes.

To simply copy all the files not named *.data you could use this:\nfind . -type f ! -name '*.data' | xargs cp -t ../destination_dir/\n\nOn the other hand if you want to preserve the directory structure you could use something like this:\nfor file in `find . ! -name '*.txt' | sed 's/^.\\///'`; do if [ -d \"./$file\" ]; then mkdir -p \"../destination_dir/$file\"; else cp \"./$file\" \"../destination_dir/$file\"; fi; done\n\nNot sure if there is a simpler way to do this but this command does the following:\nFind all files and folders in the current directory or it's subfolders not matching *.data then for each:\nTest if the file is a directory if it is make a matching directory under destination dir, or if it is a file it copies it to the destination instead.\nEdit: Adding shell script version:\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Disable shell glob expansion within the script\n# Required to stop bash from expndinging the glob in $1\nset -f\n\nfor file in `find . ! -name $1 | sed 's/^.\\///'`\n  do if [ -d \"./$file\" ]; then\n    mkdir -p \"$2/$file\"\n  else\n    cp \"./$file\" \"$2/$file\"\nfi\ndone\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu 16.04 media codes missing I recently did a fresh install when going from Ubuntu 15.10 to 16.04.

During installation I selected to install restricted extras (or whatever it's called during setup).  Whenever I go to play practically any video type I get the \"searching for plugins\" prompt followed by \"required plugin could not be found\".  This is for fairly standard video types that I definitely could play before (and can in Windows, other linux distros, etc).  Rhythmbox can't play any of my music (mostly .mp3s).  I tried installing VLC, and that plays without a hitch.  Somehow I think my codecs have gotten screwed up.  I'm fairly settled in to this install and don't really want to go through the reinstall again, so I'd like to get this sorted out.  Initially I hadn't made any package changes that really would have affected codecs.  In attempts to troubleshoot the issue I've tried manually installing/uninstalling/repairing various related packages.\nOn a hunch, I just tried logging in as a different user.  It was able to play the same videos without issue, so I'm pretty sure it's a profile setting.  What folder should I take a look at (or try to rename/delete)?  Some other setting I should look at?\n\nA: Just in case someone else has this problem, I'll go ahead and post my solution. After discovering it was profile specific, I set off to try to find relevant config settings. The solution for me was to remove/rename the ~/.cache/gstreamer-1.0 folder. I did rename a few others, but I'm fairly certain this was the fix. \n", "Q: \"bash: ./cents: no such file exist or directory\" while trying to run a program that has already been compiled Can someone explain to me why this happens? It compiles the program fine but it wont let me run it. I'm on ubuntu 16.04\nBonus question: \nHow can I run the math library on Geany? I love the interface but can't figure out how to to run math.h header file. \nHere's the code:\n\n\nA: Firstly using the gcc switch -c you are telling the compiler to only compile and not link which doesn't produce an executable binary to get an executable binary you need to not use this switch. The correct command would be:\ngcc cents.c\n\nHowever since this command does not specify the output file name the default name a.out will be used for the binary so you probably want to use this command:\ngcc cents.c -o cents\n\nWhich will produce an executable binary called cents which can then be executed with\n./cents\n\nAs for your other question you don't run header files that is not their purpose, header files are source code files the same as .c except their job is to be processed by the c preprocessor. Generally they are used to contain function prototypes for libraries to ensure that the same definitions are used throughout the project even if later the function requires a change to the prototype this helps to minimise errors and resulting bugs when changes are made in the program since the risk of someone missing a source file when changing the definition is otherwise high in large projects.\n", "Q: Unable to Connect to Internet, make Command Not Found, and cannot install my drivers Ubuntu 16.04 xenial - Minimal server - fresh install from USB - Eee PC Asus 1005PEB\nI can't get online.\nI think I need drivers because:\n\n\n*\n\n*ifconfig shows inet addr:127.0.0.1\n\n*All pings result in: connect: Network is unreachable\n\n*sudo service network-manager restart results in: Failed to restart network-manager.service: Unit network-manager.service not found.\nI have an Atheros AR9285 wireless card and found a stable-release package with the assistance of this forum post.

It's my understanding that pdfimages -all extracts images from PDFs in their native formats.\nTherefore, I expected that the JPG (lossy) images extracted from that command would have the same pixel information as the .ppm and .pbm files produced without the -all option, as well as the  PNG (lossless) files created when I right-click and save the image in Evince.\nHowever, my use of the ImageMagick compare command tells me that there are differences in the images contained within the JPG files compared to the other options above.\nTo reproduce, download the PDF in this link (https://fccid.io/document.php?id=2149405), use it as an argument for pdfimages and pdfimages -all and use the first .ppm file and the first .jpg file as arguments for compare.  When I do this, it produces an image file containing red to indicate a difference in the images.\nIs there something that I don't understand?  Is pdfimages adding pixel information by default when it creates .ppm and .pbm files?\n\nA: pdfimages -all returns the exact file that was stored in the pdf.\nWe can test this by doing a round-trip: starting with a jpg image, we add it to a pdf using LaTeX, extract it using pdfimages -all, and then compare it to the original.  (The reason for using LaTeX will be explained later.)\nI have the first jpg image as extracted from your link and I named it device.jpg.  Let's put it in a PDF file using LaTeX:\n$ cat img.tex \n\\documentclass{article}\n\\usepackage{graphicx}\n\\begin{document}\n\\includegraphics[width=5in,keepaspectratio]{device}\n\\end{document}\n$ pdflatex img\n[...snip...]\nOutput written on img.pdf (1 page, 672455 bytes).\nTranscript written on img.log.\n\nNow, let's extract it using pdfimages -all and compare it with the original:\n$ pdfimages -all img.pdf img-all\n$ cmp device.jpg img-all-000.jpg \n$\n\nThe extracted jpg is byte-for-byte identical to the original.\nFootnote: the reason for using LaTeX\nThe above test cannot be done using just any PDF creator.  This is because not all PDF creators will put images into a PDF unmolested.  For example, let's try ImageMagick's convert:\n$ convert device.jpg device.pdf\n$ pdfimages -all device.pdf device-all\n$ cmp device.jpg device-all-000.jpg \ndevice.jpg device-all-000.jpg differ: byte 4, line 1\n\nconvert re-sampled the image to a smaller size before placing it in the pdf.  \n$ ls -1s device.jpg device-all-000.jpg \n528 device-all-000.jpg\n656 device.jpg\n\nImage accuracy was part of pdflatex's design goals.  Other PDF creation software may, by default, \"optimize\" images before placing them in the PDF.\nUpdate: ShreevatsaR points out that the img2pdf utility also provides a lossless method to convert images to PDF.  Non-TeX users will also likely find it much simpler to use.\n", "Q: How can I automatically try a specific resolution if I connect an (any) external monitor?

I installed Xubuntu 16.04 in dual boot with Windows 10 without problems. I have a problem ( sorry for the repetition ) regarding the management of dedicated Nvidia video card and integrated Intel card. I installed the proprietary Nvidia and Intel drivers and I set the Intel one to improve the autonomy of the pc. The system works perfectly, only when I turn it off or reboot it freezes in a black screen with a white dash in the top left corner, forcing me to force it to close. If I use the Nvidia card this does not happen ( the computer turns off and restarts normally) . Someone has the same problem or know a possible solution? \n\nA: Does this happen at all when you disable the option to save your session upon Shutdown? Maybe play around with the hibernation/sleep options a little. It sounds like it might be linked to this particular problem.\n\nA: I used to have the same problem with my MSIGE62VR, the fix was to add:\nacpi_osi=! acpi_osi=\"Windows 2009\"\n\nin the kernel parameters.\nYou can find more details here\n", "Q: Eclipse using high CPU after upgrade to Ubuntu 16.04 I recently upgraded one of my systems to 16.04 and one of the many things that stopped working properly is the Eclipse IDE.

I found a forum post that simply suggested to install ubuntustudio-audio and other application packages, but I do not think this includes any of the enhanced settings present in Ubuntu Studio. \nAny help would be thoroughly appreciated.\n\nA: You can install Ubuntu Studio packages manually or with synaptic package manager. Official instructions are here:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuStudioPreparation\nI recommend you to install Synaptic Package Manager (from \"software\" aplication on system category in the ubuntu menu), and search there ALL \"ubuntustudio\" packages, mark them for installation, and apply changes.

Keep in mind that you'll need a speedy and fairly sized USB drive in order to get a pleasant experience.\nCheers\n\nA: See Difference between LiveCD, LiveUSB, full-install, and persistence? for comparison between Live Persistent and Full installs.\nMkusb makes a persistent install that pretty much closes the gap between Live and Persistent installs, the persistent boot takes a little longer and installing proprietary drivers is still not possible.\nA mkusb drive can be used to install Ubuntu.\n", "Q: Set up a serial port with VirtualBox on Ubuntu (guest OS : Windows XP) I'm having trouble for a few weeks now trying to access the serial port of my computer when working on the guest OS Windows XP Pro via VirtualBox.

I have an external USB drive that I currently have Windows 10 installed on. I used the tool WinToUSB to install Windows 10 on that drive. Windows runs directly from the drive.

(Windows 10 and Lubuntu 16.04.)\nI prefer a real installation of Lubuntu rather than a persistent. This is because a 4GB persistent image is not enough space for my needs.\nHow can I achieve this?\n\nA: From what i understand you don't want software like MultiBootUSB, YUMI or MultiSystem. You already installed WindowsToGo, all you need to do is create linux partition after Windows partition and install Lubuntu to it just like you would install it to any other hard-disk. Your USB drive will be probably listed as sdb, sdc, etc. Make sure you don't mistake it for hda or sda, that being the internal hard-disk of your PC. And make sure GRUB (LUbuntu's bootloader) will install to /sdb (the root of your USB drive), otherwise Lubuntu will remain installed but unavailable.\n", "Q: dropbox issue on Xenial I installed Xubuntu 16.04 one month ago.

Just check it with the command:  \nps -ef | grep -P \"dnsmasq\\s\"\n\nI get this kind of result (notice the --conf-dir parameter):\nnobody    6105  5868  0 20:20 ?        00:00:00 /usr/sbin/dnsmasq --no-resolv --keep-in-foreground --no-hosts --bind-interfaces --pid-file=/run/NetworkManager/dnsmasq.pid --listen-address=127.0.1.1 --cache-size=0 --clear-on-reload --conf-file=/dev/null --proxy-dnssec --enable-dbus=org.freedesktop.NetworkManager.dnsmasq --conf-dir=/etc/NetworkManager/dnsmasq.d\n\nSo you could just create a file e.g. /etc/NetworkManager/dnsmasq.d/my-hosts containing the declaration:\naddn-hosts=/etc/hosts\n\nin order to use /etc/hosts (see doc).\nBut because dnsmasq starts also with --no-hosts this might determine dnsmasq to still ignore /etc/hosts so you could just create a hard link to it e.g.:\nsudo cp -al /etc/hosts /etc/my-hosts\n\nthen change the declaration to:\naddn-hosts=/etc/my-hosts\n\n", "Q: Uninstall MySQL from Ubuntu 16.04 I am trying to uninstall MySQL completely from Ubuntu 16.04 LTS,but I am facing an issue saying: \n\nThe following packages have unmet dependencies:\n  mariadb-client-10.0 : Depends: libdbd-mysql-perl (>= 1.2202) but it is not going to be installed\n  mariadb-client-core-10.0 : Depends: mariadb-common (>= 10.0.24-7) but it is not going to be installed\n  E: Error, pkgProblemResolver::Resolve generated breaks, this may be caused by held packages.  \n\nI tried also to uninstall Mariadb but I have always the same problem. \nAny idea !! \n\nA: I finally uninstall MySQL completely, and reinstall it using these lines :\nRemove all files related to MySQL\nsudo apt-get purge mysql*\n\nsudo apt-get autoremove\n\nsudo apt-get autoclean\n\nThen upgrade my distribution\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\nThen install MySQL \nsudo apt-get install mysql-server\n\nThat's all.\n\nA: As Tico pointed out, if you installed dbconfig-mysql uninstall that first\nThis worked for me\nsudo apt-get remove dbconfig-mysql\n\nafter that I could continue with removing mysql-client and mysql-server\n", "Q: Why is Ubuntu 16.04 so slow to boot on my Dell Inspiron 6000?

When the screen goes to sleep for power saving, Pulseaudio switches the output to the internal sound (laptop speakers/mini jack), and when I wake the screen (by interacting with Kodi, the media center software) the audio remains output to internal sound, so I don't get audio on the TV to which the media center PC is connected.

I have tried to find a solution, but haven't been successful on my own. \nI would highly profit of this remapping since I often use the `-key (I like vim) and never use this other additional key. \n\nA: Go to the folder /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/.\nEdit the gb file and replace the following line:\nkey <LSGT>  { [ backslash,        bar,          bar,    brokenbar ] };\n\nwith:\nkey <LSGT>  { [ backslash,        grave,          bar,    brokenbar ]   };\n\nSave and exit and then execute:\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure xkb-data\n\nLog out and back in and the broken bar will have remapped to the grave character (which I believe is what you're after).\nIf you keep with the US keyboard layout then edit the pc file instead of the gb file and amend the line at the top of the file:\nkey <LSGT> {    [ less, greater, bar, brokenbar ] };\n\nwith this if you want to use shift:\nkey <LSGT> {    [ less, grave, bar, brokenbar ] };\n\nor this if you do not want to use shift:\nkey <LSGT> {    [ grave, greater, bar, brokenbar ] };\n\nand follow the rest of the process as above. The change will be permanent so if you want to change it back you will need to reverse the change by re-editing the file back to the original.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 16.04: where to set Xim server name?

I'm using Ubuntu 15.10 and want to connect to a VPN. I type this in the command line:\nsudo openconnect --juniper vpn.unipi.it\n\nI give it all the needed information and at the end of process, terminal says:\nESP session established with server\n\nThat is, I think, it suceeded in connecting to the VPN. \nThe problem now is that browser and application continue to use my wi-fi connection (I know it because my IP address doesn't change) but I need the VPN one to do my work...\nIs it possible I have to configure a VPN connection with network manager? How should I do?\n\nA: If this is a cisco vpn you need vpnc. Simply installing vpnc gives you the client, which can be connected using terminal. If you want to integrate it with network manager you need the network-manager-vpnc package. \nThis link explains the installation and set up of vpnc\nCISCO VPN configuration steps\n\nA: You VPN connection works, but your IP won't change. \n(That's the \"V\" in VPN : Virtual...)\nThe message states that the VPN Tunnel is open and working, but perhaps your routes are not set correctly so the VPN is not used for the Servers you are using?\nUsually the VPN Server sends a list of routes to your client which tells your client which servers are in the VPN. If that's missing perhaps there are some more settings for your VPN that needs to be passed to your openconnect call?\nCan you ask an admin of the vpn if there is some config for openconnect available?\n", "Q: Can't change display resolution : nVidia GT610 I was using Win7. But on Ubuntu 16.04 I get bad performance in every single game, no matter how old it is. So I thought I could add a lower custom resolution to improve the performance.

I'm sure there is a way to run an older Kernel, however, it will likely break 16.04 since it relies on the newer Kernel functions.\nA list of Ubuntu and Kernel OS/Kernel compatibilities can be found here\nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/Support\n\nA: For 14.04 users who upgraded to 16.04, the 3.19 kernel (installed by 14.04) appears to remain usable.

Look in your /etc/mysql/ directory for a file with a \"deb10flag\" in the filename. (I can't remember exactly what the file  was named when I did this as it was a month ago.) I resolved it by removing the file with the debian10flag. This setting generated by the MariaDB installation (it sets the deb flag to version 10). I deleted /etc/mysql/ and cleaned out any trace of it from the bin. After doing all of that, there's a dependency issue with the mysql setup in the package repository. mysql-cli and mysql-server both depend on mysql-common. This is fixed (I think) by installing them in this order: (1) mysql-common, (2) mysql-cli, (3) mysql-server.\n**I know this isn't clear. I'll reply with the exact steps that I used to fix   this (soon). But the issue concerns the deb10flag and the dependency issues.\nhttps://askubuntu.com/a/766094/407584Same issue\n", "Q: Unable to run ifdown eth0 && ifup eth0 Joining our Ubuntu farm to a windows domain and after adding the DC's IP to /etc/network/interfaces, I try to bounce the interface as I've done on other Ubuntu servers and it errors out.\nifdown: interface eth0 not configured\nRTNETLINK answers: File exists\nFailed to bring up eth0\n\n/etc/network# cat run/ifstate shows:\nlo=lo\neth2=eth2\neth1=eth1\n\nI looked at /run/network/ifstate and added eth0=eth0 to the end of the file.  Still cannot run the command ifdown eth0 && ifup eth0\nDue to the nature of this server, I need to keep reboots to a minimum.  Does anyone have any ideas of what is causing this issue and how I can resolve it?

Ironically a nslookup of my AD domain works at this point.  I assume it's now using the DNS entry I added to the LAN port to do this.

I started having them come up with interfaces that weren't named eth0 and wlan0 but rather eth1 and wlan1.\nHere's what happened: There is a file that ties the MAC address of each adapter to the name of each adapter (eth{n} wlan{n} etc.).  If you boot up and the OS sees that eth0 is tied to some other MAC address (in my case, from the master machine) it will create a new interface called eth1 and things start breaking inside /etc/network/interfaces.\nSolution:  Delete the file /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules  and reboot (sorry, OP).  The file will be recreated at boot with the proper settings for this machine. \nFor those who experience this in the context of imaging like I did, think of deleting this file as sysprep.  You'll want to delete that and then capture your image before next boot of the OS.\nI can't be sure that my situation is the same as yours, but if it sounds like this makes sense, it shouldn't hurt to try it.

How to do do this? \n\nA: The root of the CD is /cdrom so for a preseed.cfg in the root must be: \nfile=/cdrom/preseed.cfg\n\nOf course, you can create a folder for preseeds and change the path (ex. folder /responses  will be file=/cdrom/responses/preseed.cfg)\nFor example I put a preseed file named xubuntu.cfg in the root of the CD and changed the 'append' option in txt.cfg with: \nlabel live-install\n  menu label ^Install Xubuntu\n  kernel /casper/vmlinuz.efi\n  append auto file=/cdrom/xubuntu.cfg keyboard-configuration/layoutcode=us and console-setup/ask_detect=false boot=casper automatic-ubiquity noprompt initrd=/casper/initrd.lz ---\n\n", "Q: Black flashes on Minecraft I recently installed ubuntu 14.04 on my laptop and wanted to install minecraft. It started perfectly fine (No black screens, no crashes) but after a few seconds, my whole screen goes black for 1 second, it only affect the screen where the game is running and does not stop my inputs (I can still move and do stuff but I don't see it). After it happens for the first time, the top of my screen starts to flicker and the black flashes become more and more frequent. It doesn't happen when I'm not moving.\nI tried updating java and the drivers for my graphic card but it didn't change anything.\nMy graphics card is a Nvidia Geforce GTX 950M\nI didn't have this problem when my computer was still on windows and it never happened on my desktop (also on ubuntu 14.04).\nIf you need any precisions on the nature of the problem or about my config, please ask.\nThanks\n\nA: The problem comes from the graphics card drivers, reinstall it by following this thread :Graphics issues after/while installing Ubuntu 16.04/16.10 with NVIDIA graphics (It's for 16.04 but works for 14.04)\nFor the install step, make sure you install the correct version of the driver (you can check which one you need for your GPU on Nvidia's website)\n", "Q: Enabling numlock I want numlock enabled everytime when Ubuntu starts. Here I found a guide how to do it, I just can not get into \"Keyboard Preferences\". When I go into \"Keyboard\" there are just \"Typing\" and \"Shortcuts\" tabs. In \"Text Entry\", there is nothing ragarding layout or preferences too. Or is that screenshot from older version and todays version doesnt contain these settings?\n\nA: If you want numlock to be enabled before getting to the login screen\nsudo apt-get install numlockx\nThen edit the file /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf\nAnd add this line to the bottom:\ngreeter-setup-script=/usr/bin/numlockx on\nThis will enable the numlock before you login as opposed to something like indicator-keylock which only loads with the desktop.  It's handy if you have numbers in your username or password and you want to use the number pad.\nIf you're not using lightdm and don't have the above mentioned file or directory, then put this into terminal:\nsudo sed -i 's|^exit 0.*$|# Numlock enable\\n[ -x /usr/bin/numlockx ] \\&\\& numlockx on\\n\\nexit 0|' /etc/rc.local\nThis will enabled it on boot, but in a different way.\n\nA: Personally I find the guide you mentioned unnecessarily complicated. The official Ubuntu Desktop Guide explains it clearer:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/stable/ubuntu-help/numeric-keypad.html\nHowever, the recommended command to make it work also on the login screen is about to be changed from using /usr/share to using /etc. Hence it will be:\nsudo sh -c 'printf \"[Seat:*]\\ngreeter-setup-script=numlockx on\\n\" >/etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf.d/50-numlock.conf'\n\nNote: Before this change has made it into Xenial, you need to first create the directory:\nsudo mkdir /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf.d\n\n\nA: Open a Terminal window and type:\n\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:tsbarnes/indicator-keylock\n  sudo apt-get update\n  sudo apt-get install indicator-keylock indicator-keylock'  \n\nThen press numlock key to activate it. The indicator will make sure it will remain active even after reboot.\n", "Q: Battery information is wrong I have replaced the battery in my laptop with a lower capacity battery than what was previously inserted.\nUbuntu hasn't calibrated the battery metering system, and so the statistics & percentages are completely off.\nHow can I re-calibrate it?\nEDIT\nAlready tried charging it overnight and discharging it completely to reset battery info.\nAlready tried holding power key for 10s while the battery and power is disconnected.\n\nA: Often, the battery statistics come from a combination of the battery model info read by either the Bios or possibly the operating system and the measured duration of the battery. I don't believe the battery model info is read every time but the metering system will need a calibration run for it to properly guess at the duration time of the replacement battery. Simply run the fully charged replacement battery down using the Laptop in a consistent (normal) manner until it forces a shutdown. Then a full recharge. This should correct the battery metering. The same technique is used when replacing UPS batteries.\nThe calibration run is basically helping the battery management system that is always trying to measure the power duration of the battery do it's thing. Given that the battery is expected to change (weaken) over time, this circuit is always fine tuning it's duration estimate.\nAs for the charging circuit, is the Laptop's charging light on (after the battery has been drained somewhat)? Did the battery re-charge? If so, charging circuit is fine.\n", "Q: Adding Ubuntu installed hard drive to new machine I've received a new computer which is windows.

If it still doesn't work, you could then try uninstalling the program(s) and reinstalling it/them. You could also check for keyboard drivers (even though Linux is Plug-and-Play), or if your computer is slow, because it could be some kind of lag.

You can exit the app, and then you're able to login in to the \"desktop\" session (named either Lubuntu or Lubuntu-Netbook) to use a browser, open other apps, etc.\nI've done this to install add-ons and packages, and upgrade Kodi itself (from 14 -> 16).\nNow if I've logged into a session, the USB remembers that I've done this, and instead of logging me into kodi upon next reboot, it goes into the last desktop (Lubuntu or Lubuntu-Netbook). To get the USB stick to log back into Kodi, I have to logoff Lubuntu/Lubuntu-Netbook and login to Kodi.\nSo my question is: where is this setting kept and how can I configure it to login to \"Kodi\" after I've logged into a Lubuntu desktop.\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: I found the answer.

You could easily write a simple Perl script to listen to an agreed-upon port (e.g. 30201) See this example from thegeekstuff.com. Have the server part accept 3 commands: \"kiosk\", \"desktop\" and \"quit\". \"kiosk\" and \"desktop\" set/clear a flag like /var/run/kiosk-mode. Start the server in /etc/init.

I am willing to start building some application for Ubuntu distribution of Linux. I am a Java developer and mostly deal with enterprise systems and some small website with PHP in my free time. \nI am willing to create some desktop applications for Ubuntu that I feel they are going to be useful but I don't know what programming language and how to it, can someone provide a guide on how to start ?\n\nA: If you're looking to build GUI applications for the Ubuntu desktop, I would suggest you start by looking into the Qt Framework. Qt is cross platform, and also has the benefit of serving as the underpinning to the Ubuntu SDK.  \nUnfortunately, as you're a Java developer I'm not sure how you can write Qt in Java.  There used to be a project called Qt Jambi, which provided Qt for Java.  I believe it is now defunct.  Perhaps someone else would like to comment on that.  Qt does provide a number of other language bindings if you're willing to switch.  \nIf you want to continue to use Java, perhaps you could look at Gtk as an alternate to Qt.  Gtk has java-gnome language binding for Java which appears to be still in development.  \n\nA: Use Python!\nIt's concise, and included as part of the platform. Many apps and tools are written in Python. You might start with this https://developer.ubuntu.com/en/desktop/examples/#snap-python. The advantage of this is that it will get you set up in launchpad to distribute to participate in the community and distribute your code.\nYou might also read this question: Developing Unity compliant apps in Python - where to start?\nFor GUI API's there are many.

Forgive this most basic question, but I couldn't find a direct answer or simple example on stack exchange.\nLet's say I have a folder of files that I would like to compress into one zip file that I can share with my terrible Windows friends (otherwise I'd just use tar and be done with it). It looks like this:\n.\n├── file1.txt\n├── file2.txt\n├── file3.txt\n├── file.jpg\n└── test.jpg\n\nAssuming I have zip installed:\nsudo apt-get install zip\n\nI see from man zip that it allows me to use a file list:\n\n-@ file lists.  If a file list is specified as -@ [Not on MacOS], zip takes the list  of  input  files\n         from standard input instead of from the command line.  For example,\n          zip -@ foo\n\n\nSo I created zip.lst which looks like this:\ncat zip.lst\n\nfile1.txt\nfile2.txt\nfile3.txt\nfile.jpg\ntest.jpg\n\nAnd now I tried:\nzip -@ zip.lst\n\nBut it didn't do anything except create a blank line on the console. And I can keep pushing Enter and it just keeps making more blank lines without seemingly executing the command. After some searching, I realized that I needed to terminate input by pressing Ctrl+D\nBut now I get this error:\n    zip warning: missing end signature--probably not a zip file (did you\n    zip warning: remember to use binary mode when you transferred it?)\n    zip warning: (if you are trying to read a damaged archive try -F)\n\nzip error: Zip file structure invalid (zip.lst)\n\nWhat!? How is my simple list not a \"valid file structure\"? Back to the manual for more information, and I take a closer look at:\n\nIf a file list is specified as -@...\n\nSo I try it without -@, and that at least processes it right away without having to press Ctrl+D but I'm left with the same error.\nLuckily, I found a comment on an answer to a nearly unrelated question that led me to realize that I needed to explicitly name the zip file. This error'd because by default it was trying to create a zip file called zip.lst. But since that's the name of my list, one might think that it would simply overwrite it, but no, it was in fact trying to update it. And since the list obviously isn't a zip file, we get the invalid file structure error, and now it's clear why it said \"probably not a zip file.\" So then I tried:\nzip files.zip zip.lst\n\nadding: zip.lst (deflated 35%)\n\nEureka!

Well, actually that makes sense from standard usage because it just zipped up the one list file I gave it.

But who wants to create a onetime-use list anyway? That's an awful round-about way of solving this particular scenario. It would be better to get a list from ls and pipe that to zip:\nls | zip -@ files.zip\n\n  adding: file1.txt (stored 0%)\n  adding: file2.txt (stored 0%)\n  adding: file3.txt (stored 0%)\n  adding: file.jpg (stored 0%)\n  adding: test.jpg (stored 0%)\n\nFabulous!

I had dual booted Ubuntu alongwith windows 10 in my system. Now I need to increase the disk space because everytime Ubuntu shows running out of space error. I looked up on different ways suggesting me to boot a CD/DVD and use Gparted but I did not get a clear or safe idea on how to di it.\nSo now I am thinking on removing Ubuntu and again dual boot it. Is this the better way or should I follow steps on increasing disk space. (Clearly I am not able to understand or follow steps on increasing disk space.)\n\nA: The best thing to do in response to the out of disk space message is to manage disk space better. \nFind out what is taking space.

I ask this as I notice that my machines take longer to shutdown if I shutdown via the GUI. \n\nA: Did you mean sudo shutdown -h now?\nAnyways, as long as you use this ^^^ command, there should be no difference.\nIt probably takes longer to shut down from GUI since it has to kill the X server and such, whilst if shutting down from CLI they are already dead.\n", "Q: Problem initializing Ubuntu 16.04 - \"system running in low-graphics mode\" I'm having problem booting up my ubuntu 16.04.\nI started up my computer today and my login screen looked like something out of the 90's (A 256 color looking square box asking for login and password).\nAfter entering my login and password, the wallpaper showed up but nothing else. I tried running the command startx in the tty but I got an error message.\nAfter rebooting a few times, a message box started showing up before login, saying \"The system is running in low-graphics mode\" and stating that my graphics card could not be detected correctly. After this box, another one shows up asking me what I'd like to do, but I can't get pass this one since I don't have the mouse on screen.\nMy graphics card is an intel HD 3000.\nDoes anyone knows how to solve this problem?\n\nA: I just recently had a similar issue, but it was my own fault, I was testing stuff on my workstation, and not in a VM, but that is besides the point.\nIn the end I booted into a live USB, moved all my files off, and reinstalled.  Now that was drastic I know, but I was frustrated by the inability to log in and do anything to fix the problem.  That all being said, between when your machine last worked and when this started, what have you installed?  Any new hardware, or software?  \nIf hardware can you remove it and try restarting?  Hopefully this fixes the issue.\nIf software, you can get into a terminal only mode by holding the shift key when rebooting, this will take you to your grub loader, and from there you should see something like Ubuntu repair mode, or something that sounds safe.  Choose that boot mode, and it will give you a lot of options for trying, but the one I am looking for you to do is the command prompt one, go into that and back out what you last installed, you would do that using this command:\nsudo apt-get remove [program-name]\n\nIf you installed multiple then try backing out each one, and reboot each time, but if you are dumb like me, you copied and pasted the install commands from a website, and so have no clue what the command was....(I live on the edge).\nAnyway if all that does not work, and no-one here smarter than me has a better answer than what I have given, then my answer up front is the answer, login on LIVE USB/CD, get your data off the machine, and re-install.\nI hope this helps in some way.

I'm running 14.04 and I figured out how to edit theme colors recently so I changed some colors in the Ambiance gtk-main.css file. \nI have the nautilus bg color set to dark grey and I want the text to be white. My problem is that when text is set to white, it also effects firefox text color which results in me not being able to see what I'm typing there (white text on white backgrounds). The same thing happens when I try to rename a folder or file in nautilus.\nHow can I keep the text color for labels in nautilus white while having other text (like in firefox and renaming files) stay black? (The line I edited to change text color is @define-color text_color under default color scheme in the gtk file). Thanks.\n*EDIT: I just solved this by making the fg color black and keeping the text color white (can be done in the same file). \n\nA: Solved. I made the fg color black and kept text white.

I see you've already tried that option. Maybe specify a scheduled shutdown instead, or do sudo shutdown instead. Often the -h now command messes up shutting the PC down. Also, is there a power button located anywhere on your machine? \nFor example, I have a desktop (HP Envy 750-045z), and when I want to shut it down, but sudo shutdown -h now does not work, I simply walk over to my desktop case and hold down the power button for a solid 6 seconds.\nThis seems to work.

I type python in a terminal window. I get Python 2.7 and not Python 3.5. According to the docs, Python 3.5 should come preloaded.\n\nA: You assume that the default Python should be available as python. That assumption is wrong.\nIt is an unlucky situation that obsolete Python 2 (python) comes first during shell Tab-expansion, before current and default Python 3 (python3) on systems which have both. The naming itself certainly does not help finding the default either, but there is a reason behind that.\nOn a system that comes with Python 3 “preloaded” and no Python 2 at all, there will be only python3 and no python.\nCode written for Python 3 should always look for an interpreter called python3. Code written for Python 2 will historically look for python.\nThis way, there will be no extra and unnecessary breakage, neither for new nor old scripts from any uncertainty of what python might point to.\nThere might come a point in time, possibly decades from now, where almost no-one remembers Python 2, when python might start to refer to python3. This would be purely for convenience, and can and should not be done premature, if at all! There is no hurry, because of the following impact:\n“Current old” systems will have no knowledge of python2, only python, so it makes perfect sense to keep Python 2 code looking for python. This is the reason why python should refer to Python 2 for “as long as Python 2 code exists”.\nNew code written for Python 2, if that makes sense, can perfectly look for python. It might also look for python2, if it is intended to run only on Python 3 aware and well groomed systems (which might offer such link).\nThe benefit of Python 2 code using python2 would be that it needs no extra touching once python starts referring to python3, which might never happen, or once python disappears at all, which might or might not happen. (That might come true, if Python 2 code dies out after hypothetical Python 4 becomes popular with its interpreter python4. – Because letting it point to either python3 or python4 would both be confusing.)\nNote: The Arch Linux distribution did not follow the recommendation and lets python point to Python 3.\n\nA: I don't know what \"docs\" you are reading nor what they say, but the /usr/bin/python is just a symbolic link to the default version of python, in this case 2.7, which is the result of just typing python on the terminal. This is the result of PEP 394 which defines that\n\n  \n*\n  \n*for the time being, all distributions should ensure that python refers to the same target as python2. \n  \n\ntype python and file /usr/bin/python will confirm this.\nThe reason for this arrangement other than the convention, is that the source package python-defaults in Xenial is the version 2.7.11, so the python symbolic link points to this version.\nTo use python 3 you have to be explicit and type python3 in the command line, which is recommended in case you need an specific version, this can also be done with python 2, typing python2. Ubuntu includes both python 2 and 3 versions by default on all current versions.\nThere are plans to migrate everything to python 3 and marking it as the default.\n\nA: Python both 2.x, 3.x versions are available. if you call python as it is pointed to python 2.x it will load python 2.x\nBelow image will help you.\n\n\nA: Python 3.x  should work with 16.04 - Actually, it definitely WILL work. I have Ubuntu 14.04 and I have Python 3.4.3 - All you have to do to test it is type in python3 and it should tell you what version you're running.\n\nA: To get the Python 3.5 REPL or run a script that's compatible, type python3. This is to maintain compatibility with all the legacy python 2.x (which has always been, and will remain linked to python).\nThe dash could find python if you set up a .desktop file for it (in ~/.local/share/applications/), to open a terminal and start the REPL for instance. There isn't a default GUI REPL environment for python, and normal interface expectations are that the user would go to the terminal.\nThe talk of python 3.5 being default is the maintainers porting all system scripts from python 2.x over to python 3.x, not that python 3 would replace python 2 in all cases.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 16.04: Menu Bar (Sublime Text, Terminal, etc) missing It only appears when run with sudo.\n\n\n\nA: Open a terminal and type unity and hit return, after you have your desktop back close the terminal and reopen it normally. Actually i have the same problem on my second computer but i do this direct after boot up and have then menu bars everywhere. As far i know this is a known bug and a fix is in the making, just couldn't find the link anymore. \n\nA: Press CTRL+ALT+T and type in unity - Once you've pressed Enter on your keyboard, it should prompt you to login. Login, and hopefully you will see your Unity desktop! In my opinion, the Unity desktop environment, including the launcher, is very organized and clean. I use the Gnome Tweak Tool and I use the Oxygen theme (GTK) to provide extra cleanse to my OS. I have Ubuntu 14.04 dual booting with Windows 7 Professional, and since the day I got Ubuntu, I haven't used Windows. Funny. Anyway, to get back on topic, press CTRL + ALT + T once more and type in sudo -s - This will prompt you for your password, and allow you to get root permissions. Once you're in the root, type in unity again and send that command into the terminal by pressing return or enter. Then, login once more, and open the Terminal, AGAIN. Simply close it, and you should be good. This worked for me on my Chromebook Pixel, and hopefully it will work for you. By the way, I didn't use ChromeOS on the Chromebook Pixel - I got Ubuntu and then erased ChromeOS off of it. Chromebook Pixel computers are basically the best laptops on the market, except for the OS. But once you've  got a certain file called \"crouton\" it will allow you to enter a certain command into the terminal, returning in Ubuntu! You can even specify a desktop environment, but I would stick to Unity, and then manually run sudo apt-get install kubuntu-full for the clean Oxygen theme and KDE-simple cursor/window pack.\n\nA: I figured out that easiest way to fix the problem is to reinstall ubuntu desktop.\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall ubuntu-desktop\n\nI hope this would work for you also.\n", "Q: bash send output from command to variable I am trying someting very easy, I have seen some answer, but they do not work\nI am trying to send the output of ls-al to a variable\nsome code before this line\nif [[ $ans == \"L\"* ]];then\n\n      text=$(ls-al)\n\n      zenity --info --title=\"contenu du repertoire\" --text=$text\n\n fi\n\nwhen I try this, I get the error ./testzenity: ligne 10: ls-al : commande introuvable\nthis is in french and it means command not found\nI have the same result with  text=ls-al``\nI even tried read text << (ls-al), but htis time i get\n./testzenity: ligne 12: erreur de syntaxe près du symbole inattendu « ( »\nwhich means syntax error near symbol \"(\"\n\nWhat am I doing wrong, this is very basic\n\nOk, the first par of the script works, now I have a problem with Zenity\nhere is the code (well, part of it)\n#!/bin/bash\nans=$(zenity --list --text \"Faites votre choix \" --title \"Menu utilitaire\" --radiolist \\\n\n --column \"\" --column \"Choix\" \\\n\n   TRUE   \"Lister le contenu du repertoire\" \\\n\nFALSE  \"Editer un fichier\" \\\n\n   FALSE  \"Crer un nouvel usager\" \\\n\n   FALSE  \"Quitter\" )\n\n   if [[ $ans == \"L\"* ]];then\n\n      text=$(ls -al)\n\n  zenity --text-info --title=\"contenu du repertoire\" --text=$(text)\n   fi\n\nI am trying to output the content of the variable text into a textinfo or text box, the text-info box open with the title, but no text inside the box\n\nA: Here ./testzenity: ligne 10: ls-al : commande introuvable it saying.

I've read you need to use Wine, and I'm just wondering how exactly I go about doing this correctly. I've read a lot of conflicting information.\n\nA: Once you have installed wine, you can download the Windows version of steam and install it.  Then you run this version of steam through wine and download your windows games.  I have had mixed success with this approach, but in many cases it's better than dual booting.\n\nA: I would recommend PlayOnLinux as a front end for Wine.\nTo install PlayOnLinux run the following commands from a terminal window:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install playonlinux\n\nNote, PlayOnLinux installs Wine if it is not installed.\nAfter it is installed and you run it for the first time, you will see an application that looks like this:\n\nClick on the Install button.  In the search box, type in Steam.  Select Steam.  Then click Install in the lower right.  PlayOnLinux should download the needed files to install Steam.  Note: Unfortunately, not every application is downloaded like this.  Some applications will have to be downloaded manually, or you need the installation media.\n\nPlayOnLinux should configure Wine for the application if it is found in the install menu like Steam is.  Sometimes you might need to search https://www.winehq.com for tweaks to games to make them work correctly.\nWhen it is completed, all you should have to do is to click on Steam in the box, then click Run above, or you can double-click on Steam to launch it.\n\nHope this helps!\n\nA: You can install the Linux version of Steam and enable proton/playonlinux in the game's properties. Steam will then enable the install button. As part of the install, it will download the nessasry files for proton.\nYou can also do this with Linux compatible games if you wish.\nThe advantage of doing it this way is that it allows you to play Linux only games still, as well as playing Windows/Linux games natively.\nEdit.

Try to modify the /etc/ssh/sshd_config to this value, restart the ssh service ans try once more.\n\nA: You'll get this error if the remote server is running Dropbear rather than OpenSSH. \n\nSSHFS uses SFTP, and Dropbear doesn't provide SFTP. So when you try\n  to use it, the Dropbear server sees a request for a subsystem that it\n  doesn't understand and drops the connection.\n\nFrom here: https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/363540/mount-a-filesystem-using-sshfs-using-the-dropbear-server-on-yocto-firmware\n\nA: I am not sure if it helps, but I had similar problem\nremote host has disconnected\n\nand after some googling&browsing I realised, that actually I connected ssh via different port.\nSo, for example, I had to connect via ssh (example, assuming port number 1234):\nssh username@example.com -p 1234\n\ninstead of standard ssh when port number is 22. So the same had to be used for sshfs connection:\nsshfs username@example.com:/ ~/testfolder -p 1234\n\nIt solved my problem.\n\nA: Old question, but the first one that comes up for this problem.\nMy issue was the server required key authentication, but I was running the command using sudo and specifying -o IdentityFile=~/.ssh/id_rsa, meaning ~ was expanded to root's home, not mine.\nSpecifying the full path worked, and I imagine using $HOME would have too (because it would have expanded earlier).\n\nA: One more cause that happened to me was that the dropbearmulti binary itself lacked the string /usr/libexec/sftp-server which got lost somewhere around build 33600 of DD-WRT. Check if said binary mentions this file or it won't work even if it's present. I had to use a binary from build 33525 and make a launcher that kills the normal buggy dropbear, then runs this one. You create a symlink called dropbear pointing to dropbearmulti. You stop the current one with stopservice sshd, then run the working one. See in ps what the proper parameters look like.\nIt's best to have it on jffs (or unpack it to /tmp) so that you could still umount any drive.\n\nA: If you are able to connect the host via ssh by itself:\nssh xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx\n\nYou may be prompted to save the key, you ned to type YES, not just a Y.  You should then be asked for the username and password for the user on that remote machine.  \nUse the one you are trying to do sshfs with, post back your results.\nIf you get a connection refused, I am guessing that you have not installed SSH on the remote computer.  Open ssh can be installed with this command, run on the remote computer:\nsudo apt install openssh-server\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu isn't playing dvd Same DVD is playing in windows, but ubunut(16.04) isn't displaying any media. /media/ directory is empty.

Both are FAT32 format and first is 20 GB and second partition is of 10 GB.\nI use 1st partition for file storage as it is detected in windows and 2nd partition is not detected (don't event want to) which I want to create bootable persistent Ubuntu.\nWhile using Startup disk creator in Ubuntu 16.04, it only shows whole USB as a single and there is no option to select from two partitions.\n\nHow could I use 2nd partition to create bootable using Startup Disk Creator.\n\nA: There is a tool that can create a persistent live drive and make partitions automatically, mkusb. The first partition 'usbdata' has an NTFS file system, and the intention is to use it for file sharing with Windows computers.\nThe following links helps you install and use mkusb for this purpose,\nhelp.ubuntu.com/community/mkusb\nhelp.ubuntu.com/community/mkusb/persistent\n\nA: UPDATE\nI believe your answer is right here:\nLive USB on a 2-partition usb-drive\nENDUPDATE\nOK, so I created two partitions on an 8gb flash drive, I then put an ISO on the drive using Disk Image Writer  Unfortuently it over wrote all the partitions and created this:\n \nAs you can see the ISO takes up very little space including the second partition which I believe is the swap.  But it did leave 6.6gb of free space.\nMy suggestion is that you save the data off your drive, burn the ISO, and then take the free space and make that data space, and move your data back on there.  As long as you use FAT or NTFS, windows should not have an issue mounting the drive.\n\nA: I tried to do this as well. There is a problem though. In windows only the first partition will be visible. Even if you use startup disk creator in Linux, your windows will only see the partition containing the bootable Linux. \nHowever this should only be true on USB pen drives. USB HDD or SSD should not encounter this problem.\n\nA: Making the drive be bootable requires overwriting the beginning of the whole drive so all partitions are lost because the partition table is overwritten.  Once you have made a Linux boot image then adding a FAT or NTFS partition after that should be seen be Windows.  Backup your data.\n", "Q: Meizu Pro 5 Ubuntu edition - temperature units How I can change temperature units from Fahrenheit to Celsius on the Weather scope?\n\nA: The unit of temperature in the weather scope and the weather part in the today scope is related to the language setting of your phone (System Settings - Personal: Language & Text - Display language). \nThere is only one issue, and this has been reported as a bug already (as pomsky pointed out in his comment), for which however a work-around is available:\nUp until OTA-8, choosing English-Canada gave us the chance to have the phone set to English and still showing temperatures in Celsius. Since OTA-9 this is not working anymore.\nWork-around, if you want your phone to be set to English using Celsius as unit for temperature: Switch your language to English-Australia.\n\nA: Go to your apps scope, click on weather, go to the gearwheel symbol in the upper right corner. \nYou can find the Celsius setting under 'units.\n", "Q: Window titles disappear when setting scale to 0.875 on 16.04 When I set Scale for window and title bars to 0.875 in System Settings -> Screen Display, the window title text disappears in all windows.

I have 4 primary partitions and I'm trying to install Ubuntu alongside windows 10 (pics included) As seen in my Disk Management window, I have 4 primary partitions. I know that C: is my windows partition, and F: is where I put all my downloads and other programs, but I do not know how important the G: and E: partitions are.\nI checked the properties on the drives, and they use the Master Boot Record (MBR) system, which means I can only have 4 primary partitions.\nI'm thinking of deleting the HP_RECOVERY (G:) partition, but I'm unsure of it's important to system functionality. I personally have never needed to recover my PC, but I'm not sure if I should delete it.\n\nA: You could delete the partition without problems. But if you ever need to recover your windows you need a usb drive or dvd with windows install. \nThis will also cause you to lose all your specific HP software. And also you might need to search for your drivers yourself.\nNo biggy if you know what you're doing.\nAbout dual installing: This is the tutorial that I used.\nhttp://linuxbsdos.com/2012/05/17/how-to-dual-boot-ubuntu-12-04-and-windows-7/\nIt is written for Ubuntu 12.04 but the install process remains the same. Small tip ahead: give your boot partition more room than the advised 500MB.\n\nA: In Windows you should have a make recovery disks app, make and burn those disks before you get rid of the recovery partition, that is where HP puts all the files to reset your computer back to the way they sold it to you.\nThe program will be in a folder may be called HP tools or some such thing.\n\nA: If you can back up the largest data partition then delete it then the free space can be made into an extended partition which can then contain lots of sub partitions. You could then restore your data to a partition and install Ubuntu in another. You can do this in windows with fdisk and the Ubuntu installer should pick up the empty partitions\n", "Q: Problem with dependencies while installing ubuntu-sdk on 16.04 I get this error while installing ubuntu-sdk on clean install of Ubuntu 16.04 64bit:\nThe following packages have unmet dependencies:\n ubuntu-sdk : Depends: ubuntu-sdk-libs-dev but it is not going to be installed\n              Depends: autopilot-desktop but it is not installable\n              Depends: intltool but it is not installable\n              Depends: libcontent-hub-doc but it is not installable\n              Depends: phablet-tools but it is not going to be installed\n              Depends: ubuntu-device-flash but it is not going to be installed\n              Depends: ubuntu-sdk-ide but it is not going to be installed\nE: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages.`\n\nHow to solve this issue.\n\nA: You need to install some dependencies separately one by one.\nIn my case it was throwing :\nSome packages could not be installed.

My PC runs on Ubuntu 14.04 and hosts an Oracle VB. Since installing the VB I have twice received notifications asking me to  download and install a newer version of Extension Pack, and I have done so. But as a result, I now have two redundant setup files of older versions of the Extension Pack. Can anyone having the relevant experience please tell me whether it is safe to simply delete these redundant files? Or should I,before installing the new Ext Pack, first uninstall the earlier one and, in that case,  what is the way to do it? \n(The notification from Oracle asked me to upgrade, and I suppose upgrading would have automatically taken care of all this. But for some reason, the \"Upgrade\" option is not working and I have to manually install the new Ext Pack from the freshly downloaded setup file. Hence my problem.)\n\nA: It's perfectly safe to delete the old versions of the files once the new version has been installed. The only exception would be if you wanted to roll back to an older version of VirtualBox, though that would entail installing it outside of the normal apt framework, so is quite unusual. Also all of the previous extension packs are still available on the Oracle download page.\nI normally install the new extension pack using the --replace option to uninstall the old extension pack at the same time, like so (replace the extension pack name with the correct one):\nvboxmanage extpack install --replace /path/to/Oracle_VM_VirtualBox_Extension_Pack-4.3.36-105129.vbox-extpack\n\nI also make sure that this is the extpack used by virtualbox for VRDP connections with:\nvboxmanage setproperty vrdeextpack \"Oracle VM VirtualBox Extension Pack\"\n\nThough this final step may be unnecessary if completed for a previous extension pack.\n", "Q: Debugging preseed/late_command for ubuntu 16.04 server: tee not found vs nonexistent directory I am trying to run the following preseed file on a ubuntu 16.04 server machine (during a packer build):\nd-i preseed/late_command string \\\nin-target mkdir -v -p -m 0440 \"/etc/sudoers.d\"; \\\nin-target echo \"%vagrant ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL\" | tee -a /etc/sudoers.d/vagrant; \\\nin-target echo \"Defaults:vagrant !requiretty\" | tee -a /etc/sudoers.d/vagrant; \\\nin-target chmod 440 /etc/sudoers.d/vagrant;\n\nIn /var/log/installer/syslog I can see the following error:\nlog-output: sh:\nlog-output: tee: not found\n\nWhen I change the \"| tee -a\" part to \">>\" like so:\nd-i preseed/late_command string \\\nin-target mkdir -v -p -m 0440 \"/etc/sudoers.d\"; \\\nin-target echo \"%vagrant ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL\" >> /etc/sudoers.d/vagrant; \\\nin-target echo \"Defaults:vagrant !requiretty\" >> /etc/sudoers.d/vagrant; \\\nin-target chmod 440 /etc/sudoers.d/vagrant;\n\nIt suddenly starts complaining it cannot find the directory, without saying anything about the mkdir line - so it's neither creating the directory, nor not finding it:\nlog-output: sh: can't create /etc/sudoers.d/vagrant: nonexistent directory\nlog-output: sh: can't create /etc/sudoers.d/vagrant: nonexistent directory\nlog-output: chmod:\nlog-output: cannot access '/etc/sudoers.d/vagrant'\nlog-output: : No such file or directory\n\nI have been looking into other scripts on github.

This is especially useful for\n  running things like dpkg-reconfigure, debconf-apt-progress, and tasksel.\n  The log-output utility is used to log any output; if in-target is called\n  with the option --pass-stdout, log-output will respect it.\n\n\nA: It doesn't seem to work to use echo into in-target. To solve this try the following (tried in Ubuntu 18.04):\nd-i preseed/late_command string \\\n    echo \"some text\" >> /target/path/to/file.ext ; \\\n    in-target [some-other-command-in-target]\n\nNOTE:\n\n\n*\n\n*Don't use in-target before the line\n\n*Use /target before the real path\n\n*In other commands you can mostly use in-target before the line\n\n\nA: If you prefer to use debian installer, this worked for me on 17.10.1 server when adding an ssh public key to authorized_keys. You have to make sure the .ssh directory is created beforehand.\nd-i preseed/late_command string in-target /bin/sh -c 'echo \"my string\" >> /home/username/.ssh/authorized_keys';\n\nI spent about a day debugging this and tried the following with various results. It would be nice if there were more detailed documentation on which shell is used in debian installer for the various non / 'in-target' directives but I am probably not looking in right place.\n\n\n*\n\n*plain in-target echo with plain authorized_keys path:\nin-target echo \"my string\" >> /home/username/.ssh/authorized_keys;\n\ngives \"directory not found\" in /var/log/installer/syslog\n\n*plain in-target echo with target authorized_keys path:\nin-target echo \"my string\" >> /target/home/username/.ssh/authorized_keys;\n\nproduces a blank authorized_keys file on the target machine and when viewing /var/log/installer/syslog you find \"my string\" is output to stdout\n\n*in-target with explicit sh -c... and target authorized_keys path:\nin-target /bin/sh -c 'echo \"my string\" >> /target/home/username/.ssh/authorized_keys';\n\nproduces a \"directory not found\" error in /var/log/installer/syslog\nHopefully this saves a bit of time and debugging!\n\nA: You can use Ubiquity instead of Debian-Installer (https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Installer/FAQ), so your command would be:\nubiquity  ubiquity/success_command string \\\n in-target /bin/mkdir -v -p -m 0440 \"/target/etc/sudoers.d\"; \\\n in-target /bin/echo \"%vagrant ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL\" >> /target/etc/sudoers.d/vagrant; \\\n in-target /bin/echo \"Defaults:vagrant !requiretty\" >> /target/etc/sudoers.d/vagrant; \\\n in-target /bin/chmod 440 /target/etc/sudoers.d/vagrant\n\nIt solves the \"no such file or directory\" reported by pointing to the right place: /target/etc/\n\nA: echo will work from within an in-target directive.  You have to put it with back-ticks (`).  For example, I wanted to update the host name of my machine from the preseed file:\nin-target hostname echo \"ubn\"$(lshw | grep -m 1 serial | awk '{print tolower ($2)}')\nBack-ticks tells the shell to run this as one command.  \n", "Q: How to exclude LAMP from startup in 16.04 Regarding the following command and result:\n$ systemd-analyze blame | grep -P '(mysql|php|apache)'\n         12.936s mysql.service\n          8.815s php7.0-fpm.service\n          6.515s apache2.service\n\nI want to remove LAMP from startup so my system boot faster.

I can't log in, can't insert any commands and can't boot from a USB. Please help.\n\nA: Try a liveCD. If you can't boot even a livecd, you need to go to BIOS/UEFI menu and change the boot device order. Choose CD/DVD driver first, then USB or usb-zip, then HDD/SSD. Save changes, exit BIOS/UEFI, and reboot. On some laptops it is enough to just press ESC key at startup and a boot menu will appear asking you what device to boot from.\n", "Q: Streamline use of IPA notation in Libreoffice I use Character Map regularly alongside LibreOffice writer to write IPA (international phonetic alphabet) notation. All the (30ish) characters I need are in the 'Latin' script list, but there are many characters in this list that I do not need, and consequently it is a long process to find the characters I want, and making IPA notation is very time consuming. How can I streamline writing IPA notation in LibreOffice?\nI am using Ubuntu 16.04\n\nA: To type in IPA, switch to an IPA keyboard layout.  It is much faster than hunting through the Character Map.

It is important to remember which package it installs (if it isn't obvious from the name then google it) in order to be able to remove it from recovery mode if your system doesn't boot afterwards. Reboot to see if it got fixed. If it doesn't work then remove it.\n\n*If step 2 and 3 doesn't work then set nomodeset at /etc/default/grub file as described at the first link to make it permanent.

There's no real reason to avoid the cd; especially if you put this in a shell script, as the cd will affect just the script, not the shell you call the script from.\nIf you really really don't wan't to use cd, you can use tars --transform option:\ngbl@roran:~$ tar -cf /tmp/archive.tar /home/gbl/Temp/a.out\ngbl@roran:~$ tar -tf /tmp/archive.tar\nhome/gbl/Temp/a.out\n\ngbl@roran:~$ tar --transform 's/^home\\/gbl//' -cf /tmp/archive2.tar /home/gbl/Temp/a.out\ngbl@roran:~$ tar -tf /tmp/archive2.tar\n/Temp/a.out\n\ngbl@roran:~$ tar --transform 's/^home\\/gbl\\///' -cf /tmp/archive3.tar /home/gbl/Temp/a.out\ngbl@roran:~$ tar -tf /tmp/archive3.tar\nTemp/a.out\n\nI omitted some tar: Removing leading '/' from member names messages here as they don't contribute to the answer.\nUse any sed regular expression for the transformation, read the manual for a few more options.\nThere's also --strip-components to remove that many path components from the start of the file name, but it works on extraction only, not when you create an archive.\nHowever, this is restricted to gnu tar, so you'll be ok on Linux, but probably not whenever you switch to MacOS, Solaris, or AIX.

They have been ignored, or old ones used instead\n\n\nA: Sounds like your local package repository is out of sync, or your package list of what to install is out of sync.\n404 Not Found means the packages aren't available in the repository that the system wants, so you only have a few options here.\nIf the repository is out of sync:\nResync your repository with the main ones, run apt-get update as normal on the system that uses it, after the sync is finished.\nIf resyncing the repository doesn't work:\nTell the computer to use archive.ubuntu.com (or one of its country mirror) servers for getting updates.\n", "Q: Can partitioning an SSD using third party software damage my computer if I am exceeding the space allowed by Disk Management? I am partitioning my disk to install Ubuntu as a secondary OS on my computer.\nI have searched through other questions on askubuntu concerning what to do if Disk Management does not allow you to shrink your partition enough e.g. you have 100 gb of free space, but you can only partition 10 gb\nThe solutions usually indicate to use third-party software like gparted or Mini-tool partition wizard.\nHowever, could I lose data if I bypass Windows' partition limits using this software? \nFor example, Disk management's maximum shrink volume is 10 gb, but you use software to shrink 50 gb \n\nA: This depends on whether 3rd party software is buggy. To resize a partition with data the software should do a complex (and, in case of NTFS, never published) trick to move parts of file system away from the end of partition. Can it do the thing right? Who knows...\n\nA: Try this website below:\nhttps://sites.google.com/site/easylinuxtipsproject/ssd\nIt wlll tell you some things to make your ssd more efficient and protect it from overwriting.  I did not try this myself.\n\nA: Normally, it wouldn't. Third party software just have the tech to relocate files marked unmovable in Disk Management. \n", "Q: wifi problem on ubuntu 16.04..!

It may ask additional dependency, Download and install them separately. \n\nA: It looks like the kernal can detect your hardware but lacks the driver software to make it work, so what you need to do is install the drivers for your wireless card.  I searched broadcom's website but I couldn't find the drivers for your wireless card but I found another driver that is similar enough that it might work for you.

I have the following questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I create a new primary partition for installing CentOS? I had tried fdisk /dev/sda and the respective commands to create a primary partition but it doesn't appear when I view my partitions.\n\n*Once I have installed CentOS on my new primary partition how do I switch between Ubuntu and CentOS? I have come across GRUB and other boot managers like zBootManager,Boot-US but would appreciate if someone could provide suggestions on which one is better.\n\nA: *\n\n*You can simply shrink your ubuntu partition, and the installer for CentOS should let you use that space. I don't know the CentOS installer well, so in reality the answer is that you should shrink your Ubuntu partition using GParted or similar, then follow the installation instructions for CentOS to install it onto the free space you've created. If you need assistance with CentOS, you should use their forums.\n\n*GRUB is probably the most suited boot manager, this question seems to be more opinionated though (going against the regulations of this site). With regards to selecting which OS on boot, you will be prompted with a command line UI and asked to select an OS. If you don't select one within 10 seconds or so, it will automatically select your \"primary\" OS, which in my experience is the last one you installed, but you can change this within Ubuntu or CentOS.\n\nA: Do not use fdisk if you are not sure what you are going to do. Use Gparted instead. You can not edit the partition with your current OS, too. So boot your PC from Ubuntu USB stick or any other LiveCD that contains Gparted, and use it to resize and create partitions. Backup important data before that!\n\nA: *\n\n*Why struggle with fdisk? Just install GParted and use it graphically. Or use it directly from an Ubuntu LiveDVD/LiveUSB. GParted sees any and all partitions. Guaranteed. \n\n*GRUB will install automatically with Ubuntu and CentOS. You should be fine with it. The ultimate boot manager i believe is rEFInd, but i wouldn't rush into it unless i know very well what i'm doing.\n", "Q: pam / ad issues with server-based application Following the 16.04 upgrade we had some pam / ad issues which were solved based on community answers (ie lockscreen, authentication). \nWe now have a new and critical one.

I was prviously on Ubuntu 14.04, using Intel graphics driver in Ubuntu 16.04, installed from here:\nhttps://download.01.org/gfx/ubuntu/14.04/\nVideo acceleration worked just fine in VLC in 14.04. But, now I have several issues with video acceleration, including the inability to scale the video. So, I want to use graphics drivers provided by Intel, but unfortuanately there is no prebuilt packages for 16.04 in 01.org repositories.

Intel drivers are included in the default installation of Ubuntu 16.04 with Linux 4.2 kernel, and you the hardware acceleration works in VLC if you choose \"XCB\" output. But this is not the latest drivers from Intel. Here we read:\n\n\n*\n\n*u16.04 already contains the latest intel driver that has passed full QA\n\n*There is no point in installing the u15.10 updates on u16.04 - even if you succeeded it would be a downgrade\n\n\nRecent update:\nRecently, Intel released Intel Graphics Update Tool 2.0.2 which supports Ubuntu 16.04. Download it from here:\nhttps://01.org/linuxgraphics/downloads/intel-graphics-update-tool-linux-os-v2.0.2\n\n\nA: I had the same problem.\nI have solved it by install intel driver like below (i think it's a part of the solution ;-) ) AND chose the GLX video output in VLC setting. \n\n\nA: I temporarily replaced the contents of /etc/lsb-release with:\nDISTRIB_ID=Ubuntu\nDISTRIB_RELEASE=15.10\nDISTRIB_CODENAME=wily\nDISTRIB_DESCRIPTION=\"Ubuntu 15.10\"\n\nIn this way \"Graphics Installer 1.4.0 for Ubuntu* 15.10, 32-bit\" was installed.\nBefore reboot I restored the original contents of /etc/lsb-release. Drivers work fine.\n", "Q: USB set to write protect mode I used the dd command to burn a bootable Ubuntu distro (ISO file) to my USB.  Now the entire drive is completely \"read only\".  It's impossible to modify it! I tried switching to root and executed several different commands:\nhdparm -r0\nsudo chmod -R -v 777 *\nchown -R -v\nchmod ugo+wx /\n\nBasically, all the tricks listed on StackExchange by people that experienced the same problem failed. Nothing seems to work!!  I got so frustrated that I walked over and plugged it into a WinXP box to get it to r/w.  It managed to copy a small file to a 2MB boot partition that appeared in Windows Explorer as FAT32.  \nChanging the partition type with fdisk, somehow split the USB into two partitions, the small 2MB FAT32 partition that I copied the WinXP file to and the large partition that holds the Ubuntu data.  My head is stuck in the sand. Mounting it with the RW option didn't work either.  \n\nA: In the worst case, the flash drive has either a defect or has died.\nI bought three identical Patriot 32GB Supersonic drives from an online retailer and one of them was \"write protected\" out of the box.  I went to the manufacturer's website and, after downloading and trying their own tool just to be sure, they granted an RMA without any fuss about it.  I had a new, working drive a week later.\nBest of luck to you.\n\nA: Try sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/<device>. That will completely overwrite the drive with zeros. Then you can format it to FAT 32 or whatever using the Disks utility.\n\nA: ok!  It turns out that .iso file that I had copied to the USB via dd cmd, is actually stored in a special file-system/format: iso9660, that's read-only according to the \"experts.\"  The easiest solution is to make a small partition on the USB just for the iso marked \"bootable\" with cfdisk, and then a separate partition(s) for the remaining portion of the USB with gparted or cfdisk.\n", "Q: Unable to update with 'apt-get': errors Can't run sudo apt-get update , I get errors like:  \nE: Type '--2016-05-25' is not known on line 1 in source list /etc/apt/sources.list.d/playonlinux.list\nE: The list of sources could not be read.\n\n\nA: The repository file needs to be fixed for PlayOnLinux.

Is there a way for an ubuntu snap to provide files in the FHS filesystem hierarchy, e.g. binaries in /usr/bin, package data in /usr/share/, configuration files in /etc ?\nIf not, what is the best practice to use such resources provided by a snap?\nShall one use /snap// instead of  every time?\n\nA: No, a snap is self-contained. It may of course contain a bin/, usr/bin/, etc. within itself, but it cannot place things into the system's /bin/, /usr/bin/, etc.\nThe best practice to utilize such resources provided by the snap is to export them from the snap using the \"apps\" keyword in the YAML. For example, say I have an executable shell script called hello.sh, which contains the following:\n#!/bin/sh\necho \"hello snap guru\"\n\nAnd I have a snapcraft.yaml that looks like this:\nname: hello\nversion: 1\nsummary: my summary\ndescription: my description\n\napps:\n  run:\n    command: hello.sh\n\nparts:\n  hello:\n    plugin: copy\n    files:\n      hello.sh: bin/\n\nAfter you run snapcraft on this and install the resulting snap, you'll notice that hello.sh is contained within the snap's bin/ directory, which is of course not in your PATH so you can't directly call it. However, when the snap is installed, snappy creates a new script inside /snap/bin/ for each item in the \"apps\" keyword (run in this case), and /snap/bin/ is in your PATH. You should be able to run the hello.sh script just by using <snap name>.<app name>:\n$ hello.run\nhello snap guru\n\n", "Q: Cant install Ruby on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS Can't install Ruby via\nsudo apt-get install ruby-full\n\nThe following packages have unmet dependencies :\nRuby, ruby-dev, libtcltk-ruby,  ri\nE: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages. \n## your rights to use the software.

For my needs that's OK, since I'm just developing a simple proof-of-concept app\n\nSo 'embedding the image in the binary' sounds like exactly what I want to do.\nCan anyone run through how to do this with me?\nJust to note, I have attempted a number of 'stab in the dark' attempts at this.\n\n*\n\n*Added a .qrc file (which appears to be the solution for a 'qml with C++' app) but access via source: \":/Pics/testpic.png\" or source: \"qrc:/Pics/testpic.png\" resulted in the same Cannot open: file etc.\n\n\n*Also tried adding the folder in the project pane on the left of the SDK. It showed up under \"extra files\" but still seems to not be accessible when deployed to armhf device.\nAny help with this would be very much appreciated.\n\nEdit: A Quick Outline of Where I went Wrong...\nThanks to koukouviou for steering me onto the right path.\nMy main problem was that I started a QML App with Simple UI(qmake) project. I put it together and tested it by deploying to the Desktop and when I was happy enough with it I tried deploying to an armhf Device. It was then that I found that the images wouldn't show.\nI had no C++ code in my project so it seemed unnecessary to be using any of the 'C++' project Templates, so I made some attempts to 'fix' my problem but I was still using the 'QML App with Simple UI' project Template.\nAdding a QT Resource file to a QML App with Simple UI project looks like it should work: the .qrc file can be added and populated with your images but any reference to source: \"qrc:/Pics/testpic.png\" failed.\nAs far as I am aware it is not possible to use your own Image files with a 'QML App with Simple UI' and deploy it to an armhf Device.\nAfter reading koukouviou's answer I finally thought I'd just have to bite the bullet and start a project using C++ code. This time I chose QtQuick App with QML UI (qmake) which has the description 'Creates a C++ Ubuntu application project with a sample UI containing a Label and a Button'.\nAs previously mentioned, I had avoided this before because I had no C++ code in my application & no real understanding of how to use C++ in this (or any) context, but I was glad to find that it wasn't necessary for me to adjust or add any C++ code and I could just make my changes to Main.qml and add my Image files to the Resources. There was, in fact, already a .qrc resource file in the project tree by default.\n\nA: This is what I did to embed an image in the \"binary\":\nI'm using a qmake project with the default folder structure in Ubuntu SDK. I made a directory to store my images: project_name/backend/your_click/images. With the backend folder I created a new resource file resource_file.qrc that contains the following:\n<!DOCTYPE RCC><RCC version=\"1.0\">\n<qresource>\n    <file>images/bigredbutton.png</file>\n</qresource>\n</RCC>\n\nTo create the qrc file I think you can right-click, Add New ..., Qt, Qt Resource File and manually edit the file, or manually create it from scratch. I don't remember which one worked for me, try them out and let me know, I will edit the answer for others that may run into the same problem in the future.\nIn my Main.qml file I use the image like this:\nImage {\n    id: btn\n    width: 250; height: 250\n    fillMode: Image.PreserveAspectFit\n    source: \"qrc:images/bigredbutton.png\"\n    MouseArea {\n    ...\n    }\n\nHere's a screenshot of my project structure, it might help.\n\n", "Q: How to install google drive on Ubuntu 15.10?

I can open the apps, but neither of them has an effect on the screen color tone. On F.lux, when I try to preview the color temperature, nothing happens. Does anybody know what could be going on here? Why isn't this working?\nNote, I am using an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 980 Ti GPU. \n\nA: I tried to get both f.lux and Redshift to work without any solution so I just opted to go another route. So I went to the Ubuntu Software Manager and installed Night Light slider as pictured below. It works and certainly isn't making me die from strained eyes and a headache from earlier in the evening due to no sleep.\n\n\n*\n\n*Search for Night Light on Ubuntu Software:\n\n\n*Once installed, it just appears in your top right drop down menu and can be toggled to user preference.  \n\n\nA: So I figured out how to use Redshift with my system. Basically, I was using the wrong display driver. When I went to the Additional Drivers tab in the Software & Updates app, I noticed I was using default Nouveau driver instead of the latest NVIDIA driver, and had the other tab set to \"Do not use the device\".\n\nwhen I switched it to the NVIDIA driver tab and HDMA Driver with DKMS Format (daily-dkms) tab, and restarted the machine, it finally worked.\n\n\nA: In a console type\nredshift -l list\n\nthen I typed \nredshift -l geoclue2\n\nthen it just worked.  I can even close and reopen it now and it works fine.\n\nA: Redshift is time-based. It will change the color of your screen provided the following two conditions are met:\n\n\n*\n\n*It can determine where you are (either via the default network-based location service or if you started it with the -l switch giving it coordinates)\n\n*It is evening in your place (you can change the interval with the -t switch, see man redshift)\n\n\nThe f.lux website describes pretty much the same thing:\n\nf.lux fixes this: it makes the color of your computer's display adapt to the time of day, warm at night and like sunlight during the day.\n\n\nA: I'm using Linux Mint 18.2, but it is based on Ubuntu 16.04 and I have many of the same problems pop up, including this one. I just managed to resolve this on my laptop running a GTX 940 on the Nvidia 384.90 Driver and I will test it on my desktop with a 1070 tomorrow.\nAs noted above I ran the following to list the Locations that redshift can use to base it's color:\nredshift -l list\nThen I ran \nredshift -l geoclue2\nwhich allowed me to start the redshift service and everything was working fine. I then moved on to making sure that it worked on startup by opening up 'Startup Applications' and adding the last command as a custom command there. By clicking 'run now' I was able to test that it still worked but also run it as a background service as opposed to directly in the CLI.\n\nA: I just pause the f.lux and then un-pause it, and it worked for me. \n\nA: For me changing the Adjustment Method in the settings menu from drm to randr made it work.\n", "Q: Recommendation for a bluetooth mouse that works without a transceiver with 14.04 I have a Dell E5570 that has only 3 usb ports, and can't afford to devote one to a mouse usb transceiver.

I've read about the blueman bluetooth manager but I can't tell from the documentation whether it will work with 14.04 and if so with which mice.\nThanks very much for any suggestion.\n\nA: If the machine does not have Bluetooth built into it, it will probably need the transceiver.\nAnother option is to purchase a USB hub, which will give you more ports.\nBest bet is, check with Dell as to what mouse they recommend will work with the machine, it really is not an Ubuntu issue per se, at least not yet.\nChris\n", "Q: Can I upgrade my version of Ubuntu from the terminal?

I want to search for a string of text in all files in a directory (and not its subdirectories; I know the -r option does that, but that is not what I want).\n\n\n*\n\n*Running\ngrep \"string\" /path/to/dir\n\nis supposed to be able to do this, I've read, but it gives me the error:\ngrep: dir: Is a directory\n\n*Next, I tried running grep on multiple files.  \ngrep \"string\" .bashrc .bash_aliases works perfectly.  \ngrep \"string\" .bash* works as intended too.  \ngrep \"string\" * gives me the errors:\ngrep: data: Is a directory\ngrep: Desktop: Is a directory\ngrep: Documents: Is a directory\ngrep: Downloads: Is a directory\n...\n\nOnly the errors are printed, I don't get the matching lines. I tried using the -s option, but to no avail.\nSo, my questions:  \n\n\n*\n\n*Why am I not being able to use grep on a directory, as in (1), when I should be able to? I've seen that done in plenty examples on the Internet.\nEdit: When I say \"using grep on a directory\", I mean \"search in all the files in that directory excluding its subdirectories\". I believe that this is what grep does when you pass a directory to it in place of a file. Am I incorrect?  \n\n*Please give me an explanation on the workings of grep that would explain the behavior of commands in (2).\nEdit: Let me be more specific. Why does using wildcards to specify multiple files to search in for work with .bash* and not with * or even ./*?  \n\n*How can I search all the files in a directory (and not its subdirectories) using grep?\n\nA: Old timers would probably do this:\nfind . -type f -print0 | xargs -0 grep \"string\"\n\n\nA: In Bash, a glob will not expand into hidden files, so if you want to search all the files in a directory, you need to specify hidden files .* and non-hidden *.\nTo avoid the \"Is a directory\" errors, you could use -d skip, but on my system I also get an error grep: .gvfs: Permission denied†, so I suggest using -s, which hides all error messages.\nSo the command you are looking for is:\ngrep -s \"string\" * .*\n\nIf you are searching files in another dir:\ngrep -s \"string\" /path/to/dir/{*,.*}\n\n\nAnother option is to use the dotglob shell option, which will make a glob include hidden files.\nshopt -s dotglob\ngrep -s \"string\" *\n\nFor files in another dir:\ngrep -s \"string\" /path/to/dir/*\n\n\n† Someone mentioned that I shouldn't get this error. They may be right - I did some reading but couldn't make heads or tails of it myself.\n\nA: Rephrasing - you want to grep the files in one level of subdirectory, but not recurse though all sub-sub directories?\ngrep forthis  *  */*\n\nOr if you don't want the files in the current directory\ngrep forthis  */*\n\nNote this won't find directories starting with a dot.\ngrep forthis  .*/*    */*   \n\nshould do that job.\nThere's also -maxdepth and -mindepth restriction parameters available to the find command too.\n\nA: You can think like this, for example using grep.\ngrep -l PATH ~/.[^.]*\n\nSo this search for string \"PATH\" listing name of the files below the user's home directory, only for files that start with a dot .  \n/root/.bash_history\n/root/.bash_profile\ngrep: /root/.cache: Is a directory\ngrep: /root/.config: Is a directory\ngrep: /root/.dbus: Is a directory\n\nUsing grep PATH ~/.[^.]* you'll see all occurrence, including line with searching keyword.\n/root/.bash_history:echo $PATH\n/root/.bash_history:echo $PATH\n/root/.bash_history:PATH=$PATH:~/bin\n/root/.bash_history:echo $PATH\n/root/.bash_profile:PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin\n/root/.bash_profile:export PATH\ngrep: /root/.cache: Is a directory\ngrep: /root/.config: Is a directory\ngrep: /root/.dbus: Is a directory\n\nTo get rid of error redirect to /dev/null for example\ngrep PATH ~/.[^.]* 2>/dev/null\n\n/root/.bash_history:echo $PATH\n/root/.bash_history:echo $PATH\n/root/.bash_history:PATH=$PATH:~/bin\n/root/.bash_history:echo $PATH\n/root/.bash_profile:PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin\n/root/.bash_profile:export PATH\n\nSo you can apply this pattern for searching \"Apache\" string in files from /etc directory-looking only in files below this main directory. You see that this don't return from /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf\ngrep Apache /etc/[^.]* 2>/dev/null\n/etc/passwd:apache:x:48:48:Apache:/usr/share/httpd:/sbin/nologin\n/etc/services:derby-repli     4851/tcp                # Apache Derby Replication\n/etc/services:derby-repli     4851/udp                # Apache Derby Replication\n\n\nA: You need the -d skip option added on.  \n\n\n*\n\n*Grep is searching inside of files.  You can search recursively, as you said, if you want to search files inside of a directory.\n\n*By default, grep will read all files, and it detects the directories.  Because by default you have not defined what to do with the directories with the -d option, it give error output.\n\n*Searching just within the parent directory would be grep -d skip \"string\" ./*\n\nA: Here is an example to properly skip directories without hiding all errors (without -s param on chosen answer): \ngrep --directories='skip' 'searchString' *\n\n", "Q: Cannot reboot/shutdown Ubuntu 16.04 I hadn't any problem with 14.04, but 16.04 is so buggy. I can't reboot Ubuntu after installation is completed from live USB/DVD and I must press the power button. Also sudo reboot and sudo poweroff don't work when Ubuntu is booted. I updated Ubuntu but the problem still exists.\n\nA: OK. The first problem (reboot problem after installation was completed) occurred because I set acpi=off during the installation because Ubuntu got stuck in loading purple screen. After many tries I could pass by the purple screen by chance without setting acpi=off! Then after installation, Ubuntu was restarted without any problem.\nThe second problem (shutdown and restart problem after Ubuntu was booted for the first time from hard disk) was because of Nvidia driver.

Today I connected a USB 3.0 flash drive to the USB 3.0 port and I booted Ubuntu with that and the problem was solved (I don't need to wait for a chance or set acpi=off to boot Ubuntu). But unfortunately I am getting a new problem and it is I cannot reboot or shutdown Ubuntu .\n\nA: I had the same problem on my Asus Vivobook n552vw laptop with Windows 10 and Ubuntu dual-booting in UEFI mode.\nFinally I found that Secure Boot was disabled in my UEFI settings.

I am providing Screenshots below  Screenshot showing Installed section which does not contain Amazon \n\nA: Amazon has been installed into the Unity desktop as part of a package called Unity-Webapps-Common.\nYou could if you wanted to, open a terminal window and run the following command:\n$ sudo apt purge ubuntu-web-launchers \n\nHowever, it's not recommended. The unity-webapps-common is a metapackage containing lots of other packages. If you uninstall this application then you will lose other things that you may need.\nInstead, try to remove any files related to amazon manually.\nOpen a terminal window and type in the following commands:\nsudo rm /usr/share/applications/ubuntu-amazon-default.desktop\nsudo rm /usr/share/unity-webapps/userscripts/unity-webapps-amazon/Amazon.user.js\nsudo rm /usr/share/unity-webapps/userscripts/unity-webapps-amazon/manifest.json\n\nSource\n\nA: This worked for me:\nsudo apt-get remove workspacesclient\n\nand then remove any packages left by using:\nsudo apt autoremove\n\n", "Q: How to set atom editor to main editor i have been searching about this topic.

I had to set GDK_DPI_SCALE to 0.5 to counter the effect on the font size.\n\nA: If you want to create a launcher, use the following in the command editor (adapted from Zoltan):\nenv GDK_DPI_SCALE=0.4 env GDK_SCALE=2 eclipse\n\nI'm using it on a 4k 15.6' display.\n\nA: -Dswt.autoScale=exact\n\nworked for me. It apparently used my Gnome Tweak Tool font scaling setting of 1.35 The autoScale options are explained at Tweaking SWT's auto-scaling\n", "Q: Renaming files on Ubuntu-GNOME appears weird instead of blue When I try to rename a folder, the selected content looks weird.

However, one of the hard drives is displaying a SMART error.  I don't remember the exact error, but something to the effect of imminent failure.\nWhat is the process for replacing the drive?  Should I let it ride and let Ceph take care of it when it fails?  Or should I replace the drive before Ceph notices anything?\nI assume it's best to replace the drive before any damage is done, but in the case of using Ceph, I believe it can handle the failure.  I'm not sure if in the JUJU Ceph charm has some magic that will make the replacement process easier one way or another.\nI don't see any degradation in performance.\n\nA: Ceph is designed to remain highly available despite individual failures of hard disks, nodes, or entire racks when a cluster is correctly designed. This is the primary reason for the 3-replica strategy on the data (RAID is not required nor is recommended).\nYou do not need to replace a hard disk before it fails, the standard replacement procedure would be to swap all failed hardware on a scheduled day of the month as part of your operational routine. You of course need to have enough free space in the cluster to accomodate your nominal hardware failure rate, but you need to have free space for other reasons in any enterprise storage system, so that goes without saying.\nOnce the drive fails, Ceph will create new copies of the data that was stored in the corresponding OSD elsewhere in the cluster, and restore the level of resiliency for that data to three replicas. That data is \"degraded\" to two replicas until this completes, but remains highly available as you still have at least two copies of it in the healthy part of the cluster.\n", "Q: Mirror single window Is there a way to mirror a single window on my screens?\nI want to mirror just one window between two screens, not the whole monitor.\nAt the moment I am using Ubuntu 15.10.\n\nA: You can do this with xpra:\nxpra start :100 --start-child=PROGRAM --bind-tcp=0.0.0.0:10000\nxpra attach tcp:localhost:10000\n\nAs a bonus, it also works remotely – you can attach this window to X (or even Windows and MacOS!) on a different machine. xpra is like the console programs screen or tmux for X11.\n", "Q: Texmaker internal pdf viewer deforms document I upgraded to Ubuntu 16.04 lately and reinstalled texlive and texmaker to write in latex. When testing it for a new document I saw that the pdf was not being displayed properly. To clarify the document was shrinked in the vertical direction. When switching to the default ubuntu Document Viewer the pdf was displayed normally which leads me to believe that the document compiles properly (pdfLatex) but the viewer does not display it properly. I didn't have this problem in Ubuntu 14.04 and uninstalling and reinstalling - after reboot - texmaker didn't do anything either.\nAny suggestions?\n\nA: From the research I 've done trying to fix the problem it appears that the upgrade from qt4 to qt5 (which is used to build the package if I get it right) is not working that well. There is a bug report in Ubuntu website about it. (This is what's called regression right?). So I uninstalled again (with dpkg -P) [got some unity executable crash reports from ubuntu for some reason, after every boot]. Then I went to texmaker website and downloaded version 4.5 for Ubuntu 14.04. It needed to install qt4 as dependency and then installed properly. It even made the reboot error go away.\nAs for texmaker pdf's are displaying properly now. Even shortcuts are working - they weren't working as well but hadn't put that here.\nTLDR: Uninstall and install texmaker version that uses qt4 to build because the newer one isn't working properly.\n\nA: I ran into the same problem upgrading from 14.04 to 16.04, running in vmplayer7.  Here are the steps I took. \nYou can download a Texmaker package suitable for your Ubuntu release and architecture from its manufacturer. To install it you need to\n\n\n*\n\n*Remove existing Texmaker packages from your system:\nsudo apt-get remove texmaker texmaker-data\n\n\n*Follow How do I install a .deb file via the command line? to install the downloaded .deb file.\n", "Q: Hiding app icons in 'All' menu Java's installation added six icons to my app menu, which are rather annoying to see every time I open my app launcher menu.

Do do so open a terminal (ctrl+alt+t) and navigate to said directory by:\ncd /usr/share/applications\n\nThere find the corresponding .desktop files and remove them (I highly recommend you take them somewhere else for backing them up, otherwise they will be gone forever and you might need to do a complete remove and new install to get them back), nevertheless heres the command for removing them:\nsudo rm <application>.desktop\n\nIf you want to move them instead use this command:\nsudo mv <application>.desktop /path-to-a-backup-folder/\n\nNote: You will have to reboot to make those changes take effect\n", "Q: Vimeo video not playing in firefox Videos on vimeo don't play in firefox (nor embedded, nor directly on vimeo site).\nThey load.

Another more elegant option is to put it in a script like this one so it is only run on startup.\n", "Q: radeon r9 270 boots only in safe mode I have Kubuntu 16.04, so radeon driver only, my old graphics card is working fine, but my new r9 270 doesn't boot.

I booted from DVD and pressed Try Ubuntu Without Installing and my monitor blacked out. I did a clean install of Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and everything is working perfectly fine. I highly recommend going with 14.04 LTS and not 16.04 LTS.\nEDIT: By the way, Kubuntu 16.04 and Ubuntu 16.04 are the same thing, except Kubuntu uses the KDE desktop environment.

I am trying to remove wine and all of its remnants. When I use    dpkg-query -l '*wine*'    it tells me I have rc wine-staging-i version 1.9.10 with i386 architecture installed, but when I try to remove it outputs    E: Unable to locate package wine-staging-i    . I am running ubuntu 14.04 on a samsung chromebook with an intel processor. I'm sure it's obvious, but I'm super new to all of this and have no idea what I'm doing. I just trial and error-ed myself to this point. I apologize for any formatting or phrasing errors.\n\nA: Simply type in sudo apt-get remove wine and let it uninstall wine. If there is a package in your machine that is truly installed called wine-staging-i simply type in sudo apt-get remove wine-staging-i and it will remove that package.\nIf it claims that wine-staging-i is not apparent on your machine... it means it isn't.\nYou can also use Systemback - A free program for Ubuntu 14.04 that allows you to backup your files, and even restore your system.\nTry restoring your system to a point it was before you installed Wine.\nAlso, type in sudo apt-get remove playonlinux - A lot of users install PlayOnLinux carelessly alongside Wine, so please remove that as well (Optional).\n\nA: I had a similar problem. \n1st, Please note that \"WINE\" is a completely different program from \"Wine Staging.\"   In fact they each have their own versions  & updates. \nWith that in mind, 1st check to see exactly what WINE you have installed.\n[from terminal] \nWINE --version \nIn my case I had:\nwine-2.21 (Staging)\nTo REMOVE it: \nsudo apt-get --purge remove wine-staging\nGeneral rule of thumb:\nIf you see elsewhere (as I've seen) instructions on removing \"WINE\" or other Linux programs, ju substitute \"WINE\" or \"WINE-staging\" depending upon exactly what you have.\n", "Q: apache2 is using different directory than what it should be I have a default Debian installation of Apache2, but when I attempted to change the file at /var/www/html/index.html, nothing happened, because for some reason apache is using the file at /usr/share/apache2/default-site/index.html instead.\nHow do I make apache use the files at /var/www/html ?\nThank you!\nEDIT: Turns out, apache was working properly. I just didn't realize that I logged out of my server, and was actually editing my local machine's files.\n\nA: You can change the location in the /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf file.

It also does the same thing on other sites with other video players, but I figure this is one of the more well known ones.\nAny help?\n\nA: As others have stated, the main problem is ffmpeg library. To fix that, install Chromium and then copy the ffmpeg.so file that Chromium uses. You can do it like this:\nsudo cp /snap/chromium/current/usr/lib/chromium-browser/libffmepg.so /usr/lib/x86-64-linux-gnu/opera/\nAfter that, just restart Opera and the problem will be fixed.\nNOTE: Everytime Opera upgrades, you need to copy ffmpeg.so.\n\nA: Run this command in a terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T):\nsudo apt-get install chromium-codecs-ffmpeg-extra\n\nThen restart Opera.\n\nA: If you are having trouble with videos on the web that are not flash, it is probably a video that uses the H.264 codec.   In the past chromium-codecs-ffmpeg-extra has resolved this (and might again) Unfortunately, Opera has some issues with using the library sometimes, because it's so tightly integrated with chromium. There is no 100% good solution of getting H.264 support in Opera right now.\nBasically Opera is having trouble with the licensing. The library that provides many codecs that Opera uses is called ffmpeg. However, they have removed the H.264 part of it, because even though ffmpeg has a free license, the patent pool of H.264 will demand license fees from commercial projects that are using implementations of it, like Opera.\nChromium and Chrome, however, do have support for H.264 in their ffmpeg library, because Google has payed the license fee.\nSwitching to Google Chrome or perhaps Chromium is highly likely to resolve this issue entirely.(it did for me on both Ubuntu 14.04 and 16.04 - 64-bit) \nThe only other option I can suggest even trying is the installation of the Ubuntu Resticted Extras Package Available in the [multiverse repository] which is defined as Unsupported, Closed-Source and Patent-Encumbered Software:\nFor more on the multiverse repository and how and whether to enable it see this excellent Q & A\nSources:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/OperaBrowser\nWhat's the difference between multiverse, universe, restricted and main?\n\nA: Get the ffmpeg number (XXXXXX) needed:\nThe XXXXXX revision number to choose depends on the chrome version of your opera\n\n*\n\n*Check chrome ver. in Help / About / Browser identification\n\n\n*Chrome version to ffmpeg XXXXXX number\nOpera installed from .deb (or apt)\n# 1. make backup of opera ffmpeg\nsudo mv /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/opera/libffmpeg.so /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/opera/libffmpeg.so_orig\n\n# 2. install codecs\nsudo snap install chromium-ffmpeg \n\n# or check if codecs are already installed\nsnap list | grep chromium-ffmpeg\nsnap refresh # to update snaps\n\n# 3. find files\nfind /snap/chromium-ffmpeg/ -name \"libff*\"\n\n# example output:\n#/snap/chromium-ffmpeg/[YY]/chromium-ffmpeg-[XXXXXX]/chromium-ffmpeg/libffmpeg.so\n\n# 4. symlink (don't use [], just the YY XXXXXX numbers)\n\nsudo ln -sf /snap/chromium-ffmpeg/[YY]/chromium-ffmpeg-[XXXXXX]/chromium-ffmpeg/libffmpeg.so /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/opera/\n\n# 5.

Does the variable turn back at the moment I exit?\n\nA: For the program that you started with nohup, no, the variable won't be reset because you logged out (unless it's a program that watches for you logging out and then resets the variable, or some such weirdness).\nEach process has its own copy of environment variables. For a process X, other processes cannot typically change X's copy of variables without X's cooperation. This is also why a script cannot change the current shell's variables unless it is sourced.\nSo, once you start the process, it gets a copy of OMP_NUM_THREADS. What you then do in your shell (including setting OMP_NUM_THREADS to another value, logging out, starting another shell, sacrificing to Cthulhu) won't affect X's environment variables.\n", "Q: Access is denied because the NTFS volume is already exclusively opened I'm trying to mount a drive with:\nsudo mount -t ntfs /dev/sda1 usb\n\nI get this error:\nMount is denied because the NTFS volume is already exclusively opened.\nThe volume may be already mounted, or another software may use it which\ncould be identified for example by the help of the 'fuser' command.\n\nI use:\nfuser -m /dev/sda1\n\nand get back a huge list:\n/dev/sda1:               1rce     2rce     3rce     5rce     7rce     8rce     9rce    10rce    11rce    12rce    13rce    15rce    16rce    17rce    18rce    20rce    21rce    22rce    23rce    25rce    26rce    27rce    28rce    29rce    30rce    31rce    32rce    33rce    34rce    35rce    36rce    37rce    38rce    39rce    43rce    44rce    45rce    46rce    62rce    63rce    67rce    68rce    69rce    70rce    71rce    72rce    73rce    74rce    75rce    76rce    77rce    78rce    79rce    80rce    81rce    82rce    83rce    84rce    85rce    86rce    87rce    88rce    89rce    90rce    95rce   108rce   109rce   151rce   152rce   157rce   158rce   159rce   160rce   161rce   162rce   163rce   164rce   165rce   166rce   167rce   168rce   175rce   177rce   262rce   264rce   265rce   294rce   307rce   425rce   527rce   566rce   567rce   598rce   683rce   724rce   725rce   726rce   727rce   728rce   810rce   819rce   824rce   827rce   830rce   832rce   836rce   837rce   850rce   863rce   868rce   893rce   897rce   909rce   911rce   944rce   949rce   962rce   979rce   996rce  1026rce  1029rce  1037rce  1038rce  1039rce  1040rce  1041rce  1042rce  1102rce  1229rce  1268rce  1285rce  1323rce  1395rce  1405rce  1413rce  1419rce  1428re  1507rce  1515rce  1527re  1554re  1559rce  1564rce  1585rce  1596rce  1598rce  1602re  1604re  1605re  1607re  1620re  1647rce  1649re  1654re  1656re  1660re  1664re  1665re  1672re  1675re  1680re  1700rce  1703re  1712rce  1728re  1729re  1730re  1736re  1739re  1741re  1742re  1743re  1747re  1798re  1807rce  1809rce  1814re  1856re  1862re  1863re  1877rce  1889rce  1901rce  1907rce  1912rce  1920rce  1928rce  1938rce  1949rce  2067rce  2077rce  2079rce  2097rce  2141rce  2148re  2157re  2164rce  2168rce  2175rce  2200rce  2202rce  2211rce  2314re  2316re  2337rce  2458re  2635re  2671rce  3023re  3041re  3696rce  4095rce  4370rce  4422rce  4782rce  4800rce  4915rce  4922rce  5012rce  5015rce  5053re  5060rce  7686rce  7809rce 13428rce 14203rce 14204rce 14208rce 14283rce 28222rce 28282rce 28284rce 28285rce 28370rce 28372rce 28373rce 28382rce 28383rce 28385rce 28511rce 28521rce 28550rce 28578rce 28591rce 28593rce 28595rce 28633rce 28857rce 28897rce 28910rce 28972rce 28997rce 29092rce 29152rce 29153rce 29226rce\n\nNot sure what's happening.

This is not done automatically by FFmpeg, but must be done at the application level (check for example the ffmpeg_vdpau.c file used by ffmpeg.c). Also, note that with this API it is not possible to move the decoded frame back to RAM, for example in case you need to encode again the decoded frame (e.g. when doing transcoding on a server).\nSeveral decoders are currently supported through VDPAU API in libavcodec, in particular H.264, MPEG-1/2/4, and VC-1. \nThe output of mediainfo videofile should shed some light on whether the codec in use is supported, however the FFMpeg IMplementations table in the aforementioned documentation indicates that VDPAU is deprecated for technical reasons and should not be used.  \nI have nothing further to add, but hope this information is useful all the same.\n", "Q: Videos Play with twice the normal speed, no sound I just installed Ubuntu 14.04 on my Lenovo Ideapad 500 laptop, and I have the problem that all my multimedia files( YouTube, VLC , RhythmBox) are playing at twice the normal speed, with no sound.

This will depend on whether or not you used all the drive space for your current OS. The Ubuntu installer can do this for you and installation is pretty much the same as if you were installing Ubuntu on its own. You would be best selecting \"something else\" at the installation type partition screen so you can configure the partitions how you need them.\nAssuming your using standard partitions and don't intend to share them between the different OS's the main decision you have is whether to use the boot loader you currently have or the one Ubuntu will install. If you want to use the current one, ensure the boot loader in Ubuntu is installed to the root partition (such as sda1, sdb1, etc) rather than the drive (sda or whichever drive your using). If you're OK with Ubuntu overwriting the current boot loader then install the boot loader to the drive sda, sdb, etc. This is selected during the partition configuration screen you will have used above.\nIf you go with keeping your current boot loader, you will have to boot into your current OS after you have installed Ubuntu and update the boot loader so that it finds and includes Ubuntu in the boot selection screen. If you go with the Ubuntu one, it should find and include your current OS during installation.\nHope that helps and good luck.\n", "Q: What is the lastest stable kernel and how to install it?

That's an incompatibility. The install source device (sdc) and the target (to install to) device MUST have the same partitioning scheme in order for GRUB to install correctly. It can be MBR --> MBR, or GPT --> GPT, but NOT MBR --> GPT or GPT --> MBR.\nJudging by the size (and Win7) of your internal disk, i assume you have an older PC that just might not support UEFI and GPT. It is most likely a BIOS PC who only supports MBR.\nThe safest solution would be to erase sdc and create an MBR scheme to it. Then create a Ubuntu liveUSB on it. Easiest way to do that would be by using Rufus under Windows and selecting BIOS scheme for your usb thumb. And then reinstall Ubuntu.\n\nA: Boot into Windows and download and install EasyBCD. Run it, and click \"BCD Deployment, click \"Write MBR\" and then  install BCD on your Windows partition (This case NTFS Partition 4). Now go to \"Add New Entry\" and select your Windows partition, then click \"Add Entry\". Next, go to the Linux tab and select GRUB2 and select \"Automatically Locate and Load\" then \"Add Entry\". You should now be able to boot Windows and Linux painlessly.\n", "Q: Characters not displayed in UI after waking from suspend : Ubuntu 16.04 I am getting this second day in row after waking up PC from suspend:\n\nTried compiz --replace but all system hanged up.\nAnybody knows how to fix it?\nRunning Ubuntu 16.04 with all latest updates on Lenovo T440p.\nUPDATE:\nThis happens only if I forget to turn off sshuttle and/or cos (snx).

I installed two packages but the last one didn't. So I want to uninstall the first package. In this link I have described what was my problem. my problem\n\nA: To uninstall a package installed with dpkg:\nsudo dpkg -P name-of-package\n\nor\nsudo apt-get remove --purge name-of-package\nsudo apt-get autoremove\n\nTo get the name of the package first:\ndpkg -l | grep part-of-package-name\n\nin your case\ndpkg -l | grep linux-headers\n\nwhich is what you installed. The actual kernel is the linux-image package - the linux-headers are minimal configuration kits to automatically build the kernel and its modules, so it is not really important to remove them as they won't do anything to your system by themselves & won't affect which kernel is used.\nTo find actual installed kernels to remove them, first check what kernel is running with uname -r and do not remove it. Then run:\ndpkg -l | grep linux-image\n\nIf you have removed an installed kernel you should run\nsudo update-grub\n\nafterwards, to remove it from the GRUB menu.\n", "Q: How to specify additional search domains for resolver in 16.04 GUI network settings when using DHCP? With Gnome Ubuntu 14.04, it was possible to specify additional search domains for the resolv.conf, when editing a network connection, like so:\n\nBut where do I find this field for the \"additional search domains\" in Ubuntu 16.04?\nIs the only \"real\" way to modify /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/base or /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/head? Is there no GUI way to do this?\n\nA: In Ubuntu GNOME 16.04, you are correct that the ability to edit or add additional search domains is unavailable, but this is only true for the 'default' network editing system that you see.  This 'newer' one was put in place, according to Jeremy Bicha in the #ubuntu-gnome IRC chat channel on Freenode, because the default editor in Settings should be easier to use for most end-users:\n\njbicha: sorry it's hidden by default because most people don't need two network GUIs and the one in the Settings app should be easier to use for most people\n\nAnd of course you can't see search domains in the default editor:\n\nHowever, the original network editing GUI is still available.  Just run nm-connection-editor.  This will launch the same, good-old Network Manager editing window that you expect to see.  That has the ability to do search domains.  (Thanks to the #ubuntu-gnome IRC channel on Freenode for this!)\n\nThis procedure/answer also works in 18.04 and 20.04 as well (tested myself).\n\nA: This was driving me mad in 16.04, then I managed to follow the instructions that I found here, and they seemed to work.\nhttps://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/17843\nIt does look like a hack though and it's certainly not a \"GUI\" way.\n\nA: Beside updating or downgrading your Ubuntu and/or network manager, the only GUI solution i can think about is WICD (link to Ubuntu Community Wiki) \n", "Q: How to solve simg2img error \"Invalid sparse file format at header magi\"?

So, there is this bug, which is critical to our production systems (#1246245 - proftpd fails to restart after logrotate). It makes ProFTPd terminate every few days and I have to restart it. Of course I can apply the patch manually on every production machine we are spinning up, but there should be a simpler way: Just patch it.\nThe bug is confirmed and has a (one-line!) patch since October 2013. But nobody wants to do it. I've commenting on the bug daily for a week now and even wrote a mail to the maintainer (which is the \"ProFTPD Maintainance Team\"). Fixing the bug should take 5 minutes. But nobody cares.\nSo my question is: Given there is a bug, but nobody fixes it, how do I get the developers to do it?\n\nA: Unless you're a paying customer who is paying a service contract for 24/7 service, I'm not so sure if posting a message daily is something you should do or something you should be proud of.  The bug has gone unfixed for 3 years -- that's nothing; I've seen longer than that.  I've also see new software versions getting released that make old bug reports irrelevant (i.e., technically, the code is never fixed because the program is rewritten from the ground up).\nRather than posting here daily in the hope of getting some attention, here are some more constructive suggestions:\n\n\n*\n\n*The upstream site actually has source code in a git repository (http://www.proftpd.org/git.html).  Clone it from there, patch it yourself, and then run this instead of the Ubuntu package.\n\n*Consider other ftp servers.

Surely some \"mission-critical\" problems might use commercial software just so they can get service when they want it.\n\n\nActually, maybe ignore the first point.\nI just noticed that the problem is in a script and not the program's source code.  Why can't you edit the script yourself?  Sure, it's inconvenient, but with the time you've already spent on it, I think you could have done it already...\n(In the bug report, you said you don't have write access?

The vast majority of \"outdated\" extensions work normally after modifying the metadata.json file, so I want to download it anyway, fix it and have a working extension in 2 seconds, but this website doesn't even let me download the zip with extension files, because apparently it thinks that I'm too stupid to add 1 line to the metadata.json file.\nIs there a way to force it to give me that file? I think I've seen a way to do this a few months ago by downloading some JSON file, which contains the URL of the zip file, but I don't remember how to do that and I can't find it anywhere.\n\nA: Maybe it did not work like this back in 2016, but to download an unsupported version of the extension, select a version of Gnome Shell in the dropdown next to \"Download\". A second drop down will appear with the label \"Extension version...\" that allows you to select a specific version of the extension.

It is easy to add and change languages in Ubuntu with the default Unity desktop environment.\nYou just have to to Languages & Support -> Install / Remove Languages... and add which ever you want.\nHow can I do the same in Ubuntu GNOME 16.04? \n\nAdding Input Sources without adding corresponding language results in unsupported characters :\n\n\nA: Actually, Region & Language in Ubuntu GNOME does basically the same as Language Support (language-selector-gnome) when it comes to adding languages, even if the UIs differ. However, you are right about Kannada - for some (to me unknown) reason it's available as a language in Language Support, but not in Region & Language.\nWhen you add a language, some language support is installed besides the translations, including extra fonts if applicable. So it's advisable to install the language first if you are about to add an input source for some non-latin script. This is true for both Ubuntu GNOME and other flavors.\nWith that said, and even if Language Support is not installed by default in Ubuntu GNOME, it's compatible with Ubuntu GNOME, and can be useful as a supplement occationally.\n\nA: Since the idea with Ubuntu GNOME is to provide GNOME software, the default tool is Region & Language.\nTo get Language support, the package language-selector-gnome has to be installed.\nSo install language-selector-gnome to add and change languages in the way you used to do.\nExecute : sudo apt install language-selector-gnome. \nNow any language can be added and configured as usual.\n \n\nA: It is inadvisable on GNOME to install the language-selector-gnome as it is a Unity tool and manages to interfere with the pre-installed system for dealing with language packs and input sources (especially with the IBus).\nThe built-in method to install additional language packs (and you have to install the language pack before you can add the input source) is as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to the Region & Language section of the gnome-control-center:\n\n\n\n\n\n*Click on Language in order to get the language selection up:\n\n\n\n\n\n*Click the button at the bottom to offer more languages than the currently install ones:\n\n\n\n\n\n*In the search box at the bottom search for the language you want to install.\n\n*Select the language(s) you wish to install (a tick will appear next to the selected languages) and then click Done.\n\n*After doing so a box similar to do this one will appear, check that you are happy with what will be installed and then click Install, you will be prompted for authentication and may get another installation box on which you should also click Install if you get it:\n\n\nNote: If there is a language that you find can only be installed properly for some reason through the language-selector-gnome install it through there but after doing so purge the language-selector-gnome, then you will get the language pack you want, but the program won't interfere with your system.\n", "Q: SSH from Ubuntu to Lubuntu on a local network I want to SSH from my laptop to a device on my local network running Lubuntu.

Then open a terminal on your Ubuntu machine and type ssh user@ipaddress(or host name) and then type in the password for the user. Alternatively you can setup a private key for your Ubuntu machine and upload the public key to your lubuntu machine, eliminating the need for entering a password.\n\n\n*\n\n*ssh-keygen\n\n*Leave pass phrase blank or enter one. Entering one is more secure.\n\n*ssh-copy-id user@ipaddress\n\n*Enter password for user\n\n*Enter pass phrase if created\n\n\nFrom then on, you will only need to type ssh user@ipaddress to log on to your server.

The simplest fix for this problem is to create a file in the templates folder:\ntouch `xdg-user-dir TEMPLATES`/Empty\\ Text\\ File.txt\n\nIt's definitely a bug as stated.\n\nA: In the case you are using an ubuntu with a different language that english, first check where your Templates folder is. \nvi ~/.config/user-dirs.dirs\n\nAnd in this file, check for XDG_TEMPLATES_DIR=. In spanish for example you will have something like:\nXDG_DESKTOP_DIR=\"$HOME/Escritorio\"\nXDG_DOWNLOAD_DIR=\"$HOME/Descargas\"\nXDG_TEMPLATES_DIR=\"$HOME/Plantillas\"\nXDG_PUBLICSHARE_DIR=\"$HOME/Público\"\nXDG_DOCUMENTS_DIR=\"$HOME/Documentos\"\nXDG_MUSIC_DIR=\"$HOME/Música\"\nXDG_PICTURES_DIR=\"$HOME/Imágenes\"\nXDG_VIDEOS_DIR=\"$HOME/Vídeos\"\n\nThen you can apply the solution listed in the other answers:\nmkdir ~/Plantillas  (or the name listed before)\ntouch ~/Plantillas/Documento\\ de\\ Texto.txt\n\nAnd that is all. \n\nA: this method didn't quite work for me, items in the Templates folder weren't showing up in the context menu.  something needed to be restored about how the system identifies and uses the Templates folder.  \nto fix this, i installed ubuntu tweak like so:\nwget -q -O - http://archive.getdeb.net/getdeb-archive.key | sudo apt-key add -\nsudo sh -c 'echo \"deb http://archive.getdeb.net/ubuntu xenial-getdeb apps\" >> /etc/apt/sources.list.d/getdeb.list'\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-tweak\n\nand then used this method, namely, delete your Templates folder and then use this method to 'restore' the Templates folder, worked for me in 17.04 on a thinkpad t530:\nHow can I restore template functionality after having deleted the Templates folder in 12.10?\n\nA: You can go into your ~/Templates folder and create templates yourself, then they will appear in the right-click menu. For example:\ncd Templates\n\ntouch Filename.txt\n\n\nA: *\n\n*See if you have ~/Templates folder2. Create one if it is missing using command: \nmkdir ~/Templates\n\n\n*Now create an empty file from command prompt:1\ntouch ~/Templates/Text\\ File.txt\n\nThe \"Create Document\" option is back again and you can create a new text file or a new document.\n1 The backslash is used to tell the shell that the space following it is part of the filename. Since the shell recognizes spaces as delimiters between commands/options/arguments, unless you \"quote it\", 'quote it', or quote\\ it, the shell will treat whatever comes after the space as a separate argument.\n2 The ~/Templates folder is localized, change his name accordingly to your localization (ex: ~/Modèles for French localization).\n\nA: This functionality has been removed from Nautilus 3.20 (either by error or on purpose). There is a bug report on it here. If it turns out to be a bug it will be fixed upstream and then will either be back in 3.22 or backported into 3.20, or if this has been done on purpose then as you can see from the LP bug report they are wanting to make it a distro specific patch.\n\nA: You can also use the LibreOffice 'Save As' feature to save an empty Document, Spreadsheet, Presentation or Drawing in the same way. Using touch to create files won't work (didn't for me anyway) since ubuntu still recognises them as text files.\nSo you can have any type of new file available if you set up the right template for it, not just text files.\n", "Q: Apache reverse proxy couchpotato, nzbget, and sonarr, alternate http and https port I am having issues setting up a reverse proxy with ssl enable and also Apache authentication.

But it is asking me to format the drive before use[image3]. So I want to backup all data in the drive. What should I do? or is there any way to recover the whole drive with the data ?\n\n\n\nA: I'm assuming the F: Drive is now in Liunx 83 format which windows cannot read, you'll need a 3rd party program in order access the files in that partition. Personally I like to use Linux reader, after you install the program, just copy the files from F: Drive to your windows partition and re-format the drive. \nAlternatively you could pop in a Linux live usb and Copy the files from the F: Drive to your windows partition.\n\nA: If the F: Drive is in Linux 83 format (which I agree that it is), you can boot Ubuntu from USB or CD and run GParted to read it.

It starts happening as soon as I use an Fn Key for the first time while running Ubuntu (I have also tested the issue on Arch and it's even worse there).\nUbuntu seems to think there was a brightness up / down keypress randomly (Fn + Up arrow or Fn + Down arrow) even when I am not touching the laptop's keyboard. When I turn the laptop off it shows as if a key was pressed.\nI would not mind not being able to use any Fn Key (even though it'd be preferable if they were enabled) as long as I can stop this brightness issue.\n\nA: This seems to be a common problem on most MSI laptops, including my own GP62 6QF Leopard Pro.

I asked around and was notified of a fix for SwayWM, specifically disabling input events from the \"Video Bus\".\nFirst, one must run swaymsg -t get_inputs to get the identifier for the \"Video Bus\". Example output for the part in question looks like this:\n...\nInput device: Video Bus\n  Type: Keyboard\n  Identifier: 0:6:Video_Bus\n  Product ID: 6\n  Vendor ID: 0\n  Active Keyboard Layout: English (US)\n  Libinput Send Events: enabled\n...\n\nYou have to get the \"Identifier\" entry, which will be used in .config/sway/config to disable input from the \"Video Bus\". In my case, it was 0:6:Video_Bus.\nThe final thing to do is to add the following line to your .config/sway/config:\ninput 0:6:Video_Bus events disabled\n\nSo if your identifier is different, you would replace 0:6:Video_Bus with yours.\nAll that's left is to reload sway's config with $mod+Shift+c or restart sway, and sway should have disabled input from the \"Video Bus\".\n\nA: If you're using KDE Plasma with wayland, you need to use D-Bus to disable Video Bus input.\nFirst you need to find which events correspond to Video Bus, run this command and look at the handlers\ncat /proc/bus/input/devices | grep \"Video Bus\" -A 5\n\nExample output, in this example it's event3:\nN: Name=\"Video Bus\"\nP: Phys=LNXVIDEO/video/input0\nS: Sysfs=/devices/LNXSYSTM:00/LNXSYBUS:00/PNP0A08:00/device:14/LNXVIDEO:00/input/input4\nU: Uniq=\nH: Handlers=kbd event3 \nB: PROP=0\n\nThen call the D-Bus to disable it, (replace event3 with the correct event on your laptop)\nqdbus org.kde.KWin /org/kde/KWin/InputDevice/event3 org.kde.KWin.InputDevice.enabled false\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu on vagrant and iptables I have an ubuntu desktop 14.04 running on a vagrant VM (virtualbox).\nI am trying to forward port 25 to port 2525 and I have executed the following commands:\nsudo sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward=1\nsudo iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i eth0 -p tcp --dport 25 -j REDIRECT --to-port 2525\nsudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -j MASQUERADE\n\nThe command:\ncat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward\n\nreturns 1.\nI can open a connection on port 2525:\nvagrant@vagrant:~$ telnet localhost 2525\nTrying ::1...\nConnected to localhost.\nEscape character is '^]'.\n220 alfresco.com ESMTP SubEthaSMTP 3.1.6\n\nbut telnet on port 25 does not work:\nvagrant@vagrant:~$ telnet localhost 25\nTrying ::1...\nTrying 127.0.0.1...\ntelnet: Unable to connect to remote host: Connection refused\n\nI tried also to connect to the local ip of the machine with same results.\ntelnet 10.0.2.15 2525\nis ok, but\ntelnet 10.0.2.15 25\nreturns the same (connection refused).\nThe command:\niptables -t nat -L\n\nreturns:\nChain PREROUTING (policy ACCEPT)\ntarget     prot opt source               destination         \nREDIRECT   tcp  --  anywhere             anywhere             tcp dpt:smtp redir ports 2525\nREDIRECT   tcp  --  anywhere             anywhere             tcp dpt:2526 redir ports 2525\n\nChain INPUT (policy ACCEPT)\ntarget     prot opt source               destination         \n\nChain OUTPUT (policy ACCEPT)\ntarget     prot opt source               destination         \n\nChain POSTROUTING (policy ACCEPT)\ntarget     prot opt source               destination         \nMASQUERADE  all  --  anywhere             anywhere            \n\nUpdate \nIt would be enough for me if someone can suggest at least how to troubleshoot this kind of problems.\n\nA: You could use socat:\nsocat TCP-LISTEN:25,su=nobody,fork,reuseaddr TCP-CONNECT:127.0.0.1:2525\n\nThis tells socat to listen on TCP port 25 and connect it to local 2525.

But apt itself is now working. So to get my system back to a working state, I had to explicitly install the specific versions of all the broken packages from the toolchain-r ppa, like here:\nsudo apt install {gcc-5-base,cpp-5,g++-5,gcc-5,libasan2,libgcc-5-dev,libstdc++-5-dev,libmpx0}=5.4.0-6ubuntu1~16.04.12\n\nThis then let apt downgrade and finally lead package system to a consistent state.\n\nA: the only thing you have to do is copying /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libstdc++.so.6 from the normal 16.04 ubuntu.\nThis is the most simplest way.\n", "Q: Unable to boot into Windows 10 on dual boot Ubuntu/Windows 10 When I set Windows as the first boot option in BIOS it boots into Windows normally, and the same goes for Linux.

I understand there are a lot of questions regarding this topic of MBR partitions, GPT for UEFI, having dual OS, one with MBR and the other with GPT, but due to my own inexperience I cannot figure this out.\nI have an USB drive. It has a full installation of Elementary OS, which is a close distro to Ubuntu, using MBR to boot ONLY from CSM UEFI and actual Legacy BIOS systems. I want to use it across different systems, some of them use UEFI, others UEFI + Legacy, CSM...\nIs it possible to have two partition tables, MBR and GPT on the same USB stick which point to the same OS so it can be booted from UEFI and Legacy systems? If it is, How can this be archieved?\n\nA: Strictly speaking, a disk can use MBR or GPT, but not both. That said, there's an ugly and dangerous hack, known as a hybrid MBR, which is most often used on Macs, that enables a GPT disk to include MBR pointers to three of its partitions for the benefit of GPT-unaware OSes. There's very little or no reason to use a hybrid MBR except on Macs that are dual-booting with Windows 7 or earlier, or with other non-GPT/non-EFI OSes. A hybrid MBR would provide NO benefit for your specific case.\nBe aware that boot mode (EFI/UEFI vs. BIOS/CSM/legacy) and partition table type (GPT vs. MBR) are not necessarily linked. Windows ties the two together, and older OSes understand neither EFI nor GPT, but other than that, you're usually free to mix and match. You can install Ubuntu in BIOS mode to a GPT disk, for instance. That said, using GPT for EFI-mode booting and MBR for BIOS-mode booting will minimize the risk of running into problems, but it's often possible to cross those boundaries if doing so is necessary. Thus, if you want to have a USB drive that's bootable under either BIOS or EFI, you can, in principle, use either MBR or GPT on it. You'll have to be sure to install both BIOS-mode and EFI-mode boot loaders, but the partition table can be either type. This type of configuration can be tricky to set up, though, and offhand, I don't know of any site that provides step-by-step instructions for configuring it. There are about a million special cases that can create problems for specific computers or for computers configured in particular ways (Secure Boot issues, firmware that's finicky about partition tables, 32- vs. 64-bit systems, etc.). Thus, depending on your needs, it might be better to plan on creating two or more bootable USB drives. Yes, that's more hassle to carry around and keep them straight -- but that hassle may be less than the hassle involved in navigating the mine field of quirks involved in creating a truly universal boot medium.\n\nA: As far as i know, there is NO possibility of having 2 partitioning schemes on the same data storing device. Either MBR or GPT, BUT NOT BOTH at the same time. GPT is an evolution of MBR, but they enumerate data blocks a bit different which is leading to misunderstanding where the partitions are starting and where are ending on the disk. GPT is better because it automatically creates a backup of the partition table at the end of the disk.   \nI personally use two USB sticks: one with MBR, the other with GPT. Some people say that a GPT Ubuntu can boot in BIOS mode. That may be truth, but when installing it to internal drive in BIOS/MBR mode, you will be having BIG trouble with the GRUB not installing correctly, and thus not being able to run the Ubuntu from the hard-drive.  \nSo, you can run it any way you want, but you can't install correctly any way you want. Install from GPT medium to another GPT medium, and from BIOS medium to another BIOS medium. Don't mix them up! \n", "Q: Unable to Use Join Me App We are over 20 developers who use Ubuntu OS very extensively.\nWe use join.me - screen sharing app for our weekly meetings \nwhile providing the presenter role to the UBUNTU user the app fails \ncan you please provide an alternative?\nBest Regards\nIgnatius Rajkumar \n\nA: You can try Google Hangouts.\nIt doesn't need installation.

Depending on the health of your drive, though, it is possible that some data may be lost during a partition resize or move. Even though the installer does nothing more than reallocate the existing free space, it is always a good idea to make a back-up before installing. Generally, it's just always a good idea to make a back-up before doing anything.\n", "Q: Serious(?)

How can I integrate Dropbox into Thunar? I am using Xubuntu 14.04 with Xfce 4.12 installed via PPA, and thunar-dropbox-plugin has been broken. I have also heard that it is not working on Xubuntu 16.04.  \n\nA: Fortunately, Dropbox recently expanded their CLI capabilities to include sharelinks etc. To integrate Dropbox into Thunar do the following:\nInitial Setup\nCreate a ~/bin directory in your home folder if not already created. Download the Dropbox python script. Rename it as just dropbox. (The extension is not needed.) Make it executable chmod +x ~/bin/dropbox.\nIf the ~/bin directory is not already added to your $PATH (i.e. tab completion doesn't work for the script, etc.), you would add the following to ~/.profile. Then log out and in again. \n# set PATH so it includes user's private bin if it exists\nif [ -d \"$HOME/bin\" ] ; then\n    PATH=\"$HOME/bin:$PATH\"\nfi\n\nInstall xsel by pasting sudo apt-get install xsel in terminal. This program gives clipboard functionality to the below script.  \nSave the following script to a plain text file, save it in ~/bin, and make it executable. Mine is named dropbox-online.

Go to Edit > Configure custom actions. Click the plus to add a custom action. Set up the following three custom actions:\n \n \n\nRemember too that you can add your own icon to appear on the Thunar context menu items.\nFor each of these you'll want to do the following on the second tab given that you want to be able to share any type of file or directory. \n\nThe only downside is that the three Dropbox menu items appear globally in Thunar, not only in Dropbox. However, the script tells you if you are accidentally outside of Dropbox.\nUpdate: The command dropbox puburl no longer works. Dropbox no longer has the Public folder for free accounts and discontinues it for paid ones on September 1, 2017.\n\nA: [This should be a comment, apologies but I have not the reputation yet.]\n@jbrock\nThank you! I have found that I need to write for example for the Share Link:\ndropbox-online -s %n\n\nrather than %f, and it seems to be smart enough to work out where in the file system it is.\nAlso, I'm running two dropbox processes; for me I overwhelmingly need it for just one of them, so I have set the HOME env var in lines toward the end of your script:\nHOME=/home/mike/.dropbox-work dropbox sharelink \"$2\" | tr -d '\\n' | xsel -ib && gui_notify \"Share Link Copied\" ;;\n\nWorks well.\n", "Q: Mouse vanishes upon log in Xubuntu I've been having this issue ever since I added an Ubuntu partition alongside Windows 10.When I boot normally its fine(its set so that when I boot I don't have to log in) but when I close the laptop lid I have to unlock it and when I do,the mouse is gone.

I'm expanding my comment into an answer. \nFrom your stated requirements, email is not what you need. You need to transfer text information from 40 instances to one box, collate it, and then feed that information to your DHCP server. \nIn broad strokes, I would set up a machine accessible to the instances with a basic web stack on it, LAMP or even just nginx and a cgi or whatever. Your script then should POST to http://192.168.X.X/scriptName.py. That Python script (or JavaScript if you know that) can then process the incoming text data (IP and whatnot) into a file that yet another script can periodically read and send DHCP lease requests (or whatever) to the DHCP server. \nIt's probably an hour or two of work to set all that up on a Linux box, but if this is a one time set up, it's likely not worth the effort. Just go get the information and send the requests.  If it's more of a \"this is how we set up customer instances on a customer site\" then you'll likely need to build something like this. \n", "Q: New installation: Win10 / Ubuntu Studio 16.04 dual boot and multiple partitions I'm in my 40's and heard the words Linux for years without ever looking into it.  So here I am as green as grass, excited about my new journey.\nFor 2 days straight I've been going around in circles trying to understand installation.  So, without further a do, I'll put my questions out here.\nThis is a new machine with clean installation of Win 10 on a 120 gb ssd m.2.  ASUS z170p mobo, 16gb 2400 DDR4 RAM.  i7 6700.\nAlso have my  1TB SATA HDD  with Win 7 installed on it  (I didn't want to delete it till I knew Win 10 was ok-this drive is partitioned with hundreds of gb's of data on, so simply removing the partition isn't possible; is it ?)\nI have downloaded Ubuntu Studio 16.04 and put it on a 64gb USB 3.0 drive  and plugged into a USB 3.0 port.  I've managed to work out how to change bios etc...\nSo, where am I now ?  I can Live boot to Studio.  I can also live boot directly to install.  My problem is what to do next.  It's taken me a full day to figure out why my interface is different to every single other video installation out out there. (actually I still don't know why my color scheme is different.  Mine is Grey while every other with  I've seen is burgundy/purple/brown? )  I had no option to press the '+' button in the Partition bit to change Primary, Logical, ext4 etc.  Turns out it was because I created a New Volume and formatted in Windows, instead of leaving it.\n\n\n*\n\n*What I would really appreciate is a full on rundown to get this dual booted and installed along Win10 (until i know i can live without it) on my 120gb ssd.  I have already partitioned it down to 30GB for Win 10 leaving around 90GB for Ubuntu. However I may have too many Primary Partitions now! \n\n*Latest problem was Unusable space after i created (/) partition.  I'll make matters worse if I go over everything so I'm not assuming I actually know anything from here on in.\nWould one of you kind people be willing to walk me through this process?\n\nA: actually there are only 4 primary partitions that can be created for any hdd (because of this u have unused space).\nNow,take full backup(i know its hard but this will save you alot) then \"clean\"(windows command) it so that you can create primary partitions where you can dual boot, first windows then ubuntu.\nOne more thing to notice here is if your machine has two drive then one will be the primary drive and there you should install(/) of ubuntu (i.e. grub boot loader replaces windows) helps you in showing boot menu. \n", "Q: Does rng-tools run at startup?

Here's an animated GIF of what I ended up with and how I got it working.\nThe end result\n\nFinding a cursor theme\nWhen I realized that this could be accomplished with a cursor theme (duh!), I went in search of some themes. I eventually ended up here, and after looking through a number of pages of different cursors, I settled on this one. To download, click the files tab and then download the .tar.gz file for the cursor theme.\nInstalling and enabling the cursor for screencasting\nWith the cursor theme downloaded, I got to work on installing it.\n\n\n*\n\n*The file I downloaded contains multiple themes (each a different color halo) so I first extracted the contents to a temp folder\ntar -xzf /path/to/download/160115-bDMZT.tar.gz -C /tmp/\n\n\n*Then I copied the cyan theme to the proper directory, renaming it screencast\nsudo cp -r /tmp/bDMZT/abDMZ/ /usr/share/icons/screencast/\n\n\n*Before enabling the new cursor theme, I made note of the current theme.\nOLD_THEME=$(gsettings get org.gnome.desktop.interface cursor-theme) && echo $OLD_THEME\n\n\n*At this point, all that was left to do was to enable the theme.\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface cursor-theme screencast\n\nIf the new theme is active for some applications but not others or if it does not appear to be active at all, you may need to completely terminate all instances of the applications for which it is not active or log off entirely and log back in.\nChanging back to the default cursor\nOnce you're finished your screencast, you may want to switch back to your previous theme (the system default is DMZ-White). To do this, run:\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface cursor-theme \"$OLD_THEME\"\n\n\nExtra 2-cents\nThere are also programs available to show mouse clicks and key presses which can be really helpful in screencasts.\n\nA: Yellow circle can be done by installing any one of the following software:\n\n\n*\n\n*Cam studio: Is an open source windows software. Install it using wine then go to cursor settings. There is a cursor highlight.\n\n*RealWorld Cursor Editor: Also for Windows. Using this, you can directly edit your mouse properties.\n\n*vokoscreen: To install sudo apt-get install vokoscreen\n\n*cairo-dock there is a add on to highlight the mouse pointer.\n\n*Use gnome-tweak-tool.\n", "Q: How to acces 127 from my server?

Here is what worked for us.\n\n\n*\n\n*Create the .gnupg/S.gpg-agent file as described by ruhri:\n%Assuan%\nsocket=/srv/scratch/joeuser/S.gpg-agent\n\n\n*Add these two lines to the end of .gnupg/gpg-agent.conf (create file if it does not already exist):\nextra-socket /srv/scratch/joeuser/S.gpg-agent.extra\nbrowser-socket /srv/scratch/joeuser/S.gpg-agent.browser\n\n\n*Create the file .gnupg/S.gpg-agent.ssh similar to the file .gnupg/S.gpg-agent:\n%Assuan%\nsocket=/srv/scratch/joeuser/S.gpg-agent.ssh\n\nThis solution comes from this comment.\n", "Q: Problem with cinnamon desktop icons I install cinnamon desktop environment in Ubuntu.

In order to access to a foreign website I used the Ubuntu GUI to created a VPN connection to a foreign server.\nI am wondering how could I access my server via FTP then?\n\nA: \nI used the Ubuntu GUI to created a VPN connection to a foreign server\n\nThis is the wrong way of doing it. A VPS should be managed through SSH and configured properly. Network Manager is not suitable for this because it does not allow for split tunneling. It's an all or nothing approach.\nHow to fix the VPN\n\nHow could I access my server via FTP then?\n\nDisable the VPN in Network Manager. Instead, set up a VPN by routing only traffic to the website and its subdomains. I do it on my VPS as well.\n\n\n*\n\n*Pick up the OpenVPN configuration file provided by your provider and copy its contents to /etc/openvpn/openvpn.conf\n\n*Add this directive to the bottom of the file:\n# No automatic routes\nroute-noexec\n\n\n*Save the file and issue sudo service openvpn restart\nThis will make sure that the VPN is picked up by Systemd and its service located at:\n/lib/systemd/system/openvpn.service\n\nNow you should see the tun0 interface with ifconfig. The VPN is active but no traffic is going through it for now. The last step is making sure you add routes to the domains you need.\n\n\n*\n\n*Found the IP of the website with dig:\ndig +short example.com\n\n\n*Add a route (there are also other approaches, but this one is simple for a few hosts):\nip route add [insert IP here] dev ppp0\n\n\n*Repeat these steps for the www. subdomain and other domains you may need to route through the VPN\nThe routes should be updated once in a while, because the website might change IP address. You can write a Bash script and run it periodically using cron to avoid doing it manually.\nAlternative approach\nIf you are trying to access a geo-restricted video website, e.g. Hulu, you might consider using a SmartDNS service. That will take care of split tunneling for you. You will just need to update the DNS settings on the server.\nHowever, this only works if the SmartDNS provider of your choice supports that particular website.\nConnect to the server\nYou can now connect to your server using its IP address.\n", "Q: Install firefox without locales?

I was always very happy with Firefox and never felt the need to change to Chrome. But Adobe has stopped supporting Flash on Linux and Google has taken over this task. Though Google only supports its Flash for Chrome and not for Firefox.\nIs it now necessary to change from Firefox to Chrome to enjoy safety and functionality regarding Flash?\n\nA: Indeed for the latest flash you will need chrome or chromium with pepperflashplugin-nonfree package (chrome and pepper flash are available for 64bit only).\nHowever firefox uses flash player which is old and it may have bad performance but it still gets some security updates so it can be considered secure enough.\nI always prefer chromium because I believe it's faster  (however with greater ram usage) but both browsers have excellent security.\nJust keep in mind that flash is going to die sooner or later so don't care about it. Most sites use html player instead of flash nowadays (remember that android doesn't support flash at all) and I read somewhere that google plans on blocking flash player on every site by default in a few months (user will have to explicit enable flash in a specific site).\nSo I believe you can still use firefox with no problems at all if you like it.\n\nA: To be clear, Adobe absolutely patches security vulnerabilities in the Firefox Linux 11.2.202.x Flash releases. They just stopped releasing new features. Google's Linux version does both.\nThat said, here's an excerpt from APSA16-01, the emergency Flash security advisory from April:\n\nA critical vulnerability (CVE-2016-1019) exists in Adobe Flash Player 21.0.0.197 and earlier versions for Windows, Macintosh, Linux, and Chrome OS. Successful exploitation could cause a crash and potentially allow an attacker to take control of the affected system.\nAdobe is aware of reports that CVE-2016-1019 is being actively exploited on systems running Windows 10 and earlier with Flash Player version 20.0.0.306 and earlier. A mitigation introduced in Flash Player 21.0.0.182 currently prevents exploitation of this vulnerability, protecting users running Flash Player 21.0.0.182 and later.\n\nI don't know for sure, but it implies that the heap mitigation introduced in 21.0.0.182 was not backported to the Firefox Linux 11.2.202.577 version at the time. Now, it's possible that the exploit could be improved to attack 21.0.0.182 despite the mitigation, and it's likely no one bothered to exploit Linux at all, but it sounds like the Chrome 21.0.0.x series is a harder target.\nPersonally, Firefox is my normal \"daily driver\", but i fire up Chrome when i need to run Flash.\n\nA: I think Firefox is more better then Chrome. \nSo if you needed Flash you can try Chrome, but both for ethical and for features, primarily the security, Firefox has the first position for me!\nWhich site require Flash? If you are talking about YouTube, you can watch it also without it!\n\nA: If you prioritize security, use Firefox. If you're looking for more plugin support, use Google Chrome or Chromium.\nIn my experience, I've found that Firefox errs more on the side of security than does Google Chrome. For example, in the case of early-stage implementations for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing, Firefox operated more strictly than the standard and Chrome operated more loosely than the standard. They are just examples though, these particular issues have already been fixed.\n", "Q: using 9.04 trying to install 16.04 I have been trying to install 16.04 for two long days now. I need help.

I have recently installed clamav, and I think I'd like to use the \"move infected files option\" to move any infected files it finds to my quarantine directory (/virusScan/quarantine, and yes, I own it) in case I miss some. However, I don't want to risk a virus noticing that it's been moved and activating. How can I modify the quarantine directory such that any program moved there cannot execute?\n\nA: You can simply do that by giving the /virusScan/quarantine directory different permissions.\nsudo chmod 664 /virusScan/quarantine\n\nThis way you can read and write to the directory but not execute something from it, the group has as well the same permissions to read and write but not execute and others only can read.\n", "Q: Installing Ubuntu 16.04 on Lenovo Yoga 900S The problem is that Ubuntu doesn't detect the NVM SSD (Samsung 950 PRO). I have also tried Arch and all BIOS options (there aren't much) without any change.\nHas someone a hint?\n\nA: The Yoga 710S, 900, 900S machines do NOT support running Linux out of the box. They were optimised for Windows. The reason your Linux installer cannot see the drive is that the factory BIOS is configured to use a RAID interface to talk to the disk, which is not supported by Linux (or the installer at least).\nFortunately, though, Lenovo have released a separate BIOS, which does support Linux by letting users choose AHCI as the interface controller.\nFor further details, see this thread on the Lenovo Forums.\n", "Q: Why won't chmod +s allow me to do stuff in root's stead?

I can install crouton and go through the process of getting unity up and running (newest version of everything). The track pad at first works, but the pressure you have to apply is ridiculous. When I switch to Chrome OS, it's very light and easy.\nAfter a restart, the trackpad and and keyboard do not work at all in Ubuntu. Everything in Chrome OS is of course, fine.\nLooking for some help!  Has anyone had this problem, or tried this on an Acer Chromebook 14?\n\nA: I freely admit this doesn't directly answer your specific problem but I ran into issues with my Acer Chromebook 14 as well in Unity.  Going with KDE instead worked better.  If you're a Linux noob then switching environments isn't too big of a deal, right?\nTo install KDE, go through the same steps as using crouton for unity but the command to kick it off is sudo sh crouton -t kde instead of -t unity.  \nThe keyboard works fine in KDE but the touchpad is still tricky.  It doesn't need pressure as much as it needs finger surface area (using the pad of your finger rather than tip works).  I'm digging through other Chromebook-touchpad-Linux threads to find a tweak that works to adjust the sensitivity.\nEdit: Okay, I think I found the command to tinker with the touchpad sensitivity.\nxinput set-prop \"Elan Touchpad\" \"Synaptics Finger\" aa bb cc\n\nWhere \"aa\", \"bb\", and \"cc\" are numbers.  Mine had default values of 25, 30, and 0 which seem to translate as \"low\" \"high\" and \"press\" according to some X11 documentation I found.  Using 5 10 50 worked alright for me.  You may need to tweak those numbers.  The important once is the \"bb\" value.  It seems, as soon as it detects a pressure above \"bb\" it counts your finger as on the touchpad.  So if it's not detecting your finger normally, lower \"bb\" until it does.  Keep \"aa\" much much lower and set \"cc\" much, much higher so you can click with a tap.\n\nA: I've just found this question while trying to do find something else, although I think I know a solution to this problem, at least for the track-pad:\nAt a terminal you can use the command synclient FingerLow=1 FingerHigh=3 which should change the sensitivity to make the track-pad feel more normal.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 16.04 Freezes often I just installed Ubuntu 16.04 on a Gigabyte PC.

(If, for example you've forgotten where the shared folder was.

It already has Windows 10 installed in BIOS Support Mode. I made  a LiveUSB and tried to run the installer in legacy mode but it continually craps out on me (black screen with a cursor), so instead I tried running it in UEFI mode. I know that when dual booting it is best to keep the boot modes the same, but I could not get the Ubuntu installer to run in Legacy mode and I figure I can switch between OSes by setting the CSM settings in my motherboard's BIOS whenever I need to.\nThe problem comes up when I get to the actual installation phase of the bootloader. After downloading updated files and beginning the setup, I got following error \nGRUB installation failed\nThe grub-efi-amd64-signed package failed to install into /target/. Without the GRUB boot loader, the installed system will not boot.\" Does this possibly have to do with the fact that I already have an OS installed into BIOS mode? Is there a way to run the installation in Legacy mode without getting a black screen?\nPlease help me; I am at my wit's end. I have tried everything that the forum Q&A's have suggested and still I cannot get my system to boot properly. If there is anyone on here with experience dual booting Linux, feel free to offer your advice. I am an novice in Linux and have not typically had experience with matters of dual booting.\nThanks in advance.\nSpecs: Intel i7-6770K, Nvidia GTX 980 Ti\nAlso, it should be noted that I get an unknown chipset nouveau error whenever I launch the bootloader. I have yet to see an Ubuntu desktop so I wouldn't be surprised if there was a persistent driver problem I have yet to rectify.\n\nA: UPDATE: Since my last post, I have successfully installed Ubuntu GNOME beside Windows 10 on my Dell laptop. For my sake, this confirms that there is nothing wrong with the ISO file or my method of creating a LiveUSB using UNetbootin. However, since Windows 10 was apparently installed in UEFI mode on the laptop, this does not help my mission to install it on my personal rig.\nTo elaborate on my aforementioned issue, when I attempt to boot from USB, I get two options in the BIOS: one that says \"Sandisk UEFI\" and one that is plain \"Sandisk\". Now, obviously, I recognize that selecting the UEFI option will boot me in UEFI mode, but since selecting the text-based Legacy mode invariably hangs on me, I see no other recourse (more on this later). In the UEFI installer, I can continue through the installation process by clicking next (though, selecting \"Install Third Party Software\" in the menus causes it to hang and crash) until I get to the final initialization phase. Here, when it gets to the part wherein it installs GRUB2, I get an error message saying \"GRUB installation failed; The 'grub-efi-amd64-signed' package failed to install into /target/. Without the GRUB boot loader, the installed system will not boot.\". I can only take this to mean that if I already have an operating system installed in BIOS/Compatibility Support mode, I am unable to install a secondary operating system in UEFI mode. If someone would wish to explain this aspect of the process, I more than welcome it.\nNext, when I boot from the plain \"Sandisk\" option in my boot menu, I am presented with a custom UNetbootin text-based bootloader thing instead of the customary GRUB2 menu. From there, I have all the normal options, and can select \"Install Ubuntu\" as one of the options. When I do, the installer appears maladjusted to my screen resolution and hangs as soon as I press the first \"Continue\" button.\nIf I select any other option than \"Install Ubuntu\", I get a black screen and my computer hangs. Selecting \"Try Ubuntu\" invokes this behavior, as well as \"Check disk for defects\".\nI have tried making a LiveUSB of Boot Repair, and I can successfully get a desktop environment and launch the repair tool. Unfortunately, the OS cannot detect my wired Ethernet connection and cannot access the Internet, and so gives me an error message with something along the lines of \"Cannot perform operation without Internet connectivity\". I am not sure how I can proceed with this avenue and welcome suggestions.\nTo the poster above me, I thank you for your instructions for rectifying the NVIDIA driver issue, but since I can view a preliminary GUI environment when launching the bootloader, I believe the more pressing issue is first installing the OS and seeing a desktop environment before worrying about installing propriety drivers.\nAgain, I am still pursue potential solutions. Many sites have suggested I add something before the \"quiet splash\" in the BIOS bootloader but I have tried these to no avail. If it is indeed a driver issue, I would expect Ubuntu would have better support for popular graphics hardware to insure an easier installation method. If dual booting Ubuntu, one of the most popular distros out there, is this difficult on a desktop PC, I can't say I struggle to see why Linux has failed to gain substantial market share in the desktop space (no hate haha).\n\nA: I'm going to talk about the unknown chipset nouveau error first.  nouveau is a set of open source drivers for nvidia.  Back when I installed my ubuntu on a dual boot I was using a GTX 970 and I received the same error.  The problem is that there are currently no open source drivers for your graphics card so Ubuntu is unable to display anything to your screen until you install nvidia proprietary drivers on your system.  So what you've really got here is a two step problem, first you need to install Ubuntu, then you must install the nvidia proprietary drivers.  I don't know anything about BIOS support mode but I can confirm that I have a successful dual boot of windows 10 and ubuntu 15.04 using UEFI on both.  Here's what I would try for your system.\nFirst turn off your computer and unplug the DVI cord from your graphics card and plug it directly into your motherboard.  You may have to go into your BIOS and change the output of your motherboard to the internal graphics chip often times abbreviated IGX or IGFX, it should be under display options.\nNow turn on your computer and try to install Ubuntu from the live as normal.  Once that finishes you should be able to restart your computer and see the grub menu to select your OS.  If you don't see this grub read then you can try one of two things which I will detail in step 1 and 2.  If you do see grub and can load both OSes, skip to step 3.\n\n\n*\n\n*Try fixing grub using a boot repair live cd.  It's been a while since I've used this but if my memory is correct you just click an icon that's on the desktop and it runs the boot repair program for you.  If after this you can successfully launch both OSes then go to step 3.\n\n*If step 1 failed for you it is probably a complication from the BIOS support mode but I honestly can't say for sure because I've never used the feature.  If you can go without BIOS support mode I would suggest reinstalling windows in UEFI and then installing Ubuntu in UEFI, otherwise I have no idea how to help you.\n\n*Now you need to install your graphics card.  With the cord still plugged directly into your mother board launch Ubuntu and read this post from my blog about how to install dota 2 and there is a section for installing the graphics card.  It can be found at jordancamp.net.\n\n*Go back into BIOS and change your display settings back to your graphics card.  Turn off your computer and plug the DVI cord back into your graphics card and you should be good to go.\n\n*If you can see the grub screen but Ubuntu launches to a black screen you may have to disable the splash screen.  If that's the case leave a comment and I can tell you how to do that\n", "Q: Steam is an \"essential system package\"? Today I installed Ubuntu MATE. I went to the software boutique section from the welcome screen to start installing software, I install Steam however it doesn't work no matter how many times I click it. I thought I could just uninstall it, but whenever I try to, a dialog box pops up stating that Steam is an essential system package. How do I fix this problem? I am running Ubuntu MATE 16.04.\n\nA: Did you install it through the software centre or through the installer from Steam's website?

It features less out-of-the-box (i.e. you may need to install some codecs yourself) but functionally is the same as Google Chrome.\nTo do this, open up the Terminal and simply type,\nsudo apt-get install chromium-browser\n\nInput your password at prompt and let it install. When it's done, you should be able to open it from the Unity menu (Start menu, if you will) and log in if you have a Google account. That's it.\nAs I'm sure you're aware, Google stopped supporting Chrome for 32-bit (x32; i386) systems to keep current, but Chromium still supports these older systems.\n", "Q: Installation fails on Grub (Read only EFI partition?)

I get about 3MB/sec through my wireless LAN, tops. Usually hovers around 1MB/sec. \n2) Use my Mac. \nEven in these cases, I'm not able to actually play the .mp4 files in the native player without jumping through hoops, but that's an iPhone question, not a Linux question. \nMy question is:\nIs there any way to transfer the files using any package or library or script accessible through Ubuntu that goes over USB? It's almost six times faster. \nAdditonal requirements for an effective solution: \n\n\n*\n\n*Cannot use a VM, I already have a Mac that can do this. (In fact, it's actually faster for me to move the file to the Mac with a USB stick and then use iTunes than to try to transfer it over wifi.)\n\n*same thing for Wine, and I couldn't get it to work anyway. \n\n*Im fairly comfortable with the command line, and I'm even comfortable writing code if I have to, assuming there's a library that I can code against, with a decently clear API. \n\n*a third party app (any free video player on the App Store) can reach and play the file once it's on the phone. \n\n\nIf it's impossible, I'll just get an Android. This is my last ditch effort to find an answer. \nThanks!\nNote: I'm also unwilling to jailbreak the device, and it's on whatever the latest version available of iOS is.\nDue to an oversight I completely forgot to mention the problem. \nI'm perfectly able to use libimobiledevice to transfer the file. It just doesn't actually do anything. It takes up space on the device, but no application running on the device can access or even see the file. To reiterate, the intent of the question is to be able to actually use the file on the device from apps running on the device. If it's not possible, I understand. \n\nA: You need this : libimobiledevice\nThis is a cross-platform package which communicates with i-devices and get file-system access (and much more) and needs no jailbreaking.\nMost recent version is 1.2.0 and you can read details here: Official page : libimobiledevice.org\nComing to installation, there is already excellent description available here : Mounting i-devices on ubuntu \nAfter mounting your iphone like a USB device, you will be able to access the folders and then your transfer job will be just copy/paste thing.\n\nIf you are transferring a video file and it is not recognized by the default video app on iPhone, then the issue is with the file format including bitrate and frames per second. To solve this, one can simply convert to iPhone supported video format easily using Handbrake video encoder.\nThis application is available in the software repository and installation is easy using the the Software center on 14.04 or Software on 16.04.\nIn the application, choose 'iPhone and iPod touch' shown in  Devices menu on the right.\n(*  Most of the times it is noticed that the file size becomes smaller than original. If you have several files, you can queue them and convert all of them together.)\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*After the transfer of the files, you need to the Sync the folder where you have placed  the file(s) in the particular application, say iTunes to get the new video(s) playable.\n\n", "Q: How to Rename Multiple Files With Their First 10 Characters? I am having a problem to rename multiple files by replacing the name by their first 10 characters of their old name. I tried to find the solution in internet but I didn't find the answers.\nExample:\nOriginal File Names:\n1208605001abAcd.jpg \n1201230111FbcAdee.jpg \n11512345714x611aaa.jpg \n\nWhat I want to achieve: \n1208605001.jpg \n1201230111.jpg \n1151234571.jpg\n\n\nA: You can do with only bash:\nfor FILE in *.jpg ; do mv \"${FILE}\" \"${FILE:0:10}.jpg\" ; done\n\nWith a little work you can get file extension and add automagically to the new name.\n\nA: If you use zsh:\nzmv '(*).(*)' '${1:0:10}.$2'\n\nIf it's not already done, you may need to first run:\nautoload zmv\n\n\nA: You can try:\nrename -n 's/(.{10}).*(\\.jpg)$/$1$2/' *.jpg\n\nExample:\n$ rename -n 's/(.{10}).*(\\.jpg)$/$1$2/' *.jpg\n11512345714x611aaa.jpg -> 1151234571.jpg\n1201230111FbcAdee.jpg -> 1201230111.jpg\n1208605001abAcd.jpg -> 1208605001.jpg\n\nThe -n option only simulates the command, so that you can verify the changes. Run without it to actually make the changes.\nThe regex (.{10}).*(\\.jpg) consists:\n\n\n*\n\n*.{10} - any 10 characters, in a group (…), followed by\n\n*.* - any number of any characters followed by\n\n*\\.jpg$ - the extension at the end ($) of the filename, in the second group\n\n\nThe replacement $1$2 is just the first group followed by the second.\n\nA: If you want a GUI version, take a look at pyRenamer, a powerful bulk-renaming tool.\n\npyRenamer has two great advantages. One is that it allows you do a \"what if\", in other words to see what would happen before you commit to the change.\nThe other advantage is explained nicely in its description:\n\nYou can rename files using patterns, search and replace,\n  substitutions, insert or delete text, or even rename files manually.\nYou can also rename images using their EXIF tags and music using their\n  internal tags.\n\nTo install, use Ubuntu Software Centre or your favourite software installer, or use the command line issue the following command:\nsudo apt install pyrenamer\n\n", "Q: Copy file with scp command Trying to copy a file from RPi to my PC:\n$ scp MyFile.pdf user@192.168.0.83:~ \n\nssh: connect to host 192.168.0.83 port 22: connection refused\n\nlost connection\n\nWhen copying the same file from my PC it works fine:\n$ scp pi@192.168.0.82:/home/pi/Downloads/MagPi46.pdf /home/user/Desktop/\npi@192.168.0.82's password: \nMagPi46.pdf                              100%   21MB   1.0MB/s   00:21\n\nIs there a reason to why the file can be copied from PC to PC and not from RPi to PC ?    \n\nA: Your Pi is running an ssh server. Your PC is not. Both have ssh clients available. There are numerous ssh server packages available, but I don't know what kind of machine you are running on to recommend one. A simple Google \"install ssh server 'machine type, i.e., Linux'\" should suffice. \nTo test that it works on the machine you install it on, you can usually ssh user@localhost and not see that error message. \nIf you do have one installed, make sure that the port (22) is actually open on your firewall. \n", "Q: Python script in CRON is not running in AWS ubuntu 14.04 instance I want to schedule a CRON job into AWS Ubuntu instance.

I've seen this happen before when people forget to change the access on the key file. The recommended method is to attempt to use the key before turning off password based authentication. \nIf it's an instance in a cloud, call your provider and have them reset the password (which may not be free or even offered.)\nIf it's an actual box and you have someone that's nearby, call them and bribe them with pizza. \nOtherwise, need to get in your car. \nWhen you get to the computer, hit whatever magic F-key gets you into a boot menu on boot, and then select \"root shell\".

recent codecs to deal with it. Your avconv version  is quite outdated, I suggest you give it a go with the latest ffmpeg, which is now included in universe since 15.04.\nOn any Ubuntu newer than that, a simple apt update followed by apt install ffmpeg will install a newer version.

I can get the wireless to connect to our wifi network, but if I unplug the LAN cable, the wireless network does not work.\nIf I have the LAN cable unplugged and reboot, the system starts to boot and then hangs for five minutes before completing the boot.

It is accessed  by some software and kept in RAM memory for various reasons. It's just like in Windows when some file is being blocked from deletion while accessed/opened by some software. You need to 'unmount' that partition in order to edit it in GParted.  \nThis cannot be done from within a running system, you will have to (create and) use a GParted or Ubuntu LiveCD/LiveDVD/LiveUSB. Insert the live medium into PC and boot to the desktop. At this point, all partitions on the internal disk should be unmounted, thus unlocked. Open GParted and edit them as you desire.  \nNote : When doing it from an Ubuntu Live media, right-click the swap partition - select swapoff.\n", "Q: What is the best way to deal with default Windows partitions when dual booting 16.04 on fresh Windows 10 install? I installed windows 10 on a fresh computer with a single drive.  It created 4 partitions (system, c:, hibernation, and recovery).  \nAfter freeing up some space on C: and trying to install ubuntu 16.04, the partition space I freed up was \"unusable\" by ubuntu; looking at other questions on this topic, it seems one cannot have more than 4 partitions on a drive.\nMy question is, what's the easiest solution? Delete a hibernation partition? \n\nA: You can have a maximum of 4 primary partitions, but you can have more extended partitions.  See the following web page for more info\nhttp://www.disk-partition.com/resource/disk-partition-basic-understanding.html\n", "Q: Locked computer gets very hot despite no CPU-intensive tasks running I'm using Ubuntu 15.10 on my HP ProBook 6470b laptop. When I lock it and walk away from my desk it often gets very hot, very quickly.\nHere's a screenshot of Psensor graph which shows the problem, the temperature started to raise just after I locked the device.\n\nAnswer: Yeah, it was compiz. No, I don't yet know how to fix it\nI was trying to find the root cause of this, but I'm running out of the ideas. More details about my setup:\n\n\n*\n\n*This is my work computer, it runs in Windows-based corporate environment.\n\n*The computer is usually docked into station, but the problem also appears when its undocked.\n\n*The computer starts to cool down when I unlock it, without any additional actions.\n\n*No external devices (except Logitech mouse) are connected.\n\n*I'm using Compiz with Unity, pretty much default setup (I enabled some compiz plugins though, I love them).\n\n\nSo far I tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Installed a few power-monitoring and controlling tools, like cpufrequtils and tlp. I'm using powersave CPU governor.\n\n*Compiled libstdc++ with patch for GCC Bug 68921 since it was suggested that if fixes the issue I'm having\n\n*Turned off VBlank sync and enabled forced full screen redraw for compiz, as suggested in another report of (probably) the same bug\nNone of that helped. \nNext, I started a tiny command logging CPU usage every 3 seconds, to identify the processes responsible for the problem:  while true; do date >> logfile.txt; ps -eo pcpu,pid,comm | sort -k 1 -r | head -10 >> logfile.txt; echo -e '\\n-----------------------\\n' >> logfile.txt; sleep 3; done\n\n\nDo not use ps for this. Use top: top -b >> logfile.txt\nWhen I came back to my desk and heard the laptop's fans running at full speed, I checked the logfile immiediately - it turned out, that... nothing actually eats the whole CPU. The most CPU-intensive application was indeed compiz, but it used 3.2% of the CPU at most. during the whole time, there was no indication of any process going mad. Here's a sample log frame:\n 3.1  2732 compiz\n 2.1  3510 chrome\n 1.8  1141 Xorg\n 1.4  3566 chrome\n 1.4 24014 evolution\n 0.9  3733 chrome\n 0.9 21418 firefox\n 0.8  3489 psensor\n 0.4  4164 abiword\n 0.3 20256 chrome\n\nDo you have any idea what I could do next to fix the issue, or at least find the cause? \n\nA: I noticed some heat issues with Ubuntu as well, that is to say I really noticed the heat after picking up a very hot idle laptop. \nUltimately for me the solution was as simple as a can of well applied air duster to make sure the cooling system could function more efficiently.\n\nA: compiz is a windowing manager.  This may be common knowledge.  But some comments hint it is not.  Some (many?) HP laptops are designed such that the CPU and Graphics Processor share the same heat management resources. If we assume the CPU is cool and the Graphics Processor is over loaded, this explains how Psensor can report high temperatures and low CPU usage.  And, assuming speed mitigation utilities only work on the CPU, this also explains why such utilities are ineffective in managing this over heating problem.\nI have observed episodes where \"top\" ranks compiz at 120% CPU usage and Psensor reporting centigrade temperatures in the 80s.\nAlso of concern.  HP has a history of badly managing Graphic Processor head mitigation.\nThis article contains many good ideas worth exploring.  However, the best solution may be to consider a different graphics driver or a simpler desktop.  Look for \"D. Try a lighter desktop environment\" in the above link / article.\n", "Q: Cannot find unity-tweak-tool in Software Centre I installed the 32 bit version of Ubuntu 16.04 in my Lenovo g565 laptop but there are software missing in Software Center. \nThese include the vital ones that is the unity-tweak-tool, rawtherapee, many games etc.\nI re-installed the 64bit version but the problem is same. Is this something normal or do I have a problem of hardware or a bug in the system?\n\nA: I am also running Ubuntu 16.04 x64 and confirm that both applications you mention appear in Software Centre on my system.\nThe problem could possibly be your software sources. Check the \"Software & Updates\" screen within \"System Settings\". The picture below shows how mine currently looks. I believe \"Universe\" would be required for Unity Tweak Tool.\n\nIt would also be worth checking the server in the \"Download from\" drop down.

I try to install the Ubuntu version 14.04 14.10 15.04 15.10 16.04 ,but all failed.\nOnly one time, I success install 14.04, but it is too lagging and not smooth to use. So I reinstalled it , and it failed.\nAnd I can't log in to the Windows 10 system at last, so I sent the computer to the sale support..\nDose MSI laptop support Ubuntu system ? \n\nA: You're actual question really relates to supported hardware. This link is to the supported hardware section of the Ubuntu installation guide (for x64) and this should help you confirm the answer.\n\nA: I don't have a MSI GE72-6QF-073, but i had an older MSI 12.6' ultrabook which ran LinuxMint and Lubuntu very well. I see no reason why a gaming laptop like yours could not run Ubuntu smoothly.\nWhy send laptop to sale support? You should run a Windows installation DVD/USB disk and choose Repair Windows option. Ubuntu is liter than Windows, therefore it should run better and faster than Windows.\n", "Q: Nautilus Cannot Move Files to Trash When Trash is in eCryptfs / Files are on a Different Drive I used to just press the Delete key on selected files on Nautilus, and then it would trash the file(s) without confirmation. That was very convenient.\nI later decided that my Trash may contain sensitive files, and thus moved it to the eCryptfs Private folder, and created the symlink ~/.local/share in its place.\nThereafter, when I Delete files that are inside eCryptfs, behavior is as expected, no problems. On the other hand, when I try to delete files in my home directory but outside eCryptfs, I get this message:\n\nThe same behavior is seen when deleting items from a different drive...\nIs there a workaround to just automatically put it in my encrypted trash anyways even if it belongs to another/unencrypted drive/mount?\nIf that really cannot be done, then is two Trashes possible? One for encrypted files and another for unencrypted ones?\n\nA: When you move files to trash with Nautilus or gvfs-trash they are never moved to a different volume. They are “renamed” to a different directory entry (inside the trash directory) on the same volume. Note that the documentation of that function explains that files cannot be “renamed” onto different volumes or mount points.\nThis means that moving a file to the trash from an encrypted volume (whether by eCryptFS, dm-crypt/LUKS or anything else that requires the kernel to mount something) will never result in the decryption of the file. Hence I don't think it's beneficial to link ~/.local/share/Trash to something underneath ~/Private. You can test that with the following commands:\ncd ~/Private\ntouch foobar.txt\ngvfs-trash foobar.txt\nls -1 ~/.local/share/Trash/files/foobar.txt* ~/Private/.Trash-*/files/foobar.txt*\n\nwhich should give you something like:\nls: cannot access /home/david/.local/share/Trash/files/foobar.txt*: No such file or directory\n/home/david/Private/.Trash-1000/files/foobar.txt\n\n\nInterestingly the file doesn't turn up in my virtual trash folder:\n$ gvfs-ls trash:// | grep -cwFe foobar.txt\n0\n\n(While the same works when I do gvfs-trash ~/foobar.txt.)\n\nFor the reason outlined above I think it's impossible with the current implementation of gvfs-trash to have a trash on a different volume than the original volume of the file sent to trash.\n", "Q: apt-get wants to auto delete important packages when i'm using apt-get upgrade, it shows me this, but I need those packages, how can I require those packages?\nroot@K411:~# apt-get upgrade\nReading package lists...

just don't run sudo apt-get autoremove and bare with the message (if you don't run that command the upgrade won't remove those packages). Also, it is inadvisable to run sudo apt-get upgrade as that does not upgrade the important stuff which needs upgrading (as you can see from the message), so I highly advise that you run sudo apt-get dist-upgrade instead.\n   dist-upgrade\n       dist-upgrade in addition to performing the function of upgrade,\n       also intelligently handles changing dependencies with new versions\n       of packages; apt-get has a \"smart\" conflict resolution system, and\n       it will attempt to upgrade the most important packages at the\n       expense of less important ones if necessary. The dist-upgrade\n       command may therefore remove some packages. The\n       /etc/apt/sources.list file contains a list of locations from which\n       to retrieve desired package files.

In Windows, I used to use a wifi dongle, however the  dongle is now also blocked by the hardware switch in Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. I also had this problem in 16.04 but tried to solve by going back to 14.04. I have tried the solution suggested by blacklisting the kernel driver for the internal wifi card but the problem persists.\nrfkill lists the dongle as not hard or soft blocked but the network manager still lists it as deactivated by hardware switch.\nIs there anything else I could try?\n\nA: I fixed this by uninstalling network manager and using wicd-gtk instead.\n", "Q: 15.10 - Cannot connect to wireless networks at home, but can at remote locations?

Any ideas?\n\nA: Windows offers automatic switching between Access Points and channels to find the best connection. Ubuntu comes with GNOME Network Manager that does not offer this fuctionality.\nThis will cause problems if you use your laptop in a congested enviroment with many access points and many channels. Look at this section of the results of your WiFi script.\nChannel occupancy:\n\n      4   APs on   Frequency:2.412 GHz (Channel 1)\n      5   APs on   Frequency:2.437 GHz (Channel 6)\n      1   APs on   Frequency:5.18 GHz (Channel 36)\n      7   APs on   Frequency:5.32 GHz (Channel 64)\n      6   APs on   Frequency:5.745 GHz (Channel 149)\n\nYou are using channel 1. Lets look at that in more detail, again from the results of your wireless script. The 4 access points are\nUCSD-PROTECTED\neduroam\nUCSD-GUEST\nUCSD-DEVICE\n\nand you are connected to the first of these. This is probably the access point and channel the majority of non-Windows users are connected to so it is massively overloaded.\nThe next Channel that has access points is channel 6. The access points are\nUCSD-PROTECTED\neduroam\nUCSD-GUEST\nUCSD-GUEST\nUCSD-DEVICE\n\nand so on ad nauseum. All of these access points are contending with each other and since the network administrator who created this chaos did not include the channel number in the channel name there is no easy way to manually ensure you connect to the best access point and channel.\nTo solve this you need to get your computer to do the hard work through a script such as getwifi .\n", "Q: System monitor in corner of Desktop whenever I boot into Ubuntu 16.04 Every time I boot into Ubuntu, I get this small system monitor like window and if I click outside of the box it will be removed, but I still want to know what is causing this.\n\n\nA: It looks like it is a conky window. Conky is a system monitor for X Windows that displays statistics about your system and can be configured in the .conkyrc file that is in your home directory. If your intention is removing it you should be able to by running:\nsudo apt-get purge conky*\n\n", "Q: How do I configure Keystone with Juju? As a follow up on this question: How do I configure Keystone with Juju? \nOther questions on this topic like this ask what they need to be able to use Juju in their openstack installation. I need it just the other way around. I want to configure keystone for authentication against Active Directory, but the first thing in the keystone config file is:\n# [ WARNING ]\n# Configuration file maintained by Juju. Local changes may be overwritten.\n\nThis warning should be heeded, as the config changes are reset after a reboot of the container.\nI searched the whole filesystem of the container for files related to keystone and juju, but the only file I could find (/var/lib/juju/agents/unit-keystone-0/charm/.juju-persistent-config) that seems related is also reset after the reboot.\nSo, where can I configure juju to create a keystone config file with my additions for Active Directory?\n\nA: I'll try to provide a starting answer, and hopefully someone can edit and improve my answer if they have more relevant information.\nConfiguration options can be found at JUJU Keystone Charm.\nFrom your machine with juju tools installed.\nexport JUJU_HOME=~/.cloud-install/juju\njuju ssh landscape-server/0 sudo 'JUJU_HOME=/var/lib/landscape/juju-homes/`sudo ls -rt /var/lib/landscape/juju-homes/ | tail -1` sudo -u landscape -E bash'\n\nOnce connected you can juju set keystone \"key=value\" using the values found in the juju keystone charm page.

I have a Ubuntu 14.04 machine connected to the same subnet via two different interfaces, wlan0 and eth0. The machine is used for normal  browsing of internet only. I am to manually assign IP addresses to both the network connections.\nIs it okey to assign the same IP to both the network connections even though both the interfaces are physically connected? I can save my precious IPv4 addressed and avoid assigning two IPs to a single machine.\nOr should we give different IPs to both the interfaces to avoid IP conflicts? \nIf the answer is a \"No\". Please also tell me why it is so. What I can't seem to understand is that the layer in which google chrome (for example)\nruns won't mind how it got the data (ip layer), as long as it got the data.\n\nA: \nIs it okay to assign the same IP to both the network connections...\n\nNo. this would not be okay, by any means.  This would most likely cause problems.\n\n...assuming that only one of the connections will be used at a time\n\nWell, if it's truly only using one at a time (meaning that only one of the interfaces is up at a time), then you shouldn't see any issue.  This would be similar to a machine falling off the WiFi, and then your router re-assigning that same IP to a new machine;  it happens all the time.\n\n\n*\n\n*You can list your NICs with: ifconfig\n\n*You can turn off an interface: ifdown eth0\n\n*You can turn on an interface: ifup eth0\nSo, I guess the answer lies in how precious your IPv4 addresses on your LAN really are, to do something not recommended, as well as how you use your computer day-to-day.\n\nHaving two NICs on the same IP is technically possibly, but is not trivial to set up.  You could use bonding or LACP to do one of two things:\n\n\n*\n\n*Increase the available bandwidth (bonding)\n\n*Have a default interface that can fall back to another interface if  the primary goes down (failover)\n\n\n\nAssuming you use a typical setup (different IPs/dhcp)\nDifferent applications may act differently depending upon your IP switching.  It is very-client specific, but browsers, such as chromium-browser, should see very little issue if you change your IP (as long as you don't load a page while you switch IPs/NICs).  Browsers typically make and close connections quickly, which makes them resilient to these changes.  \nSome clients, such as ssd may see hickups or disconnects, but behind a NAT router you'll probably not see many issues.  Changing your IP/NIC on an application that streams or keeps a constant connection is more likely to cause an issue.\n\nAssuming you use a single NIC at a time, with the same IP\nBe aware that some hardware will learn paths to different machines (routes) and need time or to be reset if a route to an IP changes (ie: You use the same IP on two different NICs).  This could cause additional issues you wouldn't see if you just had a normal, dhcp setup on the two NICs.\n\nHow do you use your computer?\nDo you stay under one LAN, or do you travel with your machine?  If you stay under one LAN, you might be able to get the same IP working on both NICs, but these settings may cause issues when you travel.\n\nIPv4 Shortage\nRouters nowadays seem to be using 192.168.1.0/24 (255.255.255.000) subnet.  That gives you 256 addresses.  This is typically enough for a home environment.\nIf you have 256+ machines, then you have the option of creating and the fun of routing between multiple subnets.  You could go with 192.168.2.0/24 and that'd give you 256 additional addresses.  Or you could go with 192.168.0.0/16 (255.255.000.000) which would give you a whopping 65,536 addresses.\nIt is true that the world is running low on IPv4 addresses, but there are a few private networks reserved that should suite your needs.\n", "Q: Auto restart rc.local script on crash I have rc.local loading a script on start up. Wondering if this service crashes is there a way to have it auto restart? \n\nA: Instead of using /etc/rc.local for long-running services, create a systemd service. As an example, create /etc/systemd/system/foo.service, containing:\n[Unit]\nDescription=Foo\n\n[Service]\nType=simple\nExecStart=/usr/bin/sleep 10\nRestart=always\n\n[Install]\nWantedBy=default.target\n\nThis creates a service that will restart the command when it dies. Replace ExecStart with your command.\nAfter creating this file, do:\nsudo systemctl daemon-reload\nsudo systemctl enable foo.service\nsudo systemctl start foo.service\n\nThe first command will tell systemctl to look for new service definitions. The second enables the service according to the startup conditions it has (in this case, to start with the default.target, so that it starts at boot). The last command starts the service for this session.\n\nFor Type:\n\nIf set to simple (the default if neither Type= nor BusName=, but\n  ExecStart= are specified), it is expected that the process configured\n  with ExecStart= is the main process of the service. In this mode, if\n  the process offers functionality to other processes on the system, its\n  communication channels should be installed before the daemon is\n  started up (e.g. sockets set up by systemd, via socket activation), as\n  systemd will immediately proceed starting follow-up units.\nIf set to forking, it is expected that the process configured with\n  ExecStart= will call fork() as part of its start-up. The parent\n  process is expected to exit when start-up is complete and all\n  communication channels are set up. The child continues to run as the\n  main daemon process. This is the behavior of traditional UNIX daemons.\n  If this setting is used, it is recommended to also use the PIDFile=\n  option, so that systemd can identify the main process of the daemon.\n  systemd will proceed with starting follow-up units as soon as the\n  parent process exits.\n\nSo, if your command forks, then use Type=forking and set PIDFile if you can.\n\nFor WantedBy, run systemctl list-units | grep target to find other available targets that you can use for more fine-grained control.\n", "Q: \"Host key verification failed\"? Well, I'm working with virtual machines and I was trying to establish connection between client and server by ssh (from client to server). I installed ssh in both machine and I restarted too. It was not a problem. But, when I tried to connect from client with:\nssh -p 22 myservername@myserverip\n\nIt said: \"Host key verification failed\". It's always the same, whatever I've done.\nThis is the second time I've tried it (I uninstalled the two ubuntus and installed again)\nWhat could I do to establish that connection?\n\nA: When you reinstall a machine it gets a new ssh host key, but the old one is still stored in your key file.\nOpen ~/.ssh/known_hosts with an editor and remove the lines containing the problematic host keys.\nAlternatively you can use ssh-keygen to remove the problematic entries automatically.\nssh-keygen -R myserverip\nssh-keygen -R myservername\n\nYou'll be asked to verify the new host keys the next time you connect.\n\nA: here is the answer of this problem\nused -oStrictHostKeyChecking=no in the command\nscp -oStrictHostKeyChecking=no -r -i openssh.pem test.txt root@x.x.x.x:/home/\n\nfixed the issue after adding -oStrictHostKeyChecking=no\n", "Q: I am not allowed to log into my gmail account.

Try a different browser or a different device (like a phone). Cookies only helps the browser to remember the password next time you log in. The correct password should work every time. Check the CapsLock key and the keyboard layout.

I had installed ubuntu 16.04 LTS (Desktop (64-bit)) and I had one partition only and lost all the data I had before...then I switched to windows vista and I resized the partitions by deleting them and clicking on NEW in the installation window of windows vista and I made three new partitions and I realized that more than 12 GBs of the free disk space of the hard drive were lost and I didn't know if they were lost while installing ubuntu before or not...then after installing windows vista I didn't find one of the partitions and I couldn't open the other one and the last one (C:) was the only one I was able to open.\nWhat can I do to find the lost free disk space and run windows normally again?\n\nA: First of all. Nobody stole your hard disk space. It is there. Somewhere. Whole of it. I swear.\nSecondly, Ubuntu and Windows are two entirely and fundamentally different operating systems. They function completely... different. Windows has ntfs and fat partitions, Ubuntu typically has swap and ext partitions. Ubuntu can recognize Windows partitions, but Windows CANNOT recognize or identify Ubuntu partitions.  \nWhen reinstalling Windows, you tried to erase the entire hard disk, but Windows could not do that because it couldn't recognize some or all of the linux partitions. 12 GB seems like correct size for the swap partition (not recognized).  \nAnd now, the solution: you need to boot the Ubuntu installation medium in live mode. After the Live Ubuntu desktop starts, open GParted and you will see ALL the partitions on your hard drive. Including those not \"seen\" by Windows. Delete the ext and swap partitions. Make sure you don't delete your ntfs (Windows) partition. After applying the changes reboot, remove the Ubuntu installation medium and boot into Windows.  \nIn Windows, go to Start and open Disk Management app. Your lost space should magically appear as empty/unformatted space on your hard disk map.  \nBit of advice: it is easier if you first install Windows and Ubuntu afterwards. Much easier for beginners. For many reasons.\n", "Q: Strange screen at bootup Xubuntu 16 A saw a complain about Ubuntu 14, but the picture is no longer available, so I don't know if is the same problem of mine.\nPhoto: Xubuntu booting with style:\n\nI just installed Xubuntu 16 and I'm very happy with the result so far, but when it boots, the first screen is an abstract art picture.

The newer live-usb ISO's are hybrids that work for both MBR and GPT systems. gparted cannot read these after Startup Disk Creator has burned the ISO to the USB flash drive. Rather than taking your USB to another computer to reformat it you can use dd (Data Destroyer, real name Data Duplicator):\nsudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdX bs=512 count=1\n\nChange sdX to sdd, sde, or whatever your USB drive letter is.\nUse dd with great caution!\n\nAs you discovered Ubuntu 16.04 Startup Disk Creator no longer provides an option for persistence storage for a Live Boot USB Flash Drive.

To keep my story short: I'm trying to play a game in WINE fullscreen, but actual fullscreen mode for this particular game crashes too much, so I'm running it windowed at my native resolution. However the Unity bar and launcher are both visible when I do this, so I want to install a secondary DE just for WINE games (I'm thinking Xfce because it uses GTK+2, which hopefully won't interfere with anything to do with Unity's GTK+3).\nI know it's as simple as sudo apt install xubuntu-desktop (or whatever the equivalent is for the DE I will choose), but I once tried this with KDE in 14.04 and it caused considerable problems with the visuals and functionality of Unity (Qt would override GTK+ visuals, Nautilus would crash at launch, etc.). Do you have any tips for installing a second DE that I can switch to at login without interfering with the stability of Unity? Am I correct in assuming that Xfce will likely cause the least amount of difficulty?\n\nA: Since Ubuntu doesn't really have very good support for multiple DEs, things like themes, icons, and colors will be the same in every DE you install. Some programs will too.\nUnfortunately, I don't think there's a way to isolate DEs from each other, so there's always the issue of conflicts and other annoyances from installing another DE along with your current one.\nIt's really just a risk you have to take when you install multiple DEs. If one causes problems, or you don't like it, it can always be uninstalled with\nsudo apt-get purge DENAME-*\nbut that could uninstall important packages for every DE installed.\n\nA: Xfce most likely won't cause any problems since it is also based on GTK+ (GTK+ 2, yes, but that is already installed).\nKDE causing problems would probably be due to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Toolkit differences: KDE is Qt while Unity, GNOME and Xfce share the GTK+ toolkit\n\n*You installed the kubuntu-desktop package which brings in the whole KDE universe\nNow, if you just want to pop into Xfce once in a while for a game, install xfce4 rather than xubuntu-desktop - it just installs the core Xfce desktop, not all of Xfce's apps.\nAdditional:\nSome tweaks to give you a near fullscreen experience.\n\n\n*\n\n*Set Xfce-panel to autohide (Right-click on panel->Panel->Panel preferences->Automatically hide the panel->set to 'Always')\n\n*Tell Xfce to hide the titlebar when maximized (Settings Manager->Window Manager Tweaks->Accessibility->Check 'Hide title of windows when maximized')\n", "Q: Unable to run docker-machine despite trying to add path I downloaded the docker toolkit from docker.

I have been a Linux user for three weeks now, and I really don't know what to do anymore :-( I tried to install Telegram on my Linux Ubuntu 16.04 LTS through various ways but with no success. Now I have a defunct \"Telegram Desktop\" icon in Dash, but I am not able to remove it. This is what I did:\n\n\n*\n\n*I tried to install \"telegram-sergiusens\" through Ubuntu Software. This didn't work though, actually I couldn't even find the whole Telegram on my system. Result: I removed the application through Ubuntu Software.\n\n\nNext, I tried to install Telegram via terminal. I followed the instructions at Pupuweb. This is what I did:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:noobslab/apps\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install telegram-desktop\n\nThis didn't go without complications either. I received the following error message:\n\nE: Unable to locate package telegram-desktop\n\nWell, I suppose that only the personal package archive (PPA) got installed, not the application. Therefore, I followed another set of instructions to remove the installation (I ran the commands to purge the application though, just to make sure):\nsudo apt-get purge telegram-desktop\nsudo add-apt-repository --remove ppa:noobslab/apps\n\nNow, I tried to follow YET ANOTHER set of instructions. This time I downloaded I file called \"tsetup.0.6.15.tar.xz\" from https://desktop.telegram.org. The instructions went as follows:\n\n\n*Extract the file (right-click the icon and choose \"extract here\"; you will now have a folder called \"Telegram\"\n\n*Move the file to /opt. In order to do this, you have to open the file manager with root privileges. To do that:\n\n*sudo nautilus\nAfter executing command number 9 in the terminal, however, I receive the following error message:\n\n(nautilus:1061): Gtk-WARNING **: Failed to register client: GDBus.Error:org.freedesktop.DBus.Error.ServiceUnknown: The name org.gnome.SessionManager was not provided by any .service files\n** (nautilus:1061): CRITICAL **: Another desktop manager in use; desktop window won't be created Nautilus-Share-Message: Called \"net usershare info\" but it failed: 'net usershare' returned error 255: net usershare: cannot open usershare directory /var/lib/samba/usershares. Error No such file or directory Please ask your system administrator to enable user sharing.\n\nWeird enough, some sort of file manager window did pop up, but I am not sure if this happened with the root privileges mentioned above. Well, I tried to move the \"Telegram\" folder to /opt, but nothing happened. Out of curiosity, I opened the folder that was extracted to the \"Downloads\" folder, and I was able to open to application. However, the icon on the launcher was a gray question mark, so I wasn't yet quite satisfied. I deleted both the \"Telegram\" folder and \"tsetup.0.6.15.tar.xz\". They can be found from my trash bin at the moment.\nLast but not least, I gave a try for the final set of instructions (I cannot post the link as a new user, but it's a thread called \"How to install Telegram Desktop in Ubuntu 14.04 LTS [duplicate]\" on the very forum). This is what I did:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:atareao/telegram\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install telegram\n\nAfter this, I still wasn't able to find Telegram through Dash. Therefore, I tried to remove the installation I made by:\nsudo apt-get purge telegram sudo add-apt-repository --remove ppa:atareao/telegram\n\nNow I am baffled. I've been a Linux user for three weeks now, and I really would appreciate your help! :-) I'd like try again from the scratch, but I am not able to remove the ghost icon from the Dash.\n\nA: It looks like you have basically undone all the steps, so you should be back to a clean slate.

However if you're on some sort of production server that \"needs to always work\" than you might run into issues that require a certain version of GCC.

It has been the default package manager for many years, and you can install it from \"Software\"/\"Software manager\", just search for Synaptic, or try sudo apt-get install synaptic.\nIt has a powerful search function that will find packages by their names or by their functionallity (i.e. you search for text editor and it list a huge list of related packages).  It can also be used to know the package name of some already installed software, when you want to run them from command line, for example to run something with specific parameters or with root permissions.  (For example \"sudo gedit\", to save and edit text based config files)\n\nA: Depending on your package manager (works for both apt, aptitude), you can do this from the terminal\napt search package-name\n\nOr you could further format and filter down results like this:\napt search firefox | grep -A 3 firefox\n\nSee Also: How do I search for available packages from the command-line?\n", "Q: How do I activate my usb modem in my VM ubuntu server with windows host? I have ubuntu-16.04-server-amd64 running in my virtual-box and I want to use gammu to send sms with my HUAWEI E153 HSDPA usb stick.

The serial/comport side of it is just for operational usage after the device is initialised and it wont be visible until that has happened.\nYou should pass through the whole device as a usb device and not as a serial device or comport. Serial pass through is only really for old school hardware serial ports not usb emulated serial ports. \nAnother approach would be to configure the modem on the host and then use virtualbox internal networking to pass through the network connection by adding a network adapter in bridged or NAT mode and selecting the correct uplink.  As your host is windows you should be able to use a supported driver on that platform. I wasn't sure if you wanted this modem to be private to the guest or was just struggling to share the connection.\n\nA: Why exactly did you try to activate a serial port for a USB device?  A USB device is not connected to a serial port.  Right below the serial ports are the USB ports.  You should go there, find the port where the modem is connected to, and tell virtualbox to use it.\nAs soon as the device gets rerouted to the vm, it will get disconnected from your host system and it will stay that way until you close the vm.\n", "Q: After switching mouse buttons is with xinput, each computer restart resets the settings How does one go about \"saving\" settings in Ubuntu?

The command is this: sudo apt-get remove package-name or sudo apt remove package-name. If you would also like to remove all traces of any configuration files for the font, you can use purge instead of remove like this: sudo apt-get purge package-name or like this: sudo apt purge package-name\nHowever, if you have manually installed a font like I did, you should find it in: /home/yourusername/.local/share/fonts/ and you can simply just delete the font file there.

Anyway, when I upgraded to 16.04 tried to install it again using same steps, no success or whatsoever. \nWhen I issue a command /etc/init.d/ccpd status I get not two not one but like 5 rows of numbers, maybe about 50-70.\nOtherwise, accessing the printer from the cups web based interface, I can see it and I can assign it a task to print a test page, although it shows job completed I don't see anything. \nCUPS_ConfigPath = /etc/cups/\nLOG Path        = None\nUI Port         = 59787\n\nEntry Num  : Spooler    : Backend   : FIFO path     : Device Path   :   Status \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n [0]    : LBP6020   : ccp       : //localhost:59687     : /dev/usb/lp0  : New! !\n\nDon't know what the issue is, maybe have to wait for new drivers? \n\nA: I've done some digging on this issue. I have found a way on how to get the Canon LBP6020 printer working.\nMy Ubuntu version is 16.04 64-Bit with the Canon CAPT Printer Driver Version 2.70.\nFirstly I had to setup Ubuntu so it could install 32-bit packages. Even though we're installing 64 Bit Canon drivers, some parts of the installation will need 32-bit packages installing. To get this setup I followed the instructions here: Installing 32-bit libraries on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS 64-bit, running the code:\nsudo dpkg --add-architecture i386\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install libc6:i386 libncurses5:i386 libstdc++6:i386 libpopt0:i386\n\nThen for installing the Canon packages, I followed these instructions from the French Ubuntu docs: https://doc.ubuntu-fr.org/imprimante_canon_capt2, please take note of the parts where the instructions mention installing the libglade2-0 package and these 32-bit packages: libatk1.0-0:i386,libcairo2:i386,libgtk2.0-0:i386,libpango1.0-0:i386,libstdc++6:i386,libxml2:i386,libpopt0:i386. You will also have to update the /etc/init.d/ccpd file with what is mentioned in the instructions.\nI won't re-post the instructions here as the page linked above includes all of the instructions I used for my setup to work properly, hopefully this will work for you too.\nAnother issue I ran into, was when running Google translate on the French instructions, Google translate changed some of the text within the commands. It's best if you can install any commands from the original non-translated version (I kept the translated and non-translated pages side-by-side).\nCheers, hope this helps.\n\nA: I tried all the other answers but none worked for me. This was the only way it worked in my case (Xubuntu 17.04):\nDownload a script canon_lbp_setup.sh from russian community;\ncd ~/Downloads\nchmod +x canon_lbp_setup.sh\nsudo dpkg --add-architecture i386\nsudo apt-get update\n./canon_lbp_setup.sh\n\nThere could be errors about dependencies; if so, run\nsudo apt-get install -f\n\nThe only dependency that was not found in our repos was libpng12-0, I found it here, downloaded the .deb package and installed it using:\nsudo dpkg -i libpng12-0_1.2.54-1ubuntu1_amd64.deb\n\nEvery time you execute sudo apt-get install -f to install some dependency you have to run the script ./canon_lbp_setup.sh again.\n", "Q: How to set up dialup on Ubuntu 16.04?

Here's a sample of what I see: \nsudo apt-get -qq -y --force-yes install cowsay 2>&1 > /tmp/tmp.txt\n\nThis is a sample command that I'm running on 16.04. I'm including the --force-yes here to simulate an apt warning for future use. now I expect this command to redirect everything to /tmp/tmp.txt ; and most of the code is doing this. However when I run it I get the following:\n$ sudo apt-get -qq -y --force-yes remove cowsay 2>&1 > /tmp/tmp.txt\nW: --force-yes is deprecated, use one of the options starting with --allow instead.\n\nHow do I get warnings to redirect to my file too?\n\nA: You have the stream redirection command in the wrong place. Redirections get parsed from right to left, therefore you need to first write the > /tmp/tmp.txt and then the 2>&1. As you wrote it, it first redirects STDOUT to the file and afterwards redirects STDERR to STDOUT.\nThis is the correct command:\nsudo apt-get -qq -y --force-yes remove cowsay > /tmp/tmp.txt 2>&1\n\nBut there's a simpler alternative! You don't necessarily need to redirect STDERR into STDOUT to get both written into a file, there's also an operator that directly redirects both STDOUT and STDERR to a file: &>\nsudo apt-get -qq -y --force-yes remove cowsay &> /tmp/tmp.txt\n\nExplanation and further info:\n\n\n*\n\n*> filename redirects STDOUT (stream 1) to filename\n\n*2> filename redirects STDERR (stream 2) to filename\n\n*&> filename redirects STDOUT and STDERR to filename\nSimilarly if you want to pipe the output to a second command:\n\n\n*\n\n*| redirects STDOUT (stream 1) to the second command's STDIN\n\n*2| filename redirects STDERR (stream 2) to the second command's STDIN\n\n*&| filename redirects STDOUT and STDERR to the second command's STDIN\n\n", "Q: Win XP on VirtualBox not recognizing USB I have UbuntuMATE 16.04 and recently installed Windows XP on VirtualBox, but everytime y connect a USB stick or my External Hard Drive it's not recognized by Windows.\nUbuntu recognizes both USB stick and the External Hard Drive.\nI'm running the latest version of VirtualBox.\n\nA: I had this same issue, and even though my account is sudo, I still needed to do this to get access to my USB on the client machine.\nsudo usermod -a -G vboxusers your_user_name\n\nThat will hopefully fix the issue.\n\nA: In addition to installing GuestAdditions, make sure you have Service Pack 3 for XP.

I keep getting the following error error \nxterm: xt error can't open display xterm display is not set\nI have searched online but haven't found any solution. Please can anyone help me out ?\n\nA: This is likely due to either a misconfiguration issue or you have multiple displays. As can be seen in the xterm manpage (man xterm) you can set the display using the -display flag:\n   -display display\n           This option specifies the X server to contact; see X(7).\n\nIf you then look in X(7) where it specifies to look (man X) you will see what you need to put after the flag:\nDISPLAY NAMES\n       From  the  user's perspective, every X server has a display name of the\n       form:\n\n              hostname:displaynumber.screennumber\n\n       This information is used by the application to determine how it  should\n       connect  to  the  server  and which screen it should use by default (on\n       displays with multiple monitors):\n\n       hostname\n               The hostname specifies the name of the  machine  to  which  the\n               display is physically connected.  If the hostname is not given,\n               the most efficient way of communicating to a server on the same\n               machine will be used.\n\n       displaynumber\n               The  phrase  \"display\" is usually used to refer to a collection\n               of monitors that share a common set of input devices (keyboard,\n               mouse,  tablet, etc.).  Most workstations tend to only have one\n               display.  Larger, multi-user systems, however, frequently  have\n               several  displays  so  that  more  than one person can be doing\n               graphics work at once.  To avoid confusion, each display  on  a\n               machine  is assigned a display number (beginning at 0) when the\n               X server for that display is started.  The display number  must\n               always be given in a display name.\n\n       screennumber\n               Some displays share their input devices among two or more moni‐\n               tors.  These may be configured  as  a  single  logical  screen,\n               which  allows  windows to move across screens, or as individual\n               screens, each with their own set  of  windows.   If  configured\n               such  that each monitor has its own set of windows, each screen\n               is assigned a screen number (beginning at 0) when the X  server\n               for  that  display  is  started.   If  the screen number is not\n               given, screen 0 will be used.\n\n       On POSIX systems, the default display name is stored  in  your  DISPLAY\n       environment  variable.  This variable is set automatically by the xterm\n       terminal emulator.  However, when you log into  another  machine  on  a\n       network,  you may need to set DISPLAY by hand to point to your display.\n       For example,\n\n           % setenv DISPLAY myws:0\n           $ DISPLAY=myws:0; export DISPLAY\n\n       The ssh program can be used to start an X program on a remote  machine;\n       it automatically sets the DISPLAY variable correctly.\n\n       Finally,  most X programs accept a command line option of -display dis‐\n       playname to temporarily override the contents of DISPLAY.  This is most\n       commonly used to pop windows on another person's screen or as part of a\n       \"remote shell\" command to start an xterm pointing back to your display.\n       For example,\n\n           % xeyes -display joesws:0 -geometry 1000x1000+0+0\n           % rsh big xterm -display myws:0 -ls </dev/null &\n\n       X  servers  listen for connections on a variety of different communica‐\n       tions channels (network byte  streams,  shared  memory,  etc.).   Since\n       there  can be more than one way of contacting a given server, The host‐\n       name part of the display name is used to determine the type of  channel\n       (also  called  a transport layer) to be used.  X servers generally sup‐\n       port the following types of connections:\n\n       local\n               The hostname part of the  display  name  should  be  the  empty\n               string.   For  example:   :0, :1, and :0.1.  The most efficient\n               local transport will be chosen.\n\n       TCPIP\n               The hostname part of the display  name  should  be  the  server\n               machine's  hostname or IP address.  Full Internet names, abbre‐\n               viated names,  IPv4  addresses,  and  IPv6  addresses  are  all\n               allowed.     For    example:    x.org:0,    expo:0,    [::1]:0,\n               198.112.45.11:0, bigmachine:1, and hydra:0.1.\n\nTo get the value of your display you should just be able to run:\necho $DISPLAY\n\n\nA: In a bash script one way to find the display associated with a user is to run the command who. The useful bits in this case would be the login name and X display. \nOn a single user system you can usually safely assume that there will only be one user logged on. For a multi user server some logic may need to be applied to choose the correct display.\n# process who for a unique list of users with their display as an array\nUSERLIST=($(/usr/bin/who | /bin/sed -e 's/[)(]//g' -e 's/ \\+/ /g' | /usr/bin/cut -d ' ' -f1,5 | /usr/bin/sort -u | /usr/bin/tr -d '\\n'))\n# ${USERLIST[1]:-\":0.0\"} includes a default guess to be used if the array value is null.\nxterm -display \"${USERLIST[1]:-\":0.0\"}\"\n\n\nA: I found the solution if your using SSH, on the host machine use the command:echo $DISPLAYfollowed up on the SSH client: DISPLAY=echoedDisplay:0; export DISPLAY(echoeddisplay being the display the host machine echoed)\n", "Q: Install second network interface on virtualized Ubuntu Server I've just installed the latest Ubuntu 16.04 on a VirtualBox machine.

Be sure to only add keys of people you know can be trusted to not only provide good builds, but keep their keys safe.\n\nThere is no public key available for the following key IDs: 1397BC53640DB551\n\nI normally see this whenever my apt has software sources (ie: /etc/apt/sources.list or /etc/apt/sources.list.d/foo) which have packages for which I do not have the public key.  This means that someone has signed software and is available via apt that I have not set up as a trusted source.  \nIf you Google '1397BC53640DB551' you'll find a few other people having similar issues.  However, when I check Ubuntu's keyserver, I don't even see that key.  This makes me think that performing the apt-key adv command, you didn't actually import anything (which is fine, I just don't want you worried).\n\nI would recommend that you try to reset your sources.list.

So why do I need to change owner to www-data? some applications/scripts does not work unless owner is www-data.\nAfter changing owner to www-data then logging to FTP/SFTP by [username] I cannot change anything as \"Permission denied\".\nIs it possible to set owner to \"www-data\" and do not get \"Permission denied\"?\nIs it important to set owner to \"www-data\"?\nI understand it's apache user and group but I thought folder should be owned by website username.\n\nA: It is important. Changing the owner to www-data is a security issue. If you don't, you have to run the web server (apache) as another user. If someone is able to get control of your web server they can do anything that user can do, access files, delete files, change permissions, etc. The idea is that if you use www-data for your web server then someone who gains control of your web server won't have the permissions needed to cause much damage outside of your website. \nI believe you can allow access for your user and www-data using this method: (No \"Permission denied\" error.)\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/9133024/www-data-permissions/19620585#19620585\n", "Q: How to doubleclick a Java Jar and start it without sudo My current Situation:\n\n*\n\n*my pc is running Xubuntu 16.04\n\n*a java jar app on Xubunutu desktop\n\n*a USB thermal printer (Model: DigiPOS 920) is connected via USB to my pc\n\n*the java app talks to the thermal printer via Java-POS and not via CUPS\n\n\nMy Question:\nI am able to print but only if I have started my app via the terminal as su.

After reading the answers on this post, I saw that the glyph I want was being taken from the UnDotum font, not Font Awesome.\nHow can I change this?\nEDIT: Seems like a possible solution would be to create my own font and map the glyphs how I want using FontForge, but I'd rather avoid that due to how tedious it seems it will be and the possibility of messing up my fonts.\n\nA: Using Pango fontYou can set a list of multiple fonts to use in your ~/.i3/config, either for a specific status bar (workspace names, mode indicators and status messages) or globally (title bars and all status bars). Settings on single status bars override global settings. The first font that provides a certain glyph is then used to draw it.\nFor example:\nfont pango:DejaVu Sans Mono, UnDotum, FontAwesome 12\n\nSo if a glyph is not providede by DejaVu Sans Mono, it will be looked up in UnDotum (assuming that is the correct name used by the system) and then FontAwesome.\nYou can get a list of the installed fonts with fc-list and look up the correct name there. For example with fc-list | grep -i dotum.\n\nIf you generally prefer FontAwesome but want to use UnDotum for a specific workspace, you also can use Pango markup to change the font only for it. For example:\nset $WORKSPACE_X <span font=\"UnDotum 12\">[GLYPH]</span>\nworkspace $WORKSPACE_X output SOME-DISPLAY\nbindkey $mod+x workspace $WORKSPACE_X\nbindkey $mod+Shift+x move to workspace $WORKSPACE_X\n\nThis will show the the workspace name as \"[GLYPH]\" with font UnDotum, the markup will not be shown. Replace [GLYPH] with whatever text you want. I strongly suggest using variables for workspace names in order to ensure the exact same name and markup on all occurences.\n", "Q: internet connection and ubuntu shutdown I was having trouble connecting to the internet,so I proceeded to connect directly via a cable.

At least, this is the correct syntax.  An additional problem is that you are trying to add a mode to a disconnected port \"VGA-0 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)\" which won't work.  The port has to be connected first.\nJudging from what the post says, you're probably using an incorrect port though.  Your VGA-0 port is for connecting an actual monitor through a 15-pin VGA connector.\n", "Q: Mouse becomes unusable after Corsair Headset I am running Ubuntu 16.04LTS (You can view the system details here) on my PC and have recently experienced an apparent common fault - when turning on the Corsair Void Headset, my mouse becomes unusable (as in, clicking links has no effect). \nHere is the result of a lshw for the Void Headset (mouse and keyboard):\n          *-usb:0\n               description: Human interface device\n               product: Corsair VOID RGB Wireless Gaming Headset\n               vendor: Corsair\n               physical id: 2\n               bus info: usb@3:2\n               version: 0.00\n               capabilities: usb-1.10\n               configuration: driver=usbhid maxpower=500mA speed=12Mbit/s\n          *-usb:1\n               description: Mouse\n               product: Corsair Gaming Scimitar RGB Mouse\n               vendor: Corsair\n               physical id: 3\n               bus info: usb@3:3\n               version: 2.03\n               serial: 15032016AEAA1003550F1E8AF5001942\n               capabilities: usb-2.00\n               configuration: driver=usbhid maxpower=300mA speed=12Mbit/s\n         *-usb:3\n               description: Keyboard\n               product: Corsair K95 RGB Gaming Keyboard\n               vendor: Corsair\n               physical id: 9\n               bus info: usb@3:9\n               version: 2.04\n               serial: 1300C019AE3D8C805397BBE7F5001947\n               capabilities: usb-2.00\n               configuration: driver=usbhid maxpower=500mA speed=12Mbit/s\n\nFor the actual USB controller, I can provide the following:\n         *-usb:2\n         description: USB controller\n         product: 9 Series Chipset Family USB EHCI Controller #1\n         vendor: Intel Corporation\n         physical id: 1d\n         bus info: pci@0000:00:1d.0\n         version: 00\n         width: 32 bits\n         clock: 33MHz\n         capabilities: pm debug ehci bus_master cap_list\n         configuration: driver=ehci-pci latency=0\n         resources: irq:23 memory:f7a1a000-f7a1a3ff\n       *-usbhost\n            product: EHCI Host Controller\n            vendor: Linux 4.4.0-22-generic ehci_hcd\n            physical id: 1\n            bus info: usb@2\n            logical name: usb2\n            version: 4.04\n            capabilities: usb-2.00\n            configuration: driver=hub slots=2 speed=480Mbit/s\n          *-usb\n               description: USB hub\n               vendor: Intel Corp.\n               physical id: 1\n               bus info: usb@2:1\n               version: 0.00\n               capabilities: usb-2.00\n               configuration: driver=hub slots=8 speed=480Mbit/s\n\nFull hardware list can be located here.

I am running Ubuntu Desktop (so, there's the graphical interface that I'm using). When I double click a '.sh' file, I was expecting it to run. However, it opened up gedit instead. I enabled the permission to execute the file, and I've tried to find a program called 'terminal' or 'bash' to execute the script with, and found nothing that looks like I could use it to execute the BASH script.\nCould someone please tell me what I need to do, in order to be able to double click on a BASH script (or, at least right click and run with bash or something like that) and run it?\n\nA: You need to mark it as an executable, you can do so by right-clicking on the file then click Properties > Permissions > Then check the box next to allow executing file as program. Then it should ask you to run it or view it if you double-click on it. If not you you should look at what @bharadwaj-raju said. If all else fails you can open a terminal by hitting Ctril + Alt + T and cd-ing into the directory.

It sounds like you would be connecting to public wifi to provide internet access to your vpn and this will not make your communications secure.\nYou would have unencrypted communication between the public WIFI and the VPN. Because your virtualbox would be using the same public WIFI to connect to websites. You need to connect to the vpn over the public WIFI to provide security.  \nIdeally, you would want to set up a VPN on a trusted network like your home network for example.\nThen, you could use the public WIFI to connect remotely to your VPN server computer that is connected to your home network (at your apartment or house). This would encrypt all traffic on the public WIFI because the public WIFI would not be used to connect to websites, only to the VPN.\n", "Q: Can't SSH to machine on Local Network (time out), can SSH from ouside LAN I have a Box 'foo' which has sshd running.

From there you can run gparted by typing on the commandline sudo gparted. It opens a gparted window and from there you can resize, delete and add partitions without interfering with the program partioning so you can unmount all.\n", "Q: Drag selecting text fails I am running Wily 15.10 with the MATE desktop.\nI'm not sure entirely when this started happening, it may have just been after a sudo apt-get update && apt-get upgrade, but it had to have been at least a week ago I think.\nI didn't understand the problem at first, I thought it might be a hardware issue. And it was merely annoying, and I had important things to do I guess.\nThe issue seems to be that none of the programs that I use, including MATE Terminal, Pluma text editor, or Firefox, recognize a drag-select operation anymore. This includes, text in the text editor, text anywhere in the console terminal, text on a webpage, text in a text entry form on a webpage, or text in the address bar of the webbrowser.\nThey all recognize, double clicking on text to select a word or an entire line. They all recognize the \"select all\" option. And they can actually do copy paste. It's only that drag-selecting appears to have been disabled somehow.\nI also cannot properly drag windows around by dragging their title bars. It's as though the click always misses or isn't recognized. I can only manipulate their positions now by minimizing or maximizing them.\nHow does one go about troubleshooting an issue like this?\nI've been using Ubuntu for about 8 years, and I never had a problem like this, so I'm somewhat at a loss.\n\nEdit:\nI can give a somewhat more detailed description.\nWhen I mouse over some text in say a static webpage, my cursor changes from the \"normal\" arrow symbol, to the text-cursor symbol, which normally is the cue to me that this is some text I could highlight. However, if I actually press the mouse key and drag the cursor left or right, the text is simply not actually highlighted.\n\nA: After more fiddling with this, this is what I have determined...\nIn this Lenovo machine, there is a clickpad rather than a touchpad. There are also, for some reason, physical click buttons located above the clickpad.\nNormally I just use the clickpad to click I guess, but sometimes I use the physical buttons.\nIt appears that the physical buttons just aren't always recognized properly for dragging. If I click the pad and drag the cursor, then I can select and drag things just fine. If I click the button and drag the cursor, that just doesn't seem to count, although double clicking the physical buttons works.\nSo this is most likely some kind of hardware configuration issue I guess... sorry for posting a problem that has an obscure resolution like this, maybe it helps someone else...\n", "Q: ralink rt3290 driver module not launching and I can't figure out why I have an HP Envy 15 with the RT3290 from ralink.

It loads for a little while but then goes back to nothing. A red highlight says this program comes from a 3rd party and may contain non free components.\n\nA: I assume you are talking about downloaded .deb files which you simply doubleclick to install.

Recently i had refreshed windows 8.1 and since then i am unable to see Grub menu while i boot. However if i go to BIOS settings and then select the UBUNTU only then the GRub menu appears.\n\nA: It looks like you have two physical disks in your computer. \nIf you install a Windows over a Linux you overwirte the bootloader because Windows does not recognize any other OS. Only thing you can do is set the Linux HDD as default in your BIOS/EFI and use grub to boot Windows.\nOr you could install grub4dos in your Windows and add your Linux partition to the menu. So it doesn't matter from which HDD you boot. Both bootloaders have both entries.\n", "Q: How to view the all command in man page 8 I try to view all the commands in man page 8 using terminal by this code man man 8, but it only shows man(1).\nSo I tried another method man 8 man but it says No manual entry for man in section 8 See 'man 7 undocumented' for help when manual pages are not available.\nHow can I view all commands in man page 8?\n\nA: I believe that this will get you a list of every man page in section 8:\napropos -s 8 . | less\n\nThe option -s 8 restricts the search to section 8.

Or should I use shutter or sth?\n\nSo not spaces of the same screen, but dual monitor system two screens.\n\nA: To only shoot the current screen is not the default behaviour, nor is it an option in gnome-screenshot, nor any other screenshot application as far as I know.\nLike practically anything however, it can be scripted. \nAn example\nThe script further below will:\n\n\n*\n\n*take a screenshot\n\n*automatically create a (numbered) image in an arbitrary directory\n\n*automatically crop the image to the section of the screen you are currently on (retrieved from the mouse position), and create a cropped image named: \ncropped_<image>.png\n\nTo prevent overwriting earlier screenshots, these cropped images are numbered like their oroginals.\nscreenshot\n\nif I am on the left screen: \n\nif I am on the right screen: \n\nThe script\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport os\nfrom PIL import Image\nimport subprocess\n\n# ---set the name of your (automatically numbered) screenshots (no extension)\nimagename = \"screenshot\"\n# ---set the path to where you (want to) save your screenshots\nsavepath = \"/home/jacob/Bureaublad\"\n\ndef get(cmd):\n    return subprocess.check_output(cmd).decode(\"utf-8\")\n\nn = 1 \nwhile True:\n    name = imagename+\"_\"+str(n)+\".png\"\n    path = os.path.join(savepath, name)\n    if os.path.exists(path):\n        n += 1\n    else:\n        break\n\n# make the shot\nsubprocess.call([\"gnome-screenshot\", \"-f\", path])\n# get the width of the left screen\nscreenborder = [int(n) for n in [s for s in get(\"xrandr\").split()\\\n                if \"+0+0\" in s][0].split(\"+\")[0].split(\"x\")]\n# read the screenshot\nim = Image.open(path)\nwidth, height = im.size\n# get the mouse position\nmousepos = int(get([\"xdotool\", \"getmouselocation\"]).split()[0].split(\":\")[1])\ntop = 0\nbottom = height\n\nif mousepos <= screenborder[0]:\n    left = 0\n    right = screenborder[0]\nelse:\n    left = screenborder[0]\n    right = width\n# create the image\nim.crop((left, top, right, bottom)).save(os.path.join(savepath, \"cropped_\"+name))\n\nHow to use\n\n\n*\n\n*The script needs xdotool, to get the mouse position:\nsudo apt-get install xdotool\n\nFurthermore, not sure if python3-pil is installed by default:\nsudo apt-get install python3-pil\n\n\n*Copy the script above into an empty file, save it as crop_screenshot.py\n\n*In the head section of the script, set the desired name of the screenshot and the directory you use for your screenshots:\n# ---set the name of your (automatically numbered) screenshots (no extension)\nimagename = \"screenshot\"\n# ---set the path to where you (want to) save your screenshots\nsavepath = \"/home/jacob/Bureaublad\"\n\n\n*Test- run the script from a terminal:\npython3 /path/to/crop_screenshot.py\n\nThe result:\n\n\n*If all works fine, add it to a shortcut. Choose: System Settings > \"Keyboard\" > \"Shortcuts\" > \"Custom Shortcuts\". Click the \"+\" and add the command:\npython3 /path/to/crop_screenshot.py\n\nNote\nThe script, as it is, simply splits the image on the width of your left screen. This is sufficient, because your screens are of the same y-resolution and aligned. \nThe script can however very well be edited to work with any screen arrangement, with any number of screens, as long as the screens are arranged in a non-overlapping arrangement. The math is a bit more complicated in that case however. \nIf anyone is interested, I will add it later.\n\nA: Not withstanding the elegant script above, on ubuntu 16.04 I found that alt-print-screen, as desribed in:\nPrint Screen captures two Spaces not one\nworks. \nActually this just prints the current window. If the aim is to capture a background I don't think it will work.\n\nA: One option is to press Shift + PrtSc and then drag the cross from one corner of the monitor to the other corner. Release and it takes a screenshot of that area.\n", "Q: $PATH problem in 16.04 \"WARNING: your PATH doesn't contain ...\" I use ubuntu 16.04 and trying to install a simulator (Omnet++).\nWhen I try and configure, it gives the below warning:\nWARNING: your PATH doesn't contain /home/aboubakar/omnetpp-5.0/bin!\nAdd the following line to your .profile or .bash_profile (provided you use bash):\n\n    export PATH=$PATH:/home/aboubakar/omnetpp-5.0/bin\n\nBut I already add that to : ~/.bashrc and ~/.profile\nThe output of echo $PATH:\n/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games:/home/aboubakar/omnetpp-5.0/bin:/opt/google_appengine/:/home/aboubakar/omnetpp-4.6/bin\n\nA: When you do sudo ./configure, the user that needs to have the PATH address is the sudo user. When you edit the .profile, the user is not necessarily the sudo user. Try it:\n$sudo su\n$. setenv\n$ echo $PATH #(here you can see the $PATH with the address)\n\nthen\n$ sudo ./configure\n\nI have exactly the same problem.\n\nA: I had the same problem. The solution that finally worked for me in 16.04 was to add the command to /etc/profile, so sudo nano /etc/profile and then at the bottom add\nexport PATH=$PATH:/home/aboubakar/omnetpp-5.0/bin\nsave and exit and then\nsource /etc/profile\n@Volcan300 after doing this, if you sudo su your are correct the variables won't be applied.

So far it has been a good experience.\nHowever, one of the main things that was worrying me was the fact that I maybe could not control the fan speed as I was able to with Windows 10. Acer had released some time ago a utility to control the fan speed and it worked wonderfully.\nThankfully however, I managed to find a perl script that does the exact same thing on Linux, and it works like a charm when I run it with sudo, however, whenever I simply run it without sudo, it gives me an access denied message about /dev/port.\n\nI want to be able to run this script without root access and even write a bash script for it (Maybe even a complete port with a GUI like the original Acer app), but as long as this /dev/port issue remains, I can't do anything because I will always need to enter my password.\nI have searched and I am indeed a member of the dialout group, having restarted and relogging multiple times, but even that doesn't help me.\nI have also tried looking at the source code of this perl script but I just can't wrap my head around it, seeing as it has a lot of assembly magic.\n\nSo my question is this: I want to execute a perl script that requires access to /dev/port without running it using sudo, but even if I am in the dialout group, it still gives me the error. What am I doing wrong?\nMy guess is that the ports that this script needs do not belong to the dialout group but some other group, like tty, but I can't add myself to the tty group.\nRegardless, thanks.\n\nA: on my system:\namias@rome:~$  ls -l /dev/port\ncrw-r----- 1 root kmem 1, 4 May 27 10:53 /dev/port\n\nThis suggests that you need to run it via sudo, i would also resist the temptation to open up the permissions to /dev/port as it will weaken your security.\nWhat you could do is configure sudo to allow you to run that script as root without a password.\nsudo visudo                # launch the safe sudo config editor\n\nthen add the following line at the bottom of the file substituting your values for user and the path to the script\nuser localhost = (root) NOPASSWD: /full/path/to/script\n\nIt would be wise to make that script be owned by root and not writable by anyone else but root, an attacker could find out that it will be run as root and could insert other commands that could compromise your system.\n", "Q: How do I add the \"atkbd.reset i8042.nomux\" parameters to rEFInd?

Recently however, I noticed that the unused space on the drives is wasted.\nFor example, if I use a 16GB USB stick and load 16.04 onto it via the Start Disk Creator tool, I get a USB stick with about 14GB unused (and unusable).\nI tried formatting the blank space using Gparted, but I get the following error:\nThe driver descriptor says the physical block size is 2048 bytes, but Linux says that it is 512 bytes.\n\nIs there a way to format the unused space and make use of it?\n\nA: So I finally found the answer after searching for a year!\nWhen you get this warning message after using USB Startup Disk Creator\n\"The driver descriptor says the physical block size is 2048 bytes, but Linux says that it is 512 bytes.\"\nMeans that the dd command in behind the nice GUI forgot to specify the bs=2048 option.\nFirst identify which drive letter the USB stick has received from the kernel\nsudo parted --list\n\nFor example this USB drive is on Device Serial Disk h: (/dev/sdh)\n\nModel: KINGSTON DataTraveler G3 (scsi)\n  Schijf /dev/sdh: 4001MB\n\nUse the information to wipe all the partition tables and data from the drive\n⚠ WARNING THIS NEXT STEP WILL DESTROY ALL DATA ON THE DRIVE ⚠\nsudo wipefs --all /dev/sdX\n\nMake sure that you have chosen the correct USB stick for the value of X so you don't accidentally wipe your harddrive/SSD\nBackground\nIt's not that the unused space is wasted. The USB disk has been corrupted by USB Startup Disk Creator.\nFor some reason USB Startup Disk Creator has become CD-ROM creator. It writes your USB-Stick to iso9660 format which is only intended for CD-ROM's.\nSince new computers don't come with CD-ROM players or writers anymore this is a regression bug and has been reported here:\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/usb-creator/+bug/1708881\n\nA: Some startup disk creators like universal usb installer can create some space to put documents and other programs, that stay after rebooting from the live usb. You can set this size and use more of your usb that way.\nI don't know of any way to put files alongside your bootable iso and still have it work. \nResizing the partition probably won't make a difference, and the startup disk creator chooses a partition table that apparently only allows for 1 primary partition, so i seem to be unable to create another partition in the unnalocated space. It seems that the only option is to use universal usb installer (or any other live usb creator that supports this) to create larger space for persistent storage.\n", "Q: What is the difference between Windows UEFI bootmgfw.efi and Windows UEFI bkpbootx64.efi? Also help me by explaining why windows UEFI loader was first taking me to windows but now is redirecting back to this page:\n\n\nA: Usually nothing. \nThe bkpbootx64.efi is a backup regularly created by Boot-Repair. With Windows the bootx64.efi is just really a copy of Windows bootmgfw.efi. And bootx64.efi is a fallback or hard drive boot entry in UEFI.\nBut Boot-Repair with its 'Use the standard EFI file` in advanced options creates the bkpbootx64.efi and makes bootx64.efi a copy of shimx64.efi so fallback or hard drive boot entry in UEFI really boots grub not Windows.\nAbout the only way to tell which is which is by checking file size or what actually boots. If Boot-Repair created 25_custom for all the HP entries you probably can delete most or all of them.\nEdit 25_custom entries created by Boot-Repair:\nsudo cp -a /etc/grub.d/25_custom /etc/grub.d/bkp25_custom\n\nturn off execute bit or it will run backup also\nsudo chmod a-x /etc/grub.d/bkp25_custom\nsudo nano /etc/grub.d/25_custom\n\nThen do:\nsudo update-grub\n\n", "Q: 16.04 Delete key not working I noticed I cannot delete with the delete key, which was working fine in win 10.

The amount of space occupied at the time of that free command was 0 bytes.  That is, the programs you were running at the time fitted into available memory and nothing needed to be paged out to the swap space.  This is a desirable condition -- your system will run much faster when no swapping is occurring, vs when it is.\nRegarding priority, -1 is an ok number.  If you only have one swap device allocated, in general its priority makes no difference; when there's only one swap unit, that's the unit that will be used for swapping.\nIf you have multiple swap units and want to use one before another, either specify higher priority numbers (as described in previous answer and in man swapon) for units to be used sooner, and lower priority numbers for units to be used later, or in /etc/fstab just list the devices in order in the file.  Earlier-listed means earlier-used for entries given without priority numbers.  \n\nA: for the answer to: how it's a negative priority, see the last point\n\nIf you have enough RAM, your system probably doesn't need the swap at the moment.\nThere is not much to do, no options to change.\nYou should only worry if you're getting out of space errors.\nSo the answer is; your settings look good, let it be.\nThere are few cases, where changing setting, like priority, from default (set at install time) might be useful.\nIf you have multiple space volumes, and your fastest is of limited size.\nOr if you're occasionally out of memory, but it's not worth to make the main swap bigger.\nor a case where a NAS server (the one I have) has swap in raid1 mirrored to all disks, so any could be taken out on the run, but to not waste too much space the ultimate big swap is a file on just one selected volume.\nbut I actually wanted to add some side points:\n\n\n*\n\n*/etc/fstab does not need to contain your swap volume setting. it might be set by a command in one of the init files.\n\n*cat /proc/swaps might be a better way to get the swap info,\nor swapon --summary which should show the same on some swapon versions\n\n*and for the dilemma of negative priority.\nas per manual: priority is a value between 0 and 32767.\nhow come there are negative numbers in /proc/swaps?\nit just means, the swap was set without specifying an explicit priority  \n\nIf you don't add a priority yourself, the kernel generates a number\n  for you. And those numbers are negative.\n\nhttps://lists.debian.org/debian-user/2002/09/msg01075.html \nyour -1 priority is ok and because it's the only swap entry, the priority has no effect.\n", "Q: ATA Secure Erase - password set - not locked Today I tried to wipe my ssd using ATA Secure Erase (with an Ubuntu live sytem).

So I tried again with a different password.\nsudo hdparm --user-master u --security-set-pass 0000 /dev/sda\n\nthe output made me think that setting the password was successful\nsecurity_password: \"0000\"\n\n/dev/sda:\nIssuing SECURITY_SET_PASS command, password=\"\", user=user, mode=high\n\nBut actually it just says that the SECURITY_SET_PASS command has been issued and nothing about success or failure.\nFailed attempts to erase the disk\nAfterwards I tried erasing with\nhdparm --user-master u --security-erase 0000 /dev/sda\n\nwhich gave me \nsecurity_password: \"0000\"\n/dev/sda: Permission denied\n\nSince that did not work I figured that the second attempt at password setting was probably not successful and thus I used\nhdparm --user-master u --security-erase NULL /dev/sda\n\nto my suprise I just got permission denied again\nsecurity_password: \"\"\n/dev/sda: Permission denied\n\nAtempts to fix the problem\nThen I reasearched a bit and read about the --security-disable option here: https://ata.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/ATA_Secure_Erase\nand it also said not to use an empty string or NULL there :/\nThe following attempts\nsudo hdparm --security-disable 0000\nsudo hdparm --security-disable NULL\nsudo hdparm --security-disable PWD\nsudo hdparm --security-disable \"\"\nsudo hdparm --security-disable\n\nall resulted in the output\nmissing PASSWD\n\nCurrent state of the disk\nSecurity: \n       Master password revision code = 65534\n               supported\n               enabled\n       not     locked\n       not     frozen\n       not     expired: security count\n               supported: enhanced erase\n       Security level high\n       2min for SECURITY ERASE UNIT. 2min for ENHANCED SECURITY ERASE UNIT.\n\nIt says not locked in the security part and I did not reboot yet thus I still have a little bit of hope left. \nThe question\nI assume the user password is set to the empty string. Is it somehow possible to get rid of the password and save my ssd?\nThanks in advance if anyone has an idea :)\n\nA: My initial intention was to merely comment, but then I was told my reputation isn't high enough to do that. Anyway, let me begin by clarifying that I am by no means an experienced Linux user. That said, I did actually manage to tackle a similar issue I was facing up until the day before yesterday. \nIn my case, I did a reboot before long, which I guess you too have done by now, and that rendered my ssd not only security enabled but also locked.\nI wouldn't know about the security-disable command, but the security-unlock appears to be a bit buggy (can't say I understand much of that).\nWhat worked for me was to issue\nsudo hdparm --user-master m --security-erase \"\" /dev/sda\n\nNOTE: Mine is a Kingston SSD, in which case the master password is apparently set to NULL by default. Depending on the manufacturer you should replace it with the appropriate master-password. I've found a potentially useful list here, which I have, however, not tested, since Kingston was not included and I had to look elsewhere.\nNOTE 2: The aforementioned command will obviously erase all data from your disk, including whatever user password you have set, setting security back to not enabled.\nNOTE 3: I have been told that I should not try this more than 5 times per power cycle. I've also been told that rebooting may not be enough to enter a fresh power cycle, although in my case, it seems to have been.\n", "Q: Rhythmbox starts muted at launch.

You can change this based on your screensaver settings.\n#!/bin/bash\n\n#Get DPMS settings\ndpms_set=$(xset -q | awk '/DPMS is/ {print $NF}')\n\n#Get screensaver type and command\nscrnsvr=$(ps -ef | awk '/screensav/ {print $8}' | grep -v awk)\nscrnsvrcmd=$(ps -ef | awk '/screensav/ {print substr($0,index($0,$8))}' | grep -v awk)\n\n#Sleep Timer in seconds.\nSL=600\n\nwhile true;\ndo\nresult=()\n#Get all window geometries\nall=($(xdotool search --name - | while read win; do xdotool getwindowgeometry $win | awk '/Geometry/ {print $2}'; done))\n\n#Get all screen resolutions detected and build array.\nSCREENS=($(xrandr | awk '/\\*/ {print $1}'))\n\nSCRN=\" ${SCREENS[*]} \"\n\n#Get result of all windows and match\n\nfor item in ${all[@]}; do if [[ $SCRN =~ \" $item \" ]] ; then result+=($item); fi; done\n\n#If a result exists disable power management and screensaver\nif [[ ${result[@]} ]]; then\n    ps -ef | grep $scrnsvr | grep -v grep >/dev/null\n    if [[ $? == 0 ]]; then \n    kill $(ps -ef | grep $scrnsvr | grep -v grep | awk '{print $2}')\n    fi\n    if [[ $dpms_set == \"Enabled\" ]];then\n    xset -dpms\n    fi\nelse    \n    ps -ef | grep $scrnsvr | grep -v grep >/dev/null\n    if [[ $? == 1 ]]; then\n    ${scrnsvrcmd} &\n    fi\n    if [[ $dpms_set != \"Disabled\" ]];then\n        xset dpms\n        fi\nfi\nresult=()\nsleep $SL\ndone\n\nmake the script executable:\nchmod +x ~/scripts/check_full.bsh\n\nFor some reason, a cron job would not run this correctly.  So I added an entry to my startup to call this script.    In the ~/.config/autostart/ folder, I created a file called Check_full.desktop with the following content: \nI like to have delays added to startup as they usually load better.\n[Desktop Entry]\nType=Application\nName=Check_Full\nComment=Prevent screensaver from activating when full screen video is playing\nExec=bash -c 'sleep 5 && /home/<username>/scripts/check_full.bsh'\n\nchange above Exec line to match your home folder.\nSet proper permissions to the file:\nchmod 664 ~/.config/autostart/Check_full.desktop\n\nAfter logging out and back in, check_full.bsh is now running and checking every 10 minutes if active application is full screen.  If not, screensaver / lock screen launch at normal times.\nHope this helps!\n\nA: Youtube doesn't have that problem because it uses HTML5 player. The sites you're having the problem with are using Flash Player instead. It is a bug in Adobe Flashplayer, which, in short, is that it never notifies WM that it ran into fullscreen. You may have heard though that Adobe Flash is a buggy app in general, so one workaround is to disable it, and use only sites with HTML5 video.\nAs you mentioned caffeine, you probably have searched for a solution already. Another thing you could do is to disable «power saving» completely, i.e. to force the screen to never turn off.\n", "Q: converting a usb ntfs drive to ext3/4? I currently have 3 external USB drives in NTFS mounted to my Ubuntu box that i just took off my windows box. Looking to permanently convert them to a Nix partition but i dont have the spare hard drive space to back up, format, restore the data.\nReferring to this existing article... \nConvert filesystem NTFS -> EXT4?\nThe top answer is referring to using parted magic to convert the partitions to ext3/4, does this micro-distro work with external USB drives?\nI have ZERO issue buying if it serves my purpose but there is no demo and its doesn't explicitly say its USB functional other then to boot from it.\nMany Thanks\n\nA: There is no tool that will \"convert\" a NTFS file system to EXT4 in place. Even if it existed, it would be extremely dangerous. Handling data is serious business, I guess you do not want to play russian roulette with your important files.\nThe procedure described in that answer can be replicated manually but it is still a workaround and it will only work if you have some free space on the drive. \"Some\" means slightly more than the size of the biggest file you have.\nNevertheless, the answer is pretty clear:\n\nit is very risky and very time consuming\n\nYou have been warned.\nRegarding Parted Magic:\n\nDoes this micro-distro work with external USB drives?\n\nSure, it's a Linux distro. It has excellent support for USB drives and many kinds of file systems.\n", "Q: TensorFlow for Python 3 throws an error when installing on Ubuntu Today I was attempting to install Google's TensorFlow for Python 3 without GPU.

Have installed Ubuntu along side Windows 8 and also have run boot repair ,but have to press escape and F9 to boot Ubuntu. The number of Ubuntu boot entries keeps increasing after every restart, why?\n\n\nA: How often do you restart?\nPeriodically, Ubuntu will provide an update to the Linux kernel that underlies Ubuntu. Because that's such a core component of the OS, it leaves the option to boot into the previous kernel version, to mitigate against the slim chance that the new kernel version has issues.

After upgrading to Ubuntu GNOME 16.04 with GNOME 3.20 I have found that if I tap my touchpad it clicks which is something I do not want due to a faulty touchpad, previously I was able to disable this through the gnome-control-center, but seemingly there is no way to do this any more through there, so how do I do it? Also, even though it is set to false in gsettings and the dconf-editor seemingly for some reason somewhere in the system it is also set to true as it is behaving as such. I am also unable to set natural scrolling or any of the other touchpad settings seemingly, why not?\n\nA: To be able to set these settings through Terminal or through the gnome-control-center you need to make sure that you have xserver-xorg-input-libinput installed. It appears to be a bug that it is not already installed by default, in order to install simply run:\nsudo apt-get install xserver-xorg-input-libinput\n\nAfter doing so and then logging out and in again you will find new settings in the gnome-control-center's Mouse & Touchpad settings:\n\nYou should now also be able to set the touchpad settings through the dconf-editor and gsettings in Terminal.\n\nRelated: LP Bug #1586657\n\nA: I just installed gnome-control-center in Unity, and the tap-to-click check box is there, just to the left of two finger scroll and natural scrolling. \n\n", "Q: Pipelight flash plugin installation doesnt work with 16.04 I have recently installed 16.04 as a replacement for a 14.04.\nReinstalling flash plugin with pipelight, I have followed the french ubuntu page for installing pipelight.

Makes absolutely no sense to me!\n\nA: You sometimes see old information because a cache is used.\nWe'd like the message to be up-to-date, but we also don't want to block on giving you a prompt while determining the update status. For example, you might be trying to log in to fix some unrelated fault causing excessive disk I/O; it would be frustrating if you couldn't do so quickly because logging in insisted on creating more disk I/O while update status is checked, when you don't even care about that to fix your disk I/O fault.\nThe point of the message is a reminder to install updates if you don't have automatic updates enabled and if you haven't logged in for a while. If you have just installed updates yourself, or want to query the exact up-to-the-minute information, you should use apt-get directly as you have done.\nThe message comes from the update-notifier-common package via /etc/update-motd/90-updates-available. To minimise login time, the script uses a cache. If the cache is considered stale, the information is updated. If the cache is not considered stale, for example if the information was recently updated, then the information is not updated.\nIn 16.04, we have adjusted the details again in favour of not slowing down login at all.\n\nA: What are the contents of /usr/lib/update-notifier/update-motd-updates-available ?\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/update-motd/+bug/766827\nComments #14, #18,

fan speed temporarily to 100% Question: Is there a program or an easy way (bash script) to set the fan speed to 100% for some time, for example a console program like setfanspeedtomax, such that when I press ^C, the fan is controlled automatically again? (I don't want to change the automatic fan control profile.)\nBackground: I have an ASUS UX501JW-CN245T laptop, Debian 8. The standard fan profile works fine but whenever I use oclHashcat with CUDA, the GPU temperature exceeds 90°C which can be avoided by setting the fan speed to maximum: When I tried to use pwmconfig, I got some error\nroot@UX501JW:/# pwmconfig\n# pwmconfig revision 6166 (2013-05-01)\nThis program will search your sensors for pulse width modulation (pwm)\ncontrols, and test each one to see if it controls a fan on\nyour motherboard. Note that many motherboards do not have pwm\ncircuitry installed, even if your sensor chip supports pwm.\n\nWe will attempt to briefly stop each fan using the pwm controls.\nThe program will attempt to restore each fan to full speed\nafter testing. However, it is ** very important ** that you\nphysically verify that the fans have been to full speed\nafter the program has completed.\n\nFound the following devices:\n   hwmon0 is acpitz\n   hwmon1 is coretemp\n   hwmon2 is asus\n\nFound the following PWM controls:\n   hwmon2/pwm1           current value: 85\nhwmon2/pwm1 is currently setup for automatic speed control.\nIn general, automatic mode is preferred over manual mode, as\nit is more efficient and it reacts faster. Are you sure that\nyou want to setup this output for manual control? (n) y\n\nGiving the fans some time to reach full speed...\nFound the following fan sensors:\n   hwmon2/fan1_input     current speed: 0 ... skipping!\n\nThere are no working fan sensors, all readings are 0.\nMake sure you have a 3-wire fan connected.\nYou may also need to increase the fan divisors.\nSee doc/fan-divisors for more information.\n\nand the fan went on full speed and stayed like that for some reason.

I need run it like that only when i'm activate the Nvidia.\nSo, how i can create a new command on a desktop and run steam on nvidia without a terminal?\n\nA: Paste this:\n\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=Steam with NVidia\nExec=LD_LIBRARY_PATH=\"$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/lib32/nvidia-361/:/usr/lib/nvidia-361/\" steam\nTerminal=false\nIcon=steam\nType=Application\nCategories=Game;\n\n...into a file called steamnvidia.desktop and put it in the directory /usr/local/share/applications. You should see other .desktop files in there that will have a similar structure to this. Make sure this file is executable (chmod +x steamnvidia.desktop), and you will probably need root powers to get it into the folder above.\nNow search in dash (may take a couple times searching for it to reindex) \"Steam with NVidia\", as the Name= line in the file shows.\nIf you have to change the execution line for whatever reason, change the Exec= line to what you need.\nYou might also need to give the full steam path, not sure if environmental variables will work in desktop files.\n", "Q: My ext4 disk is bigger on the outside Successfully installed a clean 16.04 onto a Hybrid Disk (Seagate® Laptop Thin SSHD) on an HP Laptop that previously refused to run without Windows.\nAll Ubuntu tools, gparted, disks, nautilus tell me there are ~7Gb of space used but when I try to backup the partition with a Free Macrium Reflect Recovery USB it tells me its ~27Gb.\nI have tried older versions of Macrium and all say the same, with the prior Ubuntu 14.04 (ext3) on a NON hybrid drive this was not an issue.\nAny ideas on how to solve this \"Bigger on the Outside\" issue?\n\nA: Each partition has a part reserved for root.

I then created a symlink on /boot/grub to /mnt/boot/grub. I am using grub2's builtin crypto modules to unlock my crypt-luks container with:\nGRUB_ENABLE_CRYPTODISK=y\n\nI am also using two scripts and an extra keyfile on my luks container to bypass a second password prompt. The first being created by grub to boot the disk and the second created by luks to unlock the disk. I used this tutorial here.\nThe issue I am having is: when I boot the machine I am presented with a password prompt from grub, but this prompt is broken. If I enter the passphrase correctly it will not boot. I have to use the escape key to view the grub menu and select the correct entry which will then give me the same prompt, but this time it will accept the key. \nHow can I make the correct entry boot automatically instead of the broken prompt?\n\nA: The chances of anyone else ever having this problem are slim (maybe if someone followed the same guide), but here is how I solved it.\nUsing grub-customizer, I reverted the grub menu to default. Make sure that the menu entry you wish to use is script: linux not script: custom. Then I removed the \"Advanced options for Ubuntu\" and deleted my old entry. Save and reload the configuration, and bravo! The first prompt now works for decryption.\n", "Q: Dell DA200 Adapter not working on Ubuntu I have Dell XPS15, dual booting with Windows 10 and Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (novice to Linux), which came with a Type-C USB. I just bought a Dell DA200 adapter for the USB which works on Windows but doesn't on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. I checked by running 'lsusb' with and without the adapter and confirmed the problem. Could someone please suggest a solution? Thank you.\n\nA: This is apparently fixed in the 4.5 linux kernel\nhttps://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=92932\nhttp://ubuntuhandbook.org/index.php/2016/03/upgrade-linux-kernel-4-5-ubuntu/\n\nA: contrary to what the other answers to this question suggest, the da200 adapter is not a displaylink device (unlike its predecessor, i believe). it's a \"docking station\" adapter that connects to the usb-c port, and provides hdmi, vga, ethernet, and usb ports.\ncurrently there seems to be a problem with the graphics on this device. the laptop does see an external screen, but it will remain black. only when a low resolution is chosen (usually much lower than the preferred resolution of the monitor or tv that is attached) the display \"works\".\nmore information and details about this issue is available from these bug reports:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=93578\n\n*https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=94567\n\nA: Try using the latest compatible kernel (i'm using 4.7.0-rc7 and it's working). You could also try to leave the plug inside the computer and reboot (still plugged).\nIn my case, VGA is not working (Linux nor Windows) but the other plugs are working fine.\n\nA: As per the following bug it seeems to have been fixed.\nIf it still doesn't work for you check the kernel version uname -a.\nIn my case I was checking for any updates on the issue thinking it wasn't solved however when I tried it it simply worked.\nAccording to this post on Dell commpunity someone got it to work with a patch for kernel 4.13 which I happen to have. I did not patch though.\nIf it's not urgent I suggest you wait for the next kernel image update.\n", "Q: how does adding a ppa with a curl command work?

One of the methods was installing it via ppa.\ncurl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup | sudo bash -\n\nHe used the above command to add the ppa. How does it work?\n\nA: Explanation of the line: \ncurl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup | sudo bash -\n\n\n\n*\n\n*curl flags and options:\n-s <==> Silent mode  \n-L <==> or --location, will follow redirects\n\n\n*sudo bash:\nThe minus sign behind sudo bash in fact means take the input comming from the pipe and treat it as a bash script. and that is exactly what this link contains, a bash script, you could as well use this line:\nwget -O- https://deb.nodesource.com/setup | sudo bash -\n\nWhich will do exact the same.\n\nA: Looking at https://deb.nodesource.com/setup, the following two lines of code add the apt repository for you when you run the script:\nexec_cmd \"echo 'deb https://deb.nodesource.com/node_0.10 ${DISTRO} main' > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/nodesource.list\"\nexec_cmd \"echo 'deb-src https://deb.nodesource.com/node_0.10 ${DISTRO} main' >> /etc/apt/sources.list.d/nodesource.list\"\n\n\nA: You grant the shell script hosted at this address full access rights to your computer, which it then uses to add the source.\nBy omitting the | sudo bash - part, the commands that would be executed are instead shown, so you can review them, ideally before executing them.\n", "Q: 16.04 won't boot after latest updates I bought a Dell 17-5755 ten days ago and have been slowly configuring it. Came with Win 8.1, which I first upgraded to Win 10. Then shrank the primary partition to make room for Ubu and installed 16.04. Both have been running fine for the last week. \nYesterday, I started shifting over to the new machine in earnest, setting up Thunderbird and migrating from Evolution. While I was doing this, a notification popped up for a software update, so I started the software updater in the background and ignored it. I thought I had auto update off and don't remember pressing install, but next I looked it had updated and was asking to restart, so I've no idea what the updates were. I was in the middle of something, so pressed restart later. Later came and I restarted from the shutdown menu. The grub menu came up as usual, but I can't boot to Ubuntu and get the following:\n/dev/sda6: recovery journal\n\n/dev/sda6: clean, 229524/107610112 files, 10311615/430426112 blocks\n\n[   10.174300] tpm_crb MSFT0101:00: can't request region for resource [mem 0x9d899000-0x9d899fff]\n\nThen it hangs, but something is going on as the fan starts winding up 10-15 seconds later. At this point all I can do it hard power off.\nWin 10 still boots fine. The Ubu kernel is still 4.4.0-22, the same as before the updates. I guess I'm looking at starting over with a reinstall of 16.04, but any advice before I do that is much appreciated.\n\nA: I've had the same problem with Dell Inspiron i7559-763BLK this morning. \nI think it is not related to dual boot or hardware fault.\nAs I understand this problem is related to one of the kernel modules which was built for earlier kernel version. After kernel upgrade you need to rebuild this module or install newer version.\nCheck what kernel modules you have installed last week with your software (e.g. drivers).\nIn my case upgrading to a newer nvidia drivers solved the issue.\nWhat I did is reboot in recovery mode, uninstalled the nvidia proprietary drivers, and installed the latest one from graphics-drivers ppa:\nsudo apt purge nvidia-*\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:graphics-drivers/ppa\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt full-upgrade\nsudo apt install nvidia-378\nsudo reboot\n\n\nA: The problem must appear after install some nvidia drivers. \nIn my case, I'd installed nvidia-361 drivers. But the solution for this problem that I found was different. When the authentication failed, I pressed Ctrl + F1 and I realized that the 'PATH' variable was not set with the correctly (/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin', etc). Because of this even 'ls' command was not working anymore. So, I decide simply to set the 'PATH' variable and everything worked again. \n\nA: I persistently saw this problem with nvidia-384 driver. Each time I reboot, I got stuck at the same point. The only way I got the system to boot was by purging the Nvidia drivers in recovery mode. My system configuration is Ubuntu 16.04, kernel 4.10 0-041000-generic.\nHowever when I installed an older version nvidia-381, I was not getting stuck on boot. Its just likely that the newest version of nvidia drivers is buggy.\n", "Q: League of legends I'm having trouble installing League of Legends with playonlinux on ubuntu 16.04. \nI have had no luck so far with playonlinux.

Is it possible Ubuntu is someone how mishandling the incoming power? Is that even possible?\n\nA: So it turns out the discrepancy in temperature comes from the fact that the nvidia drivers in windows automatically switch between intel integrated graphics and the nvidia graphics card based on what the computer is running.

I have no explanation for it though, and so far I could not find information on how to solve or escape that.\nI therefore went looking for a command to get the time without using the suspected character.\nAlternatively use Ruby for the date & time\nThis lead me to Ruby, which produces the current date & time from the command:\n$ ruby -e 'puts Time.now.inspect'\n2016-05-29 16:12:36 +0200\n\nWhen we edit the output a bit with awk, removing spaces and delimiters, we have just what we want, and a working command in the .desktop file, since we don't use %:\nExec=/bin/bash -c  \"gedit ~/$(ruby -e 'puts Time.now.inspect' | awk -F'[: -]' '{print $1$2$3$4$5$6}')\"\n\n\n\nNote!\nNo doubt, the command can be \"charmed up\" a bit, I will probably edit the answer a bit today or tomorrow.\n\nA: Unfortunately, .desktop files don't always call sub-shell $() commands the way we would like them to.  One way to do this that I have found would be to create another script that contains the sub-shell command to open the file like that.\nThe Exec line would look like:\nExec=/path/to/script\n\nthen your script file would contain the command to open your new file:\n#!/bin/sh\n\ngedit ~/$(date +%Y%m%d%H%M%S).txt\n\nthe script would also have to be executable:\nchmod +x /path/to/script\n\nHope this helps!\n\nA: Since this is first google result, let me link another answer that is way simpler:\n.desktop file with date variable not working\nIn short:\n'The freedesktop standard specifies that filetype arguments use % symbol, but can be escaped via double % sign.'\nSo instead of\nExec=gedit ~/$(date +%Y%m%d%H%M%S).txt\n\nuse\nExec=gedit ~/$(date +%%Y%%m%%d%%H%%M%%S).txt\n\n", "Q: How to change the default username of mysql?

In the drop-down Menu, I selected my dummy entry first, and the entries popped into view on the Calendar.  Then I experimented by selecting Nofilter, thinking the entries might disappear, but they remained.  Probably the dummy filter was unnecessary, but I have no idea.\nAs far as I can see, in fact, there is no 'Calendar Manager' in the left-hand panel, unless that refers to a check-box to the left of the calendar icon??

This can be shown in the screenshot below:\n\nI have tried the following to resolve the issue:\n\n\n*\n\n*Using VLC's stable ppa to get a later verison of VLC (VLC media player 2.2.4 Weatherwax)\n\n*Changing from nvidia driver 361.42 to 340.96 (which didn't work so I switched back, I made sure to reboot each time). I also tried the X.Org X server - Nouveau driver.\n\n*Trying various outputs from Automatic to X11 Video Output XCB, and OpenGL GLX video output (XCB).\n\n*Changing the Hardware-accelerated decoding from Automatic to Disable (under the Input/Codecs tab)\n\n*Disabling all but my primary monitor.\n\n\nI notice that if I pause the video, skip to any location, wait a second or two, and then play, the video will be fine. I just need VLC to wait until it is ready instead of trying to plow on immediately with the audio and trying to get the video to sync up.\nOther media players like mpv media player just work in this regard, but I noticed mpv media player doesn't allow me to skip to the next video for some reason which is why I'm going back to trying to fix VLC.\nUpdate June 4th 2016\nI just installed Xubuntu on my netbook and VLC works on there perfectly well. I tried both VLC 2.2.2 and 2.2.4 from the PPA. This issue looks like its Ubuntu Desktop specific or to do with the fact that my desktop monitor runs through an Nvidia GPU (but have tested using nouveau drivers).\nAnother thing I noticed is that streaming media from a remote host on the same network using an NFS share makes the problem far more noticeable.\nUpdate 8th June 2016\nI have uploaded a youtube video trying to demonstrate the change in behaviour where the audio never stops playing as you skip around, but the video will be \"paused\" and then kick in as pixelated before eventually sorting itself out. Normally both the audio and video would kick in together once the player is ready and there would be no video pixelation as shown here in this video of Xubuntu 16.04 using VLC.\nUpdate 9th June 2016\nIt appears that videos I record using Kazam screen caster are not affected which led me to believe it was some proprietary codec or something. I revisited the decoding menu and found that only this option worked on a local file (I still had pixelation issues on the same video when it was loaded from an NFS folder but maybe that is yet another different issue?). \n\nI am guessing that the DRM option is the important point here as VA-API via X11 did not work (and neither did \"disable\" or any of the others). I would now be keen to figure out what I need to do when I'm loading the vidoes from an NFS. Increasing the stream output muxer caching didn't fix it.\nFinal Update - It's an Nvidia Issue (9th June 2016)\nThis is definitely an Nvidia graphics card related issue (haven't tested AMD). After noticing that VA-API with DRM didn't work on my work computer (which is also running Ubuntu 16.04 with an Nvidia Graphics card), when I got home I tried installing xubuntu to test that theory. That didn't do the trick. After that I unplugged my Nvidia graphics card and am now using the integrated intel graphics (on i5-4670K) which is working brilliantly on \"automatic\" and even on files loaded from the NFS. \nNormally I would post this as the answer, but I don't think many others would be happy with it. I hope that maybe someone will have a solution whereby I can plug in my graphics card again, but I think the reality is we need to wait for an update to the kernel and/or better proprietary drivers from Nvidia. What amazes me is that having the card in and using the opensource nouveau drivers, or switching off hardware acceleration doesn't work. \n\nA: I had the same annoying issue on KDE Neon (ubuntu 16.04) with nvidia graphics (GTX 1050). I am using the nvidia drivers 375.82. To resolve this issue I had to change two vlc settings:\n\n\n*\n\n*Video Settings --> Output --> X11 video output (XCB)\n\n*Codecs --> Hardware accelerated decoding --> VA-API video decoder\nvia DRM\nThe second setting is needed to skip through some proprietary files likewmv. As far as I have tested, vlc is now working as before without the nvidia graphics card. \n\nA: Update 19th October 2016\nI noticed that my Nvidia module was recompiled during an update today, so I rebooted and tested this again. It looks like the issue has now been fixed. For reference, I am running the driver version 367.57 on an Nvidia GTX 970.\n\nOriginal Answer\nTL;DR\nsudo apt-get purge nvidia-* -y\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:graphics-drivers/ppa\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade -y\n\nThe critical point here is that installing the drivers PPA results in \nthe libcuda1-361 libxnvctrl0 packages being upgraded which resolves the issue. I also found that I had issues with lots of the nvidia drivers so the safest thing to do is go back to the opensource driver. I have had some success with the nvidia-340 driver though.\nFull Description\nOk somehow I managed to resolve the situation by accident\nFirstly I installed the drivers ppa:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:graphics-drivers/ppa\n\nThen I purged the existing nvida drivers\nsudo apt-get purge nvidia-*\n\n\nThen I installed the 364 drivers.\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-364 -y\n\nAfter rebooting, I was unable to log into Ubuntu desktop but could log into Xubuntu desktop from previous testing. This would work long enough for me to see that the video playback worked perfectly, but within a few minutes my computer would lock up and would require hard rebooting. After doing this a few times I purged the nvidia drivers again:\nsudo apt-get purge nvidia-*\n\nI no longer have the nvidia binary drivers installed and am on the Nouveau driver but the video playback is working and my computer doesn't lock up!\n\nA: I was able to get mine working with nvidia-367 and nvidia-370 drivers by selecting the VLC Settings > Video > Output as \"X11 video output (XCB)\" instead of \"VDPAU output\" which had the lag when skipping. All the (XCB) options worked for me with nvidia-367 including \"X11 video output (XCB)\" -(didn't work on nvidia-370) and \"OpenGL GLX video output (XCB)\" -(OpenGL GLX worked after reboot after upgrading to nvidia-370). \n\nBasically all the XCB options worked well (skipping, speeds), Color ASCII art worked as normal, the OpenGL (non GLX/XCB) ones aligned to the bottom left but skipped well. ASCII art (black and white) worked OK but couldn't be resized. The others didn't display stuff to screen. \nWill think about updating to nvidia-370 as it just came out recently. \n\nA: Have the same problem with VLC in Unity 14.04, it started very recently, probably caused by regular apt upgrades, but I didn't pinpoint it. Choppy playback in VLC, vertical sync issues, video hangs for a few seconds while skipping ahead. I have an Nvidia card in my Dell laptop. I checked other options like the HDMI cable (using an external monitor), but eventually narrowed it down to VLC.\nMy (lazy) solution is switching to built in Totem player called \"Videos\" in Unity. It seems to have all the codecs and the basic features. No problems right now. I'll deal with this later or wait for updates.\n\nA: Had the same issue on Lenovo notebook with discrete nvidia video card and Ubuntu 16.04. Solved by choosing integrated Intel HD in nvidia-settings tool.\nSo the solution (if you have nvidia drivers installed) is to run nvidia-settings and choose integrated Intel HD video card\n\nA: I have had the same problem on a Debian Jessie, Nvidia 950 GC with backports Nvidia drivers, and VLC 2.2.4. The update to 367.44-3 version of the nvidia drivers switched the problem.\nThe solution I found : switching material decoding to \"VA-API via DRM\". It now works fine.\nHope this can help someone.\n", "Q: PPTP connects fine but fails shortly thereafter I'm using 16.04 LTS amd64.

This is incomplete installation, trying to use the module you get \nImportError: No module named matplotlib.pyplot\n\nProposal in comment. I run sudo apt-get install libfreetype6-dev libpng12-dev successfully. I run successfully sudo -H pip install matplotlib. However, I get the warning when running matplotlib module now\n/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/matplotlib/font_manager.py:273: UserWarning: Matplotlib is building the font cache using fc-list.

This may take a moment.')\n\n\nHow can you install matplotlib in Ubuntu 14.04?\n\nA: Edwinksl's comment and thread. The last warning is the font cache warning. Start ipython to find out Matplotlib's cache directory\nIn [2]: import matplotlib\nIn [3]: matplotlib.get_cachedir()\nOut[3]: u'/home/masi/.cache/matplotlib'\n\nIn my case, delete \nrm /home/masi/.cache/matplotlib/fontList.cache \nrm -r /home/masi/.cache/matplotlib/tex.cache/\n\nNow, run your matplotlib test code again. I got the same error again with the first run. I run the test code second time, and the case was resolved. Edwinksl's proposal why it has the behaviour\n\nI am guessing that the first iteration is indeed building the caches since they don't exist. On the second iteration, matplotlib knows the caches exist, so it doesn't bother building them again. \n\n", "Q: Cisco Switch Minicom, putty, picocom doesn't work I'm using Ubuntu 12.04 and I'm connected with a Cisco switch Catalyst 2950 through a Serial(RS232) to USB console cable.

It was working perfectly. When I turned on the PC Grub would show up with Ubuntu and Windows 10 as options, both worked perfectly. \nAfter messing around with Ubuntu l decided to reinstall it, so l downloaded Ubuntu 16.04, made a bootable USB and installed it over Ubuntu 15.04. \nThe problem is, now that I have Ubuntu 16.04 Grub won't load Windows 10, instead it displays an error as shown below.\nWindows Boot Manager  \nWindows failed to start. A recent hardware or software change might be the cause.  \nTo fix the problem:\n\n  1. Insert your Windows installation disc and restart your computer. \n  2. Choose your language settings, and then click \"Next.\"\n  3. Click \"repair your computer.\"\n\nIf you don't have this disc, contact your system administrator or computer\nmanufacturer for assistance. \n\n  File: \\Boot\\BCD  \n\n  Status: 0xc000000a  \n\n  Info: The Boot Configuration Data for your PC is missing or contains errors.\nThe curious thing is, I CAN boot Windows if I change from Legacy to UEFI or by pressing F12 (boot manager) and choosing Windows from the options.\nIt used to work fine and I don't know how I messed up.\n\nA: If you reinstall Ubuntu 16.04 as UEFI then it should sort it out. \nI was used to legacy boot but finally gave UEFI a try with a newish laptop. It works fine but what I didn't realise initially, when I was trying to install Ubuntu from a USB stick, is that I had to press f12 on booting up (to offer me the 'one-time boot menu') and then select the stick under the UEFI options.\n\nIf I didn't do that then it just read the stick as a legacy boot stick and, if I proceeded to install it in the usual manner, then Ubuntu and the grub bootloader would be installed in 'legacy' mode.\nSince Ubuntu and grub are then following the Legacy Boot rules, they don't have 'permission' to boot up a UEFI Windows partition and so you get the error.\nIf Ubuntu is installed in UEFI mode, then grub will be able to boot a UEFI Windows partition without any problems. \nYour grub boot menu (apart from the 'extra' Ubuntu 14.04 that I've installed) will probably then look something like this:\n\n", "Q: Can this plugin gstreamer1.0-libav be used in india? While playing a video on default player in Ubuntu, I got a error message saying that it needs to install an extra plugin gstreamer1.0-libav.  There is a warning besides it saying that the plugin is restricted in some countries. Can this be used in India?\n\n\nA: There is no technical problem here, but a legal one. Some countries have illiberal laws called “Digital restrictive management” and software patents, if you country has these laws then it is probably illegal for you to use this software.\nTherefore you question is a legal one. You need to find out about local laws.\n", "Q: How to increase the size of window buttons on Ubuntu? I have found settings to only increase the launcher size.

I have done tests on my RAM and on my SDD but nothing seems to be untoward to me. I am sorry for such an open ended question but I am desperate to solve this issue ASAP.\nEDIT:\nReplaced the 2010 sandisk SSD and hasn't happened since. Moral of the story - don't buy old SSDs on eBay :)\n\nA: You can try to force a check of all file systems skipping mounted ones with the -M option\n sudo fsck -Af -M \n\nIf it fails perhaps you can try for ext4 filesystems\n sudo fsck.ext4 -f /dev/sda1 > fsck-output.txt\n\nYou can change to ext3 depending on your filesystem type. \nThe Recommended filesystem for Linux systems would be EXT4 with TRIM intended to improve performance through reduced write cycles to the SSD drive given the limited write-rewrite cycles.\nCheck for output in the fsck-output.txt file for any errors or use dmesg to get any errors not printed on screen and let me know how it goes.\nRegards Douglas and hope it works out.\n\nA: Since this error started with the new SSD, I'd recommend checking the connection. If the disk is connected via SATA, that means both ends of the cable: Unplug and plug in again.\nIf the problem does not disappear, I'd recommend checking the SSD itself with whatever you have available. There might be some low-level tools from the manufacturer, there might be some data in the SMART logs.\n", "Q: How to Prevent Conflict between BTsync and IPython-notebook? System: Ubuntu 14.04, IPython 2. \nBoth opens the connection to 127.0.0.1:8888 which causes a lot of problems. If such a conflict happen, BTsync create a second instance of its files. This causes duplicate files and directories. \nThis thread has been forwarded to the developers of BTsync, since their program did not check the existence of the connection. Their program also create falsely duplicates complicating the three. I think this is a bug in BTsync.  \n\nHow can you Prevent Conflict between BTsync and IPython-Notebook?\n\nA: Answer from support of BTsync\nSync has ability to configurate network settings such as port using configuration file. You can find more info regarding it here:\n\nhttp://help.getsync.com/hc/en-us/articles/204762689\n\nThe option you are looking for is located in webui section\n\"listen\" : <IP: port>\nFor example, 0.0.0.0:4444 will listen to any interface on the LAN at port 4444.\n\nSo specify the port to something specific to avoid collisions. \n", "Q: Too many Primary partitions (MBR) after installing Ubuntu I am using a Sony (sve15118fnb) laptop. Recently I installed windows 10 and decided to dual boot it with Ubuntu. The disk uses MBR partition table, so the maximum number of primary partitions allowed is 4.\nThe disk partitions before installing Ubuntu, the red boundary indicates what was a logical partition before installing Ubuntu:\n\nThis makes 3-primary and 1-logical partition. But while installing Ubuntu, I went with the default (primary) as the partition type for swap and root directories. And after installing Ubuntu, the disk management shows partitions like this after installing Ubuntu\n\nThis makes 5-primary!! and 1-logical partition. How is this possible?\nPS: While installing Ubuntu, I didn't get any error/warning about the max number of primary partitions allowed. But every time before booting into Ubuntu this message shows up and only shows when booting to Ubuntu and not while booting to Windows:\n\n\nA: These non-named partitions on Windows 10 device management are created from Linux Ubuntu and not created from Windows because there are the partitions that would not show up in Computer but you will see it on Device Management and you are unable to access these drives, so you might get the partitions beyond the limit.\n", "Q: dd command clones 10MB and stops I am trying to clone old windows 8 HDD disk to new SSD.

I ask this again, because the question is special case and not handled in the answers for the related question. I upgraded from 15.10 to 16.04 using an installation media. Kernels from 15.10 are there at /boot, but the package management system seems to be unaware of this after upgrade. Related bug report is here. I do not know, if this happens, if you choose to upgrade in Software Updater.\n\nA: If the kernels are not known to dpkg, you can remove them by hand by deleting all their files (I do this to remove locally compiled kernels: How can I remove compiled kernel?)\nFirst check which kernel is running with uname -r\nDO NOT DELETE THE RUNNING KERNEL\nLet's say you want to delete kernel release 3.19.0-56 from your system.\nYou can use the release string to locate all of its files and directories. locate -b -e 3.19.0-56 will find existing (-e) files & directories with the string 3.19.0-56 without listing all the files in all the directories (-b)\nHaving located them, you can append the command to remove them rm -r with xargs. Let's use the -p flag to make xargs interactive, so that we can see the targets and confirm before the command is executed. Here's the whole command:\nlocate -b -e 3.19.0-56 | xargs -p sudo rm -r\n\nThen type y to really execute rm -r on the targets shown\n(this throws some errors complaining that everything that is not a directory does not exist because you're attempting to delete it recursively with -r, but it still works and the files are really gone - check again with sudo updatedb && locate -b -e 3.19.0-56 and nothing will be found)\nFinally, to clean the boot menu, run\nsudo update-grub\n\n", "Q: Think pad led is blinking after wake After installing Ubuntu 16.04 I get the next problem on my ThinkPad E440:\n1) My laptop connected to power\n2) I suspend it.\n3) After wake up - the led indicator on the top of letter \"i\" starts blinking for ever.\nIf I wake up my laptop when it is not connected to the power, led is stops after 2 - 4 blinks.\nIf I reboot my laptop it stops blinking.\nI have windows installation alongside, and everything is ok there.

If I close prompt instead of filling in a password and look into a gui option of editing network connection, there is password missing and is missing in /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/my-connection too.

The OpenGL 2.1 is supposed to be removed in near future, superseded by \"glcore\", which handles features provided by modern OpenGL versions, like tessellation and compute shaders, thus the deprecated in the name. For now glcore has some serious issues so the editor is fixed to the legacy, but battle tested renderer.\n  So no worries, it doesn't mean there's anything bad with your GPU or driver.\n\nUpdate:\nSince version 5.5.0b1, Unity now uses the OpenGL core rendering backend. This means that your development environment must support OpenGL core profile 3.2 or later.\n\nA: unity3d does not support OpenGL 4, only OpenGL 3.0+. The warning is telling you that you're running an old version of OpenGL that is deprecated, and you should update your drivers.\n", "Q: Epson Acculaser c1100 installed but not printing on ubuntu 15.10 Although when sending data to printer the data led on the printer is blinking nothing is printed finally.\nAny idea?\nThank u.\n\nA: I found a solution that worked on 15.10 also in this page here.\n", "Q: pkg-config not finding gtk+-3.0 States here that the package gtk+-3.0 was not found:\nkarl@karl-ux303ln:~$ pkg-config --cflags gtk+-3.0\nPackage gtk+-3.0 was not found in the pkg-config search path.\nPerhaps you should add the directory containing `gtk+-3.0.pc'\nto the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable\nNo package 'gtk+-3.0' found\n\nHowever I apparantly have gtk3 installed:\nkarl@karl-ux303ln:~$ dpkg -l libgtk* | grep -e '^i' | grep -e 'libgtk-*[0-9]'\nii  libgtk-3-0:amd64                            3.14.15-0ubuntu1~14.04~ricotz1                              amd64        GTK+ graphical user interface library\nii  libgtk-3-bin                                3.14.15-0ubuntu1~14.04~ricotz1                              amd64        programs for the GTK+ graphical user interface library\nii  libgtk-3-common                             3.14.15-0ubuntu1~14.04~ricotz1                              all          common files for the GTK+ graphical user interface library\nii  libgtk2.0-0:amd64                           2.24.23-0ubuntu1.3                                          amd64        GTK+ graphical user interface library\nii  libgtk2.0-bin                               2.24.23-0ubuntu1.3                                          amd64        programs for the GTK+ graphical user interface library\nii  libgtk2.0-common                            2.24.23-0ubuntu1.3                                          all          common files for the GTK+ graphical user interface library\n\nHowever I can't seem to find the file gtk+-3.0.pc:\nkarl@karl-ux303ln:~$ sudo find / -name \"gtk+-3.0.pc\"\nkarl@karl-ux303ln:~$ \n\nAny ideas?

The bad luck is those comprehensive guides are revolving around ubuntu 14.04 and maas 1.7 (I'm not sure but definitely not maas 2.0) so as you know everything seems different from old version of maas from packages you need to install to maas gui and even commands. Ok let me cut it short here and get to my problem specifically.\nIn ubuntu server there's two network interfaces one connected to university network (since I'm going through all these as a uni project & I set it all up in uni lab) with static ip and access to internet, and the other one connected to a dedicated switch again static ip and both nics configured in /etc/network/interfaces :\n# The loopback network interface\nauto lo\niface lo inet loopback\n\n# The primary network interface\nauto enp3s0\niface enp3s0 inet static\naddress 172.16.63.100\nnetmask 255.255.192.0\ngateway 172.16.40.12\ndns-nameservers 10.1.1.100 4.2.2.4 172.16.0.159\n\nauto enp5s0\niface enp5s0 inet static\naddress 10.1.1.100\nnetmask 255.255.255.0\n\n# static route\nup route add -net 172.16.0.0/18 default gw 172.16.40.12 dev enp3s0\n\nIn the maas gui under network tab there's two fabric-0 and fabric-1 with network information of public interface and private interface respectively.\nThe gui for fabric-1:\n\nUnder DNS tab but unfortunately the public interface's ip is shown :\n\nI couldn't figure it out how to change it to private interface's ip.\nBy the way when I for the first time changed the setups in the BIOS of one of the nodes connected to switch to be pxe booted and restarted it, it presumably booted by network and received things from maas although through this process demonstrated some failing errors to connect to some addresses on the internet (I'm not sure why since it gets every thing from maas, doesn't it?) and finally the black page with:\nUbuntu 16.6 LTS ubuntu\n\nubuntu login:\n\nappeared on the pxe booted node which I'm totally baffled what to do with that since I expect it to shutdown automatically. Well it did not and still no sign of enlisting that node on maas gui (still a 0 beside Machines under node tab)\n\nA: Well first I must say all the credits must go to our friend \"bc2946088\" who gave the vital clue, thank you again dude.\nAs he said I ran the sudo dpkg-reconfigure maas-region-controller command and changed the auto detected ip to 10.1.1.100. I also on the local PC from which I ssh to the maas, ran the route -p ADD 10.1.1.0 MASK 255.255.255.0 172.16.63.100 command and rebooted. After these when I hit the power of the node it exactly did what was expected, receiving stuff from maas and also getting thing from archive and finally shutdown. And best of all maas gui showed the node as New. Then I commissioned it (needed to hit the power button of that node) and it went on working seamlessly and status became Ready.\none more question,\nNow under DNS tab there are two entries\nShould it look like that?\n", "Q: MAAS 2.0 add subnet When I try to add a subnet on MAAS 2.0 I have the following configuration:\n\n\n*\n\n*VLAN masstest/untagged    space masstest   \n\n*CIDR 10.20.0.3/16         name testadmin\n\n*Gateway IP 10.20.0.2      DNS 10.20.0.3\n\n\nWhen I submit it I get \"Extra data: line 1 column 6 (char 5)\".\nWhat is this trying to tell me?\n\nA: Are you adding an IP or a subnet?

What will happen to the OpenCL 2.0 capability of my graphics card if I upgrade my system?\n\nA: If you have another spare graphics card to run the X desktop, or you run in headless mode, you can try this solution: Experimental OpenCL driver for Ubuntu 16.04\nBasically, this is a OpenCL-only fglrx driver and it does not conflict with other graphics drivers.

An updater tried to install Windows 10 in the middle of the night and now when I start the laptop, I get the grub rescue prompt. I tried this solution but ls into any partition gives me unknown filesystem.\nI installed the boot-repair utility with a Live USB and ran a \"Recommended Repair\", which after a few minutes reported it had ran successfully but the grub prompt was there waiting for me when I restarted the laptop. Incidentally, most of the advanced options are grayed out. Here's the boot info summary. \nI then tried to repair/restore using the Live USB assuming sda1 to be the Linux partition but chroot gave me failed to run command ‘/bin/bash’: No such file or directory.

In order to restore Windows 10, I booted from an Ubuntu Live USB and ran:\nsudo apt-get install syslinux\nsudo dd if=/usr/lib/syslinux/mbr.bin of=/dev/sda\n\nWindows didn't register my Ubuntu ext4 within an extended partition with the swap space. This was resolved, again from the Live USB, with parted:\nsudo parted /dev/sda unit s print\nsudo parted\n(parted) unit s\n(parted) rescue\n\nInput start & end and see if it finds partition. If a new partition is discovered, install boot-repair and run \"Recommended Fix\" to reinstall grub.

You do not want syslinux putting its additional boot data in the Windows partition, but want syslinux just to boot & pass boot to Windows code in the partition boot sector.\nHow to restore the Ubuntu/XP/Vista/7/8/10 BIOS bootloader\n\nA: Try the boot repair disk.

How to reinstall window from Ubuntu Ubuntu killed Window partition\nHey guys, I have this trouble. At first my Lap has Ubuntu and Window. But the grub has crashed and the best way to save it was backup data and reinstall OS.\nI chose to install Window7 first, after that was Ubuntu. The mistake happened and i didn't recognize was The volume after shrinked for Ubuntu was LOGICAL. And when then I let Ubuntu chose the place to live automatically so it killed my former Window ~cry~\nAnyone have some info about how to gparted this Volume and re-install Window7 from Ubuntu OS ? Give me some instruction or links as possible.\n\n\nA: Ok, if that image represents your PC's true situation, then your installed Windows is pretty much gone for good. Irrecoverable. Because you reformatted that partition from ntfs to ext and did overwrite the allocated space with your Ubuntu. \nNext i will present the easiest solution i could use and i do use to dual-boot Win+Ubuntu for more than 5 years now. It doesn't necessary means it's the best one, it's just the one than makes most sense to me. Other people may find other/better solutions.  \nFirst i boot a Live Ubuntu and sanitize my hard disk: in GParted i erase all partitions, all of it. Just empty space. Then i decide if a want BIOS-MBR partitioning or a UEFI-GPT one. It's actually a matter of motherboard capability, it's either BIOS or UEFI (UEFI is more modern solution).  \nI create a new partition table (MBR or GPT) in GParted, but i create no partition (yet). I reboot, i remove the Live Ubuntu medium and insert the Windows installation medium. I let Windows install itself the way it wants (with system, recovery and main partitions, whatever).\nWhen Windows installation has finished, i reboot , i remove the Windows installation medium and insert the Live Ubuntu back again. I boot into Live Ubuntu again, open GParted and create one ext partition after the Windows partition. I DO NOT delete or merge any of the partitions created by Windows.  \nAt this point i have 3 primary Windows partitions + one Ubuntu primary partition. This is possible even for older BIOS computers. Next, for BIOS-MBR PCs i create an extended partition and create a swap partition inside the extended space. UEFI-GPT supports 6 primaries easily, so no need for the extended trick.\nI apply changes in GParted, then i click the install Ubuntu icon. I choose the \"install Ubuntu alongside Windows\" option. When asked where i want Ubuntu installed i point to the ext partition. I choose to install GRUB to /sda, meaning the root of the harddisk, not to a specific partition like /sda1, /sda2, etc.  \nAfter the installation finishes, i reboot, i remove the Live Ubuntu medium, and the GRUB menu should present itself asking me to choose what OS to start: Ubuntu or Windows. That's all! Easy-Peasy dual-booting for newbies.\n", "Q: Mount count is not reset after automatic fsck run at boot There's a PC running Xubuntu 15.10 (wily). The system is configured to run fsck on a partition when said partition is mounted 20 times. After that, the expected behaviour is that the mount count should reset, but it doesn't. This means that, as the mount count keeps growing past 20, fsck runs automatically every time the PC boots.\ntune2fs shows that the filesystem state is clean and smartctl doesn't show any problem.\nWork-arounds used so far:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use tune2fs -C to reset the mount count manually\n\n*Boot from a Live CD and run fsck on the partition; this seems to reset the mount count properly when it finishes\n\n\nWhen the mount count reaches 20 next time, the issue appears again: mount count is not reset after the automatic fsck run.\nI have searched on this site and other places but haven't found any pointers as to what may be causing the issue. Any ideas?\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: After a bit of investigation, I found that the problem was in the systemd-fsckd service, from the systemd package. At the time of writing, the versions which are available in wily and xenial seem to contain the offending code (225-1ubuntu9 and 229-4ubuntu4 respectively).\nSolution\nAs the service is not necessary for the correct working of the system, a straightforward solution is just disabling it by running this command:\nsystemctl mask systemd-fsckd.service systemd-fsckd.socket\nThe downside is that now Plymouth won't report fsck progress. In fact, it won't even tell the user that a filesystem check is under way.\nExplanation\nA bit of background from the man page of the service:\n\nsystemd-fsckd.service is a service responsible for receiving file system check progress, and communicating some consolidated data to console and plymouth (if running). It also handles possible check cancellations.\nsystemd-fsckd receives messages about file system check progress from fsck through an UNIX domain socket [...]\n\nThe issue with this service is that it uses a hardcoded timeout of 30 seconds while doing an epoll_wait on the socket for progress information. If fsck doesn't report progress in less than 30 seconds, then systemd-fsckd closes the socket and exits with success without logging anything as far as I could see.\nThe next time that fsck writes in the (now closed) socket to report progress, it dies with a SIGPIPE. As fsck never finishes, the mount count is not reset then.\n", "Q: Deluge starts web gui on \"127.0.0.1\" interface instead so can not access if from another machine?

view at https://127.0.0.1:8112\n\n\nA: Looking at server.py file in \"web\" folder of deluge code, there is this:\n672     def start_normal(self):\n673         self.socket = reactor.listenTCP(self.port, self.site)\n674         log.info(\"serving on %s:%s view at http://127.0.0.1:%s\", \"0.0.0.0\",\n675             self.port, self.port)\n676\n677     def

So we should pay no attention to this line in the log file. Starting deluge on interface 0.0.0.0 actually makes it availiable to outside computers as well.\nIn my case the deluge-web was starting properly, the real issue was misconfigured ssl certificates.\n", "Q: How do I get my script to run BEFORE any shutdown sequence like unmounting my external drive I have a back up script in ~/scripts/backup.sh and my upstart conf in ~/.config/upstart/shutdown.conf.\ndescription \"my shutdown script\"\nstart on desktop-end\n\ntask\nconsole log\nscript\n  exec ~/scripts/backup.sh start\nend script\n\nMy script backs up to an external hard drive on desktop-end but the external hard drive gets unmounted before my script is called.\nHow can I precede the shutdown sequence with my script and then resume only when my script is done?\nI tried the solution from this post but the hook on starting rc isn't working.  \nThanks.\n\nA: Credit to this posted answer\nFirst, I don't know why upstart works at all since Ubuntu 15.10 should be using systemd instead.  So I used systemd to solve my problem.\nI create a systemd \"unit\" called backup.service\n[Unit]\nDescription=Backup script\nDefaultDependencies=no\nRequiresMountsFor=/mnt/D21EF5DA1EF5B795 /home /media/external\nBefore=shutdown.target reboot.target halt.target\n\n\n[Service]\nExecStart=/bin/bash /home/deanresin/scripts/backup.sh start\nType=oneshot\n\n[Install]\nWantedBy=multi-user.target\n\nRequiresMountsFor ensures those hard drives remain mounted before and during the script.  Before=shutdown.target reboot.target halt.target is the hook that will call the backup script.\nPut the backup.service file in /etc/systemd/system and sudo chmod u+x /etc/systemd/system/backup.service to make it executable.\nNow enable the backup.service by systemctl enable backup.service\nAnd voila!  The backup script \"backup.sh\" should be called at restart,shutdown or halt and executed before the specified drives are unmounted.\n", "Q: Keyboard problems, keys messed up Few minutes ago my keyboard messed up, when i press one key two symbols appear\nfor example when i press g it comes out as bg\nwhen pressing enter it printscreens\nany idea how to bring it to normal?\n\nA: First, go to Control Options and check out the physical keyboard type from the list: qwerty, dvorak, 102 keys, 105 keys, etc. Choose the most appropriate model.\nOpen an 'on-screen keyboard' app (e.g. florence) and see how your real keys are really mapped. Most probably you switched your keyboard language by mistake and ended up with some non-standard layout for another language. Switch it back to default en (or whatever you've been using before) by clicking on language icon on the taskbar.\n", "Q: I can't boot my ubuntu usb on my laptop I have an Asus laptop with Windows 8.1 installed. \nI created a bootable Ubuntu stick, deactivated secure boot and fast boot, created a booting destination of the USB port, and chose to boot from there but it just keeps opening Windows. What else should I try? Thanks!\n\nA: In windows start menu go to Settings -> Power Options -> Change what the power buttons do -> scroll down to the Shutdown settings now turn fast boot OFF , this is similar to a hibernation, do a shutdown, power back on enter BIOS setup, check settings, save & exit, then be ready to hit whatever key brings up the boot menu, could be F12, F9, then you should see your USB stick, if not you may have to go back to the bios and set the boot to legacy mode.\n", "Q: How to change the default save location for Firefox bookmarks?

I have a bash script which goes something like this:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nif [ $1 = \"--test\" ] || [ $1 = \"-t\" ]; then\n    echo \"Testing...\"\n    testing=\"y\"\n\nelse\n    testing=\"n\"\n    echo \"Not testing.\"\n\nfi\n\nSo what I want to be able to do is not only run it with ./script --test or ./script -t, but also with no arguments (just ./script), but seemingly if I do that with the current code the output is just:\n./script: line 3: [: =: unary operator expected\n./script: line 3: [: =: unary operator expected\nNot testing.\n\nSo how do I program it so that running it with no arguments at all will just do the else without throwing the error? What am I doing wrong?\n\nA: You need to quote your variables inside the if condition. Replace:  \nif [ $1 = \"--test\" ] || [ $1 = \"-t\" ]; then\n\nwith:  \nif [ \"$1\" = '--test' ] || [ \"$1\" = '-t' ]; then  \n\nThen it will work:  \n\n➜  ~ ./test.sh\n  Not testing.\n\nAlways always double quote your variables!\n\nA: You're using bash. Bash has a great alternative to [: [[. With [[, you don't have to worry whether about quoting, and you get a lot more operators than [, including proper support for ||:\nif [[ $1 = \"--test\" || $1 = \"-t\" ]]\nthen\n    echo \"Testing...\"\n    testing=\"y\"\nelse\n    testing=\"n\"\n    echo \"Not testing.\"\nfi\n\nOr you can use regular expressions:\nif [[ $1 =~ ^(--test|-t) ]]\nthen\n    echo \"Testing...\"\n    testing=\"y\"\nelse\n    testing=\"n\"\n    echo \"Not testing.\"\nfi\n\nOf course, proper quoting should always be done, but there's no reason to stick with [ when using bash.\n\nA: To test if arguments are present (in general, and do the actions accordingly) This should work:\n#!/bin/bash\n\ncheck=$1\n\nif [ -z \"$check\" ]; then\n  echo \"no arguments\"\nelse echo \"there was an argument\"\nfi\n\n\nA: Several ways; the two most obvious are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Put $1 in double quotes: if [ \"$1\" = \"--test\" ]\n\n*Check for number of arguments using $#\n\n\nBetter yet, use getopts.  \n\nA: The \"proper way\" of using long options in shell scripting is via getopt GNU utility. There's also getopts that is a bash built-in, but it only allows short options like -t.  A few examples of getopt usage can be found here.\nHere's a script that demonstrates how I'd approach your question. Explanation of most steps are added as comments within the script itself.\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# GNU getopt allows long options. Letters in -o correspond to\n# comma-separated list given in --long.\n\nopts=$(getopt -o t --long test -- \"$*\")\ntest $? -ne 0 && exit 2 # error happened\n\nset -- $opts # some would prefer using eval set -- \"$opts\"\n# if theres -- as first argument, the script is called without\n# option flags\nif [ \"$1\" = \"--\"  ]; then\n    echo \"Not testing\"\n    testing=\"n\"\n    # Here we exit, and avoid ever getting to argument parsing loop\n    # A more practical case would be to call a function here\n    # that performs for no options case\n    exit 1\nfi\n\n# Although this question asks only for one \n# option flag, the proper use of getopt is with while loop\n# That's why it's done so - to show proper form.\nwhile true; do\n    case \"$1\" in\n        # spaces are important in the case definition\n        -t | --test ) testing=\"y\"; echo \"Testing\" ;;\n    esac\n    # Loop will terminate if there's no more  \n    # positional parameters to shift\n    shift  || break\ndone\n\necho \"Out of loop\"\n\nWith a few simplifications and removed comments, this can be condensed to:\n#!/bin/bash\nopts=$(getopt -o t --long test -- \"$*\")\ntest $? -ne 0 && exit 2 # error happened\nset -- $opts    \ncase \"$1\" in\n    -t | --test ) testing=\"y\"; echo \"Testing\";;\n    --) testing=\"n\"; echo \"Not testing\";;\nesac\n\n", "Q: Error in Synaptic Package Manager I use Ubuntu Studio 16.04 LTS and, today, when I used Synaptic Package Manager I got the following error:\n*W: El objetivo Sources (partner/source/Sources) está configurado varias veces en /etc/apt/sources.list:48 y /etc/apt/sources.list:93*\n*W: El objetivo Packages (partner/binary-amd64/Packages) está configurado varias veces en /etc/apt/sources.list:47 y /etc/apt/sources.list:92*\n*W: El objetivo Packages (partner/binary-i386/Packages) está configurado varias veces en /etc/apt/sources.list:47 y /etc/apt/sources.list:92*\n*W: El objetivo Packages (partner/binary-all/Packages) está configurado varias veces en /etc/apt/sources.list:47 y /etc/apt/sources.list:92*\nW*: El objetivo Translations (partner/i18n/Translation-es_ES) está configurado varias veces en /etc/apt/sources.list:47 y /etc/apt/sources.list:92*\n*W: El objetivo Translations (partner/i18n/Translation-es) está configurado varias veces en /etc/apt/sources.list:47 y /etc/apt/sources.list:92*\n*W: El objetivo Translations (partner/i18n/Translation-en_US) está configurado varias veces en /etc/apt/sources.list:47 y /etc/apt/sources.list:92*\n*W: El objetivo Translations (partner/i18n/Translation-en_GB) está configurado varias veces en /etc/apt/sources.list:47 y /etc/apt/sources.list:92*\n*W: El objetivo Translations (partner/i18n/Translation-en) está configurado varias veces en /etc/apt/sources.list:47 y /etc/apt/sources.list:92*\n*W: El objetivo DEP-11 (partner/dep11/Components-amd64.yml) está configurado varias veces en /etc/apt/sources.list:47 y /etc/apt/sources.list:92*\n*W: El objetivo DEP-11-icons (partner/dep11/icons-64x64.tar) está configurado varias veces en /etc/apt/sources.list:47 y /etc/apt/sources.list:92*\n*W: No se podrán ignorar los privilegios para descargar mientras no se pueda acceder a «/root/.synaptic/tmp//tmp_sh» con el usuario «_apt». - pkgAcquire::Run (13: Permiso denegado)*\n\nHow can I fix it?\nRough translation of the errors:\nThe objective Sources/Packages/etc. (file1) is configured several times in file2 and file3\n\nDownload privileges could not be ignored while \"/path/to/file\" could not be accessed by user \"_apt\" -pkgAcquire::Run (13: Access denied)\n\n\nA: Select another location in updates and run:\nsudo apt-get update\n\n", "Q: The Eclipse executable launcher was unable to locate its companion shared library Upgraded from 14.04 LTS to 16.04 LTS but my Eclipse is not getting launched from the launcher on the side vertical bar.\nGiving me this error:\nThe Eclipse executable launcher was unable to locate its  companion shared library.\n\nReinstalling is not fixing the issue.\nWas referring to this thread but it seems there is not some easy way to get the launcher(the correct version of launcher) to get this issue fixed.\nMoreover if i follow this link also why the same launcher is able to invoke eclipse when we do this from command line Vs ICON?\nI am having Oracle JDK8 and using the installer to install Eclipse for Java EE Developers.\nThis is how my eclipse install directory looks like\nroot@ashu-700-430qe:/opt/eclipse/jee-mars/eclipse# ls -lrt\ntotal 236\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root 140566 Feb 12 16:55 icon.xpm\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root  79058 Feb 12 16:55 eclipse\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 root root   4096 May 29 11:44 readme\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 root root   4096 May 29 11:44 dropins\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root    798 May 29 11:44 eclipse.ini\ndrwxr-xr-x 11 root root   4096 May 29 12:37 configuration\n\nThis is how my eclipse.ini looks like for the launcher\n-startup\n../../../../root/.p2/pool/plugins/org.eclipse.equinox.launcher_1.3.100.v20150511-1540.jar\n--launcher.library\n../../../../root/.p2/pool/plugins/org.eclipse.equinox.launcher.gtk.linux.x86_64_1.1.300.v20150602-1417\n-product\norg.eclipse.epp.package.jee.product\n--launcher.defaultAction\nopenFile\n-showsplash\norg.eclipse.platform\n--launcher.XXMaxPermSize\n256m\n--launcher.defaultAction\nopenFile\n--launcher.appendVmargs\n-install\n/opt/eclipse/jee-mars/eclipse\n-vm\n/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-oracle/jre/bin\n-vmargs\n-Dosgi.requiredJavaVersion=1.7\n-XX:MaxPermSize=256m\n-Xms256m\n-Xmx1024m\n-Declipse.p2.max.threads=10\n-Doomph.update.url=http://download.eclipse.org/oomph/updates/milestone/latest\n-Doomph.redirection.index.redirection=index:/->http://git.eclipse.org/c/oomph/org.eclipse.oomph.git/plain/setups/\n\nand this is how the eclipse.desktop looks like\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=Eclipse\nType=Application\nExec=/opt/eclipse/jee-mars/eclipse/eclipse\nTerminal=false\nIcon=/opt/eclipse/jee-mars/eclipse/icon.xpm\nComment=Integrated Development Environment\nNoDisplay=false\nCategories=Development;IDE;\nName[en]=Eclipse\nX-Desktop-File-Install-Version=0.22\n\nPlease help.\n\nA: It's a permissions issue.

Yes, Category=Development ends into programming, Category=Programming end in Other :) \n[Desktop Entry]\nType=Application\nComment=Eclipse is an IDE for C, C++ and Java development\nName=Eclipse 2019-03\nExec=/usr/local/eclipse/eclipse\nIcon=/usr/local/eclipse/icon.xpm\nCategories=Development;\n\n\nA: As already suggested in the answer from splucena, you can edit the permissions of /root/.p2\nThat worked pretty well for me.\nWhat I would simply add is that you don't necessarily need to add read and execute permissions to everyone in that folder for this to work.\nYou can just add those permissions to your specific user, by using ACL (access-control list):\n# setfacl -R -m u:youruser:rx /root\n\nTo check ACL permissions were set properly:\n# getfacl /root\n\n\nA: Same problem with Eclipse 2022-03.\nAs other users have mentioned, the problem is about the .p2/ directory.\nWhen the installer is run as root, it puts that in the /root directory.\nYou might mess with permissions.\nIt is inappropriate for non-root users to be writing in the /root directory.\nThe .p2/ directory has to do with \"bundle pools\".\nThe way I read it, this technology is a bandage on other bandages, an attempt to mitigate file bloat problems caused by previous poor choices.  Don't know for sure.\nBut you can turn the .p2 stuff off in the installer.\nMenu --> Advanced Mode\n\"Bundle Pool\" is the path of the .p2/ directory.\nThe field is not editable. \nIt can be un-checked, though.  Proceed.\nEclipse Projects: you will probably need one of\nCDT C development toolkit\nJDT Java development toolkit\n\nIn last panel, set \"Root Install Folder\" to /opt,\n\"Installation folder name\" to eclipse.\nYou will have to \"trust\" some stuff, I guess.\nIn the last pane, un-check \"Launch automatically\".\nOtherwise, it launches eclipse as root, without so much as a by-your-leave.\nBut then, eclipse does run for normal users.\n(You have to install the desktop menu icons yourself, but it isn't hard.)\n", "Q: How to not show minimized windows in GNOMEs activities overview?

The machine has no desktop, only a command shell. It is running 12.04. I have been doing apt-get update & upgrade weekly for four years. How do I convert it to 16.04 from the command line? I have a 16.04 server install CD, do I boot from that?\n\nA: General\nYou can always upgrade from LTS to LTS, in your case that would mean:\n\n\n*\n\n*upgrade from 12.04 to 14.04 and then \n\n*upgrade from 14.04 to 16.04\n\n\nAs far as i know there is no supported upgrade from 12.04 to 16.04 directly.\nFollowing this approach there is no need for your 16.04 medium\nAs always, consider creating a backup of your critical files before you start.\nLimit to LTS\nThe way to limit upgrades to LTS without a GUI is to change the value of  Prompt in /etc/update-manager/release-upgrades.\nSet it to\n[DEFAULT] Prompt=lts\n\nThe possible values are\n\n\n*\n\n*never: Never check for a new release.\n\n*normal: Check to see if a new release is available. If more than one new release is found, the release upgrader will attempt to upgrade to the release that immediately succeeds the currently-running release.\n\n*lts: Check to see if a new LTS release is available. The upgrader will attempt to upgrade to the first LTS release available after the currently-running one. Note that this option should not be used if the currently-running release is not itself an LTS release, since in that case the upgrader won't be able to determine if a newer release is available\nHow to upgrade\nFor both upgrade processes you should always update the current system via\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\n\nThen start the upgrade via\nsudo do-release-upgrade\n\nor - SPECIAL CASE - for development versions (which is valid for upgrades from 14.04 to 16.04 until 16.04.1 was released):\nsudo do-release-upgrade -d\n\nIf do-release-upgrade command is not found, install it:\nsudo apt-get install update-manager-core\n\n\nA: As far as I can tell, I must edit\n/etc/update-manager/release-upgrades\nto change Prompt to\n[DEFAULT] Prompt=lts\nThen reboot and give these commands:\nsudo bash\napt-get update\napt-get upgrade\n\n{Reboot again}\nsudo bash\ndo-release-upgrade -c\n\n{check target version}\ndo-release-upgrade\n\n{I can upgrade from 12.04 to 14.04 now;\nupgrading from 14.04 to 16.04 may have to wait until August}\n=========\nI asked a question about how to upgrade a server from 12.04 to 16.04. I got many leads, links to other sites, etc. Finally, I posted my own answer - the specific commands I must give to do it. My posted answer was gleaned from reading all the other answers.\nEvery answer has a rating. I assume higher numbers are better. I see that my summary answer has a rating of minus one. I assume this is worse than zero. How did I earn a minus one rating?\n\nNote: all three of my computers already read  \"Prompt=lts\"\n\n", "Q: Made a huge mistake and deleted my /home/user folder (Ubuntu 14.04 LTS) I was following this question here: Nautilus Thumbnails Size Fix\nI screwed something up and I don't know how to fix it.\nI installed dconf-editor and changed the thumbnail size in nautilus. after that was done, I entered (or at least I thought I did):\nsudo rm -r ~/.cache/thumbnails/ \n\nNow it looks like my user settings are gone.\nMy bookmarks in chromium are gone, the downloads directory is empty, and I know there were some files in there with some TV show episodes in them.\nI looked in the system log and discovered that I typo'd the path as /home/zombie /.c.cache/thumbnails/ From the system auth.log\n May 28 15:55:54 Zombie-Dell sudo:   zombie : TTY=pts/4 ; PWD=/home/zombie ; USER=root ; COMMAND=/bin/rm -r /home/zombie /.c.cache/thumbnails/\n\n\nA: Stop using that Ubuntu installation\nFirst of all immediately stop using that Ubuntu installation. Now!\nYou should boot straight to a live DVD/USB. If you don't have one, do not download it from that system and go get it somewhere else. However, if you have a dual boot, you might also use Windows to download the ISO.\nTry to access the deleted files\nWhen you are using the live DVD, check the partitions with:\nsudo parted -l\n\nYou need to find the right one that contains your home directory. For example, my computer shows the following for drive /dev/sda:\nNumber  Start   End    Size   Type      File system  Flags\n 1      1049kB  256MB  255MB  primary   ext2         boot\n 2      257MB   250GB  250GB  extended\n 5      257MB   250GB  250GB  logical\n\nThis is not the best example because I am using full disk encryption, but assuming I wanted to restore files from /boot I would target /dev/sda1  (basically look at the number).\nAt this point, connect an external hard drive where you want to recover the files.\nNow you need to install a program called Testdisk:\nsudo apt install testdisk\n\nThen run it on your drive:\nsudo testdisk /dev/sda\n\nIt will display an interactive procedure that you need to follow through the textual interface. Basically you will arrive at a list of partitions and you need to select the right one with the arrow keys.\nThen you will need to press P to show the files and navigate in the directory tree. Once you have determined that hopefully your home directory contains the stuff (shown in red since it has been deleted), go one level up so that you highlight your username inside /home and press C to activate the Copy function.\nTestdisk will ask you where you want to save the files. Navigate to a directory in your external hard drive and confirm. Wait patiently while it restores your data in the external drive.\nBottom line\nUbuntu has a backup program installed by default. You should use it routinely, before something like this happens again.\n", "Q: How to view locally stored HTML files on Ubuntu Touch?

The first result you'll get when you type chrome on google, will send you to the page where you can download Chrome for Linux.\nGoogle will detect that you're looking for a Linux version and direct you there automatically but it will not detect your exact system.  Since you're using Ubuntu, the correct option is .deb.\nBe aware that only 64-bit chrome is supported and you can use it as long as a 64-bit Ubuntu is installed on your system.

I was going to ask a bit more detailed question but I won't. It's just ridiculous.\n\nA: You can see why in this article of the community wiki:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats\nThe introduction of the article gives the logic behind this decision:\n\nUbuntu strives to make all of the most important software available to its users automatically. However patent and copyright restrictions (see Ubuntu License Policy) complicate distribution of software to support non-free formats...\nUbuntu’s commitment to only include completely free software by default means that proprietary media formats are not configured “out of the box”.

A full will only be able to run on computers with the same hardware as the one you initially installed with. Although, once booted, both types of installation will run with the same speed.\nNote* I read that Live uses compressed files, is this true? and wouldn't this cause the Live to be slightly slower?\n2) Both Live and Full are able to obtain persistent settings, although, live boot requires additional work to create a separate partition to be used for persistent if wanting more than 4GB.\n3) Both installations do the same amount of ware onto your USB when reading and writing.\n4) You are unable to uninstall the pre-installed programs for Live but in Full, you have full control over the programs for which lay in the original image.\n5) Live is unable to update Ubuntu when updates are present. With Full, updates are naturally installed when available like a normal system.\n6) Both methods are equally as powerful. In other words, Live is NOT a smaller sample version of the actual Full.\nLike i said, please correct or address any misunderstandings i may have. Everything i learned has been reading on the web so i'm not sure what is completely true and what is not.\nWhat i would like about Ubuntu on my USB\n1) Unlimited amount of persistent settings (limited by the size of the drive obviously) is a must, but to my understanding this is achievable by both.\n2) Being able to update my Ubuntu when updates are released.\n3) Being able to boot from any and all computers, which from my understanding is not possible by Full.\n4) Being able to have full control of my Ubuntu, not a mini version or compressed file system.\n\nBy using a high memory flash drive with fast read and write speeds, i want to run Ubuntu off a USB on a variety of computers. If you can assist me in any way, i would greatly appreciate your help.

I tried this and it worked but i was unable to get the boot loader to be on the USB therefore i could only boot from my home computer. So if the answer is a Full install, please help me out with the partitions. Thanks in advance!\n\nA: Small comparison between your mentioned options :  \nLiveCD/LiveDVD < LiveUSB < LiveUSB with persistence < Full install on USB  ,  \nwhere < sign means less than , as in lesser productivity options.\nAs you already know Live systems are mainly intended as demos mediums, install mediums, and limited productivity mediums (as in rescue scenarios or restrictive, secure mediums).\nLive systems do use a special type of file system called squashfs, in which are squashed in all the files needed for the live system to run (including OS and software). Squashfs is a fixed, uneditable system.\nYou can update any live version, but the updates will be lost after reboot, unless you had set up persistence mode. You can install any software in any live version, but all the installs will be lost after reboot, unless you had set up persistence.\nFull install is not a great idea for USB, because USB drives are typically supporting about 1000 writing cycles, whereas an internal drive (even a ssd) is typically supporting much more writing cycles. More yet, in most situations, the SATA bus of an internal drive is much faster than an USB bus. Sure, SATA I is slower than USB 3.0, but that's the exception rather than the rule. And even so, the motherboard always presumes SATA is prioritary over USB, and therefore SATA will always be the preferred bus, and SATA data will always be executed first no matter the speed of the bus.  \nWhen you do a full install on USB, you can to run it on any system, as long as it has the same CPU architecture, same type of video card, same type of RAM, etc. You can't run an Ubuntu x86 on ARM architecture.\n", "Q: Stop apt-get autoremove from removing old kernel? I like managing kernels my self, and I can't figure how to stop apt-get autoremove from deleting older kernels.\n\nA: apt-get autoremove, removes files that have been installed automatically and are no longer needed.  If you want autoremove not to remove some of them, you can mark them as installed manually.  In your case:  sudo apt-mark manual package_name.\nIf you have installed a mainline kernel, you need to mark 3 packages:\nlinux-headers-version\nlinux-headers-version-generic\nlinux-image-version-generic\nIf you are using the official kernel, you need to mark one more package:\nlinux-image-extra-version-generic.\nThe only thing you have to do is find the correct version and replace the word in the package name.  Of course all three or four versions have to be the same.\n\nA: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RemoveOldKernels#GUI_Way explains how to mark a kernel as automatically installed. You can do the opposite. Here is an example command:\nFirst I run the command without super user rights:\napt-mark manual '^linux-.*-5\\.0\\.0-38(-generic)?$'\n\napt mark tells me:\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.0.0-38-generic can not be marked as it is not installed.\nlinux-image-5.0.0-38-generic set to manually installed.\nlinux-headers-5.0.0-38-generic can not be marked as it is not installed.\nlinux-modules-extra-5.0.0-38-generic set to manually installed.\nlinux-modules-5.0.0-38-generic set to manually installed.\nE: Could not create temporary file for /var/lib/apt/extended_states - mkstemp (13: Permission denied)\nE: Failed to write temporary StateFile /var/lib/apt/extended_states\n\nThis looks fine, therefore I run the command with sudo.\nIf you want to know what the '^linux-.*-5\\.0\\.0-38(-generic)?$' does visit https://regex101.com/r/Oi9ixx/1\n\nA: If you don't mind using a GUI, there are programs to manage this problem.  For years the go-to one was Ubuntu Tweak, but it recently became abandonware.  However, it's still available and functioning in the LTS versions of Ubuntu.  For information on how to install it in 16.04, see the answer to this question.\nUbuntu Tweak's Janitor function will list all the software than can be removed.  If you don't wish to remove the kernels, simply don't check the boxes by them, and use the program to remove everything else.\n", "Q: snapcraft snap failing because python modules are missing I'm attempting to learn something of snap desktop packaging by repackaging unity-tweak-tool as a snap.

But as I use desktop almost all the time and the connection to the Internet is the same, I run tor only on the desktop, but on the laptop I would like to disable it but not to uninstall Tor.\nI disabled it (at least I think so) with the help of the sysrv-conf utility. None of the runlevels is checked.\nBut when I restart the laptop I see Tor as running:\n$ps aux | grep tor\n........ /usr/lib/bin/tor ..........\n\nand the log file says that Tor performed some activity:\n$tail /var/log/tor/log\n...... Tor has successfully opened a circuit. Looks like client functionality is working.\n\nCould anyone explain to me, please, what happens? I thought that every program which starts and runs in background, without a user's help is considered a service/daemon and can be disabled. But this notion flies in the face of this situation, I think.\n\nA: What is happening here is that since Ubuntu 15.04 Ubuntu distros use systemd init-service instead of SysVinit or Upstart. So a service must be disabled with this command: \nsudo systemctl disable SERVICENAME.service\n\nIf one is confused with all this stuff: init-service, systemd, SysVinit, Upstart I can recommend to read Chapter 15 \"Starting and Stopping Services\" from the Linux Bible by Chris Negus\n", "Q: Joomla 3.0.3 installation gets stuck in the configuration section in Xubuntu 16.04 localhost Trying to setup joomla 3.0.3 on my localhost on Xubuntu 16.04 but the installation gets stuck in the configuration section.

The only drivers that I don't have are for the ambient light sensor and .\nThe touch screen itself is somewhat useful in the desktop environment. Unity has some multitouch gestures (e.g. for moving windows around) and some apps distinguish between touch and clicks while some do not. For example, in the file browser a touch will scroll while a click and drag will select. Chromium does this too, making for quite a nice browsing experience.\nThat being said, it doesn't perform well as a tablet, despite Canonical going on about \"convergence\" for so long. There are a few too many things that are a very difficult or impossible, without a mouse or a right click that it's not really worth removing the dock. The onscreen keyboard is a pain to set up properly (though is fine for actually typing).\nIt is probably possible to get the phone/tablet \"Ubuntu Touch\" software on there, but it's far less powerful than the desktop environment.\nSee this other question for another account.\n", "Q: Cannot resume from suspend ubuntu 16.04 Gnome I have laptop lenovo g40-45 with ubuntu 16.04 Gnome installed.\nThe problem is that after suspend, i just got blank screen and cannot do anything but force-shutdown from power button.\nI had ubuntu 14.04 unity installed before, it suspends and resumed perfectly.\nMy question: is it hardware problem or a gnome problem?\n\nA: From Ubuntu 16.04, Ubuntu and ATI have collaborated to develop new open source graphics drivers to replace fglrx which existed on 14.04.\nIt is not a hardware problem since you can perform suspend and resume operations perfectly.\nIt appears like a graphics driver problem.\nYou can file a bug report or wait till subsequent updates to the driver fixes this.\n\nA: It's related to both our BIOS and Kernel version.

This is probably best if you have a mix of different filesystems including btrfs.\nRawhide (rh) is available from https://raf.org/rawhide or https://github.com/raforg/rawhide.

My /usr/bin/vlc binary was broken after installing vlc from source into /usr/local prefix. Based on my experience installations into /usr/local didn't affect binaries /usr/bin/[binary], but maybe that was just by accident.\nAfaik the effect of a /usr/local installation might be (unstable) shared libraries which are loaded from there before the (stable) ones from /usr/. So, does Ubuntu force package maintainers to load dynamic libraries from /usr/ only?\nResources like hier manpage, BLSF position on /usr/local vs /usr and FHS explanation of Debian answers this question imo since it doesn't define interoperability between binaries in different prefixes.\nThis is not about the functioning of path lookup priorities (for binaries, shared libraries, ...) which is quite clear for me, but about their usage (constraints, definitions, (pseudo)-standards) in Ubuntu.\n\nA: \nBased on my experience installations into /usr/local didn't affect binaries /usr/bin/[binary], but maybe that was just by accident.\n\nYou should hang out around Ask Ubuntu more often. :)\nUsing sudo pip install, which installs to /usr/local, breaking various Python applications is IME by far the most common Python problem I have seen here. If you installed a PyPi package that already had a system package present, it could break whatever was using the system package. Just a few weeks ago I had apt-get-installed certbot break due to a pip-installed certbot plugin.\nPackages aren't supposed to officially install anything in /usr/local (exceptions like CA certificates, aside), since that is the system administrator's domain - but that's the only restriction. Clearly if the system administrator is to make full use of the power that /usr/local provides, then things elsewhere in /usr must be able to be affected them. It's not so much that they're \"allowed to be broken\" by source install; it's more that the system administrator is trusted to know what effects their installing things in /usr/local will have.\n", "Q: Emptying an Ubuntu 14.04 LTS Trash can Yes can't get the garbage out from my Ubuntu 14.04 LTS ( Ubuntu 12 had issues too! ). So (I login as a user who has sudo rights):\n1st try\nright click on Trash > Empty Trash ... > Empty Trash and this is what I get, without seeing my Trash getting empty: \n \n2nd try open Trash can > Empty --> same as above\n3rd try open Trash can > try to delete a single file inside and I get the following:\n\n4th try sudo nautilus > select Trash from Places -->\n\n5th try posted a question to ask ubuntu --> ? ( Thanks! )\n\nA: For some reason file managers give an error when you access trash icon with sudo (caja and thunar do that also). Also there is a chance that trash permissions has changed (never run file managers and gui applications in general with sudo, use gksu or pkexec instead) and maybe that's why you can't empty trash with no sudo rights. In order to be sure, delete the folder ~/.local/share/Trash and it will be recreated empty on reboot (if you are sure there's nothing wrong with permissions just delete specific files in ~/.local/share/Trash/files folder).\n", "Q: Upstart - Service immediately stops after starting Here's my /etc/init/jobname.conf file:\nstart on startup\nstop on shutdown\nrespawn\n\nscript\n    php /home/inersha/file.php\nend script\n\nWhen I start the service, it immediately stops:\n$ sudo service jobname start\njobname start/running, process 16703\n$ sudo service jobname status\njobname stop/waiting\n\nWhen I run php /home/inersha/file.php from the command line it works fine. Also, I have the exact same setup on my local computer and that works too... it just keeps stopping on my remote server.\nWhy is this happening?\n\nA: I checked /var/log/upstart/JOBNAME.log to see what was going on.\nTurns out I had a relative link in my file.php, like this:\n <?php\n include '../somethin.php'\n ?>\n\nI think this upstart executes this script as root /, so it's not able to follow the relative link. So I changed it to an absolute link and it works fine:\n <?php\n include '/home/inersha/folder/somethin.php'\n ?>\n\n\nA: Comparing to other SAPIs CLI SAPI does not change the current working directory to the one the started script resides in.\nA portable way would be to use the function realpath and constant __DIR__:\n<?php\nrequire_once realpath(__DIR__ .

I have created two directories called Cat and Dog. Under Cat I created a file called puppies.\nWhen I try to move puppies from Cat to Dog I get No such file or directory. However, when I go back and cd Cat and ls -a, it shows puppies. Then, I go back to my home directory and ls -a, and Cat and Dog are listed.\nSo what am I doing wrong?\n\nA: Some useful things to know when doing things with files:\n\n\n*\n\n*Linux is case sensitive (so dog, Dog and DOG are all different files)\n\n*How commands work depends on where you are in the filesystem\n\n*Based on where you are you can use relative or absolute pathnames\n\n\nSo, if you are in the parent directory of Cat and Dog you can use relative pathnames, like this:\nmv Cat/puppies Dog\n\nAn easy mistake to make is to type the pathname starting with /\nmv /Cat/puppies /Dog\n\nThis will give a no such file or directory error, because / is the root directory and there are no Cat and Dog directories under /. Have a look:\nls /\n\nOne reason for this confusion is that the system uses a helpful shortcut for the user's home directory, so instead of /home/username/somefile you can type ~/somefile as the absolute pathname of somefile in your user's home directory, so, assuming Cat and Dog are at the top of your user's home directory, you can move puppies from Cat to Dog from anywhere in your filesystem with\nmv ~/Cat/puppies ~/Dog\n\nA couple of examples using relative pathnames\nIf you are in the directory Cat, you can move puppies like this\nmv puppies ../Dog\n\n.. specifies the parent directory of the current working directory\nIf you are in the directory Dog you can move puppies like this\nmv ../Cat/puppies .\n\n. specifies the current working directory \nTo find out where you are, you can usually look at your prompt, but just to be sure, you can always check with pwd which stands for 'print working directory'\n\nA: The command I would use here is (assuming they are in the top level of your home directory):\nmv ~/Cat/puppies ~/Dog/puppies \n\nIf the directory puppies contains more directories you will need to add the recursive flag -r which would make the command look like:\nmv -r ~/Cat/puppies ~/Dog/puppies \n\nNote the command is case sensitive.\n", "Q: redmine 2.4 installation on 14.04 fails on bundle install I'm trying to set up redmine (locally) using kubuntu 14.04, and followed the instructions from redmine.org.

Please make sure that the NVIDIA Display Driver is properly installed and present in your system:\nPlease also try adding directory that contains libnvidia-ml.so to your system PATH.\n\nWhat I have so far learned through all my tries and researches since the release (short version, ask for detail any time):\nMy two Problems are related but not the same:\nNvidia-settings Empty:\n\n\n*\n\n*this is because these settings only show up, when there is an Xserver connected to the nvidia GPU\n\n*the solution for this would be to add a new screen in xorg.conf that forces and unused xserver to run on the nvidia GPU\n\n*but this is currently not possible (see other problem) and not desired, as I purely want the nvidia GPU to focus on Cuda\n\n\nNvidia-smi not working:\n\n\n*\n\n*bbswitch is not a problem as my GPU (550ti) does not support it (errors in dmesg)\n\n*nvidia prime changes the entry for x86_64-linux-gnu_gl_conf to either /usr/lib/nvidia-361/ld.so.conf (nvidia GPU selected) or /usr/lib/nvidia-361-prime/ld.so.conf (intel GPU selected)\n\n*the configuration for the intel selection is missing essential paths to the essential nvidia modules which are all present in the conf for nvidia selection\n\n*when switching to nvidia via prime-select, I don't have a Xserver as the Display is connected to the integrated GPU, but logging in at a virtual console nvidia-smi works\n\n\nMy Assumption:\n\n\n*\n\n*Nvidia prime is bad and does not want the way I want.\n\n*I have to somehow overcome prime and configure the system (even manually writing new configs?)\n\n\nMy Tries:\n\n\n*\n\n*I tried uninstalling nvidia-prime but I only recognised afterwards, that this cannot work. When the conf file for x86_64-linux-gnu_gl_conf is deleted, the outcome is a pure mess...\n\n*I even tried adding the missing paths to the x86_64-linux-gnu_gl_conf files manually, but I didn't really know what I was doing and had no success.\n\n\nMy Questions:\n1) How can I solve the nvidia-smi problem? Am I on the right track? Does anyone have instructions how I could proceed?\n2) Is it possible to enable fan control and further controls for the nvidia gpu (coolbits in xorg.conf) without an Xserver on the gpu (without a screen for the gpu in xorg.conf)?\nHuge thanks in advance for any replies. I literally combed the web, the comb being my problem.\nIf I missed anything important, please tell me and do not hesitate to request log files etc.\nTHANKS\nImages\nMy additional driver tab image:\n\n\nA: I (creator of this post) found the solution I need on my own!\nI will now explain the solution for anybody else who is in a similar situation and needs this help!\nSOLUTION:\nINSTALL THE NVIDIA DRIVER VIA THE RUNFILE PROVIDED AT http://www.nvidia.com/object/unix.html WITH THE FLAG \"--no-opengl-files\" !!\nThis prevents not only the nvidia opengl files from overwriting the existing mesa files but also installs the driver without nvidia prime!!\nSo all of my problems are solved, simply by installing the driver manually, instead of installing it from the repositories. The package from the repositories is \"Optimus-Friendly\" and therefore has all the useless troublemakers bundled with it.\nSECONDLY\nthe xorg.conf has to be extended with another screen for the dedicated GPU(s) so that it/they has/have entries in nvidia-settings.\nmine looks like this\nSection \"ServerLayout\"\n    Identifier     \"Layout0\"\n    Screen 0       \"intel\" 0 0\n    Screen 1       \"nvidia550ti\" 3000 0\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Device\"\n    Identifier     \"intel\"\n    Driver         \"intel\"\n    BusID          \"PCI:0@0:2:0\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Device\"\n    Identifier     \"nvidia550ti\"\n    Driver         \"nvidia\"\n    BoardName      \"GeForce GTX 550ti\"\n    BusID          \"PCI:2@0:0:0\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Screen\"\n    Identifier     \"intel\"\n    Device         \"intel\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Screen\"\n    Identifier     \"nvidia550ti\"\n    Device         \"nvidia550ti\"\n    Option         \"AllowEmptyInitialConfiguration\" \"on\"\n    Option         \"Coolbits\" \"4\"\n    Option         \"ConstrainCursor\" \"on\"\nEndSection\n\n\nA: I reinstalled the nvidia drivers without opengl as mentioned in the above solutions but it did not work for me. Moreover these solutions are quite unsatisfactory, since they imply removing some capability of the drivers (opengl).\nI found a much simpler solution, for which you do not need to reinstall the driver:\n\n\n*\n\n*I installed the nvidia drivers normally\n\n*In the nvidia-settings gui, untder PRIME profiles, I choose the intel graphic card as a main GPU\n\n*After rebooting, nvidia-smi does not work, but I fixed by adding /usr/lib/nvidia-387 to the libraries path:\nexport LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/nvidia-387:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH\nNote that depending on the driver installed, you might need to add another folder in your library path, for example /usr/lib/nvidia-384.\nYou can add this command to the file ~/.bashrc to automatically export the path when loading a new bash.\n\nA: The accepted answer uses the X server to enable the Nvidia devices. This is not necessary and means that the X server will use some memory of the card.\nInstead nvidia-modprobe should be installed as described in the driver FAQ (can be found at the link below).\nSo my recommended solution is to:\n1) Install the latest Nvidia driver via the runfile from ftp://download.nvidia.com/XFree86/Linux-x86_64/ with the --no-opengl-files and --dkms flag.\n2) Install the corresponding nvidia-modprobe version via make all and sudo make install from ftp://download.nvidia.com/XFree86/nvidia-modprobe/\nThe --dkms flag makes sure that the kernel module is recompiled when you upgrade your kernel.\n\nA: mainly as a reminder for me: \nin ubuntu 18.04 to use igpu for rendering and nvidia gpu for cuda, install default nvidia drivers, open nvidia-settings and set to use intel gpu.\nAfter that, blacklist nouveau drivers and part of the nvidia drivers:\nopen /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-nvidia.conf and comment lines in this way:\n#blacklist nvidia\nblacklist nvidia-drm\n#blacklist nvidia-modeset\n#alias nvidia off\nalias nvidia-drm off\n#alias nvidia-modeset off\n\nafter that open /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-nvidia-nouveau.conf and add those lines:\nblacklist nouveau\noptions nouveau modeset=0\n\nto be really sure nouveau are disabled, you can blacklist them in /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf too:\nat the end add:\n#Blacklist nouveau drivers\nblacklist nouveau\nblacklist lbm-nouveau\nalias nouveau off\nalias lbm-nouveau off\n\nthen reboot.\ntype nvidia-smi to check nvidia is loaded, and type lspci -nnk | grep -iA2 3D to check the driver in use is nvidia and not nouveau.\n\nA: I obtained the configuration that you want (I wanted it too ;) ):\n\n  \n*\n  \n*the intel GPU shall run the xserver and my monitor, which is connected to the onboard DP\n  \n*the nvidia GPU shall only be used for CUDA specific computation etc. \n  \n*full control over the nvidia gpu (real time, stats, temps fan speeds...)\n  \n\nby using bumblebee.\nBut before I go into some details, I should warn you that when changing the configuration of nvidia-settings or xorg.conf or nvidia prime, you have to reboot your system (maybe you already know). Not rebooting could leave the system in a non-consistent state.\n\nIn my configuration I didn't touch xorg.conf. Doing so for me it has always been source of pain. Please leave it to the original state. If you don't want to perform a fresh install, you can find some backups in /etc/X11/ (ls /etc/X11/xorg.conf*).\nThe first step is trying to make nvidia-settings work. If you succeed to do so, you can use nvidia PRIME to switch to the intel GPU, as you mention you already did. Having nvidia prime point to the intel GPU is needed if you want to use the NVIDIA GPU only for CUDA computations (it is especially needed if you want to use the cuda debugger cuda-gdb).\nAfter that you can try to install bumblebee:\nsudo apt install bumblebee\n\nReboot. You can monitor the state of bumblebee using\nsudo service bumblebeed status\n\nor\nbumblebeed -vv\n\nWhat bumblebee does is to activate the NVIDIA GPU and trying to insert the nvidia driver in the kernel only when required. You can use bumblebee by pre-pending optirun to the the command you want to run.\nTo make bumblebee work, I had to manually edit /etc/bumblebee/bumblebee.conf to correctly set the nvidia driver name and path.\n[...]\nDriver=nvidia\n[...]\nKernelDriver=nvidia_361\n[...]\nLibraryPath=/usr/lib/nvidia-361:/usr/lib32/nvidia-361\n\nThen, after a sudo service bumblebeed restart I managed to activate the bumblebee system.\nIn fact nvidia-smi returns\n$ nvidia-smi\nNVIDIA-SMI couldn't find libnvidia-ml.so library in your system. Please make sure that the NVIDIA Display Driver is properly installed and present in your system:\nPlease also try adding directory that contains libnvidia-ml.so to your system PATH.\n\nbut  optirun nvidia-smi:\n$ optirun nvidia-smi\nFri Jun 17 11:47:48 2016       \n+------------------------------------------------------+                       \n| NVIDIA-SMI 361.42     Driver Version: 361.42         |                       \n|-------------------------------+----------------------+----------------------+\n| GPU  Name        Persistence-M| Bus-Id        Disp.A | Volatile Uncorr.

I know that there are many icon theme packages, but really, I think Ubuntu should be able to provide vectorized icons with any settings found in the system. So please no third party packages for the task. \nSystem Ubuntu 14.04 on Macbook Air 2013-mid natively, Linux kernel 4.2.0...-generic, display resolution is 1440x900. I really would like to have vectorised images. In Settings\n\n\n*\n\n*Displays > Scale for menu and title bars: 0.875 which makes the icons rasterized and blurry. \n\n*Appearance > Launcher icon size less than 30. Etc 28 and 24. I cannot reproduce the effect with bigger icons. \n\n\nThe effect is independent of \n\n\n*\n\n*Default theme. You choose Ambience (default), Radiance and High Contrast in Settings > Appearance > Theme. My examples are with High Contrast. \n\n*Background. Choose anything you like. I am using a \"space\" background in the examples. \n\n\n\n\n\nHow can you have Vectorized Unity Icons in Ubuntu 14.04 by Defaults?\n\nA: The default icon theme in Ubuntu does use mostly vector (SVG) icons. For smaller sizes though, icons tend to be raster images, in order for the icons to be pixel perfect.\nHowever, all graphics are going to be rendered into pixels for display. When you scale them to odd sizes, there are going to be artifacts, even for SVG icons.\nFor the best looking app icons in the launcher panel, make sure the launcher icon size is set to a value which is a multiple of 8, such as 32 or 48 pixels.\n", "Q: How do I run a jar so that I can access it on another terminal session later? I know the answer to this question may be screens, but it doesn't seem to be working for me. I've tried creating a new screen session and running it there, then switching back to my main one. However, when I close that terminal completely, all the screens disappear, yet the server is still running. I can no longer get to the jar file while it's running, forcing me to restart the server in order to kill the jar. I've tried kill and pkill after finding the PID of the jar using the top command, but that doesn't work. Am I doing something wrong with screens or is there something else I'm missing? Thanks for any responses.\nTL;DR I need a way to run a jar so I can access it later on another termainal session\n\nA: I figured out the problem. The screen sessions aren't \"disappearing\", they're just detaching. The way I fixed this was by using \"screen -ls\", finding the PID of the screen I wanted, then using \"screen -r \" to reattach the screen and allow access to it.

I want to upgarde to Ubuntu 16.04 via the software updater application. I have lots of data in my laptop. Also I am having useful softwares related with my work.  Now I wish to upgrade my system without losing any data and software. Ca n I do it?. or else what is the procedure to upgrade Ubuntu without losing old data.\n\nA: As @Mark Kirby says, this is a probable duplicate of \"Can I smoothly upgrade from one LTS to next LTS release?\". The basic answer, is yes you can upgrade smoothly from one LTS (long term service) release (say 14.04 LTS) to another (say 16.04) without installing intermediates.\nYou can do this for Desktop LTS releases with the commands:\nsudo do-release-upgrade\n\nor\nsudo update-manager -d\n\n... and for the Server LTS releases with the commands:\nsudo apt-get install update-manager-core\nsudo do-release-upgrade\n\nHOWEVER, I would say that I've watched plenty of \"tested\" software that's relatively widely used break, malfunction, or otherwise work improperly, so I would suggest a basic backup of your home directory to an appropriate form of external storage, i.e.\nmkdir /mnt/<external storage>/May_30_2016_Backup_Ubuntu_16_04_Upgrade\ncp -rf ${HOME}/* May_30_2016*/ &\n\nThis is generally a good practice, as even if everything works perfectly, maybe your hard drive dies tomorrow (also has happened to me).  Now you'll be thankful you have that backup, even if you didn't seemingly need it.\n", "Q: How to Have Better Intel Graphics Drivers on Macbook? I see many graphical artifacts in using Ubuntu 14.04 on Macbook Air 2013-mid. Doing CTRL-Super-[key] causes often a time-lag and sluttering of the graphics (bad sign of the drivers).

I have Ubuntu installed on my laptop and have been using it for quite some time. Yesterday I needed to wipe a drive so I booted my laptop via a USB drive that had the Ultimate Boot Cd and ran Darik’s Boot and Nuke (DBAN) of the external drive. When I rebooted the laptop failed to boot. I get an error: “PXE-E61: Media test failure, check cable”\nSo details: \nOS: Ubuntu 14.04 LTS\nLaptop: Toshiba Satellite P50-B\nHd: PNY Optima Series 240GB SSD (SSD7SC240GOPT-RB)\nUBCD: 1.9.5.7 – DBAN ?\nI booted an ubuntu usb boot image and looked at the drive with gparted. The three partitions are still there: boot sector, data, and linux swap. Furthermore all my data is still there as well (and now backed up). So I’m guessing somehow the boot sector got corrupted? Is there a simple way to fix this or is it just time to install 16.04 and call it a day?\nOk, Thank you Karsus, you reminded me of a comment I forgot to make. In order to run the usb boots I had to switch from UEFI boot to CSM boot. I also switched the boot order but have reverted that. I only get the PXE-E61 error in CSM mode. In UEFI mode I simply get \"Reboot and select proper Boot device or Insert Boot Media in selected Boot device and press a key\". ?\n\nA: According to what's listed there the problem may be in the boot sequence. Try entering the BIOS and checking that everything is correct.\nedit:\nThe new error also suggests you are trying to boot from an incorrect boot device. But since you have reverted the boot order changes it could well be a corrupted boot partition. In that case you probably need to repair grub from a live USB.

No graphics card, using the integrated Intel GPU inside the Core i7 6700.\nUbuntu 16.04 (fresh install) on /dev/sda [Samsung 500G SSD]\nUbuntu 16.04 works fine with this configuration. The EFI points to boot on the SSD.\nThe issue:\nNow, as I like having my old version of Ubuntu around, as a backup, and in case I forgot to reapply some useful tweak, I pulled the Hitachi drive from the old PC and installed it on the new PC.\nSo now I have:\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu 16.04 on /dev/sda [Samsung 500G SDD]\n\n*Ubuntu 14.04 on /dev/sdb [Hitachi 2T HDD]\n\nDid a grub-update on the 16.04 to get the grub menu with the 14.04.\nThe machine still boots fine on 16.04 with the grub menu displayed.\nBut the issue is that it does not boot correctly on the 14.04, when I select it from the grub menu.\nWhat happens:\nIt is like if Ubuntu didn't find at all what hardware I am running, everything seems to be \"by default\".\nI managed to enter the session by removing the NVIDIA drivers on the 14.04, but I get:\n\n*\n\n*Default 1024x768 video (ugly on a 1920 LCD!)\n\n*No ethernet\n\n*No sound\n\nDisks, keyboard and mouse work normally.\nAll that seems \"kind of normal\" as this installation of 14.04 was initially BIOS, and from what I could search, EFI seems to show the hardware differently to the kernel.\nWhat kind of repair I would like:\nThe closest question was this one:\nWhich commands to convert a Ubuntu BIOS install to EFI/UEFI without boot-repair on single boot hardware?\nBut in this post the op didn't have a working machine, which I have (on 16.04) and didn't have an EFI boot installed, which I already have.\nI would prefer to understand what I am doing too, instead of using automated Boot-Repair (which I doubt would do anything clever in my case).\nThe answer to the question above, suggested to install the grub-efi in the version to repair.\nIt does not really work in my case, because:\n\n*\n\n*I don't wish to create an EFI partition on my HDD (/dev/sdb) as I\nalready have a working one on my SSD (/dev/sda) from which I boot.\n\n*if I do a grub-efi-update on the 14.04, asking it to install grub on\n/dev/sda, it will probably overwrite the 16.04 in the efi partition\nwith that of the older 14.04. That is not desirable!\n\nIndeed, I could also dd the beginning of /dev/sda to restore it after 14.04 has overwritten it, but such manipulations are \"dangerous\" and bear a risk of destroying everything!\nI already tried:\nSuccessfully:\n\n*\n\n*removed nVidia drivers so to get a \"minimal\" session on 14.04. With the Nvidia drivers, it was going as far as lightdm, but failed to start the Unity session.\n\nUnsuccessfully:\n\n*\n\n*tried to modprobe e1000e (the ethernet Intel driver used by the\n16.04) and ptp plus pps_core. The modules loaded correctly but didn't provide me with an ethernet interface\n\n*mounting the efi partition on the /etc/fstab, same as it is mounted\nin the 16.04. No difference.\n\n*tried to add insmod efivars by live-editing (Emacs style) the grub\nmenu: does not work, there is no efivars.mod in the 14.04 boot\nmodules list (neither on the 16.04)\n\nWhat I didn't do yet:\nInstall 14.04 in EFI mode on a spare partition I reserved for future use, NOT installing grub-efi if possible (see above), and if not possible, putting it on an USB key I don't care to destroy.\nThen trying to understand the differences from that installed version with the one on my HDD.\nWhat step do you suggest next to avoid a full reinstall of 14.04, or overwriting my 16.04 efi grub?\n\nI would like the kernel to guess the drivers \"automatically\", as it is supposed to do when you don't disrupt it with BIOS/EFI issues.\nHere is my understanding of the issue I can't solve (by lack of clear documentation).\nBoot process: (as far as I understand it)\n\n*\n\n*Power on button\n\n*EFI (or BIOS) starts and scans the hardware\n\n*Start reading from whatever storage device is parameterized for an\n\"initial loader\" (MBR, EFI loader...)\n\n*With EFI it goes through the EFI partition, runs some of the\nexecutables there (for example shimx64.efi to circumvent the M$-Secure-Lockdown feature), which are capable of minimal-mounting Linux\npartitions like ext2/3/4. Read from the grub.cfg that is there to\nfind where the \"real\" grub loader is.\n\n*Starts that \"real\" grub loader (on /dev/sda3 for me).\n\n*This \"real\" grub-loader (from the 16.04) reads the menu which\ncontains lines for the current version (16.04), recoveries and lines\nfrom the old 14.04 I added.\n\n*When I choose 14.04 it then starts the correct vmlinuz on /dev/sdb1 with the corresponding initrd image.\n\n*From there the kernel is loaded and will try to get the correct drivers for the machine (modules). It can do that from the /etc/modules (\"manual\" method) or by looking at your configuration as it is reported by BIOS/EFI (\"automatic\" method).\n\n*When the system is set as EFI, the way the kernel will look at your configuration is through efivars, for which I found some documentation here: https://firmware.intel.com/blog/accessing-uefi-variables-linux.\nBasically, there is pseudo filesystem in /sys/firmware/efi that allows the kernel to query your configuration and act accordingly.\n\nMy guess is that obviously a BIOS-installed system does otherwise. The way for the kernel to query the BIOS being different and the system being booted as EFI, the kernel finds \"no hardware\"... and so initializes only a default machine.\nHow to tell that old installation of 14.04: \"now you have been booted through EFI, please use efivars to get the hardware details\".\nDon't hesitate to correct me if I was grossly wrong in my assumptions of the (simplified) description of the boot process, and to point me to any useful links about that.\n\nA: To recap: you moved a BIOS booting 14.04 disk to a UEFI 16.04 system, reran update-grub, and can now boot the 14.04 system, but have video/driver problems.  Your solution is to uninstall all the (old system) proprietary drivers to get back to a default system, then install any new drivers.  \nClick on the \"Settings\" button on \"software updater\", under the \"Ubuntu Software\" tab, click on the \"proprietary drivers...\" button, and under the \"additional drivers\" tab see which proprietary drivers are offered, and click on the ones you want (and maybe reboot).  Nothing happens automatically.  \nYou might also want to install the backports to the 14.04 system to get a more up-to-date kernel for your 6700.  That's it.  No \"conversion\" needed.  So what if your moved 14.04 updates change the (unused) grub.cfg on that system -- you just rerun update-grub on the 16.04 system.  So what if it doesn't have any reference to /boot/efi (although you could add that easily enough with a line in the /etc/fstab file).  You don't have a boot problem at all.\n\nA: I give up the idea to convert the old installation from BIOS to EFI.\nInstead, I'll use @oldfred's suggestion to dual-boot through the MotherBoard when I need it.\nThis has in fact advantages:\n\n\n*\n\n*I don't need to have a Grub-Menu waiting (even 3 seconds) to boot in\nmy everyday system (16.04), thus I'll save time booting.\n\n*When I want to boot the old system (14.04), hitting F8 at startup is\nnot harder than the arrow keys!\n\n*I can keep my BIOS install on /dev/sdb because my motherboard can\nboot both EFI and BIOS, thus when booting 14.04, it will be in BIOS\nmode.\n\n\nAnyway, even in BIOS mode I drivers don't load, but as this is another issue, I'll do another question to try and fix these drivers.\nThis question is therefore closed, nevertheless if you find a good documentation about the detailed boot process of a Linux Box, I'll be delighted to read it!\n", "Q: Ubuntu Software Icon?

The whole time I've been using it, I've had some issues with the headphones that I haven't been able to resolve. \nThe issue is multifaceted. The main problem is that the audio doesn't automatically switch to the headphones when they are plugged in. \nWhat happens instead is that the audio comes from both the computer speakers and the headphones, but while the speaker volume is adjustable, the headphones are blaring very loudly and don't respond to volume controls.\nI can manually go into the sound settings and select the Digital Output (S/PDIF) option, but I would like for this to happen automatically. \nI also don't think that the headphones jack is actually S-PDIF.

When I launch gparted from GUI it looks like an \"old windows 95\" (or something like that) application, but when I type sudo gparted it has this Kubuntu look.\n\n\nI saw similar behavior on Xubuntu 16.04 with SimpleScan\n\nA: Themes are implemented on a per user basis. Installing one for your user won't result in a change to the root theme. launching with sudo results in the use of roots profile rather than your own. You can prove this to yourself rather simply. the command sudo -i will launch an interactive shell with sudo permissions. None of the scripts in your ~/bin directory will respond to tab completion like they would if you were under your own profile and the command pwd clearly shows you are in the /root directory as sudo rather than the home/you directory (where you is your username).\n", "Q: Can't extend root partition I realize this question has been asked several times, but it's never answered so I have to start a new thread as I'm not yet allowed to comment on other's posts.\nI have booted from a gparted.iso and attempted to extend my root partition into the adjacent free space. It just sits there for days at the point in this screen-shot:\n\nHas anyone encountered and resolved this?  Are there alternatives to gparted?\n\nA: From your screenshot it looks like GParted is stuck on the disk scan.  Either that or it is finding LOTS of errors.\nReboot if you can off of a Live CD or USB and go to a terminal session.  Make sure you don't mount the partition before continuing.\nRun this command: e2fsck -f -v -c -C 0 /dev/sda1\nNow you'll be able to see what's going on with the e2fsck scan.\nIf you're getting many errors that can be fixed, you can either continue saying \"yes\", or reboot again and add -y to the e2fsck command above so you don't have to keep saying yes to repair every error (It will say \"yes\" automatically).\nIf you're getting bad superblock errors, you'll have to recover it this way:\nRun as root (sudo) : dumpe2fs /dev/sda1 | grep -i superblock\nYou should see an output like this:\n  Primary superblock at 0, Group descriptors at 1-2\n  Backup superblock at 32768, Group descriptors at 32769-32770\n  Backup superblock at 98304, Group descriptors at 98305-98306\n  Backup superblock at 163840, Group descriptors at 163841-163842\n  Backup superblock at 229376, Group descriptors at 229377-229378\n  Backup superblock at 294912, Group descriptors at 294913-294914\n  Backup superblock at 819200, Group descriptors at 819201-819202\n  Backup superblock at 884736, Group descriptors at 884737-884738\n  Backup superblock at 1605632, Group descriptors at 1605633-1605634\n  Backup superblock at 2654208, Group descriptors at 2654209-2654210\n  Backup superblock at 4096000, Group descriptors at 4096001-4096002\n\nNow choose one of the backup superblock to run this command as root:\ne2fsck -f -b 32768 /dev/sda1\nAnd then run\ne2fsck -f -v -y -c -C 0 /dev/sda1 to do one more full check.\nIf everything went cleanly, and it did some repairs, try running GParted again to try resizing the partition now.\n\nA: To change partition size its a good idea to work on it while its unmounted ... so boot up from a LiveCD then use gparted to modify the partition when its in an unmounted state (IE. not booted from) \n\nA: To get further information of why it's not working, you need to expand the \ne2fsck part, so we know at which part e2fsck is stuck.\nIt could be cause of faulty hardware (some harddrives simply don't respond when they can't read certain sectors, because they have no real timeout, so stuff becomes very slow), but before somebody can say that we need more input.\nHowever yes, there are alternatives, but be aware that the part it's stuck on, is an integrity check to avoid data loss etc.\nIn case you want to ignore it, you can resize the partitions manually by using parted or fdisk and resize2fs.\nBe aware that resizing always comes with the risk of losing data.\nhttps://wiki.hetzner.de/index.php/Resize_Ext_Partition/en\nThis site contains a short guide on how to resize manually (and even skips the fsck part, what you should normally do and NOT skip, if possible).\nWhat's done is basically replacing the current partition in the partition/filesystem table with a bigger one (it looks like you already had the free space)\nThen make the filesystem use all the available space it has.\nElse, here is a more complicated one:\nhttps://www.howtoforge.com/linux_resizing_ext3_partitions\nYou might want to try this first:\nLooking at the output of GParted, I think the space is already correct inside the table, including correct start and end sectors, so you might try:\nsudo resize2fs -p /dev/sda1\n\nThis should not be harmful.\nEDIT:\nOnly needed if resizing directly doesn't work.\nI myself prefer the following way, buy it can break your HD badly, when not done correctly. However I think of it as more safe, as soon as you safe the backup on a USB stick.\nhttps://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/76101/extending-a-partition-by-resize2fs\n\nA: I was initially using the i686 version of the ISO which was giving me problems.  i downloaded the AMD64 version and it worked as expected\n", "Q: How to change the priority of the process using command line I got the following problem when I used this command :\nrenice -19 1744 \n\n\n\nA: It does not require root permissions to lower the priority of any process that you own:\n$ sleep 100 &\n[1] 6965\n$ renice 19 6965\n6965 (process ID) old priority 0, new priority 19\n\nRaising the priority does require root permission:\n$ renice -19 6965\nrenice: failed to set priority for 6965 (process ID): Permission denied\n\n$ sudo renice -19 6965\n6965 (process ID) old priority 0, new priority -19\n\nIn sum, raising the priority requires root privilege: use sudo.\n", "Q: SYMLINK in udev rule I created a udev rule named \"/etc/udev/rules.d/75-myusb.rules\".\nThe only thing inside it is this line:\nSUBSYSTEM==\"usb\", SYMLINK+=\"myusb\"\n\nAfter creating it I plugged a USB drive and a file named myusb is indeed created inside /dev\n\nSince it is a SYMLINK I did assume that I can use it to navigate into the USB. But it doesn't work that way.\n\nAm I misunderstanding what a SYMLINK can do or am I missing something here? \n\nA: Your symlink points to the device file associated with the USB drive. That's different from the mount point where you can access the file system on your USB drive.\nAs a device file is not a directory you can't use cd with a device file or a symlink pointing to a device file.\n", "Q: wifi don't work with xubuntu on dell inspiron 10 I 've installed xubuntu 16.04 on a dell inspiron mini 10.

Currently using the NVIDIA 361.42 proprietary drivers available through the driver options.\nI tried the solution here by putting a configuration file in /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d as well as this solution to no avail.\n\nA: I might be a little late here, but since you are using a NVIDIA graphics card the problem can be solved by editing nvidia-settings (make sure nvidia-settings is installed):\n\n*\n\n*Open nvidia-settings (as root, via sudo).\n\n\n*Go to XServer Display Configuration.\n\n\n*Click on Advanced.\n\n\n*Enable Force full composition pipeline or Force composition pipeline (depends on what feels best for you).\n\n\n*Make sure to hit Save to x configuration file.\nThis solves almost all screen-tearing related problems with proprietary NVIDIA drivers.\n", "Q: If I dual boot Ubuntu 16.04 will my files that are not related to the Operating System stay on that PC If I install Ubuntu 16.04 to run along with Windows 8 will my personal files such as Steam, Antivirus, and documents be deleted?\n\nA: No. That's the whole point of a dual-boot: to keep one OS intact, while also having another OS installed alongside the first.\nBe careful, though. Make sure that you are choosing the right option (the Install Ubuntu alongside Windows option). This will shrink the Windows partition to half its original size and install Ubuntu in the newly created space. Do not choose any options that include the word erase or wipe or any synonym of either.\nIf there is no option for a dual-boot, you will have to do some somewhat advanced partitioning and options. They aren't difficult, but they can easily be messed up. If you run into the problem of only seeing Wipe Hard Drive and Install Ubuntu and Something Else... as options, comment and I can provide you with an existing Q&A. Please don't ask a new question about it, as it will be closed as a duplicate.\n\nA: It depends on how you are planning on implementing the dual boot.

I have two files. One file has the name gcc and is a shell file. Another file has the name g++ and contains data like this: \n!&lt;symlink&gt;ÿþg c c\n\nI can run the shell file gcc but the file g++ cannot run. When I try I see this error:\nbash: ./g++: cannot execute binary file\n\nCan anyone explain why I see this error?\noutput of ls -l for this file:\n-rwxrwxrwx 1 root root 20 May 18 11:43 g++\n\n\nA: When you execute ls -l in the directory (in your video), you can see that g++ is not a symlink. Here is what a symlink from my system looks like:\nlrwxrwxrwx   1 root root    10 May 28 20:20 modules.conf -> ../modules\n\nNote the string at the beginning: lrwxrwxrwx - all symlinks have this.\nYou can also tell that your file g++ is not a symlink, because when you open it, instead of seeing the contents of the file it points to, you see some other data.\nIf a file is not readable, for example it doesn't have a known header or magic number file name-of-file will return data and programs may decide it is a 'binary file'. Type man file for more about this.\nTo workaround this part of your problem just replace the files by making symlinks to replace the broken files, for example:\nTo create a symlink to your file gcc named g++ in the directory do this:\nln -s gcc g++\n\nAnd then ls -l to check. You should see something like:\nlrwxrwxrwx  1 zanna zanna    3 May 31 08:38 g++ -> gcc\n-rwxrwxr-x  1 zanna zanna    0 May 31 08:38 gcc\n\nBut whether your envsetup script will then run is... another question.\nHow did this happen?\nBeyond the scope of the question really, but for further investigation:\nYou mention that your attempt to build the environment throws stray \\376 and \\377. This is octal notation for \\255 and \\254 which is a Byte Order Mark showing that a file uses UTF-16 encoding. UTF-16 (little endian) encoding is also represented by the characters ÿþ which you see in your not-symlink. These bits of code will be reported as 'stray' if they occur anywhere other than at the beginning of a file. Windows (NTFS) and other filesystems use UTF-16 LE encoding for filenames (and the Unicode strings that store their version of symlinks) so this could be happening because parts of the pathnames are in such a filesystem. Again, fix by making new symlinks.\nYou can't turn a regular file into a symlink because in general symlink-ness is metadata stored in the filesystem, in inode tables.\nHowever, since there are symlink implementations that store the path data inside the file, and this method could be used as a fallback in the event that there are not enough inodes available to store symlink paths, this might have happened because you don't have enough inodes in the partition (have a look with df -i .)\n", "Q: Getting native resolution on Ubuntu 16.04 EDIT: I Managed to get 1080p working after using 1920 1080 59 instead of 60 :)\nI have a 22 inch LCD TV connected to my PC (IntelHD 4400 graphics) via VGA a cable.

Done\n  Calculating upgrade...\n\nTo see what packages have been upgraded after you have run a mass upgrading, apt maintains a log of the packages you installed in\n/var/log/apt/history.log\n\n\nA: Simulate apt operation (dry-run)\nBoth apt and apt-get support a simulation mode via the --dry-run parameter.\nThis means you could simulate as follows\nsudo apt upgrade --dry-run\n\nor \nsudo apt-get upgrade --dry-run\n\nas well as for distribution upgrades\nsudo apt dist-upgrade --dry-run\n\nShow upgradable packages (via apt list)\nWith apt list you can output a list of upgradable packages like that\nsudo apt list --upgradable\n\nLogs: Query /var/log/dpkg.log\nRegarding getting informations about changes done to a system it might be helpful to check /var/log/dpkg.log.\nExamples\nThe entire log\ncat /var/log/dpkg.log | less\n\nSee installed packages (new)\ncat /var/log/dpkg.log | grep 'install '\n\nSee upgrades packages\ncat /var/log/dpkg.log | grep 'upgrade '\n\nSee removed packages\ncat /var/log/dpkg.log | grep 'remove '\n\nLogs: Query /var/log/apt/history.log\nThere is a second log which contains apt informations - check /var/log/apt/history.log.\ncat /var/log/apt/history.log | less\n\n\nA: An alternative is simply apt list, i.e... after performing an apt update, or otherwise being told that updates are available, perform the following to see them...\nsudo apt list --upgradable \n\n", "Q: xdg-open stopped working since 16.04 upgrade xdg-mime query default inode/directory\n\ncorrectly gives me:\nnemo.desktop\n\nlike I expect, and want it to.\nBut\nxdg-open $HOME\n\nGives an error:\nxdg-mime: mimetype argument missing\nTry 'xdg-mime --help' for more information.\nUnescaped left brace in regex is deprecated, passed through in regex; marked by <-- HERE in m/%{ <-- HERE (.*?)}/ at /usr/bin/run-mailcap line 528.\nWarning: program returned non-zero exit code #66\n\n...and opens Audacious.\nI tried editing the run-mailcap line to escape the braces, and that gets rid of that error message. But it doesn't fix the problem.\nI still get \"mimetype argument missing\" and the wrong program opens.\nI tried uninstalling Audacious, and it opens a different wrong program instead (git-cola and chrome).\nI tried sudo apt-get install --reinstall xdg-utils and it didn't change anything.\nedit: more information, the above described behavior happens in both Cinnamon and Gnome, but not in Lubuntu LXDE. In LXDE, the query gives nemo.desktop, and xdg-open does not produce any error messages in the terminal, but it opens PCManFM (not nemo).\nIs that a clue to what is wrong or how to fix it?\n\nA: I had exactly the same problem.\nI could solve the problem by just install gvfs-bin (nothing more)...\nsudo apt install gvfs-bin\nI found this out, because in the log-files from user Amias is to read:\ngvfs-open /home/amias\nBut gvfs-open was not installed on my system.\nAfter installing gvfs-bin, it works!\nTo set a new file association (e.g use Nemo for folders), you can do:\ngvfs-mime --set inode/directory nemo.desktop\n-Cheers\n\nA: Okay, it seems as though a patch was released for others having similar issues judging by this article:\nhttps://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=810587\nIn this article the person was encountering:\n\"Unescaped left brace in regex is deprecated, passed through in regex; marked by <-- HERE in m/%{ <-- HERE (.*?)}/ at /usr/bin/run-mailcap line 528.\"\nwhile running nmh which seems similar to your error message except for a different program. So I would recommend running:\nsudo apt-get upgrade;sudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\nAs the affected package might have an upgraded version available with the patch.\nI hope this helps.\nNOTE: This will upgrade all packages that can be upgraded (which is a good thing regardless) so don't be suprised if multiple packages want to upgrade.\n\nA: xdg-open is a shell script so you can debug it with -x\nbash -x /usr/bin/xdg-open $HOME\n\nthis gives me output like this \n+ check_common_commands /home/amias\n+ '[' 1 -gt 0 ']'\n+ parm=/home/amias\n+ shift\n+ case \"$parm\" in\n+ '[' 0 -gt 0 ']'\n+ '[' -z '' ']'\n+ unset XDG_UTILS_DEBUG_LEVEL\n+ '[' 0 -lt 1 ']'\n+ xdg_redirect_output=' > /dev/null 2> /dev/null'\n+ '[' x/home/amias '!=' x ']'\n+ url=\n+ '[' 1 -gt 0 ']'\n+ parm=/home/amias\n+ shift\n+ case \"$parm\" in\n+ '[' -n '' ']'\n+ url=/home/amias\n+ '[' 0 -gt 0 ']'\n+ '[' -z /home/amias ']'\n+ detectDE\n+ unset GREP_OPTIONS\n+ '[' -n Unity ']'\n+ case \"${XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP}\" in\n+ '[' x = x ']'\n+ '[' x '!=' x ']'\n+ '[' xthis-is-deprecated '!=' x ']'\n+ DE=gnome\n+ '[' xgnome = x ']'\n+ '[' xgnome = x ']'\n+ '[' xgnome = xgnome ']'\n+ which gnome-default-applications-properties\n+ DE=gnome3\n+ '[' xgnome3 = x ']'\n+ DEBUG 2 'Selected DE gnome3'\n+ '[' -z '' ']'\n+ return 0\n+ case \"${BROWSER}\" in\n+ case \"$DE\" in\n+ open_gnome3 /home/amias\n+ gvfs-open --help\n+ gvfs-open /home/amias\n+ '[' 0 -eq 0 ']'\n+ exit_success\n+ '[' 0 -gt 0 ']'\n+ exit 0\n\nThis is from a working installation of xdg-open on 64bit 16.04.\nI've shown you mine now you show me yours.\nedit:\nlooking at your output i can see that open_generic_xdg_mime is failing to return a mime type and this is preventing the script from choosing the right service.  A simple workaround would be to create a script called open_generic_xdg_mime and make it run 'file -i' against its input , this will give you the mime type but you will need to tidy the output a little with something like cut. let me know if you need a hand with that.\n\nA: The problem is due to gvfs-info being deprecated. \nLine 635 in xdg-mime is using gvfs-info for gnome.\nbash\ngvfs-info \"$1\" 2> /dev/null | grep standard::content-type | cut -d' ' -f4\n\nI tried to re-evaluate that line manually here is the result:\ngvfs-info ~/test.pdf|grep standard::content-type| cut -d' ' -f4\nThis tool has been deprecated, use 'gio info' instead.\nSee 'gio help info' for more info.\n\n/usr/bin/gvfs-info: 10: [: ~/test.pdf: unexpected operator\n/usr/bin/gvfs-info: 10: [: ~/test.pdf: unexpected operator\napplication/pdf\n\nThen I tried using gio info:\ngio info ~/test.pdf|grep standard::content-type| cut -d' ' -f4\napplication/pdf\n\nSo I temporarily changed the block for info_gnome() in xdg-mime to use gio info instead and bam, it worked! \n631 info_gnome()                                                                     \n632 {                                                                                \n633     if gvfs-info --help 2>/dev/null 1>&2; then                                   \n634         DEBUG 1 \"Running gvfs-info \\\"$1\\\"\"                                       \n635         gnomevfs-info \"$1\" 2> /dev/null | grep standard::content-type | cut -d' ' -f4 \n636     elif gnomevfs-info --help 2>/dev/null 1>&2; then                             \n637         DEBUG 1 \"Running gnomevfs-info \\\"$1\\\"\"                                   \n638         gnomevfs-info --slow-mime \"$1\" 2> /dev/null | grep \"^MIME\" | cut -d \":\" -f 2 | sed s/\"^ \"//\n639     else                                                                         \n640         DEBUG 1 \"Running gio info \\\"$1\\\"\"                                        \n641         gio info \"$1\" 2> /dev/null | grep standard::content-type | cut -d' ' -f4 \n642     fi                                                                           \n643     if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then                                                        \n644         exit_success                                                             \n645     else                                                                         \n646         exit_failure_operation_failed                                            \n647     fi                                                                           \n648 }\n\n", "Q: ethernet not detecting Ethernet is not detected in ubuntu14.04.

You can upgrade your old filesystem to activate this option.\nBefore you start\n\n*\n\n*This size of volume must be backed by RAID. Regular disk errors will cause harm otherwise.\n\n*Still, RAID is not a backup. You must have your valuables stored elsewhere as well.\n\n*First resize & verify all surrounding volumes (partition tables, encryption, lvm).\n\n*After making changes to RAID, linux may not immediately acknowledge the new maximum size.

This machine got literally only needed stuff on the CLI Debian just to stream, so I'm not losing any resources.\nI was quite sure i can push the quality as faster/veryfast with this rig.\nAfter using ffmpeg 3.0.22 backports on Jessie i can say there is a slight performance boost and the quality of stream seems to be better, but still the veryfast preset is killing dual core cpu with 200% usage.\nCould anyone elaborate on the topic?\n\nA: After doing quite a lot of research, it seems that Athlon X2 64 4200+ is not capable of pushing 720p video at 30 frame rate at veryfast/faster preset.\nI need something stronger to maintain the transmission, so the CPU need to have more power.\n", "Q: 16.04: Just cant figure out where did i go wrong with my LAMP and wordpress installation I have installed and reinstalled LAMP+Wordpress, but when i check it on my browser it is not working.

I didn't pay attention, and used useradd -ou 0 -g 0 new_user_name, which gave root permissions to the user. It also has the same UID of 0. \nBefore I do something stupid, can anyone help me on how to delete this user, or simply change the permissions/UID? I already discovered what happens with pkill. Hahaha.\n\nA: userdel has an option -f to force removal. userdel would probably just delete the passwd entry and home directory, without affecting the actual root account.\nTo be safer, I might be inclined to hand-edit the password file to remove the entry for your new root user, then hand-remove new root user's home directory.

This is, apparently fixed in Qt 5.5.1. In fact, Qt 5 apps correctly set style to GTK+ on 16.04 Xfce (Qt 5.5.1, no Qt5Ct).\nInstead, you will have to use a third-party configuration tool, Qt5Ct.\nYou would have had to build Qt5Ct from source, but the WebUpd8 PPA packaged it.\nsudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:nilarimogard/webupd8\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt install qt5ct\n\n\nAs in the picture, \n\n\n*\n\n*Set the Style to GTK+.\n\n*In the Icon Theme tab, select the icon theme you use. \n\n*Set the font (in the Fonts tab).

I'm running OpenVPN as an upstart script on Ubuntu Server 14.04 LTS. I have an openvpn.conf file in the /etc/init/ folder.\nIt works perfectly, OpenVPN starts on system start and connects to VPN server. However, I also run Deluge and some other services that I need explicitly to allow connection to Internet only through VPN.\nDeluged is also started as with an upstart script, and actually it is working perfectly fine.\nOne thing I'm not sure: what is the sequence of of starting these services during the system start? I need OpenVPN to start before Deluge service. I really read a lot about start-on parameters, but I'm not sure if it is enough to put this into the upstart script. \nI see a similar questions here: LINK\nAccording to this, it can not be done with upstart script, only if I use a \"wait script\"?\nWhat do I need to put in openvpn.conf and deluged.conf upstart scripts to make this work?\nMany thanks!\n\nA: The numerical order of system services is displayed in /etc/rc2.d where higher number means later, you can change thos numbers.\nAlso you could add delay in seconds option into deluged startup script, example\n    sleep 10\n\n", "Q: fsck at boot - Ubuntu 12.04LTS My Dell Inspiron 3542 with Ubuntu 12.04 LTS runs fsck every time it boots and therefore i cannot get past the boot splash screen - anything to do ? can i remove 12.04 completely and install 14.04LTS ? \n\nA: A running fsck at startup indicates that you have a problem with your partition on your disk. \nRun this when you are at prompt \ne2fsck -y /dev/sdx# \n\nWhere \"#\" is the disk interface you have installed Ubuntu, to correct the problem.\nAlternatively, maybe there is a option in your fstab file and runs all the time because of this.\n# <file system> <mount point> <type> <options> <dump> <pass>\nproc /proc proc nodev,noexec,nosuid 0 0\n# / was on /dev/sdb5 during installation\nUUID=136f3cdf-c824-4f8a-8bac-d86faaf17f63 / ext3 errors=remount-ro 0 1\n# /home was on /dev/sdb6 during installation\nUUID=eb55f063-766c-45fd-8ee3-93f33cc735b5 /home ext3 defaults 0 2\n\nThe numbers \"1\" or \"2\" in the last column controls when fsck runs.

I've tried the steps described in this post, but somehow Not software rendered and Unity 3D supported are still disabled after completing all the steps and a full reboot.\nI don't know why - maybe this has something to do with the fact that I'm running on Ubuntu 15.

Having an older version of Virtual box and installing the latest version of guest additions causes problems. \nAnother interesting thing, It didn't work after installing the guest additions when I was notified by the virtual box immediately after the update to install the newer available version of Guest addition.

I want to prevent crashing if I type unity in terminal by mistake. (It's because I'm currently using Unity3D so I get confused sometimes) Or maybe I want to get a warning message. \n\nA: The reason it crashes is because that command will try to start a new unity session but you're already running one.

Clearly I miss understand something here; this did not happen.\nEither way, with or without the lines in comment, the result is still the same, ip addresses are there, but no internet...\n\nA: the manual has the following example: \nauto eth0 eth0:1\niface eth0 inet static \n  address 192.168.0.100 \n  network 192.168.0.0 \n  netmask 255.255.255.0 \n  broadcast 192.168.0.255 \n  gateway 192.168.0.1 \niface eth0:1 inet static \n address 192.168.0.200 \n network 192.168.0.0 \n netmask 255.255.255.0\n\n\n\n*\n\n*the pseudo interface to the same auto line, but I don't know if that matters\n\n*remove the name tag or indent it properly.\n\n*your network for the second interface doesn't make sense. it should be a 192 address based on your IP and mask.\n\n\nA: After some further research, I found that one of my earlier trials did work. The interface file looks like:\nauto eth0\niface eth0 inet dhcp\n\nauto eth0:1\niface eth0:1 inet static\naddress 192.168.3.11\nnetmask 255.255.255.0\nbroadcast 192.168.3.255\n\nNote that  the network icon in the top right corner of your screen shows that there is no connection, but internet works just fine. Probably this was the thing I missed and concluded that my internet was down because of the network icon.\n", "Q: Loop trough all folders recursively end execute make command when Makefile present I really suck in bash scripting, so i'm hoping on your help guys. I need a script which will loop trough all folders, sub folders, sub sub folders, etc. inside folder /home/work and if there is present file Makefile then it should execute command make install\nFolder structure is random, for example /home/work\n - Dir 1\n - - Dir 1.1\n - - Dir 1.2\n - - - Makefile\n - Dir 2\n - - Makefile\n - Dir 3\n - - Dir 3.1\n - - Dir 3.2\n - - - Dir 3.2.1\n - - - Makefile\n - - MakeFile\n\nThis is what i have so far\nfor f in /home/work/*;\n  do\n     [ -d $f ] && cd \"$f\" && echo Entering into $f && make install\n  done;\n\nIf you need any additional information's please let me know and i will provide.\n\nA: Using find:\nfind /home/work -type f -name Makefile -execdir make install \\;\n\nfind recursively searches /home/work for files (-type f) named Makefile (-name Makefile) and runs make install in the directory where the file was found (-execdir make install \\;).\nAlternatively, if you're using bash, enable ** (which is recursive):\nshopt -s extglob\n\nThen do:\nfor f in /home/work/**/;\ndo\n     [[ -f $f/Makefile ]] && echo Entering into \"$f\" && make -C \"$f\" install\ndone\n\nWith a trailing slash after the wildcard, bash will only select directories, so you can eliminate that check. And make has an option to change directories before starting: -C. So, we can avoid the cd as well:\n-C dir, --directory=dir\n    Change  to  directory  dir  before  reading the makefiles or doing\n    anything else.  If multiple -C  options  are  specified,  each  is\n    interpreted  relative  to  the  previous  one:  -C  /  -C  etc  is\n    equivalent to -C /etc.  This  is  typically  used  with  recursive\n    invocations of make.\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu Touch - Webcam chat app I have a Ubuntu tablet and so does my son. We want to use an app like Skype to have chats when he is overseas. I downloaded Skype the other day hoping to be able to have these webcam chats. However, there does not seem to be any option to hold cam chats. There is no option either in Telegram. So is there any paps that I can install where we can hold cam chats between our two tablets?\n\nA: I currently feel that there is a need for more than one option when wishing to make video calles with the Ubuntu Tablets. At present, I have only been able to get Google Hangouts to work, via the web version. The apps that are in the store, do not allow the microphone or camera to connect, they are blocked. Also on the web version, the front camera cannot be activated, just the rear. So instrad of the person you are talking to seeing your face, they can only see your feel. However, based on the fact that there is a way to make video calls on the tablets, I am closing this question and will maintain the following Enable camera in Google Hangouts, to resolve the issues with Hangouts, as described above.\n", "Q: Running out of inodes constantly, sessionclean throwing up errors I keep running out of inodes (Ubuntu 14.04).\nIn my root mail I get the following message:\nFrom root@web.site.com  Sun May 29 04:09:01 2016\nReturn-Path: <root@web.site.com>\nX-Original-To: root\nDelivered-To: root@web.site.com\nReceived: by web.site.com (Postfix, from userid 0)\n    id 7D8B41A230A; Sun, 29 May 2016 04:09:01 -0400 (EDT)\nFrom: root@web.site.com (Cron Daemon)\nTo: root@web.site.com\nSubject: Cron <root@web>   [ -x /usr/lib/php5/sessionclean ] && /usr/lib/php5/sessionclean\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=ANSI_X3.4-1968\nX-Cron-Env: <SHELL=/bin/sh>\nX-Cron-Env: <HOME=/root>\nX-Cron-Env: <PATH=/usr/bin:/bin>\nX-Cron-Env: <LOGNAME=root>\nMessage-Id: <20160529080901.7D8B41A230A@web.site.com>\nDate: Sun, 29 May 2016 04:09:01 -0400 (EDT)\n\n/usr/lib/php5/sessionclean: 12: /usr/lib/php5/sessionclean: php5: not found\n\nI believe that the last part refers to line 12 of the sessionclean file?

Also on the maas server I couldn't nslookup, for example node01.maas (which is the name of deployed node) or its address 10.1.1.101, or even maas itself. When I nslookup maas.maas this is what I get:\nali@maas:~$ nslookup maas.maas\nServer:         172.16.0.159\nAddress:        172.16.0.159#53\n\nNon-authoritative answer:\nName:   maas.maas\nAddress: 104.239.213.7\nName:   maas.maas\nAddress: 198.105.254.11\n\nAs you can see it shows some arbitrary addresses and it comes from the nameserver (172.16.0.159) which meant to handle public network not private one where nodes are laid on.\nI've also followed some instructions for packet forwarding on maas server mentioned at lower part of this page: \"http://www.openstackbasement.com/home/landscape-openstack-juju-won-t-bootstrap\" to no avail.

Not sure.\n\nA: I've had the same problem with Jaybird X2 and Bluebuds X, although other Bluetooth audio devices worked without problems. With the headphones, I got this error:\nAssertion 'pa_channels_valid(channels)' failed at pulse/volume.c:74, function pa_cvolume_set(). Aborting.\n\nand pulseaudio crashed. What solved it was installing pulseaudio from sources:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install all required packages: sudo apt-get build-dep pulseaudio\n\n*Download https://freedesktop.org/software/pulseaudio/releases/pulseaudio-9.0.tar.gz and unpack.\n\n*In the source dir, run: ./bootstrap.sh --prefix=/usr. If you want, you can change the CFLAGS variable to enable compiler optimizations, e.g. use -O2 instead of -O0. \n\n*Then, make and sudo make install\nThis will overwrite the default system installation, but it will work until packages get updated. To prevent updates, we can put the pulseaudio packages on hold: \nsudo apt-mark hold libpulse-dev libpulse0 libpulse-mainloop-glib0 pulseaudio pulseaudio-module-bluetooth pulseaudio-utils libpulsedsp pulseaudio-module-x11\n\nNote that I installed pulseaudio 9.0, but it is not the version that made it work. I tried using the packaged version of pulseaudio 9.0 from the PPA, but it also crashed with the same error.\n\nA: I had this issue with my Bluedio T+3 headset and what I think is happening is that there is a connection timeout. You need to uncomment the line ; exit-idle-time = 20 in the file /etc/pulse/daemon.conf by removing the semicolon (;).\nChange the value to -1 to become:\nexit-idle-time = -1\n\nAfter that use bluetoothctl again to try and connect to the device. See here for instructions:\nArch wiki: bluetooth headset\n\nA: It is a known bug. Try rmmod btusb ; modprobe btusb. I have had to do it up to four times.\nI have seen this with my Lenovo P50 with Intel 8260 wifi/bluetooth. Sometimes the bluetooth firmware doesn't load correctly at boot. Other times it just doesn't work.\n\nA: Ensure the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Jaybird X2 is paired\n\n*it is marked as trusted (either via bluetoothctl and trust XX:XX:XX:XX (where XX:XX:XX:XX is the MAC address of your Jaybird) or via blueman-manager)\n\n*it is turned on\n\n\nPress the power button of your Jaybird X2 once. This probably triggers an auto-connect to known devices. So you may need to ensure that other devices do not interfere here. From then on the connection was stable and it also connects automatically after a reboot.\nLet me know whether this also solved your problem. I did also a lot of other things and was nearly giving up, when I accidently pressed the power button ;-) So it could also be that one of those other things solved the issue. (was already searching and trying things around bluetooth, pulseaudio, bluez, pactl load-module whatever; so I have still a lot of other hints :-D)\nUPDATE (after having connection issues again)\nAfter I connected Jaybird X2 to my android phone, I was not able to reconnect to my laptop again, even after I've dropped the connection from my android phone. Don't know yet, what exactly is the problem here, but to get the connection back, I had to do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*disconnect Jaybird X2 from my android phone (or any other device)\n\n*reboot ubuntu\n\n*reconnecting works and the connection is stable (it usually did not work when pairing the first time... I also required a reboot after that)\n\n\nI also tried some other things and it seems that at least pulseaudio-module-bluetooth is required. Also the wifi/bluetooth coexistence-configuration is required at least on my machine ( see: https://askubuntu.com/a/645072/558838 ).\nAnd last but not least: a reboot is always required to get the connection back in case I switched to another device.\nTo summarize: with that reboot-step I am able to reconnect the Jaybird X2 successfully and the connection is stable.\nIf anyone knows an easier way to omit the reboot-step, please contribute :)\n/etc/init.d/bluetooth restart does not suffice.\n(additional steps I've tried):\nI looked into my history. I tried also the following where one or the other might have contributed to the solution above:\n\n\n*\n\n*apt-get install pulseaudio-module-bluetooth (on my system it wasn't installed)\n\n*logs mentioned something about missing ofono, so I also installed that\n\n*did a sudo chown -R $USER ~/*\n\n*also applied: https://askubuntu.com/a/691299/558838 (However I reverted it as it didn't help. But it might still have been active, when I tried the auto-connect)\n\n*did also purge/install the pulseaudio, blueman, bluetooth packag\n\n\nA: Run the script here on GitHub\nAnd the problem will vanish.\n#! /usr/bin/env python3.5\n\"\"\"\n\nFixing bluetooth stereo headphone/headset problem in ubuntu 16.04 and also debian jessie, with bluez5.\n\nWorkaround for bug: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/indicator-sound/+bug/1577197\nRun it with python3.5 or higher after pairing/connecting the bluetooth stereo headphone.\n\nThis will be only fixes the bluez5 problem mentioned above .\n\nLicence: Freeware\n\nSee ``python3.5 a2dp.py -h``.\n\nShorthands:\n\n    $ alias speakers=\"a2dp.py 10:08:C1:44:AE:BC\"\n    $ alias headphones=\"a2dp.py 00:22:37:3D:DA:50\"\n    $ alias headset=\"a2dp.py 00:22:37:F8:A0:77 -p hsp\"\n\n    $ speakers\n\n\n\nCheck here for the latest updates: https://gist.github.com/pylover/d68be364adac5f946887b85e6ed6e7ae\n\nThanks to:\n\n * https://github.com/DominicWatson, for adding the ``-p/--profile`` argument.\n * https://github.com/IzzySoft, for mentioning wait before connecting again.\n * https://github.com/AmploDev, for v0.4.0\n\nChange Log\n----------\n\n- 0.4.1\n  * Sorting device list\n\n- 0.4.0\n  * Adding ignore_fail argument by @AmploDev.\n  * Sending all available streams into selected sink, after successfull connection by @AmploDev.\n\n- 0.3.3\n  * Updating default sink before turning to ``off`` profile.\n\n- 0.3.2\n  * Waiting a bit: ``-w/--wait`` before connecting again.\n\n- 0.3.0\n  * Adding -p / --profile option for using the same script to switch between headset and A2DP audio profiles\n\n- 0.2.5\n  * Mentioning [mac] argument.\n\n- 0.2.4\n  * Removing duplicated devices in select device list.\n\n- 0.2.3\n  * Matching ANSI escape characters.

Is there a a way to make it work like this:\n80x24 Terminal in top-right corner => Click full screen => full screen Terminal => Click full screen again => 80x24 Terminal in top-right corner\n\nA: This is definitely an issue with Unity and the GNOME Terminal. I tried to recreate this issue with 4 other versions of Ubuntu (though I don't think any were using GNOME terminal) and it only does this with Unity.\nThis isn't really a fix for the issue but I can tell you that I installed the xfce4-terminal and tried it. It came out of fullscreen as a standard size window not maximized. \nNot an answer but a workaround.  If this is what you would like and it works for you, you can change your default so that when you use the shortcut CTRL + ALT + T it will launch xfce4-terminal rather than GNOME terminal you can use the following:\nsudo update-alternatives --config x-terminal-emulator\n\nand choose the /usr/bin/xfce4-terminal.wrapper \nThat will change your default terminal to the xfce one.\n\nA: My system did an unattended-upgrade and now it works.\n", "Q: How to block input to webcam? When I was running Windows 7 on my Lenovo machine there was a pre-installed Lenovo utility which would make it so that anyone trying to see what my webcam sees would instead see a still image of a camera with a cross over it. And thus preventing applications and hackers without root privileges from seeing out of my webcam. I say root privileges because root privileges were required in order to change the settings of the program in order to allow programs to actually use my webcam and get what it sees rather than the still image.\nThis was a very useful utility for privacy and security reasons, however on Ubuntu I have been unable to find a similar utility which has the ability to do the same. Is there such a utility or is there any way of achieving what I have described?\nI am running Ubuntu GNOME 16.04 with GNOME 3.20.\n\nA: A foolproof way to block webcam input\n\nPicture provided by Darkreading.com\n\nA: Disable the webcam kernel module:\nmodprobe -r uvcvideo\n\nuvcvideo is the most common module name. If not found, check lsmod | grep uvcv and you'll get the module name.\nThis will disable it for this session.\nTo make it permanent, add blacklist + module name to /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf. (Like blacklist uvcvideo)\n\nA: Another foolproof solution that wouldn't work for everyone:\nOpen the laptop up, and unplug the webcam.  Use an external webcam instead, pluggin it in only as required.  I actually did this in the opposite order as the internal webcam was poor quality and I didn't want it on the same angle as the screen.\n", "Q: Bluetooth status: inactive (dead) When I try to activate usb on my laptop, I can't see my device.

Its most convenient and fast (since compression is included). \nFor example, from the local computer on the terminal use,\nrsync -avz /path/to/local/50GBfolder -e ssh username@address:/home/user \nNext, connect to server using ssh and from there copy folder to the owncloud data directory. (Two step are needed since you need root permission to copy to owncloud data directory which is owned by www-data user.)\nCopy files this way;\nsudo cp -r /home/user/50Gbfolder /path/to/data/$owncloud_username/files/\n\n\n*\n\n*Inside the data directory, there is a folder for each owncloud user as owncloud_username, then under that there is a folder as files; hence mentioned above in the command.\n\n\nLastly, update owncloud database  by scanning to identify the new files.\nThis is done by prebuilt command. First, change directory to your owncloud installation directory. For default this is \\var\\www\\owncloud.\nso,\ncd \\var\\www\\owncloud\nIf you do ls, you will see an executable as occ under this folder. This occ is a php based program.\nTo run occ for rescan,\nsudo -u www-data php occ files:scan $user_name\nFull rescan may take some time. After the rescan, you will see the folder when logged in from a browser.\n\nExplanation:\n\n\n*\n\n*rsync -avz /path/to/local/50GBfolder -e ssh username@address:/home/user\n-a includes recursive, permissions, links, group etc and much more. Check man-page. -v verbose, -z compress and transfer.\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo cp -r /home/user/50Gbfolder /path/to/data/$owncloud_username/files/\n-r recursive folder copy, all subfolders are copied.\n\nA: There are two problems with your scp command:\n\n\n*\n\n*You are trying to upload a directory, hence you must provide the -r option (copy recursively).\n\n*The environment variables are substituted before the execution of the command. Therefore, $HOME in masi@192.168.1.101:$HOME/ expands to the path of your home directory on your local (rather than the remote) machine. If the home directory paths on the two machines are different then the command will work not as you intended, most probably failing because of access problems. When using scp, refer to your home directory on the remote machine with '.' (in other words scp interprets paths on the remote machine relative to your home directory).\nSo the correct command will be:\nscp -r $HOME/5GBdata/ masi@192.168.1.101:.\n\nHowever, note that this answer only points out your mistakes in using scp. Refer to the other answer(s) for recommendations on how to achieve your final goal.\n", "Q: How do I undo an action in Vim?

You can use the undo and redo commands above \nto revert the text to how it was before each change.  You can also apply the \nchanges again, getting back the text before the undo.\n\nThe \"U\" command is treated by undo/redo just like any other command.  Thus a\n\"u\" command undoes a \"U\" command and a 'CTRL-R' command redoes it again.  When\nmixing \"U\", \"u\" and 'CTRL-R' you will notice that the \"U\" command will\nrestore the situation of a line to before the previous \"U\" command.  This may\nbe confusing.  Try it out to get used to it.\nThe \"U\" command will always mark the buffer as changed.  When \"U\" changes the\nbuffer back to how it was without changes, it is still considered changed.\nUse \"u\" to undo changes until the buffer becomes unchanged.\n\n==============================================================================\n2. Two ways of undo                                     *undo-two-ways*\n\nHow undo and redo commands work depends on the 'u' flag in 'cpoptions'.\nThere is the Vim way ('u' excluded) and the Vi-compatible way ('u' included).\nIn the Vim way, \"uu\" undoes two changes.  In the Vi-compatible way, \"uu\" does\nnothing (undoes an undo).\n\n'u' excluded, the Vim way:\nYou can go back in time with the undo command.  You can then go forward again\nwith the redo command.  If you make a new change after the undo command,\nthe redo will not be possible anymore.\n\n'u' included, the Vi-compatible way:\nThe undo command undoes the previous change, and also the previous undo command.\nThe redo command repeats the previous undo command.  It does NOT repeat a\nchange command, use \".\" for that.\n\nExamples        Vim way                 Vi-compatible way       ~\n\"uu\"            two times undo          no-op\n\"u CTRL-R\"      no-op                   two times undo\n\nRationale:  Nvi uses the \".\" command instead of CTRL-R.  Unfortunately, this\n            is not Vi compatible.  For example \"dwdwu.\" in Vi deletes two\n            words, in Nvi it does nothing.\n\n==============================================================================\n3. Undo blocks                                          *undo-blocks*\n\nOne undo command normally undoes a typed command, no matter how many changes\nthat command makes.  This sequence of undo-able changes forms an undo block.\nThus if the typed key(s) call a function, all the commands in the function are\nundone together.\n\nIf you want to write a function or script that doesn't create a new undoable\nchange but joins in with the previous change use this command:\n\n                                                *:undoj* *:undojoin* *E790*\n:undoj[oin]             Join further changes with the previous undo block.\n                        Warning: Use with care, it may prevent the user from\n                        properly undoing changes.  Don't use this after undo\n                        or redo.\n                        {not in Vi}\n\nThis is most useful when you need to prompt the user halfway through a change.\nFor example in a function that calls |getchar()|.  Do make sure that there was\na related change before this that you must join with.\n\nThis doesn't work by itself, because the next key press will start a new\nchange again.  But you can do something like this: >\n\n        :undojoin | delete\nAfter this an \"u\" command will undo the delete command and the previous\nchange.\n\nTo do the opposite, break a change into two undo blocks, in Insert mode use\nCTRL-G u.  This is useful if you want an insert command to be undoable in\nparts.  E.g., for each sentence.  |i_CTRL-G_u|\nSetting the value of 'undolevels' also breaks undo.  Even when the new value\nis equal to the old value.\n\nRest you can find when you do :help undo in vim.\n", "Q: Better to suspend my ubuntu or shut down it during long journey in car? I will be in a 4hr car drive, but I still have a lot of unfinished editing jobs that I don't want to close in Ubuntu, because I will have to take notes of what is left for each job so that I can resume it.\nshall I suspend Ubuntu, or shut it down, for data and laptop safety during the long car drive?\nThanks.\n\nA: Maybe shut down and take a nap. Suspend will still keep some software in RAM memory, thus eating some battery. Probably not much, but enough to make a difference in some situations.

This seems to happen when the application ' Nautilus ( icon name is “Files” ) ' is simultaneously open in multiple permission states. When Nautilus (Files) is launched using the Unity launcher, the control level is that of a “ user “. When Nautilus (Files) is started from the terminal (CLI) using sudo, it is opened with all the permissions of “ root “. In addition to changing the permission of a folder located on the desktop, Ubuntu will also change the permission of the file that retains the desktop configuration information.\n    Unfortunately this does not happen on a regular basis so it is difficult to confirm this theory.\n", "Q: Dual Booting with linux & windows, cannot boot to windows I installed Linux on a Windows machine. I make music, so I use live 9, which is not for Linux, MAKE IT FOR LINUX! \nI wanted to boot to Linux, but well Linux gimp or boot select is fine, but I made it like that, when windows will boot, it's boot will automatically redirect to Linux. \nSo, what happens (behind the scenes): \n\n\n*\n\n*Windows boot manager automatically redirects to Linux \n\n*Linux will give me a selection between Ubuntu, memory-test, memory-test 2 and Windows 10.\n\n*When I select Windows 10, it will return me to same spot (machine boots to Windows, but then again windows boot manager redirects to Linux). \n\n\nSo I need to boot to windows to change it to normal or to change something with files (via Linux) well, I am on my own with file change and copys from other machines boot stuff is pretty much same and with booting to Windows. \nI need to get it not redirect me to Ubuntu, I think maybe an USB ISO will work, but I am not sure. \nIf it works I will add it to this as answer and close this topic. \nI know it takes time to answer, so I posted it already. \nHELP!

Windows won't load, so there must be something wrong with your Windows bootloader. You need to fix it to regain access to Windows. \n\n\n*\n\n*Use a Windows disc or live usb drive to initiate windows start-up repair. Remember that you should use the same one that is already installed on your computer. \n\n*You can see there is a system restore point. If there is one, you might be able to restore it. You can look for it after you boot using Windows disc or live usb. \n\n*The last option is to repair your bootloader using command prompt. You will need to run some commands after booting with a windows disc or live usb. This link has a step by step guide on using the commands. It's a bit advanced so I suggest you exercise caution and read thoroughly before trying it. \n\n\nHope this helps. \n", "Q: Revert iptables I created the following temporary rule that I enable occasionally but I would like to remove it without the need of restarting the machine.\nCan someone provide me the command?\nsudo iptables -t nat -I PREROUTING -i eno1 -p TCP -d 149.202.80.48/32 --dport 2020 -j DNAT --to-destination 10.167.147.211:2020\n\n\nA: I would recommend that you save your existing rules before making your adjustment, and then restoring those rules once you're done using the special rule.\n\n\n*\n\n*iptables-save > /etc/iptables.rules\n\n*iptables -t nat -I PREROUTING -i eno1 -p TCP -d 149.202.80.48/32 --dport 2020 -j DNAT --to-destination 10.167.147.211:2020\n\n*Do your thing.\n\n*iptables --flush\n\n*iptables-restore < /etc/iptables.rules\nThis would be especially useful if you have other iptables rules (such as those from fail2ban, etc).\n\nAnother option is to save your iptables to a file as described above, except instead of manually flushing and restoring, you could set up /etc/network/if-pre-up.d/ to restore, and have /etc/network/if-post-down.d/ flush.

There were no problems on that machine.\n\nA: in the your /etc/X11/xorg.conf in any of the Display, Screen, Monitor, Device sections you can specify the HW or SW cursor options to control how the display of the cursor is managed.  Try either of these to prevent the cursor being hidden.\nOption \"HWcursor\"\nFor chipsets that support hardware cursors, this option enforces their use, even for cases that are known to cause problems on some machines. Note that it is overridden by the \"SWcursor\" option. Hardware cursors effectively speeds all graphics operations as the job of ensuring that the cursor remains on top is now given to the hardware. It also reduces the effect of cursor flashing during graphics operations.\nOption \"SWcursor\"\nThis disables use of the hardware cursor provided by the chip. Try this if the cursor seems to have problems.\n\nA: I faced something similar which I worked through on the Ubuntu Forums at thread\nLong story short after trying Amias answer, creating an empty /etc/X11/xorg.conf file seemed to do the trick though I am now getting system errors on start up.\n\nA: I don't know if this is still a problem.\nI found a video on YouTube a while ago about this, and I had the same problem when I switched to Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. The solution oddly enough was to go into Gimp and under the input devices you have to change a setting. It worked for me. No error messages or anything.\nNo cursor was visible when I set up my tablet but I could box select items, so input was being emulated just no cursor, and pen click behaved like right mouse click. I did the Gimp input devices change and my cursor appeared and pressure sensitivity began working.\n\nA: This can still be a problem. I had this same problem and the solution was to include MatchUSBID input in the xorg config file. I answered this here. Hope it will help someone. Bottom line: Follow the current instructions given in DIGImend repository completely.\n", "Q: KDE Plasma doesn't recognize keyboard shortcuts, until I switch away from and back to KWin I just made a jump from Maté to KDE Plasma. (Kubuntu v. 14.04.4) (I love everything else about it.) I'm hardly a linux beginner, but I don't usually mess with X and some help is appreciated.\nWhen I first start my machine, everything runs smoothly, but standard keyboard shortcuts (like ALT+TAB and CTRL+ALT+RIGHT) are not recognized. Every window does accept keyboard input; just not the window manager.\nFor the moment, I can fix this by switching from KWin to Compiz, and then back; after that, everything works fine and I can get on with my work. However, it's something I would like to find a permanent solution to, if I can.\nThanks for any tips and pointers anyone has to offer on this.\n\nA: Figured it out.\nI was using Maté before; and Compiz was my preferred window manager. So, I had it set up to run \"compiz --replace\" on startup. KDE doesn't need it, of course; and when it ran, it hijacked keyboard shortcuts.\nNow that I've disabled it, everything's running smoothly.\n", "Q: virt-manager process continues running after closing all of its windows, what should I do? I have installed qemu, kvm, and virt-manager, though I have noticed that after closing all of the virt-manager windows that there is still a virt-manager process running which originally appeared to be transitioning between the two states of Running and Sleeping very quickly and all of the time, but now it seems to have quietened down a bit though (it is now mostly on Running but from time to time changes to Sleeping for a few seconds) it is using over 150 MiB of RAM, but no CPU.\nI am running Ubuntu GNOME 16.04 with GNOME 3.20, is it safe for me to end the process or is there some reason for it still to be running? Or a proper way for me to exit it rather than just closing all of its windows?\n\nA: The reason the process continues running is because when you close all of its windows it actually just minimizes to the tray, or at least, it carries on running until you have closed it using the Quit option either by choosing that for the option from the tray, or from File > Quit in one of the windows:\n\n\nAs you probably will have also noticed from the last screenshot, you can also close it completely with the keyboard shortcut CTRL + Q (though of course not when you're in a Virtual Session, otherwise the keyboard shortcut will just go to the VM rather than to virt-manager, or at least, virt-manager will think you're talking to the VM and give it to the VM rather than act upon the instructions itself.\nSo quitting the program in these ways should also get rid of the process so no need to end it manually (and probably a bad idea to just in case).\n", "Q: Wrong number of cpus in system monitor I am running Ubuntu 16.04.

I have a very nice new laptop now which I don't want to try to risk redownloading Ubuntu on. It has a 128GB SSD which Windows 10 is installed on (and I would like to keep) and a 1TB Hard Drive. I was wondering if I should buy an external hard drive, and put Ubuntu as it's sole OS. Then anytime I need Linux I can just boot from that. Is that possible and does it bring any risk to my files on my computers current SSD and Hard Drive? I will not be needing any of my current files when I am using Linux, I can redownload the things I need to the external drive. I need Linux for some programming classes I am taking so I can easily re-install the things I need. Any help is very appreciated, thank you for your time.\n\nA: To run Ubuntu from a USB port, be it a Flash Drive or an External HDD/SSD you first need to download Ubuntu in your preferred flavour and write the ISO to the drive. In Windows there are many tools to convert ISO to USB bootable, but the best one is Rufus. The official guide including links to Ubuntu is here: How to create a bootable USB stick on Windows.\nRegarding safety and the access of your files between operating systems. You should be careful about transferring from Ubuntu to Windows without a virus/malware check, as Linux distros often don't have virus checking software for numerous reasons, such as how the OS is sectioned and isolated into built for purpose 'jails'. A transfer could potentially be a risk for software being let loose on Windows without any fail safe.\nI do recommend getting a recovery drive for Windows 10, see official instructions here: Creating a recovery drive. Hence, if you do decide to go for dual boot, which is simply making sure you install in the correct boot mode: UEFI or Legacy and having a separate, big enough partition in a EXT format.\nTo be sure, the quickest way to switch between OS's is via virtual media drives. I recommend VM Player and another option with more options in free mode is VBox. You can create your own 'jail' for the OS as well by limiting copy/paste and shared folders to your root OS.\n", "Q: Is there a software to control my wireless router? I was a windows user and was controlling my router using selfishnet and now I'm using Ubuntu 16.04 , \nI wonder if there is a similar software or any other way to do it.\n\nA: Many wireless routers can be controlled from your browser. When you are connected to your router, try each of the following IP's. They are all local IPs, and it depends on how your network is setup that determines which one will work.\n\n\n*\n\n*http://10.0.0.1/\n\n*http://192.168.1.1/\n\n*http://192.168.0.1/\nIf these do not work, find your local IP address using the following command:\nifconfig | grep \"inet addr\" | grep -v 127.0.0.1\n\nMy output is like this:\ninet addr:10.0.0.9  Bcast:10.0.0.255  Mask:255.255.255.0\n\nChange the last set of four digits after the inet addr: to a 1, and put that in your browser.\nMy local IP is 10.0.0.9, so my router would be at 10.0.0.1 (most likely).\nIf none of these work, your router may not support configuration over a web browser.\n\nA: you can install Net Line Dancer most network developer use it you can \n\n\n*\n\n*Copy the installer (netLD-2013.08.0-x86_64.bin) on the target server.\n\n*Run chmod +x netLD-2013.08.0-x86_64.bin and change permission of the installer copied.\n\n*Run sudo ./ netLD-2013.08.0-x86_64.bin and execute installation.\n\n*When Is this ok [y/N]: is displayed, enter y and proceed next step.\n\n*Create SSL certificate.

I searched online for answers and read somewhere that deselecting the 'sync with internet clock' might help the issue. It did seem to resolve the issue for the short-term, but after some updates I have noticed once again that my system clock is 7 hours ahead. Looking into the BIOS I discovered that the clock there was being reset. \nWhat brought it to my attention was that my f.Lux in UBuntu wasn't turning on at the right times, so I went and checked the time in BIOS and noticed that it was forward by 7 hours. This explains a few things, ans I suspected its probably the battery, BUT something weird is happening that tells me otherwise.   \nIf I go into BIOS and set the clock to the correct time, and then load into Windows, everything stays fine. I can restart the system into Windows and nothing changes in the BIOS or Windows time. If I log into Ubuntu via the Windows bootloader the time changes in the Ubuntu Clock to be behind 7 hours. If I reboot again into Ubuntu the Ubuntu clock is still off and the BIOS clock is normal. The only time the clock chnage sin the bIOS is when I change the time in UBuntu clock, (either by selecting manaul or internet sync).  \nWhat is strange is that after the BIOS is modified to have the wrong time, the clock in Ubuntu will seem correct by displaying the right time. If I fix the time in the BIOS, log straight Into ubuntu wia windows bootloader, the Ubuntu clock will be off.  \nIts almost as though Ubuntu cant read the BIOS clock properly or sync with it. \nRunning Windows7 64 bit alongside Ubuntu 14.04 64 bit\n\nA: Found the solution! I read HERE that:\n\"Operating systems store and retrieve the time in the hardware clock located on your motherboard so that it can keep track of the time even when the system does not have power. Most operating systems (Linux/Unix/Mac) store the time on the hardware clock as UTC by default, though some systems (notably Microsoft Windows) store the time on the hardware clock as the 'local' time. This causes problems in a dual boot system if both systems view the hardware clock differently\"\nThe steps to resolve this issue by making Linux use 'Local' time were to:\ngksudo gedit /etc/default/rcS\nadd or change the following section \n# Set UTC=yes if your hardware clock is set to UTC (GMT)\nUTC=no\n\nA: My understanding may be outdated, but last time I checked Linux assumes that the BIOS clock is in UTC (by default), while Windows assumes it's set to your local time.\nIf you would like to tell Ubuntu to use local time, which may fix your issues after booting Windows, you will need to edit /etc/default/rcS:\n# Set UTC=yes if your hardware clock is set to UTC (GMT)\nUTC=no\n\nThe alternative is telling Windows that your hardware clock is in UTC, but I'm not familiar with how you'd go about this.\nYou may find additional information by reading about this similar question.\n", "Q: can't install ubuntu-software on 16.04 I did a clean install of 16.04.

Below is the result:\n\n\nA: I kind of hate to tell you this, since you've done so much work and all, but that's a Launchpad page and it has a PPA. A PPA is sort of an index of packages Ubuntu can use to download and install what is requested. If you add that PPA, you can just install parcel-tracker with a simple command in the terminal.\nRun the below commands to install parcel-tracker:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:torkvemada/torkvemada\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install parcel-tracker\n\nConfirm any prompts you get.\nI think that's it. The package does have a version for Ubuntu 16.04, so I don't think you'll run into any errors.\n\nA: As an oversimplification, the configure script and make have been typically shipped with C/C++ or Fortan source code .  configure scripts are generally used to setup compile options and ensure that dependencies are present.  automake is typically used to compile the code and install the binaries in system locations.\nhence, if you download source code for an application and the developer uses configure and make to build the application, then you will need to do the same.  sometimes, applications are distributed as binaries (precompiled).  those won't ship with configure and make.  also, java applications typically don't use configure and make.  so it depends on the build tools that the developer chose when they wrote the application.\n\nA: Execute\nautoreconf -vfi\n\ninside your extracted source root directory. This will generate a configure file specific to your system, that you can execute afterwards. Make sure it is executable for you, e. g.:\nchmod u+x configure\n\nthen\n./configure\n\nshould work.\n\nA: Not all tar archives have ./configure files. I wanted to install Eclipse a while ago and it doesn't have one. I instead ran an alternate windows version through wine (though this is not preferable, it worked).

This machine is also running a Minecraft server. I set up my domain(example.com) host \"A\" type record with my WAN IP and I have port forwarded port 80 and 443 for my web server and 25565 for my Minecraft server using the LAN IP of my server. Here's my dilemma, I can access my Minecraft server using the domain (suggesting I set up the host records properly) but I can not access my test site from the outside world. \nI know that my WAN IP is dynamic but only changes at the earliest on a monthly basis. So I'll deal with Dynamic DNS at a later time.\nThe funny thing is, when I enter my domain while connected to my home network everything works but this could be because of the way Virtual Hosts work with the server but I'm not sure. \nMy question is, can anyone provide some insight or suggestions on what to do to be able to view my test site running from my home server using my domain?\n\nA: Does your browser report \"Connection Timed Out\" when you try to connect to port 80 or 443?\nIf it does, it's most likely because your ISP blocks incoming connections to those ports for \"security reasons\" (though most ISPs just don't want consumers running web servers without special plans). \nThere's no way of getting around this short of changing ports. Luckily for you, the secondary ports for HTTP and HTTPS usually aren't blocked by ISPs, and are accepted by modern browsers in terms of security. The secondary ports are 8080 for HTTP and 8443 for HTTPS. Change those ports and you should be able to connect.\nOn a slightly off-topic note, if you need a server manager for your Minecraft server, PufferPanel is free and works rather well. I use it myself and find it's very handy for managing my MC servers remotely. It does take some setup, but the setup is well documented and isn't too difficult.\n", "Q: bq m10 keyboard layout How to switch to the Russian keyboard layout an external keyboard in desktop mode?

I have seen the Bumblebee project briefly, does this attempt this? Are the future drivers in ppa:graphics-drivers/ppa going in this direction?\nThanks!\n\nA: If I understand correctly, this's a problem with X server. There are no means of switching between devices while the X server is running.\nBumblebee used 2 instances of X server being used in the same time and switch buffers between them. This attempt was just a workaround of the problem and it suffers from excessive overhead.\n\nA: bumblebee will allow you to start specific applications with the nvidia card providing the graphics acceleration for that application only.  all other applications continue using the Intel GPU.  it's not dynamic switching but it's better than nothing.\nyou invoke an application as follows:\nprimusrun application\n\n", "Q: For some reason, I can't modify contents in USB drives For some reason, only root can modify the contents in USB drives (create folder/file, etc.), after running related commands.\n\nA: I mistakenly edited the permissions, or some command did.\nI ran sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /media/$USER (replace $USER with your username).\n", "Q: Installing Huion tablet I'm not sure how to install my Huion H610 Pro tablet.

I'm running out of search keywords for this problem. Honestly i'm not sure what to even call it.\nIf the cursor is over a clickable object, i can move the cursor a fair good distance, and when i lift my finger it clicks the link.

I have millions of images on my ubuntu cloud server. When I move a complete folder containing 12 million images using mv command, it happens almost instantaneously. However, when I mv only images(not the folder) then it takes some time. Is there a way to move all the images as quickly as folders ? \nThis is what is happening:\n\n\n*\n\n*src folder has 12 million images and I move this to dst folder using\n$ mv  src ../dst\n\nHappens immediately  \n\n*Inside src folder I do this to move:  \nfind -maxdepth 1 -name '*.jpg' -exec mv -t ../../dst/ {} +\n\nThis takes some time. \nIs there a way to speed up the second process ?\n\nA: Your confusion comes from the file system abstraction which makes you believe that a folder contains files and other folders in a tree-like fashion. This is not actually true: all files and directories within a file system are located on the same level and identified with numbers of some sort, dependent on implementation. Directories are just special files which contain lists of other files.\nWhen you \"move\" files inside a file system, actual files don't go anywhere. Rather, lists inside directories are updated to reflect the change.\nmv src ../dst moves a single list entry from directory . to directory ../dst, so it's fast.\nfind -maxdepth 1 -name '*.jpg' -exec mv -t ../../dst/ has to move millions of entries, so it's slower. It may potentially be speeded up if you call mv only once and not once per file, and the mv command itself may be optimized to move several directory entries in one step, but there is no way to make it as fast as when you move a single directory.\n\nA: TL;DR: No\nFor a smaller amount of files, you would not need find but, even in this simplified and smaller case, if you just \nmv *.jpg ../../dst/\n\nit will take more time than moving the whole directory at once.\n\nWhy? The point is to understand what mv does.\nBriefly speaking, mv moves a number (that identifies a directory, or a file) from an inode (the directory containing it) to another one, and these indices are updated in the journal of the file system or in the FAT (if the file system is implemented in such a way).\nIf source and destination are on the same file system, there is no actual movement of data, it just changes the position, the point where they are attached to.\nSo, when you mv one directory, you are doing this operation one time.\nBut when you move 1 million files, you are doing this operation 1 million times.\nTo give you a practical example, you have a tree with a many branches. In particular, there is one node to which 1 million branches are attached.\nTo cut down these branches and move them somewhere else, you can either cut each one of them, so you make 1 million cuts, or you cut just before the node, thus making just one cut (this is the difference between moving the files and the directory).\n\nA: A Simplified answer\nmoving a file is done is 3 steps:      \n\n\n*\n\n*add() a link to the file to the inode list of the destination folder  \n\n*check if the link was successfully added  \n\n*remove() the link from the list of inodes of source folder if the check above was a success.  \n\n\nthis process is the same for a file or a folder.\nand obviously doing this for 1 file is 100 faster than doing it for 100 files.\nman link   is the add()\nman unlink is the remove()\nmv just uses those two commands above and adds a check in-between to prevent data loss.\n\nA: It will still be slow because, as noted, the file system has to relink each file name to its new location.\nHowever, you can speed it up from what you have now.\nYour find command runs the exec once for each file. So it launches the mv command 12 million times for 12 million files. This can be improved in two ways.\n\n\n*\n\n*Add a plus to the end:\nfind -maxdepth 1 -name '*.jpg' -exec mv -t ../../dst/ +\nCheck the man-page to make sure it's supported in your version of find. The effect should be to run a series of mv commands with as many filenames as will fit on each command-line.\n\n*Use find and xargs together.\nfind -maxdepth 1 -name '*.jpg' -print0 | xargs -0 mv -t ../../dst/\nThe -print0 will use NUL, aka zero bytes to separate the file names. This plus xargs -0 fixes any problems xargs would otherwise have with spaces in file names. The xargs command will read the list of file names from the find command and run the mv command on as many file names as will fit.\n", "Q: How do I recover my Data?

This only changed the size of the filesystem, but not the partition. You'll need to delete the partition and recreate it with the correct size, using the fdisk command:\n$ fdisk /dev/sdb\n\nYou can type p to see the partition table:\nDevice     Boot Start      End  Sectors Size Id Type\n/dev/sdb1  *     2048 52428766 52426719  25G 83 Linux\n\nType d to delete the partition. Then n to add a new partition, use the same values as the original one but changing the last sector to the one that fits the current filesystem. It accepts a relative size for the last sector, so calculate the resulting size by multiplying the number of blocks with the block length that gave the resize2fs command. In this example:\n6291456 * 4k = 25165824k\nWhen adding the new partition and you get asked for the last sector, type the resulting size (note the + prefix and the uppercase K): +25165824K\nType a if the partition was a bootable one, and p to view the new partition table:\nDevice     Boot    Start      End  Sectors  Size Id Type\n/dev/sdb1  *        2048 50333695 50331648   24G 83 Linux\n\nType w to write changes to disk.

In this attack I need to edit the ip_forward file. \nThis attack works successfully, but I want to know why do I need to change /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward to 1.\n\nA: SSLstrip works as man in the middle, which in itself somewhat explains why you need to enable packet forwarding.\nYour 'server' sits in between the client and the intended destination.  As the client browses, the traffic is processed and modified by you, and then sent on to the destination.  If you don't enable packet forwarding, the data would stop at your server, and the client would appear like it wasn't connected to the internet.\nBy default packet forwarding is off in Ubuntu, so by setting it to 1, you are enabling it.  So, your title doesn't make a ton of sense.\n", "Q: Remmina not launching 16.04 I have just installed Ubuntu 16.04 64 bit. When I try to launch Remmina Remote desktop nothing happens.

Directly to the point, I want to give the user the flexibility to pass arguments to a command in order to control how the commands should run, something like:\npcap -d 30 -w 2\n\nIn other words:\nI want to make a command that looks exactly like Linux commands. A command that works exactly as Linux commands. A command that has options (i.e.: arguments) in the same style as Linux commands. \nI want to create a command that works by taking arguments from the user or by using its default arguments (read from a configuration file) in case no arguments are supplied by the user, exactly like any other Linux commands. \nA command with --help that shows the different options. \nI know how to make a command in Linux. But I don't know how to make these options (command arguments). I don't know how these arguments are programmed. \na guide, a tutorial or an example will do\nNote:\n\n\n*\n\n*Apologies if this question is asked in the wrong stack. \n\n*Also apologies for the previous version of the question, it was badly phrased.\n\n\nA: Since you mention python, a python answer:\nif you simply want to set a default value for an argument, you can simply set the default for the function:\ndef show(val = 30):\n    print(val)\n# to print the default value (30)\nshow()\n# to show another value (e.g. 40)\nshow(40)\n\nIn other words, this will print the default value if you give no argument, while it uses the argument if you give it.\nMore advanced; reading the default values from a file, with the option to overrule by giving the arguments\nThe very same can be done, but reading default arguments from a file. This will give the opportunity to set arguments in a settings file instead of editing them in the code itself.\nLet's say I have a settings file, testconf.txt:\nlength:4\nheight:7\nwidth:6\n\n...and I want to read these values into my application as default arguments, but the user can overrule them by custom arguments:\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport sys\n\n# path to my config file\nconf_file = \"/home/jacob/Bureaublad/testconf.txt\"\n# read the default arguments from a file\ndef_args = [l.strip() for l in open(conf_file).readlines()]\n# replace default args by possible custom args\ncust_args = sys.argv[1:]\nfor cu in cust_args:\n    argname = cu.split(\":\")[0]\n    try:\n        match = [arg for arg in def_args if arg.startswith(argname)][0]\n    except IndexError:\n        print(\"incorrect argument: \", cu)\n    else:\n        def_args[def_args.index(match)] = cu\n\ndef get_arg(s):\n    return [val.split(\":\")[1] for val in def_args if val.startswith(s)][0]\n\nl = get_arg(\"length\")\nw = get_arg(\"width\")\nh = get_arg(\"height\")\n\nprint(\"l=\", l, \"w=\", w, \"h=\", h)\n\nNow I can run the script without arguments:\n$ '/home/jacob/Bureaublad/pscript_4.py'\nl= 4 w= 6 h= 7\n\nOr width arguments:\n$ '/home/jacob/Bureaublad/pscript_4.py' length:10 height:456\nl= 10 w= 6 h= 456\n\nThe order of given arguments is in this setup irrelevant. In case of an incorrect argument:\n$ '/home/jacob/Bureaublad/pscript_4.py' monkey\nincorrect argument:  monkey\nl= 4 w= 6 h= 7\n\nNote\nIn \"real\" software, you can (and should) make it more advanced of course by adding a warning if the settings file is incorrect or missing, decide what to do then, but this is the basic idea.\n\nEDIT\nFrom your comments, I understand that in two ways, the above answer is not (yet) what you are looking for:\n\n\n*\n\n*You'd like to run the command without the path to the executable (script), and its extension, and \n\n*You'd like to have a more \"conventional\" format of the options.\n\n\nAlthough [1] is anwered elsewhere already, I'll include a brief explanation here:\n1. Run the command without path and extension\nYou can run executables and scripts without having to include the path to the script by making it executable (chmod +x <files>), and place them anywhere in $PATH.\nOn Linux, the extension (.py) does not play a role whatsoever, so you can use the script without extension anyway.\nTo be concrete: \n\n\n*\n\n*create, if it doesn't exist yet, the directory ~/bin\n\n*create and save the script, exactly as mentioned in the original answer, as showsize (no extenion) in ~/bin, and make the script executable.\nAfter a log out/in, you can simply run the script by the command:\nshowsize\n\n2. Change the format of the options\nAs mentioned, you can change the format of the options easily, e.g.: To parse out the options, given like:\n-l 23 -h 210 -w 321\n\n\n\n*\n\n*If you include in the script:\nargs = sys.argv[1:]\nThe result for argswill be a list:\n[\"-l\", \"23\", \"-h\", \"210\", \"-w\", \"321\"]\n\nNow what we need to do to get the value of -h, is simply look up the index of -h, and pick the first next item in the list:\nheight = args[args.index(\"-h\")+1]\nprint(height)\n\n> 210\n\nin a script:\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport sys\n\n# path to my config file\nconf_file = \"/home/jacob/Bureaublad/testconf.txt\"\n# read the default arguments from a file\ndef_args = [l.strip().split(\":\") for l in open(conf_file).readlines()]\n# replace default args by possible custom args\ncust_args = sys.argv[1:]\nfor carg in cust_args:\n    if carg in [\"-l\", \"-h\", \"-w\"]:                        \n        for d in def_args:\n            d[1] = cust_args[cust_args.index(carg)+1] if d[0] == carg else d[1]\n\ndef get_arg(s):\n    # fetch values from the list\n    return [val[1] for val in def_args if val[0] == s][0]\n\nl = get_arg(\"-l\")\nw = get_arg(\"-w\")\nh = get_arg(\"-h\")\n\nprint(\"length =\", l, \"\\nwidth =\", w, \"\\nheight =\", h)\n\nHow to use\n\n\n*\n\n*Create your settings file in the format:\n-l:4\n-h:7\n-w:6\n\n\n*Copy the script into an empty file, svae it as showsize (no extension) in ~/bin or anywhere else in $PATH, and make it executable.\n\n*In the head section of the script, set the path to the settings file:\n# path to my config file\nconf_file = \"/home/jacob/Bureaublad/testconf.txt\"\n\nNow run the command:\n$ showsize\nlength = 4 \nwidth = 6 \nheight = 7\n\nOr:\n$ showsize -l 300 -h 345 -w 751\nlength = 300 \nwidth = 751 \nheight = 345\n\n\nA: Script file:\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# set default values\nX=10\nY=\"lorem ipsum\"\n\nsource ~/.myscript.conf\n\necho \"X = $X, Y = $Y\"\n\n.myscript.conf file:\nX=20\nY=\"something else\"\n\nNow, if a user runs script file and does not have .myscript.conf file in his home directory, script will use X=10 and Y=\"lorem ipsum\", if there is config file, it will use values from the file.\nSource command executes contents of the file given as an argument in current shell, so here, it will assign new values to X and Y overwriting defaults from the script file.\nSince ~ points to user home directory this setup will work for any user on your system (also root).\n[Edit] And in your specific example:\n#!/bin/bash\nX=10\nY=2\nsource ~/.config.conf\npcap -d $X -w $Y\n\n\nA: Bash: same as Marek's with sourcing a file with user's values, with the caveat that this file can do anything, and typos will just elicit syntax errors, so this requires a bit of user know-how. You can parse command line parameters with getopts.\nPython: see the argparse module to parse command line parameters, and ConfigParser(v2) and configparser(v3) to parse a .ini file.\nTypically you use a config file for things that don't change often, and command line parameters for things that are likely different on each run. Editing a config file on each run is a PITA. \n", "Q: How can i install JCE?

So if you decide to reinstall R in the future, you you can simply run install.packages('packageName') from your R session.\n", "Q: Synapse doesn't work on 16.04 Synapse, installed from the official repo, crashes after typing anything:\nkhajvah@khajvah-work:~$ synapse\n[INFO 17:09:14.234703] [synapse-main:266] Starting up...\n[INFO 17:09:14.304390] [synapse-main:208] Binding activation to <Control>space\n[INFO 17:09:14.357984] [view-base:251] Screen is composited.\n[INFO 17:09:14.359002] [controller:57] Using xim input method.\n[WARN 17:09:14.417119] [desktop-file-service:343] Desktop session type is not recognized, assuming GNOME.\n[WARN 17:09:14.473902] [ssh-plugin:114] /home/khajvah/.ssh/config: Error opening file: No such file or directory\n[INFO 17:09:14.482539] [hybrid-search-plugin:179] keeps in cache now 366 file names\nSegmentation fault (core dumped)\n\nWorkaround\nThe version from ppa:synapse-core/testing works fine.\n\nA: It seems like there is a bug as many people having the issue including myself on Ubuntu MATE.

It froze for a minute but then it continued to the installation process. This is not the first time I have seen this happen. My guess is that when it freezes, it is trying to load the file for the setup.  \n\nA: I have a few possible solutions for you, in order of complexity:\n\n\n*\n\n*Try disabling Secure Boot. As discussed here: Installing Ubuntu Alongside a Pre-Installed Windows with UEFI, Secure Boot is supposed to work, but it doesn't always.\n\n*Try using a different USB or booting from a DVD. USB drives fail all the time, sometimes not catastrophically, but enough that booting isn't possible.\n\n*If you have another computer which can boot off of this USB drive, you could disable or remove the harddrives from that computer, put the harddrive you want to install Ubuntu on into this computer, and install that way.\n\n*If you have some other way to boot the computer you are working with, I have had good luck setting up a virtual machine with physical harddrive access (Be careful to not give it any mounted partitions! Keep backups!) and installing through the VM, even installing the bootloader! \n\n*Depending on how much effort you're willing to spend on this, and how advanced you are at using Ubuntu, you could try installing via PXE boot. This requires, that I can think of,\n\n\n*\n\n*Another computer to use as the PXE server\n\n*A DHCP server which supports passing the PXE server information\n\n*The computer to install on must support network booting\n\n\n\nA full guide is here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/PXEInstallServer. The details will vary depending on exactly how you set it up. Basically:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install needed packages: sudo apt-get install inetutils-inetd tftpd-hpa\n\n*Edit /etc/default/tftpd-hpa to have:\nRUN_DAEMON=\"yes\"\nOPTIONS=\"-l -s /var/lib/tftpboot\"\n\n*If you are using dhcpd for a DHCP server, add:\nfilename \"pxelinux.0\";\nnext-server <pxe host>;\nto your subnet declaration, replacing  with the ip address of the PXE server\n\n*Finally mount the iso:\nmount -o loop ubuntu.iso /var/lib/tftpboot\nConnect the computer you want to install on to your network with an ethernet connection and select network boot.

It's perfectly possible to install vlc without libdvdcss2 as is.\n", "Q: can pbuilder style hooks be used on launchpad builds I'm working on putting a project into PPA. The project is large and has lots of tests. A couple of tests require that some locales are installed. To get around this I've made a pbuilder hook that locale-gens the required locales. This works like a charm. The tests pass. If I don't do this pbuilder fails because the tests fail.\nSince I don't use the override_dh_auto_test target in debian/rules to skip the tests I presume that the launchpad build will fail because the tests will fail without the locales.\nIs there a way to install the locales on launchpad builds similar to hooks in pbuilder or should I just override the test target before dputting the packages to launchpad?\n\nA: You can't use pbuilder-style hooks, no.  However, generating locales doesn't require root in principle; it's just the default locale-gen arrangements that write to the system locale directories and therefore require root.  You could instead use localedef to generate the locales somewhere under your build directory and point your test process at that using LOCPATH.\n", "Q: Swap partition is not being used completely I have bulky Fortran source code (WRF) to be compiled.\nEvery time I compile the code, the system gets stuck. To diagnose the problem, I saw memory performance in the system monitor of Ubuntu, and compilation eats the whole RAM. Then it also starts eating swap memory. My laptop has 4 GB RAM. I extended it to 8 GB RAM. I created a swap partition of 12 GB. But once my swap partition utilization reaches 4 GB. system hangs. Why is my whole swap partition is not being used (see below)?\n\n\nA: Why would you want swap usage to be higher?\nReading/writing to the swap is 1000 times slower than reading/writing to the RAM.\nThe system may not be hanging, it's just that it's so busy swapping stuff back and forth, it appears as though it hung.\n@phihag said in the comments:\n\nMost likely, when swap reaches 4GB this happens to be around the time\n  that some part of the user interface gets swapped out. For instance,\n  that could be the code to handle Ctrl+C, the keyboard layout handler,\n  the code that displays output in the terminal, some data buffer of the\n  terminal, some data buffer of the X server which paints pictures, etc.\n  . Chances are if you wait a couple of hours either your swap is filled\n  up or all of the data and code necessary for the Ctrl+C to be handled\n  at the various layers has finally resulted in killing your Fortran\n  process\n\nI would suggest getting some more RAM. It will drastically speed up your compile. It's quite inexpensive nowadays, ~$60 for 16GB.\n\nA: Using too much swap is bad for your system. More swap means more lag. Android Dev has already pointed out why you don't really want to use more swap. However there is a way to configure how often your system will use the swap partition. It is controlled by a setting called swappiness. You will find a detailed guide about modifying swappiness in this link. \nI do not recommend you to increase swappiness. You can't even utilize a 12GB swap partition. The general rule is that swap should be half of your main memory. For you that is 2GB. \n", "Q: Floating point in CSH? I have been trying to run this script, but it gives the error \"badly formed number\"  due to the decimal 0.2224.\nIf I replace it with any integer, the script works fine.\n#!/bin/csh -f\n\nset shift=\"-1 2  \"\n\nforeach d ($shift)\n@ z = $d * \"0.2224\"\n\n awk -v k=$d 'FNR==3{$1+=4*k;}1' Lat | cat >>head\n awk -v k=$d '{$2+=k;}1' f1 | cat >>g1\n awk -v k=$d '{$2+=3*k;}1' f2 | cat >>g2\ncat head g1 g2 > POSCAR-$z\nrm head\nrm g1\nrm g2\n\n\nA: Shell variables are strings, not numbers. When you type 2 or \"0.2224\", it is seen as a string. The shell can handle some simple data conversion, so decimal expressions may work; but floating point values will not work.\nTo do math in the shell, you can pipe the values through bc and combine that with command substitution (the backtick wrappers around the command):\nset d = 2\nset result = `echo \"$d * 0.2224\" | bc`\necho $result\n\nThe syntax of this example is written for csh/tcsh, but the principle works in bash as well. If you need something more complicated than this, you may want to implement your script in python instead.\n\nA: The statement \" set shift=\"-1 2  \" \" causes this error \"badly formed number\". In csh scripts there should be space between operational characters and variables or number. So it should be \" set shift = \"-1 2\".\n", "Q: Virtual Machine Manager missing \"Allocate Entire Drive Now\" check-box when creating new VM In Unity 16.04, when creating a new VM, the option for Allocate Entire Drive Now is missing, meaning that when creating a new machine, the entire drive is allocated, i.e. waisted physical drive space.

Although It is so, I like to stay with opensource driver, But I want keep it up-to date to get better video driver performance. \nSo where can I find the latest opensource driver and how to install it?\n\nA: Most of the open source Radeon driver is part of the Linux kernel, so you need to update that in order to get the latest version. On Ubuntu, you can use the the update manager to do so, although the Ubuntu repositories will not always have the latest version, so you will need to add an additional repository. If you want the very latest version, you'll need to download the tarball from kernel.org and compiling it yourself. (Not adviseable for newbies IMO !)\nYou should also update the xserver-xorg-video-ati and xserver-xorg-video-radeon packages, and possibly others.\nBeware that:\n\n\n*\n\n*Doing this can make your system unstable, since such kernel and other updates are not supported, and compiling your own kernel even more so.\n\n*Depending on your hardware and / or Ubuntu version, may not give you much, if any, performance improvents, since the drivers are already pretty optimized.\n", "Q: Apache mod_ssl to use OpenSSL ENGINE on Ubuntu 14.04 I have installed OpenSSL 1.0.1f and created an Engine for RSA acceleration using GPU.

How can I remove one of them? I've seen a lot of answers to related questions, but they all deal with how to install from a startup disk or something like that, and wipe the hard drive. I want to keep one installation of Ubuntu, and remove the other.\n\nA: So, you have Ubuntu A and Ubuntu B. Let's say you boot up in Ubuntu A that you want to keep. \nOpen GParted, unmount partition with Ubuntu B then select swap partition of Ubuntu B (if any), right-click on it and choose swapoff. Swapoff is important, so don't miss it. Select partition with Ubuntu B and delete that partition. Apply changes.  \nOpen a Terminal window and type: \nsudo update-grub  \n\nClose Terminal and reboot. After restart, only one Ubuntu (ex-A) should appear in the boot menu.\n\nA: You can use GParted to format the partition and then run an upgrade grub command to update bootloader that the partition no longer has an OS.\n\nA: If the two installation are on separate partitions and don't have any common mount points like /home or /bin,  you can pretty much safely format the unwanted partition and generate new grub menu entries.\n", "Q: Why does lsusb return my Motorola Razr D3 as \"HTC (High Tech Computer Corp.)\"?

My professor has asked me to find a way to install Ubuntu the computers at a lab that already has windows 10 installed.

One pitfall is they would need to be already loaded into one OS or the other for remote users to have any control.

What do I write instead of connection_name? I don't know where to find it.\nnmcli connection up\n\nIf this is a whole command, do I && between them?\n\nA: Yes, \"nmcli\" is a command.  It's a shortened version of NetworkManager command-line interface.  You can find it by using the \"which\" command, like this (but it should already be in your PATH)\n[jcall@laptop ~]$ which nmcli\n/usr/bin/nmcli\n\nThe 'connection name' will be something you created previously.  Your connections could be created from the command-line, but I usually just use the GUI to create them (especially wireless connections.)  You can list your connections with the command \"nmcli connection show\" or the abbreviated way \"nmcli c s\"  Here is an example of my connections...\n[jcall@laptop ~]$ nmcli connection show\nNAME              UUID                                  TYPE             DEVICE \nHome_WiFi         c1c95bd9-78f3-4764-9922-971339702735  802-11-wireless  --     \nHotel_WiFi        921ad0bf-e18e-4d90-87d9-0f1c852c3dc7  802-11-wireless  --     \nGoogle Starbucks  d5242485-ebd6-4152-a839-eaedacc49b4a  802-11-wireless  --     \nenp0s25           6c6036d5-4739-3540-ac21-bf7a04669ed6  802-3-ethernet   --     \n\nFinally, you need to execute the commands in order, one after the other.  You could use && to do that, if you want to create a long single-line command.  I usually just create a small script file to make things easier.  Here is my example.\n[jcall@laptop ~]$ cat ~/bin/mac-changer.sh \n#!/bin/bash\n\nDEV=wlp3s0\nNEWMAC=9c:d9:17:2e:ae:5f\n\nif [ $# -lt 1 ]\nthen\n  echo \"You forgot to tell me which network to connect to...\"\n  echo \"Please run \\`nmcli con show\\` for ideas...\"\n  exit 1\nfi\n\nif $(nmcli -t -f NAME con show | grep -q $1)\nthen\n  nmcli connection modify --temporary $1 802-11-wireless.cloned-mac-address $NEWMAC\n  nmcli connection up $1\nelse\n  echo \"Error: $1 is not a known network.

I have to use a FORTRAN code which has a \"menu style\" interface. I access the code typing a command on the terminal which opens the main menu. From that point and beyond I type a number and enter it to choose an option that either opens a submenu or executes a command. To exit I have to navigate back to main menu and type \"0\" to end the code and \"get back to terminal\". For example, on the terminal I type:\ncode_command % opens the FORTRAN code main menu\n1 → I choose option 1 from main menu, which opens a submenu ;\n2 → From that submenu 1, I choose another submenu by typing option 2;\n7 → From inside this second submenu, I choose the 7th option that does the required task.\n0 → I get back from the second submenu\n0 → I get back from the the first submenu (to the main menu).\n0 → I leave the code and get back to the terminal \nSo I've written a list of commands that I had to type in order to do a certain task and saved this text as a \"script.sh\", to make the code execute this list I type:\ncode_command < script.sh\n\nFinally, It executes all the lines perfectly except for the last one, when it crashes so I have to open other terminal and type:\npkill code_command\n\nor Ctrl+Z from inside the crashed terminal window.\nIs there a way to program a Ctrl+Z  in the script.sh,  to kill the running code before it crashes?\n\nA: I'm assuming you are using bash though this works for the sh and csh too.  \nFirst: Set the ulimit core to non-zero (so that you can create a core dump). man bash and search for ulimit. ulimit -c <max size of core dump>.  The bash default is NO core dump and it must be re-entered every time a new window is opened or new session is started.\nSecond: Run your program and in another window kill -3 <pid> to see if the programs is still running and and get a core dump.  See man 7 signal and the \"SIGQUIT\" or \"-3\" option.\nThird. Use gdb to see the statement that caused the problem.  You will have to compile the program using with the \"-g\" option. gdb <fortran executable name> core.  gdb can be used to debug interactively.  (And is way beyond the question you asked).\nFrom what you mentioned in your question, you are not handling the EOF correctly for \"< input\" or stdin and is not exiting out of command loop and stopping.  Or you are in an endless loop or waiting for input in a submenu. The kill -3 <pid> finally kills the process EXACTLY where it is hung.\nCtrl+z is suspending the running fortran program. The executable is still running when it hangs.  If you enter the command fg for foreground, the fortran program would continue from where it was before the Ctrl+z.\n", "Q: How to install ubuntu on my Ipad?

And that should work!\n\nSee @ThomasWard's answer; it's more complete, and if you're using your server for anything web related (including updates), my answer will create major issues.\n\nA: Unfortunately, the other answer here doesn't take into account three cases which are relevant:\n\n\n*\n\n*Local traffic to the system itself.  (localhost, etc. via the lo adapter)\n\n*Traffic related to other traffic you've made (responses to outgoing connections, etc.)\n\n*ICMP responses from your own network (which are sometimes necessary depending on the network environment).\n\n\nMost residential networks or average networks have no need for #3, but #1 and #2 are critical - #1 so traffic to the system from the system works (think localhost connections for local services or sudo for its own internal hostname lookup), and #2 because you need to be able to receive traffic related to established connections you've made outbound to get DNS responses, HTTP/HTTPS packet data for your package installations or updates, etc.\nSo, the solution I would pose is you do this:\nIf you have any iptables rules already, flush them out with sudo iptables -F so we start with a 'clean slate' before doing this.\n# This first command is OK, setting INPUT to default ACCEPT becase\n# we will force all unpermitted traffic to DROP at the end of this ruleset.\nsudo iptables -P INPUT ACCEPT\nsudo iptables -A INPUT -i lo -m comment --comment \"Accept localhost, computer to itself\" -j ACCEPT\nsudo iptables -A INPUT -m conntrack --ctstate RELATED,ESTABLISHED -m comment --comment \"Accept traffic related to established connections and this system's outgoing traffic\" -j ACCEPT\nsudo iptables -A INPUT -s a.b.c.d --comment \"Accept inbound connections from a.b.c.d\" -j ACCEPT\nsudo iptables -A INPUT -s w.x.y.z --comment \"Accept inbound connections from w.x.y.z\" -j ACCEPT\n# Repeat previous line as many times as you need to in order to accept traffic\n# that you want to accept, but also add a line for the IP address you are \n# currently connected to the system from if a remote SSH session, otherwise\n# you may lock yourself out.\nsudo iptables -A INPUT -m comment --comment \"Drop all other traffic inbound\" -j DROP\n\nThis will do what anonymous2 was attempting to do but also permit your computer to still work with the Internet and letting your system function properly.  This also lets your system continue to operate until you add the DROP rule at the very end (don't add that rule until you've also whitelisted the IP address YOU are accessing from, which SHOULD be one of the ALLOW rules above, and you can add as MANY \nMake sure to install iptables-persistent and store these rules in /etc/iptables/rules.v4 or else these rules won't persist.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 for Dell Precision 7510 I got a new Dell Precision 7510 workstation for work which shipped with a Windows 7 Professional installation.

(apt-cache show celestia returns N: Can't select versions from package 'celestia' as it is purely virtual. The package celestia-common-nonfree does exist, but it's just a collection of data files, which don't conform to the DFSG, that are useless without the program itself.)\nLooking upstream, it seems that the package celestia was removed from Debian unstable, before Ubuntu 16.04 entered feature freeze, which (assuming my very vague understanding of the interaction between Debian and Ubuntu is correct) is why it's no longer present in Ubuntu 16.04.\nConsidering that Celestia hasn't seen any development in the recent past, removing it seems a reasonable course of action. OTOH it's still stable and functional, so it seems a shame, especially if it's still possible to build it on a modern system.\nDoes this mean that the only way of installing Celestia on Ubuntu 16.04 is building from source?\n\nA: I haven't tried it, but you can try to install it after downloading the package (and all its dependencies!) for Wily from here.\n\nA: The answer provided by dadexix86 works and if you want to check the checksums of the packages for security (since the packages aren't being installed by apt, their integrity is not automatically checked (I think)), it's probably best to do everything manually.\nHowever, for a simple copy-paste solution, the following bash commands should do the job (assuming you have a 64-bit, standard, fresh Ubuntu 16.04 installation):\nUBUNTU_MIRROR=https://www.mirrorservice.org/sites/archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/universe/c/celestia\n\n# common\nsudo apt-get install liblua5.1-0\nwget \"${UBUNTU_MIRROR}\"/celestia-common_1.6.1+dfsg-3_all.deb\nsudo dpkg -i celestia-common_1.6.1+dfsg-3_all.deb\n\nsudo apt-get install celestia-common-nonfree\n\n# for celestia-glut\nwget \"${UBUNTU_MIRROR}\"/celestia-glut_1.6.1+dfsg-3_amd64.deb\nsudo apt-get install freeglut3\nsudo dpkg -i celestia-glut_1.6.1+dfsg-3_amd64.deb\n\n# for celestia-gnome\nwget \"${UBUNTU_MIRROR}\"/celestia-gnome_1.6.1+dfsg-3_amd64.deb\nsudo apt-get install libgtkglext1 libgnome2-0 libgnomeui-0\nsudo dpkg -i celestia-gnome_1.6.1+dfsg-3_amd64.deb\n\nThis includes the dependencies (installed using apt from Xenial) and celestia-common-nonfree (also installed from Xenial).\n\nA: Celestia development looks like it's started again.

I have a simple configuration for now stored in ~/.Xdefaults. And it works fine whenever I launch it from the gnome-terminal. Here's a snap:\n\nThen I got to setting urxvt as my default terminal using update-alternatives.

I was wondering if there was a way to combine both the Bash script and the resources (everything else in the directory) into an executable, so that I would only need that executable stand-alone to execute the Bash script.\n\nA: Self-extracting scripts are possible, and not uncommon. They are often used by installers. The idea is simple:\n\n\n*\n\n*The top part of the script sets up the execution of the bottom\n\n*In the middle there is an exit command, to avoid executing the end part\n\n*The end part is a payload\n\n\nHere's a concrete example. Create script.sh with this content:\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\n\nme=$(cd \"$(dirname \"$0\")\"; pwd)/\"$(basename \"$0\")\"\n\ncd \"$(mktemp -d)\"\ntail -n +10 \"$me\" | tar zx\ncat local.txt\n\nexit\n\nThis corresponds to the top and middle part I mentioned earlier.\nEssentially this does:\n\n\n*\n\n*Extract the end part (line 10 and beyond) of this script itself into a temporary directory, using tar\n\n*Print the content of local.txt, which is expected in the temporary directory\n\n*Exit\n\n\nThis script is not complete, we need to add the end part, which is expected to be a zipped tar, containing a file named local.txt. Let's create that file first:\necho hello world > local.txt\n\nAnd let's put that file in a tar, and append it at the end of the script:\ntar zc local.txt >> script.sh\n\nIf you reopen script.sh in a text editor, you will see some gibberish at the end. That's binary data, the content of a zipped tar archive with local.txt in it. If you run this script, it will output hello world, from the embedded local.txt file that it unzips from itself.\nYou can use the same technique to create something meaningful and sophisticated.\n", "Q: How to monitor syslog and get alerted when there is a certain entry?

If I press Ctrl+Alt+T, it won't launch. I tried to launch a light terminal by pressing Ctrl+Alt+F1. The login screen to put my login and password appeared, the system accepted the login and password but quickly returned to the login screen. It's a kind of loop: I enter the login and the system returns to the login screen.

I'm so curious to try out the new Nvidia proprietary driver 367.18, because it supports the Vulkan API in the Steam game Dota 2. But I'm wondering if it's worth it, i.e. whether it's stable. I don't want to get things like black screens, flickering, glitches or worse. In that case I'd rather stay with the current graphics driver I'm on (340.96).\nDoes anybody have any experience with this, or know where I can go to find this kind of feedback?\nIs it generally okay to use new Nvidia graphics drivers if you're concerned with stability?\nThank you.\nSystem specifications:\nUbuntu 14.04.4 LTS\nLinux Kernel Version 3.13.0-86-generic\nAsus M4A78LT-M LE Motherboard\nAMD Athlon II X4 645, 3.10 GHz\nMushkin 8GB PC3 Blackline RAM (2 x 4GB)\n500GB Western Digital Hard Disk\nNvidia GeForce GTX 750 Ti\nNvidia Driver Version 340.96\n\nA: If you want stability and what you have now works fine for you, don't upgrade. There's always a risk.\nIf you need the new features it provides, then go ahead and upgrade, but only once you actually need the features.\nFor me, the newest drivers tend to work well, but that's just my experience. Every single card (even model vs. same model) is different. Everyone has a slightly different experience. It could work amazingly for you and terribly for anther person with the same GPU.\nI believe 367 is a beta, so it's not technically stable. However, like I said earlier, it could work perfectly for you. It could also be a disaster, however. \nThe best way to find out which it will be is to just do the upgrade. Of course, we could make predictions based on your hardware, but those predictions would be highly based on opinion and therefore off-topic on this site.\nIf the newest drivers do end up being unstable, it's almost always possible to just go into a TTY and reverse the upgrade. That, however, is a different topic, and one that has already been covered multiple times here and on various forums and Q&A sites. If you run into problems, comment, and I can link you to some topics that may help you out.\n\nA: Yes, the new Nvidia  proprietary driver should work well on your PC. Nvidia drivers have a much better reputation in Ubuntu than it's rival, AMD. From my experience, every time I have upgraded a Nvidia proprietary driver on Ubuntu, I have not encountered a SINGLE problem. So..... You should be good to go! \nGood luck!\n", "Q: Error deploying Landscape after MAAS step I have also posted in github the same question.

Note that I didn't get any errors.

You might wanna check to see your firewall is not an issue here in case the traffic is blocked (though you can telnet to it).  \n\nA: I could imagine a number of things going wrong but I suspect you may have defined an apt proxy in maas and perhaps formatted it like 'ip:port' instead of 'http://ip:port'\nJust a guess.  That setting is in the MAAS UI, in the settings area.\n", "Q: How do I properly install Steam on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS? Just as the title says.

Thanks.\nEdit: I'm not talking about using wine in this case, just using the actual package from Valve themselves.\n\nA: You nearly had it correct, to install steam you need to add the -i flag to dpkg like this:\nsudo dpkg -i steam_latest.deb\n\nAnd if that still fails you can install python-apt this way, which you as well had almost right:\nsudo apt-get install python-apt\n\n\nA: As you are trying to install Steam, here is a different approach: Install Steam directly from Ubuntu's multiverse repository\nsudo add-apt-repository multiverse\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install steam\n\nReference: https://linuxconfig.org/how-to-install-steam-on-ubuntu-16-04-xenial-xerus\n", "Q: I can't find other language for Krita which is installed by snap, and there is no icon for Krita, either As you can see, there is English only.\n\nAs you can see, there is no icon for Krita.\n\n\nA: The launcher icon should be there now, if you have version 3.0-snap11\nThe translations are going to take some work in the packaging, but it's possible to do.

And please be specific to me while explaining the matter because I am very new-be in the world of Linux.

Ever since upgrading to 16.04, DNS resolution fails (returns Host Not Found) on the first attempt for any website. I can then immediately try it a second time and it works just fine.\nA little background:\n\n\n*\n\n*I have on my network a server running an older version of Ubuntu, and\na Windows PC. Both of these are unaffected (using the same DNS\nservers as the problem computer).\n\n*After poking around on the web a bit, I took someone's advice and\nremoved and purged resolvconf. That fixed the problem... until I\nrebooted. Then DNS resolution did not work at all (I fixed that but\nam back to square one now).\n\n\nIn my limited understanding, what seems to be happening is that when a query for a new website comes to the local DNS cache (resolvconf?), it is not in the cache, so the reply is empty. Then when the same query comes again, some process has in the meantime resolved the address and updated the cache, so the cache replies with the address.\nWhat I want is that if the requested address is not in the cache, it will go and find it before replying the first time.

So all requests first go to dnsmasq (127.0.0.1) and if the domain is not cached the request goes to 192.168.1.1 (my router which also runs a dns server, you could of course use something like 8.8.8.8)\nThis workaround is not ideal I know - but it works for now. \nI am by the way also using a fresh installation of Ubuntu 16.04\n", "Q: after updating, my laptop doesn't turn on I'm using Ubuntu 15.10. firstly i updated my laptop as usual, it gives me instruction of restart, after restart my laptop not on.\nI tried 'Advanced Options for Ubuntu' recovery process, but nothing works.\nHere's the error message:\n\n\nA: You need to run fsck manualy.  boot with a dvd or pendrive and got to a terminal.\nThen type  fdisk -l you should get an output like\nDevice       Start       End   Sectors   Size Type\n/dev/sda1     2048   1050623   1048576   512M EFI System\n/dev/sda2  1050624   1550335    499712   244M Linux filesystem\n/dev/sda3  1550336 468860927 467310592 222,9G Linux LVM\n\nwhith \"/dev/sda*\" or \"/dev/sdb*\" or something like\nDisk /dev/mapper/ubuntu--vg-root: 213 GiB, 228665065472 bytes, 446611456 sectors\n\nif you use lvm partitions\nThen you can run fsck with \n  fsck /dev/sda1\n\nor\nfsck /dev/mapper/ubuntu--vg-root\n\n", "Q: 16.04: Apache2 and php not working!

This may mean that you have\nrequested an impossible situation or if you are using the unstable\ndistribution that some required packages have not yet been created\nor been moved out of Incoming.\nThe following information may help to resolve the situation:\n\nThe following packages have unmet dependencies:\n php7.0-mbstring : Depends: php7.0-common (= 7.0.4-7ubuntu2.1) but 7.0.6-13+donate.sury.org~xenial+1 is to be installed\nE: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages\n\nI have tried to follow the instructions on how to fix broken packages but even tht has not helped. Hope someone can atleast help me find the right fault.\n.\n\nA: This is no error, use sudo ufw status to check it, it simply tells you that a rule for that already exists. \nBest is to get a bit familiar with ufw on command line by reading the manual\nAs for the second problem you added, make sure you enable the package sources in System Settings --> Software & Updates then run an:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get -f install\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\nRunning the first and third command mostly keeps you out of trouble when trying to install something new. As well you only need to use php-mbstring thats the virtual package for the installation. So this will suffice:\nsudo apt-get install php-mbstring\n\n\nA: Ok,\nI had exactly the same problem.\nMy answer is not very clean but it does work.\n\n\n*\n\n*First I installed aptitude: sudo apt-get install aptitude\n\n*Then I asked aptitude to install php-mbstring: sudo aptitude install php-mbstring \n\n*It asked me to make some choices to install it, so I didn't accept the first one (that was, \"don't install php-mbstring\"), I accepted the second one that was \"downgrade a bunch of php modules to the right one\n\n*Now I have php-mbstring\n\\o/\n", "Q: ubuntu kernel git for xenial gives wrong source version I'm trying to pull kernel sources from this location:\nhttp://kernel.ubuntu.com/git/ubuntu/ubuntu-xenial.git/\nAnd I'm expecting to see 4.4.0-21/22 related sources.\nWhat I'm getting is 4.4.8 version code.

Put in a Western Digital-blue 320 GB disk.  \nUsing a freeware bootable CD formatted the hard drive and it found zero bad blocks.  It currently has Fat32.  Want to use whatever Ubuntu likes best.\nThere will be no other OS.  Just Ubuntu on a Dell 3521 Laptop.\n\n\n*\n\n*What version of Ubuntu should I use?\n\n*Then make how a bootable Ubuntu install CD.\nThanks.\n\nA: As for #1 of your question, I just looked at the specs online and you should be able to use the latest version of Ubuntu (16.04 LTS) with ease.\nFor #2 of you questions I want to simply point you to the right direction for more information. This you will find here.\nAs far of the format for the HDD, leave it blank, the installer will handle that for you, just make sure to disable fast boot and secure boot as its known to cause troubles along the way.\n", "Q: fuse: unknown option `defer_permissions' The following error is given when trying to connect to a remote host using sshfs on Ubuntu (16.04 LTS):\nfuse: unknown option `defer_permissions'\n\nafter using the command:\nsshfs -o allow_other,defer_permissions username@remotehost.com:/ /mnt/connected/\n\nwhich is provided in this Digital Ocean tutorial.\nRemoving the option \"defer_permissions\" allows the command to successfully execute, and the remote host folder is mounted to the local /mnt/connected/; however, the permissions appear incorrect.\nIf \"defer_permissions\" is an unknown option, what option should be used to get the correct permissions when mounting a folder with sshfs?\n\nA: Having looked at the sshfs man page, I'd say that defer_permissions does not exist as an option. However, default_permissions is listed.\nI've used this and so far it's working for me.  \nCould there be a typo in the instructions you were following?  (Would it be https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-sshfs-to-mount-remote-file-systems-over-ssh by any chance?)\nI'm sticking with the typo theory unless anyone else knows better.\n\nA: The defer_permissions option fixes some issues on translating filesystem permissions when mounting SSH filesystem from Mac OS.\nThat's the reason why it's useless (and maybe have been removed from command syntax) when mounting from Ubuntu, while it works when launched from a Mac.\n", "Q: JVM memory full on my Ubuntu server Dspace is installed on my Ubuntu server. It's JVM memory is very low. Any way to increase the JVM memory?\n\nA: Firstly you can increase the size for your needs when starting:\njava -Xms<size>\n\n means memory.\nand this command can be used...\njava -Xmx \nmeans the max size.\nRemember to put m or mb after the number etc: 1024mb **or else the poor little memory thought you meant bytes....\nAnd to mark me as answered click that tick over there.\n:)\nEDIT: You want to MAX the memory PERMANENTLY? (well unless if you undo it)\nUse these:\n-XX:PermSize<size>\n\nand this for MAX\nXX:MaxPermSize<size>\n\nFor ubuntu, remove XX and replace it with java\n", "Q: Why does Ubuntu 16.04 Eject SD Cards Itself?

Keep defaults, not those greedy power-saving settings in the guideline. I experience a series of lost connections to my memory card, which I do not want. So no 99macbookair6 because it does not work as described.  \n\n*Backlight. Broken links in the manual in wget http://miek.nl/downloads/2013/mba6xbl-dkms_0.0.1_all.deb.\n\n*I already did AVAHI_DAEMON_DETECT_LOCAL=0 in sudo gedit /etc/default/avahi-daemon to avoid conflicts with avahi service on LAN. Not related but can complicate. \n\n\n\nWhy does Ubuntu 16.04 eject itself SD cards after screen lock/night?\n\nA: This is a filesystem problem. See the answer here and check the problems by sudo fsck.vfat /dev/... if your SD card is FAT32.\n", "Q: How to check serial number of NVMe disk? How to check serial number of NVMe disk? \nTo check serial number for sda and sdb I used:\nsudo lsblk --raw -o name,type,serial\n\nHowever it does not work for NVMe disks (nvme0n0, nvme0n1 etc). No information about serial number is provided.\n\nA: The nvme tool provides options to obtain NVME device information, for example, to install the tool, list the NVME devices and look at the id control fields on /dev/nvme0n1, one would use:\nsudo apt-get install nvme-cli\nsudo nvme list\nsudo nvme id-ctrl /dev/nvme0n1\n\n\nA: You can use good old sysfs and cat for that:\n$ cat /sys/block/nvme0n1/device/serial\nPHNH912345441P0B\n\nAlso as @VZ pointed out modern versions of lsblk will output serial numbers for NVMe drives correctly.\nExample:\n$ lsblk -d -o TRAN,NAME,TYPE,MODEL,SERIAL,SIZE\nTRAN   NAME         TYPE MODEL               SERIAL             SIZE\n       mmcblk0      disk                     0xda61bcdf        14.6G\n       mmcblk0boot0 disk                     0xda61bcdf           4M\n       mmcblk0boot1 disk                     0xda61bcdf           4M\nnvme   nvme0n1      disk INTEL SSDPEKNW010T8 PHNH912345441P0B 953.9G\n\n\nA: Note that there are two kinds of M.2 drives - the NVMe and the SATA - and they present completely different interfaces.\nThis is as evidenced by the completely different dev device name: /dev/sd? for SATA, and /dev/nvme0n1 for NVMe.\nIf you download smartmontools 6.6, it has experimental NVMe support built in and can show serial number as I remember. (smartctl -a, again IIRC).\nOtherwise, for NVMe drives you indeed need the nvme-cli tools to be able to do anything more than smartctl can do.\n\nA: another way to get drive information is to run hdparm\nsudo hdparm -i /dev/sda /dev/sdb\n\nThat will give you info on both your disks\nFWIW , my laptop has a built in LITEONIT LMT-512L9M-11 MSATA 512GB which does report its serial number via your command and mine. It maybe that your disk doesn't actually return it or that its newness means not enough linux developers have access to them.\n", "Q: watch not work with \"pkill ffmpeg; ffmpeg -i\" Im using ffmpeg to record online stream. I want to record in small pieces \nwith killing ffmpeg process and starting again. Trying to do it with command \nwatch -n 40 \"pkill ffmpeg; ffmpeg -i http://SiteName.com/playlist.m3u8 radioSTREAM.$(date +%d-%m-%g-%Hh%Mm%Ss).mp3\" but it stucking. How to make it work ? \nAdditional question is how to put all this construction in at command?\n\nA: A more elegant solution is to use the segment muxer:\nffmpeg -i input -c copy -f segment -segment_time 40 output_%03d.mp3\n\nResults in approximately 40 second segments:\n$ ls -m1\noutput_000.mp3\noutput_001.mp3\n...\noutput_010.mp3\n\nThe example avoids re-encoding by using stream copy mode, and assumes the input and output formats are the same (MP3 in this example).\n\nA: Put it in a shell script so that you have less tricky escaping, you can the also run that shell script from the at command\nIf you run the shell script as follows\nbash -x ./script.sh \n\nYou will see what values the variables have at each point in the script.\n", "Q: My Wifi Card is not called wlan0 but wlp18s0b1, how then to configure my Ubuntu Server? after some serious digging I finally realised that the problem with setting up my Ubuntu server via wifi is not working because wlan0 is not configured but it turns out that wlp18s0b1 is!?

Get uBlock Origin, not uBlock — that is a discontinued fork.\n\nA: I had similar. the adware will be in your profile, so a browser re-install is useless.  \nA/ in chromium, do: 1/ settings/ advanced/ reset settings.  this worked for me.  2/ next, install extension \"chrome adware removal\". this ext seems best to block and strip adware before it infects.  \nB/ if you have a malware, you can try clamav, but I have found a wipe and system reinstall to be the only sure means to disinfect. \n\nA: There is a simple solution for this.

As terdon and Rinzwind pointed out the \"Permission denied\" error was due to not having execution permits in my external SDcard. I downloaded and extracted the ubuntu image in a folder in my home directory and I can now chroot in it just fine. Thanks!\n\nA: I am not at all sure the bug you linked to is relevant here. You can't just chroot to an arbitrary directory like that. By default, chroot will set / to the directory you gave it and then try to run /bin/sh (or whatever the default shell is). Since there is no /bin/sh in the target directory, it complains. That's what you see in the first error:\nchroot: failed to run command ‘/bin/bash’: No such file or directory\n\nThe second error is probably because you have mounted a FAT or NTFS partition in the external drive and you haven't set it up to allow execution. It looks like /path/to/external/bin/sh exists but can't be executed. Try mounting the SD card with execution enabled.\nNote that the guide you linked to tells you to download an Ubuntu image and use that as the chroot target. It doesn't tell you to use your home directory for it!\nTo illustrate:\n$ sudo chroot .\nchroot: failed to run command ‘/bin/bash’: No such file or directory\n$ cp /bin/busybox bin/sh \n$ sudo chroot /bin/sh   ### works!\n# /\n\n\nA: Try to do that from a folder not inside /home like\nchroot path_chroot_folder\n\nLook at the\n comment in the bug report link you shared about doing \"chroot .\"\n specifically\n\nJamie Strandboge (jdstrand) wrote on 2016-01-15: #3\n  The reason why this doesn't work is because this rule carves out /home:\n  /[^h][^o][^m][^e]** pix,\n  We needed to do that for autopilot fakeenv-style tests.

You can now do anything, including creating that file.\nWhy are there two accounts if I can access it anyway?\nPrivilege separation — the idea that you should only get the power to do/destroy anything when you need it. A major contributor to Linux's excellent reputation for security is due to the fact that it separates admin from user.\nIf you would run as root all the time, any virus could destroy your system very easily.\n\nA: Use the following command\nsu administrator\n\n\"Enter root password of admin\"\ncd \"path of the file\"\n\nsudo gedit \"filename\"\n\nRoot is the equivalent default super user to administrator.

So, for example, if you booted up Windows last time, then it will boot up Windows again.\nWhen grub first loads, there is a timeout (usually 10 seconds but can be changed) and if you don't select an operating system before this time, it will boot up the default.\nIn order to get grub to default to the last selected Operating System, you need to adjust the file that is located in /etc/default/grub.\nsudo nano /etc/default/grub is probably the easiest way to edit this file.\nYou want to change the line GRUB_DEFAULT=0 to GRUB_DEFAULT=saved and also add the line GRUB_SAVEDEFAULT=true\nWhen you've exited and saved the file, run sudo update-grub and on your next reboot the default choice for grub will be the last booted Operating System.\nFor Legacy boot, installing Ubuntu (and subsequently the grub bootloader) does technically replace the 'Windows bootloader' (\"GRUB 2 normally writes its bootloader information to an area just beyond the Master Boot Record and before the first partition\" which is where the 'Windows bootloader' would be) but grub will load Windows quite happily when selected.\nWith a UEFI boot of Windows, it doesn't even replace the Windows bootloader. Grub becomes the first UEFI boot option and if Windows is selected then Grub just points it to the Windows Boot Manager and away you go.\nThe 'Windows bootloader' (or Windows Boot Manager as they seem to call it) isn't replaced or changed, your machine just loads grub first.\nHere is an example of what my grub bootloader shows me:\n\nI mention all this because you say you 'don't want to replace the Windows bootloader' but unless there is a particularly complicated reason for why you don't wish to do this, then having the grub bootloader installed on your Hard Disk should not cause any problems.\nBy changing the grub default choice, you will have almost the same behaviour that you are after, but with a short delay of a few seconds as grub waits for you to choose.\nThis will also mean you don't have to go get the USB every time you want to boot Ubuntu.\n(Something worth mentioning is that if your Windows installation is using UEFI, then when you are installing Ubuntu you will want to press f12 to get the 'one-time boot menu' up and then select the USB under the UEFI Boot options, to ensure that Ubuntu is installed as UEFI also.)\nHere is a picture to show you what I mean, with the 'UEFI: TDK' being the USB stick I am wanting to use:\n\n\nA: The following method is not very elegant, but it is easy.\nUse mkusb to make a Persistent USB of any handy Ubuntu ISO file.\nTake the USB drive into gparted.\nDelete all USB partitions except the 125MB fat32 partition, the one with the Boot Flag.\nRemove the Boot Flag.\nCopy the UUID of the internal Ubuntu partition while in gparted.\nClose gparted.\n(You can also open the grub.cfg file of the internal drive with a text editor and copy UUID and kernel version, if there is an internal grub.cfg file).\nOpen boot/grub/grub.cfg of the USB with a text editor\nReplace the existing menuentries with the following:\nmenuentry \"ubuntu\" {\n      search --no-floppy --fs-uuid --set=root uuid-number-of-your-internal-ubuntu-partition\n    linux   /vmlinuz-kernel-version root=UUID=uuid-number-of-your-internal-ubuntu-partition quiet splash --\n    initrd  /initrd.img-kernel-version\n}\n\nuuid-number-of-your-internal-ubuntu-partition is the internal UUID and kernel-version is the kernel version of your internal Ubuntu install, (4.4.0-31-generic for 16.04.1).\nGo back into gparted and reset the Boot Flag.\nYou can set this boot flash drive as the first hard drive in grub or hit F12 when booting to choose it.\nAn alternate method when installing Ubuntu to hard drive is to choose \"Something else\" when partitioning. \nThis will allow you to install Ubuntu to HDD and save the boot loader to the Flash drive.\n\nA: Not really. Check this out for full explaination\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/MultiOSBoot\n\nA: You can do this by turning off the ESP flag on your internal HDD prior to installing Ubuntu, and of course making sure you create an EFI partition on your external drive, and telling the Ubuntu installer that your external drive is the device where you want the boot loader to do.\nYou'd think steps 2 and 3 would be sufficient, but a longstanding bug in the Ubuntu installer will ignore your request to install grub on the external drive if it sees an existing EFI partition on your internal drive. So disconnecting your internal drive works,but you can get the same effect by using gparted to turn off the ESP flag on the internal drive's EFI partition before installing. \nFull instructions here: https://askubuntu.com/a/1056079/152287\n", "Q: Can Ubuntu utilize a i7(4 core)?

Those are the minimum and maximum speeds in MegaHertz.\nNow again in terminal type gedit ~/bin/cpuss\nYou can see the 2 values in the 4th and 11th lines.  Change those number to the ones that were shown to you before, in my example it was 800 and 3100.\nSave and close the script.\nFINALLY, in terminal, type chmod +x ~/bin/cpuss to make the script executable.\nNow at anytime, you can type in how many Mhz you max speed should be.  For example, in terminal, type\n~/bin/cpuss 1000 and this will limit your max speed to 1000Mhz, or, 1Ghz, which is more than enough to run most flash games, and will keep your computer cooler.\nFor some reason, something in Ubuntu resets the cpu max speed now and then.  So if you notice it get hotter all of a sudden, run the command again.\nYou can also go even lower, like 850 or 900, as long as it's higher than the original number you saw.  But the way I wrote the script, and the reason you had to find those 2 numbers, you don't have to worry about the number being too low or too high because it checks the limits first.\nAlso wanted to note that for some reason, Google Chrome games from the Web Store sometimes bypass the max limit somehow.  But normal flash games are fine.\nIf you add /bin to your $PATH, you can execute cpuss from anywhere in terminal without the ~/bin/ part.\nDo this by editing your /.profile file.  In terminal, gedit ~/.profile.\nAt the bottom of this file, if you don't have the following part, add it:\n# set PATH so it includes user's private bin if it exists\nif [ -d \"$HOME/bin\" ] ; then\n    PATH=\"$HOME/bin:$PATH\"\nfi\n\nSave and close.  This will let files in your ~/bin directory be accessible from anywhere.  If you had to add that bit of code, log out and log back in for changes to take effect.  Now you can use the cpuss script in terminal no matter what directory you're currently in.\nBONUS SCRIPT\nBelow is a separate but handy script to verify the first one is working.\nPut this in a file, save and make it executable.\n#!/bin/bash\nwhile sleep 1;do clear && cpufreq-info | grep 'CPU frequency' && printf '\\n Press CTRL+C to exit';done\n\nWhen you run it, it'll show you this output\n  current CPU frequency is 800 MHz.\n  current CPU frequency is 800 MHz.\n  current CPU frequency is 809 MHz.\n  current CPU frequency is 804 MHz.\n  current CPU frequency is 891 MHz.\n  current CPU frequency is 800 MHz.\n  current CPU frequency is 830 MHz.\n  current CPU frequency is 894 MHz.\n\n Press CTRL+C to exit\n\nIt'll update every second, and you can keep track of the speeds of all your cores.\n", "Q: Cannot run conjure-up due to LXD permission denied error I did follow the instructions:\nhttp://conjure-up.io/docs/users/\nbut step two works with default values and step 3 fails with the below:\nany ideas how to get setup LXD properly.

I need a way to select which OS to boot on the next reboot. I can do that from within OSX and Windows (through Bootcamp) but I also need a way to tell my machine to boot OSX on the next reboot.\nI can't hold ALT on boot to select the OS in the visual EFI screen, because my video card doesn't support that (upgraded my Mac).\nPS: I tried efibootmgr but that doesn't show me the actual EFI boot options, only the options available in Grub (e.g. rEFIt does not appear as an option).\n\nA: You are wrong, efibootmgr does not show grub entries only.  List what's in nvram of your machine with\nsudo efibootmgr -v\n\nand then use the\nsudo efibootmgr  -n xxxx\n\nto select the next boot item.\nIf you have a bootloader not listed in the nvram list, then it is probably in the device default location, e.g. /EFI/Boot/bootx64.efi.  In that case, you can make an nvram entry, and then refer to that entry with the bootnext flag.\n", "Q: Ubuntu crashes when setting maximum resolution on external 4K monitor Problem\nWhen attempting to set the resolution of my 4K external display to 3840x2160, the external display loses signal and moments later the entire system hangs. \nThe display is connected to my XPS 13 9350 Developer Edition running Ubuntu 16.04 using a USB-C to DisplayPort adapter.\nHardware:\n\n\n*\n\n*Machine: Dell XPS 13 9350 (3200x1800 resolution display version)\n\n*OS Version: Ubuntu 16.04\n\n*Display: Dell P2415Q\n\n*Adapters:\n\n\n*\n\n*VicTop Type C to DisplayPort Adapter\n\n*BENFEI USB 3.1 Type C to Displayport Adapter\nAttempted Fixes\nSetting Resolution Manually\nI have tried using xrandr to manually set the mode and refresh rate of the display.

I am using the Plugable USB-C to DisplayPort Adapter Cable. \nUpgrading the kernel to v4.8-rc2 seems to solve this problem. I am writing this post on the external monitor running at 3840x2160 60Hz.\nHaving said that, it is pretty unstable.

In the old (and slow!) software-center it was default - which I appreciated, as I usually find the software via software centers and install via the terminal.  (Reason: long story, but there is a good reason.)  Is it possible to see the package titles in the gnome-software program?\n\nA: Looks like the answer is no for now at least, gnome are obsessed with simplifying everything to the point it is almost useless (IMO).\nThere are some alternatives though if you like more information.\nThe old software center is still available\nsudo apt install software-center\n\nAlso synaptic package manger offers a front end for apt with all the information you can eat\nsudo apt install synaptic\n\nThere are also websites to visit Ubuntufree seems nice, I never used it though and the apps directory too but it seems to not be updated as of writing.\n", "Q: Virt-Manager to Remote host - continuous password prompt over ssh I setup KVM on a remote host, and have a few .iso files out there that I want to play with. \nI setup Virt-manager initially on a Ubuntu-mate 15.10 machine, and it seemed to work fine (slow as heck starting the virtual machines) but worked. \nNow, I'm trying to do the same with virt-manager from my Ubuntu 16.04 install, and first out of the gate I got a message that I needed ssh-askpass-gnome to be prompted for the password, so I installed it. \nNow, when I start the Virt-Manager GUI monitor, it continuously prompts me for my SSH password, and the virtual machine never gets booted?  Shouldn't it be booting \"headless\" when I run it without the monitor anyway?\nSo, 2 questions to clarify?\n\n\n*\n\n*why does it keep prompting for my ssh password?  I know some people say use keys, but seriously...for new users like me, shouldn't the username password thing work on ssh for playing around?\n\n*Why doesn't the VM boot \"headless\" before the monitor even starts?\nThanks, \nBTW - I do have it set to use VNC over Spice...just in case anyone thought that might be the issue.\n\nA: *\n\n*Shut down the guest machine.\n\n*In the 'Display' section, select All interfaces instead of 'Only localhost'.\n\n*Restart the guest machine\n\n\nA: I have the same trouble. In order to resolve it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Run ssh-copy-id <your kvm server>.\nIn my case, from my laptop: ssh-copy-id hypervisor@IP_OF_MY_UBUNTU_SERVER_RUN_KVM\n\n*Now when I connect to virt-manager it doesn't ask for a password and when I want view the GUI console I can without any password request.\n\nA: So, I'm a bit of an idiot I guess.  I found a different place to set the VNC vs. Spice setting. Not sure why it's in 2 places.  \nBut, to help those trying to find it, should any others fall into what I did, when you start the Monitor (to see the UI), then you'll want to click the 'i' button in the circle on that window. \nThen find 'Display' in the left pane, and from there, select VNC.

Can I do this somehow with wildcards?\n\nA: It's possible to extract specific files using wildcards, but mimetype- or permission-based filtering can't be done without extracting the file first.\nFor filtering the files, these options are useful:\n --exclude=PATTERN\n       exclude files, given as a PATTERN\n\n --null\n       -T reads null-terminated names, disable -C\n\n -T, --files-from FILE\n       get names to extract or create from FILE\n\n --wildcards\n       use wildcards (default for exclusion)\n\n --wildcards-match-slash\n       wildcards match '/' (default for exclusion)\n\n --no-wildcards-match-slash\n       wildcards do not match '/'\n\n --no-wildcards\n       verbatim string matching\n\n -X, --exclude-from FILE\n       exclude patterns listed in FILE\n\nFor example:\n$ tar tf foo.tar \nfoo/\nfoo/c/\nfoo/c/file\nfoo/b/\nfoo/b/text\nfoo/a/\nfoo/a/executable\n$ cat list.txt\n*l*\n$ tar tf ../foo.tar --wildcards --no-anchored -T list.txt\nfoo/c/file\nfoo/a/executable\n\nSo, only the files containing l were printed.\nFor mimetype or permissions, tar can write the output file to an external command. tar provides information via environment variables about the filename, type, permissions, path, etc., which you can then use to detect the mimetype and permissions and save the file accordingly. But then you'd have to take care of ownership and permission yourself, and temporary storage of the file as well.\n", "Q: How to delete all files in current directory but keep files in subfolders I have a structure like this\n\n\n*\n\n*file_1\n\n*file_2\n...\n\n*file_n\n\n*folder1/\n\n\n*\n\n*sub_file_1\n\n*sub_file_2\n\n\n\nI only want to delete file_1, file_2 and file_n but keep all folders and files in them.\n\nA: Just run:\nrm *\n\nIt's that simple.  It won't touch the directories unless you add the -R or -r flag:\nrm -r *\n\nIf you also want to delete empty directories, add the --dir flag:\nrm --dir *\n\n\nA: rm without the -r, disabling recursive directory removal flag and shell globbing:\nrm /path/to/dir/*\n\nAdd the -f if you don't want to be prompted.\nYou can also use find:\nfind /path/to/dir -maxdepth 1 -type f -exec rm -rf '{}' \\;\n\nwhich works because of a maxdepth of 1, thus selecting only top-level files.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 16.04 First Time Install I'm creating a second PC to do some tinkering with out of parts from my old PC.

Since I have HDD and I want to reduce my boot time, I am deciding to move from ureadahead to e4rat,\nBut I have a doubt since e4rat have not been developed after 2012-05-03 according to here, but If you look for ureadahead thing is similar, seems to be no any new major releases after 2009-11-29 according to launchpad, but Ubuntu 16.04 also still uses ureadahead 0.100.0-19.(according to launchpad). I found that e4rat was faster comparatively to ureadahead in 2010-2013 period(according to old posts). Is e4rat still faster than ureadhead? or is there any new ureadahead versions which is faster than e4rat(that I have missed)?\n\nA: Let's look what does the beasts do\n\n*\n\n*ureadahead only caches frequently used files, and reads them into RAM on boot.\n\n\n*e4rat consist of different tools, one is e4rat-realloc, which moves around frequently used files so, that their blocks would lay close one to another, reducing movement path of a magnetic head of HDD for loading those files.\nAnd e4rat-preload tool, which does (upon added to kernel parameters) the same job as ureadahead. Interestingly, Archlinux wiki mentions possibility to use e4rat and ureadahead at the same time, though without details. They perhaps meant using ureadahead instead of e4rat-preaload.\nHence for HDDs e4rat would always be faster than ureadahead is. For SSDs, for their random access time is the same as for adjacent blocks, re-fragmentation of files makes no sense. Hence the only tools touching perfomance are e4rat-preload and ureadahead, and for their job is the same, the perfomance would be the same too.\nNB: due to SSDs being fast, ureadahead boosts perfomance not that much there. This led to discussion between systemd developers, who're using primarily SSDs nowadays. As it's useful anyway, they asked if anybody wanted to take maintainership for its analog systemd-readahead. Nobody stood up for, and so it was removed from the systemd. So, I'd expect that development of ureadahead and e4rat would slow down too, if it isn't already.\n", "Q: Deja-Dup - send message after backup Is it possible to send automatically mail or message via TCP port when backup is made by Deja Dup and when backups are scheduled eg. weekly.\n\nA: Sadly no, this is not possible.

First, I'm a total newbie to this platform and only have a very basic knowledge of command line input in Terminal...\nLong story short, I have a five disk LaCie RAID box (RAID 5) that seems to have had a hardware failure within the box itself, not just a drive. I am trying to rescue the information contained on the drives. 4 of the 5 still seem to be intact. Via bits and pieces of articles on the web I have gotten Ubuntu to recognize them as part of the same RAID, but I'm at a loss as to how to get the RAID to mount so I can access it on my network (Mac environment) and back up the data to a new drive.\nI can't seem to find any command line inputs which make sense for my situation, and I'm not having any luck installing a GUI mounting app either. I tried several times to install pysdm, but could never get it to work.\nThanks!\n\nA: If you need to mount the drive,\nRun \nsudo fdisk -l\n\nLocate the drive and the mount it with\nsudo mount /dev/sd## /location to mount\n\nFYI replace ## with your corresponding drive. Also make sure you have created the directory where you intend to mount\nIf you are then trying to make the mounted drive network accessible through Ubuntu, use Samba. There is plenty of documentation on this on the Internet. start here\n\nA: You said it is RAID5 correct, RAID 5 is set up to rebuild itself if a drive fails, you need to look at your Lacie instructions, it should tell you that you replace the bad drive in the RAID set, and then the Lacie will rebuild the data on the drive.  \nRAID 5 is what is called a stripe set, each drive contains data from the other drives that will allow the RAID to rebuild itself.\nLacie I believe is a hardware raid, which means your drives are probably hot swappable, so you don't even have to shut down the Lacie device to do this.

The Ubuntu OS is on a small SSD and I have 2 additional harddrives mounted to /media/drive1 and /media/drive2.\nNow I as far as I know I have 2 options in making these drives accessible from my Windows PC: \n\n\n*\n\n*Make 2 Samba shares, one for each drive\n\n*Make 1 Samba share, of the complete /media/ folder\n\n\nCurrently my goal is to copy data from drive 1 to drive 2 (so locally on the server), from the comfort of Explorer on my Windows desktop.\nIf I make 2 shares, one for each drive, the local copy speed is simply impossible to work with. It ranges around 20-50 KB/s with rare spikes to 1-1.5 MB/s and every 20 or so seconds it just dies and stalls at 0. \nFrom what I've read I now assume this is because the files first have be copied to my windows desktop and be re-uploaded to the server. I guess that 2 shares aren't interpreted as 'local' anymore. Why it completely stalls out though I don't understand.\nIf I make 1 share, with the entire /media/ directory, I get problems with 'insufficient disk space' when trying to copy files from drive 1 to drive 2, even though there is plenty space. I can copy 80 GB at a time, but never more than 80 GB at once. The speed when copying this way is normal though, around 70-80 MB/s with some spikes to 90 MB/s +.\nI now discovered that this happens because Samba checks the available space on drive of the directory you point at, in this case /media, and this folder is on the small SSD. The SSD only has 80 GB free space, so the math checks out.\nSo I guess the question is, any way to solve this so I can have the best of 2 worlds? I'd like to be able to copy files within the server from one disk to the other without having these limitations, from the comfort of my desktop windows explorer.\nAppendix: This is the template I use to create my shares in smb.conf\nThe authentication and access and such all work, no issues.\n[Drive1]\n    comment = Drive1\n    path = /media/drive1\n    browsable = yes\n    guest ok = no\n    valid users = @samba\n    read only = no\n    create mask = 0755\n\n\nA: It will be nasty workaround:\ncreate file /usr/local/bin/dfree_Drive.sh\n#!/bin/bash\ndf | egrep '/media/drive[0-9]+$' | awk '{total+=$2; avail+=$4; print $0} END{print total, avail}'\n\nand make it executable. Then in share section of your samba configuration add:\n    dfree command = /usr/local/bin/dfree_Drive.sh\n\nThis solution is nasty, because it lies to client about capacity of shared volume. But as far as I know there is no way to make samba aware of capacity of specific folder (in contrast to volume).\n", "Q: How to boot Ubuntu faster from USB-install. What factors affects the OS? Hello I just installed Ubuntu 14.04 in my HP 2.0 pen drive. **(Installed not Live USB).Eventhough I have 4 GB RAM and 2 GB Nvidia Graphics card and i5 processor, it is lagging so much. One click on an icon and it freezes for a minute before it resumes. I've read articles that read and write will be slower in flash memory.\nIs this bottleneck due to USB or the pendrive? If it is a pen drive I can take another internal harddisk and connect it as an external disk. Will this make the ubuntu booting and running faster and act as normal desktop OS? Or the whole USB thing is slower in general compared to internal harddisks?\n\nA: I think in your case the bottleneck seems to be the USB 2 480 Mbit/s max conetcetion, that make it feel painfull slow.\nSo another internal drive conectect via USB2 won't help, you need to either install it intenaly, (but I assume, windws lays there already or us USB 3 speed hardware.\nFeel free to ask futher if there are questions open.\nedit: and Welcome to Stack Exchange.\n\nA: The simple answer is that you are running an OS on the USB bus, and that is the slowest bus on your system.  (FYI when I say bus, I am not making an analogy to a people bus)\nYour computer is designed to give a faster bus to the hard drive system, the USB bus is for peripherals, so it has less priority.  Unless the machine was designed to run from USB, then this is a hardware issue, and there is no fix as far as I know via software. I don't want to even start talking about USB1 vs USB2 vs USB3, these are all architectures not USB ports.\n", "Q: overheating of GPU(Nvidia gefore 920m) and degraded battery life i have dell inspiron-5558(i5-5200;8GB DRR3 RAM;4GB Nvidia-Geforce 920M as well intel HD graphics) and i am using Ubuntu 16.04LT\nin my windows i had a battery life of around 4-5 hours reading pdf but now my battery after being fully charged works for about 100minutes. even my Laptop  is heating a lot i think it is because of GPU.\ni have researched alot installed latest nvidia drivers. installed bumblebee and power management tools but still it is consuming alot of battery on standby\nversions of nvidia drivers (i have tried all of them)\neven the command optirun is not working \nerror in running optirun\ni am not even sure nvidia is working or not or if its constantly on.\nregarding temperature i dont think any ScreenShot will work but it is pretty hot.\ni am not very good with linux. so please tell the commands along with the content of answers.

So I have been trying to mount my Samsung 3150f camera and I have been using a combination of these two tutorials: \n\n\n*\n\n*Detect and mount devices\n\n*Can't transfer photos from Kodak Easy Share C195 Camera\nbut when I enter lsusb I get this:\n*-usb\n    description: Mass storage device\n    product: Samsung Digital Camera\n    vendor: FUJITSU\n    physical id: 1\n    bus info: usb@3:1\n    logical name: scsi8\n    version: 0.00\n    serial: E00000000002\n    capabilities: usb-2.00 scsi emulated scsi-host\n    configuration: driver=usb-storage maxpower=100mA spe`\n\nThe second link has been really helpful but is telling me I should be looking for something like:\nBus 001 Device 009: ID 040a:0565 Kodak, Inc.\n\nI see the Bus info but the other two I am not sure if they are called something else? Or am I totally on the wrong track?\n\nA: Why should a tutorial about a Kodak camera give you a string to search for in a Samsung camera? Never mind. See product: Samsung Digital Camera\nOne interesting line is:  \nconfiguration: driver=usb-storage\n\nwhich tells you that your Samsung camera looks like a usb-storage device (mountable disk).  \nRecord the time (touch /tmp/now or write it down). Unplug your camera from your system, wait 10 seconds, reconnect your camera, wait another 10 seconds, and type dmesg -T in a terminal window. Look at the entries with times later than the time you recorded (ls -l /tmp/now). They will show you what the system thinks is going on when you connect your camera. One piece of information to look for is the device name (sda, sdb, sdc, etc), which will be useful in the mount command, if necessary (man -a mount).  \nWith the camera connected, use mount to see what is mounted, df to look at the space and where it is mounted, IF it auto-mounted.\nOnce you know the device name, you need to find out the partition type.  Type:  \nsudo fdisk -l\n\nand look for your device name.\nNow that you know the device name and the filesystem type (also known as fstype), read man mount, a couple of times.\n", "Q: how to create service out of command?

I want to make RAID to SSDs each other and 1TB HDDs each other.\nI searched a lot and tried many things, but I think I didn't successfully made it.\nIs there a easy way to doing this and how can I check if the operation succeed or not?\nI can't try these instructions, because I've already installed Ubuntu.\n\nA: ahmetertem.  I did this yesterday using the package \"mdadm\":\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo apt-get install mdadm\n\n*partition your intended drives (I let it default to ext4 for filesystem, and I used the package \"gparted\" for this, for your reference)\n\n*carefully note the device names of the drives you want to use (mine happened to be /dev/sda and /dev/sdc)\n\n*In Terminal:  sudo mdadm --create /dev/md0 --level-1 --raid-devices=2 /dev/sda /dev/sdc (Of course, you will use your own device names.)\nIt said something like \"device /dev/md0 created\" and the drives went nuts creating metadata, I assume.\n\n*format it:  sudo mkfs -text4 /dev/md0 (don't know if this is necessary, but it was when I first created RAID in 14.04.)\n\n*mount it:  sudo mount -text4 /dev/md0 /media/raid (that's where I wanted to put it)\n\n\nMy \"proper answer\" to your question ends here.\nAftermath and notes:\nAfter rebooting, I wanted to mount the raid but discovered it was already mounted.  (Wouldn't do that in 14.04 without tweaking the /etc/fstab file).  I couldn't find the raid in /media/raid, but instead discovered that it was already mounted -- but where?  I found it in /media/me (\"me\" is my home folder name) as 023023-2341324-1234324-234134243 or something like that.\nI tried to rename it, but the device was busy.  So, I unmounted it and then that long-name folder was gone.  Rebooted again.  It's back, and that long name is the same, so I tried changing the permissions and created a static link to it called \"raid\".  Still can't write to it, though, because of permissions/ownership troubles.\nI'm sure I'll work it out in about a day.

I am completely new to Ubuntu and I have recently installed Ubuntu by dual booting along side Windows 10. My laptop model is a HP ENVY 15-j100. It has built-in finger print scanner. I was trying to find the software for fingerprint scanner in Ubuntu and I found this: \nhttp://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2013/03/how-to-get-your-fingerprint-reader-working-in-ubuntu .\nIt said to type the following commands to get support for fingerprint-based authentication in Ubuntu as well as the related GUI:\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:fingerprint/fingerprint-gui && sudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install libbsapi policykit-1-fingerprint-gui fingerprint-gui\nIt had a warning that \"*It ought to be noted that the related PolicyKit package for the fingerprint stack will remove the default one (“policykit-gnome” , etc. depending on your environment) thus if you do decide to remove the fingerprint PPA, you must reinstall this package manually, or risk a broken system.\"\nNow I might just be paranoid, but I thought installing that software might harm my Windows fingerprint scanner drivers. So I wanted to know whether it will harm my computer? If yes, is there any other safe way to use the fingerprint scanner for my Ubuntu login also?\n\nA: It will for certain not harm your scanner itself or your computer, maximal your installation, but then www.omgubuntu.co.uk is a very popular site which is good maintained, and if there would be anything suspicious with the ppa itself people would have already put tons of comments on that below the article and the article wouldn't be there anymore.\nSo my verdict, it is safe to use, nowadays hardware can barely be damaged by software.

I am using an application with multithreading capability. I find that running the application with increasing numbers of threads improves run time until I go over a certain number at which point the run times start increasing again. This thread number is far below the number of cores that I have. Here are some examples (these are \"real\" times):\n8 threads: 1m45.992s\n16 threads: 1m7.494s\n24 threads: 1m45.174s\n32 threads: 3m10.819s\n40 threads: 6m12.194s\n80 threads: 25m22.937s\n\nI am not running out of memory (only 4 Gb of 128 Gb used) and no swap is being used. No other processes with significant CPU usage are running during these tests. \nInterestingly, when I run a version of same application compiled from the same source in OS X with the same data on my PowerMac with 8 cores, I get a steady run time improvement up to 16 threads with only minor (few seconds) slowdown at 32 and 64 threads, so I don't believe it's a problem with the application software. Indeed, when I use another multithread-capable application with similar function as the first on the Ubuntu server, I see similar, though not as dramatic results:\n16 threads: 4m4.795s\n40 threads: 2m31.430s\n60 threads: 3m7.007s\n80 threads: 5m6.946s \n\nI usually have to run these analyses sequentially on hundreds of data sets, so any gains in efficiency can make a big difference. My question is whether this may be related to a system software configuration problem vs. an issue with my hardware. Any thoughts on where to start looking to solve this issue and get the full benefit from all my processors would be greatly appreciated.\nThank you.\n\nA: You are probably hitting contention points in the code, such as locking (via futexes or the like) where serialization of the code occurs and hence stops the performance scaling.\nAlso, an x86 CPU may have N cores, each with say 2 threads each, but that does not give you 2 x N performance, since a hyperthread executes when certain execution blocks are available. I believe for a single socketed x86 processor one may get up to 30% extra performance with a hyperthread.\nAlso, you may be getting contention on memory, be it on cache (L1, L2 or L3) or even on the memory itself. So you may be hitting limitations on the throughput, cache stalls or on the TLB.\nWith N  process > N CPUs, you will end up with more processes than can be runnable, so the scheduler has to perform more work in pre-empting runnable processes and this is another penalty that eats into performance.\nYou can get low-level performance metrics using tools such as perf. Install it with:\nsudo apt-get install linux-tools \n\nAnd run you application with perf to get some performance measurements:\nperf stat your-program\n\nYou can do deeper analysis using perf record and perf report, e.g.\nsudo perf record your-program\nsudo perf report\n\nAlternatively, run your program and while it is running use perf top to get an interactive real time view of the system activity:\nsudo perf top\n\nHopefully that will give you some idea of where the bottle neck is occurring.\n", "Q: Cannot boot into Windows after Ubuntu 16.04 install I am unfamiliar with Windows UEFI and changed the BIOS to Legacy to get my Lenovo B50 to boot from a USB port to install Ubuntu. Now the only way I can boot is to use UEFI in the BIOS to boot Windows and change it to legacy to boot Ubuntu. How can I fix this? Thank you in advance for your input.\n\nA: On my system I use F2 for UEFI, F8 for Boot Options and F10 for recovery. Yours likely has a boot option, too. What this does, is when I boot using F8, it pulls up my Win Boot Loader, Ubuntu USB and Ubuntu Boot-loader partition. After installing 16.04 (and until I get this grub2 fixed) I have to boot with F8 and choose Windows or Ubuntu respectively to boot into mine manually. Note, I am unable to do this when Secure Boot is active, so use F2 (UEFI option) and disable Secure Boot and see what happens.\n", "Q: Desktop pinch zoom I am using Dell XPS 15 and have pinch zoom configured with Ubuntu Unity Tweak.

It's an HP notebook. After I close the lid it just shuts off the screen and stays on. It is set to suspend when the lid is closed but nothing happens. Everything is updated. Any help?\nSpecs:\n\n\nA: OK, try manually suspending it first, to see what's up:\nsudo pm-hibernate\n\nSuspend and hybernate have issues in 16.04 LTS at default kernel. Type uname -r to see which kernel you're using, probably 4.4.0.21 or 22. Doesn't work at this kernel with some laptops.

But now in Ubuntu 16.04 things don't work like that anymore for some reason... It doesn't find any programs other than I already have installed (not even GIMP or Adobe Flash Player...). \nAnd when I try to install program from website by opening it by default in Ubuntu Software it gives me the message: \"failed to open\". Can anyone help me out here? How can I install programs on Ubuntu 16?\n\nA: Canonical decided to pull the plug on the Ubuntu Software Center in version 16.04. The Ubuntu Software Center has now been replaced by the Gnome Software Center. You can still install software there just like when Ubuntu still had USC. \nI hope you find what you are looking for.

I didn't find any solution for the moment, can someone help me?\nThank for all. \n\nA: I am assuming you are located in the same local network with both hosts\nThere are several ways to do that.\n1. SSH & SCP\nAs both systems do know ssh & scp you could easily transfer files via scp.\nAs far as i know you have to enable SSH/SCP on the Mac via:\nSystem Preferences → Sharing → select Remote Login checkbox. \nUsage examples:\nscp /path/to/local/file remoteusername@remotehost:\n\nor for an entire folder\nscp -r /path/to/local/folder remoteusername@remotehost:\n\nin case you want to define the target position as well:\nscp -r /path/to/local/folder remoteusername@remotehost:/path/on/targetsystem\n\nSome additional help for scp can be found here.\n2. Shared Mac Folder\nYou could enable a Folder sharing in System Preferences → Sharing of the Mac.\n\nMacs usually share via AFP and optional SMB/CIFS.\nYou could then mount that share on the ubuntu side in Nautilus (or other File Manager) or permanently via /etc/fstab.\n3. Syncing folders\nSetup Dropbox/Owncloud or similar on both hosts and enjoy syncing files with all pro and cons.\nYou could as well use rsync to sync a folder between those 2 machines.\n\nA: A lazy FLOSS alternative to Dropbox/Owncloud (it is much easier to setup than owncloud) is syncthing. I use it to sync android and multiple Linux boxes (Ubuntu, openSUSE and Raspbian), but it also works on MacOS.\nJust always be sure to use the same version on all clients as the protocol changes over main versions.\nOf course using SSH & SCP or SFTP is probably closer to the question you asked.\n"]
