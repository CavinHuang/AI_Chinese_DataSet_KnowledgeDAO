["Q: How can I verify whether my OpenPGP key revocation was uploaded successfully? I just revoked my old PGP key using Enigmail in Thunderbird. I uploaded the revoked key and deleted it afterwards.\nNow I'm wondering, how can I verify that it is really revoked so that other users are getting informed about that.\n\nA: Just check an arbitrary server in the key server network. To specify a key, remember to prefix the key ID with 0x (which is expected by the SKS key server software for denoting key IDs). For example, my own key is found by searching for 0xa4ff2279.\nIf your revocation certificate is not visible (yet), don't worry: while the key servers synchronize with each other, this process takes some time. Usually in the range of minutes, but it could also take some hours sometimes. If you're not under time pressure, just check back tomorrow.\n", "Q: Turned off a server and on restart got a mount error Please could somone assist?\nWe have an error on a server restart when moving the server to a new rack.\nEnd of boot sequence is:\n* Starting configure network device\n* Starting Mount Network filesystems\n* Stopping Mount Network filesystems\n[ 56.172113] CIFS WFS: Error connecting to socket.

I am using Ubuntu 16.04. I must use Photoshop because of my job. I tried to use virtualbox but it's slower and there are some problems about shortkeys. I am thinking to use PlayOnLinux for photoshop but i worry about security. \nShould i install windows with dualboot or PlayOnLinux (wine) is secure enough for photoshop ?\nEdit: \"Security\" I mean about viruses. I have D partition old NTFS for backup files and i have external HDD it's NTFS too.\n\nA: You would likely have less problems with viruses if running Photoshop within wine for a few reasons.\n\n\n*\n\n*A virus might not behave like it would on a real operating system and therefore would do nothing to your wine environment.\n\n*Your wine environment is easier to backup/restore/recreate compared to reinstalling/restoring Windows OS.\n\n*Your program running on wine may run faster than running it on Windows, with an antivirus.\n\n\nThings you should be aware of and you should practice while running Photoshop in wine:\n\n\n*\n\n*Always use a working directory outside of the wine environment so that if you DO happen to get an infected file, you can restore your wine environment without losing your photos.\n\n*Run an antivirus check on your photos, or USB, before moving it to another machine or OS.  IF you happen to get a virus in wine and your photos get infected, it may not affect YOUR wine environment, but there's still a chance of passing on the virus through the photo files on the next machine. \n\n", "Q: What is the Ubuntu accessibility for blind people?

The dir would be the path to the headers you do want to use. If just including the proper directories doesn't work then it would be best to also disable the default include paths with --nostdinc but this shouldn't be needed since it searches the include directories first.

We've also confirmed that DNS lookups can be done outbound.  So we just need to make sure the system can always reach a DNS server.\nIn your /etc/resolv.conf and when you are connected to your VPN, there should be something like this at the very least (IP addresses may differ!) in the file:\nnameserver 127.0.1.1\nnameserver 8.8.8.8\n\nIf not, then we need to make sure you have a DNS server set so you can resolve domain names.  So, replace the contents of /etc/resolv.conf with the following (Google DNS):\nnameserver 8.8.8.8\nnameserver 8.8.4.4\n\nand then try and use the Internet normally over the VPN.\nIf you do this and it doesn't work because /etc/resolv.conf keeps getting overwritten, then you may wish to consider forcing it to be unchangeable with sudo chattr +i /etc/resolv.conf.  If you are absolutely certain that you won't have to change your DNS servers, then do not make this change, because you will run into issues with DHCP or such trying to set DNS nameservers and failing because nothing can edit /etc/resolv.conf.\n", "Q: How to setup and use the snap version UFW in 16.04 LTS?

Can I safely upgrade from Ubuntu 14.04 LTS to Ubuntu 16.04 LTS with respect to compatibility?\nThanks\n\nA: Upgrading distributions to a newer version rarely causes hardware support issues because in the kernel, support for hardware is rarely (if not never) removed, only added.\nIf you really want to be sure, try it with a live usb with 16.04 without installing it, that usually is a good indicator of what to expect when you actually install it.

Make sure you read the man pages for xrandr, especially for overscan and transform, because your settings are likely going to be different.\nUse xrandr --prop to see available settings and displays. Replace TV-1 with your display device.\nalias tvout='xrandr --output TV-1'\ntvout --off\ntvout --set mode NTSC-M\ntvout --set overscan 0\ntvout --set \"flicker reduction\" 0\ntvout --transform 1.0,0,0,0,0.75,0,0,0,1\ntvout --auto\ntvout --Left-of DVI-I-1\n\nThere is no harm in playing around with the transform settings.

When I go into LibreOffice writer and hold up a page to a screen, it is not the same size.\nIf I change the zoom to 117% they are the same size.\nHow do I scale the page size (and not the rest of the LibreOffice UI) so that 117% zoom would be shown as 100%?\nHow I did it:\nFirst, I calculated the new DPI: Current DPI/100*Scale, in my case it was 96/100*117=112.32. I then rounded down the resulting number (112). Then I went into the 'Startup Applications' setting and added this command: xrandr --dpi 112. Then I logged out, then went back in again to verify my settings were correct.\n\nA: You may have to adjust the dpi settings on OS level. There are different approaches how to do this, they are explained in some answers to \"How to find and change the screen DPI?\".\n\nA: I don't think that there's a way to do this, but you can set your measurements to mm/cm/inches or others and base your formatting around that.\nYou can add a vertical ruler by enabling it: settings: -> tools -> options -> LibreOffice Writer -> View -> Vertical ruler\n\nA: Note that if you have two monitors, they may have different DPI value. It might be non-obvious if the values aren't drastically different like HiDPI vs normal monitor.\nI, in particular, have a 1280 × 1024 monitor with 377mm × 300mm dimensions, which gives 86 DPI, to which the X server's DPI setting is set. But my second monitor is 1920 × 1080 with 477mm × 268mm dimensions, thus having 102 DPI.\nThis difference results in the virtual sheet matching the paper sheet in size on one monitor but not on the other. So be sure to set X server's DPI setting to the one of the monitor where you're going to display your LibreOffice Writer windows.\n", "Q: Compiling Cheese from source, fails to compile I am trying to install cheese from source, and Im not interested in finding a package, because I have source code changes I should like to apply, if I can get it to compile.

I don't fully understand what all the partitions are for:\n\nEdit: So the picture didn't come out clear: \n\nIn order: Device, Type, Size, Used, System\n/dev/sda1, ntfs, 104 MB, 32 MB, Windows 10(loader)\n\n/dev/sda2, ntfs, 400000 MB, 170205 MB, N/a\n\nunusable, 90999 MB, N/a, N/a\n\n/dev/sda3, ntfs, 471 MB, 337 MB, N/a\n\n/dev/sda4, ntfs, 8529 MB, 7493 MB, Windows Recovery Environment(loader)\n\n\nSo is it safe to delete sda3 (with 471 MB) or is there something I need to do to make the unusable partition available for Ubuntu to be installed onto?\nI experimented with removing sda3 and changed unusable to ext3, which worked, but it said I needed a swap area. I reverted it back to the way it's listed.\n\nA: I can help you with the problem. The partitions that you are seeing here are of NTFS format which is compatible with windows. For ubuntu, this wont work. You will have to create an EXT4 partition. You will get this option during installation. For linux systems it is necessary to create a swap partition for better performance. The biggest problem for you is the limit to the number of partitions you can have in one hard drive, which is 4. So layout is: \n1st partition - NTFS for windows \n2nd partition - EXT4 for ubuntu\n3rd partition - swap area\nIn your case, you can reformat your unusable space as ext4 for ubuntu. I cant see which of your partition has windows, most probably /dev/sda2. If thats the case then split your unusable space into an ext4 partition and a swap partition. Also while installing boot loader for Ubuntu, make sure you overwrite Windows bootloader which is /dev/sda1. Windows bootloaders create a lot of problems. Also can you tell me if your system has UEFI boot enabled or not? You can check this from bios menu. Let me know if you need any more help.\n", "Q: how to show first 2 and last 2 line of all the files whose name starts with “file” how to show first 2 and last 2 line of all the files whose name starts with “file”. with Command in ubuntu\n\nA: You didn't specify exactly how to do this, so here are two ways:\n\n\n*\n\n*Print the first two lines of all the files, then the last two lines of all the files.\nhead --lines=2 file*\ntail --lines=2 file*\n\n\n*Print the first two lines then the last two lines of each file in sequence.\nfor file in file*; do\n    head --lines=2 \"$file\"\n    tail --lines=2 \"$file\"\ndone\n\n", "Q: Necessity of Software Updates Is it necessary to run the command sudo apt-get update each time after installing any software/application?\nI know the use of this command.

Anyways,\nI have this series of voice recognition programs wrote in python, and I wanted to make a voice command that restarted these scripts using a bash shell, because bash and terminal are the controlling units of Ubuntu. Much like command prompt is for windows. \nI was wondering if there was a way to create bash files like windows dos files, and if there was a way to stop a python program \n\n\n*\n\n*without harming it, as in safely stop it.\n\n*restarting that same python program after stopping it.\n\n*Kudos for telling me how to start it again after a set amount of time.\n\n\nAny help is appreciated, and like always, is much needed. I know this might go under \"stack overflow\" but I honestly felt it was more suited here considering that is strictly for command languages, not really scripting languages, and especially Ubuntu user related questions. Once again, thank you.\n\nA: You can create new bash files simply with creating a new file and making it executable.\ne.g. \ntouch simplebash.sh\n\nnow add the shebang to the file so it knows in which shell you actually want to run the script.\nYou can do this with this simple echo forward or just simple edit the file with an editor  \necho \"#!/bin/bash\" > simplebash.sh\n\nChange the permissions so it is executable  \nchmod a+x simplebash.sh\n\nNow you can start writing your script/commands into the script and run it in the terminal with this.   \n./simplebash.sh\n\nThere are different ways but this is the simpliest.\nNow stopping your running python script is nothing more then sending the appropriate kill signal.\ne.g. kill 15 processname or pid is the soft way to tell the program please stop and clean up after yourself. Those signals are usually handled by the script/program themselve. If it doesn't react to any kind of signal you can send a kill 9 proccess name or pid which is a signal that cannot be caught by the program/script and means as much as terminate it.\n", "Q: Still apache page running after configuring nginx?

However, you cannot install Ubuntu on a Windows partition (C), you will have to either delete the Windows partition (which means that Windows will be completely gone and replaced with Ubuntu), or shrink the Windows partition in order to make space for an additional Ubuntu partition.\nDuring the installation, Ubuntu will offer you a choice of where to install it, and weather to replace Windows or install Ubuntu alongside Windows, choose \"Something else\" here:\n\nThis will give you something like the the following screen; although in your case you'll probably have fewer partitions:\n\nHere, you can either resize the main Windows partition and make it smaller, and then create a new Ubuntu partition in the free space, or entirely delete the Windows partition, and create an Ubuntu partition in the free space.

I am not sure about commands that make requests instead of searching data in the local cache.      \nAlso, what is the difference between apt-cache search and apt search? I can guess they both use the local cache.   \n\nA: You are right that apt-get update reads from the sources (online) and the other commands apt-get search and apt-get install read from the cached information. From man apt:\nupdate (apt-get(8))\n       update is used to download package information from all configured\n       sources. Other commands operate on this data to e.g. perform\n       package upgrades or search in and display details about all\n       packages available for installation.\n\nThe difference between apt search <package> and apt-cache search <package> is that the output of apt search is fancier (has colours, alphabetically organised, has nice line separation for easy reading) because apt is a fancy new interface. This is explained well in this answer on the difference between apt & apt-get\nHowever, search isn't the only thing you can do with apt-cache:\nUsage: apt-cache [options] command\n       apt-cache [options] show pkg1 [pkg2 ...]\n\napt-cache queries and displays available information about installed\nand installable packages. It works exclusively on the data acquired\ninto the local cache via the 'update' command of e.g. apt-get. The\ndisplayed information may therefore be outdated if the last update was\ntoo long ago, but in exchange apt-cache works independently of the\navailability of the configured sources (e.g. offline).\n\nMost used commands:\n  showsrc - Show source records\n  search - Search the package list for a regex pattern\n  depends - Show raw dependency information for a package\n  rdepends - Show reverse dependency information for a package\n  show - Show a readable record for the package\n  pkgnames - List the names of all packages in the system\n  policy - Show policy settings\n\nThis is from the info page for apt-cache\napt combines commands from apt-get and apt-cache, so you can get the same or slightly fancier/tidied up output from any of the apt-cache [option] <package> commands with apt [option] <package> eg\napt show gimp\n\ndisplays almost exactly the same as \napt-cache show gimp\n\n", "Q: Why does memory usage shown in System Monitor differ from that in ps_mem?

I have to hold Fn + Alt + F4 to work.\n\nA: As it won't.\nFn does not appear on keyboard layouts because as far as the operating system is concerned, it does not exist.\nThe Fn key is handled entirely by the microprocessor in the keyboard.  Knowledge of it is not sent over the wire.  There's no USB HID \"usage\" denoting it.  It has no PS/2 scancode.\nThe keyboard's microprocessor uses the current Fn shift state (incorporating any \"Fn lock\" or latch) to determine the usages/scancodes that are sent over the wire for other keys, including the keys that double-up as both function keys and (say) multimedia keys.  This is why you needed to press Fn+F4 to actually get F4 sent over the wire.\n(In a number of modern keyboard microprocessors, there are four maps from physical keys to usages/scancodes, one for each of the four combinations of current Fn shift state and NumLock LED (sic!) state.)\nFor some keyboards with Fn keys, the manufacturer also provides a vendor-private USB output mechanism for setting the sense of the Fn shift state.  This mechanism is what your firmware's SETUP utility is invoking, and what utilities like the Lenovo Keyboard \"Driver\" invoke on Windows.

I have a remote rsync backup to a server running over ssh, using NAT to specify a non-standard high numbered port on the router.\nIs it ok to only open the port on the router, and the ssh port on the server, to TCP connections, or is use of UDP required?\n\nA: SSH does not use UDP.\nUDP is only used by alternative implementations like mosh.\n", "Q: Choosing which download to have Is it possible to download ubuntu 16.04 for an i3 based machine which doesn't connect to the internet by first downloading to an amd based machine and then creating a bootable usb? (The download page detects the amd and starts to download the version for that, so I need to be able to choose one suitable for an i3 processor and get that one, I already have ubuntu on the amd machine).\n\nA: AMD64 is just another name for the x86_64 CPU architecture. Points relevant to you:\n\n\n*\n\n*Your CPU supports it. There a no 32bit-only Intel i3s.\n\n*It's faster than i386, often demonstrably.\n\n*Less relevant these days is that 64bit applications do use slightly more RAM. But you can have more directly addressable RAM. And RAM is cheap.\n\n\nOn balance, 64bit is the clear winner these days.\nGet that, ignore that it says AMD in the arch name. It's just a name.\n", "Q: How to write efficient script to have memory (RAM) peak? I have a network with some PCs. I wanted to have peak of the memory for each system. \nI wrote a script to check the used memory and writes the peak in a file in /tmp; and I've set the script to run in background when the system boots. But it seems that it uses much resources as top shows about 2 (of 8 for 8-threaded CPU) when it runs.\n#! /bin/bash\ntouch /tmp/mempeak\n\nwhile true\ndo\n     A=$(free -m | grep \"Mem\"|awk '{printf \"%.2f\",$3/1000-$NF/1000}')\n     B=$(cat /tmp/mempeak)\n     A=$(awk -va=$A -vb=$B 'BEGIN {print (a>b)?a:b }')\n     echo $A > /tmp/mempeak\ndone\n\nI wonder if there is another way to have this value in an efficient way.\nPS. The memory peak should reset as the system restarts and should be accessible from remote server by ssh\n\nA: Your script is using a lot of CPU resources because it runs continuously, which is inefficient. To avoid this, add a call to sleep, which means that it will only do it's work once every 5 seconds, which is a lot more efficient. You can probably extend this to even more, like 60 seconds, depending on how frequent / accurate it needs to be.\nHere's what it looks like with that extra sleep 5:\n#! /bin/bash\ntouch /tmp/mempeak\n\nwhile true\ndo\n     A=$(free -m | grep \"Mem\"|awk '{printf \"%.2f\",$3/1000-$NF/1000}')\n     B=$(cat /tmp/mempeak)\n     A=$(awk -va=$A -vb=$B 'BEGIN {print (a>b)?a:b }')\n     echo $A > /tmp/mempeak\n     sleep 5\ndone\n\nIf you want to avoid excessive disk writes (e.g. to reduce SSD wear), you could change your script so that it only writes to disk when the value actually changes, and maybe put the output file on a temporary in-memory filesystem as well.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 16: google-chrome-stable : Depends: libappindicator1 but it is not going to be installed I installed Ubuntu 16 desktop a few weeks ago. Added Chrome and all fine. However now when I try sudo apt-get install ffmpeg, I get this error message:\nReading package lists... Done\nBuilding dependency tree       \nReading state information...

Try 'apt-get -f install' with no packages (or specify a solution).\n\nWhat's the problem and what should I do?\n\nA: You can run sudo apt-get -f install, as suggested by the error message. This should install any needed dependencies and resolve the issue. (Alternatively, you could use Synaptic, Aptitude, or another package manager to resolve the dependency issue.)\nAs @grooveplex pointed out, the -f stands for --fix-broken, not \"force\", and should not cause any damage to your system.\n\nA: Google chrome is not available from Ubuntu repository, instead setup is downloaded from Google's servers.. you should be able to install libappindicator1 using sudo apt install libappindicator1 (it's in the 16.04 repository) or from synaptic package manager, and then try installing the chrome.deb \n\nIf you do not have synaptic\nsudo apt-get install synaptic\n\nOnce the libappindicator1 is in place, Open the .deb in Ubuntu Software Install as shown on Google Chrome's download page\n\nA: What helped me with installing libappindicator1 on Ubuntu and in Docker as well - is installing this package manually.

So the first line of your script should be #!/bin/bash. This is a good convention to get into, it is how bash scripts should be written. Your script currently works when you run bash /home/backupscript.sh because you're already telling it to run a bash shell with the bash part of that command. You could perhaps get round this by making your crontab line:\n0 4 24-31 * 4 bash /home/backupscript.sh\n\nThis is not the correct way to do this, as it skips the permissions on the script, though it would work.\nMost likely you don't have the correct permissions on your script, you need to set the execute bit. This is the domain of the chmod command, instructions on how to use it can be found here.\nIf you want anyone on your system to be able to execute this command you can run:\nchmod +x /home/backupscript.sh\n\nThough you may want to restrict access to just your user, assuming your user created the script, which would be:\nchmod u+x /home/backupscript.sh\n\nMy advice is to add the shebang to the beginning of your script, and change the permissions to make it executable.\n", "Q: HDD+SSD Dualboot Setup Questions I have a Samsung Gaming Series Laptop that is about 3 years old running 16.04 that I tried to upgrade from 2 750GB HDDs to a 1.5 TB 5400 RPM HDD for Storage and a 500GB Samsung Evo 850.\nI hit a brick wall here, and most of the info concerning SSDs is more than two years old.\nRight now I have a running Ubuntu with partitions all over the place, each with their own mount point. /home, /var and /tmp are on HDD, root and /usr are on SSD. Windows is intalled fully on SSD, because I use it only for gaming (shame on me, but GTAV and Skyrim on Wine would be a pain).\nWhile Windows boots in about 5 seconds, Ubuntu needs up to two minutes, which is not what I got a SSD for.\nSo which directories are save to put on the SSD?\nSome say I should limit writes as much as I can, some say modern SSDs are fine with loads of writes. \nNow where should I put which partitions? \nCan I move /home to SSD? \nMaybe with links to a bigger HDD Folder for files that don't need to be on the SSD? \nWhich steps should I take to optimize for performance and longevity?\nAnd are there any things I should be super cautious about?\n\nA: \nSo which directories are save to put on the SSD?\n\nAny directory you want on it. I would advice the whole system and store your private data on a partition on the HDD. \n\nCan I move /home to SSD?\n\nYes. I myself only put the directories in /home/$USER/ onto a partition. Since those directories are maintained from a config file (~/.config/user-dirs.dirs) I keep a copy of that on the partition and on re-install copy it over the new one.\n\nWhich steps should I take to optimize for performance and longevity? \n\nAll I would worry about is \"tmpfs\". I'd move those into RAM. And make sure \"trim\" is enabled/working. \n\nAnd are there any things I should be super cautious about?\n\nI am prepared for the SSD to fail. And that preparation is: have an SSD in the cupboard still in its packaging, install the disk. Install Ubuntu on disk. Mount partitions. Copy /discword/user-dirs.dirs to ~/.config/user-dirs.dirs. Install some extra software. \nTakes about 30 minutes in total. \n", "Q: Windows 10 and Ubuntu 16.04 LTS dual boot problem Some time ago I upgraded to Windows 10 and wanted to give Ubuntu a try as well. \nAfter the installation when I restarted my computer I have the options to choose from. When I choose Ubuntu everything is fine and after switching my computer off and on again I have this options again.\nThe problem occurs when I choose Windows boot manager. My windows 10 loads up I do my stuff etc.. When I switch it off and on again I do not have the options available to me and Windows 10 loads up automatically.\nAlso when I go to advanced system settings to set the default operating system to Ubuntu it is not on the drop down list, only Windows appears.\n\nA: You can try to get your GRUB back instead of going with third party tools like EasyBCD.\nFirst Disable Fast startup on your windows. To do so :\nOn your windows 10,\nopen command prompt as administrator and execute powercfg /h off\nNow, Go to Control panel --> Power Options --> Choose what power buttons do (its on Left side) --> \"Change Settings that are currently unavailable\"\nand remove the tick mark on \"Fast startup\" \n\nThis disables fast start up on windows (Which is mandatory on dualboot).\nNow reboot.\nyou should see your Grub. nice and clean. \nNOTE :\nIf you have already tried EasyBCD you may have messed up your boot loaders. If so do this:\nGo to your Multi-boot manager during startup ( On HP notebooks Keep pressing f9 as soon as you power on your machine, f12 on Dell notebooks ) and manually boot to Ubuntu.\nOR \nRestart after doing the above steps. Go to your BIOS.\nGo to boot section and Under Boot loaders (Or similar) and bring the \"Ubuntu on HDxxxx\" option above Windows boot manager. \nOR\nNow reinstall grub by running the following commands :\nsudo update-grub\nsudo grub-install /dev/sda\nsudo update-grub\n\nThats it.\n\nA: Two methods-\nFirst:\nTry the software \"EasyBCD\" , it lets you choose the default OS. \nSecond:\nAnother thing that you can do is press escape button when you switch on your machine, press escape before any logo appears, you shall see few options, select the one that says \"boot device options\" or something similar to that, that should give you the list of OS available. \nP.s second one works just fine on my PC but I am not so sure about yours. Give it a try.\n\nA: It could be a problem with windows hibernation. When windows 10 goes to shutdown it \"helpfully\" hibernates instead. to stop that behavior just hold-down shift while you press the shutdown button. If that doesnt work, try booting from the live cd and running boot-repair. to access it just run:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair && sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y boot-repair && boot-repair\n\nthis will fix many grub2 problems.\nsource: ubuntu community support wiki, askubuntu.com\n\nA: I too would recommend EasyBCD ( http://neosmart.net/EasyBCD/ ). It supports Windows 10 now. Just install it while you are in Windows 10, choose which all operating systems you need while start up ( it will auto recover 16.04 ) and use the boot menu provided by it.Let me know if you have any further issue.\n\nA: This solution may be specific to my 2016 HP laptop. \nYou do need to turn off hybernate and fast start for other reasons - see fast boot explained but in my case, it still booted directly to Windows. I installed EasyBCD but was then informed that Linux is not an option because my machine is booting in UEFI mode - see Enable Legacy Boot Mode. \n(Note: There is no need to reinstall windows or purchase fix software as suggested in some articles.)\nIn the BIOS menu, I simply enabled legacy support and disabled secure boot. This made the Startup menu available (via ESC) which allowed me to select ubuntu under boot device options.\nIf I want ubuntu I need to press ESC at startup, otherwise I suppose it reverts to UEFI and Windows.\n\nA: In my HP laptop 2018, the problem is that Ubuntu is bootable but Windows 10 is going to sleep. I used boot-repair.\nAfter that, press Esc while you are entering Windows 10. \n", "Q: How to convert multi-catalog Ubuntu ISO image to boot it on Macbook 2,1?

I'm an ex developer of GRUB.\nWhat is probably happening is that grub-mkconfig fails to detect the modules necessary for you /dev/sdc1 . It is not a problem if you driver does not contais your /boot (where grub stores it modules) or the kernel files to boot.\nPlease share your /boot/grub/grub.cfg as well\nChange the value of GRUB_TIMEOUT to 10\nWhat is the output of sudo fdisk -l what is the filesystem in sdc1?\nat grub prompt type c (to enter shell) and type ls what drivers it shows to you?\n", "Q: Error when copying public key I have created a key pair in Xubuntu 15. I want to copy the public key to a Windows 10 laptop in order to allow ssh connection only from there, but when I run (as root):\n  ssh-copy-id myuser@my.ip.x.x\n\nit returns after a while:\n  /usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: attempting to log in with the new key(s), to filter out any that are already installed\n\n  /usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: ERROR: ssh: connect to host my.ip.x.x port 22: Connection timed out\n\nI have the windows firewall open for port 22, and allowed ssh_key application to communicate through the firewall. In Ubuntu I have ufw allowing all outgoing communications.\nThe laptop is not connected to the local network, is that a problem?\n\nA: You say in your question that you have ufw allowing all outgoing connections. Adding a key would be an incoming connection in my mind. Run the following command on your server to open port 22 for incoming.\nSudo ufw allow 22\n\nThen restart ssh\nSudo service ssh restart \n\nAnd try to import your key again. Also you may want to consider moving ssh to an alternative port.\nLog in to your router and make sure you have port 22 forwarded to the correct internal ip. Also if you are connecting externally, verify that your ISP is not assigning you dynamic ip address'. Otherwise the address will be consistently changing and you will then need to use a service such as dyndns. \n\nA: ssh-copy-id wants to communicate with a SSH server (sshd on Linux). The SSH server listens to port 22. Ensure that you have an SSH server running on the target (Windows) system, and check its logs.\n", "Q: How to show keyboard chart of a specific layout variant from command line?

There are 4 GiB of installed RAM in 2 modules. Sometimes the BIOS detects the whole 4 GiB, sometimes just 2. I have exchanged the modules several times, so I don't believe one of the modules is broken. I was suggested to run memtest, which I did, and as you can see in the picture, after having finished a first pass in almost 2 hours, it didn't detect any errors.\n\nI marked 3 points in the picture: 1, 2 and 3:\n1: 2048M - 3070M    1022M of 4093M: the only thing I understand is 4093M (4 GiB RAM, my total ammount of RAM. What do the other numbers indicate?\n2: Please notice this is a dual core laptop (2 DUO CPU), this has to do with question 3.\n3: If my laptop is a dual core one, why does memtest show: cores: 1 Active / 1 Total (Run: All)? shouldn't it indicate 2 total? and if it is running All, well, memtest is only detecting one core out of two, and something is wrong with my laptop.\n\nA: Question 1. RAM \nIt is suggested that you read this message carefully.\nIt says;\nTesting 2048M - 3070M :  1022M of 4093M\nThis means that currently MemTest is testing memory block from 2048M to 3070M which is of 1022M size. Hence it says 1022M of 4093M. No issues here.\nQuestion 2 and 3.  CPU\nCore 0 (SMP disabled) means it is using Core 0 (first core). SMP for symmetric multi-processing is disabled meaning it will not use multiple cores. This is not a problem.\nNext and importantly, you should NOT depend on the MemTest86+ for CPU core counts. This is memory testing library and it just uses CPUs to execute this testing. For truly checking CPU details, when running Ubuntu, go to terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T),\nand run,\nlscpu\nYou will get something like this;\n\nAnother command is nproc (this gives total processing units, depends upon hyperthreading). Since your CPU does not have hyperthreading this will report the total cores.\n\n", "Q: Clementine Play Count on Aquaris M10?

But I like more to use only the arrows to navigate.\n\nA: There are two possible reasons I can see for this happening.\nFirst, Eclipse running in Ubuntu by default uses the GTK3 graphics API.  This does not work properly.  You have to disable it until the suite of issues around this is resolved.\nThe following has some information about this: How to work around Eclipse Luna/GTK bug 339174 (change to not use oxygen) .\nSecond, you didn't mention this, but I see this particular symptom in my Ubuntu VM running in VirtualBox in full-screen mode.

I have my own VPS (Ubuntu 16.04) obviously with static IP so I was thinking to tunnel my connection to client's server through my VPS. Preferably using FireFTP if possible. The only access I have to clients server will be FTP (possibly SFTP) and I can get my IP (my VPS's IP) to be added into the white list. \nThe problem is I am quite new to SSH (I own the VPS just for a few days) and SSH Tunneling seams to me quite higher level and my case seams to be quite specific.

How can I modify partitions to I can install 3rd distribution\n\n\nA: UPDATE: Can't create more than one extended partition (thanks @ByteCommander), so creating a primary partition would still work in this case.\nThis would be my course of action in your case:\n\n\n*\n\n*Start up a LiveUSB and open gparted. Alternatively, if your /dev/sda6 partition is bootable and can run gparted, you can do this operation from there too.\n\n*Shrink /dev/sda1 by however large you want your new installation to be.\n\n*Create a blank ext4 partition in the free space you just took from /dev/sda1. Install to this space here.\n\n\nSo one thing I would suggest is creating a partition dedicated to hosting your /home so that you don't have to have multiple copies or links to your personal files between operating systems. This would also free up some space.\nIf you wanted to do that, just split the free space between an ext4 partition for /home and another ext4 for your new OS. There are other guides on Ask Ubuntu on how to move /home into that new partition. It is extremely helpful to do, and you keep a lot of customization and settings that you had from the other OS systems.\n", "Q: Why does launching my own script from a launcher only work once?

Running KodiBuntu (Lubuntu 14 ?) and I want to mount some shares from my windows computer. I have them mounted in /media/ using fstab and it works fine as long as the Windows machine is on when ubuntu boots. But if the Windows machine goes down, I have dramas with my other mounts and if the Windows machine isn't on when uBuntu boots, nothing gets mounted.\nIs there anyway to mount the share regardless of whether the Windows machine is on or not and perhaps just show a empty folder with write permissions denied for all or something?\nThank you :)\n\nA: To mount your share with Linux\nFirst of all, you can add the nofail option in your fstab line, so that the system does not complain if it does not find your network share. If that happens, you will have to manually mount after booting your windows machine, for example with a sudo mount -a.\nBut there is another approach that I tend to advise in such cases : use autofs. Instead of mounting your shares at boot-time, it mounts them when you try to use them, and unmounts them when you don't.\nThe following should work in your case. Please note that I chose to mount everything under /mnt instead of /media, because /media is usually used for dynamic mounts (I would not advise to use it for permanent mounts or autofs).\nFirst remove (or comment) your line in fstab, then install autofs :\nsudo apt-get install autofs\n\nCreate your parent directory :\nsudo mkdir /mnt/smb\n\nthen modify /etc/auto.master to add a line like this one :\n/mnt/smb /etc/smb.auto --ghost\n\nAnd create a file /etc/smb.auto with a content like this one :\nwindowsserver -fstype=cifs,rw,username=myuser,password=mypass ://windowsserver/share\n\nThen restart autofs\nsudo service autofs restart\n\nAnd try to browse the content :\nls -al /mnt/smb/windowsserver\n\nIt should mount the share automatically at the moment you try to use it. If mounting fails (for example because your server is off), you will see an empty directory (and \"Host is down\" error messages, at least on command-line). Then, if you start your server you should be able to access your files automatically (without the need to ssh on your kodibuntu).\nSee https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Autofs for more details.\nTo mount your share with Kodi\nIf you're using Kodibuntu, there is another option, which seems a lot easier, and probably more suitable : instead of mounting your share at the OS level, Kodi is able to access network shares by itself.\nThis can be done through the user-interface of Kodi : see http://kodi.wiki/view/Adding_video_sources#Adding_Remote_sources\n", "Q: \"Hash Sum mismatch\" on google-talkplugin Very recently now, Google's repositories have been updated to fix the weak hash issue.

The problem I'm running into is that as soon as I enter the command, the progress report pops up, getting in the way of the password prompt so I can't continue with the transfer. How do I fix this?\nHere's the code I've been using.\nFirst I tried this:\nsudo dd if=diskimage.img | pv -s 7340M | sudo dd of=/dev/disk2 bs=64k\n\nAs soon as I hit enter the progress pops up, so the password prompt is filled with that text.

So your solution is this:\n# become root\nsudo su\n# do your stuff\ndd if=diskimage.img | pv -s 7340M | dd of=/dev/disk2 bs=64k\n# get back to your normal user account\nexit\n\n", "Q: Which IDE's run on Ubuntu 14.04 and work for Brightscript Development? \nRoku BrightScript is a powerful scripting language that makes it easy\n  and quick to build media and networked applications for embedded\n  devices.

The shutdown was initiated from the Unity interface. The graphical interface became unresponsive. CTRL+ALT+F1 provided a login prompt. I was able to login and run the shutdown --poweroff now command but it reported that it would be running a destructive operation and failed to obey the command as per some policy. I could use some suggestions for debugging this further. \n\nA: I see it too. The problem started after allowing nvidia updates. While I backtrack on that, I will tell you the only solution I've found\nRun\nps aux | grep suspend\n\nyou should see a root-owned suspend process. Then kill that process:\nsudo kill -9 xxxx\n\nwhere xxxx is the number of the job.\nWarning: the PC will suspend immediately when you do this, and then when you try to wake up, you are likely to be in an incoherent situation and it is best to reboot.\n\nA: I found that the inability to shutdown only occurred when a suspend/resume had been performed during the session. However, ps aux | grep suspend did not give any results. It appears that the shutdown issue was related to another issue in 16.04 LTS whereby the swap partition encryption is not working. I filed the details in Launchpad Ubuntu Bug #1594035. Ultimately, I just disabled swap and deleted the swap partition. Encrypted swap is broken and it is interfering with suspend/resume/shutdown.\n", "Q: Recover Partition Table for exFAT Partition I unplugged my USB stick from Ubuntu 16.04 without the save remove option, but exfat should be fine doing so. No read write was happening, the partition does not use journaling. What I end up with is an unmountable USB stick with checksum error. \nWhat tools are there to recover the partition table or at least the data on the USB stick? What I am doing now is scanning via parted. Has anyone experienced the same problem with exfat and recovery options? Unfortunately parted probably won't detect the partition because it does not support exfat.\nI also tried to use Partition Wizard on Windows but it failed to detect anything, just showing unallocated space. How do I proceed? are there helpful tools under Windows or Ubuntu?\n\nI also tried to use gpart -v /dev/sdb but it failed to detect anything. On OS X there is a tool called fsck_exfat, is there any on Windows?\nupdate\nThe disk is preinstalled with Parted Magic.\nAfter quick search no partition shows up. \n\nA: \nexfat should be fine doing so. No read write was happening, the partition does not use journaling\n\nThe fact that the file system does not use journaling is the exact opposite of \"being fine\" removing a drive without unmounting it properly. ;) The OS can't easily fix inconsistencies because there is no such journal.\nUse TestDisk\nBriefly, your drive still has a partition table and the file system type shows up correctly as exFAT, as seen on your screenshot. Install TestDisk and run it on the device:\nsudo apt install testdisk\nsudo testdisk /dev/sdb\n\nI have discussed this tool before here on AU, and you might also be interested in the TestDisk guide.

So, when I open Firefox on Lubuntu, no matter if it's from the Desktop shortcut (.desktop) or from the Terminal, instead of opening the Firefox right away in maximized it first goes half the screen height and THEN maximizes. So there's some sort of a lag.\nOf course I've tried setting the width and height parameters, e.g. firefox -width 1280 -height 1024 and the \"maximize\" parameter firefox --window --maximize. None of those worked.  \nSince Lubuntu is meant for low performance hardware, I think hardware isn't an issue.

I noticed there's a new version of Gnome system monitor while my version is 3.18.2. I tried to remove and reinstall it but I still have the same version.

How can I keep the shares available after logout, or what did I wrong?\n\nA: I found the solution myself and I want to share it with you:\nIn the past, I entered my known hosts only in the /etc/hosts file.\nAfter entering the same into /etc/hosts.allow file everything works fine.\n", "Q: Cannot install Ubuntu 16.04 on Dell XPS 9550 -- grub-install /dev/nvme failed I just got my Dell XPS 9550 laptop, then I installed fresh Windows 10 Pro x64 on it, shrinked the volume for Ubuntu, and tried installing Ubuntu 16.04 via USB stick from ISO. \nI did the install alongside Windows option, clicked next and it installs more than halfway, then it error out with this:\nUnable to install GRUB in /dev/nvme.\nExecuting 'grub-install /dev/nvme failed.\nThis is a fatal error.\n\nI have the following settings in BIOS: Legacy boot, AHCI, Secure Boot off.\nLaptop configuration: i7-6700HQ, 16GB DDR4, 512GB Samsung P951 NVMe SSD, FHD screen.\nScreenshots:\n\n\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated.

My goal is to be able to start ubuntu without any screen connected. I also want to rotate left.  \nActually if I start my DP or HDMI monitor after boot I can't get it worked. X server can't start.  In the past I had Nvidia graphic card and it was possible with the parameter allowemptyinitialconfiguration. For my intel card I tried with a dummy interface but it always displays black screen when my monitor is on.\nMoreover, if I plug and start my monitor before booting ubuntu I have display working but rotation doesn't keep after switch off and on the monitor.    \nI tried using monitors.xml in ~/.conf/ but this solution only works for one vendor and model of display. I'd like to make it works for any display.\nAnother solution I found is to use udev rules to detect change and execute a script which will use xrandr to configure rotation. This solution seems to work but sometimes it doesn't rotate.  \nThis is the output of xrandr --verbose & ls /sys/class/drm/*/edid | xargs -i{} sh -c \"echo {}; parse-edid < {}\"\n/sys/class/drm/card0-DP-1/edid\nPartial Read...

The following 63 sectors were the BIOS compat region that contained the grub stage 1.5.  So, in all there were 64 * 512 (or 32K) reserved at the start of the disk.  Nowadays, the reserved region after the MBR is 2047 sectors; I believe is so there is enough space to allocate a UEFI boot partition there at a later date if it has not been installed already.\n", "Q: hp stream 11 wifi works after reboot but disconnects after sleep and won't reconnect I have a new HP Stream 11 with rtl8723be driver (lwfinger version with antenna select) with Linux Mint 17.3 (ubuntu 14.04) installed in place of win10.\nWifi works after reboot, and works fine while I'm using it.

I almost always use VLC for watching a video.\nThanks!\n\nA: If I understand you correctly, you would like to extract the local videos you're watching, not things like Youtube? \nIn that case, you might want to have a look at the Gnome Activity Journal. It tells you what you've watched and when you did it, by time and date. This is accomplished using Zeitgeist, for which there is a library for Python if you want to do specific things with that data. This is also the same system that's used to display what files you've used in Unity Dash. If you're not aware of it, there is a special tab in the dash that shows you the last files you've used and you can search. I did that only a few hours ago, when I wanted to see which episode of the Family Guy I watched last. So I just did Super+F and entered \"family\". If you want to remove entries from the log, you need Gnome Activity Journal, or you make something yourself, of course. \nZeitgeist also stores which apps you've used to open these files, so you could for instance choose to display which files you've ever opened with VLC on Thursday afternoons during the last three months. \nZeitgeist is a really nice tool, that's severely under utilized. More apps, scripts and high-level tools, are very welcome. If you make something cool, do share! :)\nEDIT: I found a link that I think you might be interested in. It's a little old, but Zeitgeist shouldn't have changed much since then. http://bloc.eurion.net/archives/2012/zeitgeist-python-api-tutorial/\n", "Q: Chrome launcher icon right click menu doesn't show option for opening new window I installed google-chrome-stable by following instructions from here.

I'm planning on buying a 4k monitor, but have heard about some applications, (in general all operating systems) may not be ready for 4k which results in a very bad user experience. \nI mostly use standard applications (office, internet browsing, eventually gimp, etc... ) and developing applications (netbeans, mysql workbench, android studio...). \nI'm currently running 16.04, Unity desktop. \n\nA: This german article says that it was running without issues. The author describes that he was changing the scaling factor under the system preferences and that the scaling was set systemwide for all used fonts. \nA unconvenience was the size of the mousecursor, which was corrected in /etc/X11/Xresources/x11-common by modifying Xcursor*size: 48. \nHe also describes a problem when the system goes into energy saving mode, that it doesn't come back on, but this seems to be an issue with Display Port\nIn libre office, gimp and firefox the author changed the scaling within the program to a fitting scaling size.\n\nA: since I've investigated quite a bit about the topic recently, I think I ought to answer.\nThe short answer is: Ubuntu 16.04 with Unity is ready for 4k, with many limitations and various hardware restrictions.\nIf you want to stay sure you won't get serious issues, I'd go for a desktop computer with a single 4k monitor; make sure you install a recent Nvidia GPU with DP1.2 output. I have personally tested this setup with an Nvidia GTX 750, binary nvidia driver, DP output, single Philips BDM4065UC 4k monitor, and it works totally fine 3840x2160@60Hz ; you can pick 1.5 or 2.0 monitor scaling (aka 'retina adjustment'), depending on your taste. I've found everything was smooth and working without issues.\nWhat I've found much harder to work with is:\n\n\n*\n\n*multiple monitors: especially if they're different and especially if you'd like a different scaling on different monitors; dragging windows around such monitors creates strange bugs. Maybe with identical 4k monitors the situation is better, but I wasn't able to test such scenario.\n\n*laptops: I've yet to find a recent laptop working properly with an external 4k monitor (see Which laptop for Ubuntu 16.04 with 4k external monitor?), but many have succeeded at working properly with internal 4k monitors (e.g. I've heard about success with Dell XPS 9350 QHD).\n\n\nUPDATE FOR 18.04\nI'd say that stock 18.04 is a bit less 4k ready than 16.04. I suppose that Unity worked a bit better than Gnome with HiDpi. In 18.04, you can only choose between 200% and 300% scaling, scaled images look blurry, and some apps will just fail to pickup the scaling setting; also, the desktop feels quite laggy when scaling is enabled, even when using a dedicated GPU (both NVidia and AMD graphics was tested), and most window menus and icons will look blurred or pixelated when using scaling. A step back.\nOn the other hand, AMD GPUs seem to work out of the box with no proprietary driver. I tested RX550 and RX560, they worked properly with a LG 43UD79B monitor.\n\nA: I have brought a machine with 4k display(Dell inspiron 7548). I got it with windows fully featured with touch screen. But i am pure techie, and my requirement was either ubuntu or centos. So i tried ubuntu 16.04 and its working fine with most of features.\nPlus point :\n\n\n*\n\n*Screen looks awesome with 4k display\n\n*Touch Screen is working fine but not full functional. \n\n\nMinus : \n\n\n*\n\n*Screen rendering is not good. \n\n*Not able to play videos in full screen mode.\n\n*Could not open images over facebook.\n\n\nA: it depends entirely upon your graphics card and firmware.\nI have a geforce gtx 750ii card with the nvidia driver from the ubuntu repositories. excellent 4k experience for videos and gaming. \n\nA: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS is more than 4K ready. I see no blurry icons even on lots of proprietary apps (unlike Xubuntu or Manjaro, which have horrible 4K support). Application window frames are properly scaled. Applications detect the scaling well, too. Haven't seen an unscaled app yet.\nBe aware of the performance it requires though. I have a laptop with Intel i7 CPU with built-in graphics and I can tell you that web browsing whether on Firefox or Chrome, is definitely not fluent. Firefox's performance is a bit better though.\n", "Q: help me understand files and blocks count on booting On booting my laptop, right after BIOS is loaded I see on my screen:\n/dev/sda1: clean, 116918/19275776 files, 66284199/77094912 blocks\nI have two questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*If I'm seeing that information, is it a sign that something is dying/already broken? It started appearing 3 days ago.\n\n*The first number to the left of the forward slash for both files and blocks it's with each booting different (I mean 116918 and 66284199). What do those numbers indicate? Is it a problem?\n\nA: This is the output of a filesystem check at boot for the /dev/sda1 partition. fsck (actually probably e2fsck if it's an ext4 filesystem, which is the default for modern Ubuntu installations) is the program which carries out the checks. This is set to happen after a configurable number of reboots, or after a certain time period. It can also be triggered if you had to switch your computer off without properly shutting down, such as if you had to shut down by holding the power button in.\nThe piece of information that is most relevant is the word 'clean', which indicates that everything's in working order. So there's nothing to worry about.\nThe files and blocks part of the output show how many of the available files and blocks are in use. The files part actually applies to inodes, which are the underlying filesystem location for a file. So you're using 116918 out of the 19275776 available files spaces, and 66284199 of the available 77094912 blocks.\n", "Q: How can the Ubuntu phone screenshot sound be turned off? I have set the phone (Aquaris E4.5) to silent, but taking a screenshot (up and down volume buttons) still produces a sound. How can this sound be turned off? I'm on Ubuntu 15.04 (OTA-10.1).\n\nA: Unfortunately it is a bug. As an ugly workaround you may press and hold the down volume button until the volume slider goes to zero before taking a screenshot.\nHere's another related bug.\n", "Q: formatting/partitioning: Ubuntu installer vs GParted vs gnome-disks utility Ready to format/partition a 120GB SSD that has been securely erased by use of hdparm and install Ubuntu Studio 16.04 (currently running from a live USB).\nShould this be done via the Ubuntu installer itself , GParted or the gnome-disks utility perhaps? Are there any pros/cons? \n\nA: The recommended/easiest way is to boot Ubuntu (Studio) from the live USB and either simply let the automatic installer (install Ubuntu 16.04 and let the installer do the partitioning for you) or, when it asks you how you want to partition, click 'Something Else' and use the installer's manual partitioner that comes up. Naturally I would expect that you would know what you're doing if you take that option!\nI think you can also try running GNOME Disks from the Live USB if you want to try that. And you might be able to install Gparted to the live USB to run that (apparently you need to select 'stored in reserved space' when creating the live USB via Startup Disk Creator to do this) or you can use Gparted Live to partition the SSD beforehand, but this is more complex.\nReally, just use the installer. I can't give any proper run-down on pros and cons (you'll need to wait for someone else to answer if you want that) but I can say that using the installer to partition is recommended and probably easiest.\nIf you have any serious problems (by this I mean a proper issue, not \"I don't like how the installer does this\") with partitioning with the installer, then try and reproduce the problem by running the installer after clicking 'Try Ubuntu' (instead of 'Install Ubuntu) at the start and running the ubuntu-bug ubiquity command in Terminal preferably after reproducing the bug (make sure you've connected to the Internet). Then the developers can try to fix the bug.\n", "Q: Is scrolling down Facebook web page causes high CPU usage normal? \n\n\n*\n\n*CPU: Intel i5-2400 \n\n*RAM: 8GB (dual channel)\n\n*No graphic card\n\n\nI've tried the command below but it didn't work for me.\nsudo echo > \"options drm_kms_helper poll=N\" > /etc/modprobe.d/local.conf\n\nPlease can you guys help me solve this problem? \nDoes Facebook page in new tab share the same CPU resource with others?\nIf this is true, how to separete them from using the same distributed CPU resource?\nThe information below retrieved by command line sudo '/usr/bin/intel_gpu_top' when I keep pressing page down button on the keyboard in browsing Faceook web page for testing the GPU status.\n render busy:  12%: ██▌                                    render space: 12/131072\n            bitstream busy:   0%:                                     bitstream space: 0/131072\n              blitter busy:   1%: ▎                                     blitter space: 0/131072\n\n                      task  percent busy\n                        CS:  11%: ██▎                     vert fetch: 7542782 (1686/sec)\n                       GAM:  11%: ██▎                     prim fetch: 2756058 (592/sec)\n                     EU 00:  11%: ██▎                  VS invocations: 7512722 (1683/sec)\n                     EU 10:  11%: ██▎                  GS invocations: 0 (0/sec)\n                     EU 11:  11%: ██▎                       GS prims: 0 (0/sec)\n                       PSD:  11%: ██▎                  CL invocations: 2738436 (590/sec)\n                     EU 01:  11%: ██▎                       CL prims: 2746022 (591/sec)\n                     EU 12:  11%: ██▎                  PS invocations: 462796763240 (101142779/sec)\n                     EU 02:  11%: ██▎                  PS depth pass: 462802984040 (101142779/sec)\n                        IZ:  11%: ██▎                  \n                        SC:  11%: ██▎                  \n                       HIZ:  11%: ██▎                  \n                      WMFE:  11%: ██▎                  \n                        MT:  11%: ██▎                  \n                       SVG:  11%: ██▎                  \n                      WMBE:  11%: ██▎                  \n                     RCPFE:  10%: ██                   \n                     RCPBE:  10%: ██                   \n                       RCC:  10%: ██                   \n                       DAP:  10%: ██                   \n                        PL:   8%: █▋                   \n                      IC 0:   8%: █▋                   \n                      IC 1:   8%: █▋                   \n                        TD:   8%: █▋                   \n                        SO:   8%: █▋                   \n                        SI:   7%: █▌                   \n                        FL:   7%: █▌                   \n                      SVRW:   7%: █▌                   \n                        FT:   6%: █▎                   \n                        DG:   6%: █▎                   \n                      SVSM:   5%: █                    \n                        QC:   5%: █                    \n                        DM:   3%: ▋                    \n                        SF:   0%:                      \n                        CL:   0%:                      \n                       ISC:   0%:                      \n                       VS0:   0%:                      \n\n\nA: In Firefox you can disable \"smooth scrolling\" which saves RAM and CPU.

I can set the screen resolution manually once I log in using the following command:\nxrandr -s 1360x768\n\nbut I am not able to make it \"stick\". Every time I log back in, the resolution for a little while changes to 1360x768, but by the time the desktop appears, switches back to 800x600.\nI have also tried other versions of the command, if that matters. For example, xrandr --output Virtual1 --mode 1360x768. It works as long as I don't exit the current session, but switches back to 800x600 when I log back in.\nI have tried the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Placed the command in a /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf, but this causes the entire GUI to fail to appear.\n\n*Edited ~/.xprofile to run the command to set the screen resolution, but this doesn't work.\n\n*Installed open-vm-tools and made sure it is up to date.\n\n*Disabled 3D acceleration in the VM's settings as was suggested in another answer. This made no difference at all.\n\n*Added the xrandr command into my ~/.bashrc. This causes the correct resolution to be set everytime I open up a terminal, but this solution is kludgy. I don't want to have to open a terminal to have my screen resolution properly set.\n\n\nAny ideas what else could be done?\nThanks in advance!\nEdit: I am using VMware Workstation 12 Player, version 12.1.1 (build-3770994) \n\nA: Changing the resolution requires the VMWare Tools, or the open source equivalents.  I've found the Open Source versions to work a little better than the compile-them versions that ship with VMWare Workstation.\nInstall the Open VM Tools, with the following commands.  Note that if you've installed the VMware Tools already you need to uninstall those first.\nsudo apt-get install open-vm-tools open-vm-tools-desktop\n\nOnce this is done fully shut down the VM, then start it up again in Workstation.\nYou can then see a larger set of resolutions in the GUI as you would for a standard computer, or use VMware Workstation's \"Autofit Guest\" and \"Fit Guest Now\" options with the Desktop Open VM Tools to autoadjust the resolution.\nThis is confirmed working on VMware Workstation machines, as well as VMware ESXi virtual machines accessed via VMware Workstation, on Ubuntu, Lubuntu, Xubuntu, and Kubuntu 16.04 LTS machines that I personally have been running, and it works nearly flawlessly (make sure you give enough vRAM to the VMs, because it takes the Video RAM from that virtual RAM allocation you give by default...)\n\nA: I wrote here before, a clean install of ubuntu has no problem with resolution. But after that I found the solution while I was looking for an answer for another problem. \nFollow the steps below and everything will be fixed. If you have the latest VMware Tools and open-vm-tools is not install, the skip to step 3.\n1) sudo apt-get autoremove open-vm-tools\n2) Install VMware Tools by following the usual method (Virtual Machine --> Reinstall VMWare Tools)\n3) Reboot the VM\n4) sudo apt-get install open-vm-tools-desktop\n5) Reboot the VM.\nHope this helps. I know how frustrating it is to try and fix this. \n\nA: If you are using Ubuntu on VMWare Workstation, you need to install VMWare tools to get proper resolution.\nHere is the step by step procedure to do that :\n\n*\n\n*Start your Virtual machine and login to your Ubuntu.\n\n\n*Go to VM --> Install VMWare Tools...\n\n\n\n*Click on install\n\n\n*Now you should see a Virtual CD named \"VMWare tools\" mounted in your Ubuntu. Copy the VMWareTools-xx.xx.xx.xxxxx.tar.gz  to your home Directory .\n\n\n*Extract it\n\n\n\n*Go to the extracted folder in a terminal :\n cd ~/vmware-tools-distrib\n\n\n\n*Provide execution permission for vmware-install.pl\n chmod +x vmware-install.pl\n\n\n\n*Execute it with superuser privileges .\n sudo ./vmware-install.pl\n\n\n\n*Enter your password. When asked for confirmation type yes and press Enter. If you wish to install with default settings, keep pressing Enter for the next messages, which are :\n\n*\n\n*While doing the below procedure Press Enter when asked \"Need to create..... This is what you want ?\"\n\n\n*Default Directory /usr/bin\n\n\n*Default Directory containing init directories /etc\n\n\n*Default Directory with init scripts : /etc/init.d\n\n\n*Default Directory Demon files : /usr/sbin\n\n\n*Default Directory for library files : /usr/lib/vmware-tools\n\n\n*Default Directory for common agent library files : /usr/lib\n\n\n*Default Directory for common agent transient files : /var/lib\n\n\n*Default Directory for documentation files : /usr/share/doc/vmware-tools\n\n\n\n\n*Press Enter when asked if you want to invoke /usr/bin/vmware-config-tools.pl\n\n\n*Press Enter for all other queries.\n\n\n*Now restart your Ubuntu.\nSetting proper Resolution.\n\n*\n\n*After restart, go to System Settings --> Displays --> Resolution and select your preferred resolution and click Apply and  followed by Keep this Configuration\n\nThats all ;-) . Restart and you will see its 1366x768 by default :-)\n\nA: I had the same problem, annoying but finally fixed using a variation of the first suggested answer above.  \nI'm running Ubuntu 16.04.3 on Fusion 8.5.8 with HW version 12. \nWithin Fusion display settings:\n\n\n*\n\n*\"Use full resolution for Retina Display\" should be checked \n\n*\"Use Fusion Display Preferences\" set for both \"Single Window\" and \"Full Screen\".\n\n\nFusion is running on MacOS 10.12.6 on MacBook Pro with Display Preferences set to \"Default for Display\"\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo apt-get autoremove open-vm-tools\n\n*Install Fusion's VMware tools as root\n\n*Reboot\n\n\nI noticed after the reboot everything looked perfect, came back up with my 1920x1200 resolution but continued with the suggested final steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo apt-get install open-vm-tools-desktop\n\n*Reboot\n\n\nCame back up with the tiny 2560x1600, changed and saved to my preferred resolution and logged out and back in (actually just jumped back to my Mac desktop and back again as that would revert the settings as well) and Ubuntu reverted to the 2560x1600. \nSo the final fix while in this state (running only VMware's tools with open-vm-tools-desktop) is the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo apt-get autoremove open-vm-tools-desktop\n\n*Run an install of VMware's tools over the existing (step one removed some required libraries and drivers)\n\n*Reboot\n\n\nWorks like a charm and so far haven't noticed anything missing or lost functionality due to not having the open desktop tools installed, seems that VMware's tools give you everything you need and works. \n\nA: Like you, I can't find any way to get it to run on startup, but I did find a way to get it to run on login which was \"good enough\" for me.  I added this to my ~/.profile:\nxrandr --newmode \"1600x900_60.00\" 118.25 1600 1696 1856 2112 900 903 908 934 -hsync +vsync\nxrandr --addmode Virtual1 1600x900_60.00\nxrandr -s 1600x900\n\nYou should be able to do the same for your resolution:\nxrandr --newmode \"1360x768_60.00\" 84.75 1360 1432 1568 1776 768 771 781 798 -hsync +vsync\nxrandr --addmode Virtual1 1360x768_60.00\nxrandr -s 1360x768\n\nIt no longer seems to work on 18.04, though (it changes and then immediately switches back).

Just remove the v.\nThen you have grep -P '\\S'. \nThe -v flag means: \"show only lines that don't match the pattern\"\n\nSome alternative commands:\n\n\n*\n\n*grep -v '^$' Pattern matches \"begin of string (^), directly followed by \"end of string\" ($)\n\n*grep -v '^[[:space:]]*$' same as before, but with optional space in the line (not really empty, but nothing visible)\n\n*grep  '[^[:space:]]' greps all lines that contain a non-space character (basically the same you used but does not need the -P option)\n\n", "Q: String Manipulation var=\"<string> 1.11 </string>\"\n\nI want to get rid of  <string> and  </string>\nHow can I do it?\nFor now i got this:\nvar=${var:9:4}\n\n1.11\n\n\nA: You could use sed for string manipulation:\necho '$var = <string> 1.11 </string>' | sed -r 's/<string>(.*)<\\/string>/\\1/g'\n\nreturns\n$var =  1.11 \n\nExplanation of the sed construct:\nsed -r                       # call sed with regex-option (-r)\n  's/                        # begin of regex (s means \"replace, / is the seperator)\n     <string>(.*)<\\/string>  # construct that should be replaced (the / has to be escaped with \\ here)\n   /                         # seperator\n     \\1                      # replacement string (\\1 means \"whatever is matched between the () before\")\n   /g'                       # apply replacement globally (in case it occurs multiple times in the string)\n\n\nA: I'm using another solution:\necho '$var = <string> 1.11 </string>' | awk -F'> | <' '{print $1,$3}'\n\nWhat I did was defining > and < as delimiters and printing certain fields between the delimiters. \n\nA: Bash has also its own regular expressions.

I'm looking to learn to code in C and would like your opinion on what would be the best operating system for a laptop. \nI have an older 'Dell' laptop, which is very slow, but I've seen reviews that say Ubuntu gave their old Windows PC's a new lease of life. \nI'm considering bringing this old one back to life as a dedicated Ubuntu terminal.\n\nA: On the new one choose some of the 16.04 release for better UEFI and hardware support. At the old both 14.04 and 16.04 will be good.\nPERSONAL OPINION\nI use my favorite flavor Ubuntu-MATE 16.04 on both my old laptop with 32bit single core celeron CPU/2GB RAM/intergrated GPU and my desktop with fx-8150 8-core CPU/8GB RAM/AMD HD 7750 GPU. Just disable the compositor from MATE tweak at the old one and choose compton or compiz for better visual effects at the new one.\nIf your laptop is too old then go for lubuntu (greate performance but I stop using it because it has several bugs in my opinion) or xubuntu (used it for 2 years and it is very stable, its only a bit lighter than mate, disable the compositor at the old laptop if you choose it).\nI hate all Ubuntu-GNOME (with gnome desktop), Kubuntu (with KDE) or Ubuntu (with the default Unity desktop) and I think Ubuntu-MATE has nothing to be jealous of them :P\n", "Q: show specific lines from all files with .txt extension How can I print specific lines (say the 7th and 15th) of each file in the current directory whose name ends in .txt?\n\nA: There are many ways. Here are a few:\n\n\n*\n\n*awk\nawk 'FNR==7 || FNR==15' *.txt\n\nFNR is the line number of the current file. Because the default action in awk when an expression evaluates to true is to print the current line, this will print lines 7 and 15 of each .txt file. \nAwk is the only tool I know that can easily (others can do it but not quite so simply) distinguish between the line number of all input and the line number of the current file. Therefore, the other suggestions involve shell loops:\n\n\n*\n\n*sed\nfor f in *.txt; do sed -n '7p;15p' \"$f\"; done\n\n\n*Perl\nfor f in *.txt; do perl -ne 'print if $.==7 or $.==15' \"$f\"; done\n\nOr, to avoid the shell loop:\nperl -ne '$c++; print if $c==7 or $c==15; $c=0 if eof' *.txt\n\n", "Q: cp -Rdfp $source/* $dest/ wont copy .htaccess This command wont copy .htaccess files:\ncp -Rdfp $source/* $dest/ \n\nThanks\n\nA: In bash, the * glob doesn't include hidden files ('dotfiles') by default - you can enable that explicitly by setting the dotglob shell option e.g.\nshopt -s dotglob\ncp -Rdfp $source/* $dest\n\nYou can unset the option after with shopt -u dotglob. \nAlternatively, if $dest does not already exist, the much simpler\ncp -Rdfp $source $dest\n\n(avoiding the glob altogether) should work as well.\n", "Q: Graphical MS-SQL Clients for a Ubuntu Desktop I occasionally need to do minor edits to a MS-SQL database running on one of our servers...\nI'm using an evaluation of DbVisualizer at the moment to do this (it's Java based and uses something called the jTDS JDBC driver to talk to MS-SQL)... trouble is it's expensive and I'm wondering if there is anything else I can use.\nI'm preferably after something which is either a native application (or Java, Python, Perl etc...) but not Windows/Wine/Mono.  \nSomething which has a similar UI to MySQL Workbench or DbVisualizer which I'm currently using.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: I use DBeaver. There is a Debian package (.deb) available on their website. It is similar to MySQL Workbench.\nTo install: download the .deb file from the download page, change to the directory you put the DBWeaver deb in and run sudo dpkg -i dbeaver-*.deb or run sudo snap install dbeaver-ce for snap users and run sudo flatpak install flathub io.dbeaver.DBeaverCommunity for flatpak users.\n\nA: The simplest way to install dbeaver in Ubuntu:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:serge-rider/dbeaver-ce\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install dbeaver-ce\n\nRun the dbeaver:\ndbeaver-ce\n\nAfter to install it, you can create a shortcut in desktop area using the option Create Laucher and typing the \"dbeaver-ce\" in command field.\n\nA: SQL Operation Studio, runs on Windows, MacOS, and Linux.\nA great review is here on RedGate website. What is great is that now there is an extension for SQL Profiler, also the intellisense and document format are great. \nI quote from their website:\n\nSQLOPS is the new open source, multiplatform tool for working with SQL Server. We began by seeing how easy it is to install, then showed the interface. Next, we looked at some common tasks such as editing queries, then reviewed the cool snippets feature. Finally, we looked at how to ‘peek’ into your database. Although still in preview, SQLOPS already has many features that make it a worthy addition to your toolkit.\"\n\n\nA: For developers who are using Visual Studio Code on Ubuntu, another option would be to install the SQL Server extension: \nhttps://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-mssql.mssql\nThis extension allows you to access multiple SQL server databases, run queries and scripts directly from the IDE, as well as perform other operations and tasks. \nFor simple use cases, I've found this to be a quick and easy option for MS-SQL access on Ubuntu, without the need for installing separate software.\n\nA: *\n\n*You can use SQLOps, now also called Azure Data Studio. You should be able to get it here :  https://aka.ms/sqlopsstudio  : and run it on Windows, Mac, or Linux.\n\n*Run SSMS on a completely different machine and connect to the machine and SQL Server instance that you want to control.\n\n*Install Oracle's Virtual Box on the server machine, install Windows inside VirtualBox, and SSMS within Windows. Then connect SSMS to your server instance ...\n\n\nA: Sqlectron is an open-source, cross-platform SQL client with a clean, simple GUI that supports Microsoft SQL Server (along with PostgreSQL, MySQL, Cassandra, and SQLite).\n\nA: Looks like there are a few other too as well as DBeaver..\nSQuirreL SQL Client\nSQL Workbench/J\nGot to say though I do prefer DBeaver as it downloads required drivers for you and has a .deb package ready made.\n", "Q: Add a repository for security testing I want to use some security tools because I study security (A total beginner). I tried adding the repos of kali, and install some security tools from there, the security tools works great but I had some problem later with installing some packages from the official Ubuntu repository (like wine), problems like E: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages.\nSo is there a repository especially created for Ubuntu for security pen-testers and that won't cause any problems with the official Ubuntu packages ??\nI know that some of you will tell me to go to kali, but I just can't, I am too attached to Ubuntu.\n\nA: I found a great tool to install pentest tools on Ubuntu. It's name is Pentesters Framework (ptf). \nYou can install It from this link , and see this link for a  description.\n", "Q: How to see information of a WiFi hotspot I once tried to connect to? I would like to see some information, including MAC address, of a WiFi hotspot that I tried to connect to and failed in the past.\nI can not try connecting to it again any more, because it is not a hotspot that is in range, but one that I noticed and tried to connect to once.\nAre there logs for this? Where can I find them?\nAdding to this: I need to be able to find and identigy the network or device again even if they changed their name. From what I've read the UUID is assigned by NetworkManager to the connection, and the MAC address it stores is my MAC address, not the address of the network I tried to connect to. Is there any way to see information in the logs about the target network? Is it possible to extract a MAC address out of the UUID or something like that? I really need this.\n\nA: The log will be found in /etc//NetworkManager/system-connections. Here, for example, is a slightly redacted listing from my machine:\nsudo cat /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/MMMB\\ Wi-Fi\n\n[connection]\nid=MMMB Wi-Fi\nuuid=3ab72ecb-9f3f-4642-82eb-15b0ff90819a\ntype=wifi\npermissions=user:chili:;\nsecondaries=\n\n[wifi]\nmac-address=XX:3D:82:7A:FE:XX\nmac-address-blacklist=\nmac-address-randomization=0\nmode=infrastructure\nseen-bssids=\nssid=MMMB Wi-Fi\n\n[wifi-security]\nauth-alg=open\ngroup=\nkey-mgmt=wpa-psk\npairwise=\n\n", "Q: Where does git/ignore live? http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/wily/man5/gitignore.5.html\nI'm trying to follow these directions, but when I go to my .config folder there's no git folder. I've used git many times already, but now I want to find the ignore file.\n\nA: The .gitignore file is a per project file and/or a per subdirectory file, located in the root directory of the project and/or various subdirectories of the project. For example, for my kernel git clone:\n~/temp-k-git/linux$ ls -l -a .gitignore\n-rw-rw-r-- 1 doug doug 1280 Jun 13 15:29 .gitignore\n\nThere are also 187 other .gitignore files in various subdirectories of the project.\n", "Q: How to send a file from my computer to my phone using KDE Connect? I made sure that the Share and receive plugin of KDE Connect is enabled and the software installed both on my Android phone and my Ubuntu 16.04 laptop. \nHowever, I can't find how to send a file from my laptop to my Android phone.

Make certain your wireless router has your mac address if it has a mac control  firewall (can block non-listed mac addresses from accessing through the router). Also, you want to be certain that your password entry is flawless (tiniest mistake and your router will not allow you to connect) and you can do so by typing it in a text editor (but do not save it), hold Ctrl (control) and hit \"a\" (Select all is what that does) while holding the ctrl, then once it is highlighted press (while still holding ctrl) \"c\" (Copy is what ctrl and c do).  Go back to the passcode entry window any click inside to ensure you're in the entry point and press cntrl \"v\" (paste is what ctrl v does).  Then your password will be exactly what you typed in the text editor (which you can immediately close once you've entered (pasted) the password into the network password window).  This solved the problem with my HP HDX18 at least. Hope it works for you also.\nRespectfully,\nDavid\n\nA: Have you contacted your university's IT dept?

How can i install apps into Ubuntu phone by USB? Is there any method to download phone apps into desktop (MAC or Ubuntu) and then install them into phone by USB?\n\nA: The simple answer is that you can't.  Apps for the phone are in click packages.  The only simple way to install them is from the Ubuntu Store on your phone using a WiFi or a mobile data connection.\nYou can install click packages, if you have them, using USB (see Having generated a webapp with the generator, how do I test my click on the device?) but there is no publicly available place you can get them from.   \n", "Q: Snappy sharing resources and updates I have 2 questions about snappy (which I absolutely love!) that I wanted to ask. I hope it's OK I am merging them into one thread :) \n\n\n*\n\n*Sharing resources\nMy first example snap build is a java server I developed. I managed to create a snap that contains the jre, my server and the service startup. Everything works fine. \nThe snap file results in 106MB which is mainly java. I was wondering if there is a way to share the java installation between servers? So that my snap files become very small only containing specific code for my installation? \nIn my head this would sort of look like this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Snap 1: A snap that contains the Java runtime and exposes java for others to use. I believe slots are used for that, but I am not 100% sure on that.\n\n*Snap 2: Server A that only contains my jars and uses the java runtime of Snap 1.\n\n*Snap 3: Like Snap 2 but with different jars. \n\n\nI would have Snap 2 and 3 depend on Snap 1, so that if someone installs Snap 2, it would automatically install Snap 1. If Snap 1 is installed, it will skip that and simply use it? \nI am not sure if this is supported or if this is even meant to work that way? \n\n*Update mechanism.\nI read that snappy supports transactional updates. I read that as \"if the download or installation breaks, the update fails and the previous version will run as expeceted\". \nI wonder if the update is a append-update. I am having deployment environments that have limited connectivity, so it would be cool if the update worked in an rsync manner. E.g. the update starts downloading, gets to 20% and then the connectivity breaks. It retries after a while and once the connectivity is back up, it picks up where it left. \nIs this something that is implemented/works? \n\nA: Trying to answer your merged questions:\nQuestion 1: This mecanism isn't available as of today (we may introduce one in the future, with the 3 separated snaps as you infer, but this isn't available now).\nAnother option you can seek if, if snap 2 and 3 are tightly coupled, you can have one snap containing the jvm, and your 2 services. Then, some configuration to choose what to start (service 1, service 2 or the two of them).\nQuestion 2: This isn't the case nowdays, however, I encourage you to file a bug to request such a feature as a bug on launchpad.\n", "Q: \"No network connection\" in Lubuntu 14.04 About 3 days ago my wife did an update using software updater on her Packard Bell dot-s notebook running Lubuntu 14.04.

I have recently upgraded my PC from Lubuntu 14.10 to 15.10. Before the upgrade my keyboard layout matched my Danish keyboard.

Unfortunately I don't have much know-how so maybe the following has changed more than you would want, but I haven't experienced any problems myself. \nSolution adapted from Meuh's answer: https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/307767\n\nA: Some googling and a test led me to this:\nRight click the panel -> Add / Remove Panel Items -> Add -> Keyboard Layout Handler\nThat adds an icon to the panel, and by right clicking it and selecting \"Settings\", a GUI tool for managing keyboard layouts shows up.\nTo add languages, \"keep system layout\" should be unchecked. \n\nA: On Lubuntu, complementing solutions above: Right-click on the bottom panel, and add the Keyboard Layout Handler.\nAt this point it only handles \"US English\", and the US flag appears (can be changed to text).\nTo add support to the US International (with dead keys), right click on the flag and enter to Settings.\nIn the Keyboard Layouts frame, click +Add. A nice list with flags of all countries in the world is displayed. Select US English again, but observe the diminutive triangle shaped icon to the left of it: it will expand to a rather complete list of variants, one of which is the wanted US Intl. with dead keys.\nYou can pick the key combination to activate it (I use Right Alt). Once installed you can also click on the flag icon in the panel: each click toggles the layout.\nNow you have the wanted layout, in my case I frequently write in Spanish on a US keyboard. Apostrophe+vocal gives you the accents, also the ñ. áéíóúü.\n\nA: As previous tries did not solve the problem, here is a workaround:\necho \"setxkbmap -layout dk\" >> ~/.xsessionrc \n\nReferance: https://wiki.debian.org/Keyboard\n\nA: *\n\n*In Lubuntu, open up a terminal window with ctrl-alt-t\n\n*type sudo apt install lxkeymap\n\n*type your password\n\n*close terminal window\n\n*click on the startbutton, preferences, lxkeymap\n\n*click on your country in the left column\n\n*click on your keyboard choice in the right column\n\n*click Apply\n\n*you can test how the keys work in the line at the bottom of the lxkeymap window\n\n*close lxkeymap window\n\n\nFor me, having bought a laptop with an English keyboard, but being a Dutch user, so wanting to be able to type \"e for an ë, the combination of United Kingdom and English (UK, international with dead keys) works fine. Before that the combination of United States and English (US, international with dead keys) worked fine.\n\nA: Had a similar problem with the german qwertz keyboard in a Lubuntu variant for eeepc.\nAfter some search I installed the Lxkeymap tool. \nIt adds the missing selection options to the LXDE GUI.\n\nA: Why not just edit  /etc/default/keyboard and change XKBLAYOUT to whatever value you want to set(dk, gb, us etc).

That lets you do a fresh reinstall of ubuntu on your hard drive again.\nThe reason doing a routine software update causes this problem is because for some reason a cryptswap1 thing was demanding a password to allow the updater to do stuff, and unless you have “Details” enabled in the software updates, the updater would skip some important stuff and you’d end up with a broken system. To do the update right you have to watch the “Details” tab and supply a password (can be any string you just have to type something) each time cryptswap1 asks for a password. Then use one of the other answers on this website to get rid of cryptswap1 for good.\nHope this helped\n", "Q: Intel video black patches 16.04 I'm new to Ubuntu and have just installed 16.04 on my laptop.

Pretty simple, I am trying to change the runlevel. Everything I find online points me to the file located in:\n/etc/init/rc-sysinit.conf\n\nHere I have tried changing the \"DEFAULT_RUNLEVEL\" to 3 or anything else and it makes no difference (the original value was 2 which didn't make much sense either). No matter what, my machine boots fully and when I check the runlevel command, I see \"N 5\" as the result every time.\nHow do I change the runlevel? I would rather not override it through grub or some other workaround mechanism. And I am not looking for how to disable X specifically.\nAll the instructions I was finding online were a bit old, did something change with 16.04?\n\nA: Ubuntu 16.04 uses systemd instead of init and hence the concept of runlevels is replaced by the term targets. So there is indeed a mapping between init-based runlevels and systemd-based targets:\n   Mapping between runlevels and systemd targets\n   ┌─────────┬───────────────────┐\n   │Runlevel │ Target            │\n   ├─────────┼───────────────────┤\n   │0        │ poweroff.target   │\n   ├─────────┼───────────────────┤\n   │1        │ rescue.target     │\n   ├─────────┼───────────────────┤\n   │2, 3, 4  │ multi-user.target │\n   ├─────────┼───────────────────┤\n   │5        │ graphical.target  │\n   ├─────────┼───────────────────┤\n   │6        │ reboot.target     │\n   └─────────┴───────────────────┘\n\nNow, to just change the \"runlevels\" in 16.04, you can use for eg:\nsudo systemctl isolate multi-user.target\n\nTo make this the default \"runlevel\", you can use:\nsudo systemctl enable multi-user.target\nsudo systemctl set-default multi-user.target\n\nFrom man systemctl\n   isolate NAME\n       Start the unit specified on the command line and its dependencies and stop all others. If\n       a unit name with no extension is given, an extension of \".target\" will be assumed.\n\n       This is similar to changing the runlevel in a traditional init system. The isolate command\n       will immediately stop processes that are not enabled in the new unit, possibly including\n       the graphical environment or terminal you are currently using\n\nAlso have a look at man systemd.special to know more about the targets in systemd.\n", "Q: How can I encrypt all my internal drives on install and mount them at start? I have more than one physical hard drive in my computer and I want to encrypt them all on a new installation of 16.04, so that no data can be read from outside the operating system.\nHowever, it is important to me that they still function like unencrypted drives when Ubuntu is started and my user account is logged in. (That means, not having to mount and unlock them constantly, but rather on system start like an encrypted home folder or crypt-swap.)\nWhat would be the best way to do this?\nEdit:\nSince it is possible to encrypt the system drive at installation and have it unlocked at the splash screen, I guess the only thing left would be to encrypt all other drives individually (which can be done with the GNOME Disk Utility and then add the decryption information to the keyfile that is called to unlock the system drive somehow. Then, all drives would be decrypted at start. Unfortunately, I don't know how the backend of this system works at this point.\n\nA: I suggest VeraCrypt.  VeraCrypt is a port of TrueCrypt but is still maintained.  It uses substantially stronger encryption than TrueCrypt ever did.  You can download VeraCrypt here.\nFor your stated purpose, you're going to want the command-line version, so install that.  Then you'll want to encrypt with a long and impossible-to-remember randomized passphrase.

I've got 2 subs in 2 different languages for a video.\nOne is synced, the other has all the right lines but wrong timing [NOT fixed nor progressive delay]: the easiest thing would be changing the timings of the latter with the ones from the former, kind of copy paste time codes.\nWhich subtitles editor for Ubuntu has the capabilities to accomplish/would be more suited for this task?\nEDIT: Unfortunately there's no fixed delay, such that moving the subs by a certain amount of time could do it. They are simply wrongly synced (and that doesn't have to do with framerate either).\nI need an editor which can kind of copy and paste the \"timing\" column beside the \"text\" column\nEDIT 2: please people be civilised and read before marking as a duplicate. I'm not looking for a general sub editor, I'm looking for one with a particular feature NOT even mentioned in the question you would like to redirect me to.

If that’s the case then I’m fairly sure that I have a solution.\nIf you have a recent distribution of Ubuntu, then you have ImageMagick. You can check for it by typing just the word “convert” into your terminal. If you get several screens of usage information then you have it. If not, you may want to look for it on the Software Center.\nAssuming that you have ImageMagick, open your terminal, navigate to the directory where you image file is and type:\nConvert “filename” –colorspace RGB  “newfilename”\n\nWhere “filename” is the name of your image and “newfilename” is what you want to call the modified version. \nNow try opening “newfilename” in eog and let us know what happens.\n\nA: I had the same problem. It occurs in the Ubuntu Image Viewer (Eye of Gnome - eog) and also in its fork Eye of Mate (eom). The xprop -root -remove _ICC_PROFILE code also solves temporary my problem, but it also returns after the computer is suspended or turned off.\nSolution:\nI solved it (in Ubuntu LTS 20.04.4) going to Settings -> Color and disabling the Laptop Screen option (maybe another option might appear to you, so I recommend try each and see if it solves the problem). Your printer colors profile might be here too, so make sure to let disabled only the option that solves your problem.\nWarning: I don't know all the consequences of this change, but it's unlikely that something dangerous occurs (like you getting a black screen).\n\nA: There seems to be a problem with color management.\nAs far as the sample screenshot is concerned: it would be helpful to know whether the original file comes with a color profile included, maybe the creator intended that it looks that way. Or it's in a different color space than sRGB. If it is due to one of these things, then conversion to sRGB will do the job, but it will actually alter the colors of the image. This is the code I use to convert scanned images with ImageMagick to correct the scanner colors:\nconvert /path/to/inputfilename.tif -strip -profile /path/to/scannerprofile.icc -profile /path/to/sRGB.icc -strip /path/to/outputfilename.tif\n\nIt tells ImageMagick that the input file has the scanner profile's specifications and to convert it to sRGB. The strip command removes all metadata, so that the output file does not contain the sRGB profile (because sRGB is the usual assumption for files without a profile).\nIf the monitor is involved, then converting won't help. The image will still look somewhat different, either under- or oversaturated, depending on how much the monitor specifications are different from the file's colorspace. Not to mention a wrong monitor profile or software bugs...\n", "Q: Transfering Documents, Pictures, Music, Downloads, Videos from SSD to HDD I upgraded my laptop by changing my storage from HDD to SSD (switching from Windows 10 to Ubuntu right after) after I finished building my desktop.  With that spare 2.5\" HDD, I decided to remove the DVD player and replaced it with the HDD that was originally in my laptop (everything erased).\nNow, I want to know how to move the Documents, Downloads, Pictures, etc. from SSD to HDD. I just want to use the SSD for games & other software\nI just wish it was as easy as Windows (I just need to create folders on my HDD and have them redirect to their respective folders).\n\nA: Assuming you HDD is well formatted and mounted in Ubuntu. In other words, you can access the HDD from a file manager (e.g. Nautilus). You can just create the required folders Documents, Downloads, Pictures, etc. on you HDD. And move your files to these new locations.\nNext, there are some things you could do to make things a little more convenient.\nFor example, you could edit the ~/.config/user-dirs.dirs file. This file defines the links to the special Documents, Downloads, etc folders (these are shown in Nautilus on the left). The default content of this file looks like this:\nXDG_DESKTOP_DIR=\"$HOME/Desktop\"\nXDG_DOWNLOAD_DIR=\"$HOME/Downloads\"\nXDG_TEMPLATES_DIR=\"$HOME/Templates\"\nXDG_PUBLICSHARE_DIR=\"$HOME/Public\"\nXDG_DOCUMENTS_DIR=\"$HOME/Documents\"\nXDG_MUSIC_DIR=\"$HOME/Music\"\nXDG_PICTURES_DIR=\"$HOME/Pictures\"\nXDG_VIDEOS_DIR=\"$HOME/Videos\"\n\nYou can just edit this file to reflect the changes you made.\nTo resemble the original situation even more, you could add bind mounts to your /etc/fstab file. If you go this route, you don't need to change the ~/.config/user-dirs.dirs file. You would just bind mount for example the new location of the Documents folder (on your HDD), to the original location in your HOME folder. You could accomplish this by adding a line like this to your /etc/fstab:\n/<mount-point-hdd>/Documents /home/<user-name>/Documents none rw,bind 0 0\n\n", "Q: Develop a Snap package for project using SDL2 I am currently developing an application that uses joystick input and generates different wave sounds using SDL. While the implementation works without any issues, once I package my application using snapcraft, my application is not able to generate sounds nor getting joystick input.\nThe interfaces that my application uses are:\n\n\n*\n\n*x11\n\n*network\n\n*pulseaudio\n\n*network-bind\n\n*system-observe\n\n*network-observe\n\n\nAdditionally, when running my application from a terminal, I get the following errors/warnings:\nshm_open() failed: Permission denied\nALSA lib conf.c:3750:(snd_config_update_r) Cannot access file /usr/share/alsa/alsa.conf\nALSA lib pcm.c:2266:(snd_pcm_open_noupdate) Unknown PCM default\nXmbTextListToTextProperty result code -2\n\nThese warnings do not appear if I run my application the \"classic\" way (sudo make install). Is it possible to configure my snapcraft.yaml to let SDL2 work correctly?\n\nA: You're running into part of the security structure, which even in configure: devmode still prevents the snap from doing arbitrary operations on the system. I've been fooling around on the snappy-playpen github, (which has a gitter chatroom), but I am by no means an expert. If you are defining plugs for each of your apps/parts and are hooking them up to the ubuntu-core slots after snaping, then you've got some serious stuff to work through. If you haven't done that, keep working at it. Have you got your snapcraft.yaml up anywhere?\nThe snapd component of snappy is still under heavy development, and snapcraft itself as well. What is still manual today might be better automated soon. However, I would first suggest moving your project into the snappy-playpen repo and getting some help from the community team and snappy devs. There will be an online clinic upcoming this Tuesday, 21 June.

If you installed Ubuntu server, you would have to install various packages to get a graphical user interface. Perhaps the easiest would be to install the Ubuntu desktop meta-package:\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop\n\nIf you have a Ubuntu desktop installation, and no graphical user interface is started. You have to make sure you have X (type start x from a shell for example), a display manager (e.g. lightdm) and a window manager of some kind (e.g. compiz).\n", "Q: NetGear WNA3100M Wireless N300 not detecting any WiFi On Ubuntu Mate 16.04.

I don't even know if what I'm asking is doable, but suppose I loved one EOL version of Ubuntu and wanted not to upgrade to a supported version but rather add/replace the old repositories with the most current one. Will my EOL system break down as soon as I start updating and/or upgrading?\nTo illustrate, take ubuntu 10.04. Will adding new 16.04 repos kill it? \n\nA: If you replace the standard available repositories in /etc/apt/sources.list with the current ones then your question makes no sense because this will upgrade the system anyway since it installs the latest version of software available in the repositories. This method is officially unsupported but it does work. I always use this method. There's one catch if you do this you'll have to do it on a regular basis. Going from 10.04 to 16.04 means skipping 6 years or 12 versions and that's a very long period. You might encounter incompatibilities or even break the system.\n", "Q: How do I upgrade the default torrent client (Transmission) in 16.04? I have read the Changelog and I am very keen to upgrade Xenial's default torrent client Transmission. There have been many improvements and bug fixes since Transmission version 2.84 which comes with Xenial, a version released in 2014!\nHow can I do this?\n\nA: By default Xenial Xerus 16.04 LTS carries quite an aged version of Transmission. There is an outside chance that a newer version may come through Ubuntu Backports but for the moment there is a very solid and stable PPA that carries the most recent version.\nTo add this PPA and then install the very latest version (2.9.2) run the following commands in a Terminal window:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:transmissionbt/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install transmission\n\nAnd this is enough to get you the very latest Transmission complete with all of the recent security updates and improvements. A screenshot from my own Xenial system:\n\nThere have been several releases in 2016 (2.90 and 2.92), with the promise of more to come, so having the PPA added to your system ensures that you will stay up to date when future releases of Transmission are rolled out.\nReferences:\n\n\n*\n\n*Transmission Changelogs\n\n*PPA: “transmissionbt” team\n", "Q: Run my bash script on login and SEE terminal i need your help :)\nI have some script that start on login (I set it on Application launcher preference) but i can't see terminal.\nOne script it's easy and make light on on my CMstorm keyboard and set numlock to ON.\nAnother script (too long) check update for every row with Internet, but i can't able to see if the process are in download mode or if script end.\nI would like this script open terminal and run it into the terminal, in this case i will be able to see what script are doing.\nMy script is in $home/Desktop/Elaborati/script1.sh\nI think it's necessary to create another script that lauch script1.sh in a new gnome-terminal...but I'm not able to do it. \nCan you help me please\nThank you very much\n\nA: Try changing the startup entry to this:\nx-terminal-emulator -e \"bash -c '~/Desktop/Elaborati/script1.sh'\"\n\nHowever, if you don't want the terminal to close once the script has finished executing, use this instead:\nx-terminal-emulator -e \"bash -c '~/Desktop/Elaborati/script1.sh;echo Press any key to close this window...;read -sn1 null'\"\n\nWhy 'bash -c'?

I have tried Fn + Ctrl + Alt on all of the keys F1 - F6, and they all take me to black screens. Fn + Ctrl + Alt + F7 takes me back to LightDM.\nI have also tried pressing Esc on boot, and editing the GRUB boot option for Ubuntu. (I changed quiet splash to nomodeset). I pressed F10 to boot, but nothing changed. MATE would not start, nor would the other consoles show anything.\nIf I could just get into a command line then I could try to fix this (resetting .Xauthority, uninstalling nVidia's proprietary drivers, whatever I need to do), but I cannot even get to a command line! I really would not like to reinstall Linux right now, does anyone know how I can fix my problem and/or get to a command line?\n\nA: I have fixed my login problem. It turns out that I had done a very Stupid Thing which was messing with the PATH variable without knowing what I was doing.\nFirst, I booted the install media and chrooted to my ubuntu install (using the directions here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/LiveCdRecovery#Update_Failure). I checked that .Xauthority had the correct permissions, and it did. So I uninstalled Nvidia's driver by running sudo apt-get purge nvidia* in the chrooted environment and rebooted. This did nothing to help me log in, but (I think) it allowed me to change consoles. When I did change the console, it was showing a bunch of errors related to the PATH variable (such as \"/usr/bin is not included in the PATH variable\"). So I went into /etc/profile.d where I had created a shell script that edited the path variable. I saw the mistake I had made (literally a single space) and fixed it, and now everything is working.\n", "Q: Add a user with an already existing home directory I recently reinstalled Ubuntu. Since I had a separate partition for /home, I was able to keep my old files.\nNow I need to add another user, let's say named \"bob.\" The /home/bob directory already exists. How do I create the new user bob who has that as his home directory?\nWill I be able to simply create the new user via the settings GUI or are there any pitfalls regarding file permissions, hidden configuration files, etc?\nIf it's pertinent, I upgraded Ubuntu 14.04.3 to 16.04. Also, my own account, which I created during the new installation, worked fine with the old home directory.\n\nA: adduser bob --no-create-home --home /home/bob/ --uid [the_uid]\n--help gives you all the possible flags you can use.\n\nA: For those who use useradd as a habit, try this:\nsudo useradd -s [your_shell_of_choice] -d /home/bob -M bob\nsudo chown -R bob:bob /home/bob\n\n\n*\n\n*-d is equivalent to --home\n\n*-M is equivalent to --no-create-home\n\n*-s is usually followed by /bin/bash, but it's your choice\n\n\nSee also: useradd --help. Actually, you'll find it to be similar to adduser.\n\nA: I solved it by the following:\n# adduser --home /home/bob bob\n# chown -R bob:bob /home/bob\n\nSince the new user does not automatically own the old home directory, they are initially unable to login. So I had to use the second line.\nFinally, there are still some glitches in the new account. I assume I will have to clear all of the cache and config files from the old home directory (~/.config, ~/.cache, and ~/.local/share it seems).\n", "Q: Ubuntu 16.04 PGP Key Importing problems I just installed Ubuntu 16.04.

However after some time, the percentage was being evaluated incorrectly especially after coming back from hibernation. It may have been some issues with qdbus but the brightness level won't just change. So, I decided to hardcode the brightness level using the value from max_brightness file. Here's my /usr/local/bin/auto-backlight.sh :\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\n\nread MAX_BRIGHTNESS < /sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/max_brightness\n\ndeclare -i -r BATT_PERCENTAGE=45 \ndeclare -i -r AC_PERCENTAGE=90 \ndeclare -i -r ON_BATT=$(($MAX_BRIGHTNESS*$BATT_PERCENTAGE/100)) \ndeclare -i -r ON_AC=$(($MAX_BRIGHTNESS*$AC_PERCENTAGE/100))\n\nwait_ac_connect() {   while ! on_ac_power ; do : ; sleep 0.25 ; done   echo \"Adapter plugged in.

Also note that possibly you need to change the value of / 10 depending of the value of max_brightness, it could be 100, 50, 5, etc. as it is a division factor.\nGive execution permissions to the new created script:\nchmod 771 auto-backlight.sh\nThen create a file named 99auto-backlight.rules with your favorite editor and put it in the /etc/udev/rules.d/ folder: sudo gedit /etc/udev/rules.d/99auto-backlight.rules (or link it with using the \"ln\" command), containing the following two lines:\nSUBSYSTEM==\"power_supply\", ATTR{online}==\"0\", RUN+=\"/path/to/your/script/auto-backlight.sh true\"\nSUBSYSTEM==\"power_supply\", ATTR{online}==\"1\", RUN+=\"/path/to/your/script/auto-backlight.sh false\"\n\nReplace /path/to/your/script/ with the actual path were the auto-backlight.sh script is located.\nCredit to Alex Layton for his idea here: https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/110469 and to Pilot6 for his idea here: https://askubuntu.com/a/613816\n\nA: Cuttlefish is a tool that helps automate settings changes based on events such us as plugging and unplugging the power supply\n", "Q: How to add icons on the KDE Menu Editor icon source? I want to know the location of items of these two options:\n\n\n*\n\n*System icons\n\n*Other icons\n\n\nI do not know how to add icons to the list. How to do?\n\n\nA: This is something which has frustrated me for a long time.\nYou should be able to right click on any icon and get the path to it, but that hasn't been implemented. \nSince you haven't received a good answer, I'll give you a few clues.\nHere are some places icons live:\n/usr/share/app-install/icons\n/usr/share/icons\n/usr/local/share/icons\n/usr/share/pixmaps\n\nYou can browse through them in Dolphin with Show Previews of Files and Folders turned on. Then, you'll see how they render.\nYou could, theoretically, add your new icons in these locations, but they might get deleted when you do software updates and upgrades. They will certainly be gone sooner or later when you do a clean install.\nWhat I do instead is to save all my favorite icons (including some from the above locations) separately - especially because several that I really liked went away in newer releases. Now I put them in my own directory.\n/home/my-user/icons\n\nThat way I can keep them no matter what I or the developers decide to do.\nThen, when I want to use one from the icon dialog, I select Other Icons and Browse and go to the directory where I have them saved.\n", "Q: How do I get my USB to work in windows xp guest.

Then I shrinked the volume for Ubuntu and installed it via Live USB (\"Something else\" method). Once successfully installed, I booted into Ubuntu just fine.

Frequently, I can't read the text on the image previews I'm looking at in the upload dialogue box. \nAs I tend to pick the images I'm going to upload from the dialogue box, this is a serious hurdle for me. Obviously I'd like to change that, maybe make the thumbnail/preview area twice the size so that visibility is better. How do I do that?\n\n\nA: I have the same problem.. it's quite ridiculous, it makes finding the right image incredibly painful.\nIn the regular Nautilus window you can tweak the icon size well enough, but in the Open File dialog (File selector) you only get 'nearly invisible'.  Why can't you switch to a grid layout here with larger icons sizes?\n(And then if the drive happens to be a network drive you don't get any preview at all.)\n\n", "Q: Fn+F1 keystroke acts like Super+S I don't know why, but I know it happening.\nAfter realizing that both Fn+F1 and Super+S switches between workspaces, I used xev and found out that Ubuntu senses Fn+F1 as Super+S.\nIn other words, Fn+F1 is interpreted as the same keystroke.\nWhy is this, and how do I fix it?\nAdded Info\n\n\n*\n\n*The Leopard shortcuts menu has neither Fn+F1 nor Super+S\n\n*When I bind a shortcut to Fn+F1, the workspace selection screen appears, and when I back out, I find it to be set to Super+S.\n\n\nUpdate\nTurns out that my computer's bios reset whether I needed to use the Fn key to activate special keys, and now after fixing it I need to press Fn+F1, which is shown on my keyboard to be the Search key.\n\nA: Navigate to System Settings -> Keyboard -> Shortcuts.\nIt should look like this:\n\nThere should be options available to configure the shortcuts there.

We have to keep clicking to increase or decrease the volume on the keyboard volume button.\nCan we change the sound volume in a continuous way just by holding down the keyboard volume button and the volume increase/decrease would be proportional to the amount of time i held it down?\n(Ubuntu 16.04)\n\nA: You can set up custom keyboard shortcut to do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Settings > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Custom Short Shortcuts \n\n\nHere add new shortcut.Give a name to it and for volume up give the command as: \npactl set-sink-volume 0 +2%\nFor volume down ;\npactl set-sink-volume 0 -- -2% \nNow set  the required keyboard short cut by clicking the entry and then pressing the required shortcut. \nOnce done, close it and test. This solution should work since the we keep the n% change small and by continuous pressing for longer time the n% adds up to give bigger change. \n\nYou can also set fixed volume shortcuts like 25%, 50% , 75% and so on. Just use,\npactl set-sink-volume 0 n% \nand change n to the required number.\n", "Q: Unable to launch steam/tf2 using nouveau Trying to use nouveau driver isntead of the nvidia driver cause of poor performance, but I am unable to launch steam to use the dedicated card.\nLaunching as env DRI_PRIME=1 steam steam://rungameid/440\ngetting\nRunning Steam on ubuntu 16.04 64-bit\nSTEAM_RUNTIME is enabled automatically\ngrep: symbol lookup error: grep: undefined symbol: pcre_jit_stack_alloc\ngrep: symbol lookup error: grep: undefined symbol: pcre_jit_stack_alloc\ngrep: symbol lookup error: grep: undefined symbol: pcre_jit_stack_alloc\nInstalling breakpad exception handler for appid(steam)/version(1465948400)\nlibGL error: unable to load driver: nouveau_dri.so\nlibGL error: driver pointer missing\nlibGL error: failed to load driver: nouveau\nlibGL error: unable to load driver: swrast_dri.so\nlibGL error: failed to load driver: swrast\n\nLaunching tf2 seperately also fails,.

Make sure you copy the run file into your /home/your-username directory. Do not copy it into documents or downloads. That makes it more difficult for you.\nStop using the Nouveau driver by using the \"Configure Video Card\" to enable the VESA video driver. Do not remove Nouveau or you will upset shared libraries. After installing VESA with the low resolution.\nFrom here on I suggest you either write the following commands on a piece of paper or bookmark this page on your phone.\n\n*\n\n*Open a terminal.\n\n\n*As root, enter init 3 (init 3  =  Network is present, multitasking is present but without a GUI) Nvidia will never install in a graphical user interface. Now you panic as you only have black screen waiting for your input.\n\n\n*Enter root.\n\n\n*Enter your password.\n\n\n*Enter cd /home/yourname (This places you looking at your home directory).\n\n\n*Enter ls (This shows you what files are there in your home directory; complete with the name of the nvidia.run file that you need for the next step.)\n\n\n*Enter sh NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-xxx.xx.run (Type exactly what Nvidia name ls shows you.)\n\n\n*Answer all questions with yes by using the left or right keys and Enter key to accept.\nThe .run file is a self-extracting archive. When executed, it extracts the contents of the archive and runs the contained nvidia-installer utility, which provides an interactive interface to walk you through the installation.\n\n\n*After Nvidia installer finishes the init 3 screen returns to your root command.

I do not want to install X11 libraries on my server. \n\nA: You can see the packages here http://packages.ubuntu.com/xenial/collectd.\nKeep in mind, that --no-install-recommends applies recursively to all dependencies, so I would try something like:\nsudo apt-get install collectd-core #to make sure recommendations will be installed too and then\n\nsudo apt-get install --no-install-recommends collectd\n\nIf you follow the dependencies there is for example the chain librrd4-> libcairo2-> libx11-6 which can't be avoided when you install collectd since it's dependency and not recommendation, but it's just libraries so I don't know why you don't want them installed. In order to avoid it, install only the package collectd-core and then with the option --no-install-recommends additional packages that you might need (you need to figure them out yourself).\n", "Q: Lock screen while video keeps playing on second display it seems impossible to me, but I was just wondering if it's possible to lock the screen (i.e. no one has access to my computer) while the second screen still displays a full-screen video.\nBy default, when I click Super+L both displays show my wallpaper with the box to enter my password. I would like this to stay on my main display (the laptop's) while the second display plays the video.\nI am using Ubuntu 14.04\nThank you very much in advance.\n\nA: The solution was to create a guest account, and play the video from this account.\n", "Q: cannot connect to MYSQL server through phpmyadmin \nThis is my phpmyadmin login page.

But I'm wondering about the decision when they select an specific software over other similar ones to be installed by default on the OS, for example transmission.\n\n\n*\n\n*So is there any explanation by Canonical over these kinds of decisions and selections?\n\n*Are these decisions more about system stability and performance rather than popularity?\n\n\nA: Mark Shuttleworth had a blog post about this and the key questions are ...\n\nIn evaluating an app for the Ubuntu default install, we should ask:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*is it free software?\n  \n*is it best-in-class?\n  \n*does it integrate with the system settings and preferences?\n  \n*does it integrate with other applications?\n  \n*is it accessible to people who cannot use a mouse, or keyboard?\n  \n*does it look and feel consistent with the rest of the system?\n  \n\nThe discussion about default apps starts at the Ubuntu Developer Summit. 16.05 was the last online one (UOS). But changing an app to another will need a blueprint or something similar before it gets picked up (there has been an ongoing discussion on replacing firefox for chromium for years. That one is more likely to be based on sentiment and popularity than any of the above).\n", "Q: While trying to install git, \"errors were encountered while processing: runit, git-daemon-run\" I'm trying to install git using\nsudo apt-get install git-all\n\nbut I'm getting an error message which ends as follows:\nErrors were encountered while processing:\n runit\n git-daemon-run\nE: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (1)\n\nI've tried purging runit, git-all, and git, autoremoving, and re-installing as suggested in How to fix error processing package git-daemon-run?, but I still get the same error message.

I removed the old connection and set up a new one manually which worked for me.\nTo remove the old connection, I removed the file named \"eduroam\" in the directory \"/etc/NetworkManager/system-connections\".\nYou may set up Eduroam manually as follows: type \"sudo nm-connection-editor\" in terminal.

It appears that xmodmap is perhaps the best option, but I can't figure out how to get a third-level character.\nI have my third-level chooser mapped to Right-Win key, and this works for characters like the EuroSign.  I used that key as my pattern. xmodmap -pk shows this for EuroSign\n     26         0x0065 (e)      0x0045 (E)      0x0065 (e)      0x0045 (E)      0x20ac (EuroSign)       0x0000 (NoSymbol)       0x20ac (EuroSign)       0x20ac (EuroSign)\n\nSo I setup my comma line to try and match that\nkeycode 59 = comma less comma semicolon UFF62 UFF62 UFF62 UFF62\n\nBut this doesn't work, despite xmodmap -pk reporting a similar output as EuroSign\n59         0x002c (comma)  0x003c (less)   0x002c (comma)  0x003b (semicolon)      0x100ff62 (UFF62)       0x100ff62 (UFF62)       0x100ff62 (UFF62)       0x100ff62 (UFF62)\n\nNote that if I put UFF62 as the first entry I can successfully replace the comma itself. That confirms at least that I've modifying the right file and the character is valid.\nHow do I get my Unicode character assigned to the third level?\nUPDATE: This appears to only not work if I have the US-generic keyboard layout. When I switch to my German layout the mapped keys work. Is there something I have to do to enable the third-level ont he keyboard layout?\nNote, my use-case is to just get a key mapped to a character. I also tried xbindkeys with xvkbd, but was unable to get it to insert unicode characters correctly.  I also tried xdotool, but it also seemed to have trouble with unicode characters.\n\nA: This question is really old, and the only reason I'm here is because of an online search term query, which led me into some of my own correlation and research, so I'll be brief in my answer.\nI've read it on the Arch Wiki, and there seems to be a known issue. Apparently, there is some kind of incompatibility regarding US keyboard layouts and the 3rd Level. The only way to use the 3rd level seems to be by using the International US layout, which can by done by typing setxkbmap -layout 'us(intl)' in the Terminal, or setting it permanently through the Xorg configuration files.\nThis was written in the best interest of anyone else searching for the same answer. Hope this helps those in the future. If this does not answer your question, the answer may be within the Xorg settings.\n", "Q: When trying to import Matplotlib.pyplot, get \"UnicodeDecodeError\" When trying to run a Python script starting with\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nI'm getting the following error message:\n/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/matplotlib/font_manager.py:273: UserWarning: Matplotlib is building the font cache using fc-list.

Just see my example:\nchmod 700 /path/folder\nsudo chown -R root:root /path/folder\n\nSee here for more information on file permissions.\n\nA: Wrong command. You need to change owner and group to 'root'.\nchown root:root /path/to/directory\n\nAnd if you want to harden it even more put the 'immutable' on it with \nchattr -i /path/to/directory\n\n(only 'root' can set this back).\n\nchmod 000 /path/to/directory\n\nonly removes permissions but it is still owned by the user (and the group it belongs to). It does not make it only for 'root'. Removing permissions from a directory makes in non-executable and for someone to enter it you need that set. \n", "Q: ubuntu-touch: packages not configured in libertine containers Situation\nI have installed a number of programs in a libertine container - some via the libertine command, and some by 'apt get' after entering the container.\nIt seems that many of them are not properly conifgured - or that dependencies are not configured. \nSymptoms\nThis is what I see if I try to install something in the container with apt-get:\nAfter this operation, 0 B of additional disk space will be used.\nSetting up x11-common (1:7.7+7ubuntu4) ...\nopen: No such file or directory\ndpkg: error processing package x11-common (--configure):\n subprocess installed post-installation script returned error exit status 1\ndpkg: dependency problems prevent configuration of libice6:armhf:\n libice6:armhf depends on x11-common; however:\n  Package x11-common is not configured yet.\n\ndpkg: error processing package libice6:armhf (--configure):\n dependency problems - leaving unconfigured\ndpkg: dependency problems prevent configuration of libsm6:armhf:\n libsm6:armhf depends on libice6 (>= 1:1.0.0); however:\n  Package libice6:armhf is not configured yet.\n\ndpkg: error processing package libsm6:armhf (--configure):\n dependency problems - leaving unconfigured\ndpkg: dependency problems prevent configuration of libxt6:armhf:\n libxt6:armhf depends on libice6 (>= 1:1.0.0); however:\n  Package libice6:armhf is not configured yet.\n libxt6:armhf depends on libsm6; however:\n  Package libsm6:armhf is not configured yet.\n\ndpkg: error processing package libxt6:armhf (--configure):\n dependency problems - leaving unconfigured\nSetting up isc-dhcp-client (4.3.1-5ubuntu2.3) ...\nmktemp: failed to create file via template ‘/run/user/32011/confined/com.ubuntu.terminal/tmp.XXXXXXXXXX’: No such file or directory\ndpkg: error processing package isc-dhcp-client (--configure):\n subprocess installed post-installation script returned error exit status 1\nSetting up ca-certificates (20141019ubuntu0.15.04.1) ...\nSetting up dictionaries-common (1.23.17) ...\ndpkg: dependency problems prevent configuration of ghostscript-x:\n ghostscript-x depends on libxt6; however:\n  Package libxt6:armhf is not configured yet.\n\ndpkg: error processing package ghostscript-x (--configure):\n dependency problems - leaving unconfigured\ndpkg: dependency problems prevent configuration of transfig:\n transfig depends on x11-common; however:\n  Package x11-common is not configured yet.\n\ndpkg: error processing package transfig (--configure):\n dependency problems - leaving unconfigured\ndpkg: dependency problems prevent configuration of xournal:\n xournal depends on ghostscript-x; however:\n  Package ghostscript-x is not configured yet.\n\ndpkg: error processing package xournal (--configure):\n dependency problems - leaving unconfigured\nProcessing triggers for ca-certificates (20141019ubuntu0.15.04.1) ...\nmktemp: failed to create file via template ‘/run/user/32011/confined/com.ubuntu.terminal/ca-certificates.crt.tmp.XXXXXX’: No such file or directory\ndpkg: error processing package ca-certificates (--configure):\n subprocess installed post-installation script returned error exit status 1\nProcessing triggers for dictionaries-common (1.23.17) ...\nmktemp: failed to create directory via template ‘/run/user/32011/confined/com.ubuntu.terminal/ispell-auto.XXXXXXXXXX’: No such file or directory\nispell-autobuildhash: Cannot make temporary directory under \"/run/user/32011/confined/com.ubuntu.terminal\".

So for people stumbling on this problem from Google, here it is.  From the bash manual, under PROMPTING:\n\\[     begin a sequence of non-printing characters,\n       which could be used to embed a terminal control\n       sequence into the prompt\n\\]     end a sequence of non-printing characters\n\nThese characters should surround your colour control sequences.  So instead of:\n\\e[94mBluest blue\\e[0m\n\nYou should use\n\\[\\e[94m\\]Bluest blue\\[\\e[0m\\]\n\nWhich allows bash to calculate the correct location for the prompt.\n\nA: Use this instead:\nPS1=\"\\[\\033[01;32m\\]\\u\\[\\033[0;37m\\]@\\[\\033[01;37m\\]\\h:\\[\\033[01;34m\\]\\w \\[\\033[01;35m\\]$ \\[\\033[0;37m\\]\"\n\nI'm afraid I don't really understand the details so I can't give you a complete answer as to why this is happening. I think this comes down to different terminal emulators having different formats for the ANSI escape sequences, but I'm not sure. \nWhat I have done in the line above is to translate your use of \\e to the equivalent \\[\\033[. That one seems to work, at least on my terminal. \n", "Q: Kubuntu 16.04 + Bumblebee Failed to load module \"mouse\" (module does not exist, 0) I upgraded Kubuntu from 15.10, installed bumblebee-nvidia nvidia-364\noptirun glxgears is working, but i can't run any game with steam\njuin 18 15:15:10 kwaadpepper-pc bumblebeed[31999]: [ 1258.527072] [ERROR][XORG] (EE) Failed to load module \"mouse\" (module does not exist, 0)\n\njuin 18 15:15:10 kwaadpepper-pc bumblebeed[31999]: [ 1258.527077] [WARN][XORG] (WW) NVIDIA(0): Unable to get display device for DPI computation.\n\njuin 18 15:15:10 kwaadpepper-pc bumblebeed[31999]: [ 1258.527080] [WARN][XORG] (WW) Warning, couldn't open module mouse\n\njuin 18 15:15:10 kwaadpepper-pc bumblebeed[31999]: [ 1258.527082] [ERROR][XORG] (EE) Failed to load module \"mouse\" (module does not exist, 0)\n\njuin 18 15:15:46 kwaadpepper-pc bumblebeed[31999]: [ 1294.315083] [WARN][XORG] (WW) \"glamoregl\" will not be loaded unless you've specified it to be loaded elsewhere.\n\njuin 18 15:15:46 kwaadpepper-pc bumblebeed[31999]: [ 1294.315095] [WARN][XORG] (WW) Warning, couldn't open module mouse\n\njuin 18 15:15:46 kwaadpepper-pc bumblebeed[31999]: [ 1294.315100] [ERROR][XORG] (EE) Failed to load module \"mouse\" (module does not exist, 0)\n\njuin 18 15:15:46 kwaadpepper-pc bumblebeed[31999]: [ 1294.315106] [WARN][XORG] (WW) NVIDIA(0): Unable to get display device for DPI computation.\n\njuin 18 15:15:46 kwaadpepper-pc bumblebeed[31999]: [ 1294.315109] [WARN][XORG] (WW) Warning, couldn't open module mouse\n\njuin 18 15:15:46 kwaadpepper-pc bumblebeed[31999]: [ 1294.315111] [ERROR][XORG] (EE) Failed to load module \"mouse\" (module does not exist, 0)\n\nI compiled xserver-xorg-input-mouse but i depended on ABI 21 something so, bumblebee could not work, using ABI 22 on 16.04.\nIs anyone having this, or any clue here ?\nHere is the package installed https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xserver-xorg-input-mouse/1:1.9.1-1/+build/6508811\nthere is no xenial amd64 package so i took the willy one that depends on xorg-input-abi-21 .\n\nA: Please don't install any packages.\nJust edit the file /etc/bumblebee/xorg.conf.nvidia to include the following screen-section to make bumblebee work:\nSection \"Screen\"\n  Identifier \"Default Screen\"\n  Device \"DiscreteNvidia\"\nEndSection\n\n(To open the file for editing, run sudo kate /etc/bumblebee/xorg.conf.nvidia )\nAfter a restart of bumblebee, it works properly.\n", "Q: Accidentally erased 14.04-4 ubuntu and installed 14.04-1 I accidentally erased my Ubuntu 14.04-4 version and installed old one.

I already tried changing to my own shell and surprisingly it worked without an error msg. Now does that mean that the login shell decides itself which scripts to run and there is no script that the login shell must run?\nI thought that .login or .aliases or similar were always run. \n\nA: The profile file is always run by login shell, and if you want other scripts to be sourced by the login shell, you mention them in profile\n\nA: Depends on the design of your shell.\n\nDoes it follow the POSIX standard?\n\nIf Yes, then your shell needs to read the ENV environment variable at start of any interactive session and read/execute the content of the file(s) the ENV variable refers. No other file needs to be read as per the standard. This is a bare minimum for POSIX conformation as far as reading files while starting is concerned.\n\nWhat about customization?\n\nThe thing is, most of the shells nowadays use specific files to read/source/execute while starting a session. Files differ for various session types. For example, bash sources the files /etc/profile and one of ~/.bash_profile, ~/.bash_login, ~/.profile (first one available following the order) while starting a login interactive session. Most popular shells do that too, but again this is a design decision, not a standard.\n", "Q: Installing virtual machine with KVM failed on \"Load installer components from CD\" I am using KVM to install a virtual machine, and after that the image will be uploaded to create an OpenStack virtual machine instance.

Another issue is that you selected the format qcow2 and created an .img file. You have to execute this command : qemu-img create -f qcow2 ubuntu.qcow2 20G.  \nDownload the latest stable version of GParted Live | Direct download link -> GParted 0.26.1-1 \nInsert the ISO file and the virtual disk, boot from the GParted ISO file, create a new partition table, new partitions and and format them. Here is a presentation on how to prepare a disk.\nThis is an advanced advice, creating the partition table and format it with ext4 is sufficient.\nkvm -hda ubuntu.qcow2 -cdrom gparted-live-0.26.1-1-amd64.iso -boot d -enable-kvm  \n\nAfter the operation is finished close (poweroff) GParted Live to shutdown the virtual machine.

Lubuntu (a very lightweight version of Ubuntu) still offers PowerPC downloads, but requires a minimum of 640MB of RAM for the PowerPC versions. You can try the \"alternate\" installer, but with such little RAM, it might not be usable if it even runs.\nYou can download lubuntu-16.04-alternate-powerpc.iso from the following site:\nhttp://cdimage.ubuntu.com/lubuntu/releases/xenial/release/\n\nA: For an old G4 you're only hope could be Lubuntu (any version). It's not about the version number (14, 15, 16, etc), it's more about the flavor. And the lightest flavor of Ubuntu is Lubuntu. And that still might be too much for the G4.

So, you have to re-enable those repos (or PPAs) and edit the sources with the right information (distro name). You will also have to check if the developers are distributing their packages for Xenial (Launchpad for PPAs)\nSee snaps here:\nHow to activate deactivated repository after upgrade?\n\nA: *\n\n*Upgrading will replace your current software with newer versions of that software.\n\n*An upgrade can go wrong and if the end result is a reinstall your installed software will get removed. \n\n*In theory software could be removed if it is deemed obsolete. Or replaced by something new (open office got replaced by libre office at some point; though the impact of that was minor or close to nothing).\n\n*ALWAYS make a backup of your personal files.

Here's the new code:\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\n\"\"\"Creates a Notification pop-up bubble\"\"\"\nimport dbus\nitem              = \"org.freedesktop.Notifications\"\npath              = \"/org/freedesktop/Notifications\"\ninterface         = \"org.freedesktop.Notifications\"\napp_name          = \"brightness\"\nid_num_to_replace = 0\nicon              = \"weather-clear\"\ntitle             = \"Message\"\ntext              = \"Body\"\nactions_list      = ''\nhint              = '\"{'type':i, 'name':'value', 'value':'$(xbacklight -get)'}\" \"{'type':'string', 'name':'synchronous', 'value':'volume'}\"'\ntime              = 5000   # Use seconds x 1000\n\nbus = dbus.SessionBus()\nnotif = bus.get_object(item, path)\nnotify = dbus.Interface(notif, interface)\nnotify.Notify(app_name, id_num_to_replace, icon, title, text, actions_list, hint, time)\n\nAnd the error:\nFile \"/home/pygeek03/bin/brightness.py\", line 13\n hint              = '\"{'type':i, 'name':'value', 'value':'$(xbacklight -get)'}\" \"{'type':'string', 'name':'synchronous', 'value':'volume'}\"'\n                           ^\nSyntaxError: invalid syntax\n\n\nA: It's just invalid python syntax. What you do with the strings for hint does not make any sense. Try seeing matching quotes for example.\nhint should be:\n\nhint = {'type':'i', 'name':'value', 'value':int(os.system('xbacklight -get'))}\n\n", "Q: How do I update CTags in Kate? I am new to CTags, and I tried it out for the first time a while back.

I've opened up a new project, I've run ctags and it's created the tags file in the project root directory. I've confirmed it works in vim and I can jump between definitions as expected.\nWhen I open Kate, I add the tags file (/home/jeff/project/tags) to the index targets, and click Update Index but now when I try to goto definition, it's always:\n\nNo hits found\n\nI've also tried updating the database, and it's created a session_db_ with today's date.\nI also tried creating the .kateproject file as proposed by an answer to this question, which is something I didn't have to do last time it worked anyway.\n\nA: Figured it out, instead of adding the tags file (/home/jeff/project/tags) to the target index, I was supposed to just add the directory that the tags file is in (/home/jeff/project/) - not the tags file itself.\nAfter changing the target index to /home/jeff/project/ and updating the index, then I am easily able to hop to definitions like I expect.\n", "Q: How can I uninstall amazon app on ubuntu?

I'm doing something wrong?\n\nA: The packages and dependencies needed for OpenStack are in the Canonical Cloud Archive, which is not the archie you have installed. See https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ServerTeam/CloudArchive for details. You can use those packages together with puppet or chef or your preferred configuraiton management system to build whatever kind of openstack you like.\nHowever, the recommended approach is to use Juju and MAAS. The juju charms model the various applications in openstack much more naturally and you will find it infinitely easier for build small, medium or large openstack clouds if you master juju. I have seen many substantial teams, who initially rejected Juju because it was different to their existing tools, who came back to it with relief after suffering through a large deployment without it. The reason is that Juju models applications at scale, it doesn't worry so much about machines. That means you focus on the components you want.\nI would suggest you start with the conjure-up tool, as a way to start to understand Juju and OpenStack better. Use 16.04 and try apt install openstack, sudo conjure-up openstack. \n", "Q: Path of the flags XFCE (layout keyboard) Under XFCE.

I'd like to associate a flag to the Latin American Spanish layout --- xfce loads a plain text icon containing lat instead of a flag.\nThe solution that didn't work was to replace the es.svg by wished-flag.svg. I load then Spanish as layout but the keyboard is quite different. So I really would like to modify the file.\n\nA: The .svg files for the country flags in xfce4 are located in the /usr/share/xfce4/xkb/flags/ directory.\n\nA: Choose a flag in .svg format.

This is good.\nYou have Windows installed in Legacy mode. This is bad.\nYou can only boot one or the other, and it appears GRUB is installed to be used in UEFI mode. So you cannot boot a Legacy mode operating system from UEFI-mode GRUB IIRC.\nto get truly seamless dual-boot you'll need to either:\nReinstall Windows in UEFI mode (or convert it to UEFI mode, but that's a bit more involved).\nOr reinstall Ubuntu in legacy mode.\nI recommend having everything running in UEFI mode and disabled the \"Legacy Boot Option ROM\" setting in the UEFI setup. This will make your computer boot much much faster, and initializes your graphics card and sometimes even networking much sooner (and faster). (ASUS motherboards are my only experience in this regard, non-asus YMMV)\nIn the mean time, to boot Windows, reboot into your UEFI firmware setup, and boot manually by selecting the WD5000AAKX disk on your system.\nPS your encypted LUKS partition is not strong enough.

They are all identical 4TB Seagate HDD drives. I booted from the flash USB and come into Ubuntu. I chose to try, without installing. If I plug external drives into the USB slots, Ubuntu sees them, and it sees also the ocz drive, which it lists as 120GB volume on the left row of icons. Although the three internals are visible in Windows 7, and show up in BIOS, they do not appear when booting from the Ubuntu flash drive. I know there is nothing wrong with those three drives. I'm considering installing Ubuntu, but first I want to make sure that everything will work without problems. Please advise what I can do to make the other three internals visible. I'm running an Asus Sabertooth z77 motherboard with Intel Core i7 3770k 3.5Ghz processor, 32GB RAM, Asus Radeon GPU, and Asus Xonar DS audio card (none of which probably matters, but just to give full info in case it might matter).

inspect if the disks exist.\nThis command should list all disk in the system, and display information about the partitions.\nsudo fdisk -l\nThis command should show you each partition's GUID/ID and also the filesystem each one contains.\nsudo blkid\nFinally, this command will list all disk drives found in the Ubuntu's device directory.\nls -l /dev/sd*\nThey will be in this format:\n/dev/sda where the \"a\" is the disk. They will be lettered alphabetically but not in any actual order. (this means /dev/sda might be /dev/sdc the next time you boot the flash drive, but /dev/sdb will always exist before /dev/sdc unless you disconnect the storage device) \n/dev/sda1 and /dev/sda2 where the numbers are the partitions (if any) of the \"a\" storage device.\nIf they still do not show up, check if they are in a RAID configuration, which for motherboards built-in raid functionality is always implemented in a fakeRAID (software RAID) in which case you may need to enter the command:\nsudo dmraid -ay\nIf the drives still are not listed, make sure your Ubuntu image you're booting is up to date and that the modules (drivers) for your system have loaded correctly.\nTo view loaded modules, use this command:\nlsmod\n[Edit] To answer your newly edited question:\nFrom what I can see, Ubuntu can very much see the drives.\nFrom the command output you posted, you can ignore each entry for /dev/ram* and /dev/loop*. Those are just special devices created because you're using Ubuntu in \"live\" mode. (runs from ram only)\nThe problem with Ubuntu seeing your drives is that you're using Microsoft Logical Disk manager with the disks aka \"Dynamic Disks\". So either you're using them in RAID or some other configuration. From windows you can view/edit the configuration using the \"Disk Management\" utility located at:\nControl Panel > Administrator Tools > Disk Management\n\nLinux does not support disks configured for Microsoft LDM natively (ie. a kernel config option).

(xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx}\nCopy that guid to the clipboard and then use this command (replace  with the guid you copied):\nsudo ldmtool create volume <guid> volume1\nYou can increment the number in \"volume1\" for more disks.

I know that many people will say \"it automatically kicks in regardless of software your settings\" but that's not true. I'm not a noob.\nI'm on an AMD A6-4400m with regular frequency of 2.7 GHz, up to 3.2Ghz with TurboCore. But it seems that turbocore only works when propietary drivers are installed (am I wrong?). As of Ubuntu 16.04, fglrx support has been dropped so I don't find a way to install them or enable TurboCore.\nThis is the output of sudo cpupower frequency-info:\nboost state support:\nSupported: yes\nActive: no\nBoost States: 2\nTotal States: 8\nPstate-Pb0: 3200MHz (boost state)\nPstate-Pb1: 2900MHz (boost state)\nPstate-P0:  2700MHz\n\nOutput of cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpufreq/boost:\n1\n\nYes, I ran \"sudo modprobe msr\" before running that command. Whether on battery or plugged in TurboCore won't kick in, but with Ubuntu 14.04+fglrx it kicks in fine and in the boost state it will say that it's active. I can even notice that TurboCore is working because cpufreq-aperf will show the turbocore frequencies. Is there any solution for this with the open source amd drivers? Or tell me, there won't be a solution and I should downgrade to Ubuntu 14.04?\nEDIT: What's even worse is that a clean Windows 8.1 installation is able to reach TurboCore frequencie, without amd's drivers. The radeon driver seems to be buggy.\n\nA: Just found a way to make TurboCore working. Edited /etc/default/grub with nano and modified the line with GRUB_CMD_LINUX_[...], ending up with something like this:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash **radeon.bapm=1**\"\n\nThen\nsudo update grub; sudo modprobe msr\n\nand\nsudo cpufreq-aperf\n\nAnd see if your processor is indeed using TurboCore speeds. Plus you can see if your processor is using its UV frequencies with powersave as governor (for instance, my proc's lowest frequency is 1.4GHz, but it sometimes goes 1.2-1.0 GHz).\nIt's worth to mention too that to get the most out of your proc you'll need to set the default governor to Perfomance. Oh, and I forgot, once the processor heats up (>70°C), even if you force your processor to its max frequency (let's say, mine is 2.7GHz) it will start throttling down and it won't use TurboCore until the processor gets cooled down. This doesn't happen in windows, so the radeon driver is still buggy.\n\nA: This method works in 18.10 Cosmic Cuttlefish.\n# apt install linux-tools-generic\n\n# nano /etc/default/grub\n\nChange GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash\" to GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT= \"quiet splash radeon.bapm=1\".

There was a prompt to update some stuff, and I accepted it, and it went running while I was browsing some stuff in firefox. I was running a sudo command that I found when I was searching for something that will get rid of the Intel Haswell Mobile drivers and get the Intel HD Graphics 4000 drivers that my Windows 10 system had. (Windows has nothing to do with the situation, I just wanted the correct drivers and not one that would limit my fps to 60 and have glitches.) But while I was attempting that, the Software Update dialogue turned to the black dim that represents not responding, and I clicked on the X. It asked if I wanted to wait for it to respond or force quit, and I force quitted after a few minutes. Then, like it actually updated, I went to the Software Center to get some apps that I needed. I started to install the Synaptic Package Manager to get some updates for the updates that didn't get installed and possibly my drivers, but then it showed a dialogue that was titled, Package operation failed and said The installation or removal of a software package failed. Then I tried installing GIMP, and it said the same thing.

I postponed rebooting after a few updates recently (probably about 2-3 weeks) and when I finally had the time to reboot, I was greeted by a busybox ash prompt with messages indicating it had tried to mount my RAID partitions on /root which it could not (/dev/md127 is my root partition managed via mdadm). The message said something like Could not find init at /sbin/init. This was when trying to boot into kernel 3.13.0-88\nLuckily I had a working RAID config saved as a \"custom\" GRUB entry (with a kernel version of 3.13.0-57) and I could boot into this, and managed to change the grub.cfg definition for that entry to get me to kernel 3.13.0-88. At least that got me back into my system, but as soon as an update-grub command gets run the config gets overwritten.\nHow can I fix my Grub2 setup in such a way that it does recognize my RAID array(s), and so that the setup becomes permanent even when update-grub gets run?

Originally, the broken grub.cfg entry showed root=/dev/md127 instead of the root=UUID=... line. The above grub.cfg boots properly.

If you only have Ubuntu installed:\nInstall Virtualbox, either from the official repository or from Virtualbox's website. Then shut down your Ubuntu and use a live CD or live USB to perform the next step, as it's better to unmount the partition you are about to convert.\nAfter your live system is booted, you should resize your installed Ubuntu partition if it's too big for your virtual machine, using GParted.\nOpen a terminal, and use this command to determine the partition of your installed Ubuntu system:\nsudo blkid\n\nYour Ubuntu partition would be in the form of /dev/sdXx (e.g. /dev/sdb1).\nThen use this command in a terminal to create a raw image of sdXx:\nsudo dd if=/dev/sdXx of={PATH_TO_FILE}/ubuntu.bin\n\n{PATH_TO_FILE} should be somewhere with sufficient space to store your raw image.\nShut down live system and boot back into your installed Ubuntu system.\nOpen a terminal, and use this command to finally convert the ubuntu.bin file to virtual hard disk. As you need to use it with VMware, you should convert it to VMDK:\nvboxmanage convertfromraw {PATH_TO_FILE}/ubuntu.bin ubuntu.vmdk --format VMDK\n\nAs a note, as far as I know, VMware cannot use .vdi file, .vdi is for Virtualbox.\n", "Q: Running OS X Apps On Ubuntu 14.04 Is there any way that still works to run OS X apps on Ubuntu 14.04?

The OpenVPN manual states:\n\n--route-metric m\n  Specify a default metric m for use with --route.\n\nI'd hoped that adding route-metric 1000 to my config file would affect the default route that OpenVPN creates automatically, however I have to assume that it's only used with the --route option, and the route in question still has a metric of 0:\nDestination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags Metric Ref    Use Iface\n0.0.0.0         x.x.x.x         128.0.0.0       UG    0      0        0 tun0\n\nI can see three ways round this problem. How can I go about achieving one of them?\nOption 1: Tell OpenVPN to use a different metric when creating the default route\nOption 2: Prevent the route from being created in the first place, and use the  --route option to create my own using the vpn_gateway variable provided by this option (I think)\nOption 3: Modify the default route using the --route option. This will require knowing all the parameters of the route, so some scripting may be required.\n\nA: It looks like Option 2; preventing the default route from being created, can be achieved using the route-nopull option.\n\n--route-nopull\n\n*\n\n*When used with --client or --pull, accept options pushed by server EXCEPT for routes, block-outside-dns and dhcp options like DNS servers.\n\n\n*When used on the client, this option effectively bars the server from adding routes to the client's routing table, however note that this option still allows the server to set the TCP/IP properties of the client's TUN/TAP interface.\n\n", "Q: GParted allocation trouble on Win8.1/Ubuntu dual boot After my old hard drive crashed, I decided to install Ubuntu alongside Windows 8.1 on my new drive (Windows was installed first, both with USB). Upon configuring Ubuntu, I partitioned about 698-ish Gb to Ubuntu and 232-ishGb to Windows.\nAs of then, partitions looked like this:\n/dev/sda1 | ntfs | System Reserved | 350Mb\n/dev/sda2 | ntfs | n/a | 232.54Gb\nwhich are for Windows, and\n/dev/sda3 | extended | 698.63Gb\nwhich is for Ubuntu.\nNow sda3 has subcategories, sda5 through sda6. sda5 held 690.76Gb, and sda6, the linux-swap, held 7.87Gb. These are all formatted as ext4.\nAs of late I've wanted to repartition my drives to store 750Gb on Windows and 250Gb (or however much will actually fit after what the system needs is taken; it's a 1Tb drive) on Ubuntu. So, I booted up my laptop with the USB I installed Ubuntu on, selected \"Try Ubuntu without installing\" and opened up GParted to resize things.\nI started by shrinking sda5 to 250.00Gb, which worked perfectly. Then I had 440.76Gb of unallocated space, which I shifted to the left to it'd be next to sda2 enabling to me to expand it, thus expand Windows. But since it was unallocated, I couldn't expand sda2 into it in GParted or Windows Disk Management; I assigned a spot as sda7, but it required to have 1Mb of unallocated free space before it, which I couldn't remove...Analyzing that Mb of free space tells me its minimum size is 1Mb, but its maximum is 0Mb, and I can't change any values.\nAnd I still can't expand sda2. Now, things look like this:\n/dev/sda1 | ntfs | 350Mb\n/dev/sda2 | 232.54Gb\n/dev/sda3 | extended | 698.63Gb\n>unallocated | unallocated | 1Mb\n>/dev/sda7 | ext4 | 440.76Gb\n>/dev/sda5 | ext4 | 250Gb\n>/dev/sda6 | linux-swap | 7.87Gb\n...Can anyone tell me what's going on? And if/how I can enlarge sda2?\nThanks so much!\n\nA: As far as I'm concern, you have shrunk sda5, not sda3, so the allocated space (before creating sda7) is still inside sda3, and after being created, sda7 is inside sda3.\nI suggest you delete sda7, shrink sda3 from the left, then you can enlarge sda2.\n\nA: In gparted first reduce your sda 7 and then select the whole sda3 and reduce it. \nThen go to Windows and expand sda2 to the newly created unallocated disk space\nGOLDEN RULE: Never ever touch your windows partition with gparted. Always use disk management of windows.\n", "Q: How to open mp4 with Chrome?

Both the entry for the HDD with Vista on it, as well as the entry for your DVD drive should have the name of their respective operating system next to it.\nIf Vista is recognised, but Ubuntu is not, you should try a different program to crate the DVD (my favourite is UUI for Windows: http://www.pendrivelinux.com/universal-usb-installer-easy-as-1-2-3/).\nIf Ubuntu on the DVD is recognised, it is a bit tricky to find the exact problem.

From the GRUB documentation:\n\n(hd0,msdos1)\n\nHere, ‘hd’ means it is a hard disk drive. The first integer ‘0’ indicates the drive number, that is, the first hard disk, the string ‘msdos’ indicates the partition scheme, while the second integer, ‘1’, indicates the partition number (or the PC slice number in the BSD terminology). The partition numbers are counted from one, not from zero (as was the case in previous versions of GRUB). This expression means the second partition of the first hard disk drive.

Plane mode:\nAdd a shortcut for this command:\nnmcli radio all off\n\nHowever, this shortcut can only enable an \"Airplane Mode\" of some sort, not disabling it. To do that, add yet another shortcut for this command:\nnmcli radio all on\n\nUbuntu Gnome also has an 'Airplane Mode' integrated into its Network Settings. However Network Settings does not offer binding a shortcut to its Airplane Mode.\n2. Decrease / Increase brightness:\nIf you are using Ubuntu with Unity, the shortcut should have been enabled. If you use another desktop environment, install the power manager for that desktop. This will also pop up a notification which shows changes in the brightness in the form of a progress bar.\nIf you still cannot use the shortcut, then you can try using xbacklight. However, althought xbacklight works like a charm for my laptop, I've read that many people cannot use it. So try it out first in the terminal after installing to see if it works. If not, search for a command line tool that can change the brightness and proceed with the steps below. I will use xbacklight as example.\nAdd a shortcut for this command:\nxbacklight -inc 10 -time 0\n\nThis command will increase brightness by 10% ( -inc 10) after 0 millisecond ( -time 0)\nTo decrease brightness by 10% after 0 millisecond:\nxbacklight -dec 10 -time 0\n\nSadly, I still cannot get the notification of brightness right myself...\n3. Turn off the screen:\nIf you want to turn on the screen simply by pressing a key or moving the mouse after turning off the screen, add a shortcut to this command:\nxset dpms force off\n\nIf you want to turn off the screen completely (so that you can only turn it on by pressing another shortcut), add a shortcut for this command:\nxrandr --output LVDS1 --off\n\nTo turn on the screen after using the previous command:\nxrandr --output LVDS1 --on\n\nIf you have any problem, just sound off in the comment :)\n", "Q: Kvm Switch not signal monitor I've got this KVM switch, to connect two computers with one mouse, keyboard and monitor.

The server version does not contain any GUI but only a terminal interface, this is probably not what you want.\n\nHowever, 12.04 is already pretty old and its support will end in April 2017.

I suspect the best way to do that will be to point to the download location of the maven you want to use (PPA etc).\n", "Q: How to paste commands into a TTY? I have some rather long commands and file paths which I have copied to clipboard and need to execute in a TTY, however the file paths are too long to retype and I would like to just paste them in after the $ (I can retype the commands before them then), is there a way to do this?\nSo I would like to execute a command and have it on the next line starting with $ put the text copied to the clipboard like so:\n$ specialCommandToPasteText\n$ pastedText\n\nI am running Ubuntu GNOME 16.04 with GNOME 3.20.\n\nA: Another possible workaround not listed above involve the use of vim, pasting and running :!unix_command in command mode:\n\n\n*\n\n*copy the commands and the path to the clipboard\n\n*open vim, go to command mode Esc, enter the prompt :\n\n*type a bang !  and then paste Ctrl + Shift + V the command you previously copied in the prompt and execute\n\n\nA: It's simple, but you need an additional tool.\n\n\n*\n\n*Install the package xsel which provides an easy command to access the clipboard:\nsudo apt-get install xsel\n\n\n*Find out which $DISPLAY your desktop is using. Usually it should be :0, but you can check it by running this command in a terminal emulator on your GUI desktop:\necho $DISPLAY\n\nI will assume the output is :0, replace that with your actual output in the following commands if it's different.\n\n*Copy the command you would like to execute in the TTY, e.g. using Ctrl+C.\n\n*Switch to the TTY you want to use, e.g. to TTY1 using Ctrl+Alt+F1.\nLog in by typing your username and password.\n\n*Enter the full command you wish to run, but replace the part you want to insert from the clipboard with $(DISPLAY=:0 xsel -ob).  \nFor example if you copied a large list of packages to install, you could type this into the TTY:\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install $(DISPLAY=:0 xsel -ob)\n\nThe clipboard snippet does not necessarily have to be at the end of your command though, it may appear anywhere.\n\nTo simplify things further, let's move this still a bit complicated DISPLAY=:0 xsel -ob to a script. I'll name it PASTE (because paste is already taken), but you can also call it differently.\nTo create the script file in a location where every user can run it without having to specify the full path (I recommend /usr/local/bin for this) and to make it executable, simply run those two commands:\n( echo '#!/bin/bash' && echo 'DISPLAY=:0 xsel -ob' ) | sudo tee /usr/local/bin/PASTE\nsudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/PASTE\n\nNow you can simply embed $(PASTE) into your commands on a TTY to insert the clipboard content from your desktop there.\n\nA: Personally, I just use text files:\n\n\n*\n\n*In your desktop environment, open a terminal and\necho \"whatever long text you have copied\" > file\n\n\n*Drop to the tty and \n$(cat file)\n\n\nA: Another workaround with tmux that needs no configuration:\nLaunch tmux (Open terminal and type tmux) in the virtual \"TTY\" (Ctrl+Alt+F2 for Ubuntu) window and do your general work.\nWhenever you need to paste something into that terminal session just open a regular desktop terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T) and enter tmux, then use keystrokes Ctrl+b , then w to list active sessions and find the one you wish to paste the content into. Once done, just close the terminal on your desktop and you may continue using \"TTY\" terminal as if you hadn't ever left it!\n", "Q: UFW on Ubuntu 16, strange behaviour I am moving from ubuntu 14 to 16 and have been getting some odd behaviour with ufw.\nufw status\nufw allow 22\nufw enable\n\nMy connection gets lost.

Thank you.\n\nA: Try this. I have used the \"next\" PPA of conjure-up because it has a lot of fixes, but it also uses Juju 2.0 beta which is a beta :) Your call on whether you do that or use stock conjure-up from the stable archives. Note that the main archive will be updated to get the new conjure-up anyway, once Juju 2.0 is released.\nIf you are going to build your cloud on a single host with LXD containers, then you probably want to setup LXD to use ZFS:\nsudo apt install zfs\nsudo lxd init\n\nChoose 'zfs' and either feed it a dedicated fast disk (like a spare SSD on /dev/sdc) or ask it to create a local loopback mount. I would give it at least 60G or 120G disk for a local container filesystem in ZFS.\nYou can test your LXD with:\nlxc launch ubuntu:\nlxc list\n\nIf that all works you will see an Ubuntu container firing up. The first one has to download an Ubuntu container image, after that it is very fast. \nTo get the conjure-up tool and juju 2.0:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:conjure/next\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:juju/devel\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt install juju-2.0 conjure-up\n\nNow you can just go ahead:\nconjure-up openstack\n\nOnce Juju 2.0 is released in Xenial you could drop the add-apt-repository lines.\n", "Q: how to remove unity 8 system settings?

However, when I am away from my local network and try and access SSH, it fails with \"ECONNREFUSED\" (Connection Refused).\nWhat is the problem with this, and how do I get access to my server from outside my network?\n\nA: Since your local network works, but remote doesn't, you need to check your router settings.\nSpecifically, you need to enable port forwarding for port 22 (or another higher port and then configure the SSH server to listen on that port) from the outside to the server IP on the inside of the network.  This process varies from router to router, so you may have to look for a guide to set up port forwarding on your router.\nAs well, consider that a good portion of ISPs block port 22 inbound to residential IPs - not every ISP is okay with you running a server internally on a residential-class connection.\n", "Q: How do I modify the reboot command? I am trying to edit the reboot command to echo a message to the user, but the command itself located in /sbin is compiled. Is it possible to edit the command and have it print something out when the user types reboot?\n\nA: One way to do it as terdon shows - with a wrapper script. \nThe other approach is via function. Function names have priority over system commands and aliases, which means that if we create function reboot, it will be executed. What's convenient is that you don't have to create separate file, you can place it into /etc/bash.bashrc for all users or ~/.bashrc only for yourself.  \nAs for the function itself, we could do something like this\nreboot()\n{\n   printf \"Reboot is about to happen , press enter \"\n   read\n   /sbin/reboot\n   # or for those who like to use systemd way, you can do systemctl reboot\n}\n\nWhat's also cool is that you can press Ctrl+C to cancel out of this function\n\nA: Yes, but you would have to edit its source code, add your warning, recompile and replace the executable with the modified one. \nA much simpler approach would be to create a script that prints your warning and then calls reboot and save that script as reboot:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a file with this content and save it as /usr/bin/reboot:\n#!/bin/sh\necho \"Eeeek! You are rebooting!\"\n/sbin/reboot\n\n\n*Make it executable:\nsudo chmod a+x /usr/bin/reboot\n\nNow, when you run reboot, because /usr/bin is before /sbin in your $PATH, you will run the script which will print the warning and then run reboot. \n\nA: The easiest way to modify a command is to make an alias that shadows it and calls it either with different arguments or before/after doing something else.\nYou create an alias like this:\nalias ALIASNAME='COMMAND'\n\nDon't worry about giving the alias the same name as a command it consists of, you can not generate recursion here.\nSo to first print a message, wait a few seconds and finally reboot, this command is suitable:\necho \"Rebooting in 10 seconds - abort with CTRL+C\" && sleep 10 && reboot\n\nNow we need to alias this long command to reboot, so that it will be run instead of the original /sbin/reboot one:\nalias reboot='echo \"Rebooting in 10 seconds - abort with CTRL+C\" && sleep 10 && reboot'\n\nThis alias is now valid for your current user only, and only for this Bash session. Closing the terminal window will make it vanish again. \nTo make it persistent for your user account, we must ensure that Bash runs it every time it starts a new session. This is most easily done by appending it to your ~/.bash_aliases file. Open it with your favourite text editor. If it does not exist yet, simply create it. \nAppend the alias reboot='...' command from above to the end of the file. If you want, you can also add a comment describing what this is about. Comment lines must start with a # character. Save the file after you finished the edit.\nWhen you now open a new terminal window, the alias will work.\n\nPlease note that this approach is for 16.04, where (for whatever reason) /sbin/reboot does no longer need to be run as root, but is also happy with normal user privileges. If you use an older release where /sbin/reboot still needs to be run as root or with sudo, you must add the sudo inside the alias command:\nalias reboot='echo \"Rebooting in 10 seconds\" && sleep 10 && sudo reboot'\n\nRunning the alias itself with sudo (i.e. sudo ALIASNAME) will not work because aliases are specific to your user's Bash session.\n", "Q: How do I access Ubuntu after installing alongside Windows 10? (non eufi) I used Ubuntu on an old Chromebook for about a year and have pretty good experience using it.  I recently got an HP laptop and decided to dual-boot it between windows 10 and ubuntu (homesick, i guess. :P)\nAnyway, it all worked fine.  Installation worked and I restarted the computer--only to find no menu asking me which OS to boot into.  It just went straight to Windows 10!  \nHow do I boot into Ubuntu? \nThank you!\n\nA: Your problem is that the OS boot manager used by your computer is not set to grub, but to Windows. To fix this you need to get into the BIOS. \nIn Windows, hit the Windows key and search up \"change advanced startup options\". Hit \"enter\". \nWhen the settings window appears, click \"Restart now\" below \"advanced startup\". \nWhen the screen appears, click \"Troubleshoot\" , then \"Advanced options\", then \"UEFI Firmware settings\", then \"Restart\". \nWhen the screen loads up, click \"system setup\", \"setup\", or whatever your computer calls the BIOS. \nNext, go to wherever the boot options are, and change the OS boot manager from there, making sure the \"ubuntu\" device is above the \"Windows\" device. \nExit saving changes, and when you boot into grub you will see both OSs in the list.\nHope this works.\n", "Q: Cant install chrome no matter what I try.

There were two mplayer binaries on my system!  /usr/local/bin/mplayer was the default.  But when I tried /usr/bin/mplayer, everything worked. (Except DVBCut audio.)\nSo, I got rid of /usr/local/bin/mplayer.  sudo gzip /usr/local/bin/mplayer just in case I ever need it again.\n", "Q: What does end-to-end disk error mean? I have opened Disks program today and noticed that there is FAILING in the Assessment column for the SMART status. \n\nWhat does this error mean? Is it serious problem?\nI have Lenovo G50-45 laptop, disk is SEAGATE ST1000LM014-SSHD-8GB(LVD3) 1TB SSHD with 8GB NAND Flash (original disk in this latop).\nUpdate 2017-09-24:\nThe disk has died yesterday. 1 year and 3 months have passed since 1st hint of problem. About 4 months ago I had few issues with it not booting, but I was able to make another clean install. Since yesterday the disk is non-responsive. As this was long expected I had backup of all important data.(!) The disk was about 2 years old, so that was quite premature death.\n\nA: The end-to-end-eror is a critical attribute. Bad values here are an indicator for very soon complete disk failure.\nBack up all data as soon as possible and get a new disk!\nMore information can be found on Wikipedia, here's an excerpt:\nID:                 184 \nHex:                0xB8\nAttribute name:     End-to-End error / IOEDC    \nBetter:             Lower\nCritical:           Yes\nDescription:        This attribute is a part of Hewlett-Packard's SMART IV \n                    technology, as well as part of other vendors' IO Error \n                    Detection and Correction schemas, and it contains a count \n                    of parity errors which occur in the data path to the  \n                    media via the drive's cache RAM.\n\n\nA: According to smart status ...\n\nHard drives, supporting this attribute\nSamsung, Seagate, IBM (Hitachi), Fujitsu, Maxtor, Western Digital, Hewlett-Packard\n\nand \n\nEnd-to-End error S.M.A.R.T. parameter is a part of HP's SMART IV technology and it means that after transferring through the cache RAM data buffer, the parity data between the host and the hard drive did not match. For detailed information see SMART IV Documentation from HP.\n  Recommendations\nThis is a critical parameter. Degradation of this parameter may indicate imminent drive failure. Urgent data backup and hardware replacement is recommended.\n\n\nI would suggest getting a replacement disk. But I have seen it also before and the disk could still have a few years of life in it. \n\nA: According to the description of the failing parameter, DATA IS BEING CORRUPTED when it goes through the drive's cache. So if you plan to do ANYTHING with that disk, the first thing to do is disable that cache. Concretely: if you plan to even extract the data, first use hdparm (for example) to disable the cache. MAYBE that will allow you to extract non-corrupted data. \nAnother, more hackish option would be to extract say 3 full-disk images, and then compare them. Assuming that the corruption happens rarely (which must be the case, or you would have noticed without SMART), and in random points, then you might be able to find sectors with disagreements between the 3 images, and then you could choose the sector that is agreed on by 2 of the 3 images. This could be done with a short script.\nAbout writing to the drive: if you decide that you trust the electronics even after this problem, MAYBE you could get some use from it by again disabling the cache. It would turn pretty slow, anyway, even if you dared to trust it. I wouldn't.\n", "Q: Unable to run mksdcard SDK tool ubuntu 16, 2016 Followed How to install Android Studio on Ubuntu? to install android studio.

For whatever reason, we do no longer need to be root (or using sudo) to run /sbin/shutdown, /sbin/reboot etc.\nThis seems to be because those executables are now symlinks to /bin/systemctl which handles everything as normal user.\nHowever, what if I want shutdown and reboot to require root authentication again? How can I achieve this? \n\nA: Systemd does indeed handle the shutdown, reboot and other commands, and the default privileges assigned are permissive. To change this, you need to create a Polkit rule. Create a .pkla file in /etc/polkit-1/localauthority/50-local.d (say, confirm-shutdown.pkla) containing:\n[Confirm shutdown]\nIdentity=unix-user:*\nAction=org.freedesktop.login1.*\nResultActive=auth_admin_keep\n\nThe various shutdown, reboot, etc. commands are, in Polkit terms,  actions in org.freedesktop.login1, for example, org.freedesktop.login1.power-off, org.freedesktop.login1.reboot, etc. The specific problem here is the default configuration, which is in /usr/share/polkit-1/actions/org.freedesktop.login1.policy:\n<action id=\"org.freedesktop.login1.power-off\">\n        <description>Power off the system</description>\n        ...\n        <defaults>\n                <allow_any>auth_admin_keep</allow_any>\n                <allow_inactive>auth_admin_keep</allow_inactive>\n                <allow_active>yes</allow_active>\n        </defaults>\n\nNote that it allows the active user to power off, reboot, etc.\n\nA: You can use chmod command. \n\n\n*\n\n*If you want to give access to only root, you can write:\nchmod 700 directory/to/the/file\n\n\n*If you want to give permisson to the root and the sudo group then you can write:\nchmod 770 directory/to/the/file\n\n\n*If you want to change the group of the file from sudo to an another (like a user or admins) you need to type in:\nchown owner:group directory/to/the/file\n\n\n*If you want to revert back, run:\nchown root:sudo filedirectory \n\nNote: you may have to use sudo to these command, or have logged in the root account\n\nA: As changing permissions of a symlink on a Linux system doesn't change the permissions of the link but instead the file it points to (In Ubuntu at least). I would think the safest way to accomplish this would be to remove the link, and recreate it with the required umask to obtain the result you desire.\nAnother related post can be found here\n\nA: You can make a script that checks if user is running it with root permissions or not.\nThen it will run systemctl command or return error.\n\n#!/bin/bash\nif [ \"$(whoami)\" != \"root\" ]; then\n    echo \"Sorry, you are not root.\"\n    exit 1\nelse\n    (systemctl shutdown command)\nfi\n\nSource\n\nA: Try to change its permissions in terminal. You could make it executable only by by a certain group, such as wheel or admin. Sadly (or perhaps fortunately), a file can only have one group ownership so chown simply wouldn't work by itself. Try \"sudo chown root:wheel /sbin/shutdown\" and then \"sudo chmod g+x /sbin/shutdown\". This will make the file executable only by root and admins(shudders) and sudoers will be required to enter their passwords.\n", "Q: Pydev installation problem in eclipse I am trying to install pydev 5.0 in eclipse 3.8.1 in Ubuntu 14.04 LTS,using  Help->install new software..

Press \"M\" to\n  unmute it, if it says \"M\" at the bottom. Press the up arrow to turn\n  the volume all the way up in the headphone column. Then use the arrow\n  keys to move to the \"Speaker\" column. You probably want to turn it all\n  the way down unless you want sound to come out of the speakers and the\n  headphone jack.\n\n[UPDATE] I found a one command line to do that you can execute whenever I plug in my headphones:\namixer -c 1 set Headphone on;amixer -c 1 set Headphone 100%\n\nso to get get to that, I had \nto find the right card to use:\namixer controls\n\nto use first card and see which controls are available on that card\namixer -c 1\n\nto turn it on\namixer -c 1 set Headphone on\n\nto set volume\namixer -c 1 set Headphone 100%\n\n\nA: I went to pulse audio volume control, input devices, and UNMUTED the INTERNAL MIC and my headphones worked again.\n2016 XPS 13 Ubuntu 18.04\n\nA: After trying various different solutions on my Dell XPS 15 headphones still weren't detected, only got to use analog internal speakers (which weren't functioning before too).\nI then tried the amixer commands from @Jeremy's answer, but nothing happened and right after I executed the following from a Launchpad's user suggestion:\nrm -r ~/.config/pulse/\npulseaudio -k && sudo alsa force-reload\nsudo reboot\n\nI let the headphones connected to the jackport all the time while executing the commands and while laptop was rebooting.\nAfter the reboot headphones were reproducing sound though they are still not listed in the output devices, only internal analog speakers are listed, but the sound actually comes through the headphones. I haven't plugged off my headphones nor restarted the system ever since.\nCredit goes to user Camilo Prieto on this Launchpad bug comment.\n\nA: I have a new Dell XPS 13 9360 running Ubuntu 16.04 and the way I fixed this problem is to set the second Headphone setting in alsamixer to 22 (there are only a few levels you can set it to).\n\nA: I also have this problem with my slightly newer XPS 13 (9370), though in my case the issue is related to switching between laptop speakers and headphone output. For some reason the amplifier for the headphones doesn't always get turned on when a jack is connected.  To fix this I have to forcibly enable the amplifier.\nTo figure out what to do I compared the output of cat /proc/asound/card0/codec#0 when it was working vs non-working, and noticed a difference in the Stereo Amp-Out / HP Out at Ext Right section:\nNode 0x21 [Pin Complex] wcaps 0x40058d: Stereo Amp-Out\n Control: name=\"Headphone Playback Switch\", index=0, device=0\n   ControlAmp: chs=3, dir=Out, idx=0, ofs=0\n Amp-Out caps: ofs=0x00, nsteps=0x00, stepsize=0x00, mute=1\n Amp-Out vals:  [0x00 0x00]\n Pincap 0x0001001c: OUT HP EAPD Detect\n EAPD 0x2: EAPD\n Pin Default 0x04211020: [Jack] HP Out at Ext Right\n   Conn = 1/8, Color = Black\n   DefAssociation = 0x2, Sequence = 0x0\n Pin-ctls: 0xc0: OUT HP\n\nThe last value, Pin-ctls, is 0xc0 when the headphone jack is working, and 0x00 when it's not.  So, when the output isn't working, I flip that bit:\nsudo hda-verb /dev/snd/hwC0D0 0x21 SET_PIN_WIDGET_CONTROL 0xc0\nThe values may be different depending on the exact sound card, but this method may work for other people.\n", "Q: Select at boot time, from Grub, Nouveau or Nvidia driver I have a laptop MSI GS60 6QE; CPU is Skylake I7-6700HQ and GPU NVIDIA GTX 970.\nI had installed Ubuntu 16.04 on it and is working quiet good.\nI've installed NVIDIA 364.19 driver from ppa.launchpad.net/graphics-drivers/ppa/ubuntu\nI'm using Prime to select the graphic card.\nI noticed that when I using this configuration, over the Nouveau driver, the battery life is very short (about 1h 30mins)\nIf I using Nouveau the battery life is better (about 2:30 to 3 h).\nMy question is that I can configure Ubuntu to select at boot time, from Grub, which driver to use NVIDIA or Nouveau?\nThank you in advance for any help.\nGabriel \n\nA: You can use kernel parameters to blacklist the driver you don't want to use and force the other one.  \nmodprobe.blacklist=nvidia systemd.setenv=GPUMOD=nouveau\n\nPlus a script to modify xorg config.  \ncat > /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/01-nv.conf << EOF\nSection \"Device\"\n  Identifier   \"Device0\"\n  Driver       \"nouveau\"\nEndSection\nEOF\n\nSwitching nouveau and nvidia drivers using a single kernel and systemd\n", "Q: How do I create a shortcut to Gnome 3 Activities menu?

Maybe it can help somebody else:\nThe CPU frequency scaling works after adding acpi=off to the kernel boot parameters but there is a downside: only 1 processor core. \nTo have all cores and CPU frequency scaling one need to downgrade the kernel to 4.1.26. http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/v4.1.26-wily/ . \nAs a side note:\nUsing this kernel version I had some troubles with WiFi driver (b43).

system and also old linux images and headers. So first try\nsudo apt-get autoremove\n\nI think this will solve your problem for now.\nUPDATE\nI was bit of a hurry when I post the last answer and happy to see that helped you but seeing your last post output I don't think that freed up /boot partition completely because there were lots of old kernels occupying at least a gig of space and autoremove will not clean them. So enter in your terminal\ndpkg --list | grep linux-image\n\nand look for the entries like linux-image-x.xx.x-xx-generic and if there is more than one entry then purge the old ones one by one keeping the latest one as follows...\nsudo apt-get purge linux-image-x.xx.x-xx-generic\n\nDO IT CAREFULLY AND DON'T REMOVE THE LATEST KERNEL.\n", "Q: is there a way to move launcher to the right side of screen in 14.04?

But, the problem still continues. \nSo, to revert to my original question: How can I uninstall ubuntu and install lubuntu, without harming my windows 7 partition?\nIf anyone has a better suggestion to me, please feel free to let me know.\nThanks.\n\nA: Lubuntu just uses LXDE. You can install that alongside whatever other desktop environments you have installed.\nRun\nsudo apt-get install lubuntu-desktop\n\nto install it. Log out, look for a gear icon or Budgie logo icon, press it and select LXDE or Lubuntu Desktop before logging back in.\nFresh installs are usually better, but this is easier and takes less effort.\nIf you want to install fresh, the Ubuntu installer should have an option to Erase Ubuntu and install Lubuntu (or whatever it says). Make sure you're not selecting Erase disk!\nIf it doesn't have that option, choosing Something Else... will allow you to erase just the Ubuntu partition and then select it as the install location.\n", "Q: Cannot find Samba in Ubuntu 16.04 LTS Dash Samba, system-config-samba and everything related to Samba is installed according to Synaptic and up to date.

What did I do wrong?\nWordpress is installed in /var/www/html. My URL is dancer.ly and my IP is 127.0.0.1. Thanks!\n\nA: You are most likely installing WordPress under the wrong path. You have the following options:\nMove the files: Copy all the WordPress files from where ever you installed it to /var/www/html. \nChange the path used by apache: change the DocumentRoot in the file /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf to the path where you installed WordPress. \nCreate a new vHost: Create a new vHost, by adding another site. Copy the /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf to something like /etc/apache2/sites-available/wordpress.conf and edit it to make your changes. You can than either use a ServerName, to access the server through an URL (for example by adding it to your /etc/hosts file), or disable the default host with a2dissite 000-default. Than you need to enable your new site with a2ensite wordpress (Change wordpress to whatever you named the conf file). \nWhen you change the path or create a new vHost you need to restart apache: /etc/init.d/apache2 restart. \n \nMaybe you also left the index.html in the directory /var/www/html when installing WordPress. Apache searches for the index.html before it searches for the index.php. So you should simply delete it \n\nA: I just had the same problem as the OP. What solved it for me was clearing my browser's cache actually. I even deleted the index.html file from any directory including and under /var/www/html, and it still showed up in my browser when I navigated to my server's IP.\n\nA: That is due to multiple index files, like index.html and index.php.\nAll you need to do is to delete the index.html page in the /var/www/html folder, clear cache and reload the page, it should fix the issue.\n", "Q: I want to get ubuntu 14.04 plugins I installed 32 bit Ubuntu 14.04 OS for my computer.

Actually another suggest to prepend ./ before my command is a helpful answer as it has solved the problem.  But that solution is not found on the page marked as duplicate.\nI don't understand why I need to prepend ./ when I am already in the directory with the command ...  So I have a solution but do not understand why it is needed.\n\nA: Because the folder where that file is is not in PATH variable, and by default any command you just type into the prompt will be searched from the list of dirs in the PATH. You can type in git and run it just like that because it's located in some directory that is listed in PATH and yours is not.\nUse ·/command , give full path like /home/admin/somedir/command , or add that dir to your PATH variable. Alternative is also to make an alias to the full path.\nIn your case the last command should be\n./hex2hcd BCM43142A0_001.001.011.0084.0086.hex BCM43142A0-0a5c-21d7.hcd\n\n", "Q: Create Ubuntu OS with Installed software I'm using Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. I'm a beginner. I installed a lot of Software(Applications, Programs).\nI want to Install the same Ubuntu on another computer with the same settings as this one.\n\nA: \nBacking Up\n\nTo get started, please open up a terminal, in Ubuntu this can be done by \nCtrl + Alt + T\nSome directories require root or superuser permissions to read and write (needed for backup). For that just execute the following\nsudo su\n\nThen Type in your password. You need to have an Administrator privileged account.\nFor this example, we will change directories to root. This is where the backup will be made. This is an arbitrary decision, you should create the backup elsewhere. For instance to a mounted external hard drive, another partition or disk connected internally, even a folder in your home directory could be used. In all cases, ensure the location your saving the archive to has enough space. Simply use the cd command to navigate there.\ncd / \n\nThe following is an exemplary command of how to archive your system.\ntar -cvpzf backup.tar.gz --exclude=/backup.tar.gz --one-file-system / \n\nTo understand what is going on, we will dissect each part of the command.\ntar - is the command that creates the archive. It is modified by each letter immediately following, each is explained bellow.\nc - create a new backup archive.\nv - verbose mode, tar will print what it's doing to the screen.\np - preserves the permissions of the files put in the archive for restoration later.\nz - compress the backup file with 'gzip' to make it smaller.\nf  - specifies where to store the backup, backup.tar.gz is the filename used in this example. It will be stored in the current working directory, the one you set when you used the cd command.\n--exclude=/example/path - The options following this model instruct tar what directories NOT to backup. We don't want to backup everything since some directories aren't very useful to include. The first exclusion rule directs tar not to back itself up, this is important to avoid errors during the operation.\n--one-file-system - Do not include files on a different filesystem. If you want other filesystems, such as a /home partition, or external media mounted in /media backed up, you either need to back them up separately, or omit this flag. If you do omit this flag, you will need to add several more --exclude= arguments to avoid filesystems you do not want. These would be /proc, /sys, /mnt, /media, /run and /dev directories in root. /proc and /sys are virtual filesystems that provide windows into variables of the running kernel, so you do not want to try and backup or restore them. /dev is a tmpfs whose contents are created and deleted dynamically by udev, so you also do not want to backup or restore it. Likewise, /run is a tmpfs that holds variables about the running system that do not need backed up.\nIt is important to note that these exclusions are recursive. This means that all folders located within the one excluded will be ignored as well. \n\nRestoring\n\nYou will want to restore from a Live CD. If needed, first partition and format the drive. You can do this with gparted. Then simply mount the partition you are going to restore somewhere. If you open the drive in nautilus, it will be auto mounted somewhere under /media\nThat is, In the Backup step You should have copied the Archive to an external media (eg. Flash Drive, External Hard disk)\nTake a look to find out where with:\nls /media\n\nRestore Your Backup\nsudo tar -xvpzf /path/to/backup.tar.gz -C /media/whatever --numeric-owner\n\nA brief explanation:\nx - Tells tar to extract the file designated by the f option immediately after. In this case, the archive is /home/test/backup.tar.gz\n-C  - This option tells tar to change to a specific directory before extracting. In this example, we are restoring to the root (/) directory.\n--numeric-owner - This option tells tar to restore the numeric owners of the files in the archive, rather than matching to any user names in the environment you are restoring from. This is due to that the user id:s in the system you want to restore don't necessarily match the system you use to restore (eg a live CD).\nThis pretty much sums up what you are asking for in the question.

How can I get it back? I recently installed Ubuntu alongside Windows 10 on my Thinkpad. However, some idiot (who didn't know my password) accessed my computer while I was gone and must have messed with something because when I got back and opened my laptop, I had to type in my Bitlocker recovery key.\nNow, instead of showing me an option to boot Ubuntu or Windows, it just goes directly to Windows (after the Thinkpad BIOS screen, of course)\nThis is really weird considering that all the guides on the Internet for uninstalling Ubuntu (that I could find) required a Windows Recovery disc.\nHow can I get back the Ubuntu bootloader?\n\nA: The bootloader used in Linux and Ubuntu specifically is Grub\nBoot from Ubuntu live USB , and follow the instructions for live recovery on failed update . It will allow you making changes to the system while booting from live USB. Essential steps are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot the Ubuntu Live CD.\n\n*Press Ctrl-Alt-F1\n\n*sudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt\n\n*sudo mount --bind /dev /mnt/dev\n\n*sudo mount --bind /proc /mnt/proc\n\n*sudo mount --bind /sys /mnt/sys\n\n*sudo chroot /mnt\n\n\nFinally , you should be able to run sudo grub-install /dev/sdX where /dev/sdX is your hard drive. If you are not sure which one it is sda or sdb , run  the df or lsblk command and check which disk size corresponds to which device.\nSidenote: consider also changing  your passwords, just in case someone did break into your OS\n\nA: You just need to make a bootable USB device.

Then you need to select either IBus or fcitx in Language Support. At next login (possibly a reboot is needed; see comment by user2281135) you should be able to find the Anthy item in Text Entry.\nTo install ibus-anthy you can run the following command in a terminal:\nsudo apt-get install ibus-anthy\n\n", "Q: How are snap applications being protected? How are snap applications being protected when we look at different aspects?\n\n\n*\n\n*Runtime protections?\n\n\n*\n\n*Memory protections?\n\n*Differences to ordinary processes?\n\n*Differences to VMs?\n\n\n*Storage protections?\n\n\n*\n\n*Protections of application binaries?\n\n*Protections of persistent data?\n\n\n*Containers\n\n\n*\n\n*What does the term \"container\" mean and implicate in respect to application protection and security?\n\n*Differences to ordinary processes?\n\n*Differences to VMs?\n\n*Differences to other containers especially \"Docker\"?\n\n\n*Any other relevant protections?\n\n\nA: snapd developer here.\nThe word protections seems to imply that snapd contains some sort of DRM system to protect binaries. There's no such thing. Snapd protects your system from possibly untrusted software and various software packages from affecting each other.\nDifferences from Virtual Machines are simple, there are no virtual machines involved. Running a program in a virtual machine really runs a program, operating system and a hardware emulator as one big process on your system. Snaps don't use anything like that, they instead executed directly on top of the hardware and the kernel provided by the host system.\nDifferences from ordinary processes are just a few but they make all the difference and magic possible. Snapd uses multiple features of the Linux kernel to give snap processes (processes of started snap applications) different view of the file-system, so that they can run on top of virtually any modern distribution. In addition the interaction of such processes with the kernel and other userspace programs is controlled by a sandbox managed by snapd. The exact behaviour of the sandbox depends on the system used and the set of snap interface connections made between the snaps in the system.\nThe term container means pretty much nothing today, it is just a marketing buzzword. The linux kernel offers a wide range of tools that allows to segregate various parts of the system and make some of them appear unaffected by changes made by other processes elsewhere. This may range from \"it looks like another machine\" to \"it looks like this machine\" and is constantly evolving and expanding in scope of what can be done.\nDifferences from other \"containers\" like docker is the set of those primitives used. Specifically snapd uses the device cgroup, the freezer cgroup, the seccomp BPF filter to constrain system calls and a large set of apparmor profiles to constrain access to IPC mechanisms, networking mechanisms, signals, capabilities, read, write and other access to files on the system. Docker or other \"containers\" typically use different set of such kernel features and configure them differently.\nFrom a purely perception difference snapd is designed to integrate with the host. If you snap install a service it will be directly visible to your machine's service manager (systemd). If you snap install a CLI application you will be able to run it mostly like any other application on your host. If you snap install a graphical application it will integrate with you launcher, panels and other typical controls. This is not the case for docker which is designed to allow you to run, typically, headless network payloads and leave the integration to the user.\nAs for data protection snapd manages and retains application data between revisions to allow users to revert to a prior working revision as well as contains default permissions that limit access to potentially sensitive access to certain files in the home directory. Still most of the home directory is currently allowed as the mechanisms to mediate access are incomplete or immature. Over time that access will be restricted and only granted through fine-grained mediation.\nThere's a sophisticated white paper about snapd security model that I could recommend for far more details than those that I presented here: https://developer.ubuntu.com/static/resources/ubuntu-core-16-security-whitepaper.pdf\n\nA: \"Still most of the home directory is currently allowed as the mechanisms to mediate access are incomplete or immature. Over time that access will be restricted and only granted through fine-grained mediation.\"\nTo provide a little more context for this, by default the snap is only allowed to access its own data and system resources that are considered safe. The snap developer is able to request other resources (known as \"interfaces\" in snapd) and some are automatically granted and others are granted by the user. Zygmunt is referring to the \"home\" interface here and snaps do not have it by default, but a snap developer may request it. This home interface is considered a transitional interface to support certain traditional use cases and it is automatically granted on traditional (aka classic) distributions (as opposed to distributions like Ubuntu Core where it is not auto-connected) and the user may choose to revoke it. As Zygmunt points out, over time use of the home interface will be restricted and access to the user's data will only granted through fine-grained mediation.\n", "Q: Install custom Ubuntu iso from network card I have a few customized Ubuntu ISOs (based in Ubuntu 12.04) that I need to install in a SBC embedded in an enclosure. Until now, I have to open the enclosure, connect a screen, keyboard and a USB installer every time the ISO needs updated. The user needs to manually introduce data during the installation.\nI was hoping to use the network card to install the ISO. \nI've read the Ubuntu installation guide. In my situation, without a keyboard or screen, I think the installation over ssh is the only available solution. However, it's a very manual process and I would have to redo lots of configuration and packing done to create the ISOs.\nIs there a way to run a PXE server and run the installation from it like I was using ssh -X to forward the screen?\nAny pointers to a solution are welcome, including the use of additional hardware.\nI had partial success with FOG. I can clone and restore the system using the network card only. I can also add an ISO image as part of the boot menu. I couldn't get the right settings to automatically boot from it, accept my custom preseed file and then use a kickstart file for the rest of the questions that my preseed is still going to ask.\nEdit: A similar question was asked here. The main difference is that I don't have access to serial or USB ports, therefore the currently accepted answer is not valid for me. I do have a working installation from the first deployment and an ssh installation is possible in my system. I was hoping for something automated to avoid mistakes. Using my existing ISO files and ideally, something that someone with no experience in Linux could do. \n\nA: PXE is the way to go here , however your device will need to support network booting and have that enabled in the BIOS.

I managed to create a snap that contains the jre, my server and the service startup. Everything works fine.\nThe snap file results in 106MB which is mainly java. I was wondering if there is a way to share the java installation between servers? So that my snap files become very small only containing specific code for my installation?\nIn my head this would sort of look like this:\nSnap 1: A snap that contains the Java runtime and exposes java for others to use. I believe slots are used for that, but I am not 100% sure on that.\nSnap 2: Server A that only contains my jars and uses the java runtime of Snap 1.\nSnap 3: Like Snap 2 but with different jars.\nI would have Snap 2 and 3 depend on Snap 1, so that if someone installs Snap 2, it would automatically install Snap 1. If Snap 1 is installed, it will skip that and simply use it?\nI am not sure if this is supported or if this is even meant to work that way?\n\nA: Yes, there will soon be a mechanism for you to share files in one of your snaps with other snaps that you made. Look out for the \"content interface\" in the next few weeks.\nThere will also be delta updates for snaps, which will reduce the upload / download for a given snap, but that's a separate matter. \n\nA: From @didrocks answer:\nThis mecanism isn't available as of today (we may introduce one in the future, with the 3 separated snaps as you infer, but this isn't available now). Another option you can seek if, if snap 2 and 3 are tightly coupled, you can have one snap containing the jvm, and your 2 services. Then, some configuration to choose what to start (service 1, service 2 or the two of them).\nUpdate:\nI just saw: Will snap packages get differential (delta) updates? which essentially solves the issue I think. My worry was that I would have to repackage the JRE each time I publish a new version of my software. With delta update (which I yet have to work out how to do) this problem vanishes. I am happy for 1 package to have its own JRE whilst it is reusing it. \nEdit again: As of now (20 June 2016) the delta updates are not released yet but are experimented on and will likely come soon.

Why does this happen? How to resolve this bug?\n\nA: The issue you have with your LapTop is a known problem with some Dell LapTops.\nWhen you resume from suspend on battery power, the Dell bios will set Clock Modulation to be used as a way to limit performance a little to save battery power. The problem is that the intel_pstate CPU frequency scaling driver, in its current form, is incompatible with Clock Modulation, and instead of limiting performance a little it drivers the CPU frequency hard down to below its normal lower limit.\nThe suggested solution for you is that you disable the intel_pstate driver, and use the acpi-cpufreq CPU frequency scaling driver instead. The acpi-cpufreq driver responds \"properly\" to Clock Modulation.\nIf you are using grub, then edit /etc/default/grub and change the GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT line. Example, where I have something else on that line:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"ipv6.disable=1 intel_pstate=disable\"\n\nBe sure to run sudo update-grub afterwards. It is also good practice to save a copy of the original file before you edit it.

Simply generate a live usb stick using boot-repair-disk and boot from the stick. Of course you should have already saved all your files. Who knows what might happen...\nEdit: You can generate the live stick by using for example unetbootin.\n", "Q: How to run as root on a Raspberry Pi? I just got a raspberry pi and got an image from school where we had to change the IP address to something else, by mistake instead of having auto lo in my /etc/network/interfaces file, I have 4auto lo. This is a huge problem because now I can't connect to my Raspberry Pi with putty. I connected it directly to a screen but I don't have a USB keyboard to connect as well. I tried changing the file but I need to be root for that, then I thought maybe I could use sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces in bash but I can't press enter or any key that does that. Now is there any way I can use a mouse to get root permission and change the file so that I can continue my homework?\n\nA: When you have made changes to a Raspberry Pi OS and it will not boot, there is no way of using a LiveUSB system to correct it, as you would on any other Ubuntu machine. Fortunately, it's easy to pull out the SD card and change it from another computer with a card reader.\nOn the SD card there will be two partitions. The first one is /boot; it contains a FAT file system, which a Windows computer can read. Unfortunately, your Raspberry Pi ´root´ file system is on the other partition. This is an ext4 file system, which cannot be read by Windows. If a Windows computer is all you have available, you have two options:\n\n\n*\n\n*install ext2fsd, which is small Windows program that acts as a device driver for the card. When installed, it will allow you to read and write files on the Raspberry Pi root partition.\n\n*use a LiveUSB (stick, or drive) to boot your Windows computer into a Ubuntu live session. (Choose \"Try Ubuntu\".). Your Windows drive will not be modified. The Raspberry Pi card will show up as an external drive.\nIf you have a Linux computer, things are much easier because Linux can read the ext4 root partition straightaway.\nCorrect the mistake, unmount the card safely, and reboot the Raspberry Pi.\n", "Q: Lost all hdd partitions. Formatting fails I lost all partition hard drive (1 TB). It's completely formatted. Now it's in ext4 file system. I cannot make partition from that 1 TB.

Either boot from a LiveCD and make the changes you want on your disk or, as Rinzwind said, do a clean install.\nIf this disk is not your system disk, you can also unmount it before you start making this kind of changes.\nIf it is, reboot as instructed by fdisk for the changes to be used.\n", "Q: Drop (copy) Previous mySql Tables Dir into upgrade MariaDB Directory I've finally moved over to MariaDB from mySql 5.6 on my Ubuntu 16.04 (upgrade from 15.10). I have about a dozen previous web data tables sets (Drupal v7.4x) which are current and still in use on my localhost (LAMP). I have sql backups, but I'm not sure if I can (or should) simply drop the old DB tables from the previous mySQL5.6 directory/folder into the newly created MariaDB dir. I'm not afraid to try or merely drop them into the dir, I just don't want to then spend more time fixing problems which I cannot foresee at the present.\nIf 'importing' rather than 'dropping in' the data-table SQL is the best approach then so be it, but my question is:\nWhat is the best approach to upgrading SQL to MariaDB? \nThanks in advance for any advice on this.\n\nA: Yes, that would be the easiest. Just dump the databases using mysqldump and use mysql command line to import the databases. If there are any problems (like an invalid definer) you will get a notice and can fix it by editing the dump. \n", "Q: terminal x clipboard 0~ prepended 1~ added With the X clipboard, I often have 0~ prepended and 1~ added to it.\nThat seems to happen often in gnome-terminal.\nSo in a terminal, let's say I highlight abc, then when I middle click, it will become 0~abc1~. Issuing a reset solves the problem, but it tends to come back rather quickly again, and seems much more frequent since 16.04 somehow.\nAny pointer greatly appreciated.\n\nA: This problem seems to be due to \"bracketed paste mode\". \nA fix is to issue a printf \"\\e[?2004l\" (I put an alias for it).

(Assuming you've got a good CPU cooler).\nIf you are using the stock cooler, I highly recommend you go to your local Microcenter and pick up a Cooler Master Hyper 212 EVO.\nWhen you say the software \"burnt your motherboard\", did you meant that it overheated and the CPU was fried?\nIf so, that was probably caused by the fan not spinning at all. I experienced that issue on an Acer Aspire laptop, and the fix was to simply update the BIOS. After doing so, the fan worked normally and temps were fine.\nSoftware alone cannot fry electronics. Prime 95 can't fry your CPU just by itself. The Motherboard/CPU can decide whether to thermal throttle or not. And it isn't Prime 95 that applies a vCore boost when running with AVX...\n", "Q: Ping from subinterface I have interface eth0:0\nauto eth0:0 iface eth0:0 inet static\n        address 192.168.2.96\n        netmask 255.255.255.0\n        gateway 192.168.2.1\n\nand I try this:\nping -I eth0:0 8.8.8.8\n\nand I get this\nping: SO_BINDTODEVICE: Invalid argument\n\nIf I try to ping from eth0 everything is OK.

I am trying to install MS Office 2013 on my ubuntu 16.04 laptop. I have been searching all over the web and haven't found anything useful. Please help!\n\nA: WPS Office looks just like MS Office. And it works fine in Ubuntu.  \nGet the deb package from here: http://wps-community.org/. Then open a Terminal window and type: sudo apt-get install gdebi. After gdebi is installed, close the Terminal, right-click on wps office deb file and choose open with gdebi. Wait for the installation to finish and that's it. And yes, it is free for linux, despite of what some 'wiseshots' may think.\n\nA: Contrary to what answers here say, you cannot get anything above Office 2010 to run. (Information from personal experience and research a few months ago, so something may have changed.)\nIt just requires too much for WINE (PlayOnLinux is just a wrapper for WINE) to handle, and will crash before launch.\nLike others have suggested, you can use Office Online, but that doesn't work if you use an offline key. Your only options in this are either using 2010 or trying out Open Office or Libre Office.\n\nA: You can't. MS Office only runs on Windows (and Mac OS).\nYou could try running it on WINE, but no guarantees.\nWINE stands for Wine Is Not an Emulator\nIt is a compatibility layer that allows running Win32 apps on Linux.\nHowever, it is FAR from perfect. Many applications will will simply crash during install or on launch.\n\nYou can install wine with:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install wine\n\nThen you can try installing office by double-clicking the setup EXE.\nIt will probably crash during install.\n\nAn alternative is Office Online.\n", "Q: what does this mean for a module to have a bad taint?

Is it something about netcat, or maybe about bash syntax? Please let me know what I am getting wrong. \n\nA: The problem has nothing to do with nc or netcat or any of their ilk. You are running two commands here, nc and grep, but only redirecting the output of grep. What you want to do is:\nnc -zv 1.2.3.4 55  &>/dev/null\n\nThat, of course, would be pointless since if there's no output, you can't grep. That's what grep's -q flag is for:\n   -q, --quiet, --silent\n          Quiet;   do   not  write  anything  to  standard  output.   Exit\n          immediately with zero status if any match is found, even  if  an\n          error was detected.  Also see the -s or --no-messages option.\n\nSo, what you're after is something like this:\nnc -zv 1.2.3.4 55 2>/dev/null | grep -q \" open \" && start_daemon\n\nOr, if you need to parse stderr as well, this:\nnc -zv 1.2.3.4 55  |& grep -q \" open \" && start_daemon\n\n\nA: Managed to get the script running properly using netcat's nc's exit status, while running it without -v option. Anyway, it seems that netcat's netcat's output doesn't get piped into grep. I suppose it might be caused by some sort of forking.\nUPDATE:\nAs terdon mentioned in a comment to his answer, part of output from nc / netcat is printed to stderr, part to stout. So merging these two files before piping to grep does the trick:\nnetcat -zvw1 1.2.3.4 55 2>&1 | grep \"open\"\n", "Q: Software and Updater consumes 100% CPU in Ubuntu 16.04 I've upgraded my laptop (Lenovo Z50-70) which has an i7 CPU and 8Gigs of Ram to Ubuntu 16.04 from 15.10. I've been installing updates consistently. I'm using ubuntu with Gnome desktop environment (GDM).\nLately I've been experiencing a weird problem, my CPU (including all 4 cores) are 100% used by some processes like gnome-software(Gnome software) and fwupd(Firmware update daemon). This makes my work goes down. If i even kill those processes, they are starting back again. \nIs there a solution for these processes to not utilize 100% of my CPU. And I don't want answers saying use the cpulimit utility to provision the amount of CPU for those processes. I find this a core problem in Ubuntu, i'm expecting real solutions for the problem. \nWhat I've tried so far is,\nRemoving those PPA's i've added except the official PPA's for checking updates. That didn't work out!\nAttached a screenshot of htop screen of these processes.\n\n\nA: I had exactly the same issue, same processes taking 100% of CPU. What worked for me was to upgrade software in my Ubuntu (16.04):\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\n\nAfter that I rebooted my pc and now the issue is gone.\n\nA: I managed to solve it by checking syslog (/var/log/syslog). It was logging like crazy that it couldn't create the file /home/<my user>/.cache/dconf/user. When I gave this folder the correct permissions, it stopped using this much CPU.\n\nA: Had a similar issue. \nAs the other answer mentioned - it is possible to determine the problem by looking at /var/log/syslog.\nWithin my log gnome-settings was reporting the following:\n(gnome-settings-daemon:3584): dconf-CRITICAL **: unable to create file '/home/USER/.cache/dconf/user': Permission denied.\n\nIn order to fix this I ran the following command, replace USER with your username:\nsudo chown USER /home/USER/.cache/dconf\n\n\nA: Permission Problem for me.\nlooking at:\n$ cat /var/log/syslog\n\n\n(gnome-software:3812): dconf-CRITICAL **: unable to create file\n  '/home/{user}/.cache/dconf/user': Permiso denegado.  dconf will not\n  work properly.\n\nExecuting this command, the problem solved.\n$ sudo chown {user} /home/{user}/.cache/dconf\n\n\nA: There can be a case when there's nothing in the syslog related to the service, in which case you may want to simply restart it. To avoid looking up services and killing them manually, you can just use systemctl:\nsudo systemctl restart fwupd\n\n\nA: This problem with fwupd happened to me today on one computer. I also had two instances of gnome-software running. In all, 2 CPU were clamped at 100%.\nTo quickly stop that mayhem, I could just kill those 3 processes:\nps -ef | less\n(find processes in the list, record their PID)\n\nkill <pid1>\nkill <pid2>\nkill <pid3>\n...\n\n(You may also try killall gnome-software and killall fwupd, I just find that killall command dangerous...

And indeed, I had several files in the apt cache that were total crap (i.e. my Internet connection failed a couple of days ago and some of the cache files included an HTTP 302 error instead of the expected package lists.) I find this specific comment interesting because a bug is still there, but not due to the yaml file as specified there. In my case, I could not find any yaml file anywhere.\nI'd bet that by fixing the apt-get cache, I fixed the problem. It looks like the code was fixed a while back already. I just need a reboot to confirm that this 100% CPU usage does not occur again.\n\nA: Same problem with me, it also blocking my system.\nAfter change owner of /home/{user}/.cache/dconf/user, it looks normal.\n", "Q: How to install Python 3.5.1 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS?

I greatly dislike the user interface changes between the version of gthumb in 16.04 and the version that was in 14.04.  But the deal breaker is this \"loading original image\" dialog box that pops up whenever you try to edit anything, takes forever, and cannot be dismissed.\nCan I revert to the version of gthumb from 14.04?  And if so, how?\n\nA: Fascinating, people are mostly after upgrades rather than downgrades! In your case you want to revert from Xenial's version 3.4.3 to Trusty's version 3.3.1 which is easy enough to do with a few relatively straightforward steps:\nActivate Sources\nGive access to the Sources used to build the gthumb package by following the trail below and clicking on the Source Code box at Dash → Software & Updates → Ubuntu Software → Source Code.\nClose and allow to reload. Then install the build dependencies for gthumb:\nsudo apt-get build-dep gthumb\n\nDownload and build gthumb\nCopy the following and paste complete in a Terminal window for a semi-automated download, compile and install:\nsudo apt-get install checkinstall\nNEW_PATH=\"$HOME/Desktop/gthumb_build\"\nmkdir -v \"$NEW_PATH\"\ncd \"$NEW_PATH\"\nwget http://ftp.acc.umu.se/pub/gnome/sources/gthumb/3.3/gthumb-3.3.1.tar.xz &&\ntar xvf gthumb-3.3.1.tar.xz\ncd gthumb-3.3.1\n./configure\nmake\nsudo checkinstall --pakdir \"$NEW_PATH\" \\\n     --backup=no --deldoc=yes --pkgname gthumb --pkgversion 3.3.1 \\\n     --fstrans=no --deldesc=yes --delspec=yes --default\n\nPin this particular version\nYou will need to avoid the newer version being installed over your compiled version next time you run an update. There are a few different ways to accomplish this, easiest way is to run the following:\necho \"gthumb hold\" | sudo dpkg --set-selections\n\nAnd now the older version will not be upgraded with your next system update!

My system is 14.04 and when I open the System Monitor application then click on the % CPU header the sort indicator is opposite. When the wide end is on top, lower utilization process are shown first and when the wide end is on the bottom the high utilization processes are shown at top. What would cause this?\nEdit: My 12.04 install sort the way I see as correct - when the fat part is on the top the high utilization processes are at the top.\n\nA: The arrow indicates the direction of the sort, starting with zero.\nIf the arrow points down, it'll start from 0 and go up as you go down the list.\nIf the arrow points up, it'll start from the highest and work its way to zero.  Or another way of thinking of it is that it'll start from the bottom at zero and work its way up.\n", "Q: Battery capacity below 100% in Dell laptop and battery misbehaving I just bought a Dell Inspiron 15 5000 laptop with a AMD A10-8700P CPU. I removed Windows 10 and installed Ubuntu 16.04.\nWhen plugged in, at random times, the battery icon will appear showing that the charge is below 100% and that the battery is charging. This happens even when the laptop has been plugged in for quite a while and it's still plugged in.\nWhen the battery is being used, it drains very rapidly (less than one hour) even if I'm just using Google Chrome. Sometimes when using the battery, the laptop will simply shutdown even if it hasn't reached a low percentage.\nAfter unplugging the laptop, it will often sow ridiculous times until full discharge. Example: I just unplugged it after being fully charged, and it shows 17hs left.\nIf I check the energy status, I see that the battery capacity is at 78.1%. Is this normal for a brand new laptop? Is my battery dying? How can I check for this?

I work with digital media, and know a little code, and build my own computers, but I am by no means a terminal savvy code wiz. I wanted to try out using some recent neural network projects from GitHub for some art projects, but they've only been built for Unix, so I decided to make a persistent USB drive. \nI made one, but the maximum storage you can give it, with casper-rw, is 4 gigs. The neural network takes up about 6 gigs of space, so I needed to make a larger size. I tried expanding the size using gpart, but ran into some problems. So I decided to just start over, format es4 and just do a full install on the USB drive. I tried this, and it I got some weird error messages. I did research online and it seems to have something to do with UEFI or something like that? I'm supposed to disable it. But that isn't working. If I disable UEFI I just get a blank black screen with a blinking underscore. If I don't then I get this:  \n\nPlease ignore the dorky reflection. I did not know any other way to take a screenshot of my tablet monitor while in a boot mode like that. \nI was able to get the live cd usb persistent thing working fine, it's this full install on the usb drive that isn't working. I thought about also doing an install on an external usb ssd drive I have, but I'd really prefer if I could get this 32gig flash drive working with a persistent Linux since I have some other things I'd like a portable persistent desktop drive for. Any thoughts?\n\nA: Which Ubuntu release are we talking about?  The Ubuntu 16.04 install media dropped persistence, but an older 14.04 release still has it.  If you just made another partition with a FAT filesystem on the install media, labeled it \"casper-rw\", and edited the grub boot command to add the wrord \"persistent\" to the linux kernel line, it might work though (never tried it).  \nThe full install probably needs an EFI partition (300M FAT fs, boot flag) to install grub to, although the Ubuntu intaller still ignores the location and puts the Ubuntu bootloaders on the hard disk (and maybe messes up the nvram boot entries too).  Lots of answers posted about just copying all the hard disk's EFI directories/files to the USB, then copying /EFI/ubuntu/grubx64.efi and shimx64.efi to /EFI/Boot and rename shimx64.efi to bootx64.efi.\n", "Q: Software Center doesn't load any app The new software center worked for some time for me but now wouldn't fetch anything from it's database.

I am using an MSI Z170A motherboard and two 512GB M.2 drives. My goal is to RAID-0 both drives, and split the single RAID volume into three partitions - one for Windows 10, one for Ubuntu, and one shared. \nIn order to do so, I first loaded Windows 10 from a flash drive, and during the install process loaded the Intel RST drivers from the same flash driver. Instead of continuing to install Windows, I rebooted, and in the BIOS set up the RAID volume. I rebooted again, and this time I created the three partitions on the single RAID volume, before finishing the installation of Windows 10 on one of those partitions.\nNow, I am trying to install Ubuntu 16.04 from a flash drive created by Rufus. I can successfully boot from the flash drive; however, when I try to proceed with the installation, Ubuntu does not see any usable volumes to install itself on. \nI'm aware of the mdadm utility, but am unsure of both (1) where and how to actually use it and (2) whether or not it will actually recognize the software RAID I've created; my goal isn't to create a new RAID volume, but to recognize an existing one. If this isn't possible given my current configuration, I'd like to figure out how to accomplish my overall goal of having a dual boot machine running on a striped RAID-0.\n\nA: Sometimes it's better to tell a user:\nPlease don't do this!\nMy machine came pre-installed with an Intel RST RAID-0 Windows 10 installation and the first thing I did was did was to remove the RAID-0 as no RAID is better then RAID-0!!!\nI followed the following steps to accomplish this:\n\n*\n\n*Take a CloneZilla Live UEFI backup of the pre-installed Windows 10 environment on an external disk.\n\n\n*Download RTSCLI64 V 13.2.0_1016\n\n\n*Patch it to ignore driver version checking.\n\n\n*Boot into the Windows 10 Recovery environment command prompt and delete the RAID array with the patched RSTCLI64:\n  rstcli64 --manage --delete OEMRAID0 \n\n\n\n*Now you have 2 SSDs with a size exactly half of your original RAID-0.\n\n\n*Restore the CloneZilla Image to my first SSD by editing the sda-pt.parted file to allow it to be restored onto a smaller disk\n\n\n*Start gparted live to allow gparted to fix the unallocated space as I did not calculate the exact dimensions of the disk.\n\n\n*installed Ubuntu on my second SSD.\nIf you insist on living dangerously there is only one option if you want dual boot:\n1. Take a full system backup using CloneZilla Live as you've partitioned space using Windows tools already.\n2. Boot into Ubuntu Live by using Try Ubuntu.\n3. Open a terminal.\n4. Run the command dmraid --erase_metadata --raid_devices /dev/XdY where X and Y denote the SSDs you're using\n5. Install Ubuntu using the install icon of your live session.\nAnd most important of all: Don't come back and complain you've crashed and burned: Restore your CloneZilla Backup instead.\n", "Q: No module named pygame I have two Ubuntu VMs. On one of them, I can't seem to install PyGame.

You can check which executable is getting run using the command\nwhich python\n\nIt should report something like /usr/bin/python. This is the system's Python installation that is preinstalled and which is maintained by your package manager (apt). \nIf you use that to install Python packages or if you use this installation's pip, they will all install their modules in the system's Python installation.

The data in an instance store persists only during the lifetime of its associated instance. If an instance reboots (intentionally or unintentionally), data in the instance store persists. However, data in the instance store is lost under the following circumstances:\n\n*\n\n*The underlying disk drive fails\n\n*The instance stops\n\n*The instance terminates\n\nTherefore, do not rely on instance store for valuable, long-term data. Instead, you can build a degree of redundancy (for example, RAID 1/5/6), or use a file system (for example, HDFS and MapR-FS) that supports redundancy and fault tolerance. You can also back up data periodically to more durable data storage solutions such as Amazon S3 or Amazon EBS.\n\n\nA: After sudo chown <awsuser> /mnt\nchattr -i /mnt\n\nIt makes changes permanent and revertible only by root.\n", "Q: Virtualbox failed to install?

Occasionally she refuses to sleep. Some people tell me this is the way life is, some people tell me I need to buy things to fix it. This is becoming an alarmingly common pattern in this parenting game.\nAnyway one of these things \"I need to buy\" is a white noise generator. White noise defined as:\n\na random signal is considered \"white noise\" if it is observed to have a flat spectrum over the range of frequencies that is relevant to the context. For an audio signal, for example, the relevant range is the band of audible sound frequencies, between 20 to 20,000 Hz.\n\nThere are several things I can buy. Apps for Android, dedicated boxes that I'm sure just play a tiny clip of pre-generated noise, all the way to mega-expensive true-random white noise generators.\nI want to generate my own white noise sample\nI know I could download one with youtube-dl from one of the many videos out there but copyright aside, frequency compression is horrible online I want full-white-frequency goodness. If such a thing actually exists. Plus I'm a glutton for punishment and I believe that if something can be done via the command line, that's the way we should be doing it. That's how I aim to raise this one anyway.\nSo we have things like /dev/urandom and paplay. Is there a sensible way to take random data and channel it into the audible range of white noise and out of my speakers? Answers that write to file are okay too. The important thing is a steady range-confined sample. No squawks.\nNote: answers that generate the brown note will not be appreciated ☹\n\nA: FFMpeg has an audio noise source filter.  You can play it using ffplay:\nffplay -f lavfi -showmode 0 -i 'anoisesrc=color=brown'\n\nThe arg to -i is interpreted as a lavfi filter graph, because of -f lavfi.  -showmode 0 disables ffplay's default audio visualizer window, which it shows by default for audio-only inputs.\nAs you can see from the output of ffmpeg -h filter=anoisesrc, you get a choice of brown/pink/white noise at whatever amplitude and samplerate you like, optionally with a finite duration.\n\nYou can also use mpv, a nice fork of mplayer, or other players that allow ffmpeg filtergraphs.  e.g.\nmpv  av://lavfi:anoisesrc=color=brown\n\nThis might be handy if you have a custom audio-output setup configured for your favourite player.\n\nA: The installed-by-default utility speaker-test generates pink noise (which, as @nightingale, is what you really want, not white noise).  It can be set to do so indefinitely by running \nspeaker-test -l 0\n\n\nA: I see that nobody has used aplay yet so try the following:\naplay --channels=2 --format=S16_LE --rate=44100 --duration=3600 /dev/urandom\n\nIt is not terribly imaginative so I have added in a timer to compensate :). The duration settings is in seconds so this will run for 1 hour and then turn off, hopefully the baby will have settled by then...\n\nA: You can generate pink noise using the play command from the sox utilities:\nsudo apt-get install sox\nplay -t sl -r48000 -c2 -n synth -1 pinknoise .1 60\n\nAdjust the values of .1 and 60 to suit your needs. Pink noise is less harsh on the ear and is hopefully the sound you require\n\nA: Tom Swiss of unreasonable.org uses the following code (using sox) to generate white/pink noise. You'll need to first install sox (sudo apt install sox), then create a shell script with the following code:\n#!/bin/sh\n\nlen='7:00:00'\n\nif [ \"$1\" != '' ]; then\n  len=$1\nfi\n\nplay -t sl - synth $len  pinknoise band -n 1200 200 tremolo 20 .1 < /dev/zero\n\nHat tip http://unreasonable.org/white_noise_generator_with_sox_for_Linux\nDisclaimer: I have not tried this myself yet\n\nA: White noise is mathematically an even distribution of frequencies. You can produce it with random data from /dev/random or /dev/urandom. If you want to change the \"tone\" of the produced noise (for example to make it less \"weighty\" by removing lower frequencies, or to make it \"damper\" by removing higher frequencies) then you could use a command such as dd bs=1 if=/dev/urandom of=whitenoise.raw count=1048576 to generate some white noise, then import it into Audacity and use the high-pass and low-pass filters to adjust it to your liking (when using the filters remember that the average human ear will hear frequencies up to 20kHz).\nEDIT: Audacity can also generate white noise itself.\n\nA: Not sure that this will produce real white noise that covers the whole spectrum, but a simple\npacat /dev/urandom\n\nseems to do the trick on my system (no need to install anything new or add a repository).\n\nA: Low-pass Brown noise\nSounds to me like a far away storm or a giant river/waterfall. Feel free to adjust frequency parameter 1k in Hz, filter poles -1 or -2, and output volume as gain parameter in dB.\nplay -n synth brownnoise lowpass -1 1k gain -10\n\n\nA: Use the Swiss army knife for sound generation, SoX.\nYou install it from the official repositories, simply by typing:\nsudo apt-get install sox\n\n\nUpdated, fancy answer (pleasing ocean waves):\nAfter experimenting a bit with SoX, I came up with this great command which imitates the soft murmur of the sea with its soothing sound of waves that flow over a flat sandy beach on a sunny summer day...\nWell, enough poetry, here's the command. Listen yourself.\nplay -n synth brownnoise synth pinknoise mix synth sine amod 0.3 10\n\nExplanation:\nThis command first generates and mixes brown noise and pink noise, which I find to be the most comfortable and natural noise. Then it generates a sine wave of 0.3 Hz with an offset of 10% and uses this to modulate the amplitude of our mixed noises to produce the sound of ocean waves.\nModifications:\n\n\n*\n\n*Timer:\nYou can add a timer and limit the playback duration by specifying the number of seconds, the number of minutes and seconds (mm:ss) or the number of hours, minutes and seconds (hh:mm:ss) right before brownnoise. Here's an example for one hour:\nplay -n synth 1:0:0 brownnoise synth pinknoise mix synth sine amod 0.3 10\n\n\n*Wave frequency:\nIf you want the waves to hit the beach more or less frequent, simply change the frequency of the sine wave used for amplitude modification (0.3 in the above command). The number represents the amount of waves per second, so a frequency of 0.1 Hz will cause 0.1 waves per second and therefore make one wave last for 10 seconds:\nplay -n synth brownnoise synth pinknoise mix synth sine amod 0.1 10\n\n\n*Minimum background noise volume:\nThe sine that is used for amplitude modulation got shifted to an offset of 10%, so the brown-pink noise will always be played with at least 10% volume. If you want a stronger or weaker background noise, increase or decrease this offset to your needs. Here's an example with 20% background noise:\nplay -n synth brownnoise synth pinknoise mix synth sine amod 0.3 20\n\n\nOld, boring answer (plain white noise):\nNow the easiest command to play white noise infinitely (until you abort it with Ctrl+C) is this:\nplay -n synth whitenoise\n\nIf you prefer a time limit, you may add that in the format hh:mm:ss. The following command would make noise for one and a half hour, for example:\nplay -n synth 01:30:00 whitenoise\n\nIt even shows you some nice stats while \"playing\":\n$ play -n synth 00:00:05 whitenoise \n\n  Encoding: n/a           \n  Channels: 1 @ 32-bit   \nSamplerate: 48000Hz      \nReplaygain: off         \n  Duration: unknown      \n\nIn:0.00% 00:00:05.12 [00:00:00.00] Out:240k  [!=====|=====!] Hd:0.0 Clip:0    \nDone.\n\n\nA: I'm a glutton for punishment, so I'll give you the GUI way.  Take a look at ANoise.  \nThe default sound that it comes with is bad, but you can download other sounds like Forest Rain, Fountain, & Others.  You can set it to start with the system, and even set it to stop after a certain time. \nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:costales/anoise\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install anoise\n\nANoise Code, And for For extra river sound:\nsudo apt-get install anoise-community-extension1\n\n\nA: Open Audacity.\nGo into \"Generate > Noise...\"\nSelect \"Brownian\" (way less aggressive than actual white noise). Amplitude and duration does not matter much.\nLoop using Shift+Play button.\n\nA: There's also Renoise, a very powerful multi-platform audio sequencer, though the full version is commercial. The demo version however doesn't have many limitations, and will let you do what you want, and add filters, effects, etc. to the generated sound.\nhttp://www.renoise.com\nTrue white noise with a lowpass filter, and maybe some chorus and reverb added for a nice natural effect, would sound quite pleasing.\n\nA: *\n\n*Take any old radio, tune into a frequency where there's no station, maybe (if possible) remove or collapse the antenna and turn it on.\n\n*Use aplay /dev/random. It will generate white noise and play it. I don't think you have speakers powerful enough to output infrasound (e.g. brown noise) at enough decibels to cause problems, as you don't even have very big effects with 120db and I don't think you get anywhere near that with your speakers.\n\n", "Q: Thunar doesn't display thumbnails for most files On Xubuntu 14.04 Thunar doesn't show thumbnails for most files.

The two commands below ensure this:\nsudo chown root: /usr/local/bin/SCRIPTNAME\nsudo chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/SCRIPTNAME\n\n\n*Run your script and enjoy:\nNow you can simply type SCRIPTNAME (or however you called it) to your terminal and the script will get executed.\n\nA: While writing scripts is a very convenient way to execute many commands from one file , I would suggest using functions where it requires just one or two commands.\nTake for example function definition bellow\ncompile()\n{\n  gcc \"$1\" -o \"${1%%.*}\" && printf \"<<< Compiled successfully\\n\"\n}\n\nBy placing it into your .bashrc file (and then running source ~/.bashrc or opening new terminal tab) , you can run  this command from anywhere without having ~/bin added to your PATH variable, and provide a filename as command line argument like so\ncompile somecode.c\n\nOn a side note, you can edit that file just by calling gedit ~/.bashrc from command line\nFor those of you wondering what does \"$1\" and \"${1%%.*}\" , the \"$1\" refers to the first command line parameter ( in this case \"somecode.c\" ), as for \"${1%%.*}\" - that's parameter expansion , particularly the one that does suffix removal , and will throw away anything after the dot. In other words , that turns somecode.c into somecode  . For more info, read bash manual page section about parameter expansion\n\nA: Before getting into this, I wanted to clarify that you're not creating new commands, you're creating scripts that can be run as executables.  But they can behave in the same way as a command because you can run them from anywhere.\nIf you don't have a folder in your home folder called \"bin\", create one.\nNow open a terminal window and type nano ~/.bashrc.\nThis will open an editor. At the bottom of this file, add a new line that says PATH=\"$HOME/bin:$PATH\".\nNow save the file by pressing CTRL+O (the letter o, not zero), then press ENTER.  Exit the editor with CTRL+X.  Logout and back in for changes to take effect, or restart your computer if that doesn't work.\nNow any scripts you create in your bin folder will be accessible anywhere in a terminal window.\nYou can create these scripts with either nano, or gedit (the Ubuntu graphical text editor) or any text editor you wish.  Just remember to save your script in the ~/bin folder and make your file executable.  There 2 ways to do this:\nGUI : Right click the file and go to the permissions tab, and check the box \"Allow executing as a program\".\nTERMINAL : chmod +x /location/of/your/file\n", "Q: Ubuntu 16.04 systemd user service anomaly I have enabled and started a user service (systemctl --user enable serviceName... etc.).\nBut when I log off, the service stops. Why?\nI have made a similar user service on Fedora 22 before, but that doesn't stop when I log off.\nIs there any workaround for this?\n\nA: It might be even better:\n\nThe systemd user instance is started after the first login of a user\n  and killed after the last session of the user is closed. Sometimes it\n  may be useful to start it right after boot, and keep the systemd user\n  instance running after the last session closes, for instance to have\n  some user process running without any open session. Lingering is used\n  to that effect. Use the following command to enable lingering for\n  specific user:\n# loginctl enable-linger username\n\n\nhttps://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Systemd/User\n\nA: Systemd user services only last as long as a user's session does. This means you must be logged in for a user service to operate successfully.\nIn Ubuntu, your session ends when you log out of X, and all terminals (TTYs, local, and remote). I would assume Fedora kept a user session open for you.\nFor Ubuntu, I would suggest that you create a system-level service and then tell it to run as a specific user. You can do this by setting User= and Group= in the [Service] section of your file. If you want to just have write access on that user account, I would suggest you set appropriate file permissions.\nFinally, if you want to make it so that a service starts only when a user tells it to, you can use the instructions from this AU post.\n", "Q: How to restore default Unity I was messing around with Compiz Settings Manager and result of that is that I cant see my panel bar, cant use alt+tab or start button. Is there a way to restore default Ubuntu environment? I will be grateful for your help\n\nA: Or you can install \"Unity Tweak Tool\" and set the default settings. Open a terminal and type:\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt install unity-tweak-tool\n\n\nA: In terminal, type in sudo apt-get install --reinstall ubuntu-desktop to completely reinstall back to defaults.\nTo remove all compiz settings type rm  -rf ~/.compiz-1 ~/.config/compiz-1 in terminal, then logout and back in.\n\nA: Try the following, open terminal and type:\nunity-reset\n\nAlternatively:\nsetsid unity\n\nBut, If you can't get to the terminal cause your start buttons doesn't work you can always (this only works if you have a folder on the desktop) open the folder then go to 'computer>usr>share>applications' look for terminal inside the folder and click to open, then enter either of the above commands in the terminal.\n", "Q: Irssi certificate, OpenPGP and SSH keys in a new install I'm intending to perform a full fresh install of Xenial 64 bits on my laptop currently running Trusty 32, bits since my CPU is 64 bits capable.\nI want/need to keep my current Irssi certificate, OpenPGP and SSH keys in the new install so my question regards how should I go about keeping them. Is it enough to backup /home/username/.bazaar/, /home/username/.irssi/ and /home/username/.ssh/ folders and just past these in the new install home partition and everything will work?\nAre there any other folders (regarding what I mention in my previous paragraph) I should backup?\n\nA: In short, yes.\nYou may need to re-register and/or re-import the private keys from these locations, but you can do that after installing the respective tools.\nHowever, you should make sure that you actually backed up the private keys and that they're valid. md5summing is good enough for this.\n", "Q: Adding Page Quotas to the network printers I want to set up a daily page quota , for all the printers connected to the network ( not for one local printer ). I know that there is a CUPS option to achieve this (-o job-page-limit=value), but I'm not sure how to implement it.\n\nA: When you set up a printer using the lpadmin command, you can specify the quota settings.\nParticularly, there are two values you should be interested in: \n\n\n*\n\n*job-page-limit\nThis lets you set the number of pages in the limit, for a specified time period.\n\n*job-quota-period\nThis lets you decide how long the page limit quota lasts.\n\n\nFor example, if you want to set users to be able to print a max of 20 pages per day from the printer myprinter, you would use the following command (as root):\nlpadmin -p myprinter -o job-quota-period=86400 -o job-page-limit=20\n\nYou must run this command once per printer on each computer that is directly connected to the printer in question.\nIf you wish to set a non-expiring limit, set job-quota-period to 0.\nSome caveats though:\n\n\n*\n\n*These quotas apply to everyone, and there is no way to change this. Root is just as affected by this quota as anyone else\n\n*Counting can be wonky. For example, a person at (quota - 1) current pages can easily send a job of any size and it will still print.\n\n*Jammed and aborted jobs still cont towards the quota\n\n*Error messages are confusing to end users, and give no information.\n\n\nSource 1 Source 2\n", "Q: Restoring Windows after installing Ubuntu My laptop's hard drive broke down recently, and I had to replace it. Before it broke, it was running Windows 8, and I was trying to set it up to dual boot with Ubuntu. But every time I ran the Ubuntu installer, it would crash while trying to install Grub. So I thought, since my new hard drive is empty anyway, maybe I should try installing Ubuntu first and then restore Windows 8 from my backup afterward, since I've heard that Ubuntu is easier to set up dual boot with than Windows. But I've never had to use Windows' backup tools before, so I'm not sure if that would work; I'm kinda scared that when Windows sees another OS on the hard drive, it'll either go bonkers or try to overwrite it. Does anyone know if it's possible to restore a backup after installing another OS like this?\nThe backup of Windows itself is a copy of the recovery partition that came with the laptop, and for the backup of my files I used the Windows 7 recovery tools. My laptop is an Asus UX302L.\nThanks\n\nA: Restoring Windows from one PC to another is ... a Windows problem, not Ubuntu problem. I guess it can be done. This site does not offer Windows support. Perhaps you should looks for such backup support on Windows sites.\nAs for dual-boot, i always find easier to first install/restore Windows and then install Ubuntu. Less trouble, less problems (Ubuntu recognize Win OS, but WinOS doesn't recognize Ubuntu, etc).\n", "Q: How to backup a folder once a day?

If you don't have this file set up, there are a lot of examples in the web, but if you have a nvidia driver it comes with a tool to generate one.  Just run\nsudo nvidia-xconfig \n\n2)EDIT THIS NEW FILE xorg.conf customizing the sections \"Screen\" and \"Monitor\" with the settings for the native resolution of your Display.  You should run \"sudo gedit\" in a terminal in order to be able to save the changes in /etc/X11 system folder.  It will be easier if you search the web for some examples and specific options for your monitor such as horizontal and vertical refresh rates.  I would suggest to run a search for \"1680x1050\" (or your native resolution) AND \"xorg.conf\".  Here's an example of the \"Monitor\" section for a Syncmaster 2043NWX:\nSection \"Monitor\"\n    Identifier     \"Monitor0\"\n    VendorName     \"Unknown\"\n    ModelName      \"Samsung SyncMaster\"\n    HorizSync       30.0 - 81.0\n    VertRefresh     56.0 - 75.0\n    Option         \"DPMS\"\nEndSection\n\n3)ADD A LINE TO OVERRIDE EDID, as your native configuration wasn't listed in the EDID data that your drivers retrieved from your Display, and you'll be forcing this resolution through xorg.conf.  It's the first line written in this answer.\n4)SAVE THE FILE AND LOG OUT.  Be sure to save xorg.conf in /etc/X11, and log out of your ubuntu session.  If everything was OK, after logout the native resolution should be set and working, even for the login screen, as /etc/X11/xorg.conf is readed by X-Window every time it starts or restarts.  If something went wrong, you can temporally rename /etc/X11/xorg.conf as /etc/X11/_xorg.conf and then you should be able to log in with the default resolution.

I succeeded, but the problem is that the iptables logging now goes into 3 log files, syslog, kern.log and iptables.log.\nIdeally, I want the iptables logging go only into one file, iptables.log.\n\nA: The problem was that rsyslog was loading the 50-default.conf preferences before the custom preferences set in my_iptables.conf.\nThe solution was to add a number prefix to the conf filename, one that was lower than 50. So I renamed it to 10-my_iptables.conf.\nFile /etc/rsyslog.d/10-my_iptables.conf\n# Log kernel generated iptables log messages to file\n:msg,contains,\"[ipT\" /var/log/iptables.log\n& ~\n\niptables logging prefix:\n... -j LOG --log-prefix \"[ipT4] ...\n\nip6tables logging prefix:\n... -j LOG --log-prefix \"[ipT6] ...\n\nThen I restarted rsyslog:\n# sudo service rsyslog restart\n\nThis had the desired effect -- all iptables logging was now directed to '/var/log/iptables.log'.\n", "Q: Dual-booting Windows 10 and Ubuntu 16.04 on different drives with UEFI I have a UEFI system and two drives: one with Windows 10 installed( and with a lot of stuff on it, so I'd rather not have to reinstall windows) and one on which I'd like to install Ubuntu. \nAt first I tried installing ubuntu on the other drive and unplug the windows drive when I used ubuntu ( I had only the drive I want to install Ubuntu on plugged, so I installed it using the \"erase everything and install Ubuntu\" option), but when I boot into ubuntu it overwrites the windows bootloader, and to boot into windows again I have to reset the bootloader with an installation drive, which is really annoying.\nSo I tried having both drives connected at the same time and dual booting through the windows bootloader( with a software called easyBCD on windows), but with this method it's ubuntu that doesn't boot.\nSo I wanted to know if there's a way to make windows boot through grub while having the two OSs' installed on different drives( I'm willing to reinstall Ubuntu, if necessary).\n\nA: Selectively unplugging one disk or another is a trick that some people used in the BIOS era, but EFI's design makes this approach less useful. This is particularly true for some computers, which may erase boot manager entries when they're found to no longer point to valid boot loaders, which of course will be true when you unplug a disk to which they point. Thus, I strongly recommend against using this procedure when using an EFI-based computer.\nThe last I heard, EasyBCD was useless, or nearly so, on EFI-based computers. (That said, I haven't looked into it recently, so it could have changed.) Note that EasyBCD is a third-party Windows tool for managing the Windows boot loader and boot manager, which is known as the BCD. The BCD itself can be used to chainload to a Linux boot loader; however, I know very little about how to configure it to do so.\nMost Linux users run GRUB 2 as their boot manager under EFI; however, other options are available, as outlined in this question and its answers. Ideally, the simplest procedure to get GRUB 2 working is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install Windows\n\n*Install Ubuntu\n\n\nThe Ubuntu installer should detect Windows and add it as a boot option to the GRUB menu. Juggling disks, skipping the GRUB installation in favor of something else, and other advanced trickery is most likely to cause new problems. That said, there are cases when you might want to take an alternative path, such as if you dislike GRUB and want to use something else. In such a case, though, you should research the issue before beginning.\nAlso, note that neither Windows nor Ubuntu should delete the other's boot loader. What both will do, however, is to place their own boot loader (BCD or GRUB) as the first one in the EFI's boot manager list. You can modify this ordering with EasyUEFI or bcdedit in Windows, with efibootmgr in Ubuntu, or with some (but not all) computers' built-in firmware configuration utilities. If you don't understand how all these pieces (the firmware's boot manager, BCD, GRUB, and perhaps other tools) fit together, you're likely to become confused. To that end, here's some suggested reading:\n\n\n*\n\n*Adam Williamson's blog entry on how EFI works -- This page describes the theory behind EFI-mode booting.\n\n*My page on installing Linux on EFI systems -- This page is a more practical introduction to EFI-mode booting than Adam Williamson's blog.\n\n*My page on EFI boot loaders for Linux -- This page describes EFI boot loader choices for Linux systems.\n\n*The Ubuntu community wiki entry on UEFI -- This page is a bit disjointed, but is the most Ubuntu-specific introduction to EFI and its issues.\n\n\nFor specific advice on how to proceed, if you can boot Ubuntu right now, try doing so (with the Windows drive also connected) and then type sudo update-grub at the command line. That will re-run the GRUB configuration scripts, which should cause it to detect Windows and add it to the GRUB menu. If that doesn't work, then you need to be more specific about what's not working -- for instance, is Windows not appearing in the GRUB menu, is it appearing but failing, and if it's failing, what error messages (if any) do you see?\n\nA: I just dual booted Windows 10 and Ubuntu 16.04 using the hard drive juggle and it was very easy.  Make sure UEFI is enabled in your BIOS (my Gigabyte board called it \"Windows 8\" mode).  Assuming two drives, A and B:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install Windows 10 on drive A\n\n*Unplug drive A\n\n*Install Ubuntu on drive B\n\n*Plug drive A back in\n\n*Boot up (boots into Ubuntu with no sign of Windows)\n\n*sudo apt-get install grub2 (Windows will be detected and added to grub menu)\n\n\nEasy peasy, no fanciness, articles, or theory required.

After going from 12.04 to 14.04 via do-release-upgrade, I find that I have version 0.4.7 of Xournal where I previously had version 0.4.8.  The latter is provided by a ppa (viz. the ubiquitous webupd8), which was disabled automatically by do-release-upgrade.  The version in the official repositories for both Precise and Trusty is 0.4.7.  Nevertheless I would not have expected the installed package to be downgraded, and can find no documentation of such a behavior.  (It is particularly annoying, because I need to manually patch and recompile this software every time it is updated due to an apparent bug in the driver for the Fujitsu p1630's touchscreen---which, incidentally, I would like to report if I could figure out where to do it.)\nCan anyone confirm or disconfirm that this is the expected behavior?\nEdited to add the output of apt-cache rdepends --installed Xournal:\narchelon@ingelrayok:~$ apt-cache rdepends --installed Xournal\nxournal\nReverse Depends:\narchelon@ingelrayok:~$\n\n\nA: I'd say you're mistaken about the versions of Xournal on 12.04 and 14.04.

The webupd8 PPA uses the older version scheme, 0.4.8. Of course 4.7 won out over 0.4.8.\n", "Q: Installing Linux on Hardware Raid 0 I have an msi gs70 stealth pro, with two ssd's configured in hardware raid 0 as well as a hdd. I've always installed linux (dual boot with windows) on the hdd, to avoid raid complications, but after learning more about hardware vs software raid, I'm wondering if this makes a difference? Has anyone had any experience or knowledge about installing linux on hardware raid 0? Does it change the way I need to partition the drive? In the installer, when I go to manually configure partitions, all the entries on the raid drive are doubled. Do I need to mimic what I do for each entry? Also is there any chance the the raid 0 controller might not communicate with linux correctly?\n\nA: It seems after messing with it for a while, that the hardware made doesn't affect things much in terms of partitioning. If you create a new partition in windows at least, unlike the default system partitions, it won't show up doubled in the linux installer. Now, depending on the distribution you use, it seems like need certain packages in order for linux to correctly use the raid partition. These are generally installed automatically and you never have to worry about them, but some distributions, KDE Neon in my case, try to automatically remove them. \n", "Q: VirtualBox Ubuntu guest from real partition image boots into emergency mode, can't get to login screen I've got a dual boot system on my disk:\n\n\n*\n\n*Windows 10 64-bit: main OS\n\n*Ubuntu 64-bit: secondary OS\n\n\nI installed VirtualBox; I'm trying to use my real Linux partition as a Virtual Machine using Windows as the host.

I constantly think about encryption, and how safe it might be. The general information I have tends to be secured by passwords that range in the hundreds with random key combinations in between random words and such.

I imagine getting a key-file on a small partitioned USB and putting it in a live rasberry pi to carry around and have a push button to activate a crypto-graphically secure wipe/overwrite of the key file if I feel its in danger of being taken. How safe would you say Luks is against such an attack? 8192kB is the Max Keyfile size, I dont like this.\nI use dd if=/dev/urandom of=/key bs=8192KB count=1 to generate keyfiles.

I'm a tor/tails user, a Faraday cage enthusiast and a blanket wielding password typer. Thank you for your thoughts.\n\nA: You may want to investigate how some common encryption schemes like AES work, keys are actually 16 to 64 bytes (maybe 256 or 512?). Having a 10 billion byte passphrase won't really add anything except confusion for you.\nAlso consider that if a government is investigating you, they could search every device & drive you have anywhere (house, car, work, buried in yard, swallowed, etc), a keyfile would probably help them a lot.\nI haven't read anything about Luks being less secure than pgp/gpg, and it has thwarted a few government investigations.\nI believe several governments and large corporations use & trust  Linux and LUKS, so if it's good enough for them...\n\nA: alternative to old truecrypt is Veracrypt. Supposedly continuing where truecrypt left off. As Veracrypt can encrypt folders, you can have a LUKS volume with a Veracryt container with your photos of the president's wife naked, and they probably won't get to them.

As explained in the -atime section of man find (-mtime works in the same way):\n   -atime n\n          File  was  last  accessed n*24 hours ago.  When find figures out\n          how many 24-hour periods ago the file  was  last  accessed,  any\n          fractional part is ignored, so to match -atime +1, a file has to\n          have been accessed at least two days ago.\n\nSo, to find a file that was modified 7 or more days ago, you need to find files that were modified more than 6 days ago, hence -mtime +6.\nThe next step is to have this command run once a day. Since each securityuserN is a different user (you might want to rethink that setup, it makes everything more complicated), this must be run as root.

The reason for that is because Unity locks windows in place when they are maximized, making them not respond to whatever command xdotool issues.\nNote: This script will be updated and refined over time. I will likely add it to my personal github repository but as of right now it exists as a gist\nSetting Shortcut\nGo to System Settings  -> Keyboard -> Shortcuts -> Custom and click on the + button in the lower left corner to create new entry.

It will scan for updates for all your repositories and PPA's you added. It will scan based on a period set in \"settings\":\n\nIf you do not care about what gets updated this one is good enough. And you can set this to silently update.\nUbuntu Software has its own version on this. Basically it uses the same method but another way of displaying the updates. It shows them per installed software with a fancy icon and description making it easier to check and to install single updates. I assume updating through this is always manual(?) and assume this might only install updates for the software it lists(?) (going to use the next few updates for testing these claims).\n\nWhen you use 1 of them the other will show less and less. Oh, and you can not use them at the same time (the update locks the process for itself until done).\nOne thing I noticed: the software updater tells you there needs to be a reboot. The one from SC seems to not do that (just did an update through SCU and SU told me I needed to reboot).\n\n*You pick one of them and then other will not show new software anymore. The 1st one will pop up and notify you so might be easier to use.\n\n*Device drivers might be an optional extra update. Depending on usage though: if your current one works stick with it (don't try to fix things that work for you).\n", "Q: Switch between Intel & nVidia cards ubuntu 16.04 I just bought a new laptop with both an Intel HD 5500 and nVidia GeForce 920M, and I'm running Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.

For some reason, the sharing of internet via cable on Ubuntu does not provide speed or stability. \nI also tried the Lan drivers from the manofacturer with no sucess. I don’t know if I am missing something.\n\nA: I've done something similar to establish an Ethernet connection for a Raspberry Pi (and an Xbox 360, which is more similar to your situation, I suppose).\nI've got a script on Github here which will do the job: https://github.com/le1ca/rpi-router/blob/master/rpi-router.sh\nThere are a few things you need to know in advance for this script to work:\n\n\n*\n\n*The name of your ethernet interface (obtain this using ifconfig).\n\n*The name of your WiFi interface (same deal).\n\n*A static subnet for your ethernet network (this is something you can set up using the instructions on the answer you already linked to).\n\n\nMy script sets up NAT (which is kind of like what your WiFi router does to \"hide\" your local network from the public Internet) so it will behave slightly differently from a true bridged connection. Sometimes this is necessary, if you are on a very picky WiFi network for example.\nTo get everything working, just do the initial setup for the static IPs, set the configuration in the first few lines of the script, then run it like sudo rpi-router.sh.\n", "Q: Based on certain patterns exclude lines in file My file looks like this \n[0.00137532,[0,13,19,16,18,15,19,16,11,15,12,12,13,14,0,11,17,18,14,17],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0189924,0.0871235,0.179813,0.307779,0$\nSITE:   0        0.000853196055    0.0694597696 0000000001\n[0.00111747753,[0,13,18,16,19,15,18,19,11,15,12,12,13,14,0,11,17,14,16,17],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.018992411,0.0871235198,0.179812517$\n[0.000200093646,[0,13,19,17,18,16,19,15,11,16,12,12,13,14,15,0,11,18,14,17],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.018992411,0.0871235198,0.17981251$\n[1.9658373e-05,[0,18,14,11,12,19,14,15,16,19,17,12,13,0,11,13,17,18,15,16],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.106437198,0.163778333,0.758483056,$\n[0.000282736441,[0,18,15,11,13,19,15,12,16,19,17,12,13,14,0,11,17,18,14,16],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.106437198,0.129806881,0.163778333$\n[0.00111187732,[0,13,19,16,18,15,19,17,11,15,12,12,13,14,0,11,17,18,14,16],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.018992411,0.0871235198,0.179812517$\nSITE:   1         0.00363901565     0.820587534 1000100111\n[0.000647295926,[0,13,19,16,18,15,19,17,11,15,12,12,13,14,0,11,17,18,14,16],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.018992411,0.0871235198,0.17981251$\n[0.000272141,[0,11,19,16,18,15,19,17,13,15,14,12,0,14,11,13,17,18,12,16],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.687401201,0.989300937,0.018992411,0.$\n[1.82208814e-05,[0,11,16,13,15,19,16,14,17,19,18,12,0,14,15,11,13,18,12,17],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.569817481,0.687401201,0.106437198$\n[0.000160613913,[0,11,19,16,18,15,19,17,13,15,14,12,0,14,11,13,17,18,12,16],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.687401201,1.05012976,0.018992411,$\nSITE:   2         0.00509457547    0.0291019941 1000000000\n\nhow can I get a new file in which the lines starting with SITE are excluded (the white space does not have to be there)\n\nA: Many many ways:\n\n\n*\n\n*grep:\ngrep -v '^SITE' input.txt >output.txt\n\n^SITE matches SITE at the start, -v inverts the match.

If not, how can I generate one? Is there a Ubuntu distribution that comes with TeamViewer (or similar VNC based service) that is as foolproof as possible?\n\nA: There is no LiveUSB/LiveCD or distribution of Ubuntu that comes with TeamViewer builtin.  TeamViewer is third-party closed source software that is packaged by their development teams for Ubuntu - it is not included in the repositories.\nIt is possible under every Ubuntu distribution to set up x11vnc or similar, however, to do VNC functionality that you can access with a VNC viewer.  You may refer to \"How do I install a VNC server?\" for further guidance on setting up x11vnc or other solutions on an Ubuntu system.  (There are not, however, LiveUSBs/LiveCDs of Ubuntu which ship with this - you would have to install them after the fact)\n\nA: You can create a live ubuntu (kubuntu/lubuntu/xubuntu/neon)..... usb with persistence file and install teamviewer (and other desired software) on it. howto :)\nIf needed you can store a binary image of that disk and create a usb when needed.\n", "Q: In Gnome 16.04 Window minimize shortcut is not working I used to use window + H to minimize a window.

On Ubuntu 16.04, you have to use Ctrl+Alt+0 by default, but it didn't work for me either. Maybe it has to do with the fact that I don't have NumPad panel on a laptop.\nAnyway, just re-assign it in the Keyboard settings.\n", "Q: sddm xsetup location I've been using vino (remote desktop access application) in 12.04 without any problem.

If the file already exists, shlock will read the  process ID  from  the file and test to see if the process is currently running. If the process exists, then the file will not be created.

Unfortunately there are currently all kinds of different dialects installed for both English and German, making it rather cumbersome to select the one dialect I want to use. I just need English US and German DE.\nQuestion: How can I uninstall all those additional dialects like German (LU), or English (CA)?\n\nCurrently I have only installed the following three language packs in Ubuntu:\n\nAdditionally my package manager shows me I have installed the following locale package for Ubunut:\nthunderbird-locale-de       \nthunderbird-locale-en       \nthunderbird-locale-en-gb    \nthunderbird-locale-en-us    \nthunderbird-locale-zh-cn    \nthunderbird-locale-zh-hans  \n\nI am using Ubuntu 16.04 with Thunderbird 38.8.0\n\nA: I was able to resolve this by uninstalling the respective hunspell packages:\nFirst I searched for all installed hunspell packages:\naptitude search hunspell|grep ^i\n\nWhich returned this list:\ni   hunspell-de-at   \ni   hunspell-de-ch   \niB  hunspell-de-de   \ni A hunspell-en-ca   \ni A hunspell-en-gb   \ni   hunspell-en-us   \ni A hunspell-en-za   \ni A libhunspell-1.3-0\n\nThen I removed the unnecessary ones with:\nsudo apt purge hunspell-de-at hunspell-de-ch hunspell-en-ca \\\nhunspell-en-gb hunspell-en-za\n\nNote: A few redundancies still remain, which are caused by the fact that some packages install symlinks to other languages which then show up as duplicates in thunderbird. For example hunspell-de-de installs a symlink name de_BE.aff in /usr/share/hunspell which points to de_DE.aff. See https://launchpad.net/bugs/651586 (Thanks to Gunnar Hjalmarsson for pointing this out in the comments).\n\nA: You can find the installed dictionaries at /usr/lib/thunderbird/dictionaries\nand delete the unwanted .aff and .dic dictionaries there.\nThings change depending on Thunderbird and Ubuntu version so it's worth noting for future readers that I am on Ubuntu 14.04 and Thunderbird 38.8.0.\n", "Q: Ubuntu Server 16.04 and Active Directory I've been following the “SSSD and Active Directory” documentation in order to try and add an Ubuntu Server to our Windows AD domain for user authentication.\nConfiguration goes well until the point at which I need to start the SSSD service.\nThe service will not start, it after checking journalctl the following error is given:\n\nFailed to read keytab [default]: No such file or directory\n\nI would guess this is being caused by:\nkerberos method = secrets and keytab\n\ninside /etc/samba/smb.conf but no information is given in the documentation about other possible values this method can be set to.\n\nA: I found a solution: when you restart the services in the how-to guide you can’t start the SSSD daemon cause the error.

More specifically, the most recent update of Chrome (google-chrome-stable), had a large number of security fixes. A prior update had an overhaul of the appearance (which I would consider a new feature).\n", "Q: Start terminal in ubuntu with a python script? How can I start a terminal in Ubuntu 16.04 with a python script, execute commands on that terminal, and retrieve the output from those commands?\nFor example, I want to check the contents of a folder (through CLI) and return the results to the python script. So, I want my python code to do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open terminal\n\n*cd <path/to/folder>\n\n*ls\n\n*//Retrieve the output and process this information.\n\n\nIs it possible to run CLI commands and listen to the results (because, the next command is based on the output of the previous command) without opening a terminal?\n\nA: If you really need a terminal, you're probably going to have to drum up a pty and connect stdin and stdout to it, then use the Subprocess module to run your application.  Even that won't filter out any curses escape sequences or ASCII graphics (why else would you need a terminal?) but if the app is checking for the presence of a terminal, it would work.\nIf all you need to do is run a command-line application and redirect its input and output, just use the Subprocess module directly.\n\nA: You can do this using the os module:\n#!/usr/bin/env python\n\nimport os\noutput = os.listdir('path_to_folder')  # output is a list\n# Do whatever you want to output\n\nYou can read more about what else the os module can do at https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html.

The device will sync, unmount if not busy, and then power down, i.e., the power/status light will turn off.  To remount or reuse a powered down USB device, you need to unplug it and plug it back in.  A partition can simply be re-accessed.\n", "Q: How to use available RAM? My computer running Ubuntu 16.04 has 32GB RAM, but even on heavy tasks, rarely over 8GB is consumed.\nI wonder if is possible to tell Ubuntu to use more RAM to speed up the process.\nMoreover, after a day of working, my computer is slowing down, and needs a reboot. Is it normal? Can't Ubuntu fresh itself up when resources are abundant?\n\nA: \nTell Ubuntu to use more RAM to speed up the process\n\nUbuntu does not control what the applications you're using do with available memory, the applications themselves do. So you'd need to find some way to tell the application you're using that it shold use more memory. However, most applications only use as much memory as they actually need - using more isn't going to improve performance. (What applications are you using, though ?)\n\nHowever, what Ubuntu does do is use unused, available RAM as cache, i.e. recently accessed files are kept in memory, so that when they are needed again, they do not need to be fetched from disk. This improves performance. This is also why starting an application (e.g web browser or IDE) a second time is faster that starting it \"cold\", i.e. immediately after boot.\n\nAfter a day of working, my computer is slowing down [...]\n\nNo, this isn't normal. I generally have weeks of uptime on my Linux systems, and performance isn't affected. Maybe check the memory / CPU usage at the end of the day, and see if something is using lots of resources. What do you mean by \"is slowing down\", though ?\n", "Q: Find details of click and keyboard events I have noticed that there isn't much of an alternative to Problem Steps Recorder for linux, and I am going to try to make one in a shell script.\n\n\n*\n\n*How can I wait until/detect when the mouse is cliked? I would like to take a screenshot at this time.\n\n*How can I find a description of any button or input field the mouse has clicked? Problem Steps Recorder would return something like User left-click on \"close window\" if I clicked the 'X' or User left-click on \"close\" if I clicked the \"close\" button.\n\n*How can I wait until/detect when a key is pressed and find out which key?\n\n\nA: You could use the xinput --test-xi2 --root command (man xinput), where test-xi2 means logging input devices, and --root is to log from so called root window (a x11 specific concept). It would show you when and which key pressed in the system, mouse clicks, and even mouse motion coordinates. It solves your 1 and 3 points, you just need to parse these events.\nThe 2 point is trickier. You can use xev -root command which would monitor all X events in the system, including things like (dis) appearing windows, entering/exiting focus of a particular window, etc. You have to parse its output, and show a human-readable description of what is happening. Btw, the command logs pressed keys also.\nA caveat: it is, obviously, a great security hole, which dates back to times when Xorg was created, and nobody needed to care. For this reason nowadays X11 is being replaced with the Wayland protocol (it is in the essence a X12, but as not backward compatible, the protocol land called another way), which WMs are implementing ATM. It isn't quick process as the protocol demands much more from WM, but Fedora 25 seem to finally have Wayland session enabled by default. KWin is also catching up. And your script not going to work on Wayland. This doesn't mean you can't do it — I think, you can. But you'd need to work closely with a particular WM of a particular DE, and the script would be not a stand alone bash script, but rather an addon to a WM.\n", "Q: can any one put command to install kazam screen recorder with webcam can any one have command to install Kazam screen recorder with web cam?\ni have command to install Kazam but it only facilitate screen recorder not give web cam facility at a same time.\n\nA: Kazam Screencaster will already detect your Webcam, make sure your Webcam drivers are installed correctly and they're allowed by the 3rd party applications.\nIf you already have done that and your webcam isn't yet supported by Kazam Screencaster.\nTry the following for Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (your operating system as I understood from the comments):\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:kazam-team/unstable-series\n\nNOTICE: If you get \"sudo: add-apt-repository: command not found\" - you can easily install it using \"apt-get\" by typing:\napt-get -y install software-properties-common python-software-properties\n\nNow update your sources.list by typing:\napt-get -y update\n\nNow install Kazam and it's required packages:\napt-get -y install kazam python3-cairo python3-xlib\n\n", "Q: Why is Ubuntu capturing space after uninstallation?

Something went really wrong because after that I see that the 15 GB space, which was allocated to Ubuntu, is not freed yet. If I reboot the machine and select 'Ubuntu' then it does not reboot and shows an error that 'some files are not found' (pretty obvious).

WPA2-AES is preferred; not any WPA and WPA2 mixed mode and certainly, absolutely not TKIP. Second, if your router is capable of N speeds, you may have better connectivity with a channel width of 20 MHz in the 2.4 GHz band instead of automatic 20/40 MHz, although it is likely to affect N speeds. I also have better luck with a fixed channel, either 1, 6 or 11, rather than automatic channel selection. Also, be certain the router is not set to use N speeds only; auto B, G and N is preferred. After making these changes, reboot the router. \nNext, I recommend that your regulatory domain be set explicitly.

However, on Haswell, Broadwell and Skylake processors, they can also be caused by outdated firmware to work around processor errata/defects.  The Xeon E5-v3 processor does have several MCE-generating errata, and therefore it will require a reasonably up-to-date firmware to get a microcode capable of supporting Linux.\nThe procedures to deal with possible hardware defects are well known, and you will find lots of information and guides in the network if you search for them.  I will answer from the microcode/firmware angle, which is a lot less well known.\nAssuming you are not doing anything as idiotic as insisting on trying to overclock/undervolt/underclock a system that is reporting MCE errors (i.e. ensure every overclock feature of the mainboard is inactive):\n\n\n*\n\n*Install the latest firmware (BIOS/UEFI) update from the system vendor, or chances are you will not even manage to install a Linux distro because it will crash before the end of the install (or corrupt the installed image).\n\n\nIf you installed that Xeon on a desktop board (which appears to be the case, since EVGA is not known to make server/workstation-class hardware), well, you may have to pester the motherboard vendor for a new BIOS version with the latest microcode and memory controller firmware from Intel, or hack that BIOS yourself to update its built-in microcode with the latest available from Intel -- search for BIOS modding forums for help, but do try talking to EVGA first, an official BIOS is much better.\n\n\n*Install the intel-microcode package/\"CPU microcode driver\" when prompted for that, as long as the firmware has new enough microcode to actually manage to finish installing Ubuntu and boot the system without crashing, the intel-microcode package can be used to fix most remaining microcode issues.\n\n", "Q: Unable to install or remove MySQL So today I installed MariaDB so I can login through phpmyadmin, apparently it didn't work so I removed it, tried again like four times and I failed.

I am completely new to Linux.\n\nA: You can also use GParted for this; it will give you a nice graphical display of all partitions; you can also modify / delete / create partitions using it, if you want.\n\nYou can install it using the Software Center, or by typing sudo apt-get install gparted.\n\nA: In Windows , the equivalent of GParted is the Disk Management app. Just remember that Win doesn't recognize any linux partition. It will graphically show that space as unknown format. Make sure you don't (re)format that space, as it may belong to Ubuntu. You can read Ubuntu partitions from Win by using DiskInternals Linux Reader app. You can (only) read, but not write or modify linux partitions in any way from inside the Linux Reader.  \nUbuntu has the upper hand, it can do read, write and modify both Win and linux partitions.\n", "Q: LibreOffice Calc: two documents with same font and size with different results I created two documents (meant to be front and back of a brochure) with LibreOffice Calc. I used the same font and size (Droid Sans size 10) for both and they came out of the printer in very different size. \nWhat I tried: to make sure the right size was used, I marked the full text, changed the size (it visibly changed on screen) then changed it back to size 10 (again I could watch the change on screen). I did the same with the second text and saved both. They still came out very different.\nI checked the printer setting but couldn't find any 'resize'-mode.\nAny ideas, please? Thank you.\n\nA: User tohuwawahu made a comment suggesting that OP check \nMenu Format > Page > Sheet Tab > Scaling mode\nThey also linked to this answer on Super User which explains what the Scaling Mode setting does.\nThe OP replied that this suggestion fixed their problem: scaling had been set to 85% for one of their pages. \n", "Q: apt-get generally fails, with software packages and with update I am running a VM of Ubuntu server 14.04.4 using virtual box.

I want to be able to work with Ruby and rails apps.\nUsually I use rvm  for this. \nIs it possible to install rvm [or something similiar] using ubuntu-touch and the libertine containers?\nSo far I have had lots of trouble installing rails via rvm. The typical command is \n\\curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --rails\nI have tried lots of variations of installing it with libertine-container-manager but none have been successful. \nIf I enter the container I get the following error:\nroot@ubuntu-phablet:/# \\curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --rails\nDownloading https://github.com/rvm/rvm/archive/1.27.0.tar.gz\nDownloading https://github.com/rvm/rvm/releases/download/1.27.0/1.27.0.tar.gz.asc\ngpg: fatal: can't create directory/home/phablet/.gnupg': No such file or directory`\nWhat does work is to add a new user within the container and then issue the normal commands. Within the container this will allow me to install ruby and rails with rvm but I can't access any rvm commands from outside the container. \nIs there a possible solution to this?\nNote I guess this question might be generalised to more than just rvm, it could be about installing software with git, or issuing commands which pipe text into bash ...\n\nA: I don't get the error you're getting.  I see rvm download a slew of arbitrary shell script commands from site on the internet which it then tries to run as the superuser using sudo.  My imagination is sparkled by so many possible ways to own someone's system right now.\nAnyway, to test this is had a container with a terminal installed (in my case, I used sakura).  Using a terminal app lets you run as the phablet user, no need to add another user.  I used the libertine-container-manager CLI tools to install the curl command but the sudo command isn't available, because that would let you break containment, so the installation failed.\nYou're not going to be able to run contained applications from outside the container because that would break confinement.  \n", "Q: Gnome, Lock Screen Slide show I want to Create a slideshow lockscreen using the GNOME desktop. I am running Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.\nI am particularly talking about the \"lockscreen\" not the Login screen, and definitely not the wallpaper...\nIt should basically be like Windows spotlight. \nAny help will be highly appreciated,\n\nA: This is what I've come up with so far. I'm not a very experienced bash programmer, so I'm sure there are improvements that could be made both for readability and efficiency, but this is what I got to work after hours of finagling.\n#!/bin/bash\n\nxset s off    # This turns off the \"screensaver\" feature (not actually a screensaver, just an annoying power saving feature.)\nxset -dpms    # Turns off dpms (desktop power management system -- also annoying)\n\nwhile true; do\n    gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.screensaver picture-uri /WALLPAPERS/\"$(ls /WALLPAPERS/ | sort -R | tail -n 1)\"\n    sleep 30    # This is the amount of time in seconds to wait before changing\ndone\n\nWhere \"WALLPAPERS\" is the full path to the parent directory of whatever image(s) you want to set on the lock screen.\nSave this script with whatever name you want e.g. lockscreen-slideshow.sh -- just make sure you know where it's being saved to. You'll also need to make it executable, which you can do in a terminal with chmod +x lockscreen-slideshow.sh\nLastly, you'll want to add a startup script so you don't have to open a terminal and run your script manually every time you log in, so make a new file in ~/.config/autostart/ e.g. \"lockscreen-slideshow.desktop\" and drop this copy pasta into that bowl, then modify it to reflect the right path.\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=lockscreen-slideshow\nExec=/PATH_TO_SCRIPT/lockscreen-slideshow.sh\nComment=fetch a random anime wallpaper and plaster it to the lock screen\nHidden=false\nType=Application\n\nSomething to note: this is a slideshow in a very loose sense. It'll just swap the images out instantaneously. I haven't figured out how to make them transition smoothly yet, but I'm playing with adding new keys to gsettings schema (and then subsequently copying the key from org.gnome.nautilus.desktop called background-fade over to org.gnome.desktop.screensaver).\nHope this helps for now.\n", "Q: wrmsr not working since upgrade to Ubuntu 16.04 Since upgrading to Ubuntu 16.04, I have not been able to get wrmsr working on any address:\n$ sudo rdmsr 0x1a4\n0\n$ sudo wrmsr 0x1a4 0\nwrmsr: pwrite: Operation not permitted\n\nThere was a similar question in this site but the accepted answer provides a workaround only for Turbo Boost:\nCan't disable turbo boost since Ubuntu 16.04\nAny Ideas?

The key line is \"Using a compile server.\".  Why is it using such a server?  Because your account does not have the privileges required to build & run an arbitrary systemtap script.  Systemtap is hoping that by using a compile server that has been authorized by your local sysadmin, your unprivileged user may be able to run the script.  Then that effort fails because none of the servers it found are so authorized.\nSo, what to do?  The easiest thing to do is to run systemtap as root: sudo stap .....  The second easiest thing to do is to get your userid put into the stapdev and stapusr UNIX groups, which is roughly root-equivalent in power.  In both these cases, you can locally build & run arbitrary stap scripts.  The third easiest thing to do is to set up the remote compilation & limited privilege stuff; for that see man stap-server.\n", "Q: Can I install the latest version of Ubuntu Processor: Intel(R) Pentium(R) M processor 1.70GHz 1.70GHz\n32 bit operating system \n36.3 free of 55.7 GB \nWindows 7 HP Home Edition\nHP pavallon dv1000.

Home folder encryption (2) is kinda invisible, i.e. you get asked not for the encryption password but simply for the login and password to the system, those also do the decryption for you. When you follow steps from the guide you linked you just disable the home folder encryption, you are still going to be asked for the login and password to the system (this you can now disable in GUI in Settings > Users and Groups) AND if you also enabled the full disk encryption (1) when installing the system, for the password to decrypt the whole disk. I am not sure if it is possible to also disable full disk encryption (1).\n", "Q: \"Unable to access address of buffer\" MInecraft 1.10 I am attempting to run Minecraft 1.10 on Ubuntu 16.04.

Once installed, it can be started by simply executing buckle and stopped by Ctrl+C.\nIf you're on an older Ubuntu, you can try to install bucklespring from this PPA: https://launchpad.net/~mirabilos/+archive/ubuntu/ppa .\nIf the default sound recordings of IBM Model M are not suitable, you can replace them with your own. You can have a different sound for each key, but assuming you have only one sound, you need to make a few links to it, so that bucklespring will use it correctly.

In /bin most binaries don't have a sticky bit set except for: fusermout, mount, umount, ping, ping6 and su.\nWhy are these ones not supposed to be deleted or renamed? Is it because they are used in certain critical scripts and if so, does that mean all other binaries aren't vital and the system could work without them? \n\nA: That's not the sticky bit, that's the setuid bit. A sticky bit usually applies to directories, you can see that in /tmp for example:\n$ stat -c '%A %n' /tmp /bin/ping /usr/bin/crontab \ndrwxrwxrwt /tmp\n-rwsr-xr-x /bin/ping\n-rwxr-sr-x /usr/bin/crontab\n\nThe t indicates a sticky bit, an s in user modes indicate setuid and an s in group modes indicate setgid.\nThe setuid bit makes the command be run as the user who owns the file, usually root. This is done because:\n\n\n*\n\n*ping and ping6 need root access to use raw sockets. See this Super User post and this Unix & Linux post. As the SU answer notes, some distros now use capabilities instead of setuid — my Arch Linux system doesn't have setuid on ping.\n\n*su needs root access to switch to an arbitrary user\n\n*mount (and umount, etc.) need setuid to mount things that are specified as being mountable by anybody (via users option in /etc/fstab) (see this Unix & Linux answer)\n\n*crontab is setgid, since the crontab files are stored in a location only writable by root and the crontab group:\n$ stat -c '%A' /var/spool/cron/crontabs\ndrwx-wx--T\n\n(note: the crontab directory is also sticky.)\nAlso see:\n\n\n*\n\n*What is the first number for in a 4-number chmod argument (such as `chmod 4555`)?\n", "Q: gksudo pcmanfm alone or with gksudo leafpad?

In previous ubuntu versions, adding BOOT_DEGRADED=true to /etc/initramfs-tools/conf.d/mdadm allowed the system to automatically boot when the root filesystem is on a degraded array.

I have a SSD too, and I have done something similar, and it didn't wreck my disk.\nDisclaimer: If this breaks your disk, please tell me, but I am just saying what I think.\n\nA: I find the page you linked to is safe. It simply uses dd to read the whole disk, and then use cp to make a copy of the disk image to handle sparse file so that the result disk image is small. So the operation is mainly just read from the disk, and so it won't hurt your SSD. I think what you read about unsafe for SSD is something around the trim operation?

For note, a temporary workaround was to run sudo aptd in another terminal before running update-manager, and then update-manager was able to connect to aptd over dbus.\nUnfortunately, I can't determine which package was the precise fix now that my issue is solved but if you try reinstalling each one-by-one, you can report back.  A number of packages are/were broken on my system by a failed install resulting in odd issues like this one because of missing files, permissions and scripts; reinstalling packages is fixing these problems. \n\nA: I had a similar problem as in the question, I could not run the update-manager in my Xubuntu 16.04., and got similar error messages, because I had changed the soft link python3 from python3.5 to python3.8.\nAt the moment, update-manager and their child processes/packages run only in python3.5.\nSo I edited the code of following files and changed the shbang at the top of the file from #!/usr/bin/python3 to #!/usr/bin/python3.5\n\n*\n\n*/usr/sbin/aptd\n\n*/usr/bin/add-apt-repository\n\n*/usr/bin/update-manager\nAnd I could ran update-manager, but without settings.\nCaveat: it is not a very clean method to edit the /usr/bin installed files, but I rather do this quick fix and use the last version of python3.8 in my system. :)\n", "Q: how to start update process in ubuntu 16.04?

At any rate, I think this question is different enough.  At least I hope so.]\nThe Widget theme I selected in Lubuntu is Industrial. My understanding is the widget theme dictates what the scrollbar looks like in various programs.\nHere's what the scrollbars are supposed to look like under the Industrial theme.\n\n[Annotation should read Scrollbar not Toolbar ;) ]\nAs you can see, the scrollbars are wide, have a decorated thumb and arrows at both ends.\nBelow is an image that shows Pcmanfm (on the left) reflecting the Industrial type of scrollbar. Firefox 47.0, on the right, does not. It has a scrollbar that is too narrow for my comfortable use and it doesn't have the arrows at the top and bottom.\n\nI've read that Canonical has branded Firefox, so I thought maybe that was the issue.  I went into Firefox about:config and deleted everything I could that said Canonical. Still, I get the narrow scrollbars.\nSo what I'm trying to do is get the Firefox scrollbars to reflect the Widget theme I selected.\nBefore anyone asks, yes I've tried the Firefox addon called New Scrollbars (aka NoiaScrollbars). I can widen the scrollbars that way, but I can't add arrows top and bottom and I can't get a decorated thumb. IOW, it just looks too ugly for my tastes.\n\nA: Firefox 47 uses gtk3. PCManFM, the default version supplied with Lubuntu, uses gtk2. The industrial theme covers only gtk2. See /usr/share/themes/Industrial. There's no gtk-3.0 folder in there.\nIf you want Firefox to be themed decently, find a gtk3 theme!\nYou can increase the width of the scrollbar area (in some themes) by playing with the theme's gtk-widgets.css. Look for something like: -GtkRange-slider-width: and change the value to something you like.\nThat same file may also have something like:\n-GtkScrollbar-has-backward-stepper: false;\n-GtkScrollbar-has-forward-stepper: false;\n\nYou can try changing those values to true (if the theme supports steppers (the up and down arrows at the top and bottom of the scrollbar)). Many themes seem to be dropping them.\nAfter saving the file, close and restart Firefox.\n(I don't use Firefox themes or extensions for scrollbars and so can't help there. Same with decorating the thumb. Sorry!)\nAnd what you're seeing has nothing to do with Canonical's modifications, AFAIK.\n+++++++++++++\nTo know whether an application uses gtk2 or gtk3, try:\nldd /usr/bin/app_name | grep gtk\n\nThis, of course, assumes that the executable is in /usr/bin. If you're not sure, first ascertain that with which app_name.\n\n\n*\n\n*gtk2 apps will have libgtk-x11-2.0 in the response.\n\n*gtk3 apps will have libgtk-3 in the response.\n\n", "Q: Can't use SSH at all I'm having some problems when trying to use the command ssh-copy-id in my server, unfortunately I get the following response: \nssh: connect to host 192.168.10.10 port 22: Connection refused\n\nI can't find out what is happening, even though I tried many solutions.

If you don’t do\n  this, the installer will complain (with a somewhat confusing error\n  message) and refuse to let you start the installation.\nSo if you’re doing a UEFI native install and using custom\n  partitioning, you need to ensure that a partition of the ‘EFI system\n  partition’ type is mounted at /boot/efi – this is where Fedora expects\n  to find the EFI system partition it’s using. If there is an existing\n  EFI system partition on the system, just set its mount point to\n  /boot/efi. If there is not an EFI system partition yet, create a\n  partition, set its type to EFI system partition, make it at least\n  200MB big (500MB is good), and set its mount point to /boot/efi\n\n\nA: By luck I solved my problem. \nI booted with the live usb and called Disks, and manually deleted all partions of the SSD. \nThen I rebooted with uefi enabled in the computer firmware. I entered the live usb Ubuntu desktop and from there I installed Ubuntu. \nI checked the two boxes saying install updates and software from others. This time the installation went fine.\n\nA: I had the same problem installing Ubuntu MATE 17.04. I was trying to make a dual boot alongside Windows 10. My Windows is on Legacy mode and the UEFI support was enabled in the BIOS settings. I went and disabled UEFI support and the installation completed flawlessly.Hope someone finds this useful.\n\nA: I faced the same problem when I tried to install mint 18 kde on a gigabyte motherboard. My problem was i was trying to boot from usb in Uefi mode.\nYou have too boot in compatibility mode. You most likely need to change some BIOS settings to do that. In my case I had to select \"legacy only\" in boot mode selection.\nIf you boot in compatibility mode you will get a screen that says automatic boot in 10 seconds then you will get a menu\nBut if you boot in Uefi mode you will get the menu directly.\n\nA: Got the exact same message and resolved it by simply connecting my computer to the internet (I was using a USB installer to install to a completely new machine with brand new SSD with nothing on it).\nWhen connected, the installer can download any dependencies missing in the installer, as was required for my setup.\nThe giveaway it was a dependency issue and not a partitioning/disk issue was in the /var/log/syslog file. The message about Grub failing to install can mean a lot of things and generally you should check out /var/log/syslog to find out what the true problem is.\n\nA: You can also create a boot uefi partition, if the system allows it. I have the same problem, and unable the uefi is one option, and is more permanent, but I was in a run so I create the uefi boot partition: the option appears in the same option than /boot, in below \n\nA: I faced the same issue. What worked for me, was during installation, when the installer asks you if you want to install in UEFI mode, tell it no. It should warn you of the repercussions of this, but having done it this route, I've faced no issues.\nThe other solutions I came across while researching this issue involved\n\n\n*\n\n*Rebooting the computer with the same (or another) live disc and running boot repair on the problem computer.\n\n*Watching the install logs and turning off the computer when you see if installing GRUB just before the crash (I suppose this takes timing, though I highly recommend against this. You should always try to refrain from turning off a device while installing anything).\n\n\nA: Had the same error message, turns out I had a corrupted directory in the EFI partition that was causing grub to give up at every install attempt.\nfsck took way too long, so chkdsk from Windows quickly cleaned up the corruption and the second install went fine.\n\nA: I found the above did not really work for me trying to install Ubuntu 16.04 onto a USB stick from another USB stick. After 2 days of heartache, this is what I did to get it going. This gave me a dual boot Windows 10 and Ubuntu installation on the same hard disk and in the process, solved this problem:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use a target hard disk and a source cdrom hardware to install from\n\n*Download /burn to DVD windows 10 (generic for all versions) and ubuntu 16.04.3 versions. Ie 2 installation dvds are created.\n\n*Boot into the live version of ubuntu without installing.\n\n*Delete all partitions on the hard disk using ubuntu’s built in partition manager gparted.\n\n*Boot into systems bios and ensure only UEFI is selected and legacy boot is turned off. Also change boot order to ensure system will first boot from the cdrom if available and disk as 2nd option.\n\n*Insert windows disk and go ahead and install windows (I used windows 10 pro 64 bit) onto the hard drive. You do not need a license to do this – just say you do not have a license when prompted.\n\n*Boot windows and make sure it works. I found it would not shutdown properly but this did not seem to matter. I also allowed windows 10 to go through it full update cycles though this likely did not matter. It just takes ages.\n\n*Now boot again into the live ubuntu. This time use it to reduce the last data partition so as to create room for a ubuntu install. Just leave the free space unallocated. I needed windows anyway so left half the disk size for windows.\n\n*Select the install app built into the ubuntu dvd. Choose option to install alongside existing windows os. I left the default options so as to have it create 2 partitions root and swap in the free space.\n\n\nThat it was. When I now boot I get a prompt to ask whether I want windows or ubuntu or ubuntu advanced with more options. I had spent ages playing around with booting from USB sticks but that cost me a whole 2 days. Using the cdrom and hard disk, old style, seems to have helped.\n\nA: My solution to the problem was the following.\n1) Due to some reason my EFI disk was locked by Windows and that's why Grub was unable to be installed on my EFI.\nI started Windows and shut it down (Windows -> Shut Down -> Shut Down, not restart). NB: in case of restarting, Windows may restart in Fast Restart mode which leaves EFI locked - this is what happened to me.\n2) I run Ubuntu Live Disk, and run Boot-Repair utility (URL) using standard settings.\nAfter this, my system started to boot normally via Grub.\nThe trick was that without item 1 (EFI was locked by Windows) Boot-Repair utility was unable to fix my Grub.\n\nA: The issue itself was in grub package (grub-efi-amd64-signed_1.66.14+2.02~beta2-36ubuntu3.14+linuxmi.deb\nfor details check here).\nWorkaround was to connect to the Internet and check Download updates during installation.\n\nA: just for the record\nI faced the same issue by installing 16.04 on an Acer tmb117\nI erased totally the internal disk using the live usb then rebooted and simply launched installation (standalone, no other system alongside Ubuntu)\nconnection was turned off.\n", "Q: Ubuntu Server unable to create directory in PHP I have setup a little Ubuntu Server for developing some web apps.\nI have a little script that uses mkdir() to create a directory, but i am getting a permission denied, its a simple command\nmkdir($directory);\n\nThe error that im getting is\n[Tue Jun 21 22:27:25.079075 2016] [:error] [pid 21150] [client 192.168.0.8:55413] PHP Warning:  mkdir(): Permission denied in .........\n\nIm also getting permission denied for a few other commands like ftp_get()\nWhen i check the phpinfo() the upload_tmp_dir is set to no value.\nI am not very good at server admin so any help would be greatly appreciated.\nI setup the server from a tutorial, then setup my virtual host from another tutorial.\nThanks Guys :)\n\nA: Make sure Apache has permissions to write to directory where you are trying to create a new directory. \nF.e. if your script is calling mkdir('/var/www/subdir/newdir'), run the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Give apache ownership: sudo chown www-data:www-data /var/www/subdir\n\n*Make directory writable: sudo chmod 770 /var/www/subdir\n", "Q: Sharing connection - IPTABLES I've been trying to configure IPTABLES in my server so I can share the internet from the server with another machine.

(I've never done it, so I cannot verify that the following currently works.)  This answer over on stackoverflow gives detailed instructions to use NppExec to save the current document, and then run it through a perl interpreter.  The (currently) other answer here gives an example of passing the source through the g++ compiler (for C++).\nJust to be clear:  There is no compiler bundled with Notepad++.  You must install another package to have a compiler.  Once you have done so, you can adapt the above to cause Notepad++ to save your source, invoke the compiler on the source, run the resulting executable (which you might eventually want to make condition on a successful build), and show you its console output.\nIf you would prefer a complete IDE (instead of a very fancy editor that can be made into an IDE), see this other question and its several answers.  Note that these also require installation of a compiler (as a separate package).  Some of these include this requirement via package dependencies, but generally do not -- you will still have to install a compiler.

Open the file with gedit: gedit /root/HW_PROBE/LATEST/hw.info/devices.json and you'll probably find in the status field you get \"Status\" : \"failed\"\nIf so, take the first line of the fingerprint driver (will be of the format \"usb:11aa-22bb\")\ngo to https://linux-hardware.org/index.php?view=search and type the \"22bb\" part into the DeviceID field, check the results for your device and see what driver (if any) you need for it to work\n\nA: Click on the launcher Dash button, find the Software & Updates and launch it. At the bottom left of the window, click on the Settings button. Under the first tab, Ubuntu Software, make sure the Community-maintained free and open-source software (universe) is checked. The package list will update if a change was made, and you can then install the package fprintd. Or in a terminal:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install fprintd\n\nRead the man page for instructions on running it.\nman fprintd\n\nThe synopsis is:\nfprintd-enroll [username]\nfprintd-list username [usernames...]\nfprintd-verify [-f finger] [usename]\nfprintd-delete username [usernames...]\n\nThe first thing to do is enroll your username, for example:\nfprintd-enroll -f right-index-finger myusername\n\nThere is another package with \"fingerprint\" in the name which is more GUI-related, but seems to have more problems than fprintd. Even fprintd has problems recognizing prints, and even if it does, you still have the issue of it not being able to open the keyring. So you will still need to type in the password to access that (like for email).

Version 4.4 is the new one, and the latest in the Ubuntu repositories, and version 3.13 is the old one and the one that came with Ubuntu 14.04.\n\nA: You are not running two kernels at the same time. Grub has located many more than two different kernels installed on your system. This commonly happens when the kernel has been updated. Hold down shift while booting your system to display grub, you will then see the option to log into your system with either kernel. It is good to keep two different ones installed in case you have a bad experience with a kernel upgrade, you can then boot into grub and use the older working kernel to get your system stable again.\nYou can remove old kernels if you wish. I think you are identifying the two major kernels on your system 3.x.x and 4.x.x versus the many smaller updates in your 3 kernel\n", "Q: how can I get Ubuntu 32-bit?

And they are catagorised very well . I am looking for a CLI version of this. That is, I would like to browse apps from terminal where I could list all apps under a specific category (say games) .\n\nWhy am I looking for this ?\nIf I could could browse apps from terminal, The search results could be highly customized using tools like grep , awk etc...\n\nA: There already exists command apt-cache dumpavail which will list all available packages from all enabled repositories. Behind the scenes it actually reads from files stored in /var/lib/apt/lists/ directory (I've done strace of the command, and that's what the output shows) . My guess would be that Gnome Software parses those very same files and organizes those into categories.\nProblem is that the actual data has lines that start with Package: for package names and Section: to which they belong, but Section: lines are not organized exactly the same as in Gnome Software.  However, with a little bit of command line magic, we can come close to something like that. What I propose is a function\nfilter_sections()\n{\n  apt-cache dumpavail | \\\n  awk -v SEARCH=\"$@\" '/^Package:/{ PKG=$0  }\\\n    /Section:/ && $0~SEARCH {printf PKG\" \"$0\"\\n\"}'\n}\n\nWith that function we can list all packages by sections, for instance:\n$ filter_sections web | head                                                   \nPackage: apache2 Section: web\nPackage: awstats Section: web\nPackage: curl Section: web\nPackage: heat-api Section: web\nPackage: heat-api-cfn Section: web\nPackage: heat-api-cloudwatch Section: web\nPackage: heat-common Section: web\nPackage: heat-engine Section: web\nPackage: javascript-common Section: web\nPackage: libapache2-mod-apparmor Section: web\n\nThe code itself is fairly simple: we pass on the output of apt-cache dumpavail to awk which stores every package name into a varialbe , and if the Section: line also contains a string that we are matching, we will print both package name and the section.\nAs for listing the sections themselves, it's fairly easy as well\napt-cache dumpavail | awk '/Section:/' | sort | uniq \n\nWhat is also nice about this approach is that some of the Sections mention which repository the package belongs to, for example universe/python or multiverse/web . The function , however, will search for all and of them , but if so desired we can always filter with awk even more\n\nA: You are probably looking for aptitude.\nIf this is not installed in your system, go ahead and open a terminal and type\nsudo apt-get install aptitude then sudo aptitude to start it.\nIf you want to search and filter results with grep, you can use either sudo apt-cache search or sudo aptitude search\n", "Q: Nautilus not launching on Wayland I've installed Ubuntu Gnome 16.04.

I seem to remember that a few years back, in order to login on Windows you had to type Ctrl-Alt-Del to get a login screen.  \nThe advantage of this was that if you had a cat or child that liked to press random keys on your computer keyboard, they wouldn't screw things up.  Well, my kids are in their 40s now, but I do have a cat that likes to walk over the keyboard from time to time, and believe it or not - that requires a reboot to recover from the consequences.\nIs there anything (short of hiding the keyboard) that can be done about this?\n\nA: You can to the same by pressing\nCtrl+Alt+L\nThis will lock the screen and require the password to unlock it.\n\nA: Some related bug reports on Launchpad: \n\n\n*\n\n*Cat causes login screen to hang\n\n*Cat sitting on keyboard crashes lightdm (duplicate of first one)\n\n\nThose bugs describe that lightdm (the package behind your login screen) experiences some kind of keyboard input buffer overflow if you keep on hitting keys on the lock or login screen.\nThe primary bug report mentions that a fix for this bug was finally released for 16.04:\nThey now limit said input buffer to 200 characters to prevent it from getting filled up with insane amounts of data.\n\nSo the hanging up if a cat sits on a keyboard on the login screen should be fixed in 16.04 now (maybe you want to upgrade?). \nHowever, I don't think that older releases would profit from a setting that requires you to hit Ctrl+Alt+Del before logging in, as that would then probably be a feature of lightdm itself again and would likely not help and suffer from the same bug...\n\nA: Place pre-warmed cardboard boxes near the keyboard. The cat will default to sitting in these and will leave your computer alone.\n\nA: Switch to virtual console x (x ≥ 8) (CtrlAltFx, say x = 12). Those don't have getty or LightDM (or anything, really) running on them, so the cat can walk over the keyboard to its heart's content. Then press CtrlAltF7 to get back to LightDM and the login screen.\nYou could automate this during boot by adding chvt 12 to /etc/rc.local (see this U&L post).\nSpecial buttons like the power button might still be a cause for concern.\n\nOn second thought, other key combinations are available:\n\n\n*\n\n*if the virtual console is not running X, then the CtrlAltFx can be used without Ctrl - just AltFx would work.\n\n\n*\n\n*Alt+ arrow keys can also be used to switch to the previous and next VTs\n\n*CtrlAltDel triggers a reboot in any of the VTs not running X.\n\n\n\nSo a better solution might be running an empty X session (not running any other application) in VT12 to cut down the number of available key combinations and switching to it.\nstartx -- :100 vt12 &\nchvt12\n\nThis needs to be tested (you might need to write an .xinitrc to override the defaults).\n\nA: Excessive keyboard input is known to hang the LightDm screen.\nThere is currently no way to prevent the problem from happening, however you can easily remove the characters from the login box by pressing Shift+Home (to select all) then Backspace (to delete). It may take a few seconds before the machine becomes responsive again.\nNote that the issue has been fixed in the next version of Ubuntu.\n", "Q: Is it possible to use libertine on an Aquaris E4.5 yet?

I recently installed ubuntu 16.04 on a machine I built, hoping that it'd serve my home for file sharing, media server and probably for VPN. I have installed Samba and the LAMP server. I also have installed phpmyadmin. Then I have created some folders under 'home' and shared it over my home-network. \nNow, when I try to access them from my windows PCs it won't let me to, and asks a username and password every time. I didn't know initially what credentials to provide, and was providing those which I used to set up the ubuntu server. I was not being granted access. After scouring the internet for 3 straight days, I still can't come up with a solution. I tried adding users with passwords in Samba, and tried logging in with those credentials, but with no avail. I tried editing the samba configuration file as suggested in many ubuntu Q&As, but it differs largely from what described in the pages, and I couldn't even find many of the parameters. The little bit of tweaks that I made in the configuration file couldn't help alleviate the problem. \nPlease help me out with it.

This is done after removing the IP address form the VS port and allocating it to the vs bridge. tcpdump seems to indicate a layer 2 problem. Although this seems to be a common problem with OVS bridges, after Googling around we can't figure out what is wrong.\n\n\nI hope someone can point us in the right direction.\n\nA: Issue seems to be OVS on Ubuntu 16.04 not working out of the box. Ran into the problem with another installation, which worked after the creation of bridges but not after a reboot.\nWhat needs to be done is to follow this great life saving post related to Ubuntu 16.04: Boot integration of the Openvswitch in Ubuntu and then strictly follow the guidance  of the README.Debian.gz file from /usr/share/doc/openvswitch-switch to configure bridges and ports in the /etc/network/interfaces. Below an excerpt of the file.\nExamples:\n--------\nex 1: A standalone bridge.\n\nallow-ovs br0\niface br0 inet static\n    address 192.168.1.1\n    netmask 255.255.255.0\n    ovs_type OVSBridge\n\nex 2: A bridge with one port.\n\nallow-ovs br0\niface br0 inet dhcp\n    ovs_type OVSBridge\n    ovs_ports eth0\n\nallow-br0 eth0\niface eth0 inet manual\n    ovs_bridge br0\n    ovs_type OVSPort\n\nex 3: A bridge with multiple physical ports.\n\nallow-ovs br0\niface br0 inet dhcp\n    ovs_type OVSBridge\n    ovs_ports eth0 eth1\n\nallow-br0 eth0\niface eth0 inet manual\n    ovs_bridge br0\n    ovs_type OVSPort\n\nallow-br0 eth1\niface eth1 inet manual\n    ovs_bridge br0\n    ovs_type OVSPort\n\nNote that options can be combined, I have myself a setup of OVS bridges on the top of linux bridges which seem to work fine.\nThis way setup will survive a reboot in Ubuntu 16.04 (and Openstack will fully work).\n", "Q: python: pip install xmltodict fails I would like to use Ansible on my ubuntu machine.

However when I tried to add the alias it did not work.\nFor example: alias scale_down= heroku ps:scale worker1=0 worker2=0 -r remote_name\nI believe because of the presence of multiple =s in my command, it is not generating a single alias for the entire command but making aliases out of the worker names, which don't work because worker_1=0 in itself makes no sense. \nI have tried adding it with quotes and tried adding it to the source file, but to no avail.

Out of this 64 GB, 4GB was given to swap and then rest 60 GB was where the Ubuntu system directory resides.\nSequentially the drives were marked as (inside gparted live):\nWin7 ---> ext4(/dev/sda4[this 64 GB])\n\nNow ext4 is divided into two logical partition\n\n\n*\n\n*/dev/sda5 (4GB) [SWAP]\n\n*/dev/sda6 (60GB)\n\n\nToday due to lack of space in ubuntu partition I decided to expand its space, by first resizing the big Win7 partition and taking 100 GB from it and then formatting the resultant unalloacted 100 GB to ext4 partition, and thus was create /dev/sda7 (100 GB) as another logical partition inside /dev/sda4 (which is now 164 GB)\nSo logically inside /dev/sda4 the partitions are\n/sda7(100GB) --> /sda5(4GB)[SWAP] --> sda6(60GB)\n\nNOW, Gparted was not able to merge /sda6 and /sda7 due to swap in between them and as a result I formatted swap to ext4\n/sda7(100GB) --> /sda5(4GB)[NO MORE SWAP] --> sda6(60GB)\n\nHere is a screenshot:\n\nThe problem is Gparted is still not able to merge any of these logical partition together as you can see when i click on /sda6 to resize\n\n\nA: *\n\n*When trying to resize internal disk linux partition ALWAYS use a LiveCD/USB, because all internal partitions must be unmounted (not blocked by the installed Ubuntu). You are doing that, which is very good.\n\n*In GParted, right-click on the swap partition and choose swapoff. You can't resize or move it if it's not off (unused). Then move it out of the way, reposition it before or after the ext partitions.\n\n*When trying to merge (any) partitions, make sure they are of the same kind: both either primary, or both logical. To make sure you won't run into trouble, i suggest you first delete one of the two ext partitions, and expand the other to encompass the unformatted space resulted from the deletion.\n\n\nA: You can't \"merge\" partitions in Gparted. You can create, delete, or resize them.\nThere was no need to format swap partition to ext4.\nYou need to unmount your sda6 partition, delete sda5 and sda7, then expand the sda6.\nConsider leaving space for a swap partition and do not forget to add the new  UUID of it to /etc/fstab.\nNote: After you move the start of the / partition the system may not boot. You will need to re-install grub.\n", "Q: Making a snap to run on Ubuntu Touch I am looking to investigate the process of creating snap packages as detailed here - but before I do - would it be possible to compile a programme - specifically FoxtrotGPS - to run on Ubuntu touch? I am not a programmer but I will have a go if this is remotely possible. I know there are other Apps such as OSMscout and Unav but these for me have proved unreliable without a sim card relying on GPS only. This would also mean I could use my pre-prepared traces and maps previously used on my EEEpc running Peppermint.\n\nA: snapd is not integrated with Ubuntu Touch yet, so on the phone or on the tablet, you won't be able to easily install snap packages.\nThat said, you can take a look at https://github.com/ubuntu/snappy-playpen/tree/master/ubuntu-clock-app to see how the Ubuntu Clock app (from the phone) was turned into a snap package, so it can be run on the Unity7 desktop.\nWhat you are after is in the works, but it's not quite there yet.

Originally, Intel-based Macs placed their boot loaders on the OS X system (root, /) partition. With disk encryption and LVM setups, though, Apple had to move the boot loader elsewhere. The logical place to put it was on the EFI System Partition (ESP), but for reasons known (only?) to Apple, they chose instead to put the boot loader on the Recovery HD partition, which already existed as tool for (as you might guess) recovering a damaged installation. rEFInd reports the name of the partition on which a boot loader is stored whenever possible.

I am new to Linux, the main reason I am wanting to use it is to revitalize some older laptops I have. Mainly just for web browsing and some document creation.

I ended up disabling that and it installed. I am not even sure what it exactly means, or if that has something to do with the speed but wanted to mention it.\nAnyways, this laptop was running Visa. When it had Vista \"any\" web browser would pop open much faster than Ubuntu, as well as load the pages in a reasonable time frame.

The main problem is that your graphics card is not good enough - Ubuntu needs a fairly good graphics card. The result is that instead of actually using your graphics card, Ubuntu does everything on the CPU, which is very slow. That's why you're seeing \"Gallium 0.4 iivmpipe\" as your graphics card.\nYou should use a more lightweight variant of Ubuntu, such Ubuntu MATE or Lubuntu. You can also install a more lightweight desktop environment on your existing Ubuntu installation (such as MATE or LXDE, but there are many others too), which will give you much better performance.\n\nA: Try with the alternate-version, that is optimized for older machines.\nOf course 2GB RAM is low memory.

I want to use Ubuntu as primary OS. I made a bootable USB stick using RUFUS, but I can't boot into Ubuntu OS. \nI am tired of changing USB as my 1st preference in boot option!\n\nA: You should install Ubuntu in the same mode as the existing Windows install (UEFI or legacy) -- regardless of what capability your machine has.  If the machine came with Windows 8-10 pre-installed from HP, it's in UEFI mode.  From an OEM, who knows.  An upgrade from Windows 7, probably legacy (Even if it's a UEFI maachine).  You can select which mode it boots from the BIOS/?UEFI Settings.  If you just let the machine decide (compatibility mode, or an ordering like \"legacy first, then UEFI) it may decide wrong, since the Ubuntu install media will boot both ways.  Sometimes the mode selection can be made from the name of the USB device (might have UEFI in it).\nCreating the USB for 16.04 seems to be harder than for earlier versons.  Basically, using a block for block copy like dd seems to be the only successful way --  versions of \"startup-disk-creator\" before 16.04 will likely have problems, 14.04 will certainly fail.\nAfter install, You may have problems with the boot order always putting Windows first, even after you change it to Ubuntu (grub or shim) first with efibootmgr.  Many possible solutions, but one seems to be to rename the Windows bootloader 9/EFI/Micerosoft/Boot/bootmgfw.efi to something so it's not found, and have the Ubuntu bootloader (shim) replacing the default bootloader /EFI/Boot/bootx64.efi.  A copy of grubx64.efi needs to be present in that /EFI/Boot directory too for shim to work.\n --- Edit------\nThe UEFI bootloaders are just files, so you may easily copy, move, and rename them. The Ubuntu installation location is /EFI/ubuntu, and the bootloader file(s) are grubx64.efi and optionally shimx64.efi (if installed with secure boot enabled).  \nIf shimx64.efi is not present, just copy /EFI/ubuntu/grubx64.efi to /EFI/Boot/bootx64.efi.\nIf shimx64 is present, copy /EFI/ubuntu/shimx64.efi to /EFI/Boot/bootx64.efi, and also copy /EFI/ubuntu/grubx64.efi to /EFI/Boot/grubx64.efi (no rename on this copy).\nLeave the grub.cfg file in the /EFI/ubuntu directory, that is where grubx64.efi expects to find it.\n\nSome machines really remove the USB from the bootorder when the machine is booted without it present.  This is inconvenient, but easily worked around by using the one-time boot selection from some function key at power-up.\nSupplying the model how you made the USB  are all relevant to your problem, so I'm just guessing here from other people's problems.\n", "Q: Reinstall Ubuntu option is disabled I have a Ubuntu and Windows on my machine and I have to reinstall Ubuntu without losing any of my data, /home folder, but reinstall ubuntu option is grayed out for some reason. \nWhat should I do in order to reinstall it without losing files and programs?\n\nA: You can click on \"Something Else\" and then manually reinstall it. Choose the same paritions for the same mounts you had before such as /home and root (/) and just make sure the format checkbox is NOT checked.

Additionally, I would have to make some workarounds to assure the network is up before mounting.\nHas anyone an idea what else I may try?\n\nA: This may not be possible any longer by default on Xubuntu 16.04 -- There is a note on the MountWindowsSharesPermanently Ubuntu Help Wiki that offers a workaround though:\n\nNote: Regretfully as from version 3.3.2-1ubuntu3.2 (October 2009) this approach is no longer possible together with the \"user\" option. A security fix prevents reading the credentials file if you don't have read access to it. You will have to pin the packages at version 3.3.2-1ubuntu3 or 3.3.2-1ubuntu3.1 to continue using this approach as non-root.\n\n", "Q: Are log files written to when a buffer fills or in 'realtime'? I have a script running which pipes its output through another script; that wrapper script adds a timestamp to each line of the log. However the data is being written to the log file in chunks of about 8000 characters (roughly 180 lines).  This is causing all of those lines to be timestamped exactly the same.  If the underlying script that is outputting info is run directly in the shell then the outputs appear line by line in real time.\nFor reference the script looks like this:\n#!/bin/bash\npython foo.py | ~/timestamp.sh >> ~/logs/foo.log\nexit\n\nThe timestamp script just adds a, you guessed it, timestamp to every line of output.  That script contains the following:\n#!/bin/bash\nwhile read x; do\n  echo -n `date +%d/%m/%Y\\ %H:%M:%S`;\n  echo -n \" \";\n  echo $x;\ndone\n\nIf I remove the timestamp.sh from the equation the behaviour is exactly the same.  I checked this by running the script and monitoring the log file using tail -f script.log\nIs there a setting that buffers file output before writing it to log files?  Are there other methods I can try to timestamp each line of a log file? I have had this type of thing work before on previous systems but no matter what I try nothing seems to be sorting this.\nThis is all on Ubuntu 14.04.4 x64\n\nA: The root cause is your process, here python, is using libc stdout where the output is line buffered when output to a terminal but block buffered when output to something else, like a pipe here.\nYou can fix the issue either in the python code by explicitly flushing the buffer after each log output:\nsys.stdout.flush()\n\nor by controlling how buffering will be done with some hack:\nstdbuf -oL python foo.py | ~/timestamp.sh >> ~/logs/foo.log\n\nor\nunbuffer python foo.py | ~/timestamp.sh >> ~/logs/foo.log\n\nI would recommend explicitly flushing the buffer in your code (sys.stdout.flush()), as you are the only one to know precisely where the output should be flushed. Line buffering (stdbuf -oL) is slightly less optimized but should be ok given the fact you timestamp per line, and disabling all buffering (unbuffer or heemayl's python -u suggestion) is the worst approach, as far as performance is concerned (although it might be unnoticeable depending on how your python code is writing its output).\n\nA: As the STDOUT stream is block buffered by default (when not going to terminal) by python, you need to make the stream unbuffered (or line buffered).\npython provides a way to make the streams unbuffered, here is the Pythonic way:\npython -u foo.py\n\nSo, your whole command line becomes:\npython -u foo.py | ~/timestamp.sh >> ~/logs/foo.log\n\nFrom man python:\n-u     Force stdin, stdout and stderr to be totally unbuffered\n\n\nI am now aware of your script, but within the script you can flush a certain stream using sys module:\nsys.stdout.flush()\n\n", "Q: How to name a file to be the very first in Nautilus? New versions of Nautilus are cool, because they skip nonalphanumeric letters at the beginning of any file name and sort files according to the first alphanumeric letter (if any). But how to name a file in order to sort it before 0? Assume I have a folder with these files:\n0apple.conf\napricot.xml\nbanana\ncamel.so\ncat.py\ndog.tar.bz\n\nand I want to add a one or two letter prefix to the cat.py in order to sort it before 0apple.conf file. I don't want to change the name, just add a prefix. I also don't want to change others' names. I've already tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*#cat.py and .cat.py names and Greek alphabet prefixes sort file to the end (after\ndog.tar.bz file; . changes also visibility)\n\n*any of ,-\";:-–\\_(?)*+%=<>! prefixes sorts the file between camel.so and dog.tar.bz (like without any prefix).\n\n\nYes, there is an option to add more zeros to be near the beginning, but I want the file name as shortest as possible and at the very first position.\nPS: My language is czech (therefore the collation should be something like cs, cz, czech or cs_CZ).\n\nA: The prefix 0 already makes the file to be sorted at very first in Nautilus. What can come before the very first file? No files could, except directories. This is true regardless of locale in use.\nFile naming\nIn the following example, I first created an empty text file named apple.txt then made multiple copies and rename each of the files by adding single character prefix. I have used only most compatible alphanumeric characters: 0 A á _ - and  (space). This means I have created 7 files in total, plus a directory named apple for reference.\nNote that á is the second letter of Czech, which is found in this article section on Wikipedia. The first letter seems to be same as English: A and a.\nFile sorting\nHow will Nautilus sort these files in different locale environment? Turns out that it is similar but slightly different. See the following screenshot for comparison.\n\nNautilus sorted files in English environment en_US.UTF-8 like this:\napple <-- directory\n0apple.txt\nAapple.txt\náapple.txt\napple.txt <-- original file without prefix\n apple.txt\n_apple.txt\n-apple.txt\n\nNautilus sorted files in Czech environment cs_CZ.UTF-8 like this:\napple <-- directory\n0apple.txt\nAapple.txt\náapple.txt\n apple.txt\napple.txt <-- original file without prefix\n-apple.txt\n_apple.txt\n\nIn both locales, there is no change in order of directory and top 3 files when viewing as list in Nautilus. This already shows that no alphanumeric character can appear before 0apple.txt.\nWorkaround 1\nOne way is to create files with name other than existing \"apple\" with same prefix 0 that precedes the existing one. Creating 0aaa.txt will come before 0apple.txt and so forth.\nUsing this workaround, the files are sorted like this:\n0.txt\n0a.txt\n0aaa.txt\n0apple.txt\n...\n\nThis way, the file 0.txt would be the very first file to appear in Nautilus. No other files can come before 0.txt, unless user want to create a file name .txt (using only a space character).\nWorkaround 2\nSay if apple is already the very first file that can exist and user insists to not rename apple, there is another way: Rename the existing file with higher number prefix from 0apple.txt to 9apple.txt. This will allow other files with lower number prefix 0* to 8* to appear before 9apple.txt.\nUsing this workaround, the files are sorted like this:\n0mango.txt\n1kiwi.txt\n2orange.txt\n...\n9apple.txt\n...\n\nWorkaround 2 is unsuitable, if the 0apple.txt as whole cannot be renamed for whatever reason. Workaround 1 will be more effective since 0.txt will always appear before 0mango.txt or other file names that user can think of.\nHow did I test\nIn my testing, only essential locale packages were installed to prepare Czech environment for running Nautilus in Ubuntu. The quick way to run program in other locale by LANG=<LOCALENAME> nautilus command didn't work. Hence, the following steps.\n\n\n*\n\n*Install these packages language-pack-gnome-cs language-pack-gnome-cs-base language-pack-cs language-pack-cs-base via APT in Terminal\n\n*Go to System Settings > Language and Support\n\n*In Language - Language for menus and windows, drag the entry named čeština (word for \"Czech\" noted by Wikipedia) to above English\n\n*Log out and log in again to take effect\nTested using Nautilus 3.14.3 in Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (Live).\nTL;DR Filename with prefix 0 makes the very first file in Nautilus. No other files, except directories can appear before the very first file.\n\nA: Have you tried space zero as a prefix?\n[ 0cat.py]\nThe other characters you mentioned does not work for me too but space zero works fine.\nYou can also try other combinations of spacial chars and zero, things like: -0cat.pay, _0cat.py, etc. these should work too.\n", "Q: key for scrolling up in gnome terminal to check the history of screen?

Updating the master lists is OK but only if it stays in the context of 12.04. I specifically mean command line, not GUI-based update.\n\nA: Yes, running sudo apt-get update will not change or update anything. \nThe only thing apt-get update does is refresh the local \"cache\" with the list of available software / packages.

Following these steps as a guideline will ensure that you can compile software easily:\n\n\n*\n\n*Let's create a place for our software to live.  This ensures that we do not affect our running system, should something go wrong.  The guide linked below uses /usr/local/src, but I prefer /opt: sudo mkdir /opt/ProgramName.

The --prefix parameter is very important, as this tells make not to install this in your system's default directories.  This also tells you that the package is not managed by apt.\n\n*Now if the configure script crashes, we need to install the missing dependencies. We do this by using tools provided in apt.  Every configure script will generate a file ending in .pc or .log when it errors: apt-file search nameoflogfile.pc will gather the missing dependencies.\n\n*Install the missing dependencies with apt-get install missing-package-names where missing-package-names is the output from Step 5.\n\n*Repeat Step 4.\n\n*Now issue make && make install\n\nYou were missing Step 4.  \nPlease also realize that from your question that Prog.pro is a QT Project file, which requires qmake.

For Emulator based on Nexus ONE (API 27 non-Google) this magic sequence is:\n\n\n*\n\n*place mouse cursor at the emulator header (speaker area) or inside display\n\n*hold down left mouse button\n\n*click right mouse button 4 (four) times\n\n*release left mouse button\n\n\nAfter that my emulator received focus. And this scenario must be repeated each time you'd like to put focus into emulator. Sometimes I need to repeat it to get emulator focused.\nP.S.: Of course, corresponding checkbox in emulator settings should be set \"on\"\n\nA: This worked for me (on Linux Mint 18 XFCE):\nSettings -> Window Manager -> Focus -> Select \"Focus follows mouse\" instead of \"Click to focus\".\n\nA: Some issues with focus as pointed out by stormlord.\nYou can send a \"shake\" gesture from the ADB cli (from shell), this opens the developer menu.\nadb shell input keyevent 82\n\nA: I had this issue and what solved my problem was to set the host's keyboard input language to English (US). I do not know why the emulator does not work with other input languages.\nEDIT: I did not find it as an window focus problem. Maybe it is an issue that needs to be reported, so that it is fixed.\n", "Q: Installing game on Ubuntu I'm trying to install a video game I just downloaded (Heroes of Newerth, and I downloaded the Linux version. The game is a .sh extension.), but I'm having some trouble. I downloaded the newest Ubuntu version monday, I think it's something around 16.04 or something.\nI tried to look at some tutorials on the internet and many of them said I had to go to properties>permissions> check \"allow this file to be executed\" and after that double click the file and a dialog box would appear with the option of running the installation of the game, but no such box showed up.\nDo you know how I can install this game? This is my first time using linux and I don't know that much about computers (only the most basic stuff) and nothing about programing which makes using the terminal very difficult, so please so I guess I need simple answers.\nMy preferred answer would be how to get that promised dialog box with the option to run the game as a normal program.\n\nA: First, open a terminal. (ctrl+alt+t)\nNext, cd into the directory containing the file. So for example, if your file was in the Downloads directory in a folder called \"coolgame\", you would run:\ncd Downloads/coolgame\n\nTo confirm that you are in the right folder, run:\nls -l\n\nAnd make sure you see it in the list.\nNext, you need to give it the executable bit, so that Ubuntu allows you to run it. Assuming the installer is called \"install.sh\", you would do that like so:\nchmod +x install.sh\n\nFinally, to run it, all you have to do is run:\n./install.sh\n\n\nNow if running the installer with the above command says \"you need to be root\" or something like that, then you would need to run this command instead to run the installer:\nsudo ./install.sh\n\n\nA: Open your terminal and cd into the directory you game is on, and then enter the following commands:\ncd ~/your/games/directory\nchmod u+x game.sh\n./game.sh\n\nAlso, you can open the game directory (Downloads perhaps) from file manager and Right Click -> Open in Terminal for your convenience.\n", "Q: Joining streams You normally can pipeline the operations\na | b | c\n\nwhere b takes input from a and sends it to c. It has only one input, generated by a. But what if I want to replace a header in file b. I therefore echo a new header (this is a operation). Additionally, I cat b | dd bs=1 skip=header_size to strip the header from the file. This is bc operation. Now I have two outputs, produced by echo new_header and cat. How do I concatenate them?\n\nA: You asked \"How do I concatenate them?\" - and the answer is, quite simply, with cat:\nNAME\n       cat - concatenate files and print on the standard output\n\nSYNOPSIS\n       cat [OPTION]... [FILE]...\n\nDESCRIPTION\n       Concatenate FILE(s), or standard input, to standard output.\n\n\nNote in particular that its inputs can include standard input, not just files. So for example, you can:\n\n\n*\n\n*mix standard input and files\necho \"new text\" | cat - oldfile > newfile\n\n\n*mix standard input and process substitutions\necho \"new text\" | cat - <(some_command oldfile) > newfile\n\nfor example,\necho \"new header\" | cat - <(dd if=oldfile bs=1 skip=$header_size) > newfile\n\nAlternatively, you could use a here document and embed the command output using command substitution - that's probably a better option if your replacement text consists of more than a single line e.g.\n$ cat > newfile << EOF\nnew\nmulti-line\nheader\n$(dd if=oldfile bs=1 skip=$header_size)\nEOF\n\n\nA: If you don't like shell process substitution voodoo you can also use a simple redirection of a command group:\n{ printf '%s\\n' 'header line 1' 'header line 2' ...; tail -c +$(($header_size+1)) old-file.txt; } > new-file.txt\n\n", "Q: On M10, set \"Notifications\" as default control/notification in UR corner? On the M10, can \"Notfications\" (green envelope) be set as the default tool in the notifications/controls area of the user interface (tablet upper-right corner) so that swiping down from UR corner brings the user directly to the notifications?\n\nA: No, it cannot. There is no \"default\" indicator which is opened when swiping down. Swiping down from the position of the notifications indicator itself, will show the notifications.\n", "Q: Unable to access Ubuntu after Windows install, reinstall grub fails So after installing windows 10, it overrode grub and now Ubuntu is inaccessible.

I do not have physical access to the machine. How would I be able to do it over SSH or in some other way.\n\nA: This question could have multiple answers depending on how you're using 'cloud'?\nTypically cloud would be considered a logical server delivered through virtualization.  Your cloud provider allows you to select an image to boot, which the image could be Ubuntu.  So there isn't really an 'installation' but you still end up with an Ubuntu ready server.\nIf you mean a physical server colocated at a remote location, the best way I've found to get Ubuntu installed is, having your remote hands put the CD into the drive and install Ubuntu over IPMI.  I've done it several times, if all goes well, the disc should only have to put inserted once.\n", "Q: Unity Settings Deamon crash in 16.04 every time after boot Each and every time I boot Ubuntu 16.04 the Ubuntu experienced an internal error window comes up.

It apparently only works for certain resolutions. I currently got my screen working with 1680x1050. The standard for this monitor is 1920x1080. However, at work I have a Dell U2515H (2560x1440) and that resolution doesn't work either.

But just after I enter my password and press Enter my mouse just hangs in thin air, not recognizing any movements or clicks.\nAdditional Info:\n1) Does the mouse even really work?\nAnswer: Yes, I've tried it on various different devices and it works fine. It even works on my laptop running Ubuntu 16.04 LTS with the same Gnome desktop. \nNote: Although I manually installed Gnome on my laptop. But the PC back at home I installed Ubuntu Gnome edition directly from an ISO file\n2) Have you tried Disconnecting and reconnecting?\nAnswer: Yes I have. Thing is, if I disconnect my mouse and reconnect it, it works (click&movement) for a time close to 1 second. Then it dies again :'(\n3) Maybe there is a problem with your system. Checked the Hardware?\nAnswer: Nope I'm running on Dual-boot. And the same mouse works fine on Windows 10.\n4) Is it an extremely new mouse that only works if you install special drivers?\nAnswer: No, I've used it on Ubuntu 14.04 before. It worked fine.\n5) I wonder if you are the only one with this problem.\nAnswer: No, I've seen many people posting about this exact problem (many post only about their touch-pad though). But no one has bothered to explain it in detail. All strongly think Gnome3 is the culprit, but no proper solution is found yet.\nPlease help, I have no idea what to do!!\nEDIT: I have now confirmed that it is indeed a bug related to the Gnome3.18 desktop. I just installed LXQt desktop environment and it works completely fine.\n\nA: Recently, I upgraded from trusty to xenial, via do-release-upgrade and had the same problem. After the upgrade completed, after the system booted, at the gdm login screen, I was unable to click anything with my mouse. I could move it around, and sometimes scroll, but I could not click anything. I had to navigate around with various key shortcuts like alt+tab and alt+f4\nI tried a ps2 mouse, a wireless usb touchpad, and a different mouse. The mouse worked fine in another machine. Dmsg did not seem to show anything useful either. I tried all the obvious, like different usb ports to no avail. I reinstalled gnome-shell and gdm, purging configurations and even trying to update to the latest gnome 3.20. Nothing worked.\nAfter lot of frustration, I installed gnome-session-flashback. That worked after switching to lightdm. The mouse would not click anything on either gdm or gnome3, but gnome2 worked fine. So next I installed kde-plasma, which worked. Than openbox, and mate, which also worked. Next I installed cinnamon, and the mouse worked, except I could not click anything on the status/menu bar down below. Everything else worked though, very odd. But if I understand correctly, cinnamon uses both gnome2 and gnome3 code, so I thought this information could be useful to someone trying to debug.\nBut I really just wanted my Gnome3 back. Finally I managed to fix this bug. I tried disabling my Nvidia proprietary drivers and switched over to Nouveau. After a reboot, gnome3 worked again. If you use any proprietary drivers, try disabling those. Hope that helps.\nUpdate: After disabling nvidia drivers, and switching to Noveau, i than reinstalled the nvidia drivers, and everything worked fine. So that's worth a shot.\n", "Q: alt key shortcuts in pycharm are not working on Ubuntu 16.04 Shortcuts involving the Alt key are not working in pycharm.\nFor example the shortcut for \"finding usages\" on my machine is Alt+F7, but whenever I press this key, my cursor changes from an arrow to a hand (the icon it changes to when you move a window).\nI am using Ubuntu 16.04.\n\nA: The solution that worked for me is described in this Ask Ubuntu answer.\nIn short: if you've already got used to combinations like Alt+F7, you can disable/change default Ubuntu shortcuts which are overlapping with default shortcuts used in PyCharm.\n\nA: All I would like to say is that the solution is simple:\nTurn off Vim Emulation in the Tools menu\n", "Q: Attention required One more step CAPTCHA Why is this Attention Required One more step.

(The Onion Router, a way to anonymize your web browsing) \nMany website owners use free DDOS protection services from CloudFlare. Since many automated website attacks (such as botnets) use Tor to anonymize and hide their identity, CloudFlare forces all Tor users to complete a security check before accessing websites that use their protection services. If this is the case, disabling Tor and connecting directly should remove the security checks.\nAnother possibility is that you live in an area of the world from which Cloudflare has noticed a high number of malicious attacks, and has put extra security in place for IP addresses linked to that geographical area.\n", "Q: login password issue i have a very strange problem.\nIt looks like my keyboard layout is always changing when i try to login my Ubuntu installation.\nMy password contains the character @\nSo the problem is that one time the @ symbol is produced by pressing shift+2 keys and some other time i will have to press shift+\" that is two positions right of L key.\nIf during my work i let it inactive for some minutes and then let the OS lock the screen, then, even i haven't restarted the laptop, some times even forgets the combination that worked some minutes ago and i will always have to try these two combinations to login.\nThis also happens on the terminal when i ask for sudo permissions.\nI really hate this small problem.\nThanks\n\nA: Go to System Settings -> Text Entry and remove all additional input sources from the Input Sources to Use box.\n", "Q: 16.04 system booting to emergency mode. journalctl attached here is a link to the output of journalctl -xb\nhttps://gist.github.com/willrun4fun/714df68b5a38b56dceda4dc86cc92c30\nsystem was running fine.

I have lxd and kvm systems loaded.  Just earlier I had installed this lxc management utility, could this cause it https://lxc-webpanel.github.io/\n\nA: I'd say that you have a memory problem. I assume that you have a UEFI machine, and it doesn't show the memory test on the GRUB screen shown at boot time.\nSince you have 16G RAM, I suspect that you have 4 sticks of 4G RAM in your memory slots, and are configured as interleaved memory.\nFirst I'd try to reseat the existing memory sticks to see if that solves your problem. Power off the machine, unplug the AC power cord, then depress the power button, and you'll probably see the fans spin for a brief second. Now, touch a NEARBY grounded metal pipe to discharge any static electricity. To reseat the RAM, use the memory clips on either side of each RAM stick, and PARTIALLY eject the RAM, and then push it back in to reseat it. Do this for all of your RAM sticks. After that, plug in the AC power cord, and reboot your machine.\nIf that didn't fix the problem, try removing two sticks of RAM (use the same AC power cord removal as above). Look for the RAM sockets to be white/black, and remove the pair from the same colored sockets. Try the machine again. If that didn't help, reinsert the removed RAM, and take out the other pair. Retest the machine.\nGood luck,\nCheers, Al\nedit: Well, if you say that you have 32GB RAM, it appears to only see 16GB, so I may have been correct... If you Google \"BADgran_size\" it'll show you a GRUB fix for this memory problem. After applying the fix, you might be able to add back your cgroup mount.\n\nA: Resolved The install script for that program had added a mount for cgroup to the fstab that prevented systemd from being able to mount it later.

Wrong because:\n\n\n*\n\n*Program can add itself to a shell/file/directory which does the autostart process, so it will run at any login.\n\n\n*If we consider the autostart process clean, without rebooting there is a chance that a process of the program is still active.\n\n*Programs can delete or modify any file in the user home directory (or any other file which a user has write permission to).\n\n\nSo what should we do?\n\n\n*\n\n*I think the only safe way to run a propriety program is running it as another user.\n\n*If running the program as another user somehow is not possible then we should change the autostart files permission so only root can change them. then after closing the program a reboot will do the job.\n\n\nAm I right? Is there anything that I'm missing?\n\nA: Running untrusted software as a new user is a good start, but it may not be enough.\n\n*\n\n*A lot of files and devices you may consider sensitive are world-readable. Even as an unprivileged user, you can extract a lot of information out of a system (typically you can read /etc for a start).\n\n\n*You may not have your own stuff configured properly. For instance, have you made absolutely sure that this \"super-secret-passwords.txt\" file is not readable by everyone? And what about this buggy piece of old software running as yourself or root - are you sure it's not writing anything sensitive to disk?\n\n\n*Code running as nobody can go on the internet and download tasks, execute code on your system.\n\n\n*Sometimes a socket on your local system (a unix domain socket) used for inter process communication may not be secured properly (sometimes for good reason), and any process can read and write on it.\nPractically, there are things you can do.\nYou can absolutely check that the program doesn't start anything at boot time. It'll be tedious and you need to understand your system really well though. There are lots of ways a service can be started automatically. (Note: if the program ever ran as root, all bets are off since it could have modified the init system to hide itself)\nTop tips for running terrible software\n\n*\n\n*Don't run it.\nIf you can avoid it at all, don't run anything you can't trust. At least make sure you are making a sound trade-off. Complexity is the enemy of security. The only line of code that's guaranteed to be secure is the line you never run. :)\n\n*Run the program in a virtual machine.\nSetting up VMs is pretty easy (VirtualBox is great if you don't want to set up any virtualisation infrastructure). This means you'll have a machine that contains no sensitive data (you'd need to have put it there) and you can control the resources it uses. This doesn't give you complete protection of course (It could do things like flood your web server with requests, log in to your lightbulbs via telnet, and so on, plus bugs that let malicious software escape a virtual machines are not very common, but they do happen sometimes).\n\n*Run the program in a container.\nContainers (LXD, Docker) offer some security for running code on your local machine. They are not perfect. But an unprivileged container provides file system isolation for your program, which is something. Securing containers properly is an art and a science, but it's getting rapidly easier.\n\n*Have someone else run the program for you.\nThis is only slightly relevant to your question, but you can sometimes avoid running old, terrible software, or software that is just complex and difficult to secure properly, by using a third party service. Email is a good example of this. I would not trust myself to have the patience and spare time to host and maintain my own email server. It's a lot of work to keep things like this secure.\n\n*Run it as a separate user.\nAs a last resort, and if you feel the trade-off is worth it, run the program with a new user account specially created for that purpose. I do this with software I trust.\n\nOption 1 is the best. :)\nGeneral advice\n\n*\n\n*Your OS is fairly secure. Not completely secure of course, but Ubuntu has a reasonably good track record. Other software you install on it may not be so good. So, run your software on lots of separated, isolated machines. This will ensure that a bug in one program doesn't mean that another program, potentially more sensitive, becomes exploitable.\n\n*Go to the web. Today, most end user software has good alternatives that are on the web. On my machine, I pretty much run Chrome and Emacs, and that's it. Using web services has it's own security implications of course.\n\n*Go to the cloud (for server software). Are you sure you need to run your own email server? Web server? Database? Go to the cloud and let someone else do all of that tedious security stuff for you.\n\n", "Q: Prevent root from resetting a specific user password Is there any way to prevent others including root account from resetting a user password?\nI'd like to protect my user account not to be logged in by others so that others can't see the mounted encrypted folder.\n\nA: No, you cannot prevent root from changing your password. The root user has full control of the system, and if someone can log in as root, they can change your password. Likewise, if another user has access to sudo, you cannot prevent them from changing your password.  \nYou can protect your data by encrypting your home folder. Users who can use sudo (or log in as root) could still change your password, but would not be able to access your data after changing it.\nTo secure the computer from root or other users, you need root access yourself. If you own the computer you should consider:\n\n\n*\n\n*disabling the root user (or setting a password only you know)\n\n*ensuring other users cannot use sudo\n\n*limiting physical access to the machine when possible\n\n*encrypting the hard drive (usually requires reinstalling Ubuntu).\n\n", "Q: upgrade process stuck while Preparing to unpack .../mysql-server-5.7_5.7.12-0ubuntu1.1_amd64.deb I tried to do upgrade and its been \"unpacking\" for too long (20 minutes) is it normal?

log rotate options that might help. \nSee copytruncate in http://www.linuxcommand.org/man_pages/logrotate8.html\nThis will create a copy and truncate the original file. Therefore, the log file doesn't have to be closed and it's held open by your php script.  Some log statements might get dropped between the copy and truncate operation. \n\nA: Meanwhile, my solution (bandage) is done within PHP, but I realise that it may not be the most proper or elegant one.\n<?php\nfunction log_record($str, $file_name) {\n    $n = 0;\n    while ($n < 10) {\n        if (is_readable($file_name)) {\n            file_put_contents($file_name, str_pad($_SERVER[\"REMOTE_ADDR\"], 15, ' ', STR_PAD_RIGHT).'

After I executed the commands and rebooted my touchpad does not respond to touch and the cursor is invisible. I have tried updating the kernel, checking if there was an unknown display.

Here's the code:\ngsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.mouse active false\nsudo apt-get install xserver-xorg-input-mtrack\nsudo apt-get autoremove xserver-xorg-input-synaptics\nsudo rm /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/50-synaptics.conf\nsudo nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf\n  Pasted this inside the nano above: \n       Section \"InputClass\"\n MatchIsTouchpad \"on\"\n Identifier \"Touchpads\"\n Driver \"mtrack\"\n Option \"IgnoreThumb\" \"true\"\n Option \"IgnorePalm\" \"true\"\n Option \"DisableOnPalm\" \"true\"\n Option \"BottomEdge\" \"30\"\n Option \"TapDragEnable\" \"false\"\n Option \"Sensitivity\" \"1.2\"\n Option \"ButtonEnable\" \"true\"\n Option \"ButtonIntegrated\" \"true\"\n Option \"ClickFinger1\" \"1\"\n Option \"ClickFinger2\" \"3\"\n Option \"TapButton1\" \"0\"\n Option \"TapButton2\" \"0\"\n Option \"TapButton3\" \"0\"\n Option \"TapButton4\" \"0\"\nEndSection\n\nAlso this echo \"pointer = 1 2 3 5 4 6 7 8 9 10 11 12\" > ~/.Xmodmap\nPlease help. \n\nA: Hmm... Looks like you were partly lied to. That code disables the touchpad. Luckily, simply reverse it! First, when Ubuntu boots press Alt+F1 to enter the terminal. Type in your username & password to log in. Once in, run the following commands:\ngsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.mouse active false\nsudo apt-get install xserver-xorg-input-synaptics\nsudo apt-get autoremove xserver-xorg-input-mtrack\n\nNext, run this command:\nsudo nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf\n\nand replace the following:\nDriver \"mtrack\" with Driver \"synaptics\"\n\"IgnoreThumb\" \"true\" to \"IgnoreThumb\" \"false\"\nHope this helps!\nEdit:\nIf you need more help, here is another answer that may help:\nHere\n", "Q: How to install redis desktop manager in ubuntu 16.04?

I work in IT and manage a network. My primary desktop throughout the years has been Windows, if for no other reason, than that Microsoft did a great job with accessibility features. No other desktop OS has matched it yet.\nUbuntu shows promise yet it lacks the critical click-lock feature for mouse settings. Microsoft set the bar, yet no other desktop OS has really given accessibility features the attention it deserves. I swear that many years ago this could be implemented in Ubuntu, and prior to the Windows 7 release, I planned on switching.\nBut, I was disappointed to learn that Ubuntu seemed to have chosen the Hover Click (dwell) feature over the click lock. At least it seems that way as when Hover Click appeared the click lock disappeared. I'm not arguing that Hover Click may be useful for some, but, speaking from personal experience, the click lock is immensely more useful and therefore much more important for someone in my situation.\nThis is why Windows is my primary desktop OS to this day. I revisit Ubuntu when new releases come out only to be turned away empty handed so to speak. My philosophy is that if the Ubuntu developers won't give accessibility the attention it deserves, then I won't adopt it as my primary OS. It really is that simple.\nI am excited about the potential of Ubuntu, particularly the Docker and Linux Containers features, and would conceivably switch my primary desktop to Ubuntu for this reason, yet I'm left on the outside looking in, so, Windows 10 is it for me. It is hard to turn down an OS that has set the gold standard for accessibility. \n\nA: See https://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1832185\nTo Quote:\n\nInstall xinput if it's not already, then type \"xinput list\" to see\n  your devices.

Promised myself not to return to windows. I just had delivered to me an OBDII pc device but there is no software to support it in Linux and you can use it of course and I intend to do so but I'm afraid I don't meet the requirements at the moment. So I tried virtual box but no matter what I don't have USB and shared folders on the guest machine. Thought of making it a dual boot machine but it is a single hard drive split in three partition during the OS installation. Tried to partition it using gparted but I think I need to unmount the /dev/sda2 first. That might be possible using a live linux medium. I am concerned about potential data loss start up times and I also think that if windows partitions need to be at the start of the drive,so far left in gparted where my boot efi partition is. Ideally I want to install windows 7 32bit and I am not sure if that's possible considering my current OS is 64bit.

It also shows the same error.\n\n\nA: Well as I guessed you formatted the Hard drive as FAT, which in fact does not allow you file sizes above 4 GB, so either you chop up the data you want to archive, or format it to something more suitable.\nIf you not need to access this HDD on a Windows machine you could simply go for formatting the drive as ext4 (Linux format). Gparted allows you to do this with ease.\nAs well what could be the cause of errors are typos. so make sure you recheck the paths you typed in.\nIf you need indeed to access this drive in a Windows machine you can use exFAT or ntfs. For mounting it then in Linux you need to install exfat-fuse and ntfs-3g by:\nsudo apt-get install exfat* ntfs*\n\nThen you should be able to use bigger file sizes and still mount your drive onto your server.\nSo to mount use the usual you would use with a FAT drive. The sdX should match your actual drive letters.\nsudo mkdir -p /mnt/external\nsudo mount /dev/sdX /mnt/external\n\nIf that really does not suffice then explicitly define the file-system\nsudo mount -t ntfs /dev/sdX /mnt/external\n\n", "Q: ssh X forwarding doesn't work I have ssh access to two non-local Ubuntu servers.

I tried to read this answer Default file permissions for php user www-data but it did not help in my case. \nCan anyone help me? Thank you.\n\nA: Giving the mount point of your SD card partition the correct ownership should do the trick. If you want the user who mounted the SD card to still have ownership permissions, you could change the group of /media/user/name/ and all of the files and folders it contains to www-data with:\nchgrp -R www-data /media/user1/Núbia\n\nEnsure that all of those files and folders have read and write permissions with:\nchmod -R g+rw /media/user1/Núbia\n\nIt's worth getting to grips with permissions, to know whether you're introducing security vulnerabilities, but this should allow you to do what you need for now.\n", "Q: Unable to find pip 2.7 [ERROR] /home/a3/devstack/inc/python:37 Unable to find pip2.7; cannot continue\n++./stack.sh:main:724                       err_trap\n++./stack.sh:err_trap:510                   local r=1\n++./stack.sh:err_trap:511                   set +o xtrace\nstack.sh failed\nError on exit\n./stack.sh: line 494: generate-subunit: command not found\n\n\nA: Elaborating on @Rinzwind's comment: pip is a manager for python packages.

(This application has now changed its way of handling streams such that the phenomenon does not occur anymore; the problem can still be reproduced by manually adjusting streams and may be of interest for other applications.)\nIs there a known way to prevent this?\nSome further observations:\n\n\n*\n\n*This also happens when I adjust the volume of streams manually (with pavucontrol). In particular, this also works for streams from other applications (like ogg123), so it does not seem to be a problem of the application.\n\n*This does not happen if change the volume of an entire output device, just with the streams on pavucontrol’s playback tab.\n\n*The intensity of the click depends on the volume of the sound currently playing in the respective audio stream. It can be best heard with monotonous sounds. The phenomenon is also more prominent if at least one other audio stream is played.\n\n*The phenomenon is also observable for slight volume changes.\n\n*This is not the same as the problem described in: How can I disable the \"popping\" sound when adjusting the volume? The sound is clearly distinct from /usr/share/sounds/freedesktop/stereo/audio-volume-change.oga.\n\n*I have the impression that some update in the last months improved the situation, but did not fully remove the problem. This may also be due to me being an unreliable detector.\n\n*I first encountered this issue in 14.04. It persists in 16.04.\n\n*This happens on multiple machines, so I assume that this is not a hardware problem. They are both Intel devices, however.

On my end, the 'Speaker' channel does not actually need to be unmuted, but it's volume needs to be set to 100 for me to get normal sound. The command I use to do this is\namixer -c 0 set Speaker 100\n\nFor those that really do need to unmute the channel it would be:\namixer -c 0 set speaker 100 unmute\n\nFirst off you need to test this command, if it doesn't do anything, the '-c 0' value is most likely wrong (-c is for card) you can run aplay -l to get a list of all sound devices, you need to find the corresponding 'card number' for your soundcard. (It will normally be 0, sometimes 1, rarely anything else)\nOnce you confirm that the command is doing what it's supposed to, create the script in: /home/user/scripts/headphonefix.sh\n#!/bin/bash\nsleep 0.5 && amixer -c 0 set Speaker 100\n\nWhere '/home/user' is the path to your home folder. (You can use any path you want though, it's just a suggestion).\nNext make the script executable with \nchmod +x /home/user/scripts/headphonefix.sh\n\nNow we're halfway done.\nI'm not on ubuntu myself (I'm using manjaro) but this 'fix' requires the acpid service to be running (I think it's enabled by default on ubuntu, on arch it's systemctl enable acpid to start it on every boot.)\nTo check if the acpid service is running, run acpi_listen. If you get a socket error the service is not running, if you just get a blank output, you're golden.\nWith acpi_listen running plug in your headphones to get the event for it, for me it was: jack/headphone HEADPHONE plug\nNow with that information, we can create this file (use sudo): /etc/acpi/events/headphones\nMake it's contents look something like this:\nevent=jack/headphone HEADPHONE plug\naction=/home/user/scripts/headphonefix.sh\n\nWhere /home/user/scripts/headphonefix.sh is the path to the script we created earlier.\nNow to confirm it's all working, we need to restart acpid either by rebooting or running this command:\nUbuntu: sudo service acpid restart\nArch/Manjaro: systemctl restart acpid\nThen unplug your headphones then plug them back in, and voila, everything should be 'working' now.\nIt's not a perfect solution, since it just makes alsa set the speaker channel's volume to 100% again everytime a headset is plugged in, rather than addressing the underlying issue of why this is happening under the hood. But if you just want shit to work like normal, this'll do the trick.\n(Note: You will also want to run this script automatically on startup in case your headphones are plugged in on bootup) \n", "Q: How to run a function for every specific received packet?

I have ASUS GL552VW laptop with nvidia graphics card and driver nvidia-361 on uefi. Now the problem I am facing is , whenever the computer suspends(Either by clicking manually , or from a long idle ) the computer actually shuts down and restarts when I press keys. \nI have tried the following options \n\n\n*\n\n*Uncomment SAVE_VIDEO_PCI_STATE=true in /etc/default/acpi-support.\n\n*Change GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=\"\" to GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX = \"acpi_sleep=nonvs\".\nBut still it shuts down on suspend. When I click suspend , the login screen is seen momentarily and then the PC shuts down. And when I press some keys , its boots again showing the grub menu. What can I do?\n\nA: It's very strange and it may have worked only for me, but whenever this happens to me, I shut down the computer entirely (power off). Upon restarting, the computer suspends/resumes normally.\n", "Q: How does one package a python application that includes a gsettings schema with setuptools? I'm trying to use setuptools to package a python application that relies on gsettings for storing and retrieving user's preferences. However I have not used said tool before and I am unsure about what to do with the setup.py script in order to instruct it to install and compile the schema.\n\nA: *\n\n*Add your schema to setup.py\nsetup(...,\n      data_files=[('/usr/share/glib-2.0/schemas', ['filename.schema.xml'])]\n     )\n\n\n*Add a system call in setup.py to run:\nglib-compile-schemas /usr/share/glib-2.0/schemas\n\nAs ntc2 commented bellow that this will fail when custom installation path is use, example with --user.\n\n\n*\n\n*One possible solution is to use relative path share/glib-2.0/schemas, That also would imply reconstructing input folder path for glib-compile-schemas command using  sys.prefix variable.\n\n\nA: You can run glib-copmile-schemas in a custom install_data subclass in setup.py. For example, this is how we do it in fluxgui's setup.py:\nfrom distutils.core import setup\nfrom distutils.log import info\nimport distutils.command.install_data, os.path\n\n# On Ubuntu 18.04 both '/usr/local/share/glib-2.0/schemas' (global\n# install) and '~/.local/share/glib-2.0/schemas' (local '--user'\n# install) are on the default search path for glib schemas. The global\n# search paths are in '$XDG_DATA_DIRS'.\ngschema_dir_suffix = 'share/glib-2.0/schemas'\n\ndata_files = [<other data files>,\n    (gschema_dir_suffix, ['apps.fluxgui.gschema.xml'])]\n\nclass install_data(distutils.command.install_data.install_data):\n    def run(self):\n        # Python 3 'super' call.\n        super().run()\n\n        # Compile '*.gschema.xml' to update or create 'gschemas.compiled'.\n        info(\"compiling gsettings schemas\")\n        # Use 'self.install_dir' to build the path, so that it works\n        # for both global and local '--user' installs.\n        gschema_dir = os.path.join(self.install_dir, gschema_dir_suffix)\n        self.spawn([\"glib-compile-schemas\", gschema_dir])\n\nsetup(<other setup args>,\n    cmdclass = {'install_data': install_data})\n\n", "Q: Deluge can't connect to remote seedbox I have successfully installed Ubuntu 16.04 LTS and Deluge 1.3.13 (from deluge-team PPA) but I can't connect to my remote seedbox.\nI'm able to ping remote hostname.\nI can telnet remote hostname and port.\n$ telnet remote.dom 12345\nTrying 12.34.56.7...\nConnected to remote.dom.\n\nI can connect using deluge-console with no error.

Under likewise I was able to do an ssh from my Mac to the Ubuntu box as long as I had a kerberos ticket from Active Directory.

I'll be running some heavy simulations so I need to use my discrete Nvidia GPU with properity drivers.

I was facing the same problem on an Acer laptop where both the keyboard and the touchpad were not working at the same point your keyboard doesn't.  This is how I was able to overcome this problem.  I'm just hoping it's going to work on your system too.\nRight after you press Enter on the Install Ubuntu server option, start pressing random keys on your keyboard at a rate of approximately two per second till you see the next screen appear.  This hack makes the keyboard send the keys you press and eventually it gets detected correctly and it works.\nAs I said, this worked in my case.  It's a very \"low tech\" suggestion but...  who knows?!\n\nA: I was wondering why Ubuntu was being unresponsive when it got the language section. I tried doing what was suggested according to the answers that were put in this thread, unfortunately it still didn't work. \nI had to Disable the \"Legacy USB support\" then my keys became responsive.

I am using Ubuntu 16.04.\n\nA: I found a simple fix.  I didn't have any problems pinging IP addresses; I ran into problems when I tried to issue a command like:\nping google.com\n\nIn other words, I could connect to the internet, as affirmed by the wifi indicator, but I was having problems turning domain names into IP addresses.  This process is handled by the text file /etc/resolv.conf, so I decided perhaps it need to be updated.  I issued the command:\nsudo resolvconf -u\n\nbut Ubuntu spit this back at me:\n/etc/resolvconf/update.d/libc: Warning: /etc/resolv.conf is not a symbolic link to /run/resolvconf/resolv.conf\n\nThis was the source of my problem: somehow /etc/resolv.conf was pointing to /run/resolvconf/resolv.conf .  Fortunately, once I removed the bad symbolic link and created a new symbolic link the wifi worked immediately.  That is, I ran the following commands:\nsudo rm /etc/resolv.conf\nsudo ln -s /run/resolvconf/resolv.conf /etc/resolv.conf\n\nand the wifi was back up!  I hope this simple solution works for you too!\n\nA: knowing how to address a non working internet connection may help as follows.\nopening a terminal and...\nSee if you can ping or traceroute to google's public dns.\nping 8.8.8.8\nmtr 8.8.8.8\n\nIf you get communication with Googl's public DNS then skip down to the last step on DNS. \nIf you're not getting a ping/traceroute to Goole's DNS then start by making sure your wireless addapter is getting IP information with the command.\nifconfig\n\noutput should have ip information listed for your wireless adapter something like...\nwlan0   Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 00:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx\n    inet addr:192.168.1.55  Bcast:192.168.1.255  Mask:255.255.255.0\n\nnext check to make sure you have a default route\nroute\n\noutput should have a route something like...\ndefault         192.168.1.1    0.0.0.0         UG    0      0        0 wlan0\n\nAt this point you should be able to ping and/or traceroute to Google's public DNS \"8.8.8.8\".  If not then call your Internet provider for additional help with your internet connection.\nNow that we can ping google's public DNS we can be well assured that our internet is working. If you're still having problems then your computer is most likely not reaching a working DNS service.  You can check your DNS servers with...\ncat /etc/resolv.conf \n\nYou should also check the connection status in your network manager if you're using a desktop version of ubuntu. Once you have identified/set your DNS servers make sure you can ping them as well.  If you can ping the DNS servers that you have set then the problem resides above the network layer in a firewall or application issue.\n\nA: This may help.\nWhen I loaded Ubuntu 16.04.1 on my old desktop I already had Windows Vista installed. \nAlthough I used a second reformated HD disk Ubuntu keeps track of the Windows operating systems and will allow you to boot to it as an option. \nThis seems to interfere with the WiFi it connected correctly but would not access the internet and nothing I did would fix.\nI removed the original Windows disk from the system and reinstalled Ubuntu and now have no problems with my Wifi.\n\nA: /etc/resolv.conf contained a local IP-configuration-definition (did not occur via LAN), which I commented out according to https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJpPltoXpIs\n\nA: Check if systemd-resolved is running  sudo systemctl status systemd-resolved\nMine wasn't, so I started it.\nsudo systemctl start systemd-resolved\nsudo systemctl restart network-manager\n\nNow I have access.\n\nA: In my case, after installing KDE NEON i had the same issue.\nResolved following the instructions on this post Connected to the wireless but no internet access and moosee333 instructions on resolv.conf file.\nMy resolv.conf has this values (default ones on live usb):\nnameserver 127.0.0.53\nIn my OS the resolv.conf file is located in /run/NetworkManager/ with a symlink in /etc/\nI had to undo the firt part of the instructions about NetworkManager.conf, because that left the machine without wifi.\nI hope this comment help other users.\nThank God for this great community.\n", "Q: Installing 3rd party C library.

After hours of tweaking and brute forcing, I finally found a configuration of firmware files and board files from various git repositories. For my system, I needed the kvalo board-2.bin and the atondwal board.bin and firmware-5.bin. For anyone who has the same problem as me, these can be found from:\nhttps://github.com/kvalo/ath10k-firmware\nand\nhttps://github.com/atondwal/ath10k-firmware\nJust try different combinations of firmwares and board files from these repositories until you find the right one.

The problem is that the Windows network doesn't have any password authentication enabled.

There, you shall find and right down your Computer's Name, e.g. «Alex-PC». That is the username that Ubuntu 16.04 is asking for.\nSecondly, give as password your Ubuntu's 16.04 system password and voila, you are ready to go. \nP.S.: Keep in mind that you must have disabled network need for password from your Windows 7 advanced network options.\n", "Q: Is it insecure to to have a password on the clipboard? So I've been using truecrypt for several years now. About 6 months ago before I learned off my password (it was really long and I didn't want it vulnerable to word-lists) I used to copy and paste it from a text file. \nI don't have swap space enabled but I was wondering would my password be recoverable? I used srm on the text-file and I did an sfill on the file-system so that should remove it from the file-system does anyone know if the clipboard is stored on the hard disk or the ram? any thoughts?\n\nA: After seeing the curious post I decided to do a little research. It appears that in any windowing system (e.g. X windows, etc) you have a common space that holds the contents of the clipboard. As such, it is available to any program that can pull from the clipboard. As such, I would expect the clipboard to be just as insecure as any other input device with the caveat being that it is going to be worse than, say, a keyboard.  For example, suppose Malware was installed on your computer that could read your keystrokes anything you type would be insecure. I see no reason some other malware couldn't just access the clipboard periodically to check for contents. While that would be a decidedly less efficient way of swiping your password it could get at your bits and bytes. \nhttps://github.com/astrand/xclip/blob/master/README\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Window_selection\nI am no expert on this stuff so I welcome anyone else's better answer. Just about everything I said above is quite speculative.\n\nA: The clipboard seems readable by any program, so as long as you trust your OS & programs it should be safe enough - KeePass uses the clipboard, I think LastPass does too? If you're running malware you're already \"hooped.\"\nBut I don't think the clipboard is routinely  written to a file (unless you run a clipboard manager / saving program like ClipMan) but there are a lot of different desktops... I think XFCE & Gnome / Unity don't.\nThe far greater security risk is saving your passphrase to a plain text file in the first place. Should've used a program like KeePass or LastPass, or piped an echo to gpg & save it encrypted, then only decrypt to screen/console or extract to ram (ramfs, or tmpfs if no swap - fun fact: tmpfs can be swapped ). \nshred isn't guaranteed to overwrite a file, and I wouldn't expect srm to be better. And on flash memory (SSD, USB pendrive, etc) any  sector can be internally  remapped at any time, even filling the whole drive you may never be sure anything is truly overwritten.\n", "Q: PacketTracer

problem due to the mixture of QT versions on app folder and the system, so this method makes the packettracer to use the system libraries mostly.\nassuming default install dir /opt/pt\n1- create a directory call libwebkit and copy all the libqtwebkit of packettracer to the directory or\n$ sudo mkdir /opt/pt/libwebkit\n$ sudo cp /opt/pt/lib/libQtWebKit.so* /opt/pt/libwebkit/\n\n2- then to run packettracer using the following command\n$  LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/pt/libwebkit/ /opt/pt/bin/PacketTracer7\n\nThanks to Dara Theam \n3- So you have to edit init script /opt/pt/packettracer to this:\n#!/bin/bash\necho Starting Packet Tracer 7.0 \nPTDIR=/opt/pt\nexport LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$PTDIR/libwebkit/\npushd $PTDIR/bin > /dev/null\n./PacketTracer7 \"$@\" > /dev/null 2>&1\npopd >

The second option works as intended, with the terminal asking for my password then running the command.\nIs there a way to run the program directly? Currently it doesn't work (presumably because it cannot run the sudo command without password)\n\nA: Replace sudo with gksudo -- in your script, like this:\ngksudo -- sh -c \"sync; echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches\"\n\nThat will open a simple dialogue window to ask for your password instead of prompting you for it on STDERR which is not connected to a terminal if you run the script from your desktop.\nOn newer releases of Ubuntu, gksudo might not be preinstalled any more.

In that case, the solution is to create a symlink for the connection. This is done using udev.\n\n*The Arduino randomly changes USB port, without being physically unplugged or the computer to be rebooted.

Modem/Networkcard\n\n\nA: From your lsusb output I figure you are talking about a Huawei E352 USB 3G/4G modem, provided by T-Mobile NL. Most likely this is a Windows-induced problem. Windows first needs to install USB modem drivers to be able to mount the device as such. Instead of delivering a mini CD with drivers along with the USB modem, Huawei (and others) install some flash storage on their devices. So the device will be initially mounted as flash storage. Then, on a Windows machine, the installer will install the modem drivers and finally change the devices settings so it will be recognised as a modem next time.\nFor Linux users this is confusing, since their systems too will first recognise the flash storage, but not the modem. And the flash storage is not needed since the Linux kernel already has all necessary drivers onboard. I do not think you need to install any drivers.\nWhat you need is the usb-modeswitch tool. Install it from the Ubuntu repositories:\nsudo apt-get install usb-modeswitch\n\nThe following commands need to be run as root. So pay proper attention to what you are doing!\nConnect your modem and find the vendor ID and product ID for your Huawei:\nlsusb | grep Huawei\n\nYou will find what you already knew:\nBus 002 Device 003: ID 12d1:14fe Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. Modem\n\nThe vendor ID is '12d1' and the product ID is '14fe'.\nusb-modeswitch has a lot of ready configuration files in a tar-archive. First find your device's configuration file in the archive:\ngrep 12d1 /lib/udev/rules.d/40-usb_modeswitch.rules ATTRS{idVendor}==\"12d1\", ATTR{bInterfaceNumber}==\"00\", ATTR{bInterfaceClass}==\"08\", RUN+=\"usb_modeswitch '%b/%k'\"\n\nThen extract your configuration file from the archive:\ntar xf /usr/share/usb_modeswitch/configPack.tar.gz 12d1\\:14fe\n\nAnd bring it up:\ncat 12d1\\14fe\n\nIt wil probably say:\n# T-Mobile NL (Huawei E352)\nTargetVendor=0x12d1\nTargetProductList=\"1506,150f,151d\"\nHuaweiNewMode=1\n\nFinally change the setting on your Huawei device:\nusb_modeswitch -v 12d1 -p 14fe -c 12d1\\:14fe\n\nNow the flash storage driver will be detached and the modem driver activated. To check if everything went well run lsusb once more:\nlsusb | grep Huawei\n\nIf all is well, you should see another product ID. A minor change with huge usability consequences.\nAfter this you can set up your 3G/4G internet connection as usual with Network Manager. Make sure you switch off your WiFi, since WiFi and GSM will not run alongside each other.\nIf you want to keep track of your data use, install the vnstat package.

At some point something seems to have completed in the background because lsblk shows nothing and the snap interfaces query shows nothing.\n\nA: The snap command is actually made up of two components, server and client. You're interacting with the client. When you cancelled the install operation on the client side that's the only place you cancelled it-- the client. So it stopped showing you that it was installing, but it was still installing (this is a bug). (Update: This bug was fixed in snapd v2.20.1.)\nOn the server side, all of this stuff is happening in \"changes.\" You can read more about them here, but for your purposes, you want to just abort this specific change. To do that, run:\n$ snap changes\n<snip>\n203  Doing   2016-06-24T12:17:45Z  -  Install \"nextcloud\" snap\n\nNote the ID, 203, and the fact that it's \"Doing\" it right now. To abort that operation, you use the change ID:\n$ sudo snap abort 203\n\nAnd the change should stop. However, I must say that the fact that the change froze partway through does not bode well for your ability to abort it. If it doesn't work, perhaps try rebooting.

The error message says No bootable devices found.\nI was warned during the installation that I could not continue if I don't select/create an EFI partition. I saw that there was already one (sda1) with a size of 524 MB, so I did it there.\nI tried with Boot-Repair but didn't work. The output is at pastebin.ubuntu.com\nIn the BIOS setup I tried with and without EFI and with/without Legacy ROMs.\nThanks in advance for the help!\n\nA: First, a clarification: Your title says you upgraded to 16.04. Does this mean that an earlier Ubuntu had been installed and was booting correctly? If so, what version? This is important mainly to establish a baseline -- if Ubuntu was installed and booting, then we know that your computer is capable of booting it correctly, which rules out certain possible explanations, such as a badly buggy firmware.\nBoth Ubuntu and Windows appear to be installed in EFI mode, with no trace of a former BIOS/CSM/legacy-mode installation. There's an NVRAM entry that points to the Ubuntu boot loader (check the efibootmgr data in your Boot Repair output), but it's clearly not working. This can happen because of a defective firmware or because of corrupted data in the NVRAM. It could also be that the system is trying to boot in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode for some reason. Therefore, my first suggestion is to enter your firmware setup utility and disable any hint of BIOS-mode support. This is most likely to be referred to as \"legacy boot support,\" an active \"Compatibility Support Module (CSM),\" or something else. It could be flipped, though; you might need to ensure that EFI/UEFI-mode booting is enabled, and favored over BIOS/CSM/legacy booting.\nIf that doesn't help, then I suggest you try the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Enter your firmware setup utility.\n\n*Locate the option to reset all options to their defaults and use it. This will probably wipe out the existing boot entries.\n\n*Re-run Boot Repair.\n\n\nIf that doesn't help, then try entering the Advanced menu in Boot Repair and selecting the option to back up and rename boot loaders. This is an ugly hack of a workaround for buggy EFIs that ignore their boot entries, which seems to be what's happening on your system. This should not be necessary if you previously had a working Ubuntu installation on the computer, but it may be necessary if this is your first Ubuntu installation and your firmware is buggy. (A better option in this case is to return the computer to the store for a refund and get something that's not broken, but this may not be possible if you're beyond the return period.)\n\nA: In the end I had to select the option to complete erase the hard disk and install Ubuntu. That was the only way to make it boot.\nI had tried every single answer I found on Internet and changed the settings in the BIOS/UEFI, but nothing helped me. Of course I followed the suggestions from @rod-smith but unfortunately without success.\n", "Q: How can I check the version of libusb-1.0 running on ubuntu 14.04?

I am using SSHFS with reconnect attribute. It works fine, when I suspend notebook and start it again. But problem is when I take notebook somewhere - meaning different IP and different connection (might be Wifi or Ethernet). \nMounted SSHFS folder just freezes and also freezes all the applications which were using it. And the only solution to it I have so far is to use\nsudo umount -f /mnt/sshfs_folder\n\nWhich is nowhere near to beeing good solution, but so far the only which works. Is there a way how to make SSHFS seemlessly take care of this problem so changing network connection after suspend will not cause any problems ?\nOh and I have Ubuntu 14.04, but I suppose that this is SSHFS specific.\n\nA: I wrote a shell script called sshfs-reconnect with the following:\nwhile true\ndo\n    sshfs -f -o ConnectTimeout=3,ConnectionAttempts=1,ServerAliveInterval=5,ServerAliveCountMax=3 $@\n    echo \"disconnected from $@\"\n    sleep 3\n    echo \"retry $@ ...\"\ndone\n\nIf I leave this running in the background, it has most of the desired behaviors:\n\n*\n\n*If the server disappears briefly, processes accessing the mount will hang until the server comes back\n\n*If the server disappears for too long (about 15 seconds in this case) then waiting processes will get an I/O error\n\n*If we try to access the mount again while the server is gone, we either get a \"transport endpoint is not connected\" error or file-not-found (I would prefer to get only the transport error, but haven't figured out how to achieve that)\n\n*Once the server comes back, we can access the mount again with no intervention\n\nDetails about this solution:\n\n*\n\n*I do not use -o reconnect here because I do not want sshfs to attempt to reconnect indefinitely, since this causes any process waiting on the mounted filesystem to hang forever. Instead, I let sshfs disconnect after a certain timeout and let those waiting processes fail gracefully.\n\n*The options ServerAliveInterval=5,ServerAliveCountMax=3 say that ssh checks every 5 seconds to see whether the remote server is still responding. If it does not receive a response after 3 of these checks, then it disconnects automatically. Thus any process waiting on this mount should hang about 15 seconds max.\n\n*The options ConnectTimeout=3,ConnectionAttempts=1 are necessary because otherwise ssh will wait a very long time when attempting to reestablish connections, which again causes other processes to hang if they try to access the mount during this time.\n\n\nA: More thorough answer here: SSHFS - auto reconnect.\nIn short, use:\n# create local folder to mount into\nmkdir -p ~/mnt/my_server\n\n# now mount your SSH File System\nsshfs -o reconnect,ServerAliveInterval=15,ServerAliveCountMax=3 \\\nusername@server_hostname:/path/on/server/to/mount ~/mnt/my_server\n\nTo unmount the file system:\nsudo umount ~/mnt/my_server\n\n\nAdded July 2022:\nI am not sure, but it may be important to ensure that both sides have the same version of sshfs installed. That means that both the computer you are running sshfs on and the computer you are connecting to should have the same version. Check the version with sshfs -V. Here is an example run of that command on my Ubuntu 20.04 computer, for example, showing both the command and the output:\n$ sshfs -V\nSSHFS version 3.7.1\nFUSE library version 3.9.0\nusing FUSE kernel interface version 7.31\nfusermount3 version: 3.9.0\n\nYou can see that the last line above is the output from the command fusermount -V, which for me shows this:\n$ fusermount -V\nfusermount3 version: 3.9.0\n\nI have used the above command on Ubuntu 14.04, 16.04, 18.04, and 20.04.

I'd previously used this exact hardware to run dual monitor. I plug a DVI (my main monitor) in and an HDMI that runs to a HD TV in another room. When I installed 16.04 the setup worked perfectly. \nAll I had to do was switch Audio Configuration to change sound from one to the other. Yesterday, I updated the system and suddenly, when the desktop is on the TV is black. \nSo I tried to change the configuration with the GUI Display Configuration Utility but could not fix it. If I leave the HDMI plugged in the Display configuration shows that both are recognized, but only one screen can be seen at a time. \nUnplugging HDMI brings the regular monitor back, plugging the HDMI in switches the output to the TV. When I login, I can see the dual screen on both until I finish the boot, then it starts this behavior. \n\nA: I have a similar setup, different gpu version and using VGA and DVI.

It is not a script file, but rather consists of assignment expressions, one per line.\"\nSo...

I have successfully installed Remmina in a new libertine container but haven't tested a lot with that yet. I have only used it to connect to Windows VM's so far.\nTo install Remmina:\nStart by adding a new libertine-container: libertine-container-manager create --id vivid --type chroot --name 'vivid' and then install remmina with libertine-container-manager install-package -i vivid -p remmina. \nOnce that is done you'll need a desktop shortcut which is a .desktop file in ~/.local/share/applications. \nThis file is called vivid_remmina_0.0.desktop and contains:\n[Desktop Entry]\nVersion=1.0\nName=Remmina\nExec=/bin/true\nType=Application\nStartupNotify=true\nIcon=/home/phablet/.cache/libertine-container/vivid/rootfs/usr/share/icons/hicolor/48x48/apps/remmina.png\nKeywords=Libertine\nNotShowIn=Unity;\nX-Ubuntu-Touch=true\nX-Ubuntu-XMir-Enable=true\n", "Q: Firefox opens downloaded PDFs in File Roller When I download a PDF and try to open it from the Downloads window, it will attempt to open it in File Roller, which will complain that about PDF not being a supported archive type; I'd like to open it in Document Viewer instead. How do I do that from Firefox, other than going through Nautilus?\nWhen opening the PDF from Nautilus, it opens the file correctly in Document viewer. I also went in about:preferences#applications and set Use Document Viewer (default) as the action for PDFs, but it didn't work.\n\nA: Firefox uses its own rules on how to handle file types and can be different than Nautilus.\nClick the Firefox menu button and select Options.\nIn Options, click Applications then select the file type PDF.\nIn the Action section, change the action for how you want to open the file.\nIf it's already set, change it to something else, and then back to the PDF viewer.\n\nA: There are several settings for PDFs in Firefox - for different MIME content types - see the screenshot.\n\nIs it possible that you changed just one of the lines to Use Document Viewer (default), but at least one of the others is still configured to use File Roller?\nPlease note that, to my knowledge, you cannot configure the other lines to be opened directly in Firefox.

To have a solution for all files (as said in this answer), run: \ncd .local/share/applications/\nln -s mimeapps.list defaults.list\n\nIn case this stops working: see that the undesired application is not again selected under about:preferences: be sure \"Always ask\" is selected there. Setting manually a different program (even the default for your file-type at system level, but which is not marked as \"default\" in the list for your file under about:preferences) might not work.\nTested in Firefox 60.0 in Kubuntu 18.04.\n\nSomething is not right with the Firefox settings. \"Always ask\" and \"Save file\" do not make sense for files already downloaded, therefore settings under about:preferences shouldn't affect the Downloads list. But they do. And they do in an inconsistent manner: only selecting the application marked as default is followed, switching to another application is not. To reverse that one might need to select \"Always ask\" and then follow the steps mentioned above.\n", "Q: Xbox One Controller Ubuntu 16.04 I've got some problems with my xbox one controller.

But when I tried to create a new folder called .theme, I get an error saying that the name is already in use and I cannot use .theme. But there is no folder in my home directory titled .theme.\nI'm using Ubuntu Desktop 16.04.\n\nA: The .theme directory is hidden by default because of the . at the front of its name. Press Ctrl+H to see all hidden directories (and files).\nIf you want to permanently see all hidden directories and files, open a Nautilus window and go to \"Edit\" -> \"Preferences\" and check the \"Show hidden and backup files\" box.

Decided on Xubuntu 16.04\nORIGINAL POST\nIf you have had success installing Ubuntu on the 1000HE: please state this in the first sentence of your response.  \nI was unable to boot from USB so I have a few questions. I tinkered with the BIOS settings (per youTube and other websites) and only the SATA HDD would show up as a bootable device option.  ESC lists boot options.\nQuestions:\n1) Is it possible to boot from USB?  Maybe I missed a step.  Bonus if you successfully performed this and reply with the specifics of the procedure.\n2) What sacrifices / shortcoming should be expected with Ubuntu that are specific to the 1000HE?\n3) Is there a technique to configure a SATA drive with another PC to install Ubuntu?  The drive would be configured as bootable and the 1000HE would boot the drive and Ubuntu would configure itself. Maybe a transplant from another donor Ubuntu PC?\nI found this link regarding Ubuntu and the 1000HE  but the issues was with Ubuntu 9.04 in 2009.  I look-forward to a post indicating success and pitfalls to avoid.

For that reason, you'll probably want to install a lighter flavour like Lubuntu.\n\n*This answer says you can install Ubuntu on another computer, and just swap the drive - nothing too complicated. Just make sure you install the right architecture for the receiving computer. I suggest 32bit because the machine is older and only has 1GB of RAM.\n\n", "Q: i want to add partition on my old ubuntu which has no additional drive gParted is not working with the dragging and moving. no 'new partition' option is showing, how can i do additional partition? i am using ubuntu 16.04 LTS.\n\n\n\nA: On the first image, you can see a key next to your sda1 which means that you can not change the size of this partition. The reason for this is that you are running your system on this drive. When resizing the partition blocks may be moved which is dangerous on a running system.\nSolution:\nDownload a live system of your choice like Ubuntu or Parted Magic and burn it on a CD or a USB stick. When running a live system you can change the size of the partition. After starting the live system also make sure that the partition you want to resize is not mounted. If it is you have to unmount it using parted itself or via terminal typing: umount /dev/sda1 if the partition you want to change is on sda1.\n", "Q: Cloud Lubuntu - Complete OS in a cloud This is my first post on askubuntu, so if I did something wrong, just tell me and I'll correct it if necessary.\nIs there a way to sync my lubuntu OS with a cloud? so that all the installed programs and configurations (basically the whole installed OS) can be synced between multiple PC's.\nI already have a cloud-server (seafile), which syncs all my data between my laptop and desktop. But I was wondering if i could also sync all the installed programs and configurations between these devices. So that when i install an addon in firefox, or a new program in lubuntu. That this will also be installed on my other device via the cloud server.\nI tried to search info about this for a while now, but i only get results about how to install a cloud server on linux and about Cloud OS but nothing like this. Maybe i'm completely using the wrong search terms, is there even a name for this?\nI don't want to load everything on boot from a cloud like a cloud OS. I only want to download the changes, and that the OS can boot even without an internet connection (I understand that the changes aren't saved to a cloud in such a case)\n\nA: I cannot speak to your specific cloud service, but you might be able to achieve your desired result with rsync. I have used this to sync directories in a master/slave configuration between computers, and I imagine that this could be extended pretty easily.\n", "Q: Cannot open Android project first time in new install of Android SDK in Eclipse IDE Primary topic:\nPlease help me with a problem encountered in attempt to begin Android project in Eclipse.

Believe it or not, the Unix ecosystem was designed with this in mind, and your shell will definitely give you a way to do it.\nIf you want to feed a file through a \"pipeline\" of commands, you use the | (pipe) character in bash (presumably, the shell you are using).\nSome other useful tools are worth mentioning here too: the \"cat\" utility, and the \">\" redirection operator.\nLet's assume your file is called input.txt, and you want to run it through your pipeline and call the result output.txt.\nLet's build up our command piece by piece:\n$ cat input.txt\n\nHere's that \"cat\" I was talking about. For all intents and purposes, it just produces the content of your file. Now, let's add the first command in our pipeline: the \"remove non-alphabet\" part. I'll take a piece out of heemayl's sed command to do this:\n$ cat input.txt | sed 's/[^[:alpha:]]/_/g'\n\nLearning sed and regular expressions is a whole 'nother beast, so let's just be content that this command does what we want for now. Adding on the next piece:\n$ cat input.txt | sed 's/[^[:alpha:]]/_/g' | tr 'A-Z' 'a-z'\n\nI've taken a different approach than heemayl for this one, but it does the same job. Finally, let's put the output in the destination we want:\n$ cat input.txt | sed 's/[^[:alpha:]]/_/g' | tr 'A-Z' 'a-z' > output.txt\n\nThere we go, we've done it. You can string as many commands together as you want with the | operator, then put the output in a file using >. This is a very common task in the command-line environment, so it's good to know what's going on and get used to using it. ;)\n", "Q: IndexError: list index out of range when installing iPython in Ubuntu 14.04 I am following this and I am getting:\ngsamaras@gsamaras-A15:~$ sudo pip install \"ipython[notebook]\"\nDownloading/unpacking ipython[notebook]\n  Downloading ipython-4.2.0-py2-none-any.whl (736kB): 736kB downloaded\nRequirement already satisfied (use --upgrade to upgrade): setuptools>=18.5 in /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages (from ipython[notebook])\nRequirement already satisfied (use --upgrade to upgrade): decorator in /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages (from ipython[notebook])\nDownloading/unpacking pickleshare (from ipython[notebook])\n  Downloading pickleshare-0.7.2-py2.py3-none-any.whl\nDownloading/unpacking traitlets (from ipython[notebook])\n  Downloading traitlets-4.2.1-py2.py3-none-any.whl (67kB): 67kB downloaded\nRequirement already satisfied (use --upgrade to upgrade): pexpect; sys_platform != \"win32\" in /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages (from ipython[notebook])\nDownloading/unpacking simplegeneric>0.8 (from ipython[notebook])\n  Downloading simplegeneric-0.8.1.zip\n  Running setup.py (path:/tmp/pip_build_root/simplegeneric/setup.py) egg_info for package simplegeneric\n\nDownloading/unpacking backports.shutil-get-terminal-size (from ipython[notebook])\n  Downloading backports.shutil_get_terminal_size-1.0.0-py2.py3-none-any.whl\nCleaning up...\nException:\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/pip/basecommand.py\", line 122, in main\n    status = self.run(options, args)\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/pip/commands/install.py\", line 278, in run\n    requirement_set.prepare_files(finder, force_root_egg_info=self.bundle, bundle=self.bundle)\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/pip/req.py\", line 1091, in prepare_files\n    req_to_install.check_if_exists()\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/pip/req.py\", line 811, in check_if_exists\n    self.satisfied_by = pkg_resources.get_distribution(self.req)\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/pkg_resources/__init__.py\", line 535, in get_distribution\n    dist = get_provider(dist)\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/pkg_resources/__init__.py\", line 415, in get_provider\n    return working_set.find(moduleOrReq) or require(str(moduleOrReq))[0]\nIndexError: list index out of range\n\nStoring debug log for failure in /home/gsamaras/.pip/pip.log\n\nHow to bypass this?\n\nEdit:\ngsamaras@gsamaras-A15:~$ sudo pip install -U pip\nDownloading/unpacking pip from https://pypi.python.org/packages/9c/32/004ce0852e0a127f07f358b715015763273799bd798956fa930814b60f39/pip-8.1.2-py2.py3-none-any.whl#md5=0570520434c5b600d89ec95393b2650b\n  Downloading pip-8.1.2-py2.py3-none-any.whl (1.2MB): 1.2MB downloaded\nInstalling collected packages: pip\n  Found existing installation: pip 1.5.4\n    Not uninstalling pip at /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages, owned by OS\nSuccessfully installed pip\nCleaning up...\n\n\nA: This is probably caused by having an outdated version of pip.

On OS X (or I guess we're calling it macOS now) if I click on an inactive window, it does not register the click, but simply makes that window the active window. For example, if I click on a text editor, I can click anywhere on the window, and it will not move the cursor to where I clicked, it will just bring that text editor window to the front and make it the active window.\nI'm not sure what that's called, but I'd really like to get that behavior on Ubuntu. Is that possible?\n\nA: Okay so no one has answered yet. I would really like someone to, but in the meantime, I have a \"workaround\". If you hold Alt while clicking on a window, it won't register the click. This is normally used for \"dragging\" the window, so while you're holding Alt, all windows will be draggable from anywhere, not just the titlebar. If you just click, it will bring the window into focus, but it won't actually click in the window. Hope this helps someone.\n\nA: Yes, it is possible by using middle-click on mouse.\nMiddle-click behaviour\nA middle-click will usually give focus the window under cursor, then raise it above other windows. This page from Ubuntu Desktop Guide explains the known behaviours of middle-click, except some were undocumented:\n\n\n*\n\n*middle-click on the title bar will cause the window to be sent behind other windows;\n\n*middle-click on the window control buttons (close, minimize, maximize) will activate corresponding behaviours (close the window, minimize the window, maximize vertically).\nThere may be additional behaviours when doing a middle-click on the target window, such as window with clickable objects or editable fields or text area.\n\n\n*\n\n*If the window has editable text area, middle-click will position the cursor \"as it is\", such that cursor does not move and;\n\n*the middle-click will paste the content, if the clipboard of primary selection is not empty.\nA middle-click will paste nothing, if the clipboard of primary selection is empty. This is the default state when everytime user logs into the Ubuntu Desktop.\nWhen user invokes column selection, which is \"click on primary button on mouse, drag cursor on some text then release click\", the selected text will be copied to PRIMARY. As a result, middle-click will give focus and raise the window, then paste the content into any text area.\nWorkaround for unwanted paste\nTo avoid the unwanted paste, clear the clipboard of primary selection before doing a middle-click. One way is to install xclip and run this nullifying command:\n\nxclip -i /dev/null\n\nThen a middle-click will paste nothing; run xclip -o and confirm the output in terminal.\nThe nullifying command may be assigned to a custom keyboard shortcut such as using any Fn-key for \"on demand\" method. Otherwise, the command may be set to run at every few seconds by a scheduler for \"setup once then forget\" method.\nEven without any workaround, the clipboard of primary selection will be discarded automatically when closing/exiting the corresponding window, from which text selection has been made. If using an external clipboard manager, make sure the clipboard of primary selection is disabled.\nTested behaviour and workaround in Ubuntu 16.04 (Unity 7.4.0).\nTL;DR A middle-click can give focus and raise the window above other windows, without registering the click. Empty the clipboard of primary selection to nullify paste on middle-click.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 16.04 Installer Crashes Shortly After Partitioning Disk I am trying to dual-boot Windows 10 Home and Ubuntu 16.04 LTS on a Lenovo G50-70 laptop. The computer used to have Windows 8.1 and Ubuntu 14.04 LTS installed as a dual-boot with EFI. I want to do a clean install/upgrade of both operating systems with the same partition scheme as before, except a bigger Ubuntu root partition. \n\nI have already installed Windows 10 by formatting the partition that had Windows 8 (/dev/sda4) and then installing Windows 10 onto that partition. Windows 10 works fine, and so did Ubuntu 14.04.\nThen in Windows 10, I copied all the files from the ubuntu-16.04-desktop-amd64.iso into an EFI bootable USB drive, just as I did when I installed Ubuntu 14.04 back then and Windows 10 just now. \nWhen I booted from the USB drive, I selected \"Install Ubuntu\" from the menu and continued on to the \"Installation Type,\" where I chose \"Something else.\" At the partitions screen, I chose the mount point for /dev/sda6 as /boot, /dev/sda8 as /, and /dev/sda9 as /home. This was how I had it working for Ubuntu 14.04. I chose to format /dev/sda6-9 and the first time I resized /dev/sda8 to ~32GB and as a result reduced the size of /dev/sda9. For the boot device, I chose /dev/sda6.\nWhen I click Install Now, it takes me to the Location screen, but a few seconds later it will say the installer has crashed:\nWhen I try to report the error, it loads a live session of Ubuntu and shows this error:\n\nThe problem cannot be reported:\nE:Malformed entry 2 in list file /etc/apt/sources.list (absolute Suite >Component), E:The list of sources could not be read.\n\nHere are the contents of the file /etc/apt/sources.list:\ndeb cdrom:[Ubuntu 16.04 LTS _Xenial Xerus_ - Release amd64 (20160420.1)]/ xenial main restricted\ndeb cdrom:[Ubuntu 16.04 LTS _Xenial Xerus_ - Release amd64 (20160420.1)]/Ubuntu 14.04/ trusty main trusty restricted\ndeb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ xenial main restricted\ndeb http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ xenial-security main restricted\ndeb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ xenial-updates main restricted\n\nI have tried many other things but the installer still crashes:\n\n\n*\n\n*not making a /boot partition\n\n*selecting the Windows Boot Manager partition for the boot device\n\n*selecting the hard drive as the boot device (no specific partition)\n\n*Trying Ubuntu before installing (Ubuntu works perfectly in a live session)\n\n*Unselecting \"Download updates while Ubuntu is installing\" and \"Install third part software\"\n\n*deleting all the Ubuntu partitions and creating them again\n\n*burning the ISO to a DVD and installing from the DVD\n\n*downloading the ISO from a torrent and loading it on the USB drive\n\n*installing while not connected to the internet\n\n*Checking the DVD and USB drive for defects from boot menu\n\n\nOther things I have done:\n\n\n*\n\n*disabled Secure Boot and Fast Startup in the BIOS\n\n*checked the md5sum of the ISO files I downloaded and they do match with those provided on Ubuntu's website.\n\n\nAny ideas how to fix this installer crashing problem? Thanks!\n\nA: I had this issue too. It was because I was using version of the USB Startup Disk creator that was very old, I think it was on Ubuntu 14.10. I got around the problem by booting the USB into a live session of 16.04, redownloading the 16.04 .iso image, and making a new USB Startup Disk using the updated tool in the live session. Then I rebooted onto the new disk and the installation went without a hitch. \n", "Q: alt-tab for IR remote Is there a way to set up a key combination that brings up the Alt+Tab interface and leaves it up after releasing the keys, allowing to navigate between open windows with arrow keys and selecting them with the enter key?\nI have a media pc set up with Kodi and steam, I would like to be able to alt-tab via a remote control so, I do not need a keyboard plugged in, but the normal Alt+Tab interface requires you to keep holding down alt to keep it up. this does not work with an IR remote.\nI am able to bind any key combination I want to the IR remote using a FLIRC which is a USB IR receiver that emulates an HID device.\n\nA: You can install Compiz using these commands:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install compiz compiz-plugins-extra\n\nAfter installing compiz open dash and type ccsm.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open compiz.\n\n*In compiz window management enable shift Switcher.\n\n*Assign initiate key (All Workspaces).\n\n*grab any key you want.\n\n\n\n", "Q: Jar files in the Ubuntu Hud So I have a few jar files that I frequently use (Minecraft and other launchers, to name a few) and they show up under the \"File and Folders\" section.  If I open other files that have a similar file path, those ones may get farther down in the list whenever I search for the file through the Hud.  \nIs there any way to have them treated as applications, so that they show up in that section of the Hud, and then their priority gets increased every time I open them?\n\nA: In fact jar is not an application.  It can be treated like pdf or docx or smth like that.  In detail, jar is just a set of compiled java classes and some meta information packed into zip archive with jar extension.\nCan't say if there is any native way, but try to create a shell script launcher, I guess it should be treated as \"normal\" executable.\n", "Q: Prevent vlan and bridge interface rename to renameX form Ubuntu 16.04 server.  Almost all vlan and bridge interfaces are renamed to the form renameX. How to prevent, or control the way interfaces are renamed?\nI know that this is done by systemd, I know how to control for a physical interface, but unable to find the way to fix this problem for the logical interfaces.\n\nA: I have just run into this problem on OVH cloud instance using Ubuntu 16.04 as well.

On systemd handles the \"Predicatable Network Interface Names\" you can readup here: https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/PredictableNetworkInterfaceNames/ .\nTo prevent vlan interfaces from being renamed I created /etc/systemd/network/10-vlan.link, here is the contents of it:\n[Match]\nDriver=*802.1Q*\n[Link]\nNamePolicy=kernel\n\nHere is more about this (with examples): https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.link.html \nFor it to change NamePolicy for bridge interfaces as well it will require expanding the Driver in Match section, like so:\n[Match]\nDriver=*802.1Q* bridge\n[Link]\nNamePolicy=kernel\n\nbut keep in mind I have not tested it with bridge interfaces, so no guarantees here.\n\nA: I found the driver was different in my server but this worked nicely for me, retaining the original eth names:\n[Match]\nOriginalName=eth*\n[Link]\nNamePolicy=kernel\n\n", "Q: Need bash script output on one line - curl and >> produces 2 lines I am running this bash script:\n#!/bin/sh\ndate +\"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S \" | tr -d 'n' >> /home/test_a5gh/Pub_IP.txt\ncurl http://checkip.amazonaws.com?newline -s >> /home/test_a5gh/Pub_IP.txt\ncat /home/test_a5gh/Pub_IP.txt\n\nAfter creating the above file, I placed it in the folder /home/test_a5gh/ and then I made the script executable:\n$ sudo chmod u+x testip.sh\n\nNext, to test the script, I ran:\n$ ./testip.sh\n\nHowever, the output of this command is being produced on 2 lines.

Ever since the upgrade I am having problems playing video files in VLC and Kodi. Totem works fine.\nThe video will start playing but fairly quickly stops and freezes the entire system. Power cycling the machine seems to be the only way to get it back up and running again. \nInitially I assumed something had gone wrong in the upgrade process, but after experiencing the exact same issue when running xubuntu 16.04 directly from dvd I suspect there most be a driver issue of some sort.

After updating, I need to restart/reboot, I did it and it was shown the grub2 menu. I choose Ubuntu. But I don't really know if Ubutu succeded in restarting Ubuntu because I suspected grub2 may be preventing Ubuntu from restarting. It's just a ignorant doubt, please don't downvote me, if you think the question is fair to close, please answer but at least give me a positive answer if this is the correct procedure for restarting the Ubuntu.\n\nA: GRUB is the bootloader.

This doesn't cause problems of any kind normally, however, I don't have mouse or keyboard attached to my computer, instead I control my PC remotely using Unified Remote.\nAnd my problem is that although the remote controlling works, I cannot see where my cursor is because it remains invisible as Ubuntu doesn't seem to consider my remotely manipulated cursor as mouse movements, so it never shows the cursor.\nThe fix would be a simple command that would run immediately after startup and its task would be merely to make the cursor visible so I can see it when moving it remotely.

Any help is much appreciated.\n\nA: In Ubuntu, the default SSH policy is \"Deny root login via SSH directly, except by SSH Key Authentication only.\"  This is done by the PermitRootLogin without-password line of /etc/ssh/sshd_config.\nYou can enable root password login over SSH by changing that line to say PermitRootLogin yes.  However I must caution you - this permits brute forcing attempts over the Internet of the root password which puts your server at risk - you may wish to consider blocking all SSH traffic except from known \"good IP sources\" of which you trust the source IPs in order to reduce the chance of being brute-forced on the root login.  Where this is not possible, you should strongly consider setting up SSH key authentication for the root account instead of password authentication.\n", "Q: Why are memory statistics in top and htop different? Whenever I use top and htop commands to see memory stats, they are always different as shown in figures.

Everything should work out of the box.\nAlthough, take note that you may have some issues.\nIt is not too uncommon to have issues with Wi-Fi, and your life is practically over if you have Nvidia Optimus. (The optimus part doesn't apply to you I think, since at least from what I could find you have integrated AMD graphics)\nI wasn't able to do any research on the Wi-Fi, since the official \"spec sheet\" is EXTREMELY vague.\nJust burn the 16.04 ISO to a blank DVD, and try it in live mode to check if everything works.\n\nI recommend burning to a DVD ^^^ rather than onto a USB drive since for some reason new users always have problems successfully burning a USB stick.\nIf you don't have a blank DVD, and want to try a USB stick, I recommend this program, because it has the highest success rate: http://www.pendrivelinux.com/universal-usb-installer-easy-as-1-2-3/\n\nA: While Android Dev made a great answer, I want to add a few things.\nFirst, I'm going to start out with a bit of a tip. We're here to answer your questions, but we generally don't like having to research your computer to get its specs. People have different variations of the same model, or even custom models, and it can be tricky trying to figure out how to help when there are, say, 5 different possible network cards. With that said, I do appreciate you at least giving the model of the laptop. There are many people who come here to ask who don't give any specifics at all.\nNow for an answer.\nEven with your model number, I had trouble finding very detailed specs online (even though the PDF I opened from Toshiba said \"Detailed Specs\"). However, I was able to see that your computer has AMD graphics. With the release of Ubuntu 16.04, AMD cards no longer have proprietary drivers available. The end result of that is usually a huge lack of performance.\nIf you need to game or watch a lot of videos, I suggest you install Ubuntu 14.04 instead of 16.04. 14.04 still has drivers for AMD cards that will give you good performance. You cannot install fglrx (the AMD proprietary driver) on Ubuntu 16.04. It will break your installation.\nSince I couldn't find any other specs on your model, I have to assume and say everything should work. You should only worry if your Wi-Fi card is a certain Broadcom series or a Realtek. Both have relatively easy fixes, but they are a hassle to set up.\nOther than graphics and network, you shouldn't have to worry.\n", "Q: Is there a CLI software center that supports reviews and ratings?

I previously was able to connect with this same modem to BSNL broadband automatically.\n\nA: Mark that bookmarked page as your homepage, and set your browser to remember username and password. This way, the browser will automatically load your credentials every time you open it. Then set yet another homepage with your favourite search engine (Google, Yahoo, Yandex, etc), so the browser will open 2 homepages in two different tabs every time you open 'the internet'.  \nYou should check your router settings: type the router address in a browser, and check out those settings. I'm sure you can store ISP name and password there.

So how can I fully remove the version that I installed? I am running Ubuntu GNOME 16.04 with GNOME 3.20.\n\nA: You will need to delete the files unpacked from the tar archive into $HOME. They'll probably be in a single directory, though that depends on how Dropbox made the tar file. Either way, they'll all be in your $HOME directory.\nHowever, executing the daemon may have created some config files or other odds and ends.

If it does, you won't need to reformat and use Unetbootin to re-create the live environment.\nWhat I did was:\n\n\n*\n\n*Reformat the drive using the 'Disks' app (choose 'Format Disk' / CTRL+F from the hamburger menu)\n\n*Create a 2GB FAT32 partition and mount it (again using the 'Disks' app)\n\n*Create all other partitions on the remaining space (in my case, a single 2GB LUKS encrypted EXT4 partition)\n\n*Install Unetbootin and use it to re-create the Live environment on the 2GB FAT32 partition\n\n*Set the FAT32 partition to 'bootable' using the 'Disks' app.\n(*) - Actually, the steps above are IMHO workarounds to bugs in both 'Startup Disk Creator' (which used a faulty block size) and Unetbootin (which failed to set the partition to 'bootable').\n", "Q: USB flash drive stuck in RO after DDing ISO After I used dd to make a USB drive from an Ubuntu ISO, I am unable to format it for normal use.\nI ran:\nsudo dd if=\"ubuntu-16.04-desktop-amd64.iso\" of=\"/dev/sdb\" bs=4M\n\nIn order to create a bootable USB drive.\nHowever, after I was done with it, I wanted to format it as FAT32 and use it like a normal USB drive.\nNo problem, should be easy, right? WRONG.\nI have tried:\n\n*\n\n*Using the included Disks application to format it. It threw an error about corrupt GPT tables and wouldn't give me an override option.\n\n*Using Gparted the erase the current partition table and write a new MBR table [completed successfully]\n\n*After that I created a FAT32 partition spanning the entire volume, and remounted.

[Same RO error when attempting to copy a file onto it]\n\n*Repeated the procedure trying this time with EXT4 [Same RO error]\n\n*Repeated procedure trying a GTP table instead of an MBR table. {Same error]\n\nFinally, I tried running:\nsudo hdparm -r0 /dev/sdb\n\nAnd remounted. Still the same error. Keep in mind that I remounted it after formatting it each time.\nI am at a total loss.

In fact, it is quite boring.\nIs there any way to force terminal run this magical words automatically? So if I type CtrlShiftT in terminal, and in current tab virtualenv is ran, terminal should open the very same virtualenv in the fresh new tab.\nOr may be something completely different to solve this problem.\n\nA: Targeting specific terminal emulators\nAutomatically running a command on creation of a new terminal tab would be a feature of the specific terminal you are using, and not related to python or virtualenv. \nTo have a broader range or answers the question would probably have to be How to autorun a shell command for terminal emulator xyz. For example, for gnome-terminal you can use custom profiles as described in https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/3856/15312, but this is an unportable solution if you decide to switch to another terminal or platform.\nOn the other hand, nobody wants to get locked to a specific terminal app, therefore the next option would be a more portable approach.\nTargeting shell init scripts\nIf you control the shell that is running in the tab, then you can do it in your shell init script. \nFor example, for bash you can add the following lines in your ~/.bashrc script:\nif [[ -f .venv/bin/activate ]] ; then\n    source .venv/bin/activate\nfi \n\n\nFor zsh add the snippet to ~/.zshrc.\n\nWhenever you create a new shell or open a new tab this snippet will check if you have a .venv folder in the current path and activate that venv automatically. If you create your virtualenvs in a folder which is not named .venv then adjust the script accordingly.\nYou might also want to override cd so that whenever you cd into a venv it will be automatically activated:\nBelow is an example for zsh:\nfunction cd() {\n  builtin cd $1\n\n  if [[ -f .venv/bin/activate ]] ; then\n    source .venv/bin/activate\n  fi\n}\n\nReduce typing with virtualenvwrapper\nSpecifically regarding virtualenv: you might want to try virtualenvwrapper which can help reduce the amount of typing, and make managing environments easier by providing autocompletion for virtualenv folders.\nBackgrounding processes\nAnd finally, as a quick workaround, instead of creating new tabs with the same env, you can suspend a currently running process (such as manage.py runserver) with Ctr+z, optionally run bg to resume it in background if you want to keep it running, then edit and save a file, and bring the original process back to foreground with fg. See this for more details.\n\nA: I am using conda for virtual environments, and I felt the same need as your question. So I wrote a simple shell script for myself.

Basically, anything that can be shared that won't create problems by being shared between the operating systems.  I would like this to be a completely separate disk (physically) where the OSs will be installed.\n\n\nNote: The reason I am doing this is because each OS is going to have different tools to work on the same data.  Unfortunately, many tools I need are simply not compatible with 16.04 yet (and might never be), and I don't have the time to try to hack everything into 16.04 if the normal setup fails.\nI have googled this problem quite a bit and either the answer is really old (don't know if the answer is still valid or not), or it assumes I want/have a Windows boot as well, or the steps simply don't seem to have enough detail so I can follow them step-by-step (how to manually partition a disk to perform an installation is somewhat confusing to me).  I found this blog article on sharing data between distros without sharing the things that you want to keep separate.\nhttp://www.linuxtoday.com/blog/2009/08/painless-linux.htmlPainless Linux Multi-boot\nI'm pretty sure I can do the steps in this article without much difficulty, and I'm going to assume this blog article describes a good way to share data between Ubuntu distros.  If you know of a better solution or why this is a bad one please share.  I'm not emotionally attached to any particular solution at the moment and don't have any constraints on the solution either, but I need to start the discussion somewhere.  Unfortunately, this article doesn't completely explain the issue I am working on, but I feel it is going in the right direction.\nI want to install Ubuntu 14.04, 15.10, 16.04 (desktop versions) on one machine and no Windows installations.  I'm assuming I should install them all on the same disk (which is a 250GB SSD), then use a separate disk for sharing/storing data as described in the linked blog article.  Although, I have plenty of disks available if each OS should preferably have its own separate disk.\nAnyhow, if anyone knows of a tutorial that will fill in the gaps in doing this please share it.  I would prefer a link to a step-by-step tutorial so I can learn from it and save it for later.\n\nA: *\n\n*No problem.\n\n*That is normal when you have 2 or more operating systems.\n\n*Pretty simple. Assume you have an empty disk and boot into the installation and are at the partitioning setup.\n\n\n*\n\n*create 4 partitions. Ubuntu OS needs a root of about 25Gb that can include a /home/. 25Gb is more than enough if you keep your own data outside of the system (ie. out of / and out of /home).\n\n*mount the 1st of those 4 as / \n\n*mount the bottom one as /data/ or whatever name you want. Make it ext4.\n\n*install system 1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*when done install system 2.\n\n*mount the 2nd partition as /\n\n*mount the bottom one as /data/ -without- formatting.\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*when done install system 3\n\n*mount the 3rd partition as /\n\n*mount the bottom one as /data/ -without- formatting.\n\n\n\nSome extras:\n\n\n*\n\n*Try to avoid sharing /home/.* and just stick to the subdirectories. This will avoid any kind of conflict between releases.\n\n*if you want you can expand each of these with a boot. \n\n*Opt for adding a partition for /opt. If you install 3rd party software that is the most ideal directory to use and there is a good chance you can then use the software on all 3.\n\n*use the same usernames and userIDs on all systems.\n\n*copy from 1 system all the directories in /home/ to /data/. \n\n*When done remove all the -directories- in each of the /home/'s and edit .config/user-dirs.dirs in each of the systems to point to /data/. \n\n\nAnd you are done.\nI do believe though there is an easier method nowadays.\n\n\n*\n\n*Install 16.04 as explained at the 1st part with a /data/ disk. It is the latest LTS so has a long support.\n\n*Install virtualBox or VM Ware. Install 2 systems into that.\n\n*Install guestadditions for VBOX or WM Ware tools for VM Ware and mount the /data/ in the 2 systems.\n\n\nBig plus for this: you can start all 3 systems at the same time. No picking a system at boot time. Adding more other operating systems is a lot easier an removing a system it also a lot easier. Backup means creating a copy of your container. And you can even multiply containers. \n\nA: I suggest you first install Ubuntu 14.04 and during installation make 3 partitions of 250gb ssd each disk formatted as ext4 and mount one partition as / , also format the other disk where you want to save data as /home . Then install Ubuntu 15.04 in the second partition of 250gb ssd and format it as ext4 and mount it as / and mount the other disk where you want to save data which is home for Ubuntu 14.04 as /home (no need to format it). Similarly install Ubuntu 16.04 on the third partition of 250gb ssd and mount it as / and mount the other disk which is used as home for other 2 Ubuntus as /home.\nThis way your home is mounted on other disk and data in that disk is shared among all Ubuntus. I have earlier used the same approach to share one home directory with Ubuntu and fedora. It will work fine.\nNote: Keep username for all Ubuntu the same. You need to install grub and make sure it detects all OSes \n\nA: While you can do this, it may be more convenient to use chroot jails to hold your multiple installations of Ubuntu.  This has a downside that you will need to use the same kernel for all of your installations, but the upside is that you can use them at the same time, without needing to reboot, and don't need to partition your disks for the individual installations.\nThere are full instructions on the Ubuntu wiki.\n", "Q: Unable to update on Ubuntu 16.04 on a Raspberry Pi 3 Running sudo apt-get update in Ubuntu 16.04 on a Raspberry Pi 3, gives me the error:\nHit:1 http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu xenial InRelease\nHit:2 http://ppa.launchpad.net/ubuntu-raspi2/ppa-rpi3/ubuntu xenial InRelease                       \nHit:3 http://ports.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-ports xenial InRelease                                        \nHit:4 http://ppa.launchpad.net/ubuntu-raspi2/ppa/ubuntu xenial InRelease\nHit:5 http://ports.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-ports xenial-updates InRelease\nHit:6 http://ports.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-ports xenial-backports InRelease\nHit:7 http://ports.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-ports xenial-security InRelease\nErr:6 http://ports.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-ports xenial-backports InReleaseuntu.com_ubuntu-ports_dists_xenial-backports_InRelease into data and signature failed\n  Clearsigned file isn't valid, got 'NODATA' (does the network require authentication?)\nReading package lists...

Is it possible that shutting down and then unplugging my external hard drive could have broken a path?\nI have Ubuntu 16.04 and a WD Elements 10A8 1TB external HDD. The HD worked fine on Ubuntu and Windows but now it does not show up in Nautilus Files and it shows up in Disks as an Unknown partition and won't let me mount it. In Windows when I try open the HD the message reads F:\\ is not accessible. The disk structure is corrupted and unreadable. This makes me think that perhaps the HD has been bricked by not safely unmounting before removing.

If you have important data on that disk get a new disk and take an image of the original disk using dd or dd-rescue.\nDo not try to recover data before you got that image, as the recovery atempt might destroy your data. Get help from your local linux user group, if you are not shure what to do, but do that disk image first.\nAfter that you can try to recover your data, use fdisk/gdisk to check the partitioning and fsck your filesystem.\n", "Q: Does Nautilus exclude any items from its search results?

I love the idea behind snap and played with it on a Ubuntu VM.\n\nSnapcraft Overview\nSnapcraft is a build and packaging tool which helps you package your\n  software as a snap. It makes it easy to incorporate components from\n  different sources and build technologies or solutions. Key concepts\nA .snap package for the Ubuntu Core system contains all its\n  dependencies. This has a couple of advantages over traditional deb or\n  rpm based dependency handling, the most important being that a\n  developer can always be assured that there are no regressions\n  triggered by changes to the system underneath their app.\nSnapcraft makes bundling these dependencies easy by allowing you to\n  specify them as \"parts\" in the snapcraft.yaml file. Snappy\nSnappy Ubuntu Core is a new rendition of Ubuntu with transactional\n  updates - a minimal server image with the same libraries as today's\n  Ubuntu, but applications are provided through a simpler mechanism.\nSnappy apps and Ubuntu Core itself can be upgraded atomically and\n  rolled back if needed. Apps are also strictly confined and sandboxed\n  to safeguard your data and system.\n\nIoT ›Build apps\nOn what technologies is snap based? How do the architecture and toolkits look? Does snap depend on Linux kernel features?\nI ask, because I'm wondering whether in the future I'll be able to use the same snap packages also on macOS?\nClarification, after first comment:\nI know that macOS and Ubuntu are not binary compatible. A recompile is needed. There is almost any Open Source available already for macOS with Homebrew. The developer could develop on macOS and deploy on Ubuntu when snap will be (in future) available for macOS.\n\nA: Yes, thanks to the stability of the Linux syscall interface, this is possible.\nOne of Linus Torvalds' great commitments to Linux users is that the set of interfaces offered by the kernel is stable. Many people don't appreciate the value of this, or how challenging it is as a leader of an open project to achieve that commitment. Consider for example how unpredictable changes in the GNOME APIs are by contrast! When you hear about Linus getting intense on a mailing list, it's almost always because some committer to the kernel decided to change such an interface 'because they had a better idea'. Linus says you can innovate wildly INSIDE the kernel, but please don't break the 'userspace' apps which depend on existing syscalls.\nAs a consequence of that stability it is possible for other kernels to offer the same syscalls, allowing apps built on Linux to run on those other kernels.\nOne example of that is the Joyent Triton project, which offer Linux-compatible syscalls in containers on SmartOS (a descendent of IllumOS, a descendent of Solaris).\nA more widely known example is the new Linux subsystem in Windows.\nOf course, how many of the syscalls are offered, and how bug-for-bug compatible they are, is the real question. At least for now, there is not another environment where all the necessary syscalls are in place, because the ones snaps use are relatively new and deep in the way the kernel thinks about the things it manages.\nBut they will certainnly come, in time, and I think snaps will thus be usable in a wide range of contexts.\nWhich is very cool, patches welcome :)\n\nA: While I can't find any information about macOS, this OMG! Ubuntu article has an interesting quote from Mark Shuttleworth:\n\nAs for running Snaps on Windows 10? “It’s absolutely plausible”\n  Shuttleworth said.\n“Snaps are using modern features in the Linux kernel to do security\n  confinement, set up file system access, etc, and all of that involves\n  using modern mechanisms in the kernel. And Canonical lead a lot of\n  [this work]. It’ll take a while for Microsoft to [get to hook in to\n  it].”\n\nIf it's \"plausible\" to get it running in Windows, I'd say the same for macOS, except that Microsoft seems to be cooperating with Canonical, which is not something I have heard about Apple doing.\n\nThe documentation on Snap security policy and sandboxing and the Arch Wiki entry on snapd are informative:\nFrom the Arch Wiki:\n\nNote that snap-confine is built with the --disable-confinement option;\n  full confinement relies on an AppArmor enabled kernel and related\n  profile for the snap.\n\nFrom the policy:\n\nUnder the hood, the launcher:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Sets up various environment variables: […] \n  \n*When hardware is assigned to the snap, sets up a device cgroup with default   devices (eg, /dev/null, /dev/urandom, etc) and any devices\n  that are assigned   to this snap\n  \n*Sets up a private /tmp using a per-command private mount namespace and   mounting a per-command directory on /tmp\n  \n*Sets up a per-command devpts new instance\n  \n*Sets up the seccomp filter for the command\n  \n*Executes the command under the command-specific AppArmor profile under a   default nice value\n  \n  \n  This combination of restrictive AppArmor profiles (which mediate file\n  access, application execution, Linux capabilities(7), mount, ptrace,\n  IPC, signals, coarse-grained networking), clearly defined\n  application-specific filesystem areas, whitelist syscall filtering via\n  seccomp, private /tmp, new instance devpts and device cgroups provides\n  for strong application confinement and isolation.\n\nWhile AppArmor and seccomp are Linux only, it looks like confinement can be made optional, so we can ignore that. Then there's usage of devpts, cgroups and mount namespaces. If there's any blocking, I think it would be for those. I'm not familiar enough with the BSDs to say what the equivalents are.\nThe snapd application itself is written in Go, which should make it reasonably cross-platform. Indeed, some files have very interesting build targets:\nosutil/group_other.go:\n// -*- Mode: Go; indent-tabs-mode: t -*-\n// +build !linux,!darwin,!freebsd\n\nosutil/group_linux.go:\n// -*- Mode: Go; indent-tabs-mode: t -*-\n// +build darwin freebsd linux\n// +build cgo\n\nSo it looks like someone has an interest in this.\n\nA: As of today, snap can be installed on MacOS but cannot be used.\n$ brew install snap\n$ snap install ./some-app.snap --devmode\nInteracting with snapd is not yet supported on darwin.\nThis command has been left available for documentation purposes only.\n\n", "Q: Created a dual boot but only boots to Ubuntu A friend of mine had installed Ubuntu 16.04 using the \"Alongside Windows 8\" option and now the system only boots to Ubuntu.\nHow can we fix this?\n\nA: If you get GRUB bootloader but it doesn't show windows 8 try to update grub.

Then I did a do-release-upgrade from Kubuntu 12.04 to 14.04, which downgraded Xournal to version 0.4.7.  (Edit: Actually this is technically false; see my answer.) So after re-enabling the ppa (and updating), I replaced the stock Xournal (from the ppa) with my modified version again, and shortly thereafter a routine sudo aptitude update && sudo aptitude safe-upgrade produced \nThe following packages will be updated:\nxournal\n\nOf course sudo aptitude hold xournal prevents this unwanted \"update\" from occurring (although there is still always an \"updates available\" icon in the notification area that I don't know how to get rid of), but I would like to know the reason for this change in behavior.\n\nA: Turns out this is actually the expected behavior, since the version number of Xournal is now 4.8 instead of 0.4.8 (due to some sort of clerical error, I guess?), as pointed out here.  This is also why 0.4.8 was \"upgraded\" to 4.7.  \nPreventing the unwanted \"update\" may be accomplished by \"holding\" the package, to wit:\nsudo aptitude hold xournal\n\n--at least if one uses aptitude for software updates, as I do.  But since the update notification icon in the system tray is generated by Muon Update Notifier, in order to eliminate that it is necessary to mark the package as held also in Muon Package Manager.

Additionally my asus monitor has a box that says \"out of range\" whenever I tried to run Ubuntu with the black screen. When I ran ubuntu it would be the black screen with the box that says \"out of range\", but I could still hear it going to the login screen.\nI erased my SSD and reinstalled windows with the nvidia drivers and now when I try to install ubuntu it loads up from my usb, and it turns black once at the install screen. I have never had this problem until I got the GTX 1070. Does anyone know how to fix this?\n\nA: There is a compiled driver that already supports GTX 1070, which is 367.\nI didn't know about the nomodeset command,so what I did is just use my integrated graphics to boot up into Ubuntu and install the latest driver that supports GTX 1070 (which is 367) from the graphics-driver PPA. Do not install the latest driver from the Nvidia's website because it won't install the 32 bit drivers and causes some application fails to start, such as Steam.\nAfter you booted up into Ubuntu using your integrated graphics or using the nomodeset, install the drivers from PPA:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:graphics-drivers/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-367\n\nand after that reboot your machine, now you can start using your GTX 1070/1080.

If the problems occur before login it is more than likely related to the video card driver.\n1st thing to do is to go to a TTY (control alt f1). You can use apt-get to re-install ubuntu with:\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop\n\n(or any other desktop) or re-install your video card driver or re-configure your video card.\nIf that is not possible you can also do this from the grub prompt or from a live session.\nAs a future method of doing this: do not mess with your OS.

If not, is it possible to update the newer packages somehow?\n\nA: No package will typically be updated beyond the major version shipped with the initial release of the distribution. Minor updates may be released provided changes are not significant, and security fixes from newer versions may be back-ported to maintain compatibility.\nYou will find that some packages independently offer newer major versions from their own repos, but that's at their discretion and those packages wouldn't be supported by Canonical.\n", "Q: Corel Aftershot Pro 3 not starting in 16.04 The icon to start Corel Aftershot Pro 3 in Xenial Xerus doesn't start the Aftershot interface. \nWhen you start the shellscript /usr/bin/AfterShot3X64 from a terminal, you see error while loading shared libraries: libgstreamer-0.10.so.0.\nThe full output is as follows.\nInstall Path:           /opt/AfterShot3(64-bit)\nLD_PATH:                /opt/AfterShot3(64-bit)/lib:\nXLIB_SKIP_ARGB_VISUALS:\n./AfterShot: error while loading shared libraries: libgstreamer-0.10.so.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory\ngunang@waney-ubuntu:~$ /usr/bin/AfterShot3X64\nInstall Path:           /opt/AfterShot3(64-bit)\nLD_PATH:                /opt/AfterShot3(64-bit)/lib:\nXLIB_SKIP_ARGB_VISUALS:\n./AfterShot: error while loading shared libraries: libgstreamer-0.10.so.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory\n\n\nA: The Corel  application needs libgstreamer-0.10.so to start.\nInstall that library.\nsudo apt-get install libgstreamer0.10-0\n\n", "Q: How do I remove grub?

I had opened port 22 in both the endpoints and tried the ssh command. I got a \"no route to host\" message. May I know how to diagnose this?\n\nA: It depends on how you have set up networking in Virtualbox between the host and the guest. The two most common set-ups are NAT or Bridged.\nIn the NAT (Network Address Translation) case you will have to set up port forwarding to access the guest from your host. AFAIK, this is the default for Virtualbox and you will likely be using that if you have not changed the network settings when you creted the VM (Virtual Machine). \nSetting up Port Forwarding is not difficult, but how it works is more difficult to understand than using Bridged. In NAT mode, the guest uses the IP address of the host.\nThe easiest is to use Bridged. You have to set this up when the virtual machine is turned off. Go to the Network tab in Virtualbox for the VM and set the Attached to: field to 'Bridged Adapter' and start the VM.  \nIn Bridged mode the VM gets its own IP address on your network (via DHCP). \nAfter the VM has started, log in and give the command ifconfig in a terminal window. This should give you the IP address of the guest machine.\nYou can then SSH from your host to the guest: ssh <username>@<guest IP>. \nAlternatively, after the VM has started, log in give the command hostname in a terminal window. This should give you the hostname of the guest machine.\nYou can then SSH from your host to the guest: ssh <username>@<hostname>.\nYou can omit username@ if you want to ssh using the same username as on your host.\n", "Q: Accidentally deleted Ubuntu volume from Windows?

Why is this so big.  I only have 12 or so gigs for my system and this wipes me out with 450mb left over.  Is there a setting I can change to make this smaller?\n\n*Can I safely move this to an sd?  (I am sure it will take ages to copy too)\n\n\nA: An Audacity 'project' has a file structure as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*An *.aup Project File which is a simple xml file used as a reference file, thus not a big file in itself.\n\n*A *_data folder containing many, many small .au files which are segments of the working file stored in uncompressed, lossless format = the large file sizes that you have experienced.\n\n\nStoring in a lossless format does give big file sizes but means that Audacity can:\n\n\n*\n\n*Work on the individual files better: adding filters, adjusting volume and performing all of other Audacity magic\n\n*Subsequently export to multiple different formats in high quality, retaining the original high quality, lossless files for further work\n\n\nThus you are stuck with the big size of the working files.\nAs regards your other issue of moving these lossless files your best advice from the Audacity documentation is to strictly avoid moving these project files manually.\nHowever you can backup your project safely to your sd drive by using the Save Project As.. option in Audacity and directing the output to your backup media. This is a safe option that you should investigate...\n", "Q: conflict between guake and ubuntu mate I have installed Xubuntu 16.04. Then I gave a try to use Ubuntu Mate, installed appropriate packages for it. After installation, I logged out and logged in again with Mate session. Everything was fine until I launched Guake terminal. It warned me to change activation key to other than F12. On the other hand, when I activate (or open) Guake, the bottom bar of it was missing.\nHow can I fix it? \n\nA: Sorry for disturbing. It was \"tilda\", another dropdown terminal app, which was conflicting with guake. When I hit \"preferences\" on right-click menu, preferences of tilda were shown. At this time, guake hadn't launched. I have recognized the \"conflict of conflict\" after I asked the question above.\nSorry again!\n", "Q: /etc/dpkg/dpkg.cfg.d/multiarch: Permission denied I have Ubuntu 14.04, and I'm trying to install wine:i386 to use PlayOnLinux, following this article. However, when I run:\nsudo echo \"foreign-i386 architecture\"> /etc/dpkg/dpkg.cfg.d/multiarch\nI get this error /etc/dpkg/dpkg.cfg.d/multiarch: Permission denied\nBeing still new to Ubuntu I don't know how safe it is (or advisable) to manually change permissions to overcome this. What should I do to solve this?\nEDIT\nThe main objective of this question is to install Wine, not the syntax itself (although the syntax was the problem), the accepted answer provided a better way of solving this.\n\nA: You have two problems:\n\n\n*\n\n*/etc/dpkg/dpkg.cfg.d/multiarch file is being opened by the shell as unprivileged user before the echo command runs, hence the permission error as only root should be able to create the file or write in it. The sudo is only being applied to echo command.\n\n*The string foreign-i386 architecture is not correct for enabling multiarch support for i386 architecture, the correct string is foreign-architecture i386.\nTo fix these, you can do:\nsudo bash -c 'echo \"foreign-architecture i386\" >>/etc/dpkg/dpkg.cfg.d/multiarch'\n\nOr\necho \"foreign-architecture i386\" | sudo tee -a /etc/dpkg/dpkg.cfg.d/multiarch\n\n\nNote that, the easiest way to enable multiarch and add i386 architecture would be:\nsudo dpkg --add-architecture i386\n\n\nDon't forget to run sudo apt-get update after enabling multiarch.\n", "Q: Why does katoolin break my Ubuntu 16.04 instalation? I am running a fresh install of Ubuntu 16.04, after breaking it for the fifth time and reinstalling it for the sixth. I tried to install select Kali tools using Katoolin using these instructions: http://www.tecmint.com/install-kali-linux-tools-using-katoolin-on-ubuntu-debian/\nWhen I was done installing, I would reboot and then start classicmenu indicator to set it up and get rid of any duplicate menu items, etc. Then I would use my laptop as normal (Acer Chromebook CB3-111-C8UB). After the second boot up at another time, the login screen would appear as normal and then when I log in, nothing happens. The log in screen just disappears. not even the wallpaper has changed though, so the password prompt and pretty much anything that was interactive on screen just faded away. I did hours of research and all of these symptoms led me to believe that this is a screen driver issue. I followed numerous guides to installing the correct drivers or whatever i need to install and clean and reinstall, even reinstalling unity and trying to install xfce. I have access to tty and all other things are working as far as I know (wifi and keyboard at least), but when I log into tty it gives Kali/GNU or whatever disclaimer. The reason I do not want to simply install Kali is because the desktop environment is no where close to as smooth unity is on this laptop. I have tried running Katoolin with and without disk/home encryption (I normally encrypt disk and home folder, so I thought this was the problem). I have even found the same question, but when I actually go to the site, it has been removed by the author. Thanks in advance.\n\nA: I've seen multiple people reporting odd and serious problems after installing katoolin or \"Kali tools\" in Ubuntu. Problems such as boot/login issues, or even Ubuntu now identifying itself in the terminal as being Kali Linux. In general it's a bad idea to \"mix and match\" operating system components unless you know exactly what you're doing.\nI would recommend a fresh install of Ubuntu, and then either \n\n\n*\n\n*installing the individual pentesting tools you need separately on your own in Ubuntu (but not through adding entire Kali repositories to your system)\n\n*installing Kali on a separate partition -- it's designed for professional penetration testing, not to be a super-\"smooth\" desktop. If you're using it for what it's intended for, the \"smooth\"ness of the desktop won't matter as much as the functionality of the powerful tools that you (presumably) need for your job or research.\n", "Q: Bluetooth not working in Ubuntu 16.04 with [0cf3:3004] Atheros adapter My laptop, an MSI GS70 Stealth Pro, has build a build in Bluetooth device that Ubuntu seems to not recognize.\nWhen I go to System Settings > Bluetooth it says No Bluetooth adapters found.\nFrom what I've seen in other threads, I leave here some hopefully helpful info:\nrfkill list:\n1: phy0: Wireless LAN\n   Soft blocked: no\n   Hard blocked: no\n\ndmesg | grep Blue:\n[    2.951161] Bluetooth: Core ver 2.21\n[    2.951173] Bluetooth: HCI device and connection manager initialized\n[    2.951176] Bluetooth: HCI socket layer initialized\n[    2.951177] Bluetooth: L2CAP socket layer initialized\n[    2.951181] Bluetooth: SCO socket layer initialized\n[    2.959062] Bluetooth: HCI UART driver ver 2.3\n[    2.959064] Bluetooth: HCI UART protocol H4 registered\n[    2.959065] Bluetooth: HCI UART protocol BCSP registered\n[    2.959066] Bluetooth: HCI UART protocol LL registered\n[    2.959066] Bluetooth: HCI UART protocol ATH3K registered\n[    2.959067] Bluetooth: HCI UART protocol Three-wire (H5) registered\n[    2.959085] Bluetooth: HCI UART protocol Intel registered\n[    2.959093] Bluetooth: HCI UART protocol BCM registered\n[    2.959093] Bluetooth: HCI UART protocol QCA registered\n[    3.931392] Bluetooth: BNEP (Ethernet Emulation) ver 1.3\n[    3.931394] Bluetooth: BNEP filters: protocol multicast\n[    3.931397] Bluetooth: BNEP socket layer initialized\n[    4.100415] Bluetooth: Patch file not found ar3k/AthrBT_0x00000200.dfu\n[    4.100417] Bluetooth: Loading patch file failed\n[    9.725996] Bluetooth: RFCOMM TTY layer initialized\n[    9.726003] Bluetooth: RFCOMM socket layer initialized\n[    9.726006] Bluetooth: RFCOMM ver 1.11\n[   48.509706] Bluetooth: HIDP (Human Interface Emulation) ver 1.2\n[   48.509710] Bluetooth: HIDP socket layer initialized\n\nlspci -knn | grep Net -A2; lsusb :\n02:00.0 Network controller [0280]: Qualcomm Atheros QCA6174 802.11ac Wireless Network Adapter [168c:003e] (rev 20)\n    Subsystem: Bigfoot Networks, Inc.

Ongoing attempts to fix one bug can sometimes break other things, and these issues are often not fixed within a single day.\nFeel free to try it out, but keep in mind it's totally at your own risk, and it's possible some things won't work properly. But it's probably fine.\n\nA: Yes,  you absolutely can, but bear in mind that 'daily builds' are mere prototypes, not suitable for daily or long term use. They are created for testing new features and new alternative software. \n", "Q: With 16.04 my machine shuts down then restarts when battery level is critically low I thought I had set my machine such that it would shutdown when the power was critically low on battery.\nIn org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.power, I have set use-time-for-policy to false (i.e. no tick in the box) percentage-critical to 4, percentage-action to 3, critical-battery-action  to 'shutdown'.\nIndeed when running under 16.04LTS, it does warn when low and warn when critical and it does shutdown at the threshold.

I'm not sure why it worked but I forgot to care \nOther thing you could try is disabling the Wake-On-Lan feature of your motherboard, if the solution above doesn't do the trick.\nTo do this, you should get to your BIOS (Usually press F2 or DEL repeatedly while booting to enter BIOS) and search for Wake-On-Lan somewhere, and switch it off completely. It depends on the BIOS you've got so I can't lead you there. \nHope it helps!\n", "Q: Two working software centers in Ubuntu - why is this happening? Hi I recently decided to try out Ubuntu 16.04 and Ubuntu in general out of curiosity. I really like it but have run into a strange problem. \nIn the beginning I had one software center from which I could download and install apps. Now I have TWO software centers after some updates have been installed. One of them is more modern and has a lot more apps in it - the other one has less apps. But both of them are there. \nSurely I should only have one software app showing on my computer? \n\n\n\nA: The first screenshot (window title \"Ubuntu Software Center\") shows the old Ubuntu Software Center (package software-center). It comes with Ubuntu up to version 15.10.\nThe second screenshot (window title \"Software\") shows the new GNOME Software Center (package gnome-software). It comes with Ubuntu since version 16.04.\nThe reason why you have both software center applications installed is probably because you upgraded from 15.10 or an older release to 16.04 (or later). That way the new GNOME Software Center gets installed, but the release upgrader does not remove the old Ubuntu Software Center, as they are completely unrelated packages. It simply does not know that one should replace the other - not sure whether that is a bug or a feature though...\nIf you want, you should be able to uninstall the old software center using this terminal command below:\nsudo apt remove software-center\n\nBut please check the list of packages which are going to be removed with it! I can't tell whether any of your installed applications might depend on that package. If there are packages in the list of remove candidates which you definitely don't want to remove or about which you are unsure, it's better to leave a comment and ask for advice than to blindly remove packages.\n", "Q: How to make vim code folding colors more readable I use code folding in vim, e.g. za, zc, zR, ZM\nBut when the code is folded the resulting color - light blue on white is very hard to read for me with poor contrast\n\nI have tried changing my profile's light blue color\n\nto red\n\nand starting new windows but I still get the light blue on white\nHow can I make the light blue on white on code folds be red on white ?\n\nA: It may be easier to add something like the code below to your .vimrc file, rather than changing profile settings in the GUI. \nsyntax enable \"(syntax on also works)  Note that quotes are a comment in .vimrc\nhighlight Folded ctermbg=White ctermfg=Red\n\nIf you already have a highlight line for other purposes add this as a new line below it, e.g. have two highlight lines as opposed to appending it (invalid format).\nSee here for more details and different options. \n", "Q: Vmware kernel module error Ubuntu 16.04 LTS Kernel 4.6\nI downloaded and installed Vmware workstation Pro 12.

Chroot this location. For traceability I would use different users if there is more than 1.\n\n*setup a cronjob (/etc/crontab with the apache user as the one executing this) with a script that scans the directory for new content every few minutes. If new content found let it make a backup of the files on the apache side (compressed tar file with username and a timestamp in the filename) of the files found on the ftp side. \n\n*let the cronjob copy the files over.

I've found a reproducible solution:\nsudo apt-get install firmware-b43-installer\n\nThis works on both 14.04.3 and 16.04. I believe this is firmware for the Broadcom BCM4311 network controller. Oddly, this both fixes the WiFi* and solves \"the halting problem.\" Once apport reported that pci_devices was refusing to terminate at shutdown (though it didn't always report it, even when there were shutdown problems). The WiFi controller is, by my understanding, a PCI device; hence the connection between the two issues I was facing.\nFor details about fixing the WiFi, see this answer of mine.\n*I also purged ndiswrapper* and bcmwl-kernel-source, which are related to the WiFi, but just doing that didn't solve either problem; the installation of firmware-b43-installer was what fixed it, though it's unclear to me whether that by itself would have solved one or both problems.\n", "Q: Revision hardware requirements I have minimal experience with Ubuntu but now it's time to learn.\nI know from previous experience some older computers my not support the latest version.

As for the version, newer versions normally add support for new hardware.  It's a very rare case that they remove support for older.\nIf your memory size is 1GB, then your only option is a 32-bit Lubuntu or Xubuntu flavor if you want to have a really functional operating system without very frequent swapping issues.\nIf it's 2GB, you can use any 32-bit flavor.\nIf it's 4GB you can switch to 64-bit versions provided that your processor supports it.\n", "Q: how to install ubuntu server on remote system through SSH I am trying to install ubuntu server on remote system through SSH.

I was able to install Ubuntu and REFInd without a problem but now my computer boots to Ubuntu by default. When REFInd starts it doesn't show me my install of OS X, instead it only presents me with options for Ubuntu and the OS X recovery partition. My OS X install is still present and I can boot into it if I hold down option key on boot (that only presents me with Macintosh HD) so I'm pretty sure its some issue with the way REFInd is configured. How do I make it so REFInd can see my OS X install so I can choose to boot into either OS.\nAlso how do I make OS X my default OS? I read that I can do it from OS X but in the startup disk, it only shows my Mac HD and has it selected for the start up disk.\nAny help would be greatly appreciated as I haven't been able to find anything online about this issue. \n\nA: Change the timeout value in the refind.conf configuration file. With a value of -1 rEFInd boots directly, with a value of 0, it waits indefinitely. A positive value set the waiting time in seconds.\nFrom the rEFInd documentation:\n\nThus, the rEFInd configuration file might be /boot/efi/EFI/refind/refind.conf, /boot/EFI/BOOT/refind.conf, /Volumes/ESP/EFI/refind/refind.conf, S:\\EFI\\refind\\refind.conf, or something else, depending on your OS and mount point.\n\n\nA: Are you sure that the \"recovery\" option in rEFInd is booting the OS X recovery system? For reasons best known to Apple, they decided to install their non-recovery boot loader on a partition called Recovery HD in recent versions of OS X, so it shows up that way in rEFInd's menu, on the first row. There may also be a second-row icon that launches the actual recovery image.\nIf you're really not seeing an entry in rEFInd, then it may have been accidentally removed by edits to refind.conf -- say, the dont_scan_dirs option or something similar. I recommend you check those. Try restoring the default refind.conf file (called refind.conf-sample in the rEFInd package) and see if that helps.\nAs to setting the default, you can do that with the default_selection option in the refind.conf file -- at least, if you're talking about the default OS in rEFInd.\n", "Q: Installing Ubuntu on a Pentium M i915PM/GM i686 1729 Mhz 1 GB I'm trying to use an old Dell Pentium M i915PM/GM i686 1729 Mhz 1 GB as a dedicated Linux system to run Kali, to learn how to code.\nI've burned a couple of ISOs to disc, but still haven't managed to install the OS.

(I've tested the ISO for errors and downloaded fresh copies of it a few times too, but to no avail)\nHow can I install the OS, without bricking my old PC? The iso that seemed to get the furthest for me was lubuntu-12.04-desktop-i386, but it froze too.\n\nA: If Lubuntu couldn't help you, no other Ubuntu flavor can! All other Buntus are heavier than Lubuntu. For such (old) Pentium you should try some micro-linux (Slax, Puppy, Damn Small Linux, etc) with ultra-lite desktop environment (openbox, icewm, enlightenment, moksha, etc).\nBut that's not that important. The most important part is the coding, which is usually done in a CLI (command-line) environment. Something similar to Command Prompt from Windows. Sometimes referred as 'bash', 'command line' or 'terminal'. All linuxes have a CLI, a Terminal app of some sort.\nKali is very complex and very dangerous for newbies, it has many 'sharp knives' - tools that can be used in offensive ways. You should start with a main distribution like Debian or Fedora, as you might need strong support forums and communities at first.\n\nA: I think you should read This post as there are some similarities in the question you are asking.\nI agree with the advice given above about Kali - stick to a small Linux distro to learn about coding.

I wanted to setup a permanent mount to my synology NAS and following their tutorial I adapted my userid to the one on the synology.\nI created a new user on my machine with sudo rights and typed the following:\nsudo usermod -u 1026 -g 100 myoldlogin\n\nSo my new user can login via Plasma, the new and old user can login via terminal, but my old user cannot login anymore via Plasma GUI.\nMy olduser now really has the userid 1026.\nWhat went wrong, how can I fix this?\n\nA: First of all, group IDs (GID) below 1000 are used by the system and other no-login groups and usually not as primary group for normal user accounts. You should give your user a GID above 1000, ideally the same number as its user ID (UID).\nSecond, file system ownership is bound to user/group IDs, not names. Therefore changing your account's UID and GID will make it lose all rights on files it owned before.\nThis means you have to reassign the ownership of that account's home directory to the new UID/GID pair. The most important file here is probably the ~/.Xauthority file. If that one is not owned by the correct user, it will not be able to log into the graphical desktop.\nYou recursively change the ownership of a directory with this command:\nsudo chown -R USER:GROUP DIRECTORY\n\nSimply replace USER and GROUP with the respective name or ID and use your old user's home directory (e.g. /home/myoldlogin) as DIRECTORY. The command you have to run could then look like this:\nsudo chown -R 1026:1000 /home/myoldlogin\n\n", "Q: Remove/Uninstall Python 3.5 I am trying to uninstall Python 3.5.

Instead the systemd and its systemctl tool accept those commands from regular users.\nAll related commands like shutdown, reboot, halt, poweroff are symbolic links (\"symlinks\") to /bin/systemctl and init is a symlink to /lib/systemd/systemd now by the way.

I always thought if I shred the file, it is completely removed from the disk, i.e. no traces of it left at all. What I'm doing wrong?\n\nA: You're probably doing nothing \"wrong\", but wiping data is much harder than in the floppy disk days.\nUnless your filesystem is non-journalling AND you never defragment the filesystem, the only guarantee to make sure data is completely gone to software is to destroy the entire filesystem, or on an SSD, security wipe the whole disk.\nSee this answer (the \"accepted\" answer in the question is, as you discovered, not completely reliable): https://askubuntu.com/a/58420/544090\nModern file systems transparently move or copy data around for various reasons in their operation. If you overwrite and then delete the most recent location of a file on the disk, there may be an older version of the data from the file in some file fragment somewhere else on the disk. You'll be lucky to recover the whole file again, but as you saw, bits and pieces of the data may still be there. On SSDs this gets even worse because there is wear levelling, where the hardware controller very frequently remaps logical locations on the disk to physical locations on the flash.\nA very rudimentary example is something like this:\n\n\n*\n\n*You create a file, and its data gets stored in location A on the disk.\n\n*For whatever reason, the data is copied to location B on the disk. Now the filesystem will say your file is located at \"B\", but there's still an older copy of your file in location \"A\".\n\n*Your \"shred\" or similar command completely obliterates location \"B\"'s data.\n\n*You can still find a version of the data at location A. (or worse, the \"shred\" causes data to shift again and makes the shred happen to location \"C\", and you still have old bits of the file in locations A and B)\n\n\nSo for data stored on a mechanical hard drive, you'll need to AT LEAST overwrite the whole partition (shred can do this if you run it as root and point it to /dev/). For an SSD you'd have to use the drive's internal secure erase. See: https://serverfault.com/a/694494/354612\nThese methods will make sure that any access to the disk through its interface (SATA, SAS, USB, etc) can no longer see the data. However, there is no definitive answer about how well these types of methods will protect against an attacker who physically opens up your drive to scan the platters / NAND chips themselves. That's why certain organizations still physically destroy old disks.\n", "Q: Gvim won't launch after installing using software center I'm using a fresh installation of Ubuntu 16.04 and have installed Gvim using 'Ubuntu Software'.

That's it.\n", "Q: Remotely log into multiple computers and run a python script I am currently trying to set up network rendering with Blender using computers on different networks. I made a script that launches blender and connects to the host's computer. My problem is that I need to log into all of those computers remotely to launch the script and I am not sure what to use to do that. Optimally I would like to be able to do that with a single keystroke, instead of having to log into each computer separately to start the script. \n\nA: Another option is Ansible. Like SaltStack, Ansible is a configuration management solution. Ansible was literally built to execute commands on multiple remote machines.\nAnsible is nice because you don't have to install anything on the \"target machines\". You simply install it on the host machine (i.e. your computer), and it uses SSH to log into target machines and run shell commands on them.\nHere are instructions to install Ansible on Ubuntu.\nLet's say you want to run your script on 2 target machines, at ip1 and ip2. You could create an Ansible playbook, playbook.yml, as follows:\n---\n- hosts: \"ip1:ip2\"\n  user: \"my_login_user\"\n\n  tasks:\n    - name: \"execute my script\"\n      script: my_script.sh\n\nThen, create your script, my_script.sh or my_script.py or whatever, in the same directory as playbook.yml.\nFinally, run the following from the command line:\nansible-playbook -u my_login_user -i \"ip1,ip2\" --private-key=<path_to_my_private_ssh_key> playbook.yml\nIf you have SSH access to the target machines via that user and SSH key, Ansible will SSH into them and will run your script. You can extend this to as many machines as you want.\n\nA: One available option is to use saltstack to execute the same command on each minion. After adding salt to each computer you can run the same command on each machine with something like\nsalt '*' cmd.exec_code python 'import sys; print sys.version'\n\nIf you are using blender's network render addon then you could also configure a blend file to have network render enabled and setup as a client, then have blender start and open the setup file when the computer is turned on.\nIf you plan to do a lot of rendering you may be interested in doing a bit more setup and creating a render farm. One available from the blender developers is flamenco.\n", "Q: (Internal error) /sbin/upstart I just installed Ubuntu on a quick computer I slapped together.

Whenever I try to install a .Deb file, the orange line that shows the installation process moves a little bit to the right, then the line disappears, the button no longer says Installing and reverts back to the install button, and then nothing happens. Any way to stop this from happening so I can install my files?\n\nA: Based on what you explain I am understanding that you are using Software Center to install your .deb files.\nI suggest you to use the terminal, this way you can see what is causing the problem and probably fix it directly in the terminal.\nThe majority of the times a .deb install and find errors, the system reverts the changes in order to avoid incomplete/dependency unsatisfied packages to be installed.\nPlease open a terminal (CtrlAlt T  in the majority of the cases) and enter the folder where the .deb resides. The place where you placed it when downloaded, via cd foldername.\nOnce you find your .deb, please run sudo dpkg -i file.deb (replace \"file.deb\" with the proper .deb filename and hit RETURN. After which you will be asked for your password.\nOnce you provide your password and hit RETURN the install process will start and show you what is happening and if an error occurs you will be presented with the error's reason.\nYou can then come back and edit your answer in order to include your terminal's output and receive further better support.\nBut!\nWe must first try to see if the install process can continue by writing sudo apt-get -f install, press RETURN in the same terminal, provide your user password and hit RETURN. \nThis is going to attempt the fix of the unsatisfied dependencies and -if everything gets satisfied- the software is going to install.\nIf you receive further errors when running this last command, please add it in your question and we'll see where is the error and -probably- offer a solution for you.\nPlease let us know how you manage this issue and don't forget to include the details of the terminal's output and what you have done so far.\nGood luck!\n\nA: There are several ways you can install deb files: by using (Gnome) Software, Synaptic or gdebi. I personally prefer gdebi, it's the smallest app of its' kind and it has a graphical interface too.  \nYou can install gdebi by opening a Terminal window and type: sudo apt-get install gdebi.

Right now i am logged as John Doe\nHow can i copy files to the var/lib/tomcat7/webapps/ROOT and change their ownership to tomcat7?.\n\nA: To run a command that requiere root privileges you can use 'sudo' in front on your command, ie:\n> sudo cp /home/myhome/file.txt /other/destiny/file.txt\n\nThen, to change the owner:\n> sudo chown myuser /directory/file.txt\n\nYou can find basic bash commands here\n\nA: If you are not in the / directory, you may have to put the absolute path \"/var/lib/tomcat7/webapps/ROOT/styles\" in your copy command\n", "Q: tshark, listen to port does not work How to listen to the port?\nJust connect to host (IP, e.g google.com):\nsudo tshark -i eth0 -H IP  // not working\nsudo tshark -i eth0 -H \"IP\"  // not working\nsudo tshark -i eth0 host IP  // not working\n\nAnd port:\nsudo tshark -i eth0 host IP and port 80 // not working\n\n\nA: -H is to specify a host file in a format similar to your system's /etc/hosts file. \nIf that isn't what you're attempting to use, look into -f flag.  This allows you to use a tcpdump style pre or post filter - depending on where it is placed.\nHere are a few examples: \ntshark -f \"host 192.168.1.1\" -i eth0 -w outputfile.pcap\ntshark -i eth0 -f \"host 192.168.1.1\" -w outputfile.pcap\n\ndumpcap -f \"host 192.168.1.1\" -i eth0 -w outputfile.pcap\ndumpcap -i eth0 -f \"host 192.168.1.1\" -w outputfile.pcap\n\ntcpdump -i eth0 \"host 192.168.1.1 and port 80\" -w outputfile.pcap\n\nAlso, depending on how much traffic your box is seeing, you might look into dumpcap or tcpdump.\n", "Q: Where to find core dumps from gcc and g++ compiled code?

I am running Ubuntu GNOME 16.04 with GNOME 3.20.\n\nA: Core dumping is disabled by default in Ubuntu by setting the maximum dumping file size to 0 for all users.\nYou can check this by:\nulimit -c\n\nBy default it would show 0.\nNow to enable core dumping, set the size to the value you want (or unlimited).\nFor example, setting the maximum dumping file size as 4 KB:\nulimit -c 8\n\n-c takes block numbers with each block being 512 Bytes.\nSetting to unlimited (Not recommended):\nulimit -c unlimited\n\nThis will change the limit for the current user and not permanently.

I do know the passkey to unencrypt everything. It's just a matter of finding the files now. Here's what happened; Yesterday, on the same computer where that SSD is installed, I plugged in another SSD with a fresh install of Windows 7 Ultimate to test a Windows keyboard to see if it worked. It did, so I finished with that (did not touch the Ubuntu SSD), shut down the computer, unplugged the SSD with Windows 7 and then proceeded to boot as normal. As soon as I did that, I got put into Grub Rescue \"Entering rescue mode...\" and have been stuck in it ever since.

I've got Ubuntu 14.04 running in a LUKS container on an SSD.  With it up and running /boot is not encrypted, but everything else is.  So df -h reports /dev/sda1 as the source of /boot and /dev/dm-1 as the source of /.  The actual container for dm-1 is /dev/sda5\nIf you do have LUKS, you should be able to boot to a rescue disk, and use cryptsetup to access it.  \ncryptsetup open <device> <mapping name>\n\nis used to open devices (so would allow me to mount /dev/sda5 from a system booted via LiveCD)\ncryptsetup isLuks <device> will tell you if the device is LUKS\ncryptsetup repair <device> might fix your partition.  Personally, I have take and emailed myself encrypted copies of the luks header, so I can still repair the disk if the header gets corrupted.\nWhat do you see in /proc/partitions on a LiveCD?  It looks to me as though  you have the same partition setup as me, although different partition types.  \nYou may find that sda1 is in fact /boot and sda5 is your encrypted drive.  On my system fdisk reports that sda1 and sda5 are Id 83.  Yours has changed that to 7.  You should be able to change them back, without damaging any data.

I am using Xubuntu 16.04 LTS.\nWhen I run sudo apt-get dist-upgrade in the Terminal there isn't any problem.  \nAfter that, I want to copy the .deb file in /var/cache/apt/archives/ using Thunar file manager, but it doesn't exist. \nSee screenshot below:\n\nBut the locate command finds it:\n\nThe summary, file .deb is there in /var/cache/apt/archives/\nI am confused, what’s wrong with my system?\nCould you help about this problem, please?\n\nA: The reason why you can't find the .deb file in the /var/cache/apt/archives/ directory is because it isn't there anymore.\nThe locate command finds it because locate does not look at the actual directory contents but works from a cache.\nFrom man locate:\n\nlocate  reads one or more databases prepared by updatedb(8) and writes file names matching at least one of the PATTERNs to standard output, one per line.\nBy  default,  locate does not check whether files found in database still exist (but it does require all parent directories to exist if the database was built with --require-visibility no). locate can never report files created after the most recent update of the relevant data‐base.\n\nTo update the database cache, run this command:\nsudo updatedb\n\n\nupdatedb  creates  or updates a database used by locate(1).  If the database already exists, its data is reused to avoid rereading directories that have not changed.\n\nThis should sort out the locate command finding files that no longer exist.\n\nEDIT\nFor the /var/cache/apt/archives/ files not existing, maybe you run a clean command after running the sudo apt-get dist upgrade command.\nAny of these commands will automatically clean out the /var/cache/apt/archives/ directory.\nsudo apt-get clean\nsudo apt-get autoclean\n\nSource: Cleaning out var/cache/apt\n", "Q: Highlight words in Document Viewer I am currently using Ubuntu 15.10. I need to highlight some sentences and/or paragraphs for easy searching but I can't find any option for this in the \"Document Viewer\" which is the default application for pdf files.\n\nA: Document Viewer DOES actually support annotations and highlightings in PDF files (not in other formats).

The latter is the default framework in Ubuntu for Chinese, Japanese, Korean and Vietnamese.\n\nThis claim is disputed, but even if not default, now after upgrading from 2015.10 to 2016.04 ibus-mozc has a problem that makes it unusable for me, so I would like to switch to fcitx-mozc.\nQUESTION: How to switch Ubuntu 2016.04 from ibus-mozc to fcitx-mozc?\nI see a fcitx-mozc 16.04 package, but I guess there is more to do than just installing the package? What is the recommended procedure?\n\nA: *\n\n*Install Japanese. One of the installed packages is fcitx-mozc.\n\n*Close Language Support and open it again.\n\n*Select fcitx as the Keyboard input method system.\n\n*Log out and log in again.\n\n*Click the icon at the very right of the menu bar and select System Settings.\n\n*In the Personal section, click Text Entry.\n\n*Click the + button, select Mozc (Fcitx), and click Add.\n\n\nMore info\n", "Q: difference kill -9 pid and kill pid command what is the difference between kill -9 pid and kill pid command ?\nDo they have different behavior ?\ni know that -9 is for \"SIGKILL\" signal\n\nA: kill pid (which sends signal 15 (SIGTERM)) tells pid to terminate, but said program can execute some code first or even ignore the signal. kill -9 pid, on the other hand, forces the program to immediately terminate (it cannot be ignored).\nYou should always try kill pid first, as it allows the program to do things like saving/closing open files before exiting. Only use kill -9 when you need the program to close and it won't respond to a simple kill pid.\n", "Q: Screen Brightness not binded to Multimedia keys properly After I installed Ubuntu 16.04, I found that the brightness of display was set to brightest possible and I wasn't able to change it. Then I installed Brightness Controller and it worked. Then from some other answer, I binded the 'brightness multimedia key' from my keyboard to control the brightness. But now when I reduce to least bright, the display turns black. How do I set it correct ??\n\nA: I updated my system to recently released Ubuntu 16.10, and it solved this problem. The multimedia key for Brightness control is working properly.\nBut the min value of Brightness leads to black screen.\n", "Q: What is the recommended way to disable a service in 14.04? The specific programs that I needed to disable were nginx and postgresql.\nI have tried the flagship post for this question, which suggests I create a manual override file for upstart, and it does not work for me. Why?\nHowever, the approach described here, using update-rc.d, does work for me.\nI read that systemctl is the suggested approach going forward, but that tool does not exist on my version.\n\nA: Typically those services are started in any of these folders : /etc/init , /etc/init.d , or /etc/rc.2.d , or /etc/rcS .\nFind the file corresponding to the service, and rename it or move to another directory where it won't run.  \n", "Q: Unrecognized Service ssh when building from source So I have a web server that is running 14.04LTS because that is the latest Ubuntu Distribution I can have through my VPS. I have been trying to install OpenSSH 7.2p2 via building the source code via the following commands:\nwget http://mirrors.sonic.net/pub/OpenBSD/OpenSSH/portable/openssh-7.2p2.tar.gz\ntar -zxvf openssh-7.2p2.tar.gz\ncd openssh-7.2p2\n./configure\nsudo make\nsudo make install\n\nAnd when I type ssh -V I get the output: OpenSSH_7.2p2, OpenSSL 1.0.2h  3 May 2016, but when I try service ssh I get ssh: unrecognized service. Any ideas what I'm missing?\n\nA: So with the info Jakuje provided I figured out the solution. This should only be used if you DO NOT have the option to upgrade to a newer LTS version, but need to upgrade OpenSSH and cannot find a ppa with the build you need.\nFirst install openssh-server via sudo apt-get install openssh-server. After that is installed, copy /etc/init/ssh.conf and /etc/init.d/ssh to somewhere safe. Now uninstall openssh-server and openssh-client (which openssh-server installed) via sudo apt-get remove --purge openssh-server and sudo apt-get remove --purge openssh-client. If you plan to use privilege serpartaion follow the instructions here: https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable/blob/master/README.privsep. Now do the following:\nwget http://mirrors.sonic.net/pub/OpenBSD/OpenSSH/portable/openssh-7.2p2.tar.gz\ntar -zxvf openssh-7.2p2.tar.gz\ncd openssh-7.2p2\n./configure --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc/ssh\nsudo make\nsudo make install\n\nAfter this, place the files you copied earlier back where you found them. When you restart your system, the service should be recognized and automatically start!\n\nA: You installed the openssh binaries, but not its Upstart service (the glue connecting ubuntu and openssh service).\nYou also probably installed the files with different paths than used in Ubuntu so getting service file (/etc/init.d/ssh) from Ubuntu wont solve the problem completely (but can give you some guide).\nRegardless what makes you install openssh from source, it is almost never a good idea and you would better be with updating your Ubuntu to latest 16.04.\n", "Q: compile can't find GL lib bjorn@bjorn-031:~/samples/SOP$ gcc -lGL\n/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lGL\n\nI've installed libglu1-mesa-dev and rebooted.

Every time I try to verify it, it crashes. \nWhen I tried the approved methods of installing the firefox plugin using symlinks, firefox didn't even see the darn thing and kept reporting that I was using version 10.55 (from java 7) which is GONE. When I copied libnbjp2.so into the firefox plugins directory, it at least saw it and removed the reference to the old one, which I noticed had parked itself in pluginreg.dat and could not be deleted in any other way.\nI also copied this new lib to /usr/lib/mozilla/plugins (why does this exist?) and ~/.mozilla/plugins and it didn't help. \nAnyone know what gives? Can this combination of things be gotten to work at all, and how do I troubleshoot the problem? \nSeems to me there might be a bug here as the plugin manager gave different results for the same file depending on whether it was a link or a copy.

I am trying to understand why some of tests in my fonts.conf work with <match target=\"pattern\"> (the default), another ones with <match target=\"font\">, and not at all otherwise. For example:\n<match>\n    <test name=\"family\"><string>monospace</string></test>        \n    <edit name=\"family\"><string>Cousine</string></edit>\n</match>\n\n<match>\n    <test name=\"family\"><string>Cousine</string></test>\n    <test name=\"pixelsize\" compare=\"more\"><double>17.5</double></test>\n    <edit name=\"family\" binding=\"strong\"><string>Liberation Mono</string></edit>\n</match>\n\n<match target=\"font\">\n    <test name=\"family\"><string>Overpass</string></test>        \n    <edit name=\"hintstyle\"><const>hintslight</const></edit>\n</match>\n\nWhy is that? I have read the documentation and it only says If 'target' is set to \"font\" instead of the default \"pattern\", then this element applies to the font name resulting from a match rather than a font pattern to be matched. I do not understand the wording, can someone explain the difference?\n\nA: From:\nhttps://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/fontconfig/2007-December/002787.html\n\nApplications typically work like this:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Convert user's font request to a fontconfig pattern;\n  \n*Apply fontconfig configuration on it using target=\"pattern\";\n  \n*Get a sorted list of fonts matching that pattern from fontconfig. The list is returned as a set of fontconfig patterns itself;\n  \n*Choose the font to use (typically the first one having the requested character);\n  \n*Apply fontconfig configuration on the font pattern using target=\"font\".\n  \n  \n  So, what it means is that for example if you want to turn off antialiasing on Bitstream Vera Sans for sizes less than 7.5, you should do that using target=\"font\". If you do it with target=\"pattern\", it will turn off aa for all fonts if the request is Bitstream Vera Sans, regardless of whether you have that font installed or not.\nIf you want to write fallback rules such that DejaVu Sans be substituted for Bitstream Vera Sans, that's done with target=\"pattern\", because you want to modify the request.\n\nAnd also from:\nhttps://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/fontconfig/2003-March/000128.html\n\nUse the font target for all changes to how a particular font is rendered and pattern target for changes in how a font is selected from those available.\n\n", "Q: dual boot system .... windows recovery problem!

However I can see the recovery partition in windows & in the grub menu (but not in Linux) .\n\nA: Could it be that you have installed Ubuntu / Ubuntu's boot loader on the recovery partition? This would not remove or rename the partition but format it and write new contents on it?\nBut no worries, if you can boot into Windows 7, you can get your product key and download the Windows 7 ISO. From there on you can create a bootable Windows 7 USB stick (using this tool and your downloaded ISO) and reinstall Windows 7 at any given time.\nAfter reinstalling Windows, you have to install the appropriate drivers yourself.\nCAUTION!! When installing Windows after you installed Ubuntu, you will destroy GRUB and will not be able to boot Ubuntu anymore (at least not that easy / without restoring GRUB).\nIf you cannot get into your Windows 7 anymore, the Windows 7 key can also be found on a sticker on the bottom of your laptop (in most cases).\n", "Q: How can I convert/migrate root f/s to LVM 2 Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS?

I don't know what that means.  Are you referring to screen brightness?  If it involves the screen, I can refer you to two command-line packages.  xrandr allows you to change screem resolution on the fly.  That works for desktops and laptops.  The package xbacklight only works for laptops.  That allows you to adjust your screen brightness on the fly.  If you want these settings to take place when you log in, make the commands part of a .profile script file in our $HOME folder.

We know that using cd <directory> will open the directory, if it exists!\nAlso, cd .. will take us up one level from the current working directory.\nBut, when we have a nested dir with longer path like /home/thina/teams/td/tech/app/release/apks, it is tiring to just go into the folder apks and also it is hard to get back to another node, say here /home/thina/teams. \nIs there any way to skip the typing of cd and cd ..? I'm using Ubuntu 16.04.\n\nA: To go up in the tree several levels at a time, you can use the following function (thanks to muru for the enhanced version):\nup ()\n{\n    local old=\"$PWD\"\n    for i in $(seq \"${1:-1}\"); do\n        cd ..\n    done\n    OLDPWD=\"$old\"\n}\n\nThen you can do:\n$ pwd\n/home/thina/teams/td/tech/app/release/apks\n$ up 5\ncd'ing into /home/thina/teams\n\nAdditionally:\n\n\n*\n\n*calling up without an argument is equivalent to cd .. due to ${1:-1} which substitutes $1 when set and 1 otherwise\n\n*setting OLDPWD after the last cd .. aims at preserving the usual cd - behavior.\n\n\nA: For long directory names, use variables with full path. For example,\nAPKS=\"/home/thina/teams/td/tech/app/release/apks\"\n\nThen you can do just cd \"$APKS\"\nAs for going up x number of directories, I have this function defined in my .bashrc\ngoup() # go up x number of dirs\n{\n  num=$1\n  while [ $num -ne 0  ];do\n    cd ..\n    num=$( expr $num - 1   )\n  done\n}\n\nTo return to /home/thina/teams from apks you would do \ngoup  6\n\nHere's an example of usage:\n$> pwd\n/sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight\n$> goup 3\n$> pwd\n/sys\n$> \n\nAnother small function that i came up with, but never used as much is bookmark function. \nHere's how it works: it saves your current folder to some file, and then you can cd to a specific directory based on the line number in that file. Example:\n$> cd /etc/lightdm\n$> bookmark\n$> cat ~/.dirsbookmarks                                                                                                  \n/home/xieerqi\n/sys/class/backlight\n/etc/lightdm\n$> cd $( awk 'NR==2' ~/.dirsbookmarks  )                                                                                 \n$> pwd\n/sys/class/backlight\n\nAnd here is the function itself:\nbookmark()\n{ # bookmarks current dir\n  pwd >> $HOME/.dirsbookmarks\n}\n\n\nA: UPDATE: There's an even more powerful tool than autojump: fasd, but I am not familiar with it.\n\nI am surprised no one has mentioned autojump yet which \n\nworks by maintaining a database of the directories you use the most from the command line (Directories must be visited first before they can be jumped to.)\n\nIt's basically what @graipher has built, with a few extra options.\nAs I have mentioned on another question:\nAfter you cd a few times to a directory (even once suffices):\ncd /home/thina/teams/td/tech/app/release/apks\nyou can use the shortcut j to move there quickly, regardless of which directory you're currently in:\nj apks\nNote that using any part of the path works, as long as it's the highest on the list:\nj app will also take you to .../apks if you went there more times than to .../app.\nI would recommend it instead of having your own script since it is well maintained, distributed for Ubuntu, and has other neat features, such as jump to child:\n.../td/tech $ jc apk\n.../release/apks $ \n\nHas moved you to apks in td, rather than some other apks under a different tree.\n\nA: Aliases\nI have a list of frequently used directories directly available via alias.\nThis also includes shortcuts for the directories up the hierarchy.\nalias ..='cd ..'\nalias ...='cd ../..'\nalias ....='cd ../../..'\nalias .....='cd ../../../..'\nalias cdwork=/home/knub/Repositories/work\nalias cduni=/home/knub/University\n\nNow, when I want to go three levels up, I just type ....<Enter> and there I am!    \n\nA: Turn on the autocd option (shopt -s autocd), so that you don't have to type cd. For example, you just need the two-character command .. to go to the parent directory.\nIf you're navigating between two directories, you can toggle between them with cd -, which goes to the previous working directory. The autocd option doesn't make - run cd - but you can define an alias or function for that.\nYou can memorize directories on a stack with the builtins pushd and popd. The builtin dirs lists the directory stack (I find dirs -v more readable).\nIf you frequently change to subdirectories of a particular directory, and these subdirectories have rather unique name, add them to the CDPATH variable. However be warned that I've never found a situation where CDPATH was actually handy.\nYou can set a variable to a directory name and then change to it with $foo.\nZsh  has a few nice features that bash doesn't have. Some of them can be emulated by writing functions that do the same job. In particular the two-argument form of cd lets you conveniently change to another directory with a similar name, e.g. from /home/thina/teams/td/tech/app/release/apks/com.acme/v1, running cd release beta goes to /home/thina/teams/td/tech/app/beta/apks/com.acme/v1.\n\nA: There is pushd and popd:\npushd /home/thina/teams/td/tech/app/release/apks\n# current directory now /home/thina/teams/td/tech/app/release/apks\npopd\n# current directory now what it was before pushd command\n\nTry help pushd and help popd for more options. There is no man page, because pushd and popd are bash built-in commands.\n\nA: As I already answered on a related question on UnixSE, I use a script called z [github] for this.\nIt remembers directories you cd to, ranks them according to frecency (frequency + recency) and allows you to change to one of the remembered paths using some part of its name.\nAfter having cd'ed to a directory at least once you can do e.g instead of:\n$ cd ~user/very/long/path/with/many/subfolders/\n\nJust do:\n$ z sub\n\nwhich will work, using partial name matching (assuming you have no other directory containing in its path the term sub and which has a higher frecency).\nI also defined a function like this, which first tries a normal cd and if that fails uses z:\nfunction cd() {\n    builtin cd \"$1\" 2> /dev/null || z \"$1\" || (echo \"cd: File or Directory not found: $1\" >&2 && exit 1)\n}\n\nThis gives you the best of both. If the folder is in the current directory or a valid full path is given, it will just cd there, but if not it will try to find a match in the database and cd there. This takes away the (small) pain of sometimes having to use cd (to train the database, going to a folder you have never been to before) and sometimes remembering to use z, when applicable.\n\nA: In addition to the very good answers already provided, here are some tips on using cd effectively.\n\n\n*\n\n*cd - will take you back to the last directory you were in.\n\n*cd ../../.. will take you up 3 levels at once, you can use the\n.. notation chained together to 'move up' as many directories as\nyou like.\n\n*If you're not sure how many times you wish to move up, use cd ..,\nthen use bash history by pressing up on the arrow key to use the\ncommand again.\n\n*Use ~ to stand in for the current users home directory, if you're logged in as the user thina, cd ~/teams, will take you to /home/thina/teams\n\n*Use Bash auto-completion for paths, the tab key will complete a section of a path in the cd command, if you type part of a path segment followed by Tab, that segment will be completed if there's no other valid choice. For instance, if you had typed cd /home/thina/teams/td/t then pressed Tab, the word tech would be filled in for you, so long as there were no other files or directories in the td directory that started with the letter t.\n\n\nUsing these tips together can make traversing directories with cd far less painful.\n\nA: Three more options that I find to work well (though I may in the future use pushd more, I only just learned about that):\n\n\n*\n\n*Arrange your paths so you don't need to cd into deeply nested directories in the first place, or rather: so the locations that you need to visit often are right at your fingertips. The way to achieve this is with symlinks: keep the explicit, well-hierarchised directories as they are, but make a quick-access link for your own convenience.\nln -s ~/teams/td/tech/app/release/apks ~/apks\n\nThen, instead of typing the long path to cd, just use cd ~/apks, and cd ../teams (or, in that example preferrable, ~/teams) to get back.\n\n*Don't use a single shell and cd back and forth between paths, but keep one shell running for each of the paths you needs to work in. There are multiple levels on which to achieve this multitasking:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use multiple terminal windows. Works best if the windows live on different workspaces.\n\n*Use multiple tabs in a single window. This is paticularly well-suited for only doing a few commands in some directory: to get back, simply close the terminal tab!\n\n*(Not really sensible IMO, but for completeness:) use a terminal multiplexer like tmux.\n\n*Just launch an action in a single-purpose command that cds down into the folder, does one thing there and immediately gives back control on the original folder: instead of\n$ cd /home/thina/teams/td/tech/app/release/apks\n$ some_command this_file_here\n$ cd ../../../../..\n\nsimply do the one-liner\n$ (cd ~/teams/td/tech/app/release/apks; some_command this_file_here)\n\nor equivalently\n$ sh -c 'cd ~/teams/td/tech/app/release/apks\n> some_command this_file_here'\n\n\n\n*Don't cd at all, but simply execute the command right from your home directory. Brace expansions can help a lot here: Instead of\n$ cd /home/thina/teams/td/tech/app/release/apks\n$ some_command this_file_here other_file_also_apks\n$ cd ../../../../..\n\nyou can do\n$ some_command ~/teams/td/tech/app/release/apks/{this_file_here,other_file_also_apks}\n\n\nA: Pushd and Popd\nThe commands pushd and popd are favorites of mine. The pushd command will remember the directories you've visited, viewable with the command dirs, and when you're ready to jump backwards use popd to return.\nHere's an example using bash functions and aliases:\nsd ()\n{\n    pushd \"$1\" > /dev/null\n}\n\npo ()\n{\n    popd\n}\n\nalias d='dirs'\n\nI constantly use a mix of these commands in a variety of ways.\nAliases\nAnother option for frequently accessed directories is to simply alias the cd or pushd commands. So, using the examples from your post:\nalias cdapks='cd /home/thina/teams/td/tech/app/release/apks'\nalias cdteams='cd /home/thina/teams'\n\nCombination\nCombine the two ideas and you can even have this:\nalias sdapks='sd /home/thina/teams/td/tech/app/release/apks'\nalias sdteams='sd /home/thina/teams'\n\nWhich then gives you a lot of flexibility in traversing directories. I keep the cd*** and sd*** aliases on hand for things like Desktop, Documents, Music, Downloads, etc. and it's very handy!\n\nA: fish has several nice facilities for quickly moving around.\n\n\n*\n\n*If you type c d right-arrow enter, it repeats the most recent cd.\n\n*By using c d up-arrow right-arrow enter, it repeats the second-most recent cd.\n\n*Etc.\n\n*It has prevd and nextd, which are often easier to use than pushd and popd.\n\n\nAlso, I keep my favourite directories symlinked to ~/f, so I can cd ~/f/x to get to ~/foo/bar/baz/experimental-data.\n\nA: Try z.lua - A new cd command that helps you navigate faster by learning your habits.\n\n\n*\n\n*cd to a directory contains foo:\nz foo\n\n\n*cd to a directory ends with foo:\nz foo$\n\n\n*use multiple arguments:\nAssuming the following database:\n10   /home/user/work/inbox\n30   /home/user/mail/inbox\n\n\"z in\" would cd into /home/user/mail/inbox as the higher weighted entry. However you can pass multiple arguments to z.lua to prefer a different entry. In the above example, \"z w in\" would then change directory to /home/user/work/inbox.\n\n*cd with interactive selection:\nWhen there are multiple matches found, using z -i will display a list:\n$ z -i soft\n3:  0.25        /home/data/software\n2:  3.75        /home/skywind/tmp/comma/software\n1:  21          /home/skywind/software\n> {CURSOR}\n\nThen you can input the number and choose where to go before actual cd. eg. input 3 to cd to /home/data/software. And if you just press ENTER and input nothing, it will just quit and stay where you were.\nz.lua also supports fzf for interactive selection or argument completion:\ncompletion with fzf\n\n*fast go back to parent without typing cd ../../..:\nNew option \"-b\" can quickly go back to a specific parent directory in bash instead of typing \"cd ../../..\" redundantly:\n\n\n*\n\n*(No argument): cd into the project root, the project root the nearest parent directory with .git/.hg/.svn in it.\n\n*(One argument): cd into the closest parent starting with keyword, if not find, go to the parent containing keyword.\n\n*(Two arguments): replace the first value with the second one (in the current path).\n...\nLet's start by aliasing z -b to zb:\n# go all the way up to the project root (in this case, the one that has .git in it)\n~/github/lorem/src/public$ zb\n  => cd ~/github/lorem\n\n# cd into to the first parent directory named g*\n~/github/vimium/src/public$ zb g\n  => cd ~/github\n\n# substitute jekyll with ghost\n~/github/jekyll/test$ zb jekyll ghost\n  => cd ~/github/ghost/test\n\nWish it could fit your need.\n\nA: I've long used aliases for frequently accessed directories. \nI also have a bash function called ccb(short for create cd bat file -- this originated in dos/windows where the .bat shell script ccb.bat would create another .bat file for jumping to the current directory)that creates/appends aliases(in the .bash_aliases file) to the current directory.\neg : $ ccb myfav\nwill create an alias to the current directory with an alias myfav in the .bash_aliases file and source the .bashrc file so the alias is immediately available.\nI just now found a new solution.

In System Settings > Sound, there is only the internal mic in the list of input devices. I think the problem could be related with the fact that the drums send no other information besides the sound stream itself (maybe it should send also some information useful for the driver to recognize it as a microphone/input stream).\nI've already tried using pavucontrol, audio-recorder, audacity, alsamixer, but none of them gave me any good result. Do you have any ideas of how could I manually force Ubuntu to use the data from the headphone/mic port as an input audio stream?\n\nA: What you need is an adapter. The jack for your drums has two or three connections depending on whether it’s mono or stereo. The headphone/mic input on your laptop four connections.\n\n", "Q: How to get rid of google chrome keyring I have recently switched from firefox to google chrome on Ubuntu 16.04.  The keyring application is really starting to annoy me.  It keeps prompting me for password for no apparent reason.  Also google chrome randomly seems to forget passwords for some sites.  I would like to completely disable the keyring feature and have it just remember my passwords without me needing to enter another password.  I do not care to much about security since this is my personal system that no one else has access to.  How can I make chrome remember my passwords without every prompting me with keyring.\n\nA: For Ubuntu 16.04 Open \"Password and Keys\" \nIn the view and make sure \"By Keyring\" option is checked. \nThen in the left side, right click on keyring (or default keyring whatever it is) and click on unlock. \nIt will ask for the password, for me this was the same I set in the first time I installed Ubuntu.\nEven if you changed login password after installation, enter the password used for the first time... it should work. If it does, right click on keyring again and delete it (it will also delete any passwords it might have saved).\n\nA: In my Ubuntu MATE, go to Applications > Accessories > Passwords and Keys\nYou can also load it from shell: seahorse.\nThen delete the \"default\" keyring. \nThen reopen Chrome/ium again.

How can I customize what applications it finds?\nCurrently I'm using lubuntu 15.10, but I'm interested in the answer for lubuntu 16.04 as well.\n\nA: Desktop environments don't process the .bashrc file.\nIn order for you to have the path available to the Alt+F2 run dialog, you need to edit your ~/.profile file, as a regular user, sudo is not required.  You can use any editor such as nano or gedit.\nAdd the following line to the bottom of the .profile file:\nPATH=\"/path/to/folder:$PATH\"\nAlternatively, if you have a line such as the one below:\nPATH:\"/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/home/treedev/lib/Qt/bin\"\nYou can add your path to that following the same convention of paths being separated by a colon.

On BQ Aquaris-M10, gmails appear in the notification area drop-down (upper-right corner) turning the envelope green with e-mail headers shown below.\nWhen I touch an individual e-mail to launch full-screen; sometimes it launches, sometimes the gmail symbol shakes signifying \"no\", sometimes it launches after several attempts.\nWhy the inconsistent response when, to me, it seems like consistent input?\n\nA: As per the answer above, you have to specifically tap the Gmail icon in the notification itself. This can be rather tricky if you have big fingers as it is a bit of a small icon. Also if you slide the notification to the right, the delete icon is shown. However, tapping this does not delete the email in question, rather it deletes the notification. this is not as useful as deleting the email from your client. I raised this a bit ago that if you click on any part of the notification, it should open the email. Also if you click the delete icon, this should delete the email not just the notification. To add to this, if you change your email client (say to Dekko) you cannot open it from the notification. When you click on the email icon, it will take you to the Gmail client and not Dekko to read your mail. If you remove the Gmail client, email notifications do not come through.\n\nA: You have to tap the gmail icon to open it, though you would expect tapping anywhere in the notification would open it. They are currently re-designing the messaging indicator. Sometimes, it takes a few taps for it to activate as it is sensitive to the position of the tap.

I've been messing around with this problem for some hours now so I'm posting this here.\nI'm having 3 monitors here, all connected to card previously mentioned. 2 of the monitors (Samsung 19\" and Samsung 22\") are connected via DVI and third one, Philips 58\" (it's not actually 58\", just showing up in the settings like that for some reason) is connected via HDMI-Displayport adapter. There is also Sony amplifier connected via HDMI. All these connected in one card and everything is showing up properly. I've installed nVidia binary driver, version 361.42 from nVidia-361 (proprietary, tested) and everything seems fine with it.\nI've used display manager (All settings->Displays) to set layout for these monitors. I can easily set 19\" and 22\" Samsung monitors side by side, 19\" being on the left side and 22\" on the right. Now I would like to have this big Philips screen on top of the other screens mentioned before. But I can't manage to get this done.\nI'm trying to use display manager and just drag this Philips monitor on top of the others but just can't get it there, for some reason. I can't set it side by side with others either, there is always small gap between monitors. It just wont go there. I would like to have this Philips screen on top of Samsung 22\", which is my main screen. So when I would move my mouse through top border of Samsung 22\", it would appear through bottom of Philips screen.\nI had this similar setup in Windows 8.1 and was working fine and I really hope I can find way to get it working in Ubuntu. Maybe I'm just missing something obvious here.\n\n^ Here you can see how my configuration is at the moment; Samsung 19\" being on the left, Samsung 22\" on the right, then there is this small gap between Samsung 22\" and Philips and then there is also Sony amplifier showing on the right (the one with empty desktop, I've no idea why it is also showing up, I can disable it, but then it will affect my sound settings, there won't be no sound at all. Any chance to get rid of it without losing sound?)\n\nA: I got it working, though I'm not quite sure why it worked because I didn't really change anything. Dragging those monitors in display manager seems bit sticky/buggy but finally got monitor layout way I wanted.\n", "Q: OpenStack Autopilot I am in the process of downloading the vSphere evaluation disc of ubuntu autopilot, I would be keen to hear from anyone who has deployed a Cloud with this software, like every single OpenStack deployment middleware I am assuming it is very restrictive?

It used to work, and then I messed up something (unrelated issue) and decided I should start from scratch since the computer was still new so I re-installed Ubuntu 16.04. All I meant with this is that I have no hardware problem. \nEverytime I plug in my GPU on my motherboard and turn my computer on, my screen stays entirely black during the whole process ; I do not get any kind of image during POST, boot, login, etc. This is particularly annoying since it prevents me from installing the drivers (I am assuming the graphic card has to be plugged in the computer for the drivers to be installed?). I've also been experiencing issues installing the drivers, but if my screen is on with the graphic card plugged in I assume I can figure my way back to a fully working computer.\nI tried a lot of things up to now, but I'm still open to suggestions.\nEDIT : Ok I feel really stupid not noticing before. My problem is not solved, but my screen is not actually black, there's just no video output. for some reason I thought there was output before but there never was. The monitor is plugged in the motherboard, not the graphic card (although both give me no output).\nADDED : if a solution involves re-installing Ubuntu, I'm okay with that. It's been re-installed several times today.\nEDIT 2 : Attempted multiple solutions today, always after a fresh re-install. I am out of ideas. Googled everything I could google, tried mixing different solutions to adapt to my computer (most solutions out there do not match my exact computer specs), no success. I am posting my specs hoping that someone knows what to do. \nMotherboard : GIGABYTE z170a\nCPU : i7 6700k \nGPU : NVIDIA GTX 970 (the one I am trying to install)\nUbuntu 16.04 \nPlease also add the part which confuses me a lot since the beginning : at what point during the installation of the drivers should I plug in my graphic card into my desktop, and is it normal that without a successful driver installation that my monitor gets no video output (I still get an audio output and manage to blindly activate commands from terminal such as shutdown). I am wondering since nvidia-installer tells me it can't detect modules, I thought maybe these are in the graphic card and cannot be detected because I didn't plug it in. But I am not sure. \n\nA: I have solved my problem.\nI first write the potential source of my problem, and in the next paragraph I explain my solution. I recall my specs here : \nMotherboard : GIGABYTE z170a\nCPU : i7 6700k \nGPU : NVIDIA GTX 970 (the one I am trying to install)\nOS : Ubuntu 16.04 \nSource of the problem : I had the graphic card running before, and an issue forced me to re-install the OS. This caused my BIOS to set the graphic card chosen for display during POST to be my NVIDIA card, which had no drivers anymore because I re-installed the OS. Therefore I would get a black screen and could not run my computer with the graphic card plugged in. Because I didn't recall how I setup my graphic card the first time, this lead me to think that I needed to plug in the graphic card AFTER installing the driver, but it goes the other way around ; you cannot install the driver without the graphic card plugged in. \nSolution : I went into the BIOS, and indeed the graphic card selected for POST was the PCI slot I was using before for the graphic card. If this is the case, unplug the graphic card, for it will cause your monitor to get no video output, even if your monitor is plugged in your motherboard. In the BIOS of my motherboard (GIGABYTE GA-z170 Gaming K3), one must select \"IGFX\" instead of \"PCI Slot 1\" (or whatever slot was set there) as the graphic card selected for POST ; for a different motherboard, find the option which enables the integrated graphics of the motherboard, not the GPU's. Complete the boot, shutdown, plug in the graphic card and reboot. Your monitor should display nomrally. \nI ran the following commands after a fresh install of my OS, but I assume they could also work if no NVIDIA drivers have been previously installed or if old NVIDIA drivers have been purged (via sudo apt remove --purge nvidia*)\nIn a terminal, enter the following commands : \n\n\n*\n\n*sudo apt update && sudo apt dist-upgrade (this is always good to do whether you're installing drivers or not, keeps your computer up to date)\n\n*sudo add-apt-repository ppa:graphics-drivers/ppa\n\n*sudo apt update\n\n*sudo reboot (might not be necessary, but I didn't take any chances)\n\n\nAfter logging in again, open a terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T) and enter the following command, where *** must be replaced by the version of the driver you want to install :\nsudo apt install nvidia-***\nIn my case, I installed the latest (28/06/2016) driver, which is nvidia-367. So the command looked like this :\nsudo apt install nvidia-367 \nTo check that your graphic card is indeed being used to display graphics, go in the \"About this computer\" section (or System Settings -> Details) which should display \"Graphics GeForce (...)\" instead of \"Graphics Intel (...)\". \nI have not tested other drivers. I have spent five days on this, so I guess I became a sort of medium expert on these issues...\nRemark : I did not disable anything in the file /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf and did not add any extra file in there. I am guessing that the script installing nvidia-367 takes care of disabling nouveau, whereas when installing directly from the .run installer from nvidia.com, one must do this manually. \nHope that helps,\n\nA: Actually you have a default graphic card. For use latest driver you need go to  painel configuration and going to software and update --> aditional driver and choice latest proprietary driver. This resolve all probleme with my graphic card\nGood luck\n\nA: That's my first post here, so hope to be clear enough and that'll help anybody running similar issues.\nI've run onto almost the same problem, i.e. trying to install Ubuntu 16.04 with my GeForce GTX970 plugged in.\nHere my personal specs:\n\n\n*\n\n*MoBo: Gigabyte GA-Z97X-UD5H \n\n*CPU: Intel i7-4790K\n\n*GPU: Msi GeForce GTX 970 Gaming 4G\n\n\nI personally have dual boot with 2 separate SSDs, one with Win10 and one for Ubuntu.\nMy problem is very similar to the one's of Patrick, i.e. Ubuntu won't display correctly on screen (i'm getting a total black screen) if my GPU is plugged in. The only possible option to run the Ubuntu installation for me was to physically unplug the GPU from my MoBo and to run the installation using the integrated Intel Graphics of my MoBo. After that I enabled the PPA for installing proprietary NVIDIA graphics drivers and rebooted this time with the GPU plugged in. This time, the Ubuntu OS has automatically selected the appropriate NVIDIA driver for me (I assume that's because I enabled the PPA, so now it did find the appropriate driver source), so I didn't have to install nothing manually. \nMy install steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot into BIOS and make sure that the integrated graphics of your motherboard is enabled, and that'll be also selected at startup. For my Gygabyte MoBo I hat to set \"Initial Display Output\" to \"IGFX\" and \"Intel Processor Graphics\" to \"enabled\" in the \"Peripherals\" tab.\n\n*Turn off your PC and plug out the GPU from the motherboard. Make sure to connect the HDMI cable to the HDMI port of your motherboard (you should't have any other option as you have no GPU now attached).\n\n*Install Ubuntu (now the display should be fine with no GPU installed).\n\n*After finishing installation and reboot, enable the NVIDIA graphics driver PPA by entering (as pointed out by Patrick) sudo add-apt-repository ppa:graphics-drivers/ppa and then sudo apt-get update in a terminal window. Then shut down the PC.\n\n*Now (this was a crucial step for me), always having the GPU unplugged, go back to the BIOS, and set the initial diplay output back to the PCI Express port (for me I had to select \"PCIe 1 Slot\"), make sure to save the settings and then shut down. If you don't do so and plug the GPU back in (at least in my case), I wasn't able anymore to go back to the BIOS (having the GPU plugged in and the initial output set to \"IGFX\", I was stuck in the POST screen on the MoBo HDMI and I had no video output on the GPU HDMI. Sounds like a bug on MoBo side.\n\n*Now plug the GPU back in, switch the HDMI cable from the MoBo to the GPU port, and boot to Ubuntu. In my case, the drivers were installed automatically and everything went fine. If you go to the system settings, select \"software and updates\" and go to the \"additional drivers\" tab, you should see a list of available drivers, with one being selected per default.\n\n\nHope this helps!\n", "Q: Unable to locate package libfam0-dev I am trying to install Maya 2015 on my laptop, Ubuntu 14.04, 64 bit, and I can't continue with sudo apt-get install -y alien csh tcsh libaudiofile-dev libglw1-mesa elfutils gamin libglw1-mesa-dev mesa-utils xfs xfstt ttf-liberation xfonts-100dpi xfonts-75dpi ttf-mscorefonts-installer libfam0 libfam0-dev because the package libfam0-dev is missing.\nI get this error message:\nReading package lists...

Results are for my present machine and will be different in yr case.\n$ xinput --list  # list of Xorg session input devices\n⎡ Virtual core pointer                 id=2 [master pointer (3)]\n⎜   ↳ Virtual core XTEST pointer       id=4 [slave pointer (2)]\n⎜   ↳ SynPS/2 Synaptics TouchPad       id=10 [slave pointer (2)]\n⎜   ↳ PS/2 Generic Mouse               id=11 [slave pointer (2)]\n⎣ Virtual core keyboard                id=3 [master keyboard (2)]\n    ↳ Virtual core XTEST keyboard      id=5 [slave keyboard (3)]\n    ↳ Power Button                     id=6 [slave keyboard (3)]\n    ↳ Video Bus                        id=7 [slave keyboard (3)]\n    ↳ Sleep Button                     id=8 [slave keyboard (3)]\n    ↳ AT Translated Set 2 keyboard     id=9 [slave keyboard (3)]\n    ↳ HP WMI hotkeys                   id=12 [slave keyboard (3)]\n\nAs you can see the present touchpad is identified as \"SynPS/2 Synaptics TouchPad\", next, to list yr touchpad properties, do in terminal:\n$ xinput --list-props \"SynPS/2 Synaptics TouchPad\" | grep -e Finger\n# Replace \"SynPS/2 Synaptics TouchPad\" above with yr own touchpad description.\nSynaptics Finger (275): 25, 30, 0\nSynaptics Two-Finger Pressure (281):    282\nSynaptics Two-Finger Width (282):   7\nSynaptics Two-Finger Scrolling (285):   1, 1\n\nTo understand the listed properties in detail, look up $ man 4 synaptics. \n\"Synaptics Finger\" is the property of interest here:\n\n\n*\n\n*Finger Low = 25 <- when finger pressure drops below this value, the driver counts it as a release.\n\n*Finger High = 30 <- when finger pressure goes above this value, the driver counts it as a touch.\n\n\nAs you see I like to keep my touchpad on the sensitive side. You, on the other hand, probably want to tweak \"Finger High\" and set it to a higher value, 50 or 60 or more. It depends as much on yr hardware as it does on you. You just need to experiment to fine tune yr hardware to yr specific needs. For instance:\n $ xinput --set-prop [device number] \"Synaptics Finger\" 25 60 0\n\nIn my use-case [device number] would correspond to 10 (as seen above from $ xinput --list) I increased the property \"FingerHigh\" above from 30 to 60. That translates in yr touchpad becoming less sensitive to spurious contacts.\nAnother way to configure yr device on the fly, without the need to restart yr Xorg session, is to use the cli utility synclient.  It queries and modifies Synaptics driver options. This would allow you to adjust touchpad features that are not be exposed via the GUI. One would adjust parameters via a terminal:\n $ synclient FingerHigh=60\n\nSee $ man synclient for more details. \nAlthough that type of configuration is not permanent and will not survive a reboot, it will help you in experimenting with values.

When I ran cgps I was greated with a timeout error.\nI assumed something was wrong with the GPS because I has not been used in a while so I ran gpsmon. The gps had gained a fix on multiple saltiles and had acquired my lat and long.\nThis lead me to believe that something must be wrong on the GPSD side so I ran the command gpsd -N -D3 -F /dev/ttyUSB0. I was met with:\ngpsd:ERROR: can't bind to local socket /dev/ttyUSB0\ngpsd:ERROR: control socket create failed, netlib error -1\n\nEven when I directed GPSD to the socket with gpsd -N -D3 -F /var/run/gpsd.sock /dev/ttyUSB0, (code lifted directly from the GPSD troubleshoot page) I was still receiving the same error.\nI have no clue what is going wrong. I am very new to GPSD and not very comfortable with Ubuntu more generally so maybe I am making a simple mistake. Any help is greatly appreciated.\n\nA: A BU-353 should work out of the box with gpsd.  But you have a a few things going on, \n\n\n*\n\n*the first item is systemd is in charge of launching an instance of gpsd. Until it is turned off (sudo service gpsd stop) you will be chasing your tail.  \n\n*-F Creates a control socket for device addition and removal commands.  It must be a valid pathname on your local filesystem. It is doubtful your control socket would possibly be the USB gps you're trying to read. Typically the control socket is /var/run/gpsd.sock but could be /tmp/anything\n\n*you need to have write permissions to open the control socket. sudo gpsd -N -D3 -F /var/run/gpsd.sock works, while gpsd -N -D3 -F /var/run/gpsd.sock will fail because non-privileged user cannot write to the control socket. Likewise, gpsd -N -D3 -F /tmp/when_pigs_fly should work. (But, none will work if a gpsd is already running.) \n\n\nAdditionally you must consider additional instructions in /etc/default/gpsd For example,\n# Default settings for the gpsd init script and the hotplug wrapper.\n\n# Start the gpsd daemon automatically at boot time\nSTART_DAEMON=\"true\"\n\n# Use USB hotplugging to add new USB devices automatically to the daemon\nUSBAUTO=\"true\"\n\n# Devices gpsd should collect to at boot time.\n# They need to be read/writeable, either by user gpsd or the group dialout.\nDEVICES=\"/dev/ttyACM0\"\n\n# Other options you want to pass to gpsd\nGPSD_OPTIONS=\"\"\n\nThese are introduced in /lib/systemd/system/gpsd.service as an EnvironmentFile\nThe first line is useless.  systemd is in charge and does not fork off the process.  It runs with the -N flag.\nI set USBAUTO=\"true\" because gpsd's use  of udev and hotplugging is fairly transparent-.  Plug in something that's a gps and it works.  If it's not gps, it minds it's own business.\nBut I do code in the location of a gps that I'm currently working with.  Because, stopping/restarted gpsd without rebooting, the gpsd won't 'know' about the gps at /dev/ttyACM0 (or wherever it is) without a hotplug event.  I code in the location to not have to un/plug the gps every time I restart gpsd without a reboot.\nOther GPSD_OPTIONS= could include -n -G or -b at your discretion.\nAdditionally, there are other test clients (xgps) that are more robust for checking gps output, but that should get you pointed in the right direction.\n\nA: It's permissions - get the same error on a raspberry that is just adding/running the command with sudo/root permissions.\nsudo gpsd /dev/ttyUSB0 -F /var/run/gpsd.sock\n", "Q: Is libsqlite3-0 installed by default?

Part of the migration was that it is easier to just define a dependency on php-sqlite3 or similar so if we ever go to php7.1 or such, and a package just depends on php-sqlite3 it automatically pulls in the correct version.  This also makes it easier on setup scripts and users to just install php-sqlite3 instead of having to memorize what PHP numeric version is in use (or worse, hardcode the version to use).\n", "Q: Brightness controls disabled upon unplugging HDMI I'm running Ubuntu Gnome 14.04 on a Thinkpad X1 Carbon.

(apologies since I cannot find a video on my Mac that has multiple audio/subtitles).\n\nAs can be seen from the screen (one with red line), subtitles are process in 2 ways. burned (video will be reencoded) and mux (video will NOT be reencoded). --I would like to have both options. And video and audio both have a passthrough option which I would like to have.--\nI've looked at the MP4tools \"package\" and it seems it's just a frontend to ffmpeg.

If you choose mkv as output then there is no trouble. Just disable autio streams that you don't need. This process is without reencoding so it is very fast and no quality loss.

I have been experiencing some problems with Wifi applet display error (after resume from Suspend) and with hibernation resume. I enabled hibernation on menu using the method shown here . Now hibernation resume is not working intermittently. Sometimes it works fine, other times it displays text on resume that says something about 'clearing orphaned inodes' and the system simply boots up anew, without the prior memory state. \nHere's some info:\n$ sudo blkid\n/dev/sda1: LABEL=\"System Reserved\" UUID=\"50921EE4921ECE7A\" TYPE=\"ntfs\" PARTUUID=\"dda192f8-01\"\n/dev/sda2: LABEL=\"Primary Disk\" UUID=\"765E305F5E3019F7\" TYPE=\"ntfs\" PARTUUID=\"dda192f8-02\"\n/dev/sda3: LABEL=\"Secondary Disk\" UUID=\"E2D42C6AD42C42E1\" TYPE=\"ntfs\" PARTUUID=\"dda192f8-03\"\n/dev/sda5: UUID=\"dbaad068-46da-4637-9c45-5c32c20d3cfe\" TYPE=\"swsuspend\" PARTUUID=\"dda192f8-05\"\n/dev/sda6: UUID=\"31385b29-f351-4a10-9dcf-c92efd58334b\" TYPE=\"swap\" PARTUUID=\"dda192f8-06\"\n/dev/sda7: UUID=\"1f734f56-7328-4029-88a0-fa995426d4d2\" TYPE=\"ext4\" PARTUUID=\"dda192f8-07\"\n\n$ cat /etc/initramfs-tools/conf.d/resume\nRESUME=UUID=31385b29-f351-4a10-9dcf-c92efd58334b\n\n\nA: Well, I am surprised nobody suggested this as I have been having this problem for quite some time. The answer it seemed was staring right in my face. Apparently my swap partition was roughly the same size as my memory. Also, I hadn't added the link to my swap partition's UUID in my grub file. After increasing the swap partition size to double that of the memory and adding its UUID in the grub file the hibernation resume is working normally for the past few days. Although, the resume from hibernation takes a tad bit longer but I'm not complaining.\nYou need to make sure that your swap partition is defined in the following files:\n\n\n*\n\n*/etc/initramfs-tools/conf.d/resume\n\n*/etc/default/grub\nUPDATE\nUsing low level interface uswsusp as default hibernating mechanism drastically improved my resume time to under a minute !!!\nsudo apt-get install uswsusp\nCreate file /etc/pm/config.d/00sleep_module and add following line:\n\n\n*\n\n*SLEEP_MODULE=\"uswsusp\"\n\nA: I just \"fixed\" EXACTLY the same problem, and thus will provide my solution here, even if your problem is different.\nI first iterated through by-uuid issues (as I removed systemd, I thought sysvinit could cause device order to be messed up, as suggested elsewhere, and an uuid reference should have solved the problem. Or so I thought.\nIt appeared to be good for a week, or even two, then it started again.\nAfter this, I remembered what trouble I had with Gentoo, where I had to explicitly set the resume=/dev/disk/by-uuid/{} in grub.cfg, otherwise it did not resume, no matter what. There, it fixed my problem. I even installed dracut to manage my initramfs. It again worked for a while, then it didn't.\nThen I tried different stuff like downgrading kernel, installing bootlogd, but nothing suggested anything special.\nAt this point, I started to look for more help. I grasped all the - not quite readable - information here at kernel.org. I tried this, and that, I not quite remember what I did exactly, but hey.\nAgain it worked sometimes, then again it didn't.\nNow that's where I actually went paranoid, looking for hidden modules in the kernel and envisaging cold boot attacks, figuring that somebody probably got my BIOS assword, resumes from hibernation, then resets the computer and dumps memory booting from some foreign imaging system. (Please note that all this is absolutely not far-fetched, just - as it turned out - completely unrelated.)\nIn this quest - today evening - I managed to find this site:\nhttps://01.org/blogs/rzhang/2015/best-practice-debug-linux-suspend/hibernate-issues. From here, I added the parameters at 2.1 initcall_debug, 2.3 ignore_loglevel, and 2.4 dynamic debug to my grub.cfg as kernel boot parameters.\nThen it happened, again.\nBut now I was more attentive. I noticed that my \"orphaned inode\" stuff is due to \"Superblock last write time is in the future\". I spent some hours finding out what's wrong back then, some half a year before, again to no avail. I just assumed that it is related to the lack of systemd and my habit of using localtime as hwclock (due to occasional dual-booting with W7), so it must be in the interval of 6-10 minutes (imprecise clock source) to 2 hours maximum (I am in GMT+1 DST).\nBoy, was I wrong.\nIt so happened that now, with the ignore_loglevel kernel parameter added, the bootlog contained the EXACT date my clock was at at the boot time, as well as the modification time.\nMy clock was actually set to Jun 06, 2013, which is presumably the BIOS release date, or something similar. That is a three years difference (97010350.488716 seconds according to ntpdate).\nAs such, I finally figured out that my CMOS battery is busted. It might be kinda charged - even that it is not rechargeable -, and when I left the computer on for extended periods, it might have picked up a charge enough to \"survive\" for 1-2 days - or it was maybe just the temperature, who knows. (This is not my primary computer, so it did went some consecutive days unpowered every other week.)\ntl;dr:\nThat said, I either recommend to swap out your CMOS battery, or - if it is a laptop computer or similar -, then\n\n\n*\n\n*(optional, if you use default install of Xenial 16.04, you do not need this) install and configure bootlogd, so that you will find your bootlog in /var/log/boot. (With systemd, you just run journalctl -b to get the bootlog.)\n\n*Edit your /boot/grub/grub.cfg file, and add initcall_debug ignore_loglevel at the end of the first line starting with linux /boot/vmlinuz... under the first line starting with menuentry.\n\n*Reboot now. This is very important, so that you will hibernate with the new settings activated.\n\n*Hibernate, leave the machine off for a sizable amount of time, like hours at least, then resume.\n\n*Finally, either run journalctl -b > /var/log/boot if you did not remember to have removed something called systemd and/or installing something called upstart, openrc, or sysvinit.\nFor all these steps you need to be root, so it is advised that you start with a sudo -s command after every restart, and install something like Midnight Commander (apt install mc or Software Center) at first and use that (mc) to work with the configs and logs.\nNow you have a log in /var/log/boot, in which you can look for events at boot like the actual cause for \"orphaned inodes\". If you find the \"modification time in the future\" trouble, with many hours or more a difference, then you definitely have your CMOS/RTC battery doomed too, and will need to replace it.\n", "Q: My laptop is not been able to boot Just yesterday I was working on windows 7 in my laptop (which is even having Ubuntu 14.04).\nAfter that I selected to restart the laptop to continue my work from ubuntu,\nbut after the restart happen, GRUB boot loader is not shown and only the laptop logo is seen several times.\nwhat do i have to do to get it repaired without erasing the storage part?\n\nA: I had the same problem .\nthe solution is boot-repair.\ndownload the iso from here and then make a bootable usb (you can use UNetbootin to make it).\nboot your laptop on it than choose \"Recommended Repair\".\nit will automatically reinstall Grub and repair your laptop without erasing the storage part.\nyou can see this link for more informations:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Boot-Repair\n", "Q: apt-get broke after trying to install wine I'm a new Linux user.

Originally, the merger was scheduled for kernel 4.7 by AMD but there were a lot of retentions at the side of the mainline kernel developers.\nHence, at the moment of this writing (kernel 4.9 is current) you only have three choices\n\n\n*\n\n*Abstain from audio output through HDMI/DisplayPort and wait\n\n*Use the proprietary AMDGPU Pro driver\n\n*Use a self-compiled kernel that already includes DAL\n\n\nSee Bug 98809 on freedesktop.org.\n\nA: Have you tried to change the output profile to \"Digital Stereo (HDMI) output\" in \"Audio Setup\" from Kmix menu? \nThis procedure is explained here: Sending sound only through HDMI (kubuntu)\n", "Q: HP Notebook 17-y020ca under XUbuntu 16.04 unable to resume from suspend I recently purchased an HP Notebook 17-y020ca and installed Ubuntu 16.04. I originally had to overcome some WiFi issues with the Broadcom Corporation BCM43142 wireless card, but now that side of things appears to be working well. \nUnfortunately, there is a fatal issue remaining: the laptop is completely unable to resume after suspending.  This behavior is deterministic -- while suspend appears to place the computer in a standard \"suspended\" state (with a slowly blinking light), a resume following a suspension yields a slightly glowing screen with no text or indication of display of any content.  Perhaps most notably, the disk light flickers occasionally (suggesting that some processes remain active), but the computer is completely unresponsive.\nControl-Alt-F1 (which normally brings me to another console) does nothing  While it is possible that this is simply a display problem, I have not been able to escape via anything but a complete shutdown.\nAs the video device is often suspect in similar problems experienced by others, I would note that the information on my video card (as output from  \"lspci -vnn | grep -A12 VGA\") is as follows:\n\n00:01.0 VGA compatible controller [0300]: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

I much appreciate your consideration!\nSincerely,\nNathaniel Osgood\n\nA: After much research, experimentation and observation, I found the problem above that was the machine was indeed resuming almost entirely -- it was simply not properly setting the video state so that the monitor was on and displaying contents.  I am not sure if this was due to a bug in the amdgpu driver, elsewhere in the kernel, but I found that the easiest way to resolve this was to ignore the man page information for pm-suspend regarding the antiquated character of \"--quirk-radeon-off\", and indeed to  use that option as follows:\npm-suspend --quirk-radeon-off\nUpon resuming, the system resets the video card in the correct state, and the system works well.\nI hope that this discovery is of use to others with HP Pavilion laptops, or other similar laptops.

I like to know how exactly suspending proceeds in Ubuntu, \n\n\n*\n\n*Is any hardware completely cut from power or their process is just minimized?\n\n*Other than the screen which parts are put on hold or their power is cut off?\n\n*If there is any power consumption when suspended, how can I know how much it is and how long I can expect my laptop to be able to be revived before battery is drained?\n\n*What happens exactly for hard disk and is it safe to carry around the laptop without damaging the hard disk when suspended?\n\n\nA: When a machine goes into the suspend state the kernel freezes (stops) user space programs and kernel threads. Then the kernel will traverse all the devices and calls the suspend methods on each driver. Each driver has the know-how to put the hardware into a deep sleep state (or even power it off) (and the converse to bring it back to a sane running state when the resume occurs).  At this point the hardware should be in a low power state (and hence the Hard Disk will be powered off).\nThe Kernel wakeup code address is written to an address as specified by an ACPI FADT table, then x86 Power Management Control registers are written to; this effectively powers off the processor but keeps memory in a self-refresh mode.\nWhen resume occurs, the CPU is restarted and after a short time in the firmware (BIOS/UEFI) jumps to the wake up address provided by the kernel and the kernel jumps back into protected mode and restores its state. It then traverses the drivers and these resume all the devices. Then frozen processes are thawed and the kernel returns back to user space.\nSo to answer your questions:\n1 and 2: Devices drivers try to put devices into the deepest sleep state, some devices can be powered down, some may be just in the deep sleep state consuming very little power. It depends on the hardware and the device driver.\nMemory is being refreshed, it is never powered off. The CPU is effectively stopped, but it depends on the CPU model on how much of the package is actually fully powered off.\n\n\n*One way to determine how much power is being uses is using the Firmware Test Suite s3power tests; I recommend putting the machine into deep sleep for 30 minutes and measuring battery power drain to get an estimate of power usage during suspend:\n\n\nremove AC power supply, then run:\nsudo apt-get install fwts\nsudo fwts s3power --s3power-sleep-delay=1800\n\n..wait 1800 seconds (30 minutes) and it should power back on and give an estimate.\n\n\n*The hard disk is power off, so the machine is safe to be carried.\n\n", "Q: Usage of Ubuntu in Iran Does anyone know about the legal usage of Ubuntu in US-embargoed countries like Iran?

This way all my emails remained easily accessible, even after creating additional space, that is deleting emails, on my online account.\nHowever, I did not figure out how to achieve the same in Evolution. Since here, when I delete an item though webmail, it directly synchronizes to Evolution also. \nI did consider using the option \"Back up Evolution Data\" but I'm afraid this will only attempt the sync again resulting in the loss of emails. The save to mbox option IMHO doesn't facilitate the easy access I am looking for, and furthermore results in the following error when attempting to save the whole inbox: \"Failed to move message cache file\" without any further specification. The very same error is also shown when I try to copy the inbox folder to a folder \"On This Computer\".\nWhat approach could you advise me, and, if similar to one of the latter approaches I mentioned above; what might solve the error?\n(I did try Google and this board but without luck or while using the wrong search terms)\n\nA: I do not consider this option as ideal, so feel free to comment or answer and get the honor of being the accepted answer. This does however offer me a more convenient solution compared to the options I noted above; which is why I am answering my own question now. \nCopying both the Inbox and the Sent items to a dedicated folder inside \"On This Computer\" allows for easy accessibility and a genuine local copy of the emails. Thus allowing me to have the same accessibility and search-ability with respect to the regular mailbox, even after deleting them from the server.\nThe reason why this is not ideal is that both mailboxes are not automatically synched, that is it is not trivial until where the emails are in the locally stored folder and until where they are still on the server. In other words this approach still involves manual labor.\n", "Q: How to make Gnome's \"Activities\" bar always visible?

All the solutions I've found seem to deal with a different version of ssh-keygen, though I can't figure out what version I have, or what others have.\n\nA: You can use ssh -o FingerprintHash=md5 user@host to use old-school MD5 hashes, or store this in your ~/.ssh/config:\nFingerprintHash md5\n\nYou server is probably using old openssh version which does not support new sha256 hashses.\n\nA: While the accepted answer solves the problem of forcing newer clients to show MD5 hashes, it doesn't specifically solve the problem of forcing a server to show its fingerprint with a specific hash function when calculating fingerprints on the server. To clarify that a bit, when checking fingerprints, you need to match the one shown on the client to the true value on the server. @Jakuje's answer deals with getting the client to use a different hash function, this answer deals with getting the server to show you the hash using a different hash function. It doesn't matter whether you change the server or the client's hash function, just so they're the same.\nTo find a host's fingerprint, on that host execute:\n# Works with the version of OpenSSH on 16.04 but not 14.04\n# (on 14.04 I have OpenSSH_6.6.1p1; on 16.04 it's OpenSSH_7.2p2)\n# Check your version with with `ssh -V`\ncd /etc/ssh\nssh-keygen -l -E md5 -f ssh_host_ecdsa_key.pub\n\nOf course, you can change md5 to any supported hash function, and you may need to change ssh_host_ecdsa_key.pub depending on the key type you're using (e.g. ssh_host_rsa_key.pub).\n", "Q: Is Ubuntu16.04 LTS compatible with HP Pavillion dv6 i7 \n*\n\n*I need to know whether my HP Pavilion dv6 i7 quad core will run Ubuntu 16.04 LTS smoothly?\n\n*Whether it will support all my HP laptop functions and vice versa? \n\n*How resource intensive is Ubuntu 16.04 LTS compared to Windows 8.1?\n\n\nI haven't as yet ever used Ubuntu, but am excited to try, it look spectacular.

It needs a new preset to be able to create these files.\nFirst download and install WinFF, FFmpeg and and an 'expanded' codec pack for FFmpeg fromo the Ubuntu Repositories:\nsudo apt-get install winff winff-doc ffmpeg libavcodec-extra\n\nThen create a text file on your Desktop, or any other location, called hevc.wff and paste the following xml snippet into it:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?>\n<presets> \n  <HEVC>\n    <label>H.265 encoding with AAC sound</label>\n    <params>-c:a aac -b:a 160k -strict -2 -c:v libx265 -preset medium -crf 28</params>\n    <extension>mp4</extension>\n    <category>My Presets</category>\n  </HEVC>\n</presets>\n\nSave the file, right click on it and select: 'Open with WinFF' and this is enough to save your new preset in ~/.winff/presets.xml and make H.265/HEVC encoding possible from within WinFF!\nThe finished product can be seen in this screenshot from my own system:\n\nNotes:\n\n\n*\n\n*You will note from the graphic above that it is an easy matter to modify this preset to extend it as you see fit.\n\n*Extra presets can be conveniently added to the 'My Presets' category as you build up a small library of your own presets!\n\n\nReferences:\n\n\n*\n\n*FFmpeg and H.265 Encoding Guide\n\n*FFmpeg and AAC\n", "Q: Deleted partition - accidentally screwed up other partitions? I am attempting to remove a Debian 8 OS from my computer. I was hoping it'd be as simple as deleting its partition. After I deleted its partition, I ended up with 490GB (/500GB HDD) as \"Free Space.\" Did I make an uh oh??\nI had 8 partitions (I think so because I saw sda8). Located at sda8 was my Deb8 OS, & at sda7, my ubuntu OS. Both sized at half of my HDD's space. I open up Disks and selected sda7. I chose to delete the partition. I was asked for pw to make changes. I was left with below...\n\nMy goal was to remove my SteamOS (Deb8) partition, and adding the space it had taken up to ubuntu.\n\nA: So, I ended up having to reinstall both OSes from Live USB. (Ubuntu was very convenient to setup after SteamOS found its home on my SDD.) \nLet the trouble I went through convince others to read manuals!\n", "Q: How to resize disk partitions? This is a link to my disk partition image.\n\nI want to increase the size of my ext4 disk by around 20-30 GB. I want to use the free space in my /dev/sda2 or /dev/sda3 or /dev/sda5 to increase my ext4 size. Please tell me how to do this in detail.   \n\nA: You can use gparted to move & resize your partitions. If you're going to be working on your root partition ie. \"mounted at /\" you'll need to make a livecd or bootable usb drive to boot into gparted.\nMore info can be found in this guide.\nEdit: Now that your image link is working, I can be a little more clear. If you were to shrink and move to the right your sda5 partition that will add to the amount of unallocated space between sda7 and sda5. \nBeing that you're going to be working on your root parition, you'll need to do it from a gparted live usb. \nOnce you've shrunk sda5 to the right, you can drag the boundary of sda7 to the right, using that unallocated space to make it bigger. \n", "Q: Ralink RT3290 WiFi card not working on Ubuntu 16.04 I recently installed Ubuntu 16.04 on a computer with a Ralink RT3290 wireless network card. After working fine for a day, the card just stopped working.  Apparently, the card is no longer supported in Linux so the only official drivers available are very old.\nI have tried following the answers to this question,\nthis question and this question - even tried getting modified drivers from one of the commenters to get the driver to compile on the newer kernels (4.4.0 here). None of it worked.\ndmesg reveals the following:\nrt2800_wait_wpdma_ready: Error - WPDMA TX/RX busy [0x00000068]\nrt2800_wait_wpdma_ready: Error - WPDMA TX/RX busy [0x00000068]\nrt2800pci_set_device_state: Error - Device failed to enter state 4 (-5)\n\nThe card shows up when I do lspci:\nNetwork controller: Ralink corp.

After reviewing the operations listed, you can then decide whether you really want these things to happen or not.\n\nSo it will also show you what other programs will do to your files, not only mv.\nmaybe needs Python to run, but that should not be a problem.

It can handle multiple source files/directories, too. Use it the same way you would use mv - mvsim source... dest.

I have Ubuntu 12.04 LTS. I am considering upgrading to Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. I already read a similar post about it: Is it necessary to upgrade to 14.04 LTS or can I stand in 12.04 LTS forever with no problem?\nHowever, the answers in that post do not say if applications need to be reinstalled after upgrading.\nIn particular, I am about to install Matlab R2016a on Ubuntu, for the first time. If I wait until next year to upgrade to Ubuntu 14.04, will I need to reinstall Matlab at that point, when I upgrade? \nBecause if I do, then I should upgrade now, before I install Matlab and put one year of setups and adjustments on it, which I will lose if I have to reinstall it when I upgrade to 14.04.\nIf I don't, I'd rather wait one more year to upgrade until 12.04 will run out of support in April 2017, so I will get the newest possible LTS version of Ubuntu.\nSince I am using Ubuntu on a MacBook Pro (using a firmware called re-fit) I had to install and configure a driver called MTRACK which makes Ubuntu 12.04 responsive to the touchpad of the MacBook Pro laptop in a humanly possible way (it took me quite some time to do it). \n[These are links about MTRACK:\nhttp://bryansiegel.com/2013/05/fix-the-crappy-touchpad-behavior-when-using-ubuntu-13-04-on-a-macbook-pro/\nhttps://github.com/BlueDragonX/xf86-input-mtrack/blob/master/README.md]\nSo again: if I upgrade to Ubuntu 14.04, will the MTRACK installation and settings be preserved or will I need to reinstall MTRACK after upgrading from Ubuntu 12.04 LTS to Ubuntu 14.04 LTS?\n\nA: I have no experience with running mentioned software on Ubuntu but my overall experience is following:\nThere is basically no need for reinstalling a software after system upgrade unless it gets unmet dependencies. In that case you’ll need to upgrade such software. This may happen to Matlab as it is not installed using APT. However, Matlab R2016a supports Ubuntu 14.04 and not 12.04 (thanks @edwinksl for the link), so you should upgrade Ubuntu before installing Matlab if you’ve done none of these changes yet. Ubuntu 14.04 LTS has been out for 2 years already and should be mature enough.\nIf the installed software or users have made any changes to system configuration (/etc mostly), Ubuntu installer will ask if you wish to keep, overwrite or merge such changes.

Thanks!\n\nA: You could try the Unetbootin route; see this post to create the USB image on the website rather than on your machine. \n", "Q: Is Ubuntu 16.04 good for gaming? Is it recommended to use Ubuntu for gaming?\nSeriously, I need to know if it worth the effort of installing Ubuntu on my PC.\nI have a system with the following configuration: i7 2600, 8GB ram DDR3, SSD, Nvidia GTX970 MSI 4GB.\n\nA: Yes, Ubuntu is worth the effort of installing on your PC, because it is very solid, secure and user-friendly. But Linux generally and Ubuntu particularly, is not the main target of PC games producers. Not yet, anyway. So there is a chance that your favourite games may not be available on Linux (although, we have to mention that there are several games playable only on Ubuntu).\nSo, if you want a final answer, here is mine: Do a dual-boot. On one partition, install a minimal Windows with some good security programs. On the other partition, install Ubuntu. Use Windows for gaming and Ubuntu for the rest of your activities. And thus you can have it all.\nDid I said that this is my final answer? Oh, but no! Ubuntu is evolving. One day you will not need that Windows partition anymore! \n\nA: \n\"seriously, i need to know if it worth the effort of install ubuntu on my pc.\"\n\nYou could at least put effort into your question and specify what exactly you want to play. There are thousands of games out there. \nYou want a final answer? No.\nBut only because you asked whether it's recommended and I doubt anyone would speak out a general recommendation in this context today. It really depends what you want to do with Ubuntu. If you are going to install Steam, chances are many of your favourite games have already been ported to Linux, including all Valve titles. CS:Go runs really fine, so do all related titles. I'm confident that with Valve's efforts to steer clear from Microsoft and its Windows Market, Linux will play a significant role in gaming over the next few years. \nBlizzard games on the other hand have not been ported and there are no known plans for doing so. \nAs for EA's Origin, there is also no official Ubuntu implementation.\n", "Q: Kubuntu upgrade from 15.10 to 16.04 failed Some time ago I triggered upgrade from Kubuntu 15.10 to 16.04 and it failed (I forgot why and with what message). When I issued sudo do-release-upgrade it failed with message:\nE: The value 'wily' is invalid for APT::Default-Release as such a release is not available in the sources\nFull log-output (with errors): -> paste.ubuntu.com \nThen I tried sudo apt-get autoclean but it failed with similar message. So I decided to revert /etc/apt/sources.list with command sudo cp /etc/apt/sources.list.distUpgrade /etc/apt/sources.list, then I did sudo apt-get update and repeated release upgrade. Unfortunately it failed with the same result...\nHow should I fix this?\n\nA: There is a much simpler way to achieve the upgrade: \n1st goto -> Software Sources -> Updates\nThere is a field that allows the system to check for new versions:\nLTS only / any / never. Select \"any\" LTS will only be available with 16.04.1 Just remember to set it back to LTs before Oct.2016 if it's not in your nature to go in sync with every new release of (K)Ubuntu.\nThen open the update-manager from the menu. After you have checked for updates, it will inform you about the availibility of a system-upgrade.\nIt's always recommended to read the Release-Notes beforehand for \"Known issues\". You find them in 7. Further information. It may also be a good idea to look at the Ubuntu-RN as this gives the underlying system, like drivers.\nIn case you are not certain if your sources.list is messed up right now:\nYou can easily reset the sources-list to it's origin without touching it with editor, as this was identified mainly to be a cause of errors.\nkdesudo software-properties-kde\nThis will raise a GUI-window, with a reset-button in the left-bottom corner(+ other option). What does this button? It retrieves the most current list of standard-sources via Internet connection from Canonical.\nAs in the log-list you have offered the term vivid appears, you are requesting an impossible solution. Vivid is not on the standard servers as it is EOL (End of life cycle).\n\nA: Error E: The value 'wily' is invalid for APT::Default-Release as such a release is not available in the sources occured during repositories reconfiguration. It was caused by content of /etc/apt/apt.conf where wily was set instead of xenial.\nI changed this file's content to APT::Default-Release \"xenial\"; and next upgrade attempt finished successfully.\n", "Q: Is it possible to have full hard drive access with a snap? As I understand it, a snap has to declare which interfaces it needs access to and it is confined to those.\nLooking at:\nhttps://developer.ubuntu.com/en/snappy/guides/interfaces/\nthere is no option for full system access. \nI can appreciate that the secure confinement is very important, but I am looking to use snaps as an easy distribution mechanism for duplicity backup, which needs to be able to read all system files to back them up and write access to wherever the user wants the archive files saved.\nI know that this is not the primary use case for snaps, but now that they can be used on multiple distributions and solve dependency issues, I'm exploring the idea as an alternative to having to generate all the different variants of our package.\nWould we be able to bend snaps to our will, or is the format not really suitable for things that need that much access?\n\nA: Yes, what you want is an interface that grants full access to a disk, and it's reasonable for such an interface to exist. It would not be an auto-connecting interface, in that either the user or the person who makes a device with the snap would need to explicitly tell the snap system to allow that connection to take place, but the interface itself is a reasonable request.\nIf you're game I'd suggest you work up a patch for snapd which we will shepherd into the code.\n\nA: Since I posted my question, Snapcraft has gained a new confinement option: \"classic\".\nFrom: https://docs.snapcraft.io/snap-confinement\n\nClassic\n  Allows access to your system’s resources in much the same way\n  traditional packages do. To safeguard against abuse, publishing a\n  classic snap requires manual approval, and installation requires the\n  --classic command line argument.\n\nDuplicity now has classic confinement approved and we have started building snaps in that way.\n(See also: https://github.com/snapcore/snapd/pull/6436 which is about potentially adding a new interface for backup applications that only require read access to the whole filesystem.)\n\nA: You can do this; you're essentially asking for your snap to be unconfined, which you get when installing a snap in devmode:\nsudo snap install --devmode <snap>\n\nYou can still upload devmode snaps to the store, but they're a little more limited in how you share them with people (e.g. you can't place them in stable channels).\n", "Q: D drive not showing My hard disk which under Windows 7 was separated into 2 partitions: C (system part) and D. I keep my movies, music and files on D and use C for installed programs. When I installed Ubuntu 16.04, I selected free space partition as Linux's system directory. After installation however, the D partition completely disappeared. I can still see my C, but D is not visible on Windows and Linux. In Windows' disk manager, it is showing some 293 GB unallocated space, while on Linux it shows as a Linux filesystem. I am very much worried about my data which was on D. I want my data back. I can't understand what's going on and will be really thankful for any replies. \nHere's a screenshot if it helps somehow:\n\n\nA: Looks like you formatted your msdos d partition into a ext4 filesystem when you installed Ubuntu, unless you remember setting up another partition specifically to install Ubuntu into when you were installing?\n", "Q: how to delete particular number or letter before an symbols (|) using grep command I have N number of sequence in a file like this \n>668|CAX10446 conserved hypothetical protein \nMSIRGVGGNGNSRIPSHNGDGSNRRSQNTKNKVEDRVRSLYSSRSNENRESPYAVVDVSSMIESTPTSGE\nTTRASRGVFSRFQRGLGRVADKVRRAVQRAWSSVSIRRSSATRATESRSSSRTARGASSGYKEYSPSAAR\n\n>669|CAX10447 conserved protein \nMSIRGVGGNGNSRIPSHNGDGSNRRSQNTKNKVEDRVRSLYSSRSNENRESPYAVVDVSSMIESTPTSGE\nTTRASRGVFSRFQRGLGRVADKVRRAVQRAWSSVSIRRSSATRATESRSSSRTARGASSGYKEYSPSAAR\n\nor like this\n>gi|76167242|gb|AAX50250.1| hypothetical protein CTA_0001 \nMSIRGVGGNGNSRIPSHNGDGSNRRSQNTKNKVEDRVRSLYSSRSNENRESPYAVVDVSSMIESTPTSGE\nTTRASRGVFSRFQRGLGRVADKVRRAVQRAWSSVSIRR\n\nNow, I need a grep command to delete a particular word or number in first line.\nOutput should be:\n>CAX10446 conserved hypothetical protein \nMSIRGVGGNGNSRIPSHNGDGSNRRSQNTKNKVEDRVRSLYSSRSNENRESPYAVVDVSSMIESTPTSGE\nTTRASRGVFSRFQRGLGRVADKVRRAVQRAWSSVSIRRSSATRATESRSSSRTARGASSGYKEYSPSAAR\n\nor\n>AAX50250.1| hypothetical protein CTA_0001 [Chlamydia trachomatis A/HAR-13]\nMSIRGVGGNGNSRIPSHNGDGSNRRSQNTKNKVEDRVRSLYSSRSNENRESPYAVVDVSSMIESTPTSGE\nTTRASRGVFSRFQRGLGRVADKVRRAVQRAWSSVSIRRSSATRAAESRS\nSSRTARGASSGYREYSPSAAR\n\nI need a grep command to do this action, I used sed but it removed the first line, the ID, so it's difficult to identify which sequence is which. \n\nA: It looks like you want to remove everything before the last | character.

This will remove the | from AAX50250.1|.

client, from https://github.com/Ubuntu-Solutions-Engineering/maasclient. That client returns data from queries in BSON format.\nTo parse BSON output, use the Python BSON package: https://github.com/py-bson/bson\nHere's how you'd read the data in your case:\nimport bson\n\nresp = self.client.get(u\"nodes/%s/\" % node_id, \"details\")\ndata = bytes(rest.read(), \"utf8\")\nnode_details = bson.loads(data)\n\nNOTE: I'd like to update this answer with an example, which will need to wait until my MAAS 2.0 installation is updated.\nIf you'd rather not get BSON, then you should look at using the simple MAAS client which is currently bundled with MAAS itself. I'll also update the answer with details on that.\n", "Q: How can I fit the Ubuntu desktop to the screen in VirtualBox?

During today's software update in Ubuntu the system hangs on. After reboot I see grub shell. I boot the system from USB stick (Xubuntu 14.04) and run Boot Repair. The log is here (I tried to deactivate the [Backup and rename Windows EFI files] option either with no difference). Now after reboot I see Shim UEFI key management tool. Firstly it has full screen mode, then after timer expires for the first time its window shrinks a little bit (presumably, goes to 800x600 resolution). Each time after timer expires Shims' window blinks once and restarts the timer. \nWhat should I do to come to Grub boot menu? I don't see any keys to add in Shim's window. Do I have to create one? Any way to avoid this (don't want to waste my time on this)? Also I have Secure Boot disabled in my BIOS (if this info helps). I tried to enable it and saw no difference.\n\nA: I have two thoughts on this:\nFilesystem damage\nSome EFIs are highly sensitive to filesystem damage, which might make it look as if a new GRUB binary was improperly signed. This would then trigger the MokManager display you've shown. (It's not technically Shim that's showing that display, but MokManager.) In this case, you may be able to fix the problem by doing:\nsudo dosfsck /dev/sda2\n\nYou'll need to do that from an Ubuntu emergency disk, of course. Also, this type of damage can occur if you failed to both disable Fast Startup and disable hibernation. Thus, it's important that you disable these Windows features to prevent a recurrence.\nNote also that if the filesystem is damaged, you might need to re-install GRUB -- but do so after fixing the filesystem problem. Boot Repair should be able to help with this.\nA new bug\nIt could be there's been a recent update to Shim and/or GRUB that's causing it to flake out on your particular computer. In this case, reverting to the old version may help. This may require copying the shimx64.efi binary from another computer or re-installing GRUB in some way. Alternatively, if the bug is in GRUB, you could install another boot manager entirely. I describe several on this page. I haven't noticed any recent updates to either Shim or GRUB, but I may have missed something.\nWith Secure Boot off, you can bypass Shim entirely by creating a new boot entry with a command like this:\nsudo efibootmgr -c -d /dev/sda -p 2 -l \\\\EFI\\\\ubuntu\\\\grubx64.efi -L GRUB\n\nThis command tells the computer to boot via grubx64.efi on partition 2 (-p 2) of /dev/sda (-d /dev/sda). Your current setup boots via Shim, which is necessary to handle Secure Boot; but with that feature disabled, a direct call to GRUB can bypass any Secure Boot flakiness -- assuming there's nothing wrong with the GRUB binary. As noted earlier, if that binary is damaged, it could create the symptoms you're seeing, and this procedure would not help -- the system would simply fail to boot in some other way.\n\nA: Try running Boot Repair again, but this time make sure \"Secure Boot\" (under the \"GRUB Options\" tab) is checked.\n", "Q: Determine Ubuntu version on SDD using Live CD I have Ubuntu installed on my SSD but unable to boot to it after a SSD-to-SSD clone. I want to repair/reinstall Grub, but I don't recall the version of Ubuntu I had installed.\nSo I have booted with a Ubuntu v15.04 Live CD after selecting Try Ubuntu, but I'm fairly certain my SSD version is not v15.04 - maybe it is v15.10.\nHow can I find the Ubuntu version on the SSD after booting with a Live CD?\n\nA: You could mount your root partition that is on your SSD (usually double clicking the drive icon from the desktop or file manager). If you see multiple partitions/drives you may need to mount them all to find the correct one (the one with the etc folder).\nOpen the etc folder and from there open the lsb-release file. This will contain the distribution information.\nE.g. from your root partition if you execute cat etc/lsb-release you will see:\nDISTRIB_ID=Ubuntu\nDISTRIB_RELEASE=14.04\nDISTRIB_CODENAME=trusty\nDISTRIB_DESCRIPTION=\"Ubuntu 14.04.4 LTS\"\n\n", "Q: How to run my C programs with the Bourne Shell?

I did use it to install my printer drivers according to the directions on the HP Linux Imaging and Printing page.\n\nA: Running sh [Program Name] instructs the sh program to execute a shell\nscript named [Program Name] so if this file is a C program, the command will fail.\nThe POSX specification for sh, the standard command language interpreter states that the argument for sh should be the “pathname of a file containing commands”.\n\nA: Typing sh program_name assumes that program_name is a shell script and executes the script (so it must be in a sh/bash language).\nIf Fortune_Teller_5000 is a binary file (a Compiled C program, or even C source code), running sh Fortune_Teller_5000 will not work as expected.\nHere are 2 ways you could do it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Type sh then ENTER, and then type ./Fortune_Teller_5000 (you may need to cd into the proper directory)\n\n*Type sh -c ./Fortune_Teller_5000 or sh -c /path/to/folder/Fortune_Teller_5000\n", "Q: ubuntu can't Mount the other partition of my drive I have Ubuntu 16.04 alongside Windows 10.i have a partition of personal files.why does Ubuntu says \"unable to mount .....maybe Windows was hibernated or has auto fast-booting \"\nPlease i need help.\n\nA: Windows 10 has fast startup enabled by default. This saves the RAM to the disk. Ubuntu will not mount the Windows partition when it is in this state because it could cause Windows to err when booting.\nTo disable fast startup, go to Control Panel > Hardware and sound > Change what the Power Buttons Do (under Power Options) and click Change settings that are currently unavailable, uncheck Fast Startup, and reboot to Ubuntu.\nThis will notably slow your Windows boot time, as Windows will boot from a cold start every time.\n\nA: Here is how I fixed mine. \nopen terminal and enter this command \nsudo ntfsfix /dev/sdXY \n\nreplace the XY according to your partiton..

Can you explain me why it does not support locking the icon to the launcher? while other apps let me to do so. \n\nA: Use the command described by @JonasCz. \"Tools\" > \"Create desktop entry / launcher\"\nThen go to unity, search for DataGrip and drag it to the bar. \nI don't know why pinning it doesn't work but the above worked for me. I imagine it has to do with pining the shortcut vs the running java app. The shortcut is probably a wrapper to start the main app.  \n", "Q: Is it possible to uninstall sh? This may sound silly but I want to uninstall sh (for research purposes) and replace it with my own shell. Is this actually possible? \nMany scripts and programs seem to have it hardcoded in, so I'm in doubt as to its viability.\n\nA: \n⚠️ WARNING! PLEASE READ BEFORE RUNNING ANY COMMANDS! ⚠️\nThis answer is only provided for research and to further knowledge of Ubuntu Linux. Running any commands in this answer may very well destroy your system entirely. Make sure you're in a VM or a backup. I am not responsible if you break your system.\n\nThe command sh is provided by dash, by way of a symlink:\n$ ll /bin/sh\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 4 Jun  1 08:33 /bin/sh -> dash*\n\n$ which sh\n/bin/sh\n\n$ dpkg -S /bin/dash\ndash: /bin/dash\n\n$ dpkg -S /bin/sh\ndiversion by dash from: /bin/sh\ndiversion by dash to: /bin/sh.distrib\ndash: /bin/sh\n\nTo remove it, run the below command:\nsudo apt remove dash\n\nAPT will kick you back with the following error message:\nYou are about to do something potentially harmful.\nTo continue type in the phrase 'Yes, do as I say!'\n\nIf you are really willing to destroy your system, type that in and press Return.\nUbuntu will then uninstall bash, lightdm, and the ubuntu-desktop meta-package (as well as all packages that depend on those three), because they all have a dependency on dash. Unless your current shell works perfectly, your system will be unusable after you kill the last instance of bash or dash.\nIf you actually follow through with this command, the only way to restore the proper files is to boot into a Live CD and re-install the packages through a chrooted recovery session. \nIf you're really lucky, you might still be able to repair your system live by re-installing the packages, provided you still have a root shell open. Systems have recovered from worse before, but luck really needs to be on your side for that.\n\nInstead, I would suggest you re-make the /bin/sh symlink to point to your shell. In that case, you can just restore back to dash if something goes really really wrong. Do this by running these commands:\nsudo -s\ncd /bin\nrm sh\nln -s /path/to/your/shell sh\nchmod 777 sh\n\nRestore back to dash by repeating these steps, but specifying dash instead of your own shell. Or just run sudo apt install --reinstall dash. You might need to specify a custom init to do this.\n\nA: I would install your own shell alongside SH. Uninstalling SH is a VERY bad idea, as numerous programs and scripts rely on it.\n\nA: Fast forward a few years, and yes, sh can be uninstalled and made to work, but only in single-application scenarios, such as dedicated docker containers, not in universal multi-application systems.\nFor instance it has been used by Google in their distroless containers. Some apps can be copied there (having been installed in a more complete system, e.g. Debian at an earlier stage, using a two-stage docker build), complete with all their shared dependencies identified using ldd (as long as they do not depend on *sh or xterm).\n", "Q: How can I insert a greek letter in Dia diagram software?

So they require HID_QUIRK_ALWAYS_POLL (0x00000400) or the gpm service to be enabled to function properly.\nBasics: https://github.com/sriemer/fix-linux-mouse\nIf you could test kernel boot parameter usbhid.quirks=0x04ca:0x0061:0x00000400, then I could prepare the patch for the upstream Linux kernel.

Now when I boot up I see the Grub boot menu, but I see several entries I hadn't seen before the clone. I've tried booting Ubuntu and Windows Boot Manager (on /dev/sda1) and both of them boot up successfully.\nThe entries I don't recognize are Windows UEFI bootmgfw.efi and EFI/*.\nI run Windows 10 and Ubuntu 15.10 which are mostly what I'm interested in, but maybe there is some importance to the EFI options?\nAlso, I don't ever recall seeing the System Setup entry.\nDoes anyone recognize these and have an opinion as to whether I should keep all of these entries or remove them? Eventually I want Windows to be the default. I suspect System Setup may be the Windows or Dell Recovery Partition, but I haven't ran it yet so I don't know.\nI just want to clean up the menu and get rid of unneeded entries as well as set Grub to default to Windows. Also, where are these boot options configured?\nAny help is appreciated. Thx.\n\n\nA: This is perfectly normal; it's happened to me on many UEFI computers. The boot*.efi entries and the Windows Boot UEFI Loader one should all boot Windows. MokManager.efi is for managing Secure Boot keys. You probably won't ever use it, but you probably want to keep it around just in case you end up needing it. The System setup entry actually boots into BIOS setup, not a recovery partition.\nGrub Customizer is a good program to remove the duplicate Windows entries. You can install it from its PPA and run it with these commands:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:danielrichter2007/grub-customizer\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install grub-customizer\ngrub-customizer\n\nNote that \"removing\" an entry only hides it; you can restore it later if you, for whatever reason, need it back.\nTo set Windows as the default OS, just move its entry to the top; it will boot after (by default) 10 seconds, unless you select a different OS.\n", "Q: Ssh to target host via gateway Have a HostA that located in internal subnet which could be seen only from gatway host.

"Q: How to change directory permission from read-write to read-only I'm an elementary-os user and I recently installed XAMPP to practice PHP. At first, I had to give read-write permission to /opt/lampp/htdocs/, in order to create the project files.   \nBut accidentally, I have given read-write permission to /opt/lampp/ instead of /opt/lampp/htdocs/. I used following command.\n$ sudo chmod -R 0777 /opt/lampp/  \n\nNow, when I tried to go to phpMyAdmin in browser it says, Wrong permissions on configuration file, should not be world writable! \nI'm guessing, changing the directory's permission to it's default state (read-only) will solve this. I tried googling but couldn't find any working solution. Please help!\n\nA: Relying on my own Google-fu, I was able to find this that describes your issue similarly.\nTry the following:\nchmod 755 -R /opt/lampp/phpmyadmin\n\nTo fix the permissions of phpmyadmin.\n", "Q: Is it safe to revoke group other access to every directory in a file system? I'm trying to secure an account on our server called ssh_user that is used purely for connecting via SSH to our server.  Everyone on our team logs into this account via a PSK secured ssh connection and tunnels to a specific port for our version control system.  Security is maintained by everyone having their own PSK in the file /etc/ssh/ssh_user/authorized_users\nThe ssh_user account was created with sudo adduser -r -s /bin/sh ssh_user as to make the user a system account, with no home directory and as limited of a shell as possible.\nAlthough these are already trusted users, the concern is always there of what access this account really needs, because I can still list directories in the root file system through this account, and read config files under /etc/ssh/..., so I'm wondering if this issue is as easy as issuing revoking all access to the group \"others\" across the entire filesystem with sudo chmod go-rwx /* ? I don't however know what (if anything) this would break on a default Ubuntu 16.04 install.\nI'm by no means an expert at linux or security, and I'm not trying to pretend to know what I'm doing, so any input is greatly appreciated.\nThanks!\n\nA: Repeat after me: Running ANY permission command on / without knowing exactly what you're doing is a great way to break your system. Even if you know what you're doing, it's still probably the wrong thing to do.\nIn your case, the command won't work because it's the wrong one to start. Secondly, groups are a very valid Linux construct of users, and blocking off groups from accessing files is a really really bad idea.\nIf I'm understanding your case properly, you want to block users from resources that they aren't authorized to read. Fortunately for you, there are a few ways to do this, each with tradeoffs.  \n\nOption 1: No Shell At All (Best way)\n\nYou're using SSH to allow users to tunnel into a secure server, right? Why do users even need a shell in this case? Just block their access to the shell, and only let them tunnel!\nTo do this, simply create a new group called noaccess or similar. Then, copy and paste the below into your /etc/ssh/sshd_config file:\nMatch Group noaccess\n    AllowTcpForwarding yes\n    X11Forwarding no\n\nIf you want to be even more secure by restricting where they can tunnel, you can add the parameter PermitOpen to the SSH config. For example, if you want to only allow users to forward to port 1337 on the current server, you would add PermitOpen localhost:1337 to your config file, right under the AllowTcpForwarding directive, like so:\nMatch Group noaccess\n    AllowTcpForwarding yes \n    PermitOpen localhost:1337\n    X11Forwarding no\n    ...\n\nFinally, set the shell of the users to /bin/true by running the command chsh -s /bin/true <username>. Users will be silently (and forcefully) kicked back if they try to start any sort of interactive session. If you want to include a \"friendly\" error message, you can create a quick-n-dirty \"fake\" shell that will spit back an error message.\nSSH gets rather annoyed when it can't access a shell, so you need to pass the command-line argument -N to the OpenSSH command, like so:\nssh user@example.com -N -L 3307:localhost:3306\n\nIf you're using PuTTY, make sure the highlighted checkbox is selected:\n\nI've gone ahead and made a really simple (untested) shell that spits back an error message, and also keeps the terminal window open so that -N is unnecessary. You can find the source here if you want to compile and use it. Even with this, you should still use -N, but it's no longer absolutely necessary.\n\nOption 2: Let them be\n\nUsers in Linux already have a pretty acceptable permission set. They can read files that are relevant to them and are important for the functionality of the system. At the same time, files that are \"protected\" (like private keys and /etc/shadow) already disallow reads from unauthorized users.\n\nIf your users are trustworthy already (and are actually going to be working on your system), this is the best option -- at the cost of keeping users out of where they don't belong\n\nOption 3: Selective Targeting\n\nIf Option 2 is still too insecure for your needs, you can chmod o-rwx files that you don't want them to access. Examples of these include \"secure\" config files. However, you must be very careful that you don't cause services and applications to lose access to files that are needed to do their job.\nYou could also use Access Control Lists to block groups of users off of files, without setting them as the owning group. I caution, however, that this is fairly involved, and it opens up a way to allow users to \"escape\" their confined set if they find a shelled user that isn't in the blocked group.\n\nOption 4: chroot\n\nUsing chroot allows you to control exactly what your users have access to. You decide what permissions, what commands, and so on. This is a very involved method that needs a lot of work to get working right, so it's not recommended for everyone.\nIf you're interested, this question explains it rather well.\n\nA: Running\nsudo chmod go-rwx /*\n\nwould only allow root to access anything on your system which would break about everything.\nSee Simple & easy way to jail users for soem better ways to restrict what a user can do.\n", "Q: Can't install Ubuntu Minimal on ThinkPad T450s I'm trying to install 16.04 Ubuntu Mate using the mini.iso on a ThinkPad T450s.

First, the dot symbol key is not working, so I have to use the dot key from the numeric keypad. Secondly, the right alt key is a shortcut for mute speaker volume although I deleted all multi media short cuts in the system settings/keyboard. Thirdly, on the 12.04 LTS version and with english language option selected I was able to type german characters while pressing the right Alt key + q,y,p for ä,ü,ö. This was very convenient, because I did not have to switch to German language. This feature does not work any longer, because the right Alt key is now mute speaker volume and I can't change it. I appreciate your help and thank you.\n\nA: Assuming you are talking about English (US, international with dead keys), that keyboard layout turns the quotation symbol key to a dead_diaeresis key for typing e.g. ë. To type the quotation symbol you need to press both <AltGr> and <Shift>.\nThe dot key should be unchanged, though.\nYou can see an overview of the currently selected keyboard layout by clicking the input source indicator in the menu and selecting Keyboard Layout Chart.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 16.04 & 2016 Razer Blade 14\" Display Issues For starters, I am quite new to Ubuntu.

There are a few remaining issues, but the only ones that irk me are related to display. I know everyone will want more information, and I'm happy to supply once I know what you'll want to see. But for starters:\nRazer Blade 2016 14\"\nDual-Booted w/ Windows 10\nUEFI Secure Boot is still on my Bios\nI am using the newest version of Nouveau Drivers\nSo the remaining problems are that I cannot change resolution size, nor can I suspend my laptop. I have attempted to install both Nvidia 364 and 367 - both led to black screens and one time to a login loop. When I did those, I believe I had also uninstalled my desktop and reinstalled it on someones advice. The resolution is quite annoying at this high of a resolution, as some things wont scale manually and I can barely see them. And suspend would be nice.\nMy fear is that I use Linux for work right now and can't have it crap out on me if I attempt to sort this out. I've been contemplating trying Bumblebee. My main concern is that I might be damaging my video card or my integrated graphics. I also understand from forums about this computer and linux on Razers website that battery is crap without sorting out driver issues, but I have yet to need to be mobile with this.\nAny help would be appreciated!\n\nA: I got linux mint 18(beta) with cinnamon to work on my razer blade 2016.\nIt works fine except for suspend. I can watch youtube/twitch for more than 3 hours without changing any settings.\nAFAIK, people have not figured out a perfect soln for the suspend. Personally, I set my laptop to do nothing when lid closed. As for the nvidia driver, since I use linux for work, I am happy with the integrated graphics card. Also, from what I know, even for those who kinda get their nvidia card to work, there is some tearing and lagging when they watch videos. \nI think we need to just wait for a perfect out-of-the-box soln.\nCurrently I am waiting for the new 4.7 kernel update since I think they fixed a bunch in 4.6\nGreat, 11 hours ago they just announced the official release of linux mint 18.

This is because of the mismatch in type of OS and the software being opened/run.\nType in the command\nuname -m\n\nIf you get i686, you have a 32-bit version of Linux. \nIf you get x86_64, you have a 64-bit version of Linux.\nSo now install the same version of the software that you want to use. Or also check the dependencies that the software uses.\nFor instance you have a 32bit OS.

My other two (working) monitors, both 1080p, connect through HDMI and DVI.\n\nEdit: I ran xrandr, and here's the output:\nScreen 0: minimum 8 x 8, current 3840 x 1080, maximum 16384 x 16384\nDVI-I-0 disconnected primary (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)\nDVI-I-1 connected 1920x1080+0+0 (normal left inverted right x axis y axis) 509mm x 286mm\n   1920x1080     60.00*+\n   1680x1050     59.95  \n   1440x900      59.89  \n   1280x1024     75.02    60.02  \n   1280x960      60.00  \n   1280x800      59.81  \n   1280x720      60.00  \n   1152x864      75.00  \n   1024x768      75.03    70.07    60.00  \n   800x600       75.00    72.19    60.32    56.25  \n   640x480       75.00    59.94  \nDP-0 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)\nHDMI-0 connected 1920x1080+1920+0 (normal left inverted right x axis y axis) 509mm x 286mm\n   1920x1080     60.00*+  59.94    50.00    60.00    50.04  \n   1680x1050     59.95  \n   1440x900      59.89  \n   1280x1024     75.02    60.02  \n   1280x960      60.00  \n   1280x800      59.81  \n   1280x720      60.00    59.94    50.00  \n   1152x864      75.00  \n   1024x768      75.03    70.07    60.00  \n   800x600       75.00    72.19    60.32    56.25  \n   720x576       50.00  \n   720x480       59.94  \n   640x480       75.00    59.94    59.93  \n   480x576       50.00  \n   480x480       59.94  \nDP-1 connected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)\n   3840x2160     60.00 +  29.98  \n   2560x1440     59.95  \n   1920x1200     59.88  \n   1920x1080     60.00    59.94    50.00    23.97    60.00    50.04  \n   1680x1050     59.95  \n   1600x1200     60.00  \n   1280x1024     75.02    60.02  \n   1280x800      59.81  \n   1280x720      60.00    59.94    50.00  \n   1152x864      75.00  \n   1024x768      75.03    60.00  \n   800x600       75.00    60.32  \n   720x576       50.00    50.08  \n   720x480       59.94    60.05  \n   640x480       75.00    59.94    59.93\n\nNotably, \"DP-0 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)\" (DP would be Display Port - meaning that my 4k display port monitor is not connected). Interestingly enough, there is a DP-1 option which is connected.\nI also ran arandr, but like my i3-wm, it only recognized the 1080p monitors. I find it very strange that xrandr detects a monitor (connected through DP-1) that arandr doesn't.\n\nA: After some poking, I got my configuration to work.\nFirst, I had to reboot my computer. I don't know why that was necessary, but apparently it was.\nThe next time I ran arandr, I noticed that there was now a DP-1 entry that I could click on: (I suspected that this would be the case, since xrandr's output indicated that there was a connected DP-1 monitor)\n\nWhen I expanded the DP-1 option, I was able to click \"Active\", and my third monitor turned on successfully.\n\nAs a final step, I selected \"Save As\", saved my settings in an automatically generated file which I called layout.sh, and then followed the directions in the highest voted (not the accepted) answer to this post.\nP.S. I didn't exactly follow the instructions in the post's answer. My actual /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf file looks like:\n[Seat:*]\nautologin-guest=false\nautologin-user=my_user_name\nautologin-user-timeout=0\ndisplay-setup-script=/path/to/layout.sh\nsession-setup-script=/path/to/layout.sh\n\nas opposed to the suggestion in the post:\n[SeatDefaults]\ngreeter-session=unity-greeter\nuser-session=ubuntu\n# for your login screen, e.g. LightDM (Ubuntu 11.10) or GDM (11.04 or earlier)\ndisplay-setup-script=/path/to/layout.sh\n# for your desktop session\nsession-setup-script=/path/to/layout.sh\n\nI think the new format of lightdm.conf comes with Ubuntu 15.10 and onwards (I'm using Ubuntu 16.04 - the version number claim is a guess based on the difference noted on this site).\nP.P.S. I also changed some settings between the \"Active\" and \"Save Configuration\" steps - such as rotating my third monitor and moving it to the place it physically is relative to my other two monitors on my desk.\n", "Q: Problems installing and booting 16.04 on new laptop I have a brand new, out of the box Lenovo Thinkpad 11e. I've installed 16.04 LTS using a USB, though I had to do this via the desktop of the 'try Ubuntu without installing' option as the screen would freeze on the regular install option. Now it's installed though, I'm having similar problems when trying to boot or shut down/restart (the screen will freeze, though it will boot eventually). I've ran all the updates, but that's not helped either. I've tried reinstalling, but the screen also freezes when trying both install options on the USB.\nI've installed Ubuntu on multiple systems in the past and have never had a problem. Please help.\n\nA: Lee, I feel your pain. I wanted to upgrade too 16.04LTS, but have since resigned myself to just upgrading the kernel too 4.4.x, which with the 14.04LTS already installed worked excellently.

How can I get the application names to show in german on the overview?\n\nA: When I looked, I saw a mix of German and English.

I have the option \"limit scrollback to\" unchecked. Some times it scrolls back some times it does not. Then I realized it does not scroll back when ever I use clear command. It scrolls back only one scree.\nI use clear a lot(almost once in every 3 commands).\nThe man page for clear points to terminfo. \nThere are some options on terminfo but I can't find a config file where I can define the options. \nAll the files under /lib/terminfo/ from where clear seems to be reading its config are in compiled format and I do not understand them. \nI didn't see this issue with earlier to 14.04(guessing).\nAny help is greatly appreciated.\nThanks.\n\nA: Short Answer: If you have relatively newer version of clear, you can avoid the scrollbuffer's being cleared by -x option.\n\nLong Answer:\nclear commans is a part of ncurses.\nAccording to the changelog, \n\n20130622\n          + modify the clear program to take into account the E3 extended\n             capability to clear the terminal's scrollback buffer (patch by\n             Miroslav Lichvar, Redhat #815790).\n\nthus OP's guess\n\nI didn't see this issue with earlier to 14.04(guessing).\n\nmay be right. The changelog also says\n\n20170819\n          + add -x option to clear/tput to make the E3 extension optional\n             (cf: 20130622).\n\nSo you can use -x option if the release date of ncurses is equal to or newer than 2017-08-19. This can be checked by clear -V command. For example,\n$ clear -V\nncurses 6.1.20180127\n\nand this can be read as \"ncurses 6.1 released on 2018-01-27\".\nI confirmed, as far as I use the official repositories, the procedure is valid on\n\n\n*\n\n*Arch Linux\n\n*Arch Linux ARM\n\n*Linut Mint 19\n\n*Ubuntu 20.04\n\n*Raspbian Buster Lite\nand invalid on\n\n\n*\n\n*Raspbian Stretch Lite (This is older than Buster.)\n\n\nA: This answer builds off of stingray's answer (which he did some really good work on) and is meant to complete it.\n1 - To clear without loosing scrollback, enter the following command in console (no need for python as suggested in stringray's answer):\nprintf '\\33[H\\33[2J'\n\n2 - To avoid having to memorize this, you can edit your .bashrc file to make an alias for it. I would call the alias clear. In bash, enter:\nnano ~/.bashrc\n\nAnd add this line at the end: \nalias clean=\"printf '\\33[H\\33[2J'\"\n\nI also like to add div (for divider):\nalias div='echo;echo \"------------------------------------------------------------------------------\";echo;echo;echo;echo;echo;echo;echo;echo;echo;echo;echo;echo \"------------------------------------------------------------------------------\";clean'\n\nThis makes it so that when you do the div command, it enters two dividers with 10 new lines between them, followed by a clean command. This will make so that when you are scrolling back, you'll know exactly where you used div.\nYou can change the sudo bash behavior by doing sudo su before the procedure I listed.\nI would recommend this over bashBedlam's answer of using tic, as editing .bashrc:\n1) it doesn't require sudo privileges and can be easilly taken on the go.\n2) only affects your user (not all users will want the modified clear function)\n3) will survive updates which usually don't touch bashrc \n\nA: As mentioned above, clear -x does the trick.\nHowever, if you're like me and you habitually type clear hundreds of times a day with no hope of untraining your fingers, you may want to create a simple alias in .bashrc (or equivalent) like this:  alias clear='clear -x'.\n\nA: What you want is to type CTRL+L instead of clear.\nThis will send a \"Form Feed\" to the terminal. Basically it will move everything up the height of the terminal window clearing the screen without affecting your scrollback. \n\nA: This took me a while to figure out so I guess I should share how I got this to work.\nIf you type \"man clear\" you will see that the manual states: \n\nclear clears your screen if this is possible, including its scrollback buffer (if the extended \"E3\" capability is defined).\n\nWe are going to remove this E3 capability:\nFirst, find out the type of your terminal:\necho $TERM\n\nFor me this resulted in \"xterm-256color\". Whatever it outputs, remember it.\nNow enter the command:\ninfocmp -x xterm-256color > tempfile\n\nWhere you obviously replace xterm-256color with the output from the first command.\nThis will output the extended capabilities for this terminal type to 'tempfile'.\nNow edit this newly created file. You are looking for:\nE3=\\E[3J,\n\nFind this and just remove it. The entire thing, so if it looked like:\n    ...\n    Cs=\\E]12;%p1%s\\007, E3=\\E[3J,\n    Ms=\\E]52;%p1%s;%p2%s\\007, Se=\\E[2 q, Ss=\\E[%p1%d q,\n    ...\n\nIt should now look like:\n    ...\n    Cs=\\E]12;%p1%s\\007,\n    Ms=\\E]52;%p1%s;%p2%s\\007, Se=\\E[2 q, Ss=\\E[%p1%d q,\n    ...\n\nSave the file. And from your terminal execute:\nsudo tic -x tempfile\n\nThis will load your modified terminfo and store it. restart your terminal and clear should now no longer remove the scrollbuffer\n\nA: @heemayl and @bashBedlam Thank you. \nCTRL+L does what I want. But I am used to typing clear all the time. So I kind of worked around it by copying /lib/xterm/x/{xterm, xterm-256color} from ubuntu 12.04. There is an environment variable named $TERM that stores this file.\nThen I read your answer and tried CTRL+L and it worked. I got curious and was trying to see if I can put CTRL+L in a script and got no where.  Then I remembered strace might give me what I want. So I ran strace clear and found that it writes \"\\33[H\\33[2J\" to clear the screen. So I wrote a python oneliner \nprint(\"\\33[H\\33[2J\") and put it in a file and added a link named clear to point to it. Got 2 workarounds now.\nI am still curious of how terminfo files can be read and changed.  \nThanks again.\n\nA: For me, I do not have an issue with a locally run clear, but if I ssh into another host, and a clear is run there, it trashes my scroll history, very bad; a remote machine has way too much access IMO.\nI ended editing konsole source (21.12.1).  File src/Vt102Emulation.cpp with this:\n========================\n\n*\n\n*case token_csi_ps('J',      3) : clearHistory();                            break;\n\n\n*\n\n*case token_csi_ps('J',      3) : /* IGNORE clearHistory(); */                           break;\n\n========================\nThis makes konsole do nothing if it sees the \\E[3J string that fubars the scroll history.\n", "Q: How do I configure the lockscreen to use my PAM module in 16.04 In 14.04 I was able to do this by adding a line to /etc/pam.d/lightdm and my module is invoked for both login and the lock screen.

After putting radeon.modeset=0 into the kernel parameters in /etc/default/grub and putting amdgpu in /etc/modules I rebooted my machine. Openbox works great with the drivers but when I tried to login to unity all I got was a desktop with icons. There is no dash, no sidebar, no window title bars, and no system bar. How do I fix this?\nI have an AMD A4-6300 APU with Radeon HD Graphics and Gallium 0.4 on llvmpipe.\nMy kernel version is 4.4.0-24-generic.\n\nA: I fixed this easily by deleting the amdgpu-pro drivers altogether and updating my kernel to 4.6-generic.

A few days ago I installed the 16.04 version and I noticed that my new Ubuntu began to crash very often. I know that there are many similar topics but none of the solutions I found worked for me. My Dell freezes all the time and I hope someone will give me the right clues to solve this problem as fast as possible!\n\nA: Your processor is Intel Pentium N3540. This is affected by the c-state bug, where the processor attempts to go into unsupported sleep states. This happens with many Baytrail devices when using newer kernels. I have the same problem.\nThere is a simple workaround for this until it gets properly fixed upstream. You just need to pass a kernel boot parameter and the random freezing stops completely.\nYou do this by editing the configuration file for GRUB\nsudo nano /etc/default/grub\n\nFind the line GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash\"\nThis needs to be changed to include intel_idle.max_cstate=1\nSo after your edit it reads\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash intel_idle.max_cstate=1\"\n\nIf you have other boot parameters already besides quiet and splash, just leave them alone.\nNow save the file and exit, and run\nsudo update-grub\n\nAfter reboot, the problem will be fixed.\n", "Q: Downloading OS when computer has been stripped i have 6 laptops - 3 Dell Vostro 1500s and 3 HP Compaq NC 8430, their operating systems were removed and we need to load one to get a lab set up at deaf school in Africa.

What I want is:\nLid closed + battery power = asleep\nAFAICT, what happens instead is that unplugging the machine never causes a transition, which is … error-prone.

However, this is not a proxy solution.  A firewall could route some traffic via NAT, and route other traffic to a transparent proxy.  \nProxy aware applications can as for a CONNECT which allow them to connect through the proxy.  The proxy will transfer data without looking inside.  Normally, it will log the connection endpoint.  \nThe proxy can transparently accept the connection, and then proxy it much likely a non-transparent proxy. There can be issues with creating the connections.  It is not possible to handle all cases.  The proxy flows begin before the encryption has been negotiated, so there is no man-in-the-middle vulnerability.\nThe proxy can provide a key for the target site, and perform a man-in-the-middle attack.  If you trust the proxy, this may be acceptable for lower risk connections.  For connections to Banks and other connections requiring higher levels of security, the proxy can act transparently as described above.  This would be a relatively transparent proxy, but provides a ready made place for a man-in-the-middle attack.  \n", "Q: How can I add \"Browse Network\" to the files menu in Ubuntu 16.04?

Select Cycles as your rendering engine at the top of your scene, as the default Blender Internal renderer cannot use the GPU.\nTo enable GPU rendering, go into the User Preferences, and under the System tab, select the Compute Device(s) to use. Next, for each scene, you can configure to use CPU or GPU rendering in the Render properties.\n\nA: Try updating your NVIDIA graphics drivers by first running: \nsudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade\n\nAnd then running:\nsudo apt install nvidia-current && sudo apt install nvidia-current-updates\n\nAccording to Blenders website, you only need shader model 2.0 or above to support Cycles, and according to Nvidia, your card supports model 3.0, so that's not the problem.\nMy laptop has a 650M, and the ability to switch between that and Intel graphics. At one point I had to launch Nvidia control panel and force it to assign Blender to use the Nvidia card, because it was defaulting to the Intel chip. This was under windows, and I don't know if Nvidia provides this switching capability under Linux or not.\n", "Q: startx doesn't work on ubuntu 16.04 I modified grub, so that whenever I boot, it starts in command line mode.  However, when I type startx, it gives me a screen with the ubuntu background on it and my cursor is an x.  I can open things with C-Alt-F2, but otherwise there's nothing else I can do, not even logout.  I cant move the windows around either.  I tried running lightdm, and that gave me the login screen, but when I logged in, I was greeted by an extremely glitchy and laggy desktop, of which the background was constantly flickering from black to normal.  It heated up my computer so much that the fan was on full blast (which never happens normally).\nIf there isn't a solution for this, is there some os that has better integration between desktop environments and command lines (as in the one I boot up to, not just a terminal like xterm)?  Or, am I just doing something wrong?  My goal is to make it easy to switch from command line to desktop, and from desktop to command line.\n\nA: Startx doesn't start a DM(desktop manager) like unity or LXDE by default.

It clearly means the server will have to redirect SSH requests to each own Docker depending only on usernames.\nThe final goal is that all students can write and build their programs on the Linux environment through Bash shell, and do pretty much everything else within the SSH session. \nI have read various Docker and SSH documents but not been able to find an appropriate solution. Any help will be appreciated :).\nPS.\nWhile it's possible that it's XY problem, the reason why I want this because I don't want the server ruined by a single user. So you can suggest another way to acquire this requirement, of course.\n\nA: A similar question was asked that might answer your question:\n\nConsider using a ForceCommand directive in sshd_config. For\n  example, I use these to force groups of users to a set of\n  servers:\nMatch Group group1\n       ForceCommand ssh -t group1.fqdn\n\nMatch Group=\"*,!local,!group2,!root\"\n       ForceCommand ssh -t group3.fqdn\n\nYou could use:\nMatch User foo\n    ForceCommand ssh -t target-host\n\n\nI've never used this, but a set of directives, one for each user, could make the \"SSH gateway\" you're proposing.\n\nA: I'd rather use KVM and ansible/saltstack/puppet and have a master snapshot VM. \nThe KVM hypervisor is as clever as dokcer and makes sure that every vm doesn't get all the ressources even if one VM tries to go nuts. No need to worry about troubleshooting memory hogs, permission problems, CPU. You can even overcommit like you could with docker, that's so cool.\n\n\n*\n\n*you can control every VM through a single GUI tool\n\n*you snapshot a golden image and copy it to every machine at the first day\n\n*every machine has it's own (bridged) unique ip address\n\n*every VM can be shutdown/stopped/restarted over GUI or ssh\n\n\nkvm works great on cli but also has some small gui tools, where you can easily get hold of the root console in no time and also see the ressources used of every virtual machine on one screen. its rudimentary, but works very well. \nTo automate processes you can use tools like ansible or saltstack. so you could e.g.\n\n\n*\n\n*add further content onto the running vm's easily\n\n*you could store away the snapshots\n\n*revoke user rights or permissions on every or a single vm\n\n*stop a or all vm with an ansible command\n\n*update the golden image and spread it to all machines again\n\n*(re)move or copy a or all images\n\n*save a or all images\n\n*add individual users on the fly\n\n*add individual packets on the fly\n\n*snapshot a or all vm's\n\n\nWhy not docker? Docker is great, I use it too. Docker was meant to be \"read-only\" and to serve content to customers. This doesn't quite fit the bill?\nBut remember, there is \n\n\n*\n\n*the internal docker network\n\n*there is the docker registry, which needs to be held clean\n\n*If you don't attach another data container, then the changes are gone if you update \n\n*Also you have to worry about cgroups and namespaces\n\n\nThe VM behaves like a normal system and there is no easy way to hide for the student, because he has a definite IP adress given to him/her.\nAs HDD space is one of the lowest costs when it comes to server, I'd rather buy an additional master server or PC/laptop and use it to take full control over the 4 servers, which then run X VM's, each with it's own unique IP and/or even DNS name.\nTo set this up is more work, but I'd say you have also far more control over the servers and also over your students, because you have direct access to the VM.\nOnce everything is in place you can control your course from start to end with a few tools and ansible commands (or similar tool).\nOh, and if you add MAAS plus PXE boot to this setup, you would even be prepared for a server loss/replacement, just put in the new machine setup pxe, boot, be happy.\nHere you can see a simple setup which will get you started.\n", "Q: Unattended upgrades There are 2 files with same configuration settings in unattended \nupgrades /etc/apt/apt.conf.d: \n20auto-upgrades and 10periodic. \nAPT::Periodic::Update-Package-Lists \"1\";\nAPT::Periodic::Download-Upgradeable-Packages \"1\";\nAPT::Periodic::AutocleanInterval \"0\";\nAPT::Periodic::Unattended-Upgrade \"1\";\n\n\n\n*\n\n*What is the difference?\n\n*For AutoCleanInterval to work, do I need to set the following option in /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/50unattended-upgrades:\nUnattended-Upgrade::Remove-Unused-Dependencies \"true\";\n\nUpdate:\nNot sure if the options are working.

I've seen many examples online, but I can't understand the differences between the examples. Some examples from what I've seen so far include C Programs, so:\n\n\n*\n\n*I'm curious why the unit tests are created with Python, specifically the py.test module.\n\n*Some of the FUSE filesystem archives contain kernel sources, and some don't.  I don't understand why this is done.\n\n*At the official download page I studied  all the examples.  Please help me understand the differences between fuse-2.9.7.tar.gz, fuse-2.9.7.tar.gz.asc and Source code (zip), Source code (tar.gz).\n\n\nA: Three Major Questions\nI broke your question into the three areas you were concerned about.  While I can't help you write a FUSE file system, I can answer those 3 questions:\n\n*\n\n*Quoting Wikipedia:In computer programming, unit testing is a software testing method by which individual units of source code, sets of one or more computer program modules together with associated control data, usage procedures, and operating procedures, are tested to determine whether they are fit for use.\n\n\nIn regards to why Python was used: This was done because some, if not all programming languages contain Unit Testing Frameworks.  A framework allows a programmer to use something that already exists in order to extend and test their code.  Python was the programmer's choice for the libfuse project.  See The Hitchhiker's Guide to Python: Testing Your Code.\n\n\n\n*From the README.md file:\n\n\nFUSE (Filesystem in Userspace) is an interface for userspace programs\nto export a filesystem to the Linux kernel. The FUSE project consists\nof two components: the fuse kernel module (maintained in the regular\nkernel repositories) and the libfuse userspace library (maintained in\nthis repository). libfuse provides the reference implementation for\ncommunicating with the FUSE kernel module.\nA FUSE file system is\ntypically implemented as a standalone application that links with\nlibfuse. libfuse provides functions to mount the file system, unmount\nit, read requests from the kernel, and send responses back. libfuse\noffers two APIs: a \"high-level\", synchronous API, and a \"low-level\"\nasynchronous API. In both cases, incoming requests from the kernel are\npassed to the main program using callbacks. When using the high-level\nAPI, the callbacks may work with file names and paths instead of\ninodes, and processing of a request finishes when the callback\nfunction returns. When using the low-level API, the callbacks must\nwork with inodes and responses must be sent explicitly using a\nseparate set of API functions.\n\n\nIn regards to your question, all the archives should contain the C Files.  If what you downloaded did not contain C files, it probably wasn't a FUSE archive.\n\n\n\n*All linux based source code always comes in the format <packagename-Ver.si.on>.<compression format>.\n\n*\n\n*.tar.gz is common for Linux.  It's short for GZipped Tar Archive.  Read man tar and man gzip for more information.\n\n*.zip is common in Windows.  It's short for Zipped File.  It's linux equivalent comes as two commands.  Read man zip and man unzip.\n\n*.asc is commonly referred to as the ASCII Checksum.  This file is used to verify that the file you downloaded isn't corrupted. To verify this use the GNU Privacy Guard program.  See UNIX / Linux: PGP TarBall File Signature Keys Verification for examples.\n\n\n\nRegarding FUSE Itself\nPlease note that you probably don't need to write your own FUSE filesystem, as most distributions contain a FUSE package.  Ubuntu is one of those distributions.  See the Official Ubuntu Repository Page for FUSE, and install it with sudo apt-get-update && sudo apt-get install fuse.\n", "Q: Function keys change wrong backlight file on my Acer Aspire One Whenever I press the function keys to change my laptop's screen brightness, it modifies the value stored in the file /sys/class/backlight/acer-wmi/brightness, but my screen stays the same. With a bit of experimentation, I discovered that manually modifying the value stored in /sys/class/backlight/psb-bl/brightness will instantly change my screen's brightness.\nHow can I either make the function keys change acer-wmi's file, or make my backlight take its brightness from psb-bl's file?\nSome details that may be of use:\n\n\n*\n\n*I am running Lubuntu 15.10.\n\n*My laptop is an Acer Aspire One.\n\n*My /etc/default/grub has\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"acpi_osi=Linux acpi_backlight=vendor\"\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=\"\"\n\nIf I remove acpi_osi=Linux acpi_backlight=vendor, the same problem remains (with one minor difference: the acer-wmi link in /sys/class/backlight is changed to a different name -- I think it was acpi_video0).\n\n*Running xbacklight in terminal results in No outputs have backlight property.\n\n*When attempting to change brightness with the function keys, a bar appears in the corner of my screen that shows the current value of acer-wmi's file.\n\n*acer-wmi ranges from 0 to 9, and psb-bl ranges from 0 to 100.\n\n\nA: In lubuntu you can use openbox window manager to create bindings between a key and a action, e.g. to execute a shell script which edits your /sys/class/backlight/psb-bl/brightness. Create a new binding in the rc.xml file, which contains the mappings for your key bindings::\n<keybind key=\"key code\">\n      <action name=\"Execute\">\n        <execute>~/brightnessDown.sh</execute>\n      </action>\n </keybind>\n\nYou can verify the key code with a tool like showkeys or xev. The content of the file brightnessDown.sh should look like:\nbacklight=`cat /sys/class/backlight/psb-bl/brightness`;\nif [ $backlight -gt 1 ]; then\n       backlight=$((backlight - 1));\n       echo $backlight > /sys/class/backlight/psb-bl/brightness;\nfi\n\n", "Q: After upgrading from Ubuntu 14.04 LTS to 16.04 LTS, last process left cleaning, how to perform?

I am quite used to it and would like to keep using dual monitors.\nI know that bumblebee doesn't work with a dual monitor setup if the outputs are wired through the nvidia card but I was wondering if dual monitors work with nvidia-prime while running on the intel card (I want to run it on the intel card since it occasionally runs for extended periods of time and I can't really log out and back in again at that time).\nIf it doesn't work does anyone know of a way to make it work besides activating the nvidia profile with prime-select?\nI am planning on buying a laptop with a Nvidia Geforce GTX 950m graphical card\n\nA: I have used Optimus with multiple screens (laptop + 2 external) with a dockingstation on my ThinkPad T530. It is very tricky to get it all setup and running. In my laptop screen videos are just fine, but in my external screens I saw a bit of screentearing. I tried with a few linux distros. Fedora 23 was the first one.\nIt pretty much works out-of-the-box with the opensource drivers on two screens, and it was a bit of a hassle to get it working on the third screen too. Only then I found out that the nVidia driver was routed so that the Intel chip wasn't used any more.Thats not what Optimus is meant for.\nThen I tried it with the proprietary nVidia driver. No succes at all.\n\nAfter that I decided to give Debian 8 a try. This time I figured out that the proprietary driver in combination with the bumblebee project gave me the best results. I could use optirun on all three screens. The Intel chip presented the desktop and I could use optirun to fire up any program that runs better on 'the much faster video chip'. But, it's an illusion to think that this all easy to do. I had to install about three programs. One of those is a special Intel resolution/screen tool that gets the other two screens working besides the laptop screen. Then you have to manualy tweak the Bumblebee settings. (over and over and over) I cannot even reproduce the steps it took to get it working.\nUbuntu 14.04 was the last one I tried it on. It has the Prime profile configuration that comes with the proprietary driver. It is a pitty you have to logout and back in to get the configuration working. So you end up with either the Intel chip on or the nVidia chip on per session. I found it very annoying to close all my applications and relogin if I wanted to use the other chip. So I decided to try the things I did to Debian on Ubuntu (they have a lot in common). With a few tweaks this worked too, but I had the same crappy experience with videos and games on any of my external screens.\n\nI have come to the conclusion that it will work in some cases, depending on your laptops video chips and hardware configuration. Either you go with the logout-login method or you use Bumblebee. If there is another way, I would be delighted to hear it.\nSo in your case I would recommend to look into the intel-virtual-output tool. This tool can configure your Intel chip to use your external screens while keeping the nVidia chip turned off.\n\nI hope this gets you any further\n", "Q: Start up script - ubuntu16 I am trying to write a script which will run at startup.\nIssue is that I am trying to run this as root, on user login.\nCould someone advise me which is the best way here?\nI am on ubuntu-16, and I am having a hardtime.\nThanks for your time!\n\nA: one possible approach would be:\nCreate the script with just root acces (for safety sake)\nsudo su\nsudo echo 'echo \"Hello world, I am `whoami`\" > /tmp/test' > /path/to/script.sh\nsudo chmod 700 /path/to/script.sh\n\nThen change the sudoers file (according to mutliple tutorials everywhere)\nsudo visudo\n\ninsert the following line at the end\nyouruser    ALL = NOPASSWD: /path/to/script.sh\n\nThis grants your user to use the sudo command on exactly that script without password. This is the reason, why the root access permission is needed on the script - the script could get modified otherwise.\nNow add a custom startup command with the command\nsudo /path/to/script.sh\n\nCheck with the command \nsudo cat /tmp/test\n\nif it worked. the result should be\nHello World, I am root\n\nHope that helps and meets your requirements.\n", "Q: How to evaluate clamscan results?

That could possibly be an indicator that the destruction isn't too serious.\nThe way I see it you have two options:\n\n*\n\n*Attempt recovery\n\n*Reinstall Ubuntu\n\n\nFor attempting recovery, the first thing you're going to need to do is create a live USB drive. As you seem to be a technically inclined person, I'll simply recommend using the program from http://pendrivelinux.com\nI found this success story about ext4 recovery even though the poster had LVM: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1376383\nHe used the program testdisk, so I would suggest that as well.\nBut first,\nDo you have an external HDD >= in capacity to your internal HDD?\nIf not, you need to decide how important this recovery is to you. Remember, your data is probably still there somewhere.\nBut in order to recover it, you will be performing dangerous operations with the potential to destroy the vulnerable data.\nSo assuming you have the right sized external HDD as I mentioned previously, boot from that live USB you created earlier and dd your internal drive to the external one, like so:\n#Keep in mind this will destroy everything on the external HDD. You'll need to replace the path to the external HDD's partition accordingly, or else you will most certainly facilitate further destruction.\nsudo dd if=\"/dev/sda\" of=\"/dev/sdb\"\n\nThat will take several hours to complete. So give it some time.\nAfterwards, disconnect your external drive.\nCongratulations! You now have a complete drive image, meaning that if you completely wreck the entire partition table on your internal one, you can still restore to the exact state you are in now\nNow that you have said drive image, have a go with testdisk and see what it comes up with.\n", "Q: Software centre shows no app found I am using Ubuntu 16.04 for the first time.

I cannot find this option in Kubuntu 16.04. Is it still possible somehow?\nThe documentation of the package lightdm-kde-greeter states \"This package also includes a KCM module to configure the greeter.\". Is this related to the System Settings GUI?\n\nA: You can edit the configuration file directly, but you may have to install lightdm-gtk-greeter (if not already installed).  Go to the terminal and type:\nsudo apt-get install lightdm-gtk-greeter\n\nThen edit the configuration file:\nsudo nano /etc/lightdm/lightdm-gtk-greeter.conf\n\nor if you prefer to use a GUI text editor,\nsudo -i kate /etc/lightdm/lightdm-gtk-greeter.conf\n\nIf you want to edit the background wallpaper specifically, search for the line that begins with background= and replace the text which follows with the path to your file.  I would recommend copying your file into /usr/share/wallpapers and pointing to that path.\n\nA: Yes, KConfig Modules are what you would use to add features to the KDE control panel (here for example the one for SDDM). \nAnd one existed as a part of the lightdm-kde-greeter. But considering your experience, I suppose that did never work with Plasma 5 since it always remained stuck to Qt4 libraries. \n", "Q: bluetooth problem 14.04 (switch on/off) I have a similar problem as this question but nothing helps, this is what I've tried in the Terminal:\ntetrev@tetrev-X55C:~$ lspci \n00:00.0 Host bridge: Intel Corporation 3rd Gen Core processor DRAM Controller (rev 09)\n00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation 3rd Gen Core processor Graphics Controller (rev 09)\n00:14.0 USB controller: Intel Corporation 7 Series/C210 Series Chipset Family USB xHCI Host Controller (rev 04)\n00:16.0 Communication controller: Intel Corporation 7 Series/C210 Series Chipset Family MEI Controller #1 (rev 04)\n00:1a.0 USB controller: Intel Corporation 7 Series/C210 Series Chipset Family USB Enhanced Host Controller #2 (rev 04)\n00:1b.0 Audio device: Intel Corporation 7 Series/C210 Series Chipset Family High Definition Audio Controller (rev 04)\n00:1c.0 PCI bridge: Intel Corporation 7 Series/C210 Series Chipset Family PCI Express Root Port 1 (rev c4)\n00:1c.1 PCI bridge: Intel Corporation 7 Series/C210 Series Chipset Family PCI Express Root Port 2 (rev c4)\n00:1c.3 PCI bridge: Intel Corporation 7 Series/C210 Series Chipset Family PCI Express Root Port 4 (rev c4)\n00:1d.0 USB controller: Intel Corporation 7 Series/C210 Series Chipset Family USB Enhanced Host Controller #1 (rev 04)\n00:1f.0 ISA bridge: Intel Corporation HM76 Express Chipset LPC Controller (rev 04)\n00:1f.2 SATA controller: Intel Corporation 7 Series Chipset Family 6-port SATA Controller [AHCI mode] (rev 04)\n00:1f.3 SMBus: Intel Corporation 7 Series/C210 Series Chipset Family SMBus Controller (rev 04)\n02:00.0 Network controller: Ralink corp.

The solution I lived with for quite some time was to simply switch to Intel which solves the tearing but the performance is horrible.

I don't mind going back through the same things I already did because I could've made a mistake as long as it's not something that could totally wreck the OS.

I picked the latest one and installed it using:\nsudo apt-get install python=2.7.5-5ubuntu3\n\nIt gave me a warning it couldn't delete some \"old directories\":\ndpkg: warning: unable to delete old directory '/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages': Directory not empty\ndpkg: warning: unable to delete old directory '/usr/local/lib/python2.7': Directory not empty\ndpkg: warning: unable to delete old directory '/usr/local/lib': Directory not empty\ndpkg: warning: unable to delete old directory '/usr/local': Directory not empty\n\nBut that's fine, since I actually tried to solve the problem without deleting these directories.\nNow if I do a dpkg -l python I get the following, correct output:\nDesired=Unknown/Install/Remove/Purge/Hold\n| Status=Not/Inst/Conf-files/Unpacked/halF-conf/Half-inst/trig-aWait/Trig-pend\n|/ Err?=(none)/Reinst-required (Status,Err: uppercase=bad)\n||/ Name                                          Version                     Architecture                Description\n+++-=============================================-===========================-===========================-====================================================================\nii  python                                        2.7.5-5ubuntu3              amd64                       interactive high-level object-oriented language (default version)\n\nI will monitor if I get any more strange behaviour from my system, but for now it seems this fixed the issue.\n", "Q: Wifi-driver not working Lenovo z51-70 03:00.0 Network controller [0280]: Broadcom Corporation Device [14e4:43ae] (rev 02)\n    Subsystem: Lenovo Device [17aa:0622]\n\n\nA: This adapter is not supported by any existing Linux drivers so far.\n", "Q: Aircrack offline installation I'm new to Ubuntu.

Is it possible to use different icon sets for them? The \"fallback theme\" option doesn't work for that.\n\nA: I don't have KDE installed right now to test. As I remember with Kubuntu 15.04, KDE was creating two files to override GTK theme settings.\nGTK2:\n~/.gtkrc-2.0\n\nGTK3:\n~/.config/gtk-3.0/settings.ini\n\nAs they are two separate file you can change them differently. But you may need to change them to read-only so KDE config tool will not able to change them.\nI could find a reference with example: Archlinux Wiki - GTK\n\nBasic theme configuration\nTo manually change the GTK+ theme, icons, font and font size, add the\n  following to the configuration files, for example:\nGTK+ 2:\n~/.gtkrc-2.0\n\ngtk-icon-theme-name = \"Adwaita\"\ngtk-theme-name = \"Adwaita\"\ngtk-font-name = \"DejaVu Sans 11\"\n\nGTK+ 3:\n$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/gtk-3.0/settings.ini\n\n[Settings]\ngtk-icon-theme-name = Adwaita\ngtk-theme-name = Adwaita\ngtk-font-name = DejaVu Sans 11\n\nNote: The icon theme name is the name defined in the theme's index file, not the name of its directory.\n\n", "Q: What is the difference between 'kill' and the 'k' option within 'top' in Linux? I found out from http://www.tecmint.com/12-top-command-examples-in-linux/ (it's number 7 on that webpage) that you can use the k option to terminate a program. Would that work in the same way as quitting top and using kill?\n\nA: The command kill can be used to send a signal to a process. Useful signals, as in man, are: HUP, INT, KILL, STOP, CONT, and 0.\nExample:\nsudo kill -9 1234 - send signal KILL to process with pid 1234\ntop can be used to watch Linux processes. There is an option on this command to send signals to processes too. You should already know process PID:\n\n\n*\n\n*After starting top, find process you would like to send a signal.\n\n*Press k.\n\n*Inform for which PID you would like to send signal.\n\n*Inform which signal you want and press enter.\n\n*Signal will be sent to process PID.\n\n\nWant to know more about Linux Signals?\n\nA: Exactly the same. They both need a PID and signal to send.\nBy  default they both send SIGTERM and you can pick another signal to send too.\n", "Q: Is there a difference in performance between Ubuntu-only computer and Ubuntu installed on a Windows machine? I mostly work with Ubuntu, but most computers available in my workplace come with Windows 7 or 8 or 10 already installed. I can either install Ubuntu in addition to Windows, or install Ubuntu after removing Windows. Besides the disk-space, is there any difference in performance between these options? \nE.g, when I boot into Ubuntu, is it possible that the installed Windows will waste some system resources?\n\nA: As long as Ubuntu is running on dual-boot, as opposed to in a virtual machine, the only system resource Windows will take up when you're in Ubuntu is hard disk space.  As long as you have enough space available for the Ubuntu OS (20 GB is adequate, 30 GB is better), swap (2x RAM) and /home (as big as you'll need for your storage and tarball installs), it should run as well as it would on a dedicated computer.\n\nA: No, you should not experience a decrease in performance\nThe only thing that is negatively-impacted by running a dual-boot is your drive space. While this may have other side effects that may cause a decrease in performance, it is not necessarily caused by a dual-boot specific performance decrease.\nDisregarding drive space, you will not be experiencing any performance losses because only 1 operating system is going to be running at a time, therefore the other operating system cannot be making any calls and taking away CPU time or RAM.\n\nA: You can only boot one operating system at a time! If you boot only one operating system all the time, it will remain preloaded in RAM memory, thus booting faster. When you switch from one OS to the other, the RAM memory is erased and the other OS is loaded into RAM, thus longer boot time might occur (like in a first time boot, a.k.a. cold boot).  \nThe specific performance of each OS is independent from other OSes, it only depends on the way it functions internally. Typically, Windows performance decreases with time, Ubuntu performance increases with time (because Ubuntu preloads in RAM the most used programs and files).\n", "Q: DLink dwa 131 H/W ver :E1 F/W ver : 5.1 how do i install it's wifi driver in UBUNTU 16.04 The wifi adapter doesnt work on my laptop lenovo Z51 UBUNTU 16.04 info about the adapter\nDLink dwa 131 H/W ver :E1 F/W ver : 5.1 \nlsusb\n Bus 001 Device 002: ID 8087:8001 Intel Corp. \n Bus 001 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub\n Bus 003 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0003 Linux Foundation 3.0 root hub\n Bus 002 Device 005: ID 0489:e079 Foxconn / Hon Hai \n Bus 002 Device 004: ID 5986:0670 Acer, Inc \n Bus 002 Device 003: ID 0bda:0129 Realtek Semiconductor Corp.

I have a compact SoC (System On a Chip) Dell laptop with the DF4032 SanDisk eMMC 32 GB storage device soldered to its only PCB, and there is no information concerning TRIM support for it anywhere.

Would it be safe to include --no-model-check on the fstrim file? I would need to specify the /dev/mmcblk0 device so it would not mess with the SDHC card inserted. TRIM can be deadly for some not so popular devices.\n\nA: TRIM does not work through USB, but usually, you get a message about \"unsupported ioctl\" when you run it on such a device (external USB disk enclosure).  Confirm that your mmcblk0 is really not on USB:\nlsblk -o TRAN,SUBSYSTEMS,NAME,TYPE\n\nMy SD cards on mmcblk0 do not list a TRAN, but seem to appear under the USB branch since it follows a USB.

Finally changing the preferences as it is described here: https://superuser.com/a/400389/218025\nHowever if you want to have one virtual hard disk shared between all users (because your hard disk is not very big, for example), my next approach was going to be to create the following script:\nif [ stat -c %U MyVirtualBoxFolder ] \nthen\n    echo \"You are the owner\"\nelse\n    echo “Changing permissions of /Users/shared_folder/.VirtualBox VMs/“\n    sudo chmod -R 777 MyVirtualBoxFolder\nfi\n\necho \"Opening VirtualBox…”\nvirtualbox\n\nNotice I have not tested the command stat -c %U MyVirtualBoxFolder.

If not, correct them before launching VirtualBox.\n\nUPDATE:\nMaybe it is better to create a script that just change the permissions always before opening VirtualBox:\nsudo chmod -R 777 MyVirtualBoxFolder\nvirtualbox\n\nThe only issue to reach perfection is that the user must type its password always to open VirtualBox (and must be admin by the way!)\n", "Q: Reinstalling Ubuntu via SSH, keeping home folder/partition I have a dedicated server that I cannot access anymore, for some reason, after a reboot.

Look at the ROTA column of the output and there you will see numbers.  A 0 means no rotation speed or SSD drive.  A 1 would indicate a drive with platters that rotate.  My Ubuntu is installed on my /dev/sdb drive, so we can see that one indicates a 0 which means it is installed on a SSD drive.  I put after this example of how to tell where your OS is installed using df.\nNOTE: Ubuntu that is installed as a client in either loop or VMs will show ROTA 1 regardless of host OS installation.  Also, \"solid-state hybrid drives\" and USB flash drives will also show ROTA 1.\nExample:\nterrance@terrance-ubuntu:~$ lsblk -o name,rota\nNAME   ROTA\nsda       1\n└─sda1    1\nsdb       0\n├─sdb1    0\n├─sdb2    0\n└─sdb5    0\nsdc       1\n└─sdc1    1\nsdd       1\n└─sdd1    1\nsde       0\n├─sde1    0\n└─sde2    0\nsdf       1\n└─sdf1    1\nsdg       1\n└─sdg1    1\nsdh       1\n└─sdh1    1\nsr0       1\nsr1       1\n\nOr you can do the check as a one liner script using -d to not show partitions:\nlsblk -d -o name,rota | awk 'NR>1' | grep -v loop | while read CC; do dd=$(echo $CC | awk '{print $2}'); if [ ${dd} -eq 0 ]; then echo $(echo $CC | awk '{print $1}') is a SSD drive; fi; done\n\nExample:\nterrance@terrance-ubuntu:~$ lsblk -d -o name,rota | awk 'NR>1' | grep -v loop | while read CC; do dd=$(echo $CC | awk '{print $2}'); if [ ${dd} -eq 0 ]; then echo $(echo $CC | awk '{print $1}') is a SSD drive; fi; done\nsdb is a SSD drive\nsde is a SSD drive\n\n\nTo determine what drive your installation is on, run the command df / from a terminal window.\nNOTE: Drives configured with LVM (Logical Volume Management) actually show the drive as /boot instead of /.\nExamples:\nLVM Drive:\ndf /\nFilesystem                   1K-blocks      Used Available Use% Mounted on\n/dev/mapper/xubuntu--vg-root 243352964 106945028 123976576  47% /\n\ndf /boot\nFilesystem     1K-blocks   Used Available Use% Mounted on\n/dev/sda1         720368 237220    430756  36% /boot\n\nNon-LVM Drive:\ndf /\n/dev/sdb1       222309012   38264268  172728984  19% /\n\n\nUPDATE: lsblk can also be used to show where the OS is installed and if the drive is SSD all in one command:\nlsblk -o NAME,MOUNTPOINT,MODEL,ROTA\n\nExample:\nterrance@terrance-ubuntu:~$ lsblk -o NAME,MOUNTPOINT,MODEL,ROTA\nNAME   MOUNTPOINT         MODEL            ROTA\nsda                       Backup+ Desk        1\n└─sda1 /media/Seagate                         1\nsdb                       WDC WD2500JD-00K    1\n└─sdb1 /media/250GB_SHARE                     1\nsdc                       WDC WD5000AAKS-4    1\n└─sdc1 /media/500GB                           1\nsdd                       ST500DM002-1BC14    1\n└─sdd1 /media/320GB                           1\nsde                       SanDisk SDSSDA24    0\n├─sde1 /                                      0\n├─sde2                                        0\n└─sde5 [SWAP]                                 0\nsdf                       WDC WD5000AAKX-2    1\n└─sdf1 /media/WD500GB                         1\nsdg                       WDC WD10EZEX-00W    1\n└─sdg1 /media/1TB_SHARE                       1\nsdh                       SanDisk SDSSDA24    0\n├─sdh1                                        0\n└─sdh2 /media/Windows                         0\nsr0                       BD-RE  BH16NS40     1\nsr1                       DVD-RAM GH40L       1\n\nThis is after a system reboot, so my drive designations changed again, but as you can see my SanDisk drives are SSDs and ROTA shows 0.\n\nHope this helps!\n\nA: In the end your question isn't really a Ubuntu question. You have a Hard Drive with a small, relative to the size of the HD, amount of flash storage. This is managed automatically for you by the drive and tries to place the more frequently accessed files on the Flash portion rather than the HD portion. As far as I know there is no way to control or tell what files are on which portion. If you regularly use Ubuntu all the important files should end up in the flash portion of your drive but that's about it.\n", "Q: Ubuntu Touch - root access without signing in I got an Ubuntu tablet because I expected more freedom and control over my privacy. Now I learn it is not quite like that. If this fails my expectation, the package ships right back...\nQuestion: how to gain root access (terminal access and apt-get) without an Ubuntu One account?\nTo clarify: It's not that I wouldn't want the account. I don't want it on the tablet.\n\nA: If you don't want to install apps from the app store, because you don't want an Ubuntu One account, then you will have to build the packages from source and side-load them.\nYou can side-load an app if you have the click package for it, by putting the click on the device, and running pkcon install-local --allow-untrusted foo.click for example. You can use adb over USB to access the device and run these commands prior to installing the Terminal app.\nYou can also re-flash your device to the non-retail device images, which I believe have the Terminal app pre-installed.\n", "Q: How to disable animations in Ubuntu 16.04 For some reasons the animations really slow up my Ubuntu virtual machine. How can I disable all the frilly animations?\n\n\n*\n\n*Super Key Dashboard fade-in/fade-out\n\n*Alt+Tab fade-in/fade-out\n\n*Other?\n\n\nThere are related questions, but the answer seems to change from version to version, and I haven't found any that work for the Super Key and Alt+Tab animations.\n\nA: For the super key animation, you can try to disable background blur, using the Unity Tweak Tool, disabling any suggestion, history, etc, can speed up the super key.\nTo alt-tab I don't know anything that can disable the effects, but in Unity Tweak Tool you can disable windows animation on the section Window Manager -> General, for me, this was very significant to performance.\nWhat you can do as well is disable the shadows from windows.\n\nA: It turned out I just needed to enable video acceleration in VirtualBox. This was more effective in speeding up my virtual Ubuntu than disabling animations.\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down the guest OS.\n\n*In VirtualBox Manager, right-click the VM.\n\n*Go to Display.\n\n*In the Screen tab, check \"Enable 3D Acceleration.\"\n\n\nA: EDIT: I didn't read you saying that you don't want to switch versions. I find Synapse a better replacement for the Dashboard and Ubuntu MATE's Alt+Tab displays some handy previews while switching windows. But that's REALLY up to you, in this case. I never found any improvements in disabling visual effects on Ubuntu.\nSince Unity is a compiz plugin and its whole functionality depends on the desktop compositing, it's difficult to make it lighter. If someday you get tired of the sluggish performance, try Ubuntu MATE. It's sort of a younger brother of Ubuntu. They share the same theming, same icons, panels, title bar... Nothing else gets that close to providing you a lighter Ubuntu experience. And 16.04 now comes with Mutiny, a left-panel interface similar to that of Unity (with global menus). Distrowatch - Ubuntu MATE. Good luck!\n\nA: Copy and paste the following into the Terminal and press enter.\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface enable-animations false\n\nThe above command will disable the animation of the icon. If you wish to bring it back, copy & paste the following command:\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface enable-animations true\n\nThat’s it! Check the “Applications” menu. You should no longer see the animation of the icons. Instead, you will see all the application icons appear at once.\n\nA: From unity tweak tool go to General and switch off Windows animations as seen below:\n\nIf you don't have it, you can install it with sudo apt install unity-tweak-tool.\n", "Q: How can I check an \"unexpected EOF\" in my .tar.gz file?

To be honest, I did not manage to entirely solve this issue, though I suspect it has something to do with the X11 protocol and I am sure there is proper fix for that out there. In the meantime, I found a workaround that makes it possible to run the application over SSH while keeping the other screen on.\nNamely, need to run a virtual machine on the local desktop limited to a single screen and then connect via SSH to the remote server. It goes without saying that the virtual machine should have enough resources, especially video memory if the application is heavy on the visual aspect; network paravirtualization is also something nice to have.\nThis process can be a bit more of a hassle than simply turning off one display, but you get to use the two monitors in exchange. If you are going to run that application over SSH regularly, I find it's worthwhile setting the virtual machine - and most will probably have one already.\n", "Q: How to install VirtualBox Guest Additions for Ubuntu 16.04 What is the best way to install Guest Additions with all the resize and clipboard and file sharing features on Ubuntu 16.04?\n\nA: For Ubuntu Server, it is necessary to install guest additions from command line.\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install virtualbox-guest-dkms \n\n\nA: This worked for VirtualBox 5.1.28 MacOS host running Ubuntu Server 16.04.3 LTS guest. All instructions are for the guest Ubuntu Server.\nNote: do not use the VirtualBox GUI to \"Insert Guest Additions CD Image.\" It did not invoke \"vboxadd.sh\" as did the up-to-date .iso downloaded from the virtualbox website. In addition, your guest must have internet access (use \"NAT\" instead of \"bridged adapter\" if you are having trouble with your guest OS internet).\nIn terminal, download the VBoxGuestAdditions.iso for your version of VirtualBox (for me it's 5.1.28).\nwget http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/5.1.28/VBoxGuestAdditions_5.1.28.iso\n\nThen create an empty directory in /media and mount it there:\nsudo mkdir /media/iso\nsudo mount VBoxGuestAdditions_5.1.28.iso /media/iso\n\nThen go there and run the Linux installer:\ncd /media/iso\nsudo ./VBoxLinuxAdditions.run\n\nReboot your guest OS:\nreboot\n\nYou should be able to access your shared folder under /media/sf_[your_folder_name]\n\nA: This worked for me:\nsudo mount /dev/cdrom /media/cdrom\nsudo apt install -y dkms build-essential linux-headers-generic linux-headers-$(uname -r)\nsudo sh /media/cdrom/VBoxLinuxAdditions.run\n\nThen rebooted the virtual machine.\n\nA: There is a guest additions package, but this only enabled some of the features for me.\nThe most reliable way is probably to use the built-in installer that comes with VirtualBox.\nThis is for Ubuntu Desktop. For Ubuntu Server, see @ThisClark's answer.\nUpdates\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure you have the latest version of VirtualBox.\n\n*It might be good to first sudo apt update and sudo apt upgrade and restart if needed.\n\n\nGuest Additions\n\n\n*\n\n*Power on virtual machine\n\n*Click \"Devices\" on the VirtualBox menu at the top of the screen\n\n*Click \"Install Guest Additions CD Image...\"\n\n*Follow the on-screen prompts as needed, enter your password, etc.\n\n*Restart the virtual machine\n\n\nEnable features\n\n\n*\n\n*Machine -> Settings -> General -> Advanced -> enable Shared Clipboard and/or Drag'n'Drop.\n\n*Make sure View -> Auto-resize Guest Display is checked.\n\n\nA: If you don't download the ISO, you won't get the \"latest and greatest\" version.  If you'd like to stick with this option, please see the following notes for dependencies.\nI have tested these instructions successfully under an Ubuntu 16.04 guest:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Create Ubuntu server instance under VirtualBox (obviously).  \n  \n*Start VM, go to Devices -> Insert Guest Additions CD image to mount the ISO image.\n  \n*From the terminal, run the following commands:\nsudo -i  \napt install gcc make  \nmkdir -p /media/cdrom  \nmount /dev/cdrom /media/cdrom  \n/media/cdrom/VBoxLinuxAdditions.run  \nreboot  \n\n  \n*After reboot:\nsudo usermod --append --groups vboxsf USERNAME\n\n  \n*Host shares should now be mounted in Ubuntu guest under /media via the installed VBoxService service, set to start on system boot-up.\n\nThis impacted my install.\nNoted from comment:\n\n\n*\n\n*Log out and back in again after adding user account to vboxsf group\n\n\nA: 1) Install a package through the usual channels for your distribution. For example, you might use: \nsudo apt-get install virtualbox-guest-additions-iso\n\n2) Add in the guest additions by choosing Devices > Optical Drives > VBoxGuestAdditions.iso\nWhen you use the above command to download the iso file. It can be found here:\n/usr/share/virtualbox/VBoxGuestAdditions.iso\n\n\nA: Virtual Box 5.1 wanted?\nIf you intend to get and use Virtual Box 5.1 (not 5.0), at the time of writing, you won't afaik get it through apt. And adding 3rd party repos can get you unintendedly the 32bit version with an obscure error version, see this answer.\nThus it's probably best to download VirtualBox itself and the Guest Additions (now renamed/part of \"Extension Pack\" it directly from the highest 5.1.x version you can find here:\nhttp://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/\n\ni.e.\nhttp://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/5.1.28/\n\n(After abovemtioned 32bit nuisances, ) I got lucky with\nvirtualbox-5.1_5.1.28-117968~Ubuntu~xenial_amd64.deb\n\nThe two offered extension packs are identical (same checksum), pick any:\nOracle_VM_VirtualBox_Extension_Pack-5.1.28-117968.vbox-extpack\nOracle_VM_VirtualBox_Extension_Pack-5.1.28.vbox-extpack  \n\nHow to install all of that?

It was working fine for a while. Later, after making some more customizations (installed Cairo-Dock, but it was performing terribly, so I removed it and replaced it with Docky), I eventually noticed that the Unity Tweak Tool icon on the dock was a gray box with a question mark, like it had been removed. I checked a terminal to see if I could just launch it via command line, but now the OS said it was not installed.\nI've been attempting to reinstall the Unity Tweak Tool without any luck:\nIf I try clicking the install button in Ubuntu Software for the tool, it looks like its downloading for a moment, but then the Install button returns (yet, the unity launcher shows the icon and says \"waiting to install\").

Maybe this is because of your hurry in asking your question or my insufficient amount of English knowledge. Anyhow if I've comprehended your question correctly, you are trying to install Lamp without having errors in Linux. Linux systems come completely different from Windows environment in some cases. In fact, the Xampp version for Linux is called LAMP (Linux, Apache, Mysql, PHP). Because Linux's power is mostly gained via its command line environment you can go to the address below to find out how to properly install LAMP on your Linux.\nHow To Install Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP (LAMP) stack on Ubuntu 14.04\n", "Q: How to install packer system-wide? Where can I install packer in filesystem for system-wide usage in Ubuntu 16.04 Xenial? Where should I place its binary to be available system-wide since it is not part of the OS?\n\nA: Copied binary to /usr/local/bin.\nThis location is for normal user programs not managed by the distribution package manager, e.g. locally compiled packages. This prevents these softwares from being deleted when system upgrades. This usage is the de facto convention. As was said in comments, there is not an unique location for copying packer binary to.\nAlso, this path is already in the $PATH environment variable.\n", "Q: I mistakenly purged gsettings-desktop-schemas; how can I recover?

Yesterday I installed Ubuntu on my laptop, and due to my bad luck, I accidentally deleted the partition. The data on the disk was very important to me. I tried TestDisk to recover partition but that didn't work for me.\nSomeone suggested to try software on Windows. But if I install Windows on my laptop then it will overwrite the data, so I'm planning to clone the hard drive by using the 'dd' commands and use that external hard drive to recover data on Windows.\nWill it work ?\n\nA: Yes, dd clones every bit on the drive, including deleted files and free space.\nYou could also look into CloneZilla, which is a user-friendly LiveCD  for cloning and restoring disks, though I'm not sure its disk-image format would be compatible with your Windows software. http://clonezilla.org/\n", "Q: Is there any recommended partition layout for Ubuntu 16.04 aimed to be the only OS for a production environment machine? Ubuntu is being considered for adoption in an electronic projects production environment. Since there is a requirement for the entire environment to be always updated, cache for packages and kernels are always getting bigger. Frequent changes are also required, what could impact in partition layout.\nI would like to know if there is any recommended partition layout(size, partition types, mounting points, etc) for Ubuntu 16.04 in this case.\n\nA: It depends on what your using or how your using it. Are you using a live cd/usb? Are you using it as your main OS? Is there any other OS(s) in the HDD/cd/usb/(....ext) you are placing it? Any other files your trying to put on said medium that you want to keep? If not then just let the installer handle it. If you want to increase size needed later, or maybe downsize/modify the partitions' later, then they have a box to check otherwise let it handle it from there.\nIf you are adding it alongside another OS, then partitioning from the other OS, should make that partition space show up as a separate drive, so you will be able to see which one to let the auto install loose on. If you are just trying to go for the bare minimum then follow the recommended settings for your version on Ubuntu. Then add half as much swap space, and leave free space separating all the partitions.\nPersonally I prefer my 2Tb removable hard drive to take with me. /*the only issue I had with that is I use OSX and windows on my macbook pro 11.3 with bootcamp, but with rEFInd and a couple driver issues that got resolved.  everything works out smoothly with a nice boot screen to boot... pardon the pun  */\nBut anyway it is severely user dependent on what they use, I've provided the recommended requirements and minimum, with the minimum linking to the installation guide. Hope it helps, if not then please add more specifics of what your wanting to do, or use it for.\n~\n2.3. Memory and Disk Space Requirements\nYou must have at least 20MB of memory and 680MB of hard disk space to perform a normal installation. Note that these are fairly minimal numbers. For more realistic figures, see Section 3.4, “Meeting Minimum Hardware Requirements”.\nInstallation on systems with less memory or disk space available may be possible but is only advised for experienced users\n~\n// and yes I know grammar is atrocious\n", "Q: Ubuntu drive with windows programs I'm sorry if this has been asked, but I'm not seeing this anywhere. \nI have Ubuntu 16 installed on a 32 3.0 USB drive.

Not to run windows programs with wine, but plug the USB into a windows machine and use it like thumb drive with utilities on it . . . and also be able to boot Ubuntu off of it when needed. I hope that makes sense, I can't imagine this not being asked before, but every time I try to describe the question in a search engine I come up with answers on how to run windows programs from within Ubuntu using wine. \nIs this even possible?\n\nA: Yes, although it gets a bit more complicated then that.\nYou would need to find portable versions of your \"utilities\", because you can't just move program installs from one machine to another.\nAssuming you were able to find portable versions, the next thing you need to do is partition the drive.\nSo boot up Ubuntu, and fire up the terminal. Then run:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install gparted\n\nOpen up the newly installed gparted and shrink your main Linux EXT4 volume by however much you want. So if you want 8GB available for Windows utilities, you need to shrink it by 8GB.\nAfter that, you need to format that empty space you just created as NTFS.\nThen you're good to go!\n", "Q: How to instal pymedia for python I am new in Ubuntu and new in Python too but aim to write simple app which will play video from file.

I've tried installing through Synaptic and manually through the mirror sites, I've tried adding lines to /etc/apt/sources.list like some have suggested but so far nothing has happened. \nThis isn't so much a question of how to fix this, but more of a what's going on? I've run sudo apt-get update and then sudo apt-get upgrade with no change. I've then run sudo apt-get dist-upgrade. The output of sudo apt-get upgrade is:\n    Reading package lists...

So now I don't know why these packages won't update or are being \"held back\" like the dist-upgrade command tells me. Sorry for the long question. I hope I got the main points across clearly!\n\nA: I figured this out by actually breaking Ubuntu.\nWhile trying to install build-essential I tried removing these packages that were \"held back\" and Ubuntu actually broke. I could only load Ubuntu through recovery mode and, after lots of playing with a terminal, I managed to fix Ubuntu enough to boot to a terminal only version of Ubuntu. I had managed to uninstall the Ubuntu Desktop itself (as well as some other very important files that make computers work and stuff).\nWhile trouble-shooting this problem I discovered an argument that for some reason has only ever fixed similar problems for me with the Desktop and the build-essential package. I got a huge long dependency for the Desktop because very important files were missing and I couldn't unlock root for some odd reason to save my files which I needed for school. I instead just researched this new problem and discovered that if I use sudo apt-get install build-essential checkinstall then it would install all dependencies with it (why hasn't anyone used this before!!?). I then tried that with ubuntu-desktop and it install just fine and now I have both things. So I guess what was happening is that I had just messed up some resource list so that files that needed to be updated just weren't getting updated.\nIn short and answer to both questions, what was happening was this: I made a mistake in my /etc/apt/sources.list that prevented certain important files to update and to install build-essential you just have to add checkinstall to the end of your apt-get command. If you have this same problem at any point in your life, you might consider moving your important documents to a computer you won't regularly break. \n", "Q: Restarting X session shows screen blank for some time and comes up When I restart the X session using Ctrl + Alt + Backspace in Ubuntu Machine , the X session is restarted and blank screen is showing up for some period of time(3 sec) and then the session comes up.\nHow to reduce the blank screen time which is displayed during the restart of X session?\nAny ideas would be appreciated.\n\nA: You can't.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​\n", "Q: Data loss after ubuntu 16.03 install I installed  Ubuntu 16.03 over Windows 7 using a DVD burned from a downloaded iso.

Can we (please) build a community summary of how to install sane graphics drivers for Nvidia Optimus hardware on *Ubuntu 16.04?\nI can see this becoming a recurring thing every few years.\nUbuntu 16.04 was released not too many months ago and I have bought a new hard disk and installed Kubuntu 16.04 on it. My laptop is something from a few years back with an intel something graphics driver on the CPU and an Nvidia GTX 670MX discrete card. (It's an optimus system.)\nNow one used to get this working via some strange combination of bumblebee and nvidia drivers and editing text config files, etc, etc, you used to run primusrun/optirun executable_file and it (sort of, rather unconvincingly) worked. (Until a new update broke it again, or you wanted to use CUDA...)\nSee this question for additional context, and also see the questions linked there.\nHow do I \"optimus\" with Ubuntu 16.04?\nIt is my understanding that the new release of 16.04 does away with all the primusrun/optirun stuff, and we now have  a seemlessly switching graphics solution which works \"much more better\" than before. (Or is this just totally wrong information and I completely misunderstood what I read online?)\nSo, I attempted to do a sudo apt-get install nvidia-361-updates which brought along with it nvidia-prime... I rebooted back into Kubuntu and everything seemed to be working! My graphics card started to get warm and the fan started rotating, which doesn't usually happen unless the card is \"on and doing something to make it heat up\". I couldn't test it any further but I assume it was rendering stuff for the desktop environment.\nBut, somewhile later my system just suddenly turns off. I reboot and suddenly I can't login anymore... Either the system freezes, logs out or turns off.\nSo I attempted to follow information in this question.\nWhich just made things worse. Now I can't even get to a login screen. After boot my screen stays black/blank. However I can still get to a tty window.\nThere are other questions here and here which describe similar issues but did not resolve the problem. (I found these after searching for ubuntu 16.04 graphics driver blank screen or something similar to this.)\nWhat is the \"right\" way to do it.\nI've done the classic thing of trying too many things \"which might fix it\", but since I don't fully understand in detail the exact effects of all the commands I'm running I've got myself into a hole and it's probably time to start again with a fresh install and get it right the first time.\nSo my question is, how do I \"get it right\"?

Not sure what it would be without the Nvidia driver.\nUpdate - No it doesn't work!\nI have a rather irritating problem which has rendered my system unusable. When browsing files, sometimes when changing directory there is a ~1 second delay before the window updates - this makes it difficult to browse files on the system quickly.\nIn addition, when typing in the terminal, there is an occasional delay/lag which prevents one from running commands efficiently and quickly.\nHence my system is \"unusable\".\nWhat I am trying now.\n0: Fresh install of xubuntu 16.04. apt-get update / upgrade\n1: sudo apt-get install intel-microcode\n2: Reboot\n3: sudo apt-add-repository ppa:/graphics-drivers/ppa\n4: sudo apt-get install nvidia-364 (not 367)\nJust checked and laptop BIOS appears to have secure boot disabled.\n5: Reboot\n6: glxgears -info | grep \"GL_\" reports that glxgears is now running using Nvidia card\n7: glxinfo | grep \"OpenGL version\" Also suggests nvidia card is functioning.\n8: ... will update if graphics problems resurface...\nUpdates: Noticed graphics problems when switching into/out of screensaver.

I used rufus to create an installation flash drive, but I'm trying to set it up to use my external hard drive as the main drive. (I would like to remove the flash drive after installation.)\nThe information I've found online all talks about UEFI vs legacy mode? But it never gives me any options wrt to UEFI. Also, the NUC doesn't enter the BIOS menus when I press F2 for some reason :(\nWhat is the simplest way to install ubuntu on the NUC using my external hard drive? Is there a way to circumvent the flash drive and just use the hard drive to install?\n\nA: When you boot the Ubuntu installer, it will boot in one of two modes, depending on how the boot medium was prepared and what your firmware settings are:\n\n\n*\n\n*EFI/UEFI mode -- This is the native mode on the vast majority of new computers. When booted in EFI mode, the Ubuntu installer normally likes to use the GUID Partition Table (GPT), on which it creates an EFI System Partition (ESP) to hold the EFI-mode boot loader. Your message indicates that this boot mode was not used in your attempt to install the OS.\n\n*BIOS/CSM/legacy mode -- This mode is used on older (most pre-2011) computers, and is an option on most newer ones. When it boots in this mode, the Ubuntu installer will normally try to use the Master Boot Record (MBR) partition table; however, if the installation disk already uses GPT, the Ubuntu installer will want to see a BIOS Boot Partition on the disk to hold a BIOS-mode copy of GRUB. The message you're seeing indicates that you've got a GPT disk with no BIOS Boot Partition, and you've booted in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode.\n\n\nThere are a number of possible solutions to your problem:\n\n\n*\n\n*Switch to an EFI-mode boot -- Given no other information about your setup, this is the safest approach. You may need to re-create your installation disk to support EFI-mode booting, though, or change your firmware settings to ensure that the computer boots the installer in EFI mode. Rufus includes, IIRC, three options for boot modes and partition table types, so you can re-run it with the option to use GPT for (U)EFI-mode booting, then try again. Note, though, that if you pre-partitioned your target disk, you may need to tweak that configuration to include an ESP. Make it a FAT partition (I recommend 550 MiB in size) and mark it as an ESP by giving it a \"boot flag\" (in parted or GParted) or by giving it a type code of EF00 (in gdisk, cgdisk, or sgdisk).\n\n*Create a BIOS Boot Partition -- If you're not booting any other OS, or if you're certain any other OS(es) on the disk are booting in BIOS mode, you can create a BIOS Boot Partition. This is normally a ~1 MiB partition that's identified by having the \"bios_grub flag\" set in parted or GParted or by having a type code of EF02 in gdisk or its relatives. Do not go this route if you've got another OS on the disk that's already booting in EFI mode and if you want to dual-boot with Ubuntu.\n\n*Convert the disk to use MBR -- If the disk has no other OS(es) on it at all, then you can probably convert it to use MBR rather than GPT. You can do this destructively with parted or GParted by creating a new partition table. (These tools call MBR \"msdos.\") You can often convert non-destructively with gdisk, although there are caveats; see the gdisk documentation for details. When the disk is converted to MBR form, you can install using your current installation medium. This approach is likely to create huge new problems if you're already booting another OS from the disk. Also, this approach is likely impractical if the disk is over 2 TiB in size or if it uses 4096-byte logical sectors (as do many external disks and a few bleeding-edge internal disks).\n\n\nIf you need more help deciding what to do, please post more details about your current situation -- in particular, what (if any) other OS(es) you're booting from the disk, and what size and type of disk (internal/external, spinning disk/SSD) you're trying to use. Current partitioning details may also be helpful.\n", "Q: Cannot connect to internal IP on interface I am running Ubuntu Server 16.04.\nI have a static IP assigned to the network interface on the server.\nThis IP is routable from outside the LAN\nI am wanting to access the same server from the internal LAN via a private IP address as well.\nNetwork interface is referred to as eth0\nI added this to my /etc/network/interfaces config\nauto eth0:1\niface eth0:1 inet static\naddress 192.163.1.153\nnetmask 255.255.255.0\ngateway 192.168.1.3\ndns-nameservers 192.168.1.3\n\nWith this added, should I be able to access my Ubuntu server from the internal LAN as well?\nI did notice when running systemctl restart networking I get the following error:\nRTNETLINK answers: File exists\nJun 29 18:37:28 confluence ifup[2522]: Failed to bring up eth0:1.\n\nSo I have to assume that this is why its not listening on the private IP.

Ubuntu was an upstart system for just under a decade, and the behaviour of the service command on Ubuntu has for all those years not resembled what you are expecting.  One can see the upstart behaviour of the service command in the image in How do I get service command to print output in 15.10? .\nThe answer is pretty much the same for you as for the people with Ubuntu version 15.10 last year:\nYou are using Ubuntu version 16.10, a systemd operating system.  Your system service management is no longer performed by upstart (or whatever utility did it on whatever non-Ubuntu operating system you had before).  It is performed by systemd.\nThe service command may be the same … but the Debian/Ubuntu service command is a shell script that tries to auto-detect whether upstart or systemd is the running system service manager, and run the actual native service management commands for upstart and systemd.  It executes two pretty much entirely different code paths for upstart and for systemd.\nupstart's native service management commands are initctl start, initctl stop, initctl status and so forth.  Those print messages as they go.\nsystemd's native service management commands are systemctl start, systemctl stop, systemctl status and so forth.  Those print no output as they operate.\nFurther reading\n\n\n*\n\n*https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/233840/5132\n\n*https://askubuntu.com/a/621209/43344\n\n*https://askubuntu.com/a/613814/43344\n\n*`service` no longer gives useful output (except with status) in 15.04?\n\nA: Actually you don't need an OK output. No output means OK. When a service doesn't start properly Ubuntu show you something like this:\n\nJob for php5.6-fpm.service failed because the control process exited\n  with error code. See \"systemctl status php5.6-fpm.service\" and\n  \"journalctl -xe\" for details.\n\nIn my case this example was a misconfiguration on my php-fpm.conf that unabling the service to start.

And, chmod does not change the permission.\n\nI'm using Ubuntu 16.04 and the Kernel version is 4.4.0-24-generic.\n\nA: On one hand I believe that Nautilus mounts volumes via udisksctl, the udisks cli-tool. \nOn the other hand, if I am not mistaken udev rules were planned for hot-plug devices only. So if yr volume to be mounted is an internal drive, inserting an fstab entry with the noauto option will prevent it from being mounted automatically at boot or via $ mount -a in terminal. \nYr /etc/fstab should also arrange for mounting yr NTFS drive with the required options.

Restart Firefox in normal mode.\n\n*Re-enable a few add-ons/plug-ins and restart Firefox.\n\n*If Firefox runs without issues, go back to step 4.\nIf the just enabled add-ons/plug-ins seem to cause problems:\n\n*Start Firefox in safe mode (see steps 1–2).\n\n*Disable all but one of the add-ons/plug-ins enabled in step 4. Go back to step 5 and repeat until you can narrow down the issues to a single (or more rarely multiple) add-on or plug-in.\nOnce you isolated the problematic add-on/plug-in, please open a new question to ask how to deal with that.\n", "Q: How can I remove the previous owner Adm account. So I can make changes to my P.C. Brought it from a pawn shop Need to remove User. I bought this P.C from a pawn shop , and, it still had a Adm, user account attached. Therefore I can't make any changes to the P.C. Was hoping that you all could help me with that? \n\nA: I would reinstall Ubuntu. It would be pretty silly to recustomized the current Ubuntu to your needs. You reinstall by downloading the ISO, and wiping the disk in installation. \n", "Q: Recoll - how to exclude indexing everything, then I'll add only a couple back in How do I set Recoll to exclude everything? I will then add a small number of directories. But I mostly want it to NOT index most of the computer.\nI currently have the default excluded directory in Skipped path:\n/media\nAnd I have 2 folders in Top directories (which I understand will overwrite anything in the Skipped path):\n/home/mary/Mango\n/home/mary/Pineapple\nI want to have all of the rest of the computer NOT be indexed.\nWhat would I add to the Skipped path to do that?\nThank you.\n\nA: In recoll, you configure starting directories. So if you just want to index two of them, specify them as starting directories.\nSee topdirs in official documentation:\n\nParameters affecting what documents we index\ntopdirs\nSpace-separated list of files or directories to recursively index. Default to\n  ~ (indexes $HOME). You can use symbolic links in the list, they will be\n  followed, independently of the value of the followLinks variable.\n[ . . . ]\nfollowLinks\nFollow symbolic links during indexing. The default is to ignore symbolic\n  links to avoid multiple indexing of linked files. No effort is made to avoid\n  duplication when this option is set to true. This option can be set\n  individually for each of the 'topdirs' members by using sections. It can not\n  be changed below the 'topdirs' level. Links in the 'topdirs' list itself are\n  always followed.\n\nIt's also in the GUI under \"Preferences\" -> \"Index configuration\".\n\n"]
