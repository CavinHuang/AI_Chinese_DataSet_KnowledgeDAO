["Q: How to type in Mac window? I want to enter a simple adb shell command, so I navigated to ...\\sdk\\platform-tools\\adb.exe, and opened it. However, I am unable to type in it! \n\nI am a new Mac user after recently moving from Windows, and am unsure why I can't type in the adb. What's wrong?\n\nA: By clicking on a unix executable, you run it with the exit argument.  If you scroll up to the top you will see something like this:\n.../Development/adt-bundle-mac-x86_64-20140702/sdk/platform-tools/adb ; exit;\n\nThe way to run a shell tool is to open terminal (hit command+space and type Terminal then enter)\nthen something like:\ncd /wherever/you/have installed/your sdk/platform-tools/\n./adb shell\n\ntip: start typing the directory name then hit tab for completion\n\nA: Firstly, Macs run binaries and not .exe files.\nThis adb is a binary, and must take options. \nOpen Terminal, from /Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app and you should see something like this (colors should be different): \nNow, type in adb and press return. You should see the same output as you saw in your screenshot. Now, to run the command (the highlighted text in the background), copy (⌘+C) and paste (⌘+V) that text into the terminal window. Everything that follows adb are called \"arguments\", like modifiers that affect what the command does. This is quite common in shell commands.\n   adb shell pm clear com.android.vending\n  |-V-||---------------V-----------------|\n Command            Arguments\n\nAlternatively, if you have a binary in a specific location, do: (./ executes a binary)\ncd /path/to/the/binary\n./binary-name (arguments)\n\nSide note: autocompletion can be very helpful in long directory names: by typing in a fragment of a name, then hitting Tab, autocompletion will fill in the rest of the fragment (assuming there are no similarly named items). Pressing Tab twice will show you what autocompletion can fill in.\n$ cd /Users/Ha *presses tab*\n$ cd /Users/Harry/\n\nOR\n\n$ cd /Users/H *presses tab twice*\nHarry/ Henry/ Hagrid/\n$ cd /Users/H\n\n", "Q: How to overlay multiple graphs from Apple Health data With Apple Health in iOS 9, how can I see the interaction between multiple data categories? For example, if I enter data for menstruation and sexual activity, it would be nice to see a graph with both of those overlaid on one another.\n\nA: The feature you're describing doesn't exist in the Health app. However, it's possible there's some App Store app that reads such data from HealthKit and can display a combined chart.\n", "Q: Transferring Files Between Two Separate (not connected to the same network) Computers? I need to send a colleague a relatively large application (>5GB), and was thinking of how I could go about sending it. Cloud-based services such as DropBox won't work because the file is much bigger than the storage, Gmail won't allow me to send files larger than 25Mb, and using a regular USB Flash Drive would take much too long.\nWhat I want to know if it is possible to transfer the files between the two computers without needing to be on the same network (For reference both of us are using MacBook Pro's, and we're a couple of states apart). I've tried using \n    telnet,\n   ssh, and\n    ftp, but it seems that all of them require the two computers to be part of the same local area network (I was trying to have the other end connect to my computer by giving them the IP address of my computer). I was wondering if it were possible to somehow make my MacBook act as a server, have the other end connect, and then transfer the files. Is something like this feasible? Thank you in advance!\n\nA: The classic way of copying files between two *NIX boxes (Mac, BSD or some Linux) is via the scp command.\nThis method requires knowledge of the public IP address of the target device, or an IP address within the same VPN. A tool which can help accessing computers over the internet is a Dynamic DNS service, like No-IP or DynDNS. No-IP offers a free service which is more than adequate for your purposes (used it myself). This gives your machine a publicly accessible hostname.\nOnce you've established the target device's IP, you need to fire up your Terminal, and call the scp command. For the sake of simplicity we'll assume that the target IP is 8.8.8.8, and that you've already set up SSH keys.\nYour scp command should look something like this:\n>> scp /source/file/here remoteuser@8.8.8.8:/target/file/here\n\nor when using a hostname:\n>> scp /source/file/here remoteuser@hostname.net:/target/file/here\n\nIf you check scp man pages, it tells you that the first parameter (the source file) should also be defined with a user and a machine. When using a local file, the necessary details are added for you, so you only have to provide the file path.\nHere is a link to the scp man page: http://linux.die.net/man/1/scp\nAnd here's a link to a tutorial: https://kb.iu.edu/d/agye\nBonus: if you need to sync a larger number of files more often, maybe something like BitTorrent Sync could be of interest to you. I haven't really tried it myself with larger files tho.\n\nA: The inherent problem with using command line tools like scp or sftp is that even after you get your external IP address, you need to configure your firewall/router to allow that traffic to get to your computer.  But do you control (own) that firewall/router?  If you don't, then how do you make the connection?\nHave you tried Skype?\nI once used Skype to transfer an ISO that was about 2GB in size.  I was in a similar situation as you but while I controlled my router, my friend did not control the one he was behind and the owner was unwilling to help out.  Walking him through the process of entering commands on Terminal was proving to be difficult so I had to find something else.  Using Skype, I was able to transfer the ISO.\nI just went on their site and checked....\n\nUnfortunately, I can't test right now as I don't have someone available (with time) to test out sending a large file.\n\nAnother option is TeamViewer.\nWith it, you can not only remote control another computer over the Internet, you can transfer files.  A quick look on their website reveals:\n\nThey support virtually every platform - Mac, Windows, Linux, even Blackberry (yeah, BB!).  It's also Free for personal use.  They even have a \"portable version\" that doesn't get installed.  You can just copy the executable to a USB stick and use it on any computer without it modifying any files.\n", "Q: Skype on ios7/iPhone4 completely useless I have an old iPhone4 with iOS7. It does, until now, what I need it to do so I've not upgraded.\nUnfortunately, the last few versions of Skype are killing the phone. I mean the whole OS is completely unresponsive. Even volume controls take seconds to respond!!\nI've tried killing all other apps with no difference. At least if Skype behaved itself it would be some consolation but even that being active is completely useless. Even calling the test service makes it behave oddly. It says it is ringing, and the audio ringing is playing but then the call is answered while it still says it is ringing and playing the ringing tone. \nEven the audio is breaking up and parts are coming through out of order!\nIt is a complete and utter mess!!. I am NOT getting a new phone just for Skype but I've got credit through Skype Out and need to be able to use it.\nI've send feedback to Microsoft through the app a version or two ago, nothing.\nI was running 6.8 but I've gone to the app store and installed the latest version, 6.12 for my OS and no difference.\nI've tried restarting the phone and again no difference. \nIt used to work just fine before they did the UI changes and then undid them. \nIs anyone else having this problem? I've even contemplated installing an older version through some hack I found but it is time consuming to get it done...\n\nA: After spending a considerable amount of time, I managed to install a much older version of Skype using the Windows version of the guide mentioned here,\nhttp://lifehacker.com/download-old-versions-of-ios-apps-with-a-clever-workaro-1749950092\nI was lucky that my first attempt gave me a version that worked so I only had to do it once. \nFor anyone else interested, in the list of softwareVersionExternalIdentifiers I selected 756732646 which corresponded to Skype version 5.7.120\nHTH\n\nA: I encountered the same issues with the current available version of Skype on iOS 7 on an iPhone 4.\nThe solution when using OS X is found in this Video:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xL70CLXhF9U\nand this tutorial:\nhttp://www.idownloadblog.com/2015/12/25/how-to-download-older-versions-of-ios-apps/\nwhich describes the steps to \n\n\n*\n\n*install an SSL proxy called Charles\n\n*find the identifier of the previous working version of the App\n\n*use the proxy to redirect iTunes to download that version\n\n*download & install the previous version of the App\n\n\nI can confirm, that installing Skype version 5.7.120 using this method fixes the issues on iPhone 4 and still works fine in June 2016.\n", "Q: Does the iPhone SE have Sapphire glass? Does the iPhone SE use stronger glass on its screen than iPhone 5S? Does it have Sapphire glass similar to iPhone 6 & 6S.\n\nA: Nope, just plain old Gorilla Glass.\n\nApple would have put it here, and it wasn't announced during the keynote.\n\nA: Yes the iPhone SE has a Sapphire Crystal lens cover\nhttp://www.apple.com/iphone-se/specs/\n", "Q: Keep Mac mini on Wi-Fi (for screen-sharing), but disable internet access... How? I have a Mac mini, running El Capitan, which I use as a media server. I access/control it and control it via screen-sharing. The Mac Mini has no display attached, so it must remain connected to my Wi-Fi or I can't access/control it.\nThere is however no need for it to be permanently connected to the internet. Beyond the security risk, it also uses up bandwidth for background tasks which I have no use for.\nI would like to disable web access, while keeping Wifi connectivity. Possible? How?\n\nA: There are a couple of things you can do, but by far the easiest is to just manually configure your IP address (don't use DHCP) and leave the router field blank.  See below...\n\nBefore you select \"Manually\" in the drop down, take note of the IP address that was assigned to it by DHCP.  Then when you select \"Manually\" just re-enter that same IP address.\nWith the Router field empty, your Mac Mini will not know how to get out to the Internet.\nUpdate:  As pointed out by user3439894 in the comments, reusing the IP address from the DHCP pool could pose a problem.  To avoid this, assign it an address outside the pool.\nMost routers will have a starting address (Netgear's typically start their addressing at 192.168.1.100 and assign 50 or 100 address).  So you either have addresses up to 192.168.1.49 or .199.  To make sure you don't cause conflict, just assign it an address either higher than or lower than the pool (i.e. 192.168.1.30 or 192.168.1.210)\n\nA: Remove the default gateway from its routing table, so that it can't route outside your local network. It will probably be set by DHCP, so you'll need to run a script regularly to delete it again.\n", "Q: maspushagent using CPU [retina MacBook Pro 15\", Late 2013, OS X 10.11.4]\nI always keep Activity Monitor running, and just noticed that CPU usage was up significantly. The process maspushagent (owned by me) has now been running at ~123% CPU for close to an hour now. The requisite googling doesn't turn up anything useful. What does this do, and will it quit any time soon, or should I kill/reboot/?\n\nA: The maspushagent is the \"push agent\" for the \"Mac App Store\". Being a \"push agent\" means that it used for receiving/processing notifications from Apple's servers. It could for example be notifications about an update.\nThe program is automatically started by launchd when a notification is received by the Mac destined for the Mac App Store.\nTherefore it should be safe to simply kill the mapushagent if it is behaving like you describe. Hopefully that fixes the issue for you.\n", "Q: Display photos from iPad on TV without Internet connection Is it possible to show photos from an iPad Air on a TV without an internet connection, Wi-Fi router or 3G data plan subscription (i.e. the iPad is completely offline)?\n\nA: Here's one way...\nIf your TV supports HDMI then use a Lightning Digital AV Adapter.\n\nUse the Lightning Digital AV Adapter with your iPhone, iPad, or iPod\n  with Lightning connector. The Lightning Digital AV Adapter supports\n  mirroring of what is displayed on your device screen — including apps,\n  presentations, websites, slideshows, and more — to your HDMI-equipped\n  TV, display, projector, or other compatible display in up to 1080p HD.\nIt also outputs video content — movies, TV shows, captured video — to\n  your big screen in up to 1080p HD. Simply attach the Lightning Digital\n  AV Adapter to the Lightning connector on your device and then to your\n  TV or projector via an HDMI cable (sold separately).\n\nYou also need a HDMI Cable.\n\nAnother possible way is to use a Lightning to VGA Adapter.\n\nUse the Lightning to VGA Adapter with your iPhone, iPad, or iPod with\n  Lightning connector. The Lightning to VGA Adapter supports mirroring\n  of what is displayed on your device screen — including apps,\n  presentations, websites, slideshows, and more — to your VGA-equipped\n  TV, display, projector, or other compatible display in up to 1080p HD.\nIt also outputs video content — movies, TV shows, captured video — to\n  your big screen in up to 1080p HD. Simply attach your Lightning to VGA\n  Adapter to the Lightning connector on your device and then to your TV\n  or projector via a VGA cable (sold separately).\n\nYou also need a VGA Cable.\n\nA: Yes you can share content without an active internet connection. Once you have your Apple TV and your iOS device signed into iCloud and AirPlay works - you can disconnect both from the network and they will work ad-hoc to make a bluetooth/WiFi connection to stream content (sound and images) from the iPad to the Apple TV.\nWhether you just disconnect the router and there is a local network - that will also be used for AirPlay - but an internet connection is only needed to arrange the initial account sign in one time.\nHave a look at: Use AirPlay to wirelessly stream content from your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204289\n\nWith AirPlay, you can stream music, photos, and videos to your Apple\n  TV, or stream music to your AirPort Express or AirPlay-enabled\n  speakers. And with AirPlay Mirroring, you can display your iOS screen\n  on your Apple TV.\n\nPay specific attention to the peer-to-peer AirPlay section of the above article.\n", "Q: Apple Game Center - Unlinking games I have games challenging me that I have not had on my phone for years...Please help me remove them as it drives me crazy!\n\nA: Simply open Game Center on your iPhone, switch to the games tab and swipe left on the games you want to remove.

Would there be any way for me to get the app from my iPad and unpack it somehow? I've looked the question up already and some have said that you can unpack it with some third party software, but it doesn't say what the software actually is.\nI would really appreciate some help with this. I have a version of the app backed up, but it's much older and I would rather not redo things if I didn't have to.\n\nA: Simple answer is no.\nSwift (and objective C) is compiled into machine code and much of the naming is thrown away and optimisation will also alter the control structure.\nExperienced reverse engineers can get some form of code back but it is not very readable or useful in most cases.\nWhen you start any coding project the first thing you do is set up source code control so you can take snapshots of code.\nNote that the \" wiped without my knowledge and with no warning\" should be expected on any computer. Hardware can fail let alone errors an people mistakenly or deliberately removing files.\n", "Q: If I turn off imessage and get a message will I see it when I turn imessage back on?

I've turned it back on since but still don't see a message :/\n\nA: You will only get the message, if you still had iMessage enabled on another device, so your cell/e-mail was still registered with iMessage. Then it will sync the message from this other iMessage enabled device.\nOtherwise she wouldn't have been able to send you an iMessage, only a SMS or e-mail.\n", "Q: For security reasons, what should I block with the firewall? For security reasons, what should I block with the firewall?\nI'm just interested in the system itself, not additional installed software. For example, I'd like my system to synchronize the clock or download system updates in the background.\nOr, to turn the question around:\nWhat on my computer would need incoming connections?\nI don't use my Mac as a web server, but is there anything else that needs to receive incoming connections?\n\nA: Well, basically the standard Firewall blocks incoming connections only. So as long as any network accesses are triggered by your Mac (as in the case of clock synchronization or software downloads/updates), you can block all incoming connections.\nOnce you have the firewall set up if you install anything that requires a connection you will be prompted to allow or deny that connection - so turning it on has little downside and lots of upside from a security standpoint.\n", "Q: Import Safari data into Safari Technology Preview I have installed the Safari Technology Preview and whilst everything works fine, there is a lot of data which is missing and not been migrated.\nBookmarks, Reading List and AutoFill have been transferred automatically through iCloud, and eventually History through iCloud too, but I would like to also transfer the following data:\n\n\n*\n\n*Cookies\n\n*Preferences\n\n*Extensions (specifically the extension preferences — I can reinstall the actual extensions)\n\n\nHow can I export my Safari browser data into the Safari Technology Preview?\n\nA: Coping ~/Library/Safari to ~/Library/SafariTechnologyPreview works for me.\nOn the command line, run:\ncp -R ~/Library/Safari ~/Library/SafariTechnologyPreview\n\n", "Q: Deleting iPhone pics using my Mac?

When I connect my Mac via Ethernet it has 5x more maximum speed than when connecting it with the same Ethernet to the latest Airport Express. Is this normal (and if so, why)?\n\nA: It is probably because you are connecting to a gigabit switch when referring to \"direct Ethernet\" and when you connect to your Airport Express via Ethernet, it is connected at 100Mb or \"Fast Ethernet\"\nFrom Apple's website for the Airport Express:\n\nI would check the switch you are using to connect \"direct\" and confirm that it is a gigabit switch.\n", "Q: USB game controller not detected Since upgrading my version of OSX, my computer no longer detects a USB game controller.

Convert aac/m4a files to mp3 for best compatibility with most sound systems. \n\nBut you have to remember that this app:\n\n*Can not convert DRM protected files.\n\nSo:\n\n\n*\n\n*In iTunes, you have to add this this problematic song to a new playlist\n\n*you have to check this playlist in iTunes Export App\n\n*next you have to click Export button\n\n*you will see export options\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*In here you can choose conversion options etc\n\n*Next\n\n*you have to choose export location\n\n*and finally, after a few seconds you have a new copy of your song\n\n\nNow you can import it to your iTunes library, and try to sync it with your iPod.\nBut... iTunes Export is a paid app (quite expensive for such a little task), so if you won't be using it regulary to perform similar actions, all above soulution is not worthy your attention;-)\nI'm curious if anybody will suggest a better (cheeper) way to do it. \n", "Q: Zip email with con AppleScript I need to zip all email that have in the body this words \"Identificativo messaggio: CA3DA789.008822A5.C33F80AE\".\nI have many email in AppleMail  so i think if it's possible to create an AppleScript that select all email that have in their body this Word \"Identificativo messaggio: CA3DA789.008822A5.C33F80AE\".\nOnce AppleScript find these mails,  unzip them and tell me where Save the file zip and with witch name.\nIt's possible to create this AppleScript ?\nEvery day i must zip the email and with search box i need of much time. So i think to use an AppleScript that work in this mode: I select an mail that contain \"identificativo n. *****\" and Applescript find all Mail with the same \"identificativo n. *****\". After selected mail, i could zip these files or stamp with their attachements.\n\nA: It's certainly possible to do this with AppleScript, but depending on how often you need to do this it might be simpler to just\n\n\n*\n\n*Use the search box within Mail to list all mails containing this specific string\n\n*Drag them into a folder on the Desktop\n\n*Compress/zip that folder\n\n", "Q: Iphone lost photos and videos when jailbreak I need your urgent help.

In order to do that, follow these steps:\n\nAs you can see, this is from apple's website, so those are the directions.\nIf you did not create a backup before jail breaking, it is going to take a more complicated route to find your photos and videos, if it's even possible at that point.\nHope this helps!\n", "Q: Reinstall Office for Mac 2011 I downloaded Office 2011 to my old computer that crashed and no way to retrieve HD contents. I lost everything. Now I have a new computer MacBook Pro and I have the key number that I had printed out before.  Maybe this sounds dumb but can I download the program again on this new computer since I have the key number? How do I do it?\n\nA: To re-download Office for Mac 2011 go to Microsoft's Office for Mac 2011 Download Site and after choosing a language version, entering your serial number, and completing the CAPTCHA you should get a link.\nIn the common browsers like Safari, Firefox and Google Chrome the site looks like scam but it seems to be legit.\n", "Q: How to remove a keychain in OS X?

I had the SAME frustrating problem with the GOOGLE CHROME APP and I solved it this way:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Settings --> Storage & iCloud Usage\n\n*Go to the section that says ICLOUD\n\n*Click on Manage Storage\n\n*Click on Joana's (Your name) iPhone\n\n*At the Backup Options turn off Chrome\n\n*Go to the App Store and try to download the app again. Hopefully, it will start downloading! For me this solved the problem.\n\n\nA: These might look obvious but it's always best to check:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure you're connected to the internet and that you have a good, strong signal.\n\n*Do you have enough space available on your device?  You didn't mention the device or space used but if you don't have enough space available for the app, it won't download.\n\n*Do other apps download?  Try downloading a free app.  This makes sure your network settings are not messed up.\n\n*Reboot your device and try again.\n\n*Reset your Network settings to the defaults.  Go to Settings --> General --> Reset --> Reset Network Settings.  You'll lose the login user id & password from every network you've been on, so be prepared with that info in order to log in to your wifi networks.\n\n*If all those fail, it's time to contact Apple.\n\n\nA: Choose any new app and try to install that. And as that install is going on, hit the cloud download on the app that was frozen/stuck. With any luck the frozen app will start downloading too. This is how it got sorted on my side today. Hope it helps. \n\nA: I switched off the iCloud Drive and reinstalled from the Applestore the app which was still showing the cloud icon. It worked because it showed the latest update instead of the old one which had not changed when the app opened.\n\nA: i had the same prob for watsapp app try checking ur apple id it must be on verfication try siging out nd signing inn ur apple id and then download. also check your i cloud back ups \n\nA: Try to clear up the memory, at least 1 GB. Then, try to download. \n\nA: If you have time warner cable/spectrum or a new router or internet, you must login and make sure your device is trusted. I did this and it fixed everything. \n", "Q: Macbook Air 13\" 2014 battery drain Okay well so this Macbook i have isn't giving me a full time its rather dying our very fast!! even after i don't know resetting the smc and the nvram and i have no idea whats going help its really urgent!! \n\nA: Sadly the solution you seek is to stop using Firefox. It drains your battery much faster than using Safari. \nClose Firefox then use some Apple products and run them until your battery is very low. Then record that time. If that time is less than advertised then that is when you have a problem with the battery. \nThere is no issue with your computer if your battery is drained and you are using thrid party apps.\n", "Q: Why does Apple TV not stop my Mac from sleeping? When using Home Sharing on Apple TV 3rd gen, the Mac will fall asleep even though it is needed to stream content. So in the middle of a movie the connection will be lost because the Mac goes to sleep.\nWhy does it not stay awake? It seems like a big oversight on Apple's part.\n\nA: You might want to try going to \n\n\n*\n\n*System Preferences\n\n*Energy Saver\n\n*Then set Display Sleep to never\n\n\nIf you find the need to put the display to sleep because you want to have the computer on and running for whatever reason then I would suggest going to the Screen Saver options and enabling Hot Corners. In that screen you can make the display go to sleep or trigger a screen saver by moving the mouse cursor to a corner on your screen.\nSource: That is my current setup. No Display Sleep on unless I'm running a lengthy Time Machine Backup overnight.\n\nA: There is a free app called Caffeine that adds a little coffee cup to your title bar. Click on it and the Mac will never sleep. Click again and your Mac goes back to its normal sleep pattern.\n", "Q: Screen saver on remote desktop My osx box is connected to my TV via HDMI. I use \"Share Screen\" to login to the box and play a netflix video. I must have installed an update or something because suddenly, when I close the \"Share screen\" window, the TV will go straight to screen saver. Previously it would let me keep watching Netflix using my Macbook to control. Any suggestions?\n\nA: After an afternoon of tinkering, a semi-solution.\nI found I can fix the automatic launching of the screen saver when closing a screen share by shutting down and restarting the screen sharing service by issuing these commands in a terminal window:\n\nsudo launchctl unload\n  /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.screensharing.plist\nsudo launchctl load -w\n  /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.screensharing.plist\n\n(See Restart Screen Sharing Service on Mac mini Server for more details)\nThis can be accomplished remotely by via SSH as well.\nAnother observation, the automatic launching of the screen saver only seems to \"stick\" once I open a screen share while a screen saver is running.  It's almost as if the machine \"remembers\" if you logged on while a screen saver is running and \"decides\" to start it back up when you logout... forever.\nFrom then on the screen saver will launch every time you close a screen share session (until you restart the machine, or the service)\nI hope this helps with watching Netflix. Sadly it doesn't help me much since I often launch a pretty screen saver on the TV just for aesthetics.  After that to go back to 'normal' I have relaunch the sharing service, which is highly annoying.  Here's hoping someone has a better solution...\n\nOld answer:\nNot an answer, but acknowledgement that someone else is having the same problem and some more specifics.  Hopefully someone can help.\nSame setup:  TV connected to my Mac via HDMI.  I use screen sharing to control it.\nMore Info:  \n1- The screen saver only launches when the last screen sharing client closes. (For example, if I'm using screen share on a laptop and iTeleport on my phone, if I close one or the other, the screen saver doesn't start up.  The screen saver will only start when the very last client disconnects.)\n2- The screen saver launches even if the mouse is placed in a 'hot corner' set to 'Disable Screensaver'\n3- If I reboot the machine, or disable and then re-enable screen sharing (using my connect mouse/keyboard) the problem goes away, until I run a screen saver once.  From that point on it will \"auto-launch\" the screen saver, until I reboot or disable/re-enable sharing.\n4- I agree w/ OP that this problem must have come through an update or something because I have not noticed this behavior until just a few days ago after several years of using my mac mini with a TV connected as a monitor via HDMI.\n", "Q: How to get rid of my spamming notification? The DivX player has installed a junk notification on my Mac saying:\n\nA new version of DivX is available.\n\nas shown below:\n\nThis stupid notification bumps up every hour or so, and there is no way to turn it off (there's no disable option when I click on it's icon). I don't want and don't need their software. I can't see the player in my Notification panel.\n\nQuestion: How to prevent DivX from spamming me with notifications? \n\nA: Removing DivX and DivXUpdate\nIf you'd like to remove the DivX app along with its DivXUpdate, you need to uninstall the software.\nUninstaller\nUninstaller you can find in /Applications/DivX folder and run Uninstall DivX for Mac.app.\nManual Removal\nIf above folder and uninstaller doesn't exist, just remove:\n/Library/Application Support/DivX/DivXUpdate.app\n\nTo remove the associated launchd services, check first which one are registered by this Terminal command:\nlaunchctl list | grep divx\n\nThen disable or remove them. The following two commands will remove the jobs:\nlaunchctl remove com.divx.update.agent\nlaunchctl remove com.divx.dms.agent\n\nAfter you may consider removing these service files from /Library/LaunchAgents (called divx).\nsudo rm /Library/LaunchAgents/com.divx.update.agent.plist # For Update\nsudo rm /Library/LaunchAgents/com.divx.dms.agent.plist # For DivXMediaServer\n\nKilling notification popup\nThen kill the annoying update app, type this command in Terminal:\nkillall DivXUpdate\n\n", "Q: Expand Finder column width with keyboard shortcut I can expand the column width in Finder (OS X El Capitan, MacBook Pro) by clicking on the right-hand line of the column (see red arrow in screenshot).

I received the email in the screenshot, which I'm fairly sure is a scam. I clicked on the attachment in the Mail app on my iPhone 6 (iOS 9.2). Note that I didn't unzip the attachment. Should I be concerned that clicking on the attachment will be harmful?\n\n\nA: You should be safe on your iPhone, normally these scam mails hope to be open on PCs where they can run scripts. your iPhone will not open the zip automatically, you would have to use a third party app.\nYou should be fine.\n\nA: You should be fine - Apple are pretty solid at blocking anything nefarious from running that shouldn't be.\nIf you want to be extra careful I'd get onto a different device than your phone (a desktop/laptop computer) and change your email password from there - just in case something bad was left behind.

Last night both started offering me an upgrade to iOS 9.3 again, even going so far as to download the 1.5GB update file. \nIs anyone else seeing this behavior? Any idea how to resolve the issue short of installing the update? I would venture a guess that it's a server-side issue at Apple that I can't do too much about, but I'm wondering if anyone else has any ideas. \n\nA: Update (March 31, 2016): Apple has released iOS 9.3.1 (13E238***) to fix more issues. If you update to that, this issue will be resolved.\n\nOriginal Answer\nThere were some issues in the original release of iOS 9.3 (13E233*) for older devices. A newer build (13E237**) was released on March 28, 2016.\nYou can check your installed build in Settings > General > About > Version. If your installed build is 13E233*, that may be the reason for your indication. Whether you choose to update is your choice. If you choose to not, then you may have to just deal with the notifications (until the next real update).\nNote: Build numbers vary per device.\n13E233*: all devices except iPhone 6s/6s Plus and iPad Pro (9.7 inch).\n13E234*: iPhone 6s, iPhons 6s Plus, iPad Pro (9.7 inch).\n13E236**: iPad 2 (3G, GSM).\n13E237**: all iPads except iPad Air 2, iPad Pro (9.7 and 12.9), iPad mini 3 and iPad mini 4. all iPhones except iPhone 6/6 Plus, iPhone 6s/6s Plus, and iPhone SE. iPod touch (5th Generation).\n13E238***: all devices currently supported by Apple.\n", "Q: AppleID Not been accepted in XCode account pane I've notived my Apple ID is not been accepted within XCode when I try add an Apple ID in the XCode accounts pane of preferences.\nI have tested the account details in both the member ceter and itunes connect sites and the account is fine.\nWhen I add the account details and click 'Add' I get the message:\njohn@abcdef.com could not sign in.

After I press the power button, I can hear the chime and the computer proceed to go to a blank gray screen immediately. The screen has no apple logo or loading bar.\nWhat I tried as of now:\n\n\n*\n\n*Booting in recovery by holding CMD+R -- no effect, blank screen\n\n*Booting in single-user mode by holding CMD+S -- no effect, blank screen\n\n*Booting in verbose mode by holding CMD+V -- no effect, blank screen\n\n*Booting in safe mode by holding Shift -- no effect, blank screen\n\n*Booting in hardware diagnosis mode by holding D -- no effect, blank screen\n\n*Resetting PRAM by holding CMD+ALT+P+R -- reboots, chime again and then blank screen (from this I deduced that the keyboard actually works)\n\n*Resetting SMC by holding Shift+Alt+Control while pressing the power button, then pressing the power button alone -- no effect, blank screen\n\n*Choosing another booting drive or recovery partition by holding Alt -- no effect, blank screen\n\n\nIs there something else I could try to get past this gray screen and try other recovery procedures?\nThanks.\nEDIT: placing another hard drive in the macbook made it boot properly, so the issue doesn't lie in the rest of the hardware. Now can I recover the data on the malfunctioning drive?\n\nA: Since you are talking data recovery now, until you get all your data back DO NOT WRITE TO THE DRIVE YOU ARE RECOVERING UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, EVER, OR YOU WILL LOSE ANY AND ALL DATA ON THE DRIVE WITH ABSOLUTELY ZERO CHANCE OF RECOVERY!!!\nIf you really want to play it safe you should send your drive to a data recovery service. Those are expensive but you have a better chance at getting your data back. A good data recovery service can not only get data out of a drive with messed up metadata, but also a drive suffered from mild to medium damage.\nThe best bet without contacting a data recovery service is to boot from another device and image your drive off to another storage media. Then you can try to mount the disk image and fish your data out of it. Some Linux-based tools can be very useful.\nI would suggest against using that drive ever even after you have recovered all your data. That puppy have suffered from some damage and will have a shortened lifespan. For laptops since physical movement is a daily occurrence I suggest you get an SSD for it. Not only will your laptop load faster the SSD is virtually immune to most physical trauma that can damage a hard drive so it will survive longer. By the way you can force TRIM under El Capitan so there will be no long-term speed and lifespan penalty.\n", "Q: AirPort Time Capsule Connection to Internet I bought an AirPort Time Capsule to store my backups and read that it can also improve the speed of my Wi Fi; I have a mini Mac, a mini iPad2, an iPhone5 and until now I go in Internet with the Wi Fi Modem-router provided by the local telephone Company.\nWould it be better to connect the Airport directly to Internet instead of using the modem-router, or do I have to use the modem anyway and the AirPort as an extension for all my Apple devices, they profit from the enhanced signal?\n\nA: First - download and read the setup guides for your Time Capsule. See help.apple.com for your location and your model of time capsule.\nYou should aim to replace your current WiFi (from your modem) with a new WiFi network (from the Time Capsule). You can extend your modem's WiFi with your Time Capsule's WiFi but this is usually more complicated and will not improve anything.\nYour time capsule should be set to create a WiFi network, select that WiFi network on your Mac Mini and you will be able to use the Time Machine backup function. \nConnect your Time Capsule to your modem router with an ethernet cable so that the Time Capsule can connect to the internet through your telephone company's modem.\nYou can choose to set your Time Capsule to 'bridge' mode so that the DHCP connection-sharing is handled by your modem router. Or you can set your modem router to bridge mode so that the DHCP connection-sharing is handled by your Time Capsule. You may need to check with your internet provider which method is the best in your area.\nThe Apple documentation includes guides on how to set it up correctly in either mode.\nYour Time Capsule WiFi network may be quicker and faster than your modem WiFi network. This makes your local network faster, but it will not make your connection to the internet any faster.\n", "Q: AirPlay without Apple TV? Why are there AirPlay speakers or audio, but not for Video. I.e I have yet to see a single TV set support AirPlay mirroring, while many support Andriod ChromeCast type. \nIs it possible to have Video AirPlay to TV set without Apple TV, if not, is it because Apple has yet to open up the protocol? \n\nA: \"AirPlay speakers\" are to be used when you have an Apple router that's directly connected to some speakers (no TV), therefore you can only stream audio and not video. \nIf you were to connect an Apple TV to a monitor, then you can stream both audio and video, as well as mirror your iPhone/MacBook screen onto your TV. Unfortunately, without an Apple TV you cannot stream video.\n", "Q: Finder windows just show screen artefacts On our Macbook Air (Mid-2011 11\", OS X 10.9.5 Mavericks), starting a few days ago, every time we open Finder windows, the right side just shows screen artifacts/cheese.

Maybe I should upgrade to El Capitan? But why would this start happening all of a sudden?\n\n\nA: I found the solution here: https://www.maketecheasier.com/fix-google-drive-crashing-finder-in-mavericks/\n\nA number of users who have upgraded their precious Macs to Apple’s newest OS, namely OS X Mavericks have found that when they log into their systems, the Finder windows no longer run stably. Instead, it quits and relaunches repeatedly. This problem has also been mentioned again and again on Apple Support forum threads, including here and here. When this problem occurs, all Finder windows and desktop items disappear, and then after a little while, reappear.\n. . . . . . . . . . .\nThis specific problem appears to be related somehow to Google’s desktop client (current version 1.12, released on September 25) for accessing its Google Drive service. Whenever Google Drive synchronises, the folders that you have set up to sync should be showing a small sychronization icon next to them. It appears that the way Google Drive adds these sync icons to folders is the issue that is crashing Finder windows in Mavericks.\n\nThe fix/workaround is:\n\n*\n\n*Click the Google Drive menu and choose Preferences.\n\n*Uncheck the option to “Show file sync status icons and right click menu” in the Preferences window.\n\nI did that, and no more screen artifacts/freezing.\n", "Q: Mac OS X Terminal creates zero byte files I'm a font developer.

Apple sells \"carrier-specific\" versions of their phones, as well as \"sim-free\" versions.\nIf paying in full, these are the same price (e.g. a Verizon or AT&T 64GB iPhone SE costs $499, as does a sim-free 64GB iPhone SE).\nI understand that the sim-free iPhone does not work with Sprint, so if I wanted to use it on Sprint, I would have to buy the Sprint-specific version.\nBut in the case of Verizon, T-Mobile, and AT&T, why would anyone buy the carrier-specific version instead of the sim-free version?  Do they offer any advantage?  Why does Apple even sell them?\n\nA: Apple sells carrier-specific iPhone models so that the carrier can do subsidizing or financing. The carrier-specific ones comes with a pre-activated SIM for the carrier that you choose. There is no advantage other than convenience when paying in full (other than the Sprint requirement). One thing, though, is that the SIM-free version doesn't come with a SIM, so you need to get one from you carrier, which might cost money. The SIM-free and T-Mobile versions come factory unlocked, and the others might not.\n", "Q: iPhone 5s Blue Screen of Death (Water Damage) I have an interesting problem with an iPhone 5s I'm repairing for a client:\nBackground\nThe iPhone 5s was dropped in water and completely submerged for a seconds (I'm not sure if it was on or off when it fell in, but I can find out), but was quickly retrieved and still worked for a few minutes before the BSOD appeared and the iPhone restarted. My client immediately turned the iPhone off and texted me about trying to fix it, I agreed to try my best, and I received it the next day.\nAdditional Problems\nI was also told that it was having a hard time recognizing touch input, detected buttons being pressed when they weren't, and inaccurately recognized headphones being plugged into the headphone jack when they weren't.\nMy Repair\nI began to disassemble it as soon as I got home. I disconnected the digitizer assembly, took out the battery, logic board, and Lightning dock assembly. I noticed corrosion on the bottom of the board on the back , which I cleaned best I could with alcohol and a toothbrush, but is still stained and around a chip on the top of the board on the back. I cleaned the Lightning jack assembly the same way, but when I connected it to the board and tried to charge the iPhone, it didn't work. I cleaned the port on the board and it worked. After a few hours (disassembling, cleaning, testing, cleaning again, testing again, etc., then reassembling, the iPhone was at least working better than when it was brought to me and all of the above problems were fixed.\nBSOD\nHowever, upon unlocking the phone and testing it more thoroughly, the iPhone crashed with the BSOD and restarted. I timed it and it always happens between 2 and 3 minutes after being unlocked, however never appears on the lock screen.\nAdditional Info\n\n\n*\n\n*iPhone 5s is running iOS 9.2.1\n\n*No iWork apps are installed (some said that iWork apps, like Pages, caused the BSOD when syncing to iCloud)\n\n*I will try to relay any questions you have to my client\n\n\nAny idea as to what is causing the BSOD and how I should fix it?\nUpdate: I tested it with a different digitizer assembly (just the LCD and digitizer, no TouchID connected, no earpiece speaker, no front camera, nothing else) and to my amazement, it worked for almost 15 minutes before I decided to shut it off myself and put the old complete assembly back on. However, with everything (including TouchID) connected again, it went to the BSOD after a couple of minutes. I suspect TouchID.\nUpdate 2: I believe that the above update was just a coincidence, as I just got the BSOD with the cracked screen.\n\nA: After hours of testing many components, I think it's the battery at fault. Every battery has a processor inside of it which lets the iPhone know how much it's charged and handles other system-level battery stuff. The water must have majorly screwed up that processor and the battery itself, because I'll turn the iPhone on once and it'll read around 40% and it will work for 15 minutes straight, before I turn it off and then back on again. But then it'll either say something really low, like 12%, or really high, almost always in the 80%, but it will crash with the Blue Screen Of Death and restart itself. I put the battery from a family member's iPhone 5s in and it works, and no matter how many times I restart it, I get the actual charged percentage and no BSOD. I got this battery from iFixit, who I've had good luck with in the past. \n\nA: It is clear from your first post, that the battery is dead. It is not certain that a new battery will bring it to life, try it. I have seen no reports about the iFixit battery, but iFixit is a well know high quality company, so it s probably good.\n\nA: You may get help on here.

They work fine on my Mac. When I download them directly to a device through \"Copy to iBooks\" through mail or through iTunes, they read fine on the iPad and the iPhone. \nHowever, when I activate the new iCloud Books, half the time the book opens on the cover with the spinning gear. After a short time (10 seconds or so), I get the error: \"Failed to Load Book Because the Requested Resource is Missing.\"\nI am pulling out my hair trying to figure this out. I've run the ePubs through the Calibre ePub covert and even edited them in Sigil. The ePubs are perfect in direct download to the device, but about 85% of the time, they give that error whenever downloaded from iCloud Books. I've compared the ones that work to the ones that don't and can't find any differences.\nI'm totally lost. Can someone PLEASE tell me what the hell I'm doing wrong?\n\nA: The most likely reason is that you were using different versions of the same book, or two different books are name the same, something like that. The Apple Books app remembers the position for one version of the book, but can't find it in the new version, and pops up the error.\nSource: http://richardexplainseverything.blogspot.com/2016/05/fixing-failed-to-load-book-because.html\n\nA: Just delete Apple Books from the device and reinstall it.

One is to bind a hotkey that will create a reminder with a followup time of two business days.  \nI followed a guide on how to build the script and insert it into Automator found here.  The script works when running in the AppleScript application, and compiles and runs in Automator.  The service/workflow generated by Automator is saved to ~/Library/Services/ but does not show in the services menu in Apple Mail.  This article says that services for Apple Mail should be in the /System/Library/Automator folder.  I am unable to move the service to that folder as the folder is locked.  The service is set to have no input, and be in the mail application.  \nHow can I get this workflow/service to show in the mac mail services menu?\n\nA: Depending on how your script is configured, by default, any Service requires to have an item selected / highlighted (in your case, an email) as they are context sensitive.\nYou can disable this behaviour by changing the drop down field \"Service receives\" and selecting \"no input\". This obviously only applies if your script fetches input itself or doesn't need it.  \n \nUnfortunately there do seem to be weird issues when services have spaces and/or numbers in their name.\nAs stated by @gerlos, renaming them should solve the problem, but a reboot might be required (Which was the case for me).\nAs an extra;\nIf you're now finding that you don't like the name of the new service, you can change it!\nJust right click the .workflow file and select 'show package contents'.\nInside you'll find a configurable info.plist file.\nOpen it up with your favourite text or plist editor (Or just plain old TextEdit) and look for the xml key 'NSMenuItem', it should contain a key entry 'default' associated with a string, the string in question is the service's display name. \nMore information on everything that's configurable (e.g. a service description) can be found in the apple documentation here: https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/SysServices/Articles/properties.html \nTested on OS X High Sierra\n\nA: So, apparently, I had to disable rootless system integrity protection just to move the workflow file between folders.  I still hope someone finds a better way of installing services in the mail app in El Capitan, because having to do multiple reboots and disabling low level security features seems excessive when I'm just trying to pull data from two basic apps.  \nhttp://osxdaily.com/2015/10/05/disable-rootless-system-integrity-protection-mac-os-x/\n\nA: I stumbled upon this very problem recently, on MacOS 10.11 El Capitan and MacOS 10.14 Mojave. \nI created a service in Automator, it automatically saved it in ~/Library/Services/ but didn't appear in services menu as I expected. \nThe issue seems to be related to the file name of the workflow file (perhaps spaces in file name). In my experience, it should be enough to rename the file to solve the problem. \nTo do so, go to ~/Library/Services/ (from Finder menu: Go > Go to folder and paste ~/Library/Services/ there) and rename the service file, removing spaces from file name. \nThen you may need to go to Keyboard pane in Mac Preferences, and enable your service in the shortcut tab (look in the \"Services\" section). \n\nA: The renaming didn't help, and the \"no input\" as well. However the any application did the trick for me. I was sending the service strictly to Final Cut Pro, and for whatever reason it simply would not show up in the services menu. Changing it for any application solved the issue. The only problem is now the service is showing up everywhere, which is annoying. But it does't hurt, providing there is no shortcut conflict.\nEdit: I change it back to FCP and boom, everything working fine. I guess it had an internal conflict with the path to the app or something.\n", "Q: Why Gigabit Ethernet Direct Connect is not default at Macs? Trying to connect two Macintoshs with a Ethernet cable (capable of Gigabit speed, of course) will not automatically set a gigabit connection. Instead of this, a 100MB connection is established.

Thanks for any advice, answering or any way I should/could improve this question.\nBoth Macs tested are:\nBoth iMac (late 2011+), iMac + MacPro (Late 2009+)\nAll machines running Yosemite full updated.\n\nA: Gigabit Ethernet is new technology in wired networking so if you're using a crossover cable, it will only work up to 100Mbps. Use a straight cable instead.\nIn Wikipedia:\n\nAn Ethernet crossover cable is a type of Ethernet cable used to\n  connect computing devices together directly. It is most often used to\n  connect two devices of the same type: e.g. two computers (via network\n  interface controller) or two switches to each other. By contrast,\n  patch cables or straight through cables are used to connect devices of\n  different types, such as a computer to a network switch or hub.\nMany devices today support Auto MDI-X capability, wherein a patch\ncable can be used in place of a crossover cable, or vice versa, and\n  the receive and transmit signals are reconfigured automatically to\n  yield the expected result.\n\nTo make things easier to understand, network interface cards (NICs) back then were \"dumb\" so they still need separate lines for receive and transmit signals.

I've never seen an iOS device so coated with nicotine that it would be a problem since they don't have blowers / fans and need airflow to function properly, but I have faith that someone is capable of getting enough coating on anything to cover up any size gap large or small with enough effort. \nIt's really up to Apple whether they cover each repair based on how they train their service staff and common sense shows that most devices won't be affected enough by smoking to matter. It's not so much as voiding a warranty as the warranty is designed to cover defects in manufacturing and not problems caused by operating environments that are extreme or prolonged.\nIf your product were placed in a sealed plastic bag and you took it to a smoke free room and had a child sniff it - you probably wouldn't be denied service for something that wouldn't make someone recoil from the amount of nicotine and tar that permeated the air left in the bag after a few hours of being removed from the environment where it normally is stored and used. \n", "Q: How to mirror an application window in a second display? Is there any way to mirror an application window onto a second display?\nSpecific use case: I want to show a terminal window in a second screen (i.e. projector), while still working on that same window on my laptop display. Complete display mirror wouldn't work because I want to keep working with multiple apps opened but project only the terminal window.\n\nA: You can use an application like tmux within which you can run your first terminal session (on first display), and then open a different terminal window on the second display and use tmux attach-session to mirror the session that is already running on the first display. This should allow you to run and view commands from both the displays.\nNote that this technique is only useful for mirroring the terminal and no other GUI program.\n", "Q: Is there a way to permanently remove the iBooks app from a device? I am trying to remove the app completely as I do not want it as it takes up a third of my memory on my iPad. Is there any way of removing it altogether please??\n\nA: Unfortunately Apple does not allow you to remove the app completely, however if you go inside the app and delete all the books and PDF's the app should be less than 5mb.\n(Which even on a 16gb phone is negligible)\nTo delete all books/PDFs:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open iBooks\n\n*Make sure all books is selected in the top dropdown menu.\n\n*Click Select and select all books\n\n*Then delete\n\n\nThen go to Settings -> General -> Storage and iCloud Usage -> Storage: Manage storage -> Find iBooks and it should be <5mb\nIf you would like to hide the app completely iOS 9.3 has a new glitch that allows you to do this, video for that is HERE.\n", "Q: Folder-based photo management software for local use You'd think that there is more than enough photo management software out there. But for quite a while now, I have struggled to find Mac software suitable for my requirements. \nThe management software will be used on normal everyday pictures (holidays, landscapes and so on) as well as a large collection of documentary pictures with little artistic value from renovating protected old buildings. Working with those documentary pictures will require extensive tagging and search functions.\nI don't strictly require built-in editing and raw conversion functions.\nMy requirements list:\n\n\n*\n\n*Native Mac program (or at least very well ported interface from a different OS)\n\n*Pictures must be stored in a folder structure on disk, not a monolithic catalogue\n\n*This folder structure must follow changes made within the software, and any changes made in Finder must be tracked and represented in the photo manager\n\n*The manager must be able to write geotags, textual tags and timestamp corrections directly into the images (in order to make the metadata available to 3rd party apps -- sidecar files like those used by Darktable are useless there)\n\n*Geotags must be viewable on a map\n\n*Metadata and changes to the image catalogs must be easily syncable using classic, non-cloud tools like rsync, unison, Bittorrent Sync or SyncThing. \n\n\nBonus points for:\n\n\n*\n\n*support of other operating system\n\n*hierarchical tags\n\n*user-definable integration of external editing tools\n\n\nApart from KDE's really great DigiKam, which suffers from a not-yet-perfect Mac port, I did not find any software fulfilling those rather simple requirements. Perhaps someone here can point out what I missed.\nI evaluated the following programs:\n\n\n*\n\n*Digikam. Great. It's just heavily using the KDE ecosystem, which makes building the port on a Mac hard. It's also badly integrated in the OSX desktop.\n\n*Aperture. That's what I'm currently using. Syncing catalogues between machines using rsync is not trivial. Managed libraries don't properly follow changes done in Finder. Tagging is unnecessarily complicated.\n\n*Lyn. Small, lean, Mac only. Rather rudimentary. Doesn't fulfil requirement 4.\n\n*Darktable. See no. 4 above -- sidecar approaches are impractical for me, and \"darktable will never ever open source files for writing\".\n\n*Capture One. Fails on point 3, and the support told me that syncing between machines should only be done through manual import/export of sessions.\n\n*Media Pro. Same as above.\n\n*Unbound. Very rudimentary. No external tools configurable. Needs Dropbox as sync backend.\n\n*Pixa. Seems to be developed only very slowly, which does not make me feel good about its longevity. Doesn't really seem like photo management, but rather more like digital asset management. No geotagging.\n\n*Apple Photos / Google Photos. Cloud based. Too rudimentary.\n\n\nEdit: November 2019 additions\n\n\n*\n\n*Skylum Luminar 4. Represents the folder-based structure on disk perfectly in its DAM component. Offers flexible plugin management. Can not handle geotags at all, however, and lacks a proper EXIF/ITPC editor. \n\n\nSo far, those are my test results. Is there anything I'm missing / got wrong? Is there any software available that would fulfill my requirements?\n\nA: You basically have written the summary requirements for Photo Mechanic.\nIt's a folder based, workflow tool that is cross platform and highly optimized for managing images. Whatever changes it makes are stored in metadata in the images so you can edit them elsewhere as you please and it won't break import/export like library based workflows cannot do. \n\nA: Given Lyn is close to your needs, consider combining it with other applications. Such as:\n\n\n*\n\n*HoudahGeo offers a graphical interface for tagging and searching photos by location.\n\n*exiftool is a command line alternative from which you could craft any scripts or services you need.\n\n", "Q: NO LOGINS: System going down ... stuck and won't shutdown I issued a remote SSH shutdown command to a headless Mac server. However, the server is not shutting down and I can no longer access the server with SSH, I get this message:\n\nNO LOGINS: System going down at 08:16\n\nThis was nearly 20 minutes ago. What can I do now that the machine won't shut down and I cannot login?\nI realize I can push the power button, but I have some Drobos attached that could loose data if don't gracefully shut down.\n\nA: Go to Finder.

My battery is very weak in my iPhone 5, and I want stronger battery. I can buy double the size, around 2880mAh, but I want even stronger and I found one on eBay, battery for iPhone 5 with 3180mAh. Is it safe to install battery this durable into my iPhone 5? What would be the consequences, if any at all? Would be great if I could install this kind of battery and have no problems. Thanks for any advice guys!\n\nA: Theoretically, everything that is not official can be dangerous. You should make sure the hardware in question is not bad quality and has positive reviews. To be more sure reviews are written from users and not \"bots\", it would be better to buy on sites like Amazon.com , but you will never be 100% sure. BE CAREFUL!\n", "Q: iPod generation 4 won't upgrade ios Please help me, my iPod 4 won't upgrade past ios 6.1.6 and this is very annoying as there are many apps that you have to have at least ios 7 or 8 for. Does anyone know how I can upgrade?! Thanks!\n\nA: You can't update to iOS 9.  According to Apple, it's only compatible with iPod 5th & 6th generation.\nApple stops signing (authorizing) previous iOS versions shortly after the new ones come out.  Because of that, you can't update to iOS 7 or 8 because they're no longer available from Apple.\nYou might be able to bypass this restriction by jailbreaking your device but I don't recommend that because there's many things that can wrong, including bricking your iPod.\n", "Q: no imessage over mobile data My iPhone was not receiving imessages over  mobile data. Accidently my wifi was off for two days. When I switched wifi on after a couple of days, I received imessages which my colleagues sent 2 days earlier.

Apple used to sell its own, but now sells a Moshi Adaptor.\nAt my school, we use Belkin Adaptors sold  on Amazon (at this particular point in time) with a 66% discount price.\n", "Q: How can I simulate the process of marking a text (SMS or iMessage) as unread on my iPhone? As far as I know, there is no way to mark a text message as unread (if there is, please share!).\nI often receive text messages at inconvenient times, read them quickly, and then forget to reply to them when I'm free.  I'm looking for ways to simulate \"mark as unread\" (or \"remind me about this text message\") as easily as possible.\nThe best I have come up with it simply to not read the message in the messages app - then I can read the first sentence or so, get the gist of it, and I still have an unread notification on the app icon.  But this is not ideal of course.\nOne thing that's an obvious suggestion but is just too clunky is to add a todo-list item to respond (just like I'd add any other todo item).\n\nA: There's technically no way to mark a message as unread, but there's sort of a hacky workaround way to simulate it.\nHold down on the message you want to mark as unread and click \"copy\". Then start a new message, address it to yourself, paste in the message and send.\nSince there's a slight delay, you can back out of the conversation, and you will have 1 unread message from yourself.\n\n\nA: You can't, not in the standard iOS.  The only way to do this is to jailbreak and get a free app named 'Unread'.  It does what you want but you have to be ok with jailbreaking.\n", "Q: iBooks iCloud Storage Limit? I have enabled iCloud storage in iBooks on my Mac(s), iPad and iPhone. I have been slowly importing PDF and ePub books into iBooks on my macbook again so that I have a central location to store them(and can access from iPad, etc).\nWhenever I import though, iBooks gets about half way through processing the books I am importing and tells me that my iCloud storage is full. From that point on, it will tell me it is storing the books on the local device only.\nThe problem is, I have 200GB of iCloud space with only about 40GB used. 30GB or thereabouts would be books and the rest would be photos, backups, etc. i have checked from multiple devices and ensured my billing is ok(and it is, I definitely have 200GB space).\nSo my question is, does iBooks have a percentage limit of how much iCloud storage it can take up? Or maybe even a hard limit?\nFor context, I have tried system restarts, application restarts, different internet connections, etc. iBooks does not upload any additional books after the app is opened again unless I do another import, in which case it will get about 20-50% of the way through the files before it dies again.\n\nA: I had this same problem - books added on my Macbook Pro stopped showing up on my iPad. I solved it by deselecting iBooks in iCloud on my Mac (System Preferences/iCloud/ ... click on Options tab beside iCloud Drive ... scroll down the list and deselect iBooks.app. If iBooks is open, a message should pop up that you can share books over the cloud, and it gives you the option to do that. Select that option. By deselecting and re-selecting in this way the books I was trying to share over the cloud immediately appeared on my iPad.\n\nA: Apple menu/System Preferences/iCloud/iCloud Drive/... \"options\"... place a check mark in front of \"iBooks\"\n\nA: I deselect and select again the iBook option in iCloud Drive menu and the sync run normally\n\nA: The solution for me was to uncheck/recheck System Preferences/iCloud/iCloud Drive/Options/iBooks. Unchecking cleared out my entire iBooks library minus the newly added ePUB. Rechecking iBooks sync brought back all books and uploaded the newest one.\nThis had the unfortunate side effect of having all my redownloaded books being displayed out of order. For reference, my entire iCloud storage was around 180 GB out of 2 TB. My iBooks library is 6.6 GB with about 200 books being a mix of ePUB and PDF.\n", "Q: How to remove a partition that fails to remove. I failed installing Ubuntu, the remaining partitions are un-removeable, when ever I try and remove them I get operation failed. How can I resolve this issue? I need to either remove them or erase them.\n\nA: A pretty decent method to remove a partition is using a saw:\n\nIn the above example the repairman forgot to dismantle the disk properly and all partitions were lost.\nSmaller saws like a precision mechanical saw reduce the risk of cutting away your precious OS X partitions.\nSo to delete the partition you have to remove the hard disk from your Mac and disassemble it to expose the platters. Usually the disk color indicates the position and the type of the partitions:\n \nIn the example above the Ubuntu partition is the orange one, the Ubuntu swap partition is in lighter orange and just to illustrate an additional Windows volume (which I added before): it's the lighter blue one. The silver white part of the disk are the main OS X partition and the Recovery HD. To remove the Ubuntu partitions simply cut off both orange segments.\nOther known color codes are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Mixed orange/blue: Solaris\n\n*Red: Redhat\n\n*Light Green: Linux Mint\n\n*Colorful: older Windows versions\n\n\nAfter removing the Ubuntu partitions the disk will be slightly unbalanced. Visit your local tire repair shop to get it rebalanced similar to a car wheel.\n\nIf your internal disk is an SSD the approach is similar. The dyeing of the Flash-memory chips indicates the partition type. You don't need a precision saw though - a temperature-controlled soldering iron will be sufficient. To remove the Ubuntu partitions unsolder the orange chips. A rebalancing is not necessary because usually there are no rotating items in the SSD.\n", "Q: App Store reports updates but no updates are available It's one day that the AppStore icon and application of my iPhone 5S reports that there is one update to be done, but, in fact, no updates are available.\nI already tried to switch the iPhone off and on or reopen the app, but nothing changes.\n Why does this happened, and how can I fix it?\n\nA: Why not why can't they update it seems like this is a scam so that apple can get more money what do you think\n", "Q: Can I extend internal iPad storage? Running out of space to store photos on our iPad 2. Is it possible to plug in an external storage device, move photos to it, and then be able to access those photos as if they were stored internally?\n\nA: iPad internal storage is not extensible, but you can use services like iCloud Photos or Google Photos to store your pictures online and automatically download them as needed.\n\nA: Unfortunately, Apple only deploys iOS devices with internal proprietary SSD media only. Also, iPads are not modular, so you cannot change any of their components manually.\n\nA: As per the other two answers already here, Apple makes their iDevices with a fixed amount of non-modular proprietary flash storage, usually selectable upon purchase, and therefore the amount of storage inside cannot be changed.\nHowever, there are external storage products available in the market. Some products include (but will require you to download apps):\nSanDisk Wireless Connect\nSanDisk iXpand\nWD My Passport Wireless\nand many more are covered in this Macworld article.\nAdditionally, a quick search for \"external iOS storage\" on your favorite search engine might bring up something more suited to your needs.\n", "Q: Clean shutdown/restart from terminal in 10.7+ I have a headless system that is controlled remotely that I need to shutdown/restart in an automated way (without the use of VNC or local keyboard/mouse).\nUsing various commands via SSH or via my daemon work as expected and restart the machine:\nsudo shutdown -r now or osascript -e 'tell application \"System Events\" to restart'\nHowever these commands cause the OS to reopen windows of any running applications even though the following are all true:\n\n\n*\n\n*When logging out normally Reopen windows when logging back in is unchecked\n\n*Only the item I want to start with the login is listed in System Preferences > Users & Groups > Login Items.\n\n*defaults write -g ApplePersistence -bool no is set\n\n*System Preferences > General > Ask to keep changes when closing documents is checked or unchecked\n\n*System Preferences > General > Close windows when quitting an app is checked or unchecked\n\n*Recent Items is set to any value (has no effect)\n\n*~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow.plist contains TALLogoutSavesSate set to NO\nIn my case I can't actually use the applescript since 10.7+(?) warns when another machine is network shared with AFP or SMBed causing the shutdown to fail. The shutdown command forces the restart without popping up a dialog which is exactly what I need. However when the machine starts up I want exactly one application to start at login, and it is listed in Login items. \nThe machine is set to automatically log in so this application can run but if any other windows were open (Terminal or TextEdit with unsaved changes) want my shutdown/restart script to force close any open applications without saving and NOT open on next login. I also would rather not for-loop through all the user processes sending each a SIGTERM or SIGKILL manually before sending the shutdown command.\nI am fully aware this may cause data loss (if the user did not save their document) but this this is typically an unattended machine that I want a restart to take the machine to a known state, not the state it was left in.\nAFAICT none of these work to cleanly shutdown/restart the machine in 3.7+.\n\nA: While writing up this question I made a discovery that might help others to almost fully solve this issue:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow.plist contains TALLogoutSavesSate set to NO\n\nWhile this is true, there is another file located at ~/Library/Preferences/ByHost/com.apple.loginwindow.*.plist that contains an array called TALAppsToRelaunchAtLogin. That array contains a list of app windows currently open. \nDeleting this array, or in a more blunt way the whole file, and immediately restarting almost completely fixed the issue.\nThe remaining issue is when the machine starts up any open Finder windows are restored and if you had one or more terminal windows and actually ran the shutdown command from that window it causes it to be restored when Terminal is started again, but via SSH or a daemon seems to work fine.\nI don't really think this a suitable solution in the long run but so far in my little testing it does seem to work.\nupon further research it seems you can hook a script into login so it always deletes the file:\ndefaults write com.apple.loginwindow LoginHook /usr/bin/loginfix.sh\n:edit, along the same lines as the terminal window it looks like each individual app is saving it's state, so for example if you open TextEdit, make some changes and then restart the machine using the above method when the you log back in and start TextEdit you end up with the document you had open. Looking in ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.TextEdit explains everything\n", "Q: Choosing Restore Date in Carbon Copy Cloner Using CCC, how do I restore my El Capitan OS system to a date of several days ago.

The ones that Telegram generates are easily identified by being named with a series of 18 digits (e.g 532576936841446647.download), usually similar to one another, and always at zero-bytes length.\nYou can replicate the issue by trying some @gif searches after removing all files and seeing them being generated again.\nThey're safe to be removed; watch out not to remove the Safari ones, though, unless you'd like to restart your ongoing downloads.\n\nA: These .download files are basically download-in-progress files that have been created by Safari while performing a download. Once download is completed (so all the file blocks are retrieved) the extension is removed and the file becomes usable. Sometimes, these files remain as they are because downloads are interrupted by phenomena like power loss or just simply force quit of Safari while the download is being executed. Your case is pretty weird, but it's nothing you should worry about. A thing you could do is to clear the browser cache, so that Safari totally \"forgets\" about these downloads and stops attempting to create .download files.\n", "Q: Flagged emails keep returning and won't synchronize between Apple Mail and Gmail I've had this problem before and can't recall how I managed to fix it last time. I use Apple Mail to access my Gmail and normally flagged emails show up correctly. Starred emails in Gmail equate to flagged emails in Apple Mail and I can unflag an email in either Gmail or Apple Mail and it works.\nBut now I've got four emails that I can't unflag. They're not flagged in Gmail at all (although they used to be). When I see them in the Flagged folder in Apple Mail, they don't even have flag icons next to them but they're still counted in the number showing next to \"Flagged\". If I manually re-flag them and then unflag them, they disappear from the Flagged box. But then if I click into Inbox and then back into Flagged they show up again.\nAny ideas about how to make these guys disappear for good?!\n\nA: Here's one approach I found that appeared to work:\n\n\n*\n\n*For each flagged email that won't sync\n\n\n*\n\n*Mark it as \"red\" flagged in the Flagged folder (it should show in the Flagged folder even though it doesn't have a flag next to it)\n\n*A red flag appears next to the message\n\n*Clear the flag on the message\n\n*The number of messages in the Flagged box should be reduced by one\n\n*Fully quit Apple Mail (Cmd-Q)\n\n*Restart Apple Mail and the flagged message should remain unflagged\n\n\n\nNote: you can select all the emails in the \"flagged\" folder at once and do this en masse.\nAs user @ohcibi confirmed, you must force quit Apple Mail for this to work.\nFollowup: I just ran into this issue again and this process didn't solve it. I believe it may be related to the \"Important\" tag that Gmail adds. I went into Gmail and unmarked the message as being \"Important\", and then followed this process. That fixed the problem.\n\nA: @aardvark's approach didn't work for me.  However, a slightly modified version of it did work:\n\n\n*\n\n*Flag all emails that are in the Flagged folder but seemingly aren't flagged.\n\n*Quit Mail using Cmd-Q.\n\n*Re-open Mail, those emails should still be in the Flagged folder, but will now have the flag.\n\n*Unflag them and Cmd-Q a second time.\n\n*On reload, they should be correctly removed from the Flagged folder.\n\n\nA: I frequently had this issue, a real working solution is to fully Quit mail (cmd+Q) and opening again while holding alt by clicking once the Mail icon.\n\nA: Simply delete the e-mail entirely, then move it from the trash back to a folder (or the inbox). There should be no more flag.\n\nA: I've tried all of these, to no avail. The only option was to go nuclear by deleting the offending Gmail account from Apple Mail accounts and reinstalling it. It took a few hours to reinstall all 60,000 email messages, but once it did I didn't have any more trouble with flagged messages. \n", "Q: Convert document to PDF from right-click context menu Sometimes I have doc and txt files that I need to convert to PDF. It'd be great if I didn't have to open an application to convert the item to PDF.

You can simply to convert any .doc to .pdf over the internet, on several websites.\n", "Q: Can we run OS X apps inside X11 (XQuartz)? I'm wondering if that is possible, so that I can use some X11 window manager for everything.\n\nA: No. Native OS X apps don't call down to X11 protocol and no one (Apple or other) has implemented any sort of shim/translation layer/conversion tool to port over the API.\nIt would surely involve slowdown, reduced acceleration, possibly loss of fidelity and loss of functionality.\n\nA: You could have an alternate login to X11, but use a non- Apple X11 VNC client to call Apple screen sharing.\n", "Q: iPhone Wi-Fi disconnecting when I watch YouTube I have an iPhone 4S which works perfectly fine in all aspects… except one. Whenever I'm watching a video on YouTube, especially one with movement (not so much on videos that show one background with a song playing), the Wi-Fi connection completely cuts out. I have to manually go to settings and reconnect. This can happen multiple times per video. I've watched videos on other sites and they didn't appear to have this problem, although it's worth noting that none of them use the same player as YouTube. This has happened ever since I got the phone and has really been annoying me. How do I stop this?\nAdditional information: I always run the most recent update to IOS, so I'm currently on 9.3. \n\nA: Try to troubleshoot, it sounds like you have some problems, which are not related to the application itself.\nSome ideas to check:\n\n\n*\n\n*check the WiFi signal, how many bars do you see in the place where you normally watch it, it could be you covering the signal with someting (phone stand, hands, walls, furniture, etc), and signal goes weaker, until totally lost;\n\n*try to connect to another WiFi access point, with the same video application or even the same video clip, and check if you experiencing the same issues;\n\n*check the settings on your WiFi router (or data plan limitations with your provider), may be it has some bandwidth limitation, and when you watch videos which are heavy on traffic - it just cuts the bandwidth, or something;\n\n*connect another phone of your friend, preferably with the same phone model to the same WiFi access point, to understand if the issue is connected to specific phone, or to specific access point.\n\n*try to reboot WiFI router, and the Iphone, to see if this will help as well, it could be some temporary hardware/software glitch.\n\n*if your WiFi router has several WiFi bandwidths: 5GHz and standard - try switching to one mode, without 5GHz, sometimes it helps, as phone is shifting between them and might loose the connection.\n\n\nHope this helps you to troubleshoot!\n", "Q: How to Install PIL in El Capitan with Pip?

The USB 3.0 specification requires\n  USB 3.0 data to be scrambled and it requires spread-spectrum. The\n  noise from USB 3.0 data spectrum can be high (in the 2.4-2.5GHz\n  range). This noise can radiate from the USB 3.0 connector on a device\n  (such as a PC or Router), the USB 3.0 connector on the peripheral\n  device or the USB 3.0 [port]. If the antenna of a wireless device\n  operating in this band is placed close to any of the USB 3.0 radiation\n  channels, it can pick up the broadband noise. The broadband noise\n  emitted from a USB 3.0 device can affect the SNR (signal-to-noise\n  ratio) and limit the sensitivity of any wireless receiver whose\n  antenna is physically located close to the USB 3.0 device. This may\n  result in a drop in throughput on the wireless link.\n\n\nA: I moved my drive as far from my mac as the cord would reach and the problem was solved, my wifi still works. I had stored the drive under the vertically held MacBook.\n\nA: I've had the same problem on my Macbook Pro Retina 2017 when connecting an external hard drive through a dongle.\nThat Mac has two thunderbolt ports, one very close to the other. I've managed to solve the issue by unplugging my dongle from the port closest to display and plugging it into a port that's a bit farther from display.\nI've read here that the reason for this problem may be that HDD is stealing power from WiFi when hardware is too close to each other, or something like that. Anyway, plugging it into another port solved the issue for me.\nUPDATE:\nIt seems like the solution was a one-time. If that doesn't work, try plugging your laptop into power. Maybe even moving an extern disk as far away as possible from mac. Plugging into power solved it for me this time.\n\nA: I have experienced this problem and it take my hours. Now, everything is OK.\n\n", "Q: Sim free vs Verizon iphone I'm looking at the new iPhone SE and was wondering if you're going to pay in full for the phone ($499) is the sim free phone different than the Verizon carrier specific one? I read somewhere the sim free had 1 extra band (so maybe that is better if you want the flexibility to change carriers later)?  Verizon is my current carrier, and I'll start the phone there but could see moving somewhere later if the deals are worthwhile. Once I put a Verizon sim (which the Apple Store will give you for free) in the sim free one, is it the same as the Verizon specific one (and conversely if I get the Verizon specific phone and take out the sim for another can it go to any GSM network)?\n\nA: The only difference is cost.\nNow that we've moved into a contract-free phone era, service providers, like Verizon, will offer to let you make a payment plan instead of paying for the phone upfront. In the end, the cost is the same as the SIM-Free version, but the Verizon version only works on Verizon until they unlock it.\nConclusion: Verizon iPhones are physically the same as SIM-Free iPhones, but Verizon has more control over the Verizon model.\n\nBonus note:\nIf you are considering getting an iPhone and are on AT&T or T-Mobile, the SIM-Free version will be a better deal because only the SIM-Free, Verizon, and Sprint models support CDMA, which is needed for those networks.\n", "Q: Offline installation of El Capitan from a Windows machine? My macbook pro OS X is broken behind repair and I need to re-install the OS X. Unfortunately it seems the online installation is not working, because it stops downloading about half way through and never completes.\nIn any case, I only have access to Windows machines. Is there any way to create a USB bootable drive to install El Capitan on my macbook pro 13' (late 2014)? \nAny other way to do an offline installation?\n\nA: If there is an Apple Store near you, you can go in and they will allow you to download the installer.\n\nYou may also be able to find someone who can create the installer for you.\n", "Q: VLC 2.2.2 and OS X El Capitan Issue I have been using VLC Player for 7 years and after update to 2.2.2 It is really painful to use it with El Capitan.\nIt is very slow to forward or backward, It constantly freezes and lots of time the display gone, color changes in display. It happens with the same mkv files which I used to watch without any problem 1 month ago before 2.2.2. \nIs there a solution for this?\n\nA: I run into similar issues with VLC and it's not limited to OS X.  Fortunately you have a couple of options...\nRoll back VLC\nUninstall VLC completely and install an \"archived\" version.  Go to ftp://ftp.videolan.org/pub/videolan/vlc/ and select the version you want to download.  If you need a good reliable app to cleanly remove applications, check out AppCleaner\nWhen you find the version you want, navigate into the macosx directory (I am using the 2.1.1 directory for this example)\n\nGet something else\nHave a look at Elmedia Player.  It's free on the Apple App Store.  I personally went this route because I started \"falling out of like\" with VLC.  There's a bunch of features on it that just don't work and I needed to go with other solutions.\n", "Q: Recording both sound and video on my screen via my Macbook Pro? So I learned that on the Macbook Pro, the default Quicktime Pro has the ability to record video from your computer screen. This is great, but it doesn't have the ability to record sound unless it's from the actual mic picking up sound from the speakers literally playing the sound.\nIs there a way to get it to record sound regardless of what my hardware volume settings are at (in particular, even if I have muted the sound)? As in, record sound + video even after I've pressed F10 to mute.\n\nA: What you are looking for is LoopBack.\n", "Q: How do I change the mouse's i-beam cursor in Xcode 7.3 There was a similar question to this on Stack Overflow regarding Xcode 5, however, the solution no longer works.\nI would like to change my IBeam cursor in Xcode to use this cursor instead.\nQuestion\nHow do I change my mouses Ibeam cursor in Xcode 7.3\n\nA: Here's the solution that works for me thanks to a GitHub link provided by @aldryd:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://github.com/egold/better-xcode-ibeam-cursor/issues/16\nGitHub user sokobania provides the following steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download ThemeEngine from: https://github.com/alexzielenski/ThemeEngine\n\n*Run ThemeEngine in Xcode and you may be presented with a few errors.\n\n\n*\n\n*Failed to code sign \"ThemeEngine\".  \n\n\n*\n\n*Just click Fix Issue\n\n\n*Nullability specifier '_Nonnull' cannot be applied to non-pointer type 'NSString'; did you mean to apply the specifier to the pointer?\n\n\n*\n\n*Allow Xcode to Resolve\n\n\n\n*We'll need to remove some derived data from Embedded Binaries. Click your root application > Targets > General > Embedded Binaries and remove the top item:\n\n\n*Run ThemeEngine and select \"Open Document\", you'll need to locate your Assets.car file in Xcode here:\n/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/SharedFrameworks/DVTKit.framework/Versions/A/R‌​esources/Assets.car\n\n\n*Once loaded, find DVTIbeamCursor in the list and drag your IBeam of choice over Xcode's default Ibeam.\n\nI like use the Ibeam provided by @TheTC: \ndracoventions.com/images/external/TIbeam.tiff\n\n*Select \"Save As...\" and overwrite Xcode's Assets.car file with the new file. I had to save the copy to my desktop and then drag the new Assets.car file into the Xcode folder to overwrite.  \n\nA: Here's egold's ibeam solution updated for Xcode 7.3...\nhttps://github.com/ebaker355/better-xcode-ibeam-cursor\nWorked beautifully for me.\n", "Q: Apple Watch face blank I mistakenly unpaired my Apple Watch from my iPhone. Now the voice over on my watch is on, screen curtain is on, but my screen is blank. I don't know which button to press and I have been trying to pair it back. Since my screen is blank, how do I do this?\n\nA: Try restarting it by holding down the Digital Crown and side button together until you see the Apple logo appear. When that doesn’t work, set it on charge for 15 minutes and repeat. After an hour and no life, you might need a hardware repair or service technician to diagnose it from the service port. \n", "Q: Removing a news source from iOS Spotlight Search I like the headlines from Spotlight Search, but I hate that fact it displays many sites that have paywalls (e.g., LA Times, NY Times, etc).  Is there a way to tell iOS not to show certain sites in the headlines?\n\nA: Unfortunately, no. Apple doesn't give us a way to adjust the news sources for spotlight search. There's rumors that it takes your preferences into consideration when you read and swipe-away articles in the News app, but I haven't seen that happen yet with my preferences. \n", "Q: App will not open and will crash on every attempt Whenever I open an app it goes there for a second then crashes and goes directly to the home screen. This haven't happened before, it recently started.\nI have restarted my phone, powered it off, and updated to the latest iOS.\nIs there anything I can do to fix this other than reinstalling the application?\n\nA: No, the app is either corrupted (which happens sometimes during the download) or as a serious defect that causes it to crash (and that Apple didn't catch during review).\nYou'll have to uninstall then reinstall the app. \n", "Q: Local Forwarding does not work I have tried to forward local ports over SSH to a remote host:\n$ cat .ssh/config\nhost km4ayu.com\nLocalForward 29070

From manual page for ssh_config:\n\nGatewayPorts\nSpecifies whether remote hosts are allowed to connect to local forwarded ports.  By default, ssh(1) binds local port forwardings to the loopback address.  This prevents other remote hosts from connecting to forwarded ports.  GatewayPorts can be used to specify that ssh should bind local port forwardings to the wildcard address, thus allowing remote hosts to connect to forwarded ports.\nThe argument must be “yes” or “no”.  The default is “no”.\n\nYou need to put also\nGatewayPorts yes\n\nto your ssh_config, and specify the local address explicitly:\nLocalForward 192.168.1.116:29070 127.0.0.1:29070\n\n", "Q: Why does `whoami` give a different answer than Current User in Users & Groups? I don't recall exactly what info I was asked to provide at the time I set the mac up, which is leading to some confusion.\nOn my mac, when I run whoami in a terminal, it tells me aerovistae, my general username. However, if I open Users & Groups, it tells me the current user is myFirstName myLastName.\nWhy is this? Is it the same account, and it has two different name properties? What is the difference?\n\nA: It is the same account. The name displayed in Users & Groups is your full name, the one shown by whomami is the name of the account as known to the underlying Unix system (and also used as the folder name for your home folder). To check yourself, open Users & Groups, unlock if necessary and then right-click on your user name in the left column. This will show you the technical details behind your account.\n\n", "Q: Unable to clear Xcode from Trash. Force clear in Terminal returns permission error? Since the App Store seemed stuck with updating Xcode to 7.3, I have decided to delete it and reinstall. However, after moving Xcode to the Trash, it refused to be cleared and instead be stuck on the \"Preparing to empty the trash...\" window.\nSo, I've decided to force empty the trash in Terminal by rm -rf ~/.Trash/*, only to get an endless loop of error message saying this:\nrm: /Users/jordanchanph/.Trash/Xcode.app/Contents/.../IOCatalogue/reset.xml: Permission denied\n\nHow can I empty the trash?\n\nA: sudo rm -rf ~/.Trash/*\n\nis your friend.\nI would think cause of the errors are permissions, perhaps Xcode sets files with permissions exclusive to root (superuser).\nWhat sudo does is run the following command (rm -rf ~/.Trash/*) with root privileges - think of it as \"when in doubt with permission denied, sudo\". Of course, the permission denied error is not to be ignored as it could be a sign of permissions errors. But, if you know what you are doing, sudo solves your problems. (this sums it up nicely)\n\nA: Make sure of the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*No Apple devices (iOS, iPad, ...) are connected to your computer (MacOS Catalina or later)\n\n*iTunes is not open or running (MacOS High Sierra or earlier)\n\n\nThey hog some resources XCode uses and therefore prevent it from being deleted.\n\nA: I ran (rm -rf ~/.Trash/*) on my MacBook Pro (mid 2012) running 10.13.6 and it hung.\nI opened up Trash, right-clicked on XCode and opened up Package Contents, then clicked \"delete immediately\" while the 'rm' command was still running.\nI saw \"deleting 0 items\".  I terminated the 'rm' command and 'x'd out of the \"deleting 0 items\" window.\nNow comes the strange part.  I clicked on the name of one of the components, intending to edit it (that has worked for me in the past).  Instead of taking my edit, it the editing highlight disappeared, and then the component itself went away.\nI did this successively for the other components, and after the last one, XCode itself vanished from the Trash folder.\nI don't have an explanation, but I suppose the point is that this technique worked. \n\nA: I found that going into the Package Contents and Moving the contents folder to the trash, then opening that up, and deleting each individual folder by itself works. There are some files that won't delete for some reason. If it doesn't delete, then open that folder up and delete those files individually. Etc. etc. It worked and only took a few minutes.\n", "Q: Restart with the same windows and programs open I have an iMac iOS 10.11.4.

I cant see nothing but white shattered circles. I was wondering if I repaired it will all my pictures in the gallery will still be there?\n\nA: Why don't you connect the iPad to a computer and back up the contents before the repair? Also, cracked glass and physical damage rarely causes connector problems or prevents a sync with iTunes from completing. You'd only have to repair the screen if the digitizer didn't work enough to tap one time to accept a pairing request if needed.\nThere's no guarantee that delaying the backup will help and there's a chance that the damage could cause a failure of the logic parts or storage parts - especially when a repair tech starts working on the screen.\nApple will help you locate backups before they accept the iPad for service, so I would start there and see if your gallery is already on iCloud or in a backup.\n", "Q: can't rename HD My son's mac running 10.11 has the hard drive named this\ncurie HD\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\ncopying and pasting reveals lots of spaces after the sequence of \" characters.\nI can't rename the HD in Finder.

I tracked this down to the fact Emacs.app was trying to run /usr/bin/login, the default for the \"Terminal\" app. \nI can switch \"Terminal\" to run /bin/bash, but that doesn't solve the Emacs.app problem or similar problems for any other apps that try to run /usr/bin/login.\nIt looks like I need to fix /usr/bin/login to run /usr/bin/false and not /bin/false, but I have no idea how.\nI tried to trick the programs backwards,\nsudo ln -s /usr/bin/false /bin/false \n\nand I get \"Operation not permitted.\"  I tried\nsudo cp /usr/bin/false /bin/false\n\nand I get \"Operation mot permitted.\"\nI'm stuck looking for \"the right answer\" or for other work arounds.\n\nA: I had the same problem, with emacs giving me \"Error (use-package): exec-path-from-shell :init: Searching for program: no such file or directory, /bin/false\" on startup.\nHowever, I noticed that this only happens when running Emacs (installed from emacsformacosx) from the Dock or Spotlight. If I ran it from my Terminal, or by clicking on it in Applications in finder, it worked fine. \nAfter a restart, the problem was resolved. I suspect that Dock and Spotlight held on to my original default shell, and after a restart, they used the new value (changed from /bin/false to /bin/zsh).\n\nA: Your emacs shell is incorrectly being directed to /bin/false, which is just a binary that immediately exits, returning false when it's called.

I assume this is some CAD or floor plan tool available for the new iPad. When I checked on the experience page, it didn't show any CAD tool that was specifically used for architectural drawings. \nThe best I can guess, it may be AutoCAD 360, something from Morpholio, or uMake. None of those look exactly like the demo so I'm a bit stumped.\nDoes anyone know for certain what app that was in the video?\n\nA: I think the app you're referring to is BIMx, our building information viewer app that lets you interact with and explore architectural CAD drawing files on iOS.\n", "Q: Mac OS X Terminal mouse reporting I don't know why this is bothering me but I've been pressing Cmd-R to refresh my browser and today I mistakenly pressed this combination while using the terminal.\nI came across an option known as \"Mouse Reporting\". What is it? Is it on by default in OS X? How do I reset the terminal to defaults (including mouse reporting)?\n\nA: To my knowledge it is turned off by default. However, all it allows is for applications run in the Terminal to see the position of your mouse cursor. This could be useful for things like games where you use your mouse. So in most cases, it simply does not matter.\nTo turn off Mouse Reporting, just press Cmd-R again.\nHowever, if you really want to reset your Terminal preferences: \n\n\n*\n\n*First quit the Terminal, then open the Finder.\n\n*Press Cmd-Shift-G and type ~/Library into the bar that appears\n\n*Press go.\n\n*Find the Preferences folder, then find the file called com.apple.Terminal.plist.\n\n*Drag it into the trash, then empty the trash.\n\n\nYour terminal should be back to factory settings.\n", "Q: How to rename video `title`? When exporting a video from iMovie it asks for a title. Upon saving the file you'll find it has named the file whatever you input for the title. Now if you rename that file in Finder then open it in QuickTime and show the Movie Inspector, you'll find that the video title is the old title - the title you input in iMovie. Unfortunately you can't edit the title here. It doesn't show the title in Finder's Get Info. So my question is how can you edit the video's title (not filename) without reexporting the movie from iMovie?\n\n\nA: If you are running Mac OS X and find that some of your video files have metadata included, then it will have been set in Apple's iTunes. In iTunes you can add, edit or remove all metadata from video files. This is only applicable to certain video types, however, as they must be iTunes recognized filetypes. The file types supported by iTunes are the same as those supported by QuickTime, and so if you have QuickTime plugins installed, you will be able to utilize those as well.\nOpen iTunes on your Mac.\nClick \"Movies\" or \"TV Episodes\" on the left.\nSelect the video you want to edit, right-click it and click \"Get Info.\"\nClick \"Video.\" Highlight each field of data and press \"Delete.\" Click \"Info\" and edit.\nOr use free tool MetaZ ( http://griff.github.io/metaz/ )\n", "Q: iTunes audio cuts out at random times when listening to music This has been an ongoing problem for over a year now. When listening to music in iTunes, something is causing the audio to cut out for a second or two at seemingly random moments. I never stream music. All the music I listen to is stored locally on my machine. I've had the same machine for several years now and it didn't always do this. It used to play music perfectly no matter how many programs I had open or how many labor intensive tasks I was performing. In fact I can recall instances where I was doing some video editing which slowed the machine to a crawl. And even with the spinning wheel of death and everything being frozen, even then, if I were listening to music, it never missed a beat. But now it seems like the least little network activity or the least little bump in cpu usage causes not only iTunes but also audio through VLC Player to cut out.

Once I delete the photos in the photostream there are no duplicates anymore.\nI'm using most recent versions of OS X, iOS, Photos.app, Photostream activated, iCloud photo Library NOT activated on all devices.\nIs there any solution to get rid of the duplicates without deleting them in the Photostream? Doesn't iOS notice? The solution I would prefer is using photostream only \"one-way\" from iPhone to my Mac. I remember an option in the good old iPhoto.app making this possible, which is not present any more in the new Photos.app, as far as I know. By \"one-way\" I mean that only new photos I take on my iPhone are uploaded to the Photostream, but not photos I add to the Photos.app on my Mac.

I'm not sure what to do and the Apple documentation, even the Quick Start Guide, is overwhelming and confusing for me.\nSome developers say \"Just wait until it expires, Xcode will then offer to fix it.\", others like Jared Sinclair adamantly oppose doing that. I'd do what he suggests, but I'm not sure how and would likely mess up stuff.\nIs there a truly user friendly guide on how to handle iOS Certificates and Provisioning Profiles?\n\nA: It's hard to know what specific step you're stumped on - since an error signing development builds will cascade and cause issues when you upload. Uploading can have new issues if you don't have problems running development builds.\nThe outline I use is:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://developer.apple.com/support/code-signing/\nIt breaks down the steps to code signing which also deals with profiles.

We can get into recovery mode and we can go on the guest user, but not on the main user. Whenever you log in to the main user, it just shuts down.\nSince I have a fair knowledge of Ubuntu, I thought I could just back up her files through a live USB (not store them on the live USB, but on an external hard drive) and reinstall OS X. I booted into the live USB, and there was no mounted hard drive, which was odd. I checked it, and figured it was encrypted, so I went on and installed libfvde on the live usb to see if I could hack the encrypted system open (had tried all kinds of other things before this), but I just could not do it.\nSo, what I want to do now is find out what is wrong, figure out if it can be fixed, and if not, back up the files and reinstall the OS.

Disk Utility should be able to repair that.\nYou will know if Disk Utility finds an error (one that is listed in red under the Details arrow) and announces it has fixed it.\nIf disk utility does not repair the problem, the computer will need be taken to Apple or be looked at by a Mac Specialist or qualified consultant.

How can I retrieve all my contacts from iCloud back up to my iPhone?\n\nA: To recover data from an iCloud backup you need to restore the whole backup onto an iPhone. All data currently stored on the phone will be lost as part of the process. \nAs you are already using iCloud, you might also find your contacts by directly logging in on icloud.com with your Apple ID. This of course will only work if you've configured your phone to sync with iCloud. \n", "Q: Unhide application from switcher and menu bar Recently one of apps is not showing in the Application Switcher, the Dock or even in the menu bar. The only way that I have found to get to it is via Mission Control or Launch Pad. And even when I do this it still does not show up in the menu bar so I can't access the menu items (preferences etc.) The application in question is Fantastical 2 (an alternative Calendar app).\n\nA: User error ... I had to use the command+comma shortcut to change preferences.

Note: Don't type rm or any variation of it into terminal under any circumstances if you are not experienced with the command line\nDoes the Mac OS X block you from using rm in those directories to delete a user or delete all the users and do you need to use sudo and put in an administrator password or does it let you without any passwords? \nFor example if you typed in the following line into terminal would it just completely wipe everything?\ncd /Users; echo rm -rf *\n\nOf course the echo wouldn't be used if you actually wanted the remove command to run.\n\nA: Two cases:\n\n\n*\n\n*you're logged in as root. Everything goes away.\n\n*you're logged in as a normal user.  All of that user's files go away.\n\n\nIn some systems, rm is supposed to prompt you if you do this at the \"/\" level.

App preferences usually stored in user's folder and probably in the registry.\nHow do apps get installed on OS X? Do they just go into /Applications directory? Where are the preferences stored? And how using a package manager such as homebrew is different from simply dragging an app to /Applications?\n\nA: Installing Apps\nThere are several ways to install applications on OS X.\n\n*\n\n*The App Store: Another way to install applications is from the App Store. Apps from the App Store are first downloaded as a .dmg to a system directory, and then installed to the /Applications/ directory.\nApps downloaded from the App Store are sandboxed, which means that they can only read from and write to specific folders. They're also managed a bit better when it comes to the installation and uninstall process.\n\n\n*From the Web/Drag-and-Drop: OS X applications are sometimes distributed as standalone folders with a .app extension or inside of an installer with a .pkg extension. Sometime programs are distributed on a .dmg, which is a disk image containing the .app and perhaps a Readme. Apps downloaded outside of the App Store might not run unless you secondary-click on them to run, and then grant permission. This is a security feature. (It's similar in appearance to the Windows UAC, but it works differently.)\nApplications are typically installed into /Applications/ but each user can have their own applications directory inside of their home folder, located at /Users/{user}/Applications/, or ~/Applications/ for short. Apps placed into the personal ~/Applications directory will show up in Launchpad and Spotlight searches.\n\n\n*Package Managers/The Command Line: It's fairly common (especially for developers) to install apps via the command line with homebrew, macports, or even as Ruby gems. These sometimes land in other directories, such as /usr/local/bin/ If you're not sure where a package manager is putting your files, that information is readily available on the internet.\nUser Data\nThe closest thing you have to the windows registry on OS X is the notion of a \"property list.\" Property lists are small files saved by each application, and unlike the windows registry, they aren't centralized.  Property list files end in a .plist extension. (Interestingly enough, unlike Windows, file extensions don't define what a file is on OS X as much as they do on Windows. Finder does rely extensions for information on how to display a file, but the file meta-data is treated with more significance on OS X than on Windows.)\nSometimes they're saved in  /Users/{user}/Library/Preferences/, but they can be saved in a  variety of places, depending on the app and the kind of information being stored. For example, Safari stores your pinned tabs and last session in ~/Library/Safari/LastSession.plist\nUninstalling Apps\nI had questions about uninstalling apps when I got my first Mac. The simplest answer is that you can just delete the .app bundle from the /Applications/ directory. As noted above, there may be some plist files left behind.\nOn older version of OS X, there were third-party uninstaller apps that tried to clean up for you. They are still available, but I don't know how well they work, because newer versions of OS X are stricter about security. (You can try AppZapper if you'd like.)\nApple has a knowledge base article that covers installing and deleting apps from outside the App Store.\n\nA: If the file ends in .app drag it into the applications folder. If the file ends .pkg double click it to run the intaller.\nPreferences are normally stored in /Users/username/Library/Preferences or /Users/username/Library/Application Support.\nHomebrew is used to install command line applications. There is a plugin (homebrew cask) that lets you install gui applications. If you are not good with the command line don't use homebrew.\n", "Q: Does \"Masters\" folder in Photos package contain everything? Theres a folder called /Masters in the Mac Photos App, when you \"Show Package Contents\". I was wondering if this contained all Photos and Video including Hidden content.\nOne recommended way I've seen to Merge two Photos Libraries is to take master from one and drag it into the Photos app. I just want to make sure this is correct before I delete the \"merged\" Photos Library.\n\nA: Yes it does, however Photos will have to regenerate all the thumbnails etc.\nIf you are trying to merge to photos libraries why not open the library you want to merge select all Command+A and then file Export\nThen drag them into the new library, this way there is no risk of corrupting anything.\n", "Q: Scroll Lock Button on MacBook I cannot use my touchpad to scroll on my macbook.

I've researched this, but can't find the exact answer I'm looking for. My wife has an iPhone 6s and has taken many pictures that are apparently \"Live Photos\". I tried importing her pictures in to Windows for her to use, but some have the .mov extension, while others are in the traditional .jpg form. She really wants the pictures as full resolution pictures, but I am having trouble getting them for her. Is there a way to batch export all of the pictures she wants into full resolution photos? She has hundreds of them, so doing one at a time would take forever. I tried importing them with a Google program called \"Picasa\" but most of them are .mov files.\nAny help would be appreciated. She is worried she'll have to live with the short movie files.\n\nA: There should be a matching JPEG for every MOV file, which contains the full resolution photo. \n\nA: You may want to try Google Photos instead of Picasa, which Google no longer supports.\nI personally have not tried this, as I do not have access to a iPhone 6s, but a friend has tried this out for me and says it works. YMMV.\n\nA: You can use https://www.copytrans.net/copytransphoto/. It should allow you to transfer only the JPEG.\n", "Q: Command-+ style zooming in iOS Safari I'd like to be able to zoom in on a web page in iOS Safari the way you can in the Mac OS version using Command-+. Note that this is different than pinch/spread zooming in iOS. If I spread my fingers to zoom a page, everything is magnified but the browser window just gets wider so you can no longer see the whole thing, making side to side panning necessary. On a well-designed web page, if I use Command-+ to zoom in, everything gets larger but the margins don't change. The text gets bigger and re-flows so that it still fits in the same margins. Is there a way to do that in Safari on iOS?\n\nA: Unfortunately this isn't possible with native iOS controls. A work around is a Javascript bookmarklet. First, bookmark any page and then bookmark another page. Then, choose bookmarks and edit them. For the first one, rename it the minus (-) symbol and change the URL to:\njavascript:var p=document.getElementsByTagName('*');for(i=0;i<p.length;i++){if(p[i].style.fontSize){var s=parseInt(p[i].style.fontSize.replace(\"px\",\"\"));}else{var s=12;}s-=2;p[i].style.fontSize=s+\"px\"}\nDo the same for the other bookmark, but rename it the plus symbol (+) and change the URL to:\njavascript:var p=document.getElementsByTagName('*');for(i=0;i<p.length;i++){if(p[i].style.fontSize){var s=parseInt(p[i].style.fontSize.replace(\"px\",\"\"));}else{var s=12;}s+=2;p[i].style.fontSize=s+\"px\"}\nNow to increase or decrease the size of text, simply tap the bookmarks.\n", "Q: Disable Upgrade to El Capitan I have Maverick and the option to Upgrade to OS X El Capitan pops up.\nI don't want to do this.

I wipe and reinstall OS X about once ever few months—probably more than necessary if I'm honest with myself, but then, it has become my go-to way to fix problems, and I've become very fast at getting everything set up again.\nThere is however one thing I have to do after every reinstall that takes quite some time on my slow internet connection: re-downloading the \"enhanced quality\" version of the \"Samantha\" system voice (my personal favorite).\nIs there any way I could back up this enhanced voice so that I won't have to re-download it every time I install OS X? Ideally, I'd like a simple .pkg file I can just double click to install. Such a .pkg file for \"Enhanced Speech Recognition\" can be downloaded here, but I can't find anything similar for system voices.\n\nA: Search for CatalogVersion 2 ApplePostURL http://swpost.apple.com in a browser.

My phone is currently trapped under a collapsed building. It is showing up on find my iPhone so it's still alive! I ordered a new phone as I don't know when or if they can recover it. If I activate the new phone with my old number, will I lose the ability to track my old phone? I'd like to keep watching it to see if it continues to survive.\n\nA: If you transfer the number to a new cellular data plan, and the phone is not connected to a wifi hotspot, your phone won't be able to report current GPS coordinates to Apple's Find My Phone servers. In short, I think the answer is no, but as @HLLB pointed out, your phone's battery will probably die before the phone number port is completed, so better get to digging!\n\nA: I do not know about iPhone tracking, but about mobile networks.\nThe phone number (MSISDN) does not belong to or reside on the phone. The number is on a database (HLR) in the mobile network where is is related to the SIM (IMSI). You can remove SIM from phone and transfer it to another phone.\nThe network operator can change issue a new SIM and transfer the number to this SIM so you have a seamless changeover.\nI doubt this would affect Apple's identification of the phone which would be related to its identification number (IMEI).\n", "Q: Safari playing a youtube video in the background I start Safari, and after a few seconds, I hear what seems to be the sound from a video.

Closing tabs, clearing cache, clearing history all have no effect. The sound only stops when I exit Safari. When I start Safari again, the sound starts again from the beginning.\nWhat is going on? How can Safari play a video if no tab/window is showing a video/video site?\nEdit: And how do I make it stop?\n\nA: You might want to try this solution from Apple's own forum (be sure to back-up your Bookmarks first):\n\nOpen a Finder window.

Under the hood this is using file Metadata library. This is accessible via the command line through the \"md* utilities like mdfind, mdls etc. If you're going to be running this command frequently you might want have it available to easily paste in a terminal instead of pointing and clicking in the Finder and this would be a expeditious way to return them.\nmdfind 'kMDItemContentModificationDate >= $time.now(-300)' will show you all the files that were modified in the last 5 minutes (300 seconds) on the entire file system.\nIf you know where the program will be handling files you can limit the results using the -onlyin command for instance to find files in your Desktop folder try:\nmdfind -onlyin ~/Desktop 'kMDItemContentModificationDate >= $time.now(-300)'\nYou don't mention much about the program.

Or if this is a program you control you could set an extended attribute explicitly and add that to the search criteria to make sure you only get the files from your program.\nFinally another option that is useful is the -live flag. It will stay connected and give you a tally of the number of files meeting the criteria.\n$ mdfind -onlyin ~/Desktop -live 'kMDItemContentModificationDate >= $time.now'\n[Type ctrl-C to exit]\nQuery update: 1 matches\nQuery update: 2 matches\n\nThis can be useful when all you need to know is that the process touched the file system. If your query is tight enough you know it will only change based on when those specific files are touched and then you can do whatever you need to do based on the fact that it happened.\n\nA: Try setting up a search in Finder like so:\n\nThis won't search system files however. For that you'll want to use EasyFind. It also won't specify which program modified the file.\n", "Q: Retina MacBook Pro (non-Force touch) trackpad can't \"click\" as usual I was working with my mid-2014 Retina MacBook Pro yesterday and everything was normal.

On my first iphone the data usage was both reasonable and logical at the beginning, but a couple months in and I was seeing a ridiculous increase of >5x usage.  I started off average 5-8 gb/month and by the time I stopped using the phone usage had gotten up to 20 gb HALF-WAY thru the month.  I know modern sites average 1-2 mb insize and I was conscious of my streaming.  My browsing habits didn't change that much and certainly not that much. I tried a few things like turning off vpn (although theoretically this shouldn't matter) but still had the crazy consumption.  I figured I must have picked up a virus.  \nOn 2nd iphone now and like the first usage was reasonable when new, then things started to ramp up.  This time it's to a lower extent and in fact I could be imagining it (or maybe not).  What I'm not imagining are the numbers in the cellular settings.  Usage for anything that uses data is listed individually and they're always supposed to add up to total usage at the top.  Just recently total usage has begun to doubled any app I've used, which is almost exclusively safari.  So I would have 2 gb usage in safari for one day (this still seems high) but total usage is 4gb.  There's no other listed app/process that makes up that remaining 2 gb and like I said I've been on safari exclusively.\nThe unaccounted for gigs clearly show there are processes going on out of the normal scope of the cellular settings (also my own knowledge that I've only used safari).  Is this a virus or something else?  Can I use an ios task manager equivalent (if there is one) to view all processes and help figure this out?\nAs an aside, another behavior I feel was not present originally on both phones but now is: the browser has to constantly refresh tabs as I switch between them, without ever closing safari.  Could be related.\n\nA: I have this too. 100s on MB per Day. AT&T carrier.  Started a few months ago.

Having an Apple Lightning connector cable beside my bed to charge my iPhone 6 at night, I asked myself whether the cable is safe for my three-years-old kids?\nI.e. having the cable dangling without an iPhone connected, my kids might stick their tongue right on the connector which is still plugged into the wall socket.\nI've read this thread and got no clear answer out of it.\nTherefore my question is:\nWould it be safe for my kids if they accidentially put their tongue on a Lightning connector or would they get a (severe) electric shock?\nUpdate 1:\nI just did a quick self-test and stuck my tongue to a Lightning connector which was still plugged into the wall socket.\nEven when trying to wrap my tongue around both sides, I felt no electric shock, not even a small prickling.\nThat said, I still love to get quality answers that are more sound than my own \"tests\".\n\nA: Whilst this is usually totally safe, there's a few caveats. I realise this isn't electrical engineering SE, but you asked for sound answers so I'll attempt to elaborate.\nAs others have stated the most important thing isn't the cable but what it's plugged in to. Lighting is a USB standard so we have 5V there, usually up to 2A. \nUnder the best case scenario this will come from a battery pack, forming a closed circuit, you might get a very small tingle but nothing too dramatic as the potential isn't enough to go through human tissue and cause and real damage. You can test this with a standard 9V battery on your tounge, it tickles but doesn't hurt, although I wouldn't recommend long term exposure due to DC bias, but that's another story.\nIf however were talking about a mains power supply, then that is the most important part. A good quality power supply will isolate the low voltage side from the mains voltage, as well as actively regulating the current and voltage passed. In this case it is still safe because earth/ground does not form a complete circuit. In the event of a faulty/low quality power supply however there may not be the electrical isolation between the mains and low voltage sides. This means that although the voltage between + and - is only 5V, there could be mains voltage between the low voltage side and earth/ground or any conductive materials connected to it (appliances etc). As there isn't the isolation, this could result in a nasty mains voltage shock.\nThat's not the end of the story though, whilst you may get a shock from a faulty/low quality power supply, and it will probably hurt, there are still other devices to protect you. I'll have to just speak for the UK here as I don't know the regulations elsewhere well enough, but all modern domestic circuits have RCD protection. These devises measure the current flowing out vs the current flowing back (simplified) and if there is a difference, i.e. the current is flowing through you instead, they turn the power off. These are calibrated so normally they trip quicker and at a lower current than is required to cause the body issues, but only after the initial painful shock (I speak from personal experience).\nIn summary, whilst lightening is exposed and there are better, less exposed connectors, if your using a good quality power supply from a reputable manufacturer on an RCD protected circuit, I'd say the risks are minimal. \n\nA: It should be very safe, if not harmless, for your children.\nReason being, the lightning connector puts a charge though at 5V with a negligible amount of amperage (not going to break out the ammeter to find out).\nWhat causes electric shocks is the amperage, the higher the more lethal. As mentioned in the thread, the amount of volts helps the charge travel easier.\nPhysics.SE and Electrical Engineering.SE probably have people who understand electricity better than I ever will, but I'll try and give an explanation:\nThink of a charge as a car, volts as fuel and amps as speed. If this car were to hit someone at high speed (equivalent to high amps) the person could get severely injured (a similar effect is seen in high-amperage electrocution). However, if the car is travelling at low speeds, the person is less likely to get severely injured. In both cases, the fuel (volts) doesn't really play a very big part in the analogy.\n(people better at me in electricity please do correct me if there are any mistakes)\nIn conclusion I'd say lightning connectors perfectly safe and you should have nothing to worry about.\n\nA: You should be more concerned about the brick (the one that plugs in to the outlet) rather than the lightning cable itself. Check the output amperage or wattage, the higher the value, the more \"shock\" you'll get. For iOS devices, those values are quite low. You'll get a shock (more like a surprise), but not severe.\n\nA: It is totally safe. A Lightning Cable is like a powered USB. In the worst case (an iPad), it's 5 V (and 12 W), far from enough for damaging your children. The fact that if the part touching is more sensible it doesn't mean more damage. Still, if the body part that touches the connectors is more conducting, they might feel a tiny \"shock\", but more like when sometimes you touch a metallic item and you feel a shock, nothing to do with touching an electric plug.\n\nA: My one year old puts phone cords in his mouth. It’s like he is addicted to them. I keep cords away from him, but if I am charging the phone and he is near me he is very drawn to the cord. When I first discovered him with the cord in his mouth, the end was smoking when I pulled it out. \nSo I believe the cords could be dangerous even if there is barely any amps running through. The electricity can still cause burns and perhaps fires. \n", "Q: Light-weight system monitor tool/app for OSX, Conky alternatives On common UNIX-like computer operating systems there was extremely flexible/customizeable/lightweight tool for System Stats monitoring, called Conky.

Is there a shortcut or such to send the currently active window to the back of the screen while still keeping it open (so that it ends up \"beneath\" all other open windows)?\n\nA: Your question isn't very clear, but if what you want is a shortcut to cycle through all windows of the currently active app, you should be able to do this with the Command~ keyboard shortcut.\nThe ~ key is usually located at left of the 1 key.\nJust to clarify, what the Command~ keyboard shortcut does is cycle through all windows of the current app you're in. For example, if you're using MS Word and have three documents open, it will cycle through those three documents.\nHowever, the Command~ keyboard shortcut does not cycle through Tabs. For example, if you have Safari open with three windows and each window has five tabs open, using this shortcut will cycle through the three windows, not through the individual tabs.\nAnother option that may achieve what you want is the CommandM keyboard shortcut. However this minimises the currently active window to the Dock, so I suspect that's not what you want.\nIf I've misunderstood your question totally, please clarify.\n\nA: Short answer: No, Apple does not provide an API that allows you to alter an application window index except by bringing a window to the front (index 1). There are no elegant solutions. But:\nLong answer: Yes, You can use AppleScript to effectively move a window to the back of a stack of AppleScript-able windows by collecting a list of windows, then rapidly moving each one (except the frontmost) to the front, leaving the chosen window at the back.\nHere is an example of an AppleScript which sends the frontmost Finder Window to the back.\ntell application \"Finder\"\n    set winList to every window whose visible is true\n    if not winList = {} then\n        repeat with oWin in (items 1 through -2 of reverse of winList)\n            set index of oWin to 1\n        end repeat\n    end if\nend tell\n\nThis script is based on a solution by JMichaelTX discussed on the KeyboardMaestro forum.\nThe reshuffling is incredibly fast, but in the Script Editor you can inspect how it works, leaving \"506\" on the bottom and popping \"502-505\" up in a way that preserves their order:\nget every window whose visible = true\n    --> {Finder window id 506, Finder window id 505, Finder window id 504, Finder window id 503, Finder window id 502}\nset index of Finder window id 502 to 1\n    --> 1\nset index of Finder window id 503 to 1\n    --> 1\nset index of Finder window id 504 to 1\n    --> 1\nset index of Finder window id 505 to 1\n    --> 1\n\nYou can map this AppleScript to a service or keyboard shortcut, either by a) putting the script into a Run AppleScript action inside an Automator service, or b) using a launcher (Alfred, Keyboard Maestro etc.). For details on Applescript keyboard assignment see: How do I assign a keyboard shortcut to an AppleScript I wrote?\nThis may satisfy OPs needs -- it is unclear from the original post. This solution can also be extended to multiple AppleScript-able applications. I am not, however, aware of a solution to make it work effectively with a mix of scriptable and non-scriptable windows, due to the fact that in AppleScript, System Events addressable windows for non-scriptable applications do not have a set index verb/property. There exists an \"AXRaise\" action for some windows when assistive devices / accessibility is turned on, but this also does not apply to all windows. Elaborate hacks exist that involve walking through each active application and show/hiding or minimizing/restoring windows, but they are a mess.\nRelated discussions:\n\n\n*\n\n*How to set a window's index to last (furthest back) in applescript\n\n*Applescript - Bring window to foreground\n\n*Is there a way to iterate over all open windows in Mac OS X?\n", "Q: Edit / Amended a previously annotated image in preview. I really like the annotation tool in preview, but when i annotate a jpg or png image and save it all the annotations get flattened into the image and cant be amended. \nIm aware that if you annotate a PDF it lets you save the PDF then come back to it and amend, but is it possible to annotate a jpg or png and then save it as a file format that will allow it to be amended ?\nCurrently if you take a jpeg on png and export as a pdf it will basically print as a pdf so it again flattens the image. \nExporting it as a pdf first then annotating it would work, but that requires users to remember to do that first as if they dont they have to start again from scratch. \n\nA: Preview app and the jpg and png file formats do not have this capability.

Why not reseat the HDD and see that the Mac boots or not. Then reseat the SSD. At that point, you'll have a repeatable scenario and can go about building up something that works or know that the Mac needs hardware service or a new cable perhaps or just had a failure at the same time as you swapped unrelated hardware.\n\nA: Since you are booting off a Recovery/Install USB you should have no problems erasing and partitioning your drive for use in your MBP.\nThere are a couple things that could be the issue here:\n\n\n*\n\n*The drive is defective.  It doesn't happen often but it does.\n\n*The SATA cable got damaged - this appears to be a common problem with Macs of this vintage.\n\n*There may be a SATA controller (logic board) issue.  Though this is the least likely of the three, it's not impossible so it bears mentioning.  If replacing the SATA drive and the SATA cable don't fix the issue, it's unfortunately a logic board issue meaning it will have to be replaced.\nDo you have an old drive you can try swapping the SSD out with to see if the problem continues?  If it does, the problem is your MBP; and most likely the cable as this is the component most people damage inadvertently.  If not the cable then there is an issue with your MBP\nIf you have a USB enclosure, you can try formatting and partitioning the drive attached to USB.  If it fails there - you know it's the drive.  If it works, then the issue is with your MBP (again, most likely the cable).  I use this adapter from Anker when working with \"questionable\" drives as it supports both 2.5\" (laptop) and 3.5\" (desktop) drives.\n\n", "Q: Specfic epubs downloaded outside the iBooks store not syncing on a particular mac I have a handful of epubs I downloaded outside of the iBooks Store and read them across two different macs and an iPhone. \nFor reasons I cannot explain some books’ data  (highlights, notes, place in book) will sync across the devices while others do not.\nThe following options are turned on in my iPhone settings:\n\n\n*\n\n*Sync Bookmarks and Notes\n\n*Sync Collections\n\n\nOn both macs I have the following turned on:\n\n\n*\n\n*Sync bookmarks, highlights, collections across devices\n\n\nI have not used syncing via iTunes.

On your linux based NAS do this:\nconvmv -r -f UTF-8 -t UTF-8 --nfc  .\n\nFrom the convmv man page:\n\nHFS+ on OS X / Darwin\n  Linux and (most?) other Unix-like operating systems use the so called normalization form C (NFC) for its UTF-8 encoding by default but do not enforce this. HFS+ on the Macintosh OS enforces normalization form D (NFD), where a few characters are encoded in a different way. On OS X it's not possible to create NFC UTF-8 filenames because this is prevented at filesystem layer. On HFS+ filenames are internally stored in UTF-16 and when converted back to UTF-8 (because the Unix based OS can't deal with UTF-16 directly), NFD is created for whatever reason. See http://developer.apple.com/qa/qa2001/qa1173.html for defails. I think it was a very bad idea and breaks many things under OS X which expect a normal POSIX conforming system. Anywhere else convmv is able to convert files from NFC to NFD or vice versa which makes interoperability with such systems a lot easier.\n\nBtw: This only happens when you transfer your files from a HFS+ partition. APFS doesn't enforce NFD anymore.\n", "Q: App-based folder organisation in iCloud I am trying to migrate my local files from my mac filesystem onto iCloud folders such that I can view and edit files using Pages and Numbers seamlessly from either my the local apps or the web interface. However something that's always confused me about iCloud is the location of these files. Does iCloud force me to put spreadsheets that I want to be able to edit from Numbers in the actual Numbers folder? \nSo for instance if I have client work that could be both documents and spreadsheets, in my local filesystem I would have something like\n\n\n*\n\n*Client A\n\n\n*\n\n*SS1.xls\n\n*SS2.xls\n\n*Letter1.doc\n\n*Letter2.doc\n\n\n*Client B\n\n\n*\n\n*SS3.xls\n\n*SS4.xls\n\n*Letter3.doc\n\n*Letter4.doc\n\n\n\nInstead iCloud would now force me to adopt the following structure:\n\n\n*\n\n*Numbers\n\n\n*\n\n*Client A\n\n\n*\n\n*SS1.xls\n\n*SS2.xls\n\n\n*Client B\n\n\n*\n\n*SS3.xls\n\n*SS4.xls\n\n\n\n*Pages\n\n\n*\n\n*Client A\n\n\n*\n\n*Letter1.doc\n\n*Letter2.doc\n\n\n*Client B\n\n\n*\n\n*Letter3.doc\n\n*Letter4.doc\n\n\n\n\nAm I missing something, or is this just what iCloud forces you to do?\n\nA: You aren't forced to use app-specific folders, it's just the initial setup. Why not just store things outside the app folders by dragging your existing file structure into the drive folder itself?\nOn OS X - iCloud drive works just the same as Dropbox. You get a folder and it syncs. Apple makes special folders for some apps and categories, but you don't have to use them. \nOn iOS - in the settings app under iCloud - enable the toggle that says \"Show on Home Screen\" for iCloud Drive and you can browse away just like Dropbox (and other file sync apps allow).\nAlso - finder tags are now portable across devices, so you could use tags as well to help categorize client files no matter where they are stored on the filesystem.\n", "Q: How do I get rid of \"movies\" taking up so much space? I have a MacBook Pro, and according to the info in About this Mac, about 67 GB of storage is \"movies\". I don't have any movies stored. What does this mean, and how do I free up the space? Also, how do I find out what is listed as \"Other\" so that I can clean up items stored there? Thanks!\n\nA: Firstly - do not worry about \"Other\". This is a catch-all category and will include lots of system-only files, uncategorizable files etc. Unless these are stored within your user home directories then don't worry about them.\nAccording to OSX Daily, the summary overview in Disk Utility will give a total for all video files - anywhere on the disk. Some of these may be in iTunes locations (including podcasts and iTunes U). A small few will be videos within system locations such as /System/Library/Compositions. You may find that a large number are part of your installed applications and their support libraries (this will depend on which applications you have installed, of course).\nOne way of searching for these video files is to use the Finder search box and type 'movie', then select 'kind = movie' from the system suggestions dropdown. Make sure that you select 'This Mac' for your search scope, and you should see all the files and their locations. There are lots of disk usage-reporting apps available to make this process simpler. \n\n\n*\n\n*Don't delete any files within /System or /Library. \n\n*Don't delete any\nfiles within /Applications or /Library/Application Support unless you\naccept the risk of breaking those apps and reinstalling them.\n\n", "Q: What are Macbook Charge Cycles? Okay so i dont know what a cycle is. \nCan you tell me that if I leave my macbook on charge all night, so at our place there our power outages so when my mac will start charging after the power comes back on will 1 cycle increase?\n\nA: A charge cycle is defined as 1 full discharge and 1 full recharge.   It is defined in the UN Manual of Tests and Criteria, Subsection 38.3:\n\nCycle means  one  sequence  of  fully  charging  and  fully \n  discharging  a  rechargeable cell or battery.\n\nThis means that if you only discharge your battery 20% and recharge it, you would have do to it 5 times to be a full cycle.  A 50% drain and recharge would have to happen twice to be considered a cycle.  And so on.\nSo in reference to your question, unless your battery fully drained, you didn't go through a cycle. \n\nA: You create charging cycles based on how you handle draining and charging your MacBook battery. The most efficient way to handle charging cycles is to allow your MacBook to drain completely before charging it to 100%.\nA typical MacBook battery is supposed to give you 1000 charging cycles until the battery reaches 80% of its original charging capacity. You can get the most charging capacity out of your battery by handling your charging cycles correctly as I described in the paragraph above.\nI hope this helps your understanding of how charging cycles work.\nEDIT: Think link should help\n", "Q: Configurator Stalled: How to force it to continue or quit?

Now I can't listen to audiobooks on repeat. Is there any way of getting back this functionality?\n\nA: Hmmm, I'd never noticed that (but then again, I wouldn't normally think to put an audio book on repeat).\nIf the main thing you want to achieve is to be able to play your audio book on your iPhone, and you want the ability to repeat them, then you can still actually play them using the Music iOS app.\nTo do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Within iTunes on your Mac or PC, add your audiobooks (they can be from any source, including Audible) to a playlist\n\n*Sync that playlist to your iPhone \n\n*Open the Music app on your iPhone\n\n*Select the playlist\n\n*Play any audiobook it contains (and use the repeat function)\n\n\nHope this helps!\n[EDIT]\nThis answer is being edited to cover a couple of scenarios that may affect the above steps working. Basically, with the latest versions of iOS and iTunes, plus the onset of Apple Music, the above instructions may not work for some people.\nIf you are in this situation, please use the following steps instead:\n\n\n*\n\n*Within iTunes on your Mac or PC, select the audiobook you want to play in the Music app on your iPhone/iPad/iPod.\n\n*Richt-click on the audiobook and choose Get Info from the context menu that appears.\n\n*Click on the Options tab.\n\n*At the top for Media Kind you should see Audiobook selected. Change this to Music instead. (Note, if you'd like to listen to your Audiobook using the Podcasts app instead, then select Podcast instead of Music. However, since the OP is wanting to use the 'repeat' function, we need to use the Music app.)\n\n*Ensure that Remember playback position is selected.\n\n*Click OK.\n\n*Now add your Audiobook to a playlist (perhaps one called Audiobooks).\n\n*Sync that playlist to your iPhone.\n\n*Open the Music app on your iPhone.\n\n*Select the playlist.\n\n*Play the audiobook and use the repeat function of the Music app.\n\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES\nIf you are using Apple Music and iCloud Music Library is switched on in your device, you must also do this step: \n\n\n*\n\n*After Step 6 and before Step 7: Right-click on the Audiobook file and select Add to iCloud Music Library. \n\n*This additional step can actually take anywhere from a few hours to days (not to upload, but for the iCloud music servers to process the file). So, while you can continue with Steps 7 to 11 above, the file won't be available on your device until the file has actually finished processing. The way to tell this is to check that the dotted cloud icon next to the audiobook listed in iTunes is no longer a dotted line to indicate it is waiting.\n\n*And yes, as far as I am concerned Apple Music and the iCloud Music Library have 'broken' the way many people want to use playlists - but that's another story!\n\n", "Q: El Capitan, can't rsync, tar, cp certain files on Promise raid First off: I'm a Linux Admin, but have to do a few MacOS things around the place (had very little exposure to it previously). \nOne of the tasks I have is to take a backup-copy of a 10TB Promise Pegasus2 array attached to a mac-mini running el capitan 10.11.4.\nI'm root on the mac (sudo -i from admin account).\nI'm trying to rsync the data from the array to a backup server with ample storage (a Linux box).

Those processes, too, just get stuck, typically on files within Backups.backupdb which seem to be TimeMachine data? It's always a file with the extension .key. Is there ANY way at all to copy these? I assume it's a privilege thing as Disk Utility -> First Aid showed no problems with the file-system.\nEdit3:\nI still don't understand why a simple cp of the files that are acting up w/ any other means works, but that seems to be the status quo.

So the syntax I use is:\n$ sudo rsync -vaE --progress [source path] [destination path]\n\nI'd try using one or more of those flags in the command.

I need both of them and I am wondering if it is possible to buy them together or if I have to get two separate items?\nAlso I am seeing a lot of third party Thunderbolt>HDMI adapters for cheap and then no generic Ethernet adapters, only the stock (expensive) Apple ones. Is there a way to get an off brand Ethernet adapter?\n\nA: Yes - there are quite a few docks to connect one cable to a Mac and have gigabit ethernet as well as HDMI out (and some even support 4K resolution on the HDMI).\n\n\n*\n\n*Elgato https://www.elgato.com/en/thunderbolt-2-dock\n\n*Belkin http://www.belkin.com/us/p/P-F4U085/\n\n*Sonnet http://www.sonnettech.com/product/echo15thunderboltdock.html\n\n*OWC https://eshop.macsales.com/shop/Thunderbolt/Dock/OWC/Thunderbolt2-Dock/\nI've linked to the top of the line thunderbolt 2 versions of the docks. If you don't need the fastest speed look for older models of 10 Gbps thunderbolt as refurb/used or still new stock which are discounted in price from the faster 20 Gbps models.\nIt's far cheaper to buy two single use adapters, though - the electronics are smaller and less complicated than needed for a full dock that takes one cable and splits into multiple functions.\n\nA: I think you have to get them separately. Have you thought about using an ethernet to usb adapter? Those are cheap. Then again, the ethernet to thunderbolt from Apple isn't bad ($30). USB 2.0 may have (although it would be unlikely) a speed bottleneck. Ignoring this, there are many generic adapters for ethernet to USB. I'd make the choice based on which port you would rather have unused rather than price. The difference will probably be at most $20.\n", "Q: How do I find a recently added contact? I recently met someone and got them to type their info into my contacts.  I was really busy for a few days and didn't get around to contacting them.  Now I can't remember their name.  Is there a way to view the most recent additions to my contacts list?\n\nA: On iPhone, you can download several different apps.\nThe one I found was free, quick, and simple called 'Recent Contacts' by Kyle Gorlick. \nOn Android there are also several apps, but I have not tried them myself.\n\nA: The built-in contacts app doesn't provide a user-friendly way to search by 'most recent'.  This app is very basic and is good for most users but, as you've experienced, if you need something a bit more advanced, it won't work as well.  You can try doing a Spotlight search by the location you were at or by the company that person works for, any little thing they might've added to their contact on your iPhone.\nIf none of those approaches work, and you're not willing to jailbreak to get access to the Contacts database, you can try going thru each name one-by-one until you see it.  It's slow and annoying, but it works.\n\nA: I've discovered a free app called iContacts+ (there are several such apps, I just grabbed the first that didn't look too ghastly).  It allowed me to search by most recent addition.\n\nA: I've made an app to see recently added contacts. It's not free, but apart from those others, it has a widget.\n\nA: Recents is another that's available on the iPhone that I find attractive.  It's also well reviewed with 4.5/5 stars from 14 reviewers.  I haven't personally had cause to try it.\n\nA: I add my contacts to a Group I created called \"recent contacts\" and then remove them after I synch to salesforce database or tag them with the info needed to recall them. Its a non-app workaround but works for me.\n\nA: Links is a newer app that syncs with the Contacts app. You add new contacts through it and it creates a timeline of when they were added. It also stores where you were, which is a cool feature. The full name is Links the Contacts Companion.\n\nA: Contacts by creation app from appstore is all you need.\n\nA: There’s a new free iOS app (I just created) called Recent Contacts - Reco by Tav Shande. \nLink: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/recent-contacts-reco/id1447780700?mt=8\nI’m currently working on an android version too. It also has a feature called auto photo finder which will automatically find profile photos of your contacts via Google contacts api.\n\n", "Q: Does the weight of iOS devices change based on storage size? I don't think this is just true of Apple products but the weight advertised for iOS device model of varying storage size is always same.\nFor example the weight of the iPad Pro is 437 grams. Is this the same for all models?\nDoes an increase in storage size add extra weight?\nIs the weight difference so minuscule that it is not mentioned? \n\nA: The 128GB and 256GB variants don't have any more chips than the 32GB model. They still have one chip, that has smaller cells and hence higher storage density, but it takes up the same volume and weight.\nEven if this is not true, the difference in mass is likely to be within a gram or two. It's not significant enough to note.\nSource: iFixit teardown for the iPad Pro. As you can see, the logic board has no space for any additional flash memory chips.\n", "Q: System Integrity Protection (SIP) creating problem for oci_connect(): OCIEnvNlsCreate() After I upgraded my OS to El Capitan (which comes with SIP), I am getting error in oci_connect()\n\nWarning: oci_connect(): OCIEnvNlsCreate() failed. There is something wrong with your system - please check that DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH includes the directory with Oracle Instant Client libraries\n\nIf I disable the SIP, everything works fine again.

My battery has become quite a pain in the neck recently, It's not lasting much more than about 2 or 3 hours and that's usually just using basic programs like chrome or pages etc. It's difficult for me because I use it quite a lot at school, and unfortunately school is a lot longer than 2-3 hours...I also use a lot of very intensive programs like blender and unity, but usually I try to only do that at home with my charger.\n\nAt the moment it tells me I've done 621 cycles and tells me its in normal condition (pfft, normal...) Is that actually normal? Also, should I be thinking about replacing it with a new one, if so, is it expensive and will it actually make much of a difference, and if it shouldn't be replaced what can I do to make it better?\nThanks, Matthew\nEdit:\nThis is what CoconutBattery tells me:\n\n\nA: Charge Cycle means nothing, assume you plugged in all the time for 5 or 6 years, the cycle is still 0 but does it mean your battery is 100% health? No.\nYou should search for your macbook model to find out what is the design capacity of your macbook, and divided by your current max full charge capacity to find out the health of the battery. Or you may download some software that help you to calculate automatically.\nLet say for the below screenshot, macbook pro design capacity is 8450mah, but now my maximum charge is 8429mah, so the health is 8429/8450 = 99.8%\n\n\nA: You haven't mentioned what's the model of the Mac you are using, Apple's Determining battery cycle count for Mac notebooks  will tell you more about the Charge Cycle.\nAlso in case you are still in warranty, which I assume you are not cause of so many charge cycles, you can go to the Apple Store and get the battery diagnosed, if they find a problem they will replace it.\n", "Q: Not enough free space on OS X Base System while installing El Capitan with VirtualBox I am getting an error while installing OS on Virtual Box machine, that there is not enough free space as shown in the image. I allocated 20GB while setting up virtual machine, and 8.8GB is what apple says that I need here\n\nI went to disk Utility->Disk Utility of VirtualMachine and tried changing partitioning of the VM. It cant be done. It also shows the instructions I need to take, but the \"Enable Journaling\" command is greyed out. What could be the problem?\nIt also says I am using CD ROM media, but I am not. The El Capitan iso file, that was linked to VM in the Storage tab of setting up VM, is on Desktop.\nThese are the screenshots for better illustration.\n\n\n\n\nA: By accident I tried to install OS X to the OS X Installer DVD iso file (mounted to the virtual VBOX CD-ROM device) itself.\nErasing/partitioning the VBOX HARDDISK disk (see images in question) and creating a new HFS+ Journaled formatted volume seems to work.\n\nA: I erased the partition VBOX HARDDISK while naming it \"UsableDisk\" and rebooted the virtual machine.\nThis time I could see \"UsableDisk\" as an option on \"Install OS X\" screen as shown above. Choosing it to install the the OS X resolved the issue. Took around 15 minutes for install to complete.\n\nA: What sanjihan said is right.

What can I do? I have tried a different charger, Everything I need to say is mentioned in the question.\n\nA: Could be a simple issue, your charge port maybe full of dust / dirt. \nGet a wooden cocktail stick and gently remove the dirt from the charge point, this will allow your charger to hit your iPad's charge connection points.\n", "Q: Unable to verify iOS 9.3.1 Update I can't install iOS 9.3.1 even though its downloaded. It fails at verification. My phone is connected to the Internet and it's working perfectly (yes I've tested). I've restarted my iPhone but no luck. I'm currently on iOS 9.3.\n\n\nA: Usually such an error will occur when one or more Apple servers serving that area is down or perhaps it might have to do with either some proxy settings on your providers side if not on your phone side as I've often seen such responses with people having Global HTTP Proxy enabled on their iPhones. \nI'd suggest you to try and connect to a WiFi network and try again. \n", "Q: How to jailbreak my iPhone 5S with iOS 9.2.1 or iOS 9.3?

Someone has to hook up a keyboard to the Mac and physically log in and log back out. Once the machine has been logged in locally I can once again log in remotely via Mac.\nI'm using the Mac's built-in VNC as well as an installed RealVNC server. Neither will respond after a reboot.\nI edited the RealVNC launch daemon to run at load but that didn't work.\nUPDATE\nThe mac has filevault turned on.  'sudo fdesetup authrestart' will work with a manual reboot. It will not work however with a forced system reboot or a power outage.  Someone would still need to manually login with a keyboard in those cases. \nThe options at this point seem to be to disable Filevault or accept the fact that a person will need to login occasionally. \n\nA: VNC is tricky to use on a headless system.  The way it works is that it queries the display server to get the settings so VNC can send those settings to the viewer.  If nothing is connected, no parameters are sent and thus the viewer has no idea what to display.  This is why I am not a fan of VNC or ARD and will only use it if I absolutely have to (95% of everything I do on headless systems is in Terminal, so this doesn't come up very often for me)\nThis is why you have to hook up a monitor to get screen sharing to work again.  If you leave the monitor attached, VNC will work with no problems across reboots\nTrick OS X into Thinking a Display is Still Attached\nThe easiest thing I have seen that solves this problem is getting a Dummy Display Emulator.  It's clean, it's easy, and it works out the box.  What it does is make OS X think a monitor is still plugged into the display so whatever settings you have configured for that \"monitor\" will be sent to the VNC viewer.\n\nYou can make your own but to me, this is not safe and very sloppy for a permanent installation.  I included this option both for reference to see what is being done here (how easy it is) and to provide another option if you are in a pinch.  Again, I am not a fan of this DIY hack because it's not clean and if you don't have the mDP to VGA adapter or the resistor you will have to purchase them anyway and you might only save a couple of bucks over the commercial product.\nYou could read the linked blog on how to do this, but the picture below alone should tell you what to do, what Apple display adapter you need, and what resistor to buy based on its color codes.\n\n\nA: The solution to the problem ended up being three-fold.\nThe mac has filevault turned on.  'sudo fdesetup authrestart' will work with a manual reboot. It will not work however with a forced system reboot or a power outage. \n\n\n*\n\n*.bash_profile a command alias to 'sudo fdesetup authrestart'.  I used 'reboot'.  Now from the terminal I can type 'reboot' to property restart the system.\n\n*Use a UPS for power outages\n\n\n\n\n\n*If VNC becomes unresponsive ssh into the box and reboot via 'sudo fdesetup authrestart'\n\n\nA: Disable file vault on your startup disk, move sensitive data to another volume, and encrypt it with FileVault or some other means. I think in that case MacOS does not require a password before the OS loads. \n\nA: Apple supports this out of the box. Under the Sharing preference pane you need to enable either the Screen Sharing or the Remote Management and then use the Computer Settings dialog to enable VNC.\n\nThe service starts up automatically when incoming network traffic on the VNC ports is detected by the OS. Now, you do need to get past any FileVault pre-login screen where the full actual OS isn't running yet. To restart and skip FileVault one time, use:\nfdesetup authrestart\n\nYou might need to watch for DHCP traffic and see if the Mac is rejoining the network and asking for an address from the router if you can't find the machine on reboot. For troubleshooting, you could assign a static IP address so that you're sure it's not a DHCP issue.\nThe problem also could be your choice of VNC client and it's not expecting to connect to OS X Lion or newer. Some older clients break when Apple allows a choice to connect to the logged in user or a new login window. The client needs to reconnect once the session drops to log you in.\n\n\n*\n\n*Are the changes to Lion's screen sharing documented anywhere publicly?\n\n*RealVNC on Lion\nOne client I like on iOS and Mac OS X is http://edovia.com/screens/ Of course Apple's free Screen Sharing app (look for it in /System/Library/CoreServices/Applications ) and Apple Remote Desktop work well, too.\n\nA: If you want to remotely restart the machine without having to specify the user then you can specify an input file in the form of a plist. Do the following steps on the computer that you are remoting into:\n\n\n*\n\n*First you need to create a plist file that will have your\ncredentials, open up a terminal window and paste the following:\ntouch ~/.restart.plist. Now open up that plist file in a text\neditor and paste the following:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n<key>Username</key>\n<string>USERNAME_HERE</string>\n<key>Password</key>\n<string>PASSWORD_HERE</string>\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\n\n*Replace USERNAME_HERE and PASSWORD_HERE in the file above with your credentials and save the file.\n\n*Create an alias in your bash profile so that all you\nhave to do is type reboot and it will do the rest for you. Open up\nyour ~/.bash_profile in a text editor and add the line alias\nreboot=\"sudo fdesetup authrestart -inputplist < ~/.restart.plist\" then save the file.\n\n*Close and reopen your terminal window, or type in source ~/.bash_profile in order to update your alias to match the bash profile.\n\n\nNow you'll be able to restart your remote computer with a specific user just by typing reboot into your terminal!\nSource\n", "Q: A way for whole Calendar to show after swiping down in Iphone I want to see the whole calendar after swiping down.

I'm using Ubuntu/Chrome if it can help.\n\nA: Login to iCloud, go to Find My iPhone, select your phone in the drop down list on the top of the page, provided it has Find My iPhone enabled it should show up as offline. Lost mode should be available. \n\nA: Airplane Mode disables any cellular service and wifi. You can only hope that the person who finds the iPhone will turn off Airplane Mode, and the iPhone will reconnect to cellular service. The iCloud server will then 'see' the iPhone and set it into Lost mode. Until Airplane Mode is disabled, you are out of luck.\nIn addition, you will have had to deliberately configured your iPhone to use Find My iPhone.

I was gifted a MacBook Pro but the giver rescinded the gift and has locked the laptop;  I agreed to return it providing I was assured the laptop would be unlocked long enough for me to download my research, manuscript and a screenplay.\nSo far the person has refused to unlock it and has threatened to wipe 6 months of my work from the laptop.  I have the device.  Can the person do that remotely?  \n\nA: The person does have the ability to remotely erase it via Find My Mac.\n\nA: If you or somebody else can remove the HD from the laptop and mount it (not boot from it) in an external case or  a HD Dock, the data might be accessible unless the disk has been encrypted.\n\nA: If you have another Macintosh handy, it is possible to use target disk mode.  Reboot the MacBook Pro with the 'T' key held down; this will make the computer act as an external hard disk drive, which you can plug into another Mac with a Firewire or Thunderbolt cable.   Disassembly is unnecessary.\nCopy off any files you require, to a USB key, or burn to a CD or DVD, then erase them (or secure-erase) as may be appropriate.   I don't know how this will interact with 'locking' software. \n", "Q: How do I backup 2 external hard disks to 1 external hard disk? I currently own two 2 TB external hard disk and one 5 TB external hard disk. Is it possible to backup the two 2 TB external HDDs to the 5 TB external HDD using my Mac?\n\nA: This can even be done in Time Machine:\nChoose the 5 TB HDD as only Time Machine backup drive (OK, my disks are smaller  ):\n\nThen exclude your internal drive by adding it to the excluded items - the backup drive is excluded automatically:\n\nThe final result:\nYou get a folder Backups.backupdb with one folder vm (the name of my Mac) containing folders (with date names representing the backup date) and each with two folders representing the two drives (Data1 and Encrypted). I added and modified files successively on both volumes and initiated a backup after each step.\n\n\nNeedless to say: it's recommended to backup your main drive/system drive also!\n", "Q: Why can't I install an app (says \"could not be found\")? I just got an iPhone SE. I did a backup from my 4, then told iTunes to restore the new phone from the backup.\nIt said there were a bunch of apps it couldn't install because they cannot be found.\nAs just one example, Access RPN is on my 4, shows in my iTunes under \"My Apps\", but without art. When I go to the iTunes Store link, it says \"Downloaded\" so I can't redownload it.\nHow do I fix this?\nEDIT:\nI found an Apple page that says to do this I need an iTunes backup, AND a phone that's not set up. So I erased my SE and tried again. This got many more of the apps installed and their data recovered, but some still aren't working. Access RPN, my example app, still does not work.\n\nA: Ok, in iTunes on the computer, it says \"Downloaded\". But on the device itself, go to\nApp Store -> Updates -> Purchased -> My Purchases\nand select the \"Not on this iPhone\" tab. That shows all apps that didn't get transferred. Click the cloud icon to download them.\nThis even preserved the apps' data, because I had done a backup first.\n\nA: On my case, the root cause* was different, and I got it fixed.

I'm replacing the hard-drive on my 2010 Macbook Pro, (This machine just keeps going, and I'm finally upgrading it to a SSD!) and I'm almost done (it's simple enough) but the plastic tab from the original hard drive just won't stick to the new SSD. I was wondering if I can use some electrical tape instead? I know that short-term it shouldn't be an issue, but these machines can get really hot and I'm afraid that the tape might turn into a gummy mess inside my computer over time. Has anyone tried this? Did it last?\n\nA: I definitely would not use electrical tape. Honestly, if for some reason you do not have the plastic tab that came on the HDD, then you can go without it when you replace it with the SSD. The opening is large enough you can get a finger between the SSD and the side rails, should you ever need to replace it. You can see this article for another opinion on the matter.\n\nA: I have had luck using double sided tape when working my Macs. You need to buy a good brand such as Scotch. Price should be < $4 US. Although, I have never tried using this tape to hold the plastic tab on a drive.\n\n", "Q: Install FreeDOS via Bootcamp Is it possible to run FreeDOS via Bootcamp on a Mac?\nIf so, what are the instructions for doing so?\n\nA: There were a few housekeeping chores that I preformed before booting from the FreeDOS DVD. I have both Yosemite and El Capitan installed on my Mac. To avoid SIP problems, I chose to preform the chores while booted to Yosemite. SIP was still enabled, but Yosemite ignores the SIP settings. I assume you can use El Capitan with SIP disabled.\nI required the partition, that I chose to install FreeDos, to meet certain requirements. \n\n\n*\n\n*The partition must be formatted MS-DOS (FAT) by the Disk Utility\napplication. Note: Later when installing FreeDOS, I reformatted the\npartition again.\n\n*The partition must appear in the the Master Boot Record (MBR)\npartition table. The contains of the this table can be displayed by\nusing the following command.\nsudo  fdisk  /dev/disk0\n\nIf you are installing on a second internal disk, then replace\ndisk0 with disk1.\n\n*The id shown in the MBR table for this partition must be 0C. This\nusually occurs after formatting the partition as MS-DOS (FAT). In my\ncase, I first had to format the partition as \"Mac OS Extended\n(Journaled)\", then format as MS-DOS (FAT). This must be a bug in the\nDisk Utility.\n\n*The partition must be flagged as active in the MBR table. By\n\"active\", I mean \"bootable\". The active partition is marked with an\nasterisk * character in first column of the output from the\nsudo  fdisk /dev/disk0\n\ncommand. You can use the\nsudo  fdisk  -e  /dev/disk0\n\ncommand to change the active partition. The proper interactive\ncommand is flag.\n\nNote: More information on the fdisk command can be found by entering the command man  fdisk or online here.\n\nI also had additional requirements. \n\n\n*\n\n*The Mac needs to be set to boot using legacy mode. This can be done\nwith the bless command. In my case, I was installing to the 4th\npartition on disk 0, so I used the following.\nsudo  bless  --device  /dev/disk0s4  --setBoot  --legacy\n\nThe 0 represents disk0 and the 4 represents the 4th partition.\nActually, when booting in legacy mode, the partition is chosen by\nthe bootstrap code stored in the MBR. It is safe to assume this code\nwill choose the partition set active in the above step 4. So when\nbooting, the partition value set by the bless command will be\nignored.\n\n*The MBR must contain valid bootstrap code or no bootstrap code. OS X\nis installed without this code. This is why you see the warning\nmessage below when using the fdisk command to change the MBR.\nfdisk: could not open MBR file /usr/standalone/i386/boot0: No such file or directory\n\nWhen I installed FreeDOS, the MBR contained the bootstrap code that\nwas being used by Windows 10.  You can view the contents of your MBR\nby using the following command.\nsudo  hexdump  -C  -v  -n  512  /dev/disk0\n\nIf you are unsure if the bootstrap code in your MBR is valid, you\ncan zero out this memory by using the following command. The\nbootstrap code occupies hex addresses 0 through 1B7.\nsudo  fdisk  -u  -f  /dev/zero  -y  /dev/disk0\n\nAt this point, you should be able to start installing FreeDOS using the DVD. I chose to install everything.\nWhen I reached the display shown below, the computer seemed to freeze. In reality, the computer was just taking a long time to install software. More that just the Kernel is being installed here. This is why the progress bar does not seem to change. \n\nAlso, in some of the subsequent steps, I needed to press the space bar several times before the installation would proceed.\nWhen reached the step associated with the display below, I chose 1.\n\n", "Q: Movies purchased on itunes Why can't I watch my purchased itune movies offline on my MacBook Pro?\nno wifi no movie yet I have purchased all of them.\n\nA: You can. The content needs to be read from somewhere though, so you will need to download the multimedia directly to your hard drive. You can do so directly via the iTunes.app that typically lives in the dock at the bottom of your screen.\n", "Q: Applescript/Automator task to change default downloads folder I need to create an automation to make a new folder named by my selected text and then make that folder the new default Safari downloads folder. This would be the default folder when I click on a download file link from a webpage until I run the script again for a new selection. \nedit: this may seem trivial but I have to click a URL to download 5-8 .pdf files (I have to click on each file separately) per order for about 30 orders a day and I have to make a folder named by the the order number to put the files in. I have done a lot of research and I'm not sure if this is something that can be done with AppleScript or if it also requires Shell script and is something I will have to pay for to be developed.

Simply hit Choose. If you then right-click the download link -> Download linked file as…, the file will be downloaded to the new folder.\nThe script may be improved further, because I didn't get it to work to set the new folder as new download destination automatically.\n", "Q: Is there a `watch` command native to Darwin/OS X? I have a script that I'm trying to port from Linux to Darwin/OS X. The Linux version currently depends on the watch command, which doesn't appear to be installed on Darwin/OS X by default. What's the native alternative?\n\nA: There is no native alternative. You must acquire watch from using Homebrew (brew install watch) or MacPorts (port install watch) if you require an actual executable.\nYou can however, emulate the function of watch. That can be accomplished in a standard bash while loop (from Stack Overflow by Daniel Pittman):\n\nYou can emulate the basic functionality with the shell loop:\nwhile :; do clear; your_command; sleep 2; done\n\nThat will loop forever, clear the screen, run your command, and wait two seconds - the basic watch your_command implementation.\nYou can take this a step further and create a watch.sh script that can\n  accept your_command and sleep_duration as parameters:\n#!/bin/bash\n# usage: watch.sh <your_command> <sleep_duration>\n\nwhile :;\n  do\n  clear\n  date\n  $1\n  sleep\n  $2\ndone\n\n\nThat, and other options, are available on Stack Overflow.\n", "Q: Can't play audio to Denon DA-300USB DAC I just got a Denon DA-300USB DAC, which requires drivers on the PC side but claims to work on the Mac without them (not unusual).  This of course also means the user guide is useless, and seems to think things will Just Work(tm), but when the DAC is configured for USB input (using the little picker on the front-panel) it says \"Unlock\" when there is no audio, and \"Unsupported\" any time I try to play audio.\nI don't think this is just a DRM issue with iTunes audio, but I can't find anything on google to suggest what I should tweak (it shows up fine in the sound control panel, like my previous BitHead DAC).\n\nA: It turns out the answer is reasonably simple, and completely obtuse.\nYou need to open the \"Audio MIDI Setup\" application (in /Applications/Utilities, if you haven't moved it), show the \"Audio Devices\" window (if it isn't open already), and choose the USB High Speed Audio device (hopefully there's only one - it should show '0 in / 2 out' for the DA-300).\nThe default format for output is 352800 Hz, but the DA-300 only supports 192000Hz.  Simply change the format popup for Hz to 192000 and you should be in business.  Both 2ch-24bit and 2ch-32bit sound work, although depending on your source data you may be happier with 24bit.\n", "Q: Vim 7.4 hybrid line numbers not working (installed via Homebrew) I recently discovered that Vim 7.4 enables a hybrid number mode, such that if you do set nu and set rnu, you'll see the absolute line number of the current line and relative line numbers everywhere else (see here and here). I set this up on a Linux machine and it works great. Unfortunately it's not working on my Mac (El Capitan). If I type :set rnu I'll get relative numbers with 0 at the cursor line, and if I then type :set nu it will switch to only absolute line numbers, unlike what I see on the Linux machine. I have Vim 7.4 installed via Homebrew. How do I get this to work? Do I need to reinstall with some particular setting?\n\nA: It turns out the problem was not with Vim 7.4, Homebrew, Macs, or any combination of the 3. Just my brain. I was used to vi pointing to the vim that I want, but in my case vim points to the Homebrewed version and vi points to the version originally on my Mac, which was Vim 7.3. I usually use vi and vim interchangeably and that shot me in the foot here. I have vi aliased to the Homebrewed Vim now and everything is dandy.\n", "Q: date recorded on iPhone 4 from camera or phone? when sending a pic from nikkon camera to iPhone 4, will the date recorded be the one taken from the camera or the current date on the iPhone 4?\n\nA: The data will be that which was written to the original metadata taken on your Nikon camera. Unless of course you're doing some kind of image conversion or editing on your phone, then something could change. \n", "Q: Opening a specific page on Mac Preview from Terminal How I can modify the open filename.pdf command so that I can open a desired page number directly without having to scroll down.\n\nA: Unfortunately the open command does not have an option to pass to Preview to tell it to go to a given page.  Additionally, Preview does not have an AppleScript Dictionary to make scripting a solution easier, however it's not impossible.  The bash script below takes two arguments, the filename of the document to open and the page number to go to. Note that if the target file to open is not in the working directory in Terminal then the fully qualified pathname must be used.\nYou'll need to create a file to place this code into and make it executable. It should be in a directory that is in the $PATH, otherwise, to use it, you'll have to provide the fully qualified pathname to the executable or use ./executable if at the working directory of the executable in Terminal.\nFor this example, using the default Terminal, which opens to one's Home Directory:\ntouch OpenToPage\nopen OpenToPage\n\nNow copy and paste the code, from the Code: section below, into the opened document and save it, then close it.\nWhile still in Terminal, make the file executable:\nchmod u+x OpenToPage\n\nTo use OpenToPage:\n./opentopage /path/name/to/filename.pdf 3\n\nOr: \n./opentopage '/path/name/to/file name.pdf' 3\n\n./opentopage /path/name/to/file\\ name.pdf 3\n\n\nCode:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nif [[ -z $2 ]]; then\n    [[ -z $1 ]] && printf \"\\n Missing Filename...\"\n    printf \"\\n Missing Page Number...\\n\\n\"\n    printf \"   Syntax: OpenToPage Filename Page_Number\\n\"\n    printf \"   Example: OpenToPage Filename.pdf 3\\n\\n\"\n    exit 1\nelse\n    open -a Preview \"$1\"\n    sleep .5\n    osascript -e 'tell application \"Preview\" to activate' \\\n              -e 'delay 0.25' \\\n              -e 'tell application \"System Events\" to tell process \"Preview\" to click menu item \"Go to Page…\" of menu \"Go\" of menu bar 1' \\\n              -e 'delay 0.25' \\\n              -e \"tell application \\\"System Events\\\" to keystroke \\\"$2\\\"\" \\\n              -e 'delay 0.25' \\\n              -e 'tell application \"System Events\" to key code 36'\nfi\nexit 0\n\n\nNotes: If the target filename and or pathname has spaces, the spaces must be escaped with a \\ (backslash) or the target filename and or pathname must be quoted, but not both.\nThe sleep and delay times can be adjusted if/as necessary.  As the script is presently written the timings adds 1.25 seconds total to the whole process and should probably be fine as is. If I had to adjust anything I'd change the value of sleep, to .75 or 1, before modifying the values of delay.\nThe naming of the bash script file in this answer is arbitrary, name it whatever you like, e.g. otp or o2p for open to page, etc.\n", "Q: iPhone 5s Battery Ok here's the breakdown: I just bought an iPhone 5s from a girl on the Internet. It wasn't in perfect condition but nothing was wrong to make it not run good. I was only on the phone for about 20 minutes and it was at full charge when I got it. It shut off at 20 minutes from dying so quickly. Then today it did the same thing. The battery percentage drops insanely fast and charges in weird leaps sometimes too. I assumed that I would have to buy another battery which I can't really do at the moment. I called the Apple Store but the guy that answered was a little impolite and seemed like he was just trying to get me off the phone already. He said I would need to buy a new battery for it.\nWhat I'm wondering is if this might just be temporary? The person I bought it from told me she replaced the battery in August of '15 and hasn't used the phone since November '15 (roughly six months of non-use). Could it just be that the phone hasn't ran in a while and that it just needs to be drained and charged a few times? Or is a new battery the only solution?\nP.S. I just spent the money on this new phone, and I don't really have enough money for a new battery from Apple which I was told is about $100. Are the self-help battery kits on amazon and such reliable if needed?\n\nA: You could try, charging and uncharging it a few times, it might help. But I wouldn't really rely on that. I bought a replacement battery for my iPhone 5 via iFixit and I am really happy with it - it shouldn't be much more than 1/4 of the price you named. So make sure you don't get an extra cheap one of eBay, those won't make you happy for long.\n", "Q: Month old iPad mini 4 has a yellow box outline on the screen!

I'm running OS X 10.11.4.\n\nI looked up on google and found out that it could be related to a blacklisted ethernet driver. I decided to allow but then i turned off the machine. Could this be some malware or it just an update from Apple?\n\nA: Without knowing anything about your machine (i.e. what OS are you on?  possibly not El Capitan (OS 10.11.x), but that's an educated guess...) it is difficult to say, BUT Apple would update your computer through the Apple Store, and it would not just dump a Kernel Extension like that.  About your Kext there, I would not have a clue, but a quick google does not come up with exctitingly good news.

I would like to build a tool which analyses someone's emails.\nIs it possible on iOS or OS X to build something which gets access to emails?\n\nA: Yes it is possible to get access to a user's e-mails. This assumes the e-mails are stored on a server and the user gives you access.

I was told that I had to erase the disk and format it to OS X Extended (Journal) with the Disk utility program. \nHowever, Disk Utility won't allow me to erase it, and the partition button is greyed out. I will attach some screenshots of the problem:\n\n\nAny help is appreciated!\n\nA: In Disk Utility find the HDD you are trying to format in the left hand column. Select the disk and not the volume - that appears as child under it - to repartition it. \nJust choosing the volume erases or replaces the file system but not the partition table type. This may apparently fail if the partition map is mal-formed.\n\nIf you feel confident with terminal, you may use instructions from other topics, alike this one. \n", "Q: Open applications in the background in OS X, I don't want my focus taken from me.

If it boots fine externally, you can be fairly certain that there's an issue with the cable (or, less likely, the Logic Board).\nIf you still have trouble when it's connected externally, then you should first try reinstalling the OS while it's connected externally (as you might still have some software corruption). If it persists after that point, you likely have a bad hard drive.\n\nA: Could be due to kernel extensions you have installed, I had the same issue and posted a blog tutorial on troubleshooting and fixing something like that:\nhttps://smyl.es/how-to-fix-mac-osx-stuckhanging-on-progress-bar-will-not-boot/\n", "Q: How to have the counter of characters when I am writing a texto (SMS)?

The download is an installer, so I'm wondering if anyone knows of an uninstaller. Else I guess I'll just dump it in the trash.\n\nA: Exactly. To delete an Application that is not sandboxed (not downloaded from App Store) you have to go in /Applications/ and delete the Application File.\n\nA: I used AppCleaner.app to make sure I don't have any leftovers. And it turned out there were a lot, namely crash reports, plists, diagnostics, cookies and more.\nJust make sure no Safari files are included in the list of files about to be deleted. In my case there were no such files, it was either plugin related crash reports (e.g. VLC plugin) or other files clearly related to Safari Technology Preview.\n\nA: I would highly recommend an app cleaner or uninstaller.

If this works for you we can expand to looping through the folders in the top-level folder.\ntell application \"Finder\"\n    set the_folder to choose folder\n    set the_folder_name to name of the_folder\n    set the_subfolders to every folder in the_folder\n    repeat with I from 1 to count of the_subfolders\n        set name of every file of item I of the_subfolders to the_folder_name & \"_\" & I & \".pdf\"\n        move every file of item I of the_subfolders to the_folder\n    end repeat\n    --\n    -- optionally delete the subfolders\n    delete every folder in the_folder -- put two dashes in front of this line to comment it out\nend tell\n\nHere are screenshots showing you how it works. You should practice on a set of folders that don't matter at first. You can see my starting set-up in the first picture and the result in the second. The captions on the pictures are not showing up (for me) so here is what they should be:\nPicture 1: Automator Service, with slightly modified AppleScript.\nPicture 2: folder_1, folder_2, folder_3, folder_4, and folder_5 each have a single pdf in them. Only folder_1's contents are shown here.\nPicture 3: This is the result. The subfolders are gone. The files are named after the parent folder.\nYou can save the script as an app. Or, you can run the script within a step in Automator since Automator can run an AppleScript. That's in the Utilities section of Automator, \"Run AppleScript.\" I would include a picture but I am new here and am only allowed two pictures until I am upgraded.\nIf you want to do it with a service, you use almost the same script, but you have to pass the control-clicked folder. Rather than using the AppleScript step \"Choose Folder\" you tell your Automator Service to \"receive selected folder in the Finder\" and you set \"the_folder\" to item 1 of the input. See the first picture. Works like a champ here!\n\n\n\n", "Q: Windows 7 Client to OSX Server 5 (Password Error) I have OSX Server 5.0.15 running and am having trouble getting Windows 7 clients to connect to share via SMB.

This question is just for curiosity.\nMy UK Macbook Pro's keyboard has a key in the very top left with the symbols § and ±. (On a US keyboard the ~/` key is in this position.) From looking at pictures of the newest Macbook Pros, it seems this key has finally been phased out, but I'm still curious about the reason for its existence up to now.\nLet me say at the outset, I'm looking for answers based on specific known facts about the reason for the key's inclusion, which probably means either some insider insight into Apple's decision making, or at least some knowledge of the history behind it. A lot of answers so far are based on opinions or speculations, and it would be greatly appreciated if that could be avoided.\nThe symbols on the key, § and ±, seem quite obscure and rarely used. § is an old-fashioned symbol for a section heading in a document, and is still used in the printing industry, while ± is used to quantify errors in scientific and engineering documents, as well as in high-school maths (i.e. the quadratic formula). But even in those specialised contexts the choice seems odd: why include a special key for the section marker § but not the much more common paragraph marker ¶? Similarly, why ± and not ≈, Δ or √?\nIt seems odd to have a dedicated key for these relatively obscure symbols, especially since it doesn't appear on the Apple US keyboard layout, or on a non-Apple UK keyboard.\nSo basically I'm just curious about the reason for this key's existence. It seems unlikely that British Mac users have a special reason to use these symbols often, so I would guess the reasons for including it were either historical or technical in nature, or possibly they had to do with one particular Apple employee's personal preference. But what, specifically, were those reasons?\nAs noted above, I'm looking for answers with specific insight or evidence about the decision-making at Apple regarding the existence of this particular key.\n\nA: I think only Apple knows the answer to this.  \nThe § and ± characters are available on the US keyboard at option 6 and option-shift =.\nI believe a historical antecedent for the ± key can be found in the IBM Selectric 3 keyboard.\nOther Apple hardware keyboards with the same key in the same place are Arabic, Bulgarian, Czech, Dutch, English International, Greek, Hebrew, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, and Turkish.  I suspect their users also wonder why Apple gave these two characters such status.\nA much bigger mystery in my view is why the Apple British keyboard puts the \" and @ characters at different places than any normal British keyboard does.  Apple eventually had to provide a \"British PC\" option in system preferences/keyboard/input sources to accommodate all the folks who are used to the British standard.\n\nA: The Apple UK keyboard is technically not a UK keyboard.\nThe UK keyboard is defined by the British Standard BS 4822:19941 which Apple doesn't conform to completely.   While it would be beneficial to post directly from this standard, it currently costs £98 or about $130USD which makes it cost prohibitive to source this for this answer.\n\nApple UK vs. Standard UK\nThere are notable differences between the two keyboards besides the key in question.  The € (Euro) symbol as well as the placement of the AltGr 2 key at the bottom where the left Command key would be.\nThe standards compliant UK keyboard:\n\nApple UK Keyboard:\n\nWhat the Symbols Mean\nThe UK standard Keyboard has a ¬ (negation) symbol where Apple has the § (section) symbol and of course, the US has the ~ (tilde) which is also used to denote negation.\n\nThe negation of a proposition p is notated in different ways in\nvarious contexts of discussion and fields of application. Among these\nvariants are the following:\n\n\nIt's conceivable that the US opted for the ~ symbol rather than the traditional ¬ symbol because it not only meant negation, it had a wider range of uses (i.e. \"approximately\").  Also keep in mind that both the US and the UK keyboard retain the backtick (`) symbol on the same key.\nWhy the § Symbol?\nOnly Apple will know for sure why they chose to \"Think Different\" when they steered from the US and UK's choice for a negation symbol and go with something completely different.  However, it's not outside the realm of possibility that market research told them nobody knew what ¬ meant and to put something that made more sense to people purchasing their products.\n\n1 BS 4822:1994 was deprecated in July 2014 for ISO/IEC TR 15440:2016.\n2 Wikipedia:  AltGr is a modifier key found on some computer keyboards and is primarily used to type characters that are unusual for the locale of the keyboard layout, such as currency symbols and accented letters.\n\nA: Irresistible to first answer the question in the title:\nIt is used for entering characters that are shaped like this § and ± as defined in unicode  U+00A7 for section-sign and  U+00B1 for plus-minus sign.\nThen more seriously: \nKeyboard layouts are for a very large part historically grown and evolved. \nBritish needs are a bit different than American needs. Americans most often only need the old Peso symbol $ and while £ is most often needed in insular designs the still close relationship with the continent also requires the €-sign. All those keys have to be placed somewhere and somehow shifted around among a limited number of available keys according to local demand. \nThat need seems high enough for other layouts to opt for a section sign in said place (Finnish SFS 5966,  Hungarian, Dutch and then some.)\nThe British Standard BS 4822 is old and small and it, as well as the international ISO, only defines non-binding recommendations just like the German DIN 2112  and 2137 (which dropped the requirement for a very special Shift 5 a while ago). Apparently there are at least three keyboard layouts for Macs available for (British) English users, two of them with the marked as unusual § position (UK and US-International) all differing from one another and the PC standard.\nBefore the world settled mainly on the two blocks for computer input of Wintel vs Apple there were even more keyboard layouts around, often differing in very peculiar ways. Since Apple has a keyboard layout tradition that dates back to before the IBM PC they were on a different path of dependencies. Although Apple's earliest attempts on the European market did not include such a sign.\nDepending on intended usage one layout has advantages and disadvantages over the other. English speaking programmers have different needs than French novelists or German lawyers.\nWho needs the plus or minus sign?\nThe plus-minus sign is not that specialised as the OP's question implies:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*In mathematics, it generally indicates a choice of exactly two possible values, one of which is the negation of the other.\n  \n*In experimental sciences, the sign commonly indicates the confidence interval or error in a measurement, often the standard deviation or\n  standard error. The sign may also represent an inclusive range of\n  values that a reading might have.\n  \n*In engineering the sign indicates the tolerance, which is the range of values that are considered to be acceptable, safe, or which comply\n  with some standard, or with a contract.\n  \n*In botany it is used in morphological descriptions to notate \"more or less\".\n  \n*In chemistry the sign is used to indicate a racemic mixture.\n  \n*In chess, the sign indicates a clear advantage for the white player; the complementary sign ∓ indicates the same advantage for the black\n  player.\n  \n\nEspecially users in science and engineering seem likely to request a more prominent placement or reachability, whereas statistics also imply government actors with wants that might signify demand for that character. All these simultaneously form an important group with quite a big say on the formulation of said standards or specialty layouts.\nWho is in need of a section sign? \nThe paragraph sign ¶ is indeed very rarely seen if you turn off \"show invisibles\" in your preferred editor. Confusingly, the German name of § is also \"Paragraphenzeichen\" as well as paragraph sign in Canon Law.\nUsage of especially the section sign is still very common in law and governance (the biggest customers often restricted to using standardised tools) but also writers of novels and quite a bit of non-fiction. Especially theologians still cling to a very unsightly tradition to use it throughout their books (quite recent example).  \nSince usage of said sign in British publications is indeed quite uncommon there are not much explanations left.\nIn short: historical path dependencies, local needs at the time of standardisation are the general, main reasons; Apple engineers deciding this might be a good idea the other.\n\nA: Mine has the same design, which made me wonder the same thing.I don't know the answer for why [± and §] button is really positioned there, but I can speculate why [` and ~] is not there.\nAnd it would be because this design favors users, especially the ones that only use the keyboard (ex. developers using Vim, Emacs or similar) to access the ` and ~ symbols without taking their hands off the keyboard or moving them too much, which helps for more effective usage of the keyboard and reduce fatigue and strain on the hands and fingers, as users can maintain a more natural and comfortable typing position.\nBut of course this is only my speculation.\n\nA: The § ± key on a UK Mac keyboard is useless and moreover a waste of room and efficiency for a keyboard. For me it is an historical error made by people who weren't real users of keyboards in an international context or in a programming context.\nTo add these 2 rare symbols on at least 2 ≠ keyboards (Great Britain (B), English International (Z)), Apple chose to reduce the size of 3 very useful keys:\nleft shift,right shift and return thus causing a lot of typing errors to users of these 2 keyboards, most notably with the key on the left side of the return key: \\ |.\nWorking in an international environment of students, engineers and researchers coming from many ≠ countries I always advised them to use the\n\"US english\" Apple keyboard characterised by ` ~ in the upper left corner,\n\\ | between the delete and the return\nbecause they will make much less typing errors and will be able to type nearly all europeans special characters with very easy to remember alt sequences.\nAnd all the punctuation characters will be accessible through simple key use: ,, . and ;, all programming ones with shift key.\nMost of them were sold an \"International English\" which Apple thought was the best fit, but they all were returned back to Apple to be exchanged for an\n\"US english\".\nExamples:\n§ = alt+6\n± = alt++\n° = alt+0\n≠ = alt+=\nå = alt+a\né = alt+e, e\nÉ = alt+e, E\nè = alt+`, e\nÈ = alt+`, E\nî = alt+i, i\nø = alt+o\nü = alt+u, u\nß = alt+s\nç = alt+c\nñ = alt+n, n\n", "Q: Usage problem with my iPad Air I have an iPad Air and I want to update this game that needs 1.4 GB.

I don't know how to fix this, I've restarted my iPad but it didn't work. I don't know where the other 8 GB is coming from. I also have the same problem on my iPhone 4s.\n\nA: First, you should update your iPad to the latest iOS system and then if it still takes up you much space, I guess maybe there is much junk files or \"other\" storage on your iPad Air. You should know what is the Other storage clearly firstly. There are just too many things that require physical storage. That's why Apple chose to lump a lot of things into the \"Other\" category.

I know how to open it in Finder:\nopen .\n\nBut, how can I open it in ForkLift?\n\nA: Use following command:\nopen -a ForkLift .\n\n\nA: A little bit late to the party, anyway it's worth of better description, so here you are. Keep in mind that this answer is based on the RED's one-liner, just with some (little bit mooo...oore details ;) )\nRaw command line execution\nUse the following command to open the current folder (in this case, the dot represents the pwd command):\nopen -a ForkLift .\n\n#or the same\nopen -a ForkLift `pwd`\n\nor any other existing folder using absolute or relative path, i.e.:\n# Absolute path to Apache's logs\nopen -a ForkLift /var/log/apache2/\n\n# Relative path from home folder to `All Them Witches` within `Music` folder.\nopen -a ForkLift ~/Music/All\\ Them\\ Witches\n\n# Relative from current position, ie while you're already in `~/Music` folder\nopen -a ForkLift All\\ Them\\ Witches\n\n#or \nopen -a ForkLift \"All Them Witches\"\n\nWhat the open command does?\nCheck yourself in terminal with man open ;) It just opens a file or directory with default application for file type. So as you already know open . opens the current folder in the Finder, but for an instance open foo.txt will (try to) open the file in the default text editor, open foo.psd in Adobe Photoshop, generic graphic files, like open foo.jpg or open foo.png in the Macos Preview, etc.\nThe -a parameter for open command\nIndicates which application we want to force instead of default one, the pseudo-schema would look like:\nopen <with-my-preferd-app> <file or directory>\n\nso pseudo-explain of the RED's open -a ForkLift . is exactly\nopen <with ForkLift app in /Applications folder> <current directory>\n\nFinally, you can use it as reference to application within Aplication folder (no need to add *.app ext then) like:\nopen -a Sublime\\ Text foo\\ file.txt\n\n#or (other handling of spaces in app and/or file name(s))\nopen -a \"Sublime Text\" \"foo file.txt\"\n\n#or (by specyfing its full, absolute path)\nopen -a /Applications/Sublime\\ Text.app ~/Documents/foo\\ file.txt\n\nor to another app (i.e. your custom editor you wrote) in other folder than /Applications like:\nopen -a /full/path/to/YourOwnEditor.app bar.txt\n\nAlias(es)\nBack to the ForkLift, of course, you can add an alias to your ~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc (depending on used shell) to replace open -a Forklift with simple forklift (or any other alias you want), like this (trailing space placed intentionally (please see below section Clarification about trailing space in alias(es)!):\nalias forklift='open -a Forklift '\n\nto open folders in FL with:\n# current dir\nforklift .\n\n# or the same\nforklift `pwd`\n\n#or folder relative to your home\nfoklift ~/Music/All\\ Them\\ Witches\n\n#or absolute path\nfoklift /Users/whitesiroi/Music/All\\ Them\\ Witches\n\netc, etc...\nFinally following this you can add several other aliases, to open files in different editors/apps (if they are installed in your system ofc),\n# Console in older Macos\nalias console='open -a \"/Applications/Utilities/Console.app\" '\n\n# Console in newer Macos\nalias console='open -a \"/System/Applications/Utilities/Console.app\" '\n\n# Sublime Text (if installed)\nalias subl='open -a \"Sublime Text\" '\n\n# GitHub Atom (if installed)\nalias atom='open -a Atom '\n\n# etc...\n\nRe-load!\nDon't forget to re-load your profile file after adding/modyfing/removing aliases, depending on which shell you're workin', source your profile file i.e.:\n# . at the beginning is a system alias for `source` command here\n. ~/.zshrc\n\n# so you can use it also like\nsource ~/.zshrc\n\n# or the same for ~/.bashrc\n\nthen just run alias command without parameters, to check if your changes are taken into account.\nOptionally, instead of sourcing, you can just reset your session (close and re-open, here it comes comfortable to configure in iTerm Profile(s) for most common sessions you work every day) or create a new one.\nClarification about trailing space in alias(es):\nNote, that trailing space in aliases is not mandatory, also sometimes may not work as expected, everything depends on what does your alias do.

The reason behind this is so that the shell doesn't have to actually search for it each time it needs to execute it.\nSee: http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html#Command-Search-and-Execution\nTo force bash to re-hash the table, use 'hash -r' .\n\nA: It sounds like you need to link\n/Users/myUserName/.nvm/v5.8.0/lib/node_modules/phonegap\nto\n/usr/local/bin/phonegap\nStep 1\nIn terminal, run \nls -l /usr/local/bin/phonegap\n\nYou'll probably see something like:\nlrwxr-xr-x 1 jsmith wheel 36 Mar 26 12:05 /usr/local/bin/phonegap -> /some/other/path/to/phonegap\n\nIf it starts with a lowercase L then it is a link. It's probably pointing to a file that no longer exists, so you can remove it by going\nrm -f /usr/local/bin/phonegap\n\nPlease be careful with rm it means \"remove\" or \"delete\" and there is no undo.\nThen, you will need to make a new link from the existing phonegap to the place where it is expected to be:\nln -s /Users/myUserName/.nvm/v5.8.0/lib/node_modules/phonegap /usr/local/bin/phonegap\n\nYou do not want to add /Users/myUserName/.nvm/v5.8.0/lib/node_modules/ to your $PATH because that will eventually change. That's the whole reason to link them to a static path like /usr/local/bin/.\nNote: you may need to add sudo before those commands, if you get some sort of permissions error.\n(Also, sorry about the pandoc reference earlier.

It is .tex file of some hundreds of lines. \nI had it in BitTorrentSync but it does not store old versions. \nThis complication was caused either by TextMate 2beta when running compilation in non-TeX document; BitTorrentSync (has been unstable in 2.x but weak evidence). The file got empty with 50kB total size as a complication. \nIn the compilation, I had in place the option --shell-escape with XeLaTeX which allows to run Python inside LaTeX document. \nView\nIn TextMate, you see the corrupted file\n\nIn doing vim file.tex, I see corrupted file\nLast login: Wed Apr  6 21:41:50 on ttys000\n\nMacBook-Air-3:~ masi$ vim   /Users/masi/BitTorrentSync/diseases/1.4.2016.tex \n\nClinical infectious disease - David Sch...\nMandel    \n\nHerpes virus infection % = Herpesviridae\n\\begin{itemize}\n\"~/BitTorrentSync/InfectiousDiseases/1.4.2016.tex\" 1909L, 50380C\n\nwhich indicates that something has went very bad wrong, most probably in the compilation of TextMate. \n\nHow to Restore an Old Version of a File in El Capitan?\n\nA: No success in restoring the file, like patrix points out. \nSo regular daily backups is the way to go to prevent loss of data. \nHowever, this cannot only be the measure in the long-run. \nWe need to understand why such an occasion occurs. \nSuggestion for improvements in Text Editor, Python and LaTeX\nI think the reason for the corruption of the file was the shebang --shell-escape inside TextMate but also because of LaTeX community. There are many other tickets in TextMate which should be fixed so this one is not in the high list. So I just do not use \"always\" the shebang for Python because of the danger of losing data.\nWe should\n\n\n*\n\n*understand how to limit the rights of --shell-escape\n\n*understand how to have Python in inside LaTeX without full shell rights\n\n*much more error tests are needed for tracking down this error\n\n*active text editor development with open/community development\n\n\nI think this is not only the editor' fault. I think this is also LaTeX community task because they allow in the first place python in the .tex document with too wide permissions. \nI think the current method should be better implemented because of such damages. \nI think we need pythonLatex or something else because importing whole python in LaTeX is dangerous currently without Unit tests. \n\n\n*\n\n*I propose Unit tests for LaTeX documents.

The other day I was surprised to have to remember my restrictions passcode when reseting my iPhone. What are all the difference passwords and passcode needed to fully setup an iOS device?

It requires hacking the firmware & needs re-hacking at each update -\nThese guides from MacRumors are as good as they get, one for Yosemite & another for El Capitan.\nWorth it?\nThe 1,1 & 2,1 are really end-of-life & now very slow compared to a 'modern' machine.\nI really guess it depends on your budget, but you can get an absolute top-flight 5,1 [or the smart money goes on a 4,1 with the Apple upgrade kit] with two 6-core hyperthreading Xeons @3.46GHz & 64GB RAM for under £1800 in the UK. Your existing drives will just carry over [though idk about the OS itself, mine did from a 3,1 to 5,1].\nThe Geekbench scores on those are about 32k, that's slightly under the current top model 'trash-can' at 33k. I just checked the score for the 2.66 Mac Pro, 6k.\nI took the latter path, even though I was only moving up from a 3,1 - which is now in the hands of my partner & very happily running El Capitan. I wanted a speed boost & the upgraded 4,1 was right on the money for me.\n\nA: You can, but you'll have security issues.\nTo go beyond Lion (10.7)  on a 2007 Mac Pro 2,1, you will need to install an aftermarket \"hack\" EFI update.\nThen, you can install either Yosemite (10.10) or El Capitan (10.11).  Between the two, you are better off installing El Cap, as it is better supported by Apple, with better security features particularly where browsers are concerned.  With a RAM limit of 16GB (32GB in some cases), you can certainly accommodate the OS.\nOnce you install that EFI update, use great caution installing Security Update 2018-001 or later, as there are reports of that breaking the EFI update.  This is probably worth \"playing with\" using an external drive to do test installs of the OS.\nAssuming cost is no object, your best option is a brand new Mac.\n", "Q: How to fix a frayed cable on a MagSafe Power Adapter?

My friend's iphone keeps forgetting one of its iMessage addresses. Both the phone number and her email address are configured for iMessage but often the phone doesn't receive messages if they are sent to the email address. This often happens if she sends me message from the Messages app on her mac and I reply on my mac. Then she expects a reply on her phone but doesn't get it.

I guess I could just delete her email address from her Contacts card but I don't really want to do that and it might not work anyway.\n\nA: Tell your friend to go to Settings > Messages > Send & Receive.\nBy turning on the setting to receive from all of the email addresses, it shouldn't matter which address you send to. Your friend can also choose the phone to be their \"Caller-ID\" so they are sending as a mobile and not an email/AppleID.\nYou can also be sure to delete any conversations that aren't to the phone number so you reuse a thread to the cell as opposed to the email. \n", "Q: Burning CD images to Bootable USB Why can I copy a Linux ISO directly to a USB using dd, but in order to make a bootable USB using a FAT32 filesystem I need to convert the ISO to an UDRW image? \n\nA: The Windows iso image needs to be converted to a Read/Write format so the \"Boot Camp Support Software\" can be added to the USB flash drive.\nSay, for Example, you wanted to use the Boot Camp Assistant to create a USB flash drive for the purposes of installing Windows 7.

I partitioned the SSD 6 times and I lost my OS X partition and Windows partition. Someone helped me and I made the disk single-partition again and found all my files. \nBOOTCAMP partition looks like this:\n\n\nA: You have not actually installed Windows. Your image shows the BOOTCAMP partition is MS-DOS (FAT) formatted. If Windows installed, the partition would be NTFS formatted.\nAt some point during the installation, did you tell Windows to format the BOOTCAMP partition? See step 4 here and \"Format the Windows partition\" step here. If you skip this step, you will get the following message:\n\nThe Boot Camp Assistant creates the partition to install Windows. The format is MS-DOS (FAT) and the label is BOOTCAMP. In the Windows installer, you must reformat this partition. When you do this, the format will be NTFS and the BOOTCAMP label will be removed. If you watch carefully, you will see this happen. After Windows installs, the Boot Camp Support Software is executed. This will rename the Windows partition back to BOOTCAMP.

You can do this by one of two ways:\nMethod 1: Create an Apple ID using Gmail, Outlook, etc:\nIf you want to create an Apple ID, but don't want to have to restore the phone to do it, visit the Apple ID management page. Note: your daughter will need an existing email address to do this. Follow the onscreen instructions to create the new ID using the existing email.\nMethod 2: Create an Apple ID by restoring the phone:\nIf you want an email address ending in @icloud.com, then you have to reset the phone by navigating to General > Reset > Reset all Content and Settings and confirming the prompts onscreen.

I am talking 10+ GB here and more than 10,000 Emails. I am using Mac OS X 10.6.8. It is a slow process, which is to be expected. It happens what is supposed to happen: Emails vanish in local folder and appear in imap folder.\nWhat happens that I do not get is that HDD space decreases considerably during the process (approximately the same amount of GB I move) and stay down temporarily but for a considerable amount of time (several hours). Theoretically I am supposed to have around 9 GB of free space on my hard disk which went down all the way to zero and has in several hours recovered only to 2.5 GB again and goes up only very very slowly.\nMy guess is that this is what is suppose to happen in the process, but I would be interested in what exactly is happening here. Why does it take up such large amounts of space to move emails and why does it take so long afterwards until HDD space becomes available again?\nThanks.\nEdit: Looks like I was mistaken. Space is not recovering. With \"Get account info\" I see that I moved 8.6 GB to the IMAP Mailbox. At the same time I deleted about 2 GB of files on my system to free up space. With the initial 9 GB I had free on my system I should be at 11 GB. So in fact I actually lose the same amount of space on my system like the emails I moved, since I am now down to about 2GB. But the mails in the local folder are deleted, so normally the space should have been freed up! This does not make any kind of sense to me!\n\nA: My hypothesis is that what you observe is happening because you are setting your IMAP account not to have all the message for offline consumption, but only headers. If you had it set to full messages, you would be decreasing your space even more, because the IMAP metadata needs to be kept in a database, apart from the full messages.\n", "Q: I broke sudo - how do I fix it?

How do I give myself access to sudo again? And is this a common problem?\n\nA: Looks like it only co-incidentally appeared at the 10.11.4 update; the problem was actually when I installed vagrant. Somewhere along the line either I or a script I used overwrote /etc/sudoers with the following rather than appending it:\nCmnd_Alias VAGRANT_EXPORTS_ADD = /usr/bin/tee -a /etc/exports\nCmnd_Alias VAGRANT_NFSD = /sbin/nfsd restart\nCmnd_Alias VAGRANT_EXPORTS_REMOVE = /usr/bin/sed -E -e /*/ d -ibak /etc/exports\n%admin ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: VAGRANT_EXPORTS_ADD, VAGRANT_NFSD, VAGRANT_EXPORTS_REMOVE\n\nSo /etc/sudoers was toast.

Is there something special about the Apple EarPod cable? Or does the iPhone do something even cooler?\n\nA: An line-level input, which is what your car's aux in jack is, presents a relatively high impedance to the source - generally 10k ohms.

Disclaimer: I'm not sure whether or not this belongs in Ask Different or security.stackexchange.com, but I'm using a .dmg and Disk Utility, so I'll put it here. End of disclaimer.\nThe title says most of it. I created an encrypted .dmg in Disk Utility and I'm wondering: if I copy a file to it, is the file automatically encrypted and locked under the .dmg?\n\nA: It depends on your viewpoint: a file written to an encrypted disk image is immediately written encrypted to the HDD/SSD where the disk image resides.\nSince the file system of the unlocked disk image is still mounted, the file appears as \"unencrypted\".\nSo a user, who can access the raw HDD/SSD only, can't read/decode the file content, but a user with the proper permissions/rights to access the whole file system (including the mounted/unlocked  disk image) still can read the file.\n\nYou can test this yourself: Create an encrypted, normal writeable image.dmg as user1 in the root of your file system with 777 permissions and owner user1:staff. Now mount the image as user1 and add a file with some known content (e.g. a text file containing \"stackexchange\"). The file system of the encrypted disk is mounted to /Volumes with 700 permissions (only user1 can read/write).\nSwitch to user2 with the image file being still mounted and open/read the file image.dmg with a hex editor - though you probably see the mounted image on your desktop, you can't access it due to missing permissions.

Now I would like to know if I should also install antivirus on Windows 10, or is all virus protection handled by the Mac?\n\nA: Of course, installing an antivirus on your Windows is recommended, but it is not a necessity. Generally, if there was a virus, your mac would not be damaged, as the OS X file format is read only on Windows AFAIK (unless the virus was so well made, that it bypassed this).\n\nor is all virus protection handled by the Mac?\n\nThere is no way for that to happen as when you run Windows with BootCamp, then Mac is not even running, and only mounted as a read-only format on Windows. It is almost like running 2 different systems.\n\nA: Windows and Mac actually different OS run, so Mac can't handle all service on Windows. \nVirus can run in Windows systems in virtual or native install. So you need install Antivirus on Windows systems.\nHopefully that's answer your questions.\n", "Q: iTunes Backup security code not working I have a backup of my iPhone 5 on my computer and I had a security code that I know I used but as I just got a new iPhone 6S, the backup is not working as it is stating the security number I am putting in is wrong so is there a way around this or a way to reset the code of the backup that I no longer have the phone?

I downloaded OSX El Capitan in one Mac, then I copied installation files (.app) to shared ftp folder. In another Macs It doesn't start. Is it for security? Can I do that?

Behind the scene .app files are really just folders which are treated as a single file by the OS. My guess is that you either have an incomplete file or something has gone wrong when you copied the file to the ftp server. \nIf you compress the .app (control+click > Compress \"Install OS X El Capitan\") and then copy the resulting archive to the ftp folder your other macs will be able to download the archive, uncompress it and run the app.\nOr you can just copy Install OS X El Capitan.app to a USB drive or even create a bootable USB drive which you can then use as a rescue installation drive.\n", "Q: contact info sent on a text that is now blocked If someone blocks my texts but has previously sent me contact info from their address book, can I access the info if my texts are being blocked?\n\nA: As long as your device received the info before the block happened, then the answer is yes.\n", "Q: View and delete individual messages directly from POP server in OS X Mail There is/was a feature in OS X Mail that allowed to fetch the list of messages from the server in a configured POP account.

Heat, moisture, etc. are not good for any screen. \nam I just paranoid with my new toy?\nNope! Enjoy your new Apple Device!\n", "Q: Notification from FaceTime won't disappear! I have a notification on my MacBook that won't disappear.\nMy FaceTime app has a notification that wont disappear without me going into settings and clicking the badge icon. I want to delete the notification, not disable the badge icon, yet nothing works.\nI've tried deleting all the recent and missed calls on my app and restarting it. It's not found in the Notification Center on the right (which opens when you click the 3 bars icon in the top right corner of the Menu Bar).\nWhat do I do? \n\nA: What fixed it for me was to open up FaceTime and simply Quit out of it.\n\nA: This usually (not always) happens when there is still a missed call somewhere.  See if this helps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to FaceTime → Preferences\n\n*Uncheck the box ‘Calls from this phone’\n\n*Ensure that only the correct phone number is listed there (and not some other family member)\n\n*Close Preferences and delete any Audio or Video calls listed on the left side\nSometimes there's missed Audio calls and that causes the badge to appear.\n\nA: I've found say of clearing the badge by updating the database backing FaceTime on the Mac. This detailed blog post I wrote  detailing the steps.\nIn essence, there is an SQLite db in ~/Library/Application Support/CallHistoryDB, with a table called ZCALLRECORD which holds the read state, from which the badge is generated. The column name is ZREAD. Updating the value in this column to 1, followed by a logout and login, should clear the badge. \n\nA: This happened to me when I received a call from my phone. The notification appeared on my computer, but I canceled the call from my phone. This is how I got rid of the tenacious notification:\n\n\n*\n\n*Quit FaceTime app\n\n*Open Terminal (⌘ + Spacebar and type 'Terminal')\n\n*Run this command: killall NotificationCenter\nShould do the trick!\n", "Q: Recursively remove all invalid characters from text files in place I have several thousand text files, some of which contain invalid UTF-8 characters. I want to recursively remove all invalid characters from these files in place.\nI am aware that many similar questions have been asked before, such as: how to remove non UTF-8 characters from text file but I have not found one that is both recursive and operates in place.\n\nA: The great thing about UNIX commands is that you can combine them together. iconv doesn't know how to recurse into directories, but find does. It can call iconv on every file it sees.\n(These commands will convert all files in the current directory and all directories within. Make sure you are in the directory you want to convert all files in recursively.)\nTo change all files with the extension .txt:\nfind . -type f -name '*.txt' -print0 | \n    while IFS= read -r -d $'\\0' filename; do \n        iconv -f utf-8 -t utf-8 -c \"$filename\" > \"$filename\".iconv_cleaned_utf8\n        mv \"$filename\".iconv_cleaned_utf8 \"$filename\"\n    done\n\nI suppose this code requires some explanation. What it does is:\n\n\n*\n\n*find prints out all the filenames of the files involved, separated by a null byte (the null byte is the only invalid character for a file path)\n\n*bash reads the filenames and loops through them\n\n*iconv converts the file to a tempfile with an extra extension\n\n*we mv the tempfile to replace the original file.\n\n\nIf they have different extensions (this is for any and all files under the current directory), remove the -name *.txt\nIt's a bit cleaner if you have the sponge utility from moreutils, but that is not installed by default.\nfind . -type f -name '*.txt' -print0 | \n    while IFS= read -r -d $'\\0' filename; do \n        iconv -f utf-8 -t utf-8 -c \"$filename\" | sponge \"$filename\"\n    done\n\n\nA: This may not answer the whole question but I have been a happy user of BBEdit for quite a number of years (Pre-OSX at least...). I use it for HTML hacking and occasional opening of files that I can't figure out.\nIt has this nice feature called Zap Gremlins, which basically removes a whole bunch of strange and non-ASCII characters from any file. Which sounds a lot like what you need to do.\nAND it is massively scriptable, but not free. It may be worth investigating to see if it will do what you want.\n", "Q: Jailbreak Detection in Apple Profile Manager Am I able to detect if a phone has been jailbroken if it is managed/supervised by Apple Profile Manager?\n\nA: Profile Manager isn't an MDM that reports details about app install which is usually used to determine jailbreak status. (i.e. If cydia app and other apps are installed, it's a good conclusion that the device has been jailbroken.) \nAlso, once jailbroken, it's entirely possible the device won't report back the correct information depending on what else is modified past the initial compromise of device security.\n", "Q: File extension not hiding I have a .dmg file and I want to hide its extension. So I do the usual and ⌘I, then check Hide extension. killall Finder just to be sure. I look and sure enough... the file extension is still there. So I use SetFile -a E myfile.dmg hoping that will work. It doesn't. Any ideas? Here's a picture just in case.\n\nA: OK, I found the issue. Apparently two options have to be set in order for any extension to disappear (except for .app). First you have to go into Finder's Preferences > Advanced. Untick Show all filename extensions. Then you tick Hide extension in the Get Info window for your file and the extension is hidden.\n\nA: That's the \"get info\" window and not the Finder. The get info window will (in my experience) always show the extension.\nHiding the extension is for Finder views not the get info window.\n\nA: Try just doing the basic thing by pressing enter and deleting the extension. The press get info to make sure the extension is still there.\nWorks on 10.11.4\nTested on OSX El Capitan 10.11.4 \n\n", "Q: Making a FaceTime Audio call using AppleScript I have read through Make a FaceTime call using AppleScript, but the provided solution is for starting a video call. I am wondering if that solution can be adapted to make a FaceTime Audio call (and by extension, maybe even a call via iPhone utilizing Continuity).\n\nA: I found it!\nI tried many different combinations, such as facetimeaudio://[phonenumber] and facetime://audio/[phonenumber], but nothing worked. I was starting to think that there wasn't a way to do this.\nHowever, today, I decided to take another crack at it with some different combos, and this one works: facetime-audio://[phonenumber].\n", "Q: Command-line tool to ask remote server for current date-time On Mac OS X (such as 10.8 thru 10.11) is there a bundled command-line tool to ask a specific remote NTP time server for the current date-time?\nI found ntpdc but this queries the ntpd utility which I assume means going through my already-defined NTP servers. I want to make a call outside of my pre-defined NTP servers.\nLike this imaginary line where -s means server-address:\nntpclient -s time.euro.apple.com current\n\n\nA: You can use sntp as standard query tool for either NTP or SNTP servers.

However, the Mercedes model / year may not support music playback. \nAs @tyson mentioned, inquire with the car manual for Bluetooth settings \n\nA: There are various Bluetooth profiles available as documented here.  The various profiles enable only certain functions.\nIt maybe that your car needs to be paired more than once.  The Bluetooth profile that handlers music is likely A2DP, whereas the other functions are likely handled by HFP or HID.\nCheck the manual for your in car audio system and see if it's paired in all modes.   \nFor example, I have a Toyota, and when setting up s new device there are effectively two pairings, each handles certain audio functions.\n\nA: Sometimes, the car Bluetooth will bug out/glitch and will not pair correctly with the phone speaker. I have a Toyota and it bugs out very often. I will have to fix the music not working by turning off the engine and turning it on again. Sometimes pairing it again will work also.

Then I can create a mailbox called \"9AM\", place emails inside there, and with a little help from cron/iCal, have all those emails send at 9am each day allowing me to type emails late at night but have them send in the morning.\nMy code below however fails on the send command. \ntell application \"Mail\"\n    repeat with theMessage in (every message of (mailbox \"9AM\" of account \"accountnamehere\"))\n        send theMessage\n    end repeat\nend tell\n\nI also tried moving them to the \"Outbox\" mailbox but that just seems to make them disappear...\ntell application \"Mail\"\n    repeat with theMessage in (every message of (mailbox \"9AM\" of account \"accountnamehere\"))\n        set mailbox of theMessage to mailbox \"Outbox\"\n    end repeat\nend tell\n\nAny suggestions anyone? Help greatly appreciated!\nThis setup would be ideal as I can just leave a Mac switched on and then even save emails to this \"9AM\" mailbox from my iPhone. I hope it is possible.\n\nA: This is not necessarily meant to be a complete answer and is too much as a comment. Because the Mail AppleScript Dictionary lacks some verbs, e.g. send again, one therefore needs to workaround any shortcomings.\nThe code below could be incorporated into your script. It uses System Events to manipulate menu commands to send composed messages from the designated mailbox.\nExample Code:\ntell application \"Mail\"\n    activate\n    repeat with theMessage in (every message of (mailbox \"9AM\"))\n        open theMessage\n        delay 1\n        tell application \"System Events\" to click menu item \"Send Again\" of menu \"Message\" of menu bar 1 of process \"Mail\"\n        delay 1\n        tell application \"System Events\" to click menu item \"Send\" of menu \"Message\" of menu bar 1 of process \"Mail\"\n        delay 1\n    end repeat\nend tell\n\nWhat this does is automate the tasks that one could/would do manually to achieve the same results, sending the unsent saved messages from a given mailbox.\nWhat this doesn't do is, if the mailbox is other then Drafts, remove the messages from the target mailbox and additional coding will be required.\nNotes:\nThe problem with automating a series of manual tasks in this manner, aka. UI programming, is if at the designated time the script runs and you are doing something else and it take focus away from Mail then the script will not be able to properly complete.  This is because if the Mail menu is not visible then the calls being made by System Events cannot be completed.\nThe value of the delay command may need to be adjusted, e.g. delay 1.25, if required or whatever value works on your system.  Slower systems need higher delay values.\nObviously if the target mailbox is Drafts keep in mind that unless you code accordingly all messages in the target mailbox will be sent and therefore using e.g. \"9AM\" allows keeping drafts that aren't ready to send from being sent. The disadvantage of other then using Drafts is requiring additional coding to remove the messages that have now been sent via Send Again > Send in this manner.\n\nA: I stumbled upon this post, when I tried to do the same as you asked for.\nWell I wasn't that happy with the other solution, so I tried it on my own.\nI had no prior experience with Apple Script, but this is how i got it the sending of mails to work (check out the Solution chapter).\nSending mails\nThis works by copying the content of every mail in the given mailbox (in this case 8AM) and creating a new one with the same content. After sending the Mail, the one in the mailbox is deleted.

One needs it for testing the script on its own.\nTiming\nThe trickier part was the timing. The code snippet below should be seen as a starting point. It works, but there are some issues with it, which I explained further down.\nThis script gets the currentTime and compares it with the sendtime. When it is in the interval it calls the other script and sends the mail.\nCode:\non idle\n    set currentTime to current date\n    -- time when it should be executed (hour * 60 * 60 + min * 60)\n    -- here for 8:00 AM\n    set sendtime to (8 * 60 * 60 + 0 * 60)\n    \n    -- if it is between 8 and 8:05 send mails\n    if the time of currentTime is greater than sendtime and the time of currentTime is less than (sendtime + 300) then\n        \n        -- loading the script from the desktop, script in file \"send.scpt\"\n        set sendScript to load script (alias ((path to desktop folder as string) & \"send.scpt\"))\n        -- send Mails from the mailbox \"8AM\"\n        sendMail(\"8AM\") of sendScript\n    end if\n    \n    -- check every day\n    return 24 * 60 * 60\nend idle\n\nidle {}\n\nThe last line is optional.

It doesn't take much to wake up the mouse, and thereby wake up your computer.\n\nA: Try checking your Energy Saving settings in System Preferences. You can tell your Mac to wake up at a certain time from here. \nIf that does not solve the issue, you may benefit from resetting the System Management Controller. \nTo reset the SMC:\nTurn off and unplug the mac. Then, after waiting 15 seconds (the times are important), plug the mac back in. Finally, wait 5 seconds and power on the computer. The procedure may seem silly because it seems to only be a reboot, but this is how the SMC is reset. Good luck!\nAlso, here is Apple's support article on resetting the SMC: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201295\n", "Q: How do I input ^ instead of ˆ In my iMac 21.5-inch computer (OS X El Capitan Version 10.11.1) I have a cordless keyboard.\nAt the top of the key 6 I have ˆ instead of ^.\nThis is a problem.

You can plug the flash drive\ninto the USB port and restart with the alt/option key held down. To\ncreate the flash drive, you will need to download El Capitan from\nthe App Store. You do not reinstall El Capitan. Instead you use\nthe instruction given here to create the flash drive.\n\n*The other alternative would be to install rEFInd. During\nbooting you can select to enable/disable SIP. You would not have to\nactually install rEFInd to your internal disk. You can install rEFInd\nto a flash drive as well. See here for more information.\n\n\nThe advantage to the first method is the flash drive completely replaces your Recovery Partition. In other words, everything you can do once booted from the internal recovery partition will be available when booted from the flash drive. Of course, this requires downloading all of El Capitan which is several Gigabytes in size. If you have a slow internet connection speed, then the second method, involving installing rEFInd to a flash drive, would be a more favorable option.\n\nA: I use http://musings.silvertooth.us/2014/07/recovery-partition-creator-3-8/ to rewrite my recovery partition from el captian installation download from app store.\nThanks @David Anderson for good indication \n", "Q: How create an identical timestamp format as used in ppp.log file in a shell script? In the need to add custom logging messages to ppp.log, I see that the date and time are missing when outputting the command to >> /var/log/ppp.log. Other pppd related messages in ppp.log are prepended with a timestamp format that is similar to: \"Sat Apr  9 17:18:02 2016 : \". My goal is to output this exact date time format in a Mavericks shell script\nI know that other log files have different date/time timestamps. I want to re-create the format as used in ppp.log.\nRegression\nThis Mac OS X 10.9 environment is configured with a dutch language locale. Therefore $ echo $(date '+%a') returns \"za\" instead of the desired \"Sat\". That is the part that can be fixed by export LC_TIME=\"C\" or export LC_TIME=\"POSIX\". I have tried to read the date and pppd man page. However then there is still the abbreviated alphabetic timezone name CEST (the %Z part in $ date +%Z) in the output \"Sat Apr  9 18:12:12 CEST 2016\".\nI know I can create the format using all the different $ date format codes, like %a %b %e etcetera. Though I guess there is  a shorter way, isn't there?\n\nA: After a lot of searching, a search for \"date format without alphabetic time zone abbreviation\" returned Info on ISO 8601, the date and time representation standard.

Someone has my phone and they will eventually get my passcode and I NEED to reset it so they dont see everything thats on my phone but I don't want them to know that I reset it.\n\nA: When you send a remote erase, it's as if the device is new out of the box. The welcome screen is presented to the user.\nIf the device is activation locked, it will still be locked. If it's not locked, the person in possession of the device can set it up as they choose.\nNo record of the event is stored - so they may be able to assume you wiped it. If there was a passcode lock and they were guessing, it's not possible for them to know if they caused the erase or you did in all likelihood. If they didn't touch it, they could conclude it was buggy (unlikely) or wiped (likely).\n", "Q: Is there way to custom program an F key? I have an email address that is about 21 characters.  Is there way to program, say F15, to paste in the address?  This would be while in any app.\n\nA: I would use Spark to program the F15 key to do what you want. It is free (although donations are accepted). The website for Spark says \"Mac OS 10.9\" but I find it works with 10.11.4 here. \nHere is what Spark looks like on my Mac. You create a new hotkey from the File menu. In your case, you'll be making a new \"Keyboard\" type of hotkey. I am including a picture that shows what the new key would look like if your email address were the same as mine. You get to pick your own hotkey-- I picked Control-F12 because I don't have an F15 on my keyboard.\nThere are plenty of commercial hotkey apps that do more than Spark but \"free\" is nice and your needs will be met with it. See the link at the end of this answer.\nNote: I am not affiliated with Spark or its developers in any way. I have used the product on multiple machines for many years with great results so I am speaking first-hand about how it works. \n\n\nLink to shadowlab.org, where you can download Spark\n\nA: This is a simple way to do similar it uses text expansion.\nGo to System Preferences->Keyboard and choose the Text tab.\nThen hit + and enter a short form and the full email address.\nThen when you type the short form and a space Cocoa text spelling check will show you the full email address and replace the short form.\n", "Q: Not enough storage for El Capitan; no way to free up space I wanted to upgrade my Macbook 2008 from Yosemite to El Capitan.  Unfortunately, when I downloaded it and restarted my computer, on the \"select the disk on which to install\" page the only location, Macintosh HD, didn't have enough space (by about 2 GB).  It doesn't seem like there's a way to free up space from this startup menu, though.  I can open Disk Utility from this menu, and it seems logical to put some method of freeing up disk space from there, but if there is, I can't find it.\nIs there a way to get out of this startup menu so I can free up space, or a way to free up space directly from the menu?  This is pretty frustrating because it seems like a major design flaw if it tells you you don't have enough storage for a certain thing, but it doesn't let you free up the storage to download the thing.\nThere's already a question exactly like mine: Stuck in update boot (not enough disk space)\nBut no one has answered it, so I think it's okay to ask it again.\nEDIT: I can also access Terminal which I could potentially also use\nEDIT AGAIN: Nevermind, it looks like Macintosh HD is read-only while I'm in this boot menu.  At least terminal says \"read-only file system\" when I try to use rmdir on something.\n\nA: Boot to Recovery Mode (hold cmdR while booting). In the menubar open Utilities -> Terminal.\nNow change your working directory and go to /Volumes:\ncd /Volumes\n\nList all volumes:\nls -l\n\nMove to your main volume\ncd name_of_main_volume\n\nNow you can move forward to a directory to remove files and folders with cd folder_name.\nAppropriate paths to remove files or folders without touching your own data are:\n/Volumes/name_of_main_volume/cores\n/Volumes/name_of_main_volume/var/vm\n\nThen remove files with rm file_name or rm *.* after making sure you are in the proper directory with pwd and checking all files with ls -l.\nThe folder cores may be empty, vm usually contains a sleep image and/or swap files which are all disposable.\nIf this doesn't suffice go to your applications or your user folder and remove files/folders.\nTo remove a folder use rm -R folder_name. In this case application files (e.g. Maps.app) are also folders!\n\nA: So the same thing happened to me , and here is how I solved it. Go in the Recovery menu (hold cmd+r), in the top left corner, you should see the Apple logo.Click on it and select the boot disk, which should appear as your internal hard disk, you will be prompted to enter your password to decrypt it and you should be good to boot into your old system.\n\nA: I was installing El Capitan from Snow Leopard.  After taking a few hours to start installing, it popped up and said the installation failed, and to click restart to try again.  I clicked restart, and it restarted, then asked me what disk I wanted to install El Capitan on, and I picked Macintosh HD and it said not enough space - which surprised me, because I had checked before downloading El Capitan and starting the install that I definitely had enough space.  I think the partial install had taken up a lot of space.  I couldn't get back to my normal functioning Snow Leopard, every time I turned on the computer it would take me to the El Capitan install screen.\nAfter getting no help from Apple Support, who told me I was going to need to erase my hard drive, I started Googling and found this. Thanks to @klanomath for getting me started with a solution that worked.\n\n\n*\n\n*Turn off computer using the power button.  \n\n*Hold down command+R, click the power button, keep holding down command+R until the Apple logo appears, let go.  This starts recovery mode.\n\n*On the very top of the screen, went to Utilities>Terminal.\n\n\nThe goal was to find big files I could delete.\nTo get to your main disk, if it's called Macintosh HD.  The back slash you have to put before any spaces:\ncd /Volumes/Macintosh\\ HD/\n\nTo get list of everything in the folder you are in: ls -1\nTo get to my documents, use: cd /Volumes/Macintosh\\ HD/Users/username/Documents\nIf you need to, you can navigate around by doing: cd /Volumes/Macintosh\\ HD/ ls -1\nit shows you a list of folders, then get to the subfolder by either cd /Volumes/Macintosh\\ HD/Subfolder/ (typing full path)\nor cd ./Subfolder/ (shortcut where the . is wherever you are now).\nTo go up a folder use cd ...\nThen once you're in a subfolder with some files you're considering deleting, you can use the following to get a list with file sizes, so you can identify the big ones:\nls -lh\n\nAfter I navigated around a while and couldn't find many big files, I googled and found I could do the following to get a list of paths of all files bigger than 500 MB:\nfind / -size +500000 -print`\n\nThen I could re-navigate to them so that I could delete them. To delete a file use:\nrm filetodelete.ext\n\n(be careful you type the file name right, you don't want to accidentally delete other stuff, this can't be undone)\nTo check the directory you are currently in use pwd.\nI deleted some big video files I had and freed up several GB of space. Check the space with\ndf -h\n\nLook for Macintosh HD in the list (if that's the name of yours) and there should be some stats about % of space full, GB used vs. free, etc.\nThen, in the very top left of the screen, the picture of an Apple, I clicked that and clicked \"restart,\" my computer restarted, started the El Capitan install again, took forever, but actually finished!  And now I am happily running El Capitan and did not need to erase my hard drive.  I will be backing up some of my stuff now, lesson learned :)\n\nA: I found a solution for me (El Capitan MacBook Air), as the above did not work in my situation because all that I could acces through Terminal in recovery mode (what it brings you to as described above) are the Sierra installers (could not eject them, no Macintosh HD). So there was no way I could delete files to free up more space.  I spent a lot of time trying to get the Terminal solution to work.  \nFinally I called Apple and asked to be transferred to a higher tier supervisor.   She knew exactly where I was and suggested a simple fix:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Disk Utility from that main menu.  \n\n*Select your hard drive.  Not the name below, but the parent \"Apple SSD ****\" or whatever it's real name is.  \n\n*Select \"First Aid\".  \n\n*Once done, reboot.  \n\n\nIn my situation my reboot brought me right back, as if I just hit \"cancel\" on the update.

I tried looking this up but there are only examples for previous versions of iOS where there was an option in the podcast settings called \"mark all as played\".\nThis option is not there anymore. Is it gone forever?\n\nA: Marking all podcasts as played\nThis feature was originally removed sometime during iOS 7 (I think iOS 7.1, but am not certain on this).\nJust in case you're not aware, the closest option to doing this within the builtin Podcasts app is to do as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Launch the Podcasts app\n\n*Tap on My Podcasts\n\n*Tap on the Podcast series you want to mark as played\n\n*Tap on Edit (located at top right corner)\n\n*Now tap on the radio buttons on the left of each episode\n\n*Tap on the Mark option at bottom left\n\n*Select the Mark as Played option\n\n\nThis will mark all your selected podcasts as played.\nOf course, you can also use iTunes to mark them all as played and then sync your iPhone, but that may only be quicker overall if you wanted to mark multiple series of podcasts as played. Otherwise the above steps will most likely be more convenient - although certainly not as convenient as the older Mark all as Played option in earlier generations of iOS.\nGone forever?\nIn terms of whether this feature is gone forever, no-one here (or even at Apple) can answer that. There's no telling what may or may not happen with the Podcasts app in future.\nAlternatives\nFinally, there are a number of very popular third party podcast apps which many users have turned to. It may be worth you investigating some of these to see if they're suitable for your needs.

Also, though it would take very long, if the reward was great enough (like cracking a celebrity's or an executive of a rival company's iPhone), one could restore the backup on a same model iPhone running the same version of iOS, guess some passcodes until the iPhone erases itself (as a security measure, iPhones can be set to erase themselves after 10 failed passcode attempts) or the time penalty for incorrectly guessing becomes greater than the time it would to take to restore the backup, the cracker would just restore another backup and guess some more passcodes, eventually guessing the right one.\n", "Q: Paste stops working (\"CFPasteboardRef: Lock timeout\") Pasting from the clipboard stopped working on my Mac.

I recommend to do the same guys, if for some reason you have this issue.\n\nA: Sounds like this would solve this problem more simply:\nset dest to \"/Users/HOME/Desktop/PHOTOS-Albums/\" as POSIX file as text -- the destination folder (use a valid path) \n\ntell application \"Photos\"\n    activate\n    set l to name of albums\n    set albNames to choose from list l with prompt \"Select some albums\" with multiple selections allowed\n\n    if albNames is not false then -- not cancelled  \n        repeat with tName in albNames\n            set tFolder to dest & tName\n            my makeFolder(tFolder) -- create a folder named (the name of this album) in dest   \n            export (get media items of album tName) to (tFolder as alias) without using originals\n         end repeat\n    end if\nend tell\n\non makeFolder(tPath)\n    do shell script \"mkdir -p \" & quoted form of POSIX path of tPath\nend makeFolder\n\nAlthough I haven't tested it myself, it is a script to export selected albums into a folder structure in Finder with he album names as Folder names.\n\nA: It's already there in that form.  It's just a question of finding it, and then copying it.\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to your Pictures folder\n\n*In that find the Photos Library probably called \"Photos 3 Library\"\n\n*Right click, or control click, on Photos 3 Library and pick Show Package Contents.  Do not alter, move or delete anything in here.\n\n*Your photo masters are all in the directory Masters in a hierarchical date structure.\n\n*Right/control click on Masters to find out how big it is.  You're going to need that much space.\n\n*Copy the whole folder (press alt and then drag it) to somewhere outside of the library, anywhere you want.\nEt voila.\n", "Q: Howto clean Photo Folder I opened Photo. I deleted all the pictures. Then I emptied the \"Deleted images\".\nMy Photo app is apparently empty.\nI open finder, the photo library package is around 7GB an subfolders are full of old images and other unknown files.\nI wish to clean all, to gain a fresh empty Library.\nIf I delete the .photoslibrary folder, the app shows an error message. \nCan someone tell me the right procedure, please?\n\nA: You can create a new library by opening iPhoto whilst holding ⌥ alt/option. This creates a fresh iPhoto library which you can import media into.\n", "Q: Can I upgrade from iPhone 4 w/ iOS7 to iPhone SE and iTunes restore? Can I upgrade from iPhone 4 running old iOS7 to iPhone SE running iOS 9 and use iTunes backup restore functionality so that I don't have to reinstall everything?\n\nA: Yes.

How do I get rid of it?\n\nThe grid lines don't show up when I do a proper, OS X screenshot. So I've taken a picture of my physical monitor, an Asus monitor, to show the problem.\n\nA: As it turns out, the problem is with the monitor (Asus in my case), not OS X. You should be able to reset this - i.e. make the grid disappear - via the monitor's menu 'System Setup'.\n\nA: S/A button on my Asus monitor turned mine off\n", "Q: GarageBand 10.1.1 Removed MainStage Instruments After updating to GarageBand 10.1.1, all the instruments I've downloaded from MainStage 3 have disappeared from the instrument library. They still seem to be in /Library/Application Support/GarageBand/Instrument Library/Sampler/Sampler Instruments, but they're not showing up in the list. Any projects with the instruments, however, play perfectly with them.\nI'm not talking about Jam Packs here; they're still right there in the \"Legacy\" category. I'm talking about things like the expanded orchestral strings, world music, etc. How can I get these back?\nTopic on the Apple website.\n\nA: To restore all your MainStage3 instruments do this trick which will add new root folder \"User patches\" in the Instrument selector:\n\n\n*\n\n*Quit Garageband\n\n*Open Terminal\n\n*Type these three commands (all are one lines):\n\n\n*\n\n*mkdir \"$HOME/Music/Audio Music Apps/Patches/Instrument\"\n\n*ln -s \"/Applications/MainStage 3.app/Contents/Resources/Patches/Instrument\" \"$HOME/Music/Audio Music Apps/Patches/Instrument/Mainstage\"\n\n*exit\n\n\n*Close Terminal and start GarageBand\n\n*Locate Mainstage3 instruments in the \"User patches\" area or use search box\n\n\nDownside is some patches are now showed twice, but this does not mean your instruments occupy more space or disk or anything. In the steps above, you actually made a symlink from user patch directory into MainStage3 program patch directory, so GarageBand can always access it. This will alway work not matter how many times you update any of the two programs.\nExtra trick: You can edit any patch and save it into Patches/Instrument directory and it will also show up (only first strip channel). This works with all Logic Pro X instruments, including Alchemy and others!\n\nA: I also noticed some instruments that have gone missing, such as the Bosendorfer Piano. Some of them I couldnt seem to get back, but try reinstalling them (like you did when you first got Mainstage)\n", "Q: What is the name of the 'corner swipe' to change motion animations on the Apple Watch?

I just started using OS X El Capitan on a new Mac Book Pro.  I was looking forward to using split screen mode but I cannot get it to work.  I have read online (cnet and apple) that there are two methods:\n\n\n*\n\n*By pressing and holding on the green circle with two outward pointing arrows.\n\n*By making a window full screen, then using mission control to move another application to the same workspace.\n\n\nNeither of these options work for me.\nI did find this post which says that you must have 'Displays have Separate Spaces' enabled (found in System Preferences > Mission Control).  Is this really required?  I often work with an external monitor and it is more intuitive for me to have this setting off.\n\nA: Split screen will only work when you turn on 'Displays have Separate Spaces' setting.  \nAfter you turn this on, you can use both methods you described.\nTo expand on bullet 1, from your desktop (i.e., not in a full screen app), click and hold on the green circle and it will give the option to put a window on the right or left.  It will then prompt to put a second, already open, window on the other side.

I did this set of procedures in my Mac Pro in the past using launchd, but since I now have MacBook Pro only, I cannot ensure that this is always done properly, because I occasionally close the laptop. \nI know how to set the launchd to execute the script once the laptop wakes up, but I still must make sure that this script is executed in the correct time, because the remote database must be set up to be updated every day to ensure that users in my iOS app always see the updated datasets.\nHow can I set it up so that the script is always executed in the exactly same time every day, such as 23:15, even in the laptop is being sleep? I have never shut down the laptop; I just close the tab and go into sleep. \n\nA: The only thing I can think of that will wake a Mac, do maintenance, and put it immediately back to sleep is power nap.

Screen sharing through the app has been shoddy at best for me since updating.  I thought I had it figured out and now its not working this week.  My device on the same network is a linux machine and connecting to it from ssh works fine (always has).  But for whatever reason the screen sharing functionality is Broken.

How to do this depends on the Linux distro you have. Try man vncserver at the command line on the Linux box and see what you get.\nVNC is a screen sharing protocol and SMB is a file sharing protocol so you can't get screen sharing using SMB.\n", "Q: OS X. Should I quit apps or close windows (red cross button behavior)? I've googled a lot about X button, that doesn't quit app, but simply close the window andnd haven't found a clear answer.  I want to be able to know if  open apps affect battery life or other resources.\nShould I quit apps or close windows, letting apps work in background?\n\nA: There's no real easy answers to this. It's going to depend on such things as how much memory your system has, what the apps are, how well are they written etc.\nFor example, if you have a small amount of memory and checking Activity Monitor shows little memory available, or a lot of swap space being used. Then you probably want to ensure apps are quit to make more memory available. Adding to the confusing around this is the fact that even though you quit an app, OS X doesn't remove it from memory until it needs the space for something else. This is why quitting and reopening an app is faster than the first time you started it. If the app is still in memory, OS X only has to start it again. Of course, in a memory tight situation, OS X automatically removes apps from memory which have been quit so that the memory can be available for something else.\nApps which you have closed all windows for, but not quit, can effect the system. It depends on what they do. So memory, CPU, battery can all be consumed. Again Activity Monitor is your friend in determining whether any of your apps are causing problems. \nGenerally speaking, if you have enough memory, and your apps are well behaved in terms of sucking on your battery, then whether you quit or close is not going to matter. Luckily, OS X apps are generally quite well behaved.\n\nA: In general it is fine to just close the windows. If you are a software developer or otherwise have very special needs, you might need to quite the applications explicitly. However, in general - just close the windows.\nThe other answers to your question does not seem to take into account that the mechanism regards closing windows vs. applications was changed with OS X Lion. From that version and on, OS X will automatically quit non-used applications for you.\nThe feature is called Automatic Termination. It quits applications when the system deems it necessary, but only if you have closed all the windows belonging to the application and the application is no longer the active (currently selected) application. In addition, the application needs to opt-in to Automatic Termination - but most ordinary application do opt-in.\n\nA: One of Mac's most confusing features is the red close button, which you think would shut down an application but often doesn't. When you press X button in the window - you actually close the windows related to the app, but it does not quit. Here's more information from Apple's support pages:\n\nClose windows\nWhen you close an app’s window, the window closes, but the app remains open. If you want to quit an app, click the app’s name in the menu bar, then choose Quit [App]. For more information, see Quit apps.\n\nIf you want to quit the app (release the memory, reduce CPU usage, etc) then there are several ways to do this:\n\n*\n\n*Using keyboard shortcut: ⌘ cmd+Q.\n\n*Using contextual menu (or application's menu): Go to the Dock at the bottom of the screen and find the icon for the app, then right click (or ctrl+click) to bring up the contextual menu. At the bottom of this list is the Quit option.\n\n*Using Activity Monitor: Applications>Utilities>Activity Monitor.\n\n*For unresponsive apps: Force Quit (⌘ cmd+⌥ alt+esc)\n\nYou may also want to overload the default behaviour, and to make it like in Windows OS, but you need to use separate utilities (like RedQuits). There are a bunch of those utilities that close applications when you click the the red close button.\nIn overall, to answer your question about how it hits system efficiency, memory and battery: OS X handles it properly and does as much as possible to optimize efficiency, unless the Application itself is written poorly. OS X internally has a lot of optimisations like App Nap which help to keep background apps' effect on system resources to a minimum:\n\nYou don’t have to quit apps once you’re done working in them — OS X allows you to work with several apps open at once. Features such as Compressed Memory and App Nap keep your Mac running fast, and save power when many apps are open.\n\n", "Q: Format menu bar time to english words I saw this screenshot of someone's menu bar and their time formatting is set in readable English.\n\nIs this a this party app or a setting / script I can run on OS X?\n\nA: I wrote a script to do this.\nTo show it in the menubar, use BitBar.

It is similar to a Zip-file. When the app is installed on the phone, it is uncompressed by the app installer software on the phone.\nB) Differential updates\nIf you already have the app installed, and are merely downloading an update for the app - you could be downloading a differential instead of the full app. For newer iOS versions, the App Store will calculate the difference between what you already have and the new version of the app, enabling you to download less. However it will still take up the full amount of space on the disk after the upgrade has taken place.\nC) App downloads after first use\nWhen you use an app for the first time, many apps will download extra data that is stored with the app on your phone. This could account for differences in app size as listed by the App Store, compared to the amount of space the app takes on your phone in practice.\n", "Q: Why does my phone say my photos are like 9Gb out of my phone yet I've deleted thousands of it and I still have no memory left?

I would like to be able to download apps and have my music play without stopping because it \"cannot download song\". Thank you ☺️\n\nA: You've got some different questions here. The iCloud app isn't meant to show your photos; that's what the Photos app is for. When you delete photos, it doesn't actually delete them; it puts them in a folder called \"Recently Deleted\" where they are retained for 30 days before actually being deleted. You have to delete them again from that folder if you want to delete them before the 30 days are up.\nTo see what's using space on your phone, go into Settings / General / Storage & iCloud Usage / Manage Storage (the first one, under \"STORAGE\" not under \"ICLOUD\").\n", "Q: Theft of MacBook running El Capitan: Security Implications My MacBook running El Capitan just got stolen. It was in hibernation, and will display a password prompt on opening the lid next. Assuming a not-very-technical attacker and a solid login password, how likely is it that my account passwords from keychain will leak?\n\nA: Your keychain is encrypted with your login password, so the passwords stored in it should be pretty safe as long as they aren't somewhere else, too. Unfortunately, information sometimes leaks, so there may be notes, password reset emails, etc lying around unencrypted and potentially readable by whoever stole the laptop (or their fence, or...). So in theory your passwords are safe; in practice, you should reset them all.\n\nA: Your data is stored in a non-encrypted form onto your Macintosh HD. A password prevents the users from loading the OS, not from accessing your data. Said that the only way to protect data is encryption, a thief could actually insert a Live USB Bootable device (free and easy to create) with a Linux distro on it (like Ubuntu), mount your HFS+ partition, read the drive, copy it to an external Hard drive as an ISO (Ubuntu has the needed tools preinstalled for doing this) and - at the end - extract your files from the image using a Mac, Linux or Windows PC and maybe even steal your Passwords. This sounds hard to do, but it is very simple, and anyone can do it: I once did this (by extracting a test.txt file located on the Desktop) with my friend's PC to prove him Macs are vulnerable too. You better change all of your passwords: your data is at risk!\n\nA: To answer your main question - they are very unlikely to leak if you stored them in keychain.\n\n\n*\n\n*The attacker would have to know your login password to access every keychain item.\n\n\nHowever - you still need to change them (as you said you would) - especially your email password!\nFirst and foremost the attacker may gain access to your email through your MacBook, if they find a way to circumvent the password prompt! This is your biggest concern in general as most passwords can be reset through email verification.\nRegarding the live-Linux-boot or safe-boot options to access your data, this depends entirely on the question if you have enabled FileVault, which would prevent this (your hard-drive is encrypted in this case) and can't be loaded without knowing the password.\nRegarding the \"safe\" password idea. You mentioned you are at a conference, where possibly many other people could have easily recorded you entering your password or watched you enter it. If you have been targeted specifically, a simply video taken with a smartphone could have easily gone unnoticed by you and your login may be compromised...\n", "Q: My storage on iPad doesn't add up I can't understand what's taking all my storage as the apps listed don't add up and I don't download videos or music etc.\nMy iPad says I've used 12.2GB with 209MB available yet when I added everything up my total usage was 8GB. CONFUSED\n\nA: Most likely it's the operating system, in this case, iOS. The operating system needs a certain amount of space on the iPad.\nIn this way, you don't get the amount of storage that you pay for, since iOS tends to usually take up anywhere from 1 to 4 GB of storage, depending on which version you're running.\n\nA: This issue is a little strange. Have you checked your \"Recently deleted\" album? Maybe it takes up your storage. The pics and videos you deleted are not actually gone. If you want to make them disappeared you need to go to the \"Recently deleted\" album and delete them again. Otherwise you need to wait for 30 days they will be deleted automatically. You should check it.\n", "Q: Changing from Virtual Hard Drive to Blank External Hard Disk I have a blank hard disk (1 TB) that has more space than the virtual disk I am running OS X El Capitan on (89 GB).

Or migrate a VM to bare-metal. Besides the fact that installation of OS X on non-Apple hardware is not covered by the EULA it will not work out-of-the-box! The drivers included in OS X are made for/adapted to Mac hardware and usually don't work with some arbitrary components in your laptop.

Or better: get a Mac!\n", "Q: The podcast app is displaying the incorrect subscribed podcast I am using the official Apple iOS podcast app. \nA strange thing started happening 2 months back. \nI have 5 podcasts that I subscribe to, one of them being the Joe Rogan Experience. One day the Joe Rogan podcast wasn't there anymore and a Christian podcast had taken its place probably a sign.\nI unsubscribed from the Christian one, searched iTunes for the Joe Rogan podcast, and resubscribed. For a full day the app displayed the correct podcast but then magically changed back to the Christian one. \nNow when I try unsubscribe and resubscribe, to the Joe Rogan podcast, it magically subscribes to / displays the \"Intelligence Squared US debates\" podcast. I don't live in the US so this is probably not a sign\nI am using an iPhone (9.3.1) and podcast app (2.4)\nIf I download a different podcast player app (Overcast) and subscribe to the Joe Rogan experience it doesn't change to the random podcast. But the problem still remains in the apple podcast app. \nI did a search and didn't find anyone else experiencing the same problem. Any ideas on what the problem could be or a possible solution?\n\nA: Note that all the podcasts getting mixed up are hosted on Libsyn. There appears to be an issue with certain international CDN's caching rss feeds incorrectly, or so say Libsyn. They have got to fix this issue once and for all. It's still happening to us in 2018.\n\nA: I came across this question because I had the same issue, but since this question didn't have an answer at that time I asked it again here. I kept fiddling with it and eventually found that, as I answered in my own question, \"I'm not sure why this worked, but I reset my iPhone a second time and restored it from the same iCloud backup and that seems to have fixed it.\"\nJust wanted to post the solution that worked for me in this question since it was one I came across while looking for a fix.\n\nA: I have had this happen on several occasions, the most recent being today.\nCurrently Welcome to Nightvale, Lore, History of Japan and 7 or 8 others have been replaced with Dada Land Radio....\nIt seems to happen when I download podcasts when I am abroad with a foreign SIM card.\nApple Support have been less than useless on every occasion I have contacted them.\nOnly fix I have found is to restore a backup... pain in the arse as I work on an oil rig and my backups are on my home computer!!\nGood luck.\n", "Q: Keyboard shortcut for Force Quitting the current application? Instead of pressing Command + Option + Esc to bring up the Force Quit menu, is there a way that I can force quit the application that I'm currently using directly?\n\nA: Found it – the keyboard shortcut I was looking for was Command + Option + Shift + Esc. This will quit the frozen app as long as it's in focus.\n\nA: Well, the Force Quit dialog opens with the currently running application already selected. So the shortcut is kind of Cmd-Opt-EscReturn (which IMHO is good enough for all practical purposes).\n", "Q: Is there an app/extension similar to The Great Suspender but for Safari?

I have one of the new Mac Pros, and I'm thinking about upgrading the internal SSD. It seems that some Amazon sales suggest that the drive is the same format as in the Retina MacBook Pro.\nDoes anyone know for sure? Because if they are the same, the ones listed for the MacBook Pro are about 1/3rd cheaper.\n\nA: The model of MacBook Pro will make a large difference as to whether or not it's compatible with the Mac Pro, assuming you're talking about the \"new\" 2013 model.\nSpecifically, the Mid-2015 MacBook Pro will work, but earlier generations use various different interfaces which will not be compatible.\nAs you can see comparing this photo of a 2012 MacBook Pro's SSD and this photo from the 2013 Mac Pro, the interfaces are completely different. Alternatively, you can see the same pinout in the 2015 MacBook Pro on this page.\nI recommend sticking with 3rd-party upgrades provided by OWC (since they will tell you exactly what they've been tested with), or only getting parts that could have shipped with the original machine. (For example, ordering a broken Mac Pro off of eBay that came with a larger SSD that you can extract.)\n\nA: Thats a darn good question. While I cannot tell you definitively what the differences are, the ssds in apple macbook retinas and 2013 mac pro towers are not identical. I think the difference is in the chipset controllers and you may find the retina one does not work in a mac pro, but the mac pro one works in both. Can anyone confirm ?\nI do not have a 2013 mac pro here at the moment. But it uses (used) an ahci samsung 941 chip , with the apple pinout. More recent ones may use the 951 ahci chip. The same chips in M2 format work in the PCI slots of my 2010 mac pro tower. \nBUT. The Apple SSD from a 2015 retina macbook, with the same pin configuration as the mac pro 2013 chip, does NOT work in my mac pro. It is not recognised in the 2012, 2010, or 2008 mac pro towers. However, it works perfectly in the 4x pcie slot of a mac pro 1,1 (2006 model). As a boot disk, at full speed etc. \nIf anyone knows the technical answer as to why I would love to hear it !\n\nA: I recommend going external because the price of an internal versus an external gets you much, much more.\n\n\n*\n\n*The price for a 1TB SSD for the MacPro is trending at around $950 on eBay\n\n*On Amazon, it's slightly less at $938\n\n*The upgrades by OWC are cheaper than the genuine Apple SSD, but still quite expensive at $895\n\n*The Mac Pro (Late 2013) and the MBP (Mid 2105) use the same SSD (PCIe 2.0 x4) so that pricing is he same.\nIn comparison, you can get a WD My Book Thunderbolt Duo with 4TB for $369 on Amazon that has RAID and easily accessible and serviceable with standard 3.5\" drives.  So, for the price of a 1 TB SSD you can get an 8TB T'bolt storage devices or two 4TB T'bolt storage devices for redundancy .\nLooking at OWC again, they have a 4TB SSD upgrade at $2000.  That's 4 to 5 T'bolt drives.  \n\n", "Q: OS X Server: Open Directory PasswordService crashes I'm running an OS X 10.9 Server (it's a Mac Mini) that is providing a few services (iCal, VPN, file sharing, etc.) to a small group of Local Network Users.\nAfter we installed a security update today, the machine did not reboot properly. When it came back up, the LDAP server seemed a bit confused; the users were nowhere to be found.\nAfter a lot of trial and error, we ended up cleaning it up using db_recover, and openldap appears to be running fine again.\nHowever, not all is well yet. While the users do show up, they cannot actually use any of the services. Adding new users is also a grayed-out button at the moment.\nBased on the Console output, it appears that PasswordService is not starting properly. The following error appears in the Console every few seconds, and it does not seem to be very helpful so far.\ncom.apple.launchd[1]: (com.apple.PasswordService[2141]) Job appears to have crashed: Segmentation fault: 11\ncom.apple.launchd[1]: (com.apple.PasswordService) Throttling respawn: Will start in 10 seconds\nReportCrash[2137]: Saved crash report for PasswordService[2141] version 400.1 to /Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports/PasswordService_2016-04-12-000455_miniserver.crash\n\nI'm at a loss here. A segfault in Passwordservices.. what can I do to debug this?\nNaturaly, when I disable OpenDirectory, the error goes away. But that's precisely the point.\nEdit: turns out, even when I start PasswordService directly from the shell, I get the segfault straight away:\nsh-3.2# /usr/sbin/PasswordService -n\nSegmentation fault: 11\n\n\nA: I come bearing an unfulfilling answer (but it worked): upgrade to OS X El Capitan and Server 5. The reason for the segfault remains unclear, but it was fixed when the configuration was automatically migrated during the upgrade process. Or Apple changed the PasswordService binary - I'm not sure.\n\nA: I figured out that even though my OD restore had worked correctly, something was amiss in SSL certificates and this was why the passwordservice was crashing. The fix for me was to delete the OD and remake it. By doing so, the OD setup in server.app made the necessary certificate and everything worked fine after that.\n", "Q: Song capacity of 1st Gen iPod I had downloaded several songs on my iPod about 2 years ago. I purchased more and downloaded them, but realized many of the original downloads were missing. I tired to download again and it doesn't work. Is there a limit for songs/albums? They are all on my laptop as purchased. I only use it at the gym, but would like to have more choices.\nCan anyone help?\n\nA: Here you can see the capacity in GB and how many songs are estimated for the original iPod.  See linked source below for other models.\n\n\n* Apple estimated the song capacity of the first and second generation iPod using the 160-Kbps MP3 format. These files are larger than the\n  128-Kbps AAC format used to estimate the capacity of subsequent iPod\n  models.\n\nInformation taken from: How many songs does each iPod, iPod mini, iPod nano, iPod touch, and iPod shuffle hold?\n\nA: The first answer answers the question you had about the song capacity of a 1st generation iPod, but I thought I'd offer some additional info as I think the capacity is only part of the answer to your problem.\nPurchasing more songs and syncing them to your iPod would not normally remove the original songs. Syncing can be a little confusing at times, so it's likely that at some point you chose for them to be removed without realising it.\nYour best bet is to connect your iPod to your laptop and use iTunes to determine how much space you actually have left? This will give you an indication as to whether you can just re-select the original songs and have them transferred (synced) to your iPod or whether you have a space management issue. \nIf you've run out of space it's just a case of removing some songs to make room for the ones you want. \nIf you already have the space then you need to work out why you couldn't transfer the songs you wanted. This is where coming back here and asking another question about how to resolve the issue (if you can't find a solution) is probably the way to go. If so, be sure to identify what version of iTunes you're using and what version of Mac OS X or Windows your computer is running. Perhaps even include a screenshot or two of how iTunes looks when you have your iPod connected.\nEither way I hope you resolve your issue. Good luck!\n", "Q: File types in EFI partition In El Capitan, I mounted the EFI partition using sudo diskutil mount /dev/disk0s1 and instead of finding apps that I can run, I found .scap, .smc, .epm, and .efi files. What are these? The reason I ask here is because (for example) a search for \".smc file\" yields \"It's an SNES ROM file\".\n\nA: I don't expect that you're going to find apps that you can run since everything in the EFI partition is presumably dealing with the hardware directly and doesn't conform to a UNIX/BSD/OSX application model. Instead, it is a bit of a mini-OS that has enough drivers to support booting from various devices (disk, USB, network, etc.) before handing control over to the \"booted\" operating system.\nThat all being said, I would imagine that the files you'd find there would be a combination of the raw boot code (i.e. initial bootstrap of UEFI \"mini-OS\"), the main UEFI kernel, various device drivers for the hardware onboard, NVRAM storage and possibly a driver/API that the OS can access to communicate with the above (e.g. setting nvram values).\nThat all being said, I'm sure there are better resources out there on the internet to explain what the exact files are, but I would suspect that there is extremely limited utility for end users since it is all very hardware specific ultimately.\n", "Q: Will Apple service secondhand iPad still under warranty?

Do I have to disclose that I'm not the original owner?\n\nA: Normally saying that you've bought it as secondhand you're ok, even because, before they start working on it, they need to have \"Find my iPhone\" disabled so, if you have stolen that iPad, you wouldn't be able to disable that.\n", "Q: Error when trying to install Homebrew?

You can for example open Word file in the Dropbox App using the Microsoft word App\nNote 2: I am not looking for a specific app for a single printer/model but a generic one supporting a Samba printer with a PS or PCL gener\n\nA: Printers\nI work at a school and we have a printing solution in place for iOS.  However, there is no way to print from an iOS device directly to a shared printer without a middle step unless the printer has built in support for AirPrint.\nThe printers at our school do not support AirPrint, so the solution that we have is as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Printers are installed on the network (Existing Infrastructure)\n\n*iOS Devices would like to use the printers\n\n*Install desired printers to be used by iOS devices on a Mac and share the printers\n\n*Have an intermediate software to publish the printers, there is many out there but we use Papercut\n\n*Printers are now advertised in a Bonjour fashion\n\n*iOS devices can see the printers and print to them\n\n\nThe is just a general overview of how it work at my school, but the idea would be similar everywhere. \nDocument Sharing\nThe easiest way that I have found to share document on your network to iOS devices is via WebDav.  It is basically file sharing over HTTP.  You'll need some sort of Web Server to host the files and then setup a WebDav share.\nTypes of Web Servers could be as simple as a basic user level NAS that supports HTTP sharing (WebDav) or as complicated as having a Web Server that hosts Virtual Directories to network shares.\nOnce you have a WebDav server setup, the app I recommend is WebDav Navigator.  From this app you'll be able to see all the files on your Web Server that you have shared.  You can add authentication and permissions to fit your needs.  \nPut it all together\nOnce you have Printing and WebDav setup you can easily print documents from a network location, you may need a few additional apps on your iOS device. Here are some examples:\nPrint a PDF\nLocate the PDF file in WebDav Navigator on your share.  Open the file, you may need to open with the Adobe Reader app, or another PDF reading app.  Print the PDF to your desired printer.\nPrint a Pages, Number, or Keynote\nThese 3 apps all have built in support for WebDav. Each app is much the same, so from the app itself - to save a file on WebDav Click on the share button --> Send a copy --> Choose file format --> Choose WebDav from the list --> Save it on your share\nTo get a Pages, Numbers, or Keynote file WebDav.  Go to the page where you can see all your Documents and Click the Plus button in the top left corner. You should see Copy From WebDav.  If you don't see it, click on the More button and you'll find it there.\nOnce you have the file in Pages, Numbers or Keynote, you will be able to print directly from the app to your desired printer.\nHope this helps\nEDIT\nSome more info about Papercut\nFirst of all have a really good ready through the iOS setup from Papercut. It goes through step by step how to get Papercut to work on iOS devices.  The article is very good.\nPapercut doesn't have an iOS app (However at our school we call it the Printing App).  It simply installs a Web Clip that links to the Papercut server.  Basically a similar site to their Web Print but shows each user their Printing Queues and print jobs that are waiting to be released etc.  Users have to be logged into this site before they will be able to print.\nWe also have multiple network zones.  Our are separated by vlans and you are right bonjour will not work across network zones.  The work around for up was to buy USB to Ethernet adapters / thunderbolt to Ethernet adapters and plug them into our Mac Mini. I have 5 networks on the Mac Mini all up and it works great for everyone.  As you can see this will quickly be a limitation if you have more than 6 network zones (4 USB slots, 1 thunderbolt, 1 native Ethernet - at least on my Mac Mini).  The next thing to look at would be an mDNS repeater that forwards bonjour traffic across networks.  Avahi is the main one that comes to mind but there is others.\nAgain, hope this helps\n\nA: If you're asking whether there's an iOS app that can somehow 'see' any Samba printer and print to it, my response is that even your question states: \"print to a shared Samba printer\". \nMy point here is that if it's already a shared Samba printer and its shared in a way so iOS devices can print to it, then any iOS app that can open a PDF document could do what you're wanting (i.e. Print to the Samba printer).\nPut another way, for an iPhone/iPad etc to print to a Samba printer it must be able to 'see' the printer first. So, unless it's one that supports AirPrint natively, you'd need to use some software to make it visible to iOS devices. There's quite a few options out there (e.g. http://www.netputing.com) that people can use to make their shared printers visible to iOS devices.\nOtherwise, as far as I know there is no iOS app out there that can print to a Samba printer that it can't actually see.\nI hope this helps, one way or another.\n", "Q: OS X Server MailBox size expand I'm running OS X Server app version 5.1. I have mail configured for all my users. I have a default value of 200 MB for each mail box, as the server is only 256 GB. Is there any way to change the mail box location to my attached external NAS so I can locate more then 50 GB mail space to each user.\n\nA: You two options to change the mail box location:\n\n*\n\n*You can either change the Server Data location to an external volume or a share:\nOpen Server.app. In the left pane choose Server -> server_name -> Settings -> Service Data. Hit the button Change Location and choose another volume. This will copy all service data to a new location. Before migrating the services will be shut down automatically.\n\n\n*Or you copy the Mail folder /Library/Server/Mail to a different location\nStop the mail service. Copy/rsync the folder /Library/Server/Mail to a different volume/share. Keep the original permissions! Remove the original folder and symlink back the new location to /Library/Server/Mail.\nAfter moving the mail data location adjust the mail box size and start the mail service again.\n", "Q: Problem when booting OS X from an external USB drive I would like to create a Fusion Drive from my SSD and HDD both installed inside my MacBook Pro 15\" Mid 2012. I've read an article online which said that in order to do that, I'd need to boot Mavericks from an external USB drive. So I've picked a 64 GB USB stick and partitioned it in two, 8 GB for the installer and the rest for the operating system to install to. I've managed to create the USB installer of Mavericks using Unibeast, the installer boots without any problem, it installs normally but when I reboot I get a stop sign with a spinning wheel under it. How can I solve this problem?\nThe tutorial I'm trying to follow to create the Fusion drive is this one: Manually Create an Apple Fusion Drive on Mountain Lion/Mavericks/Yosemite\n\nI need to create a Fusion drive from the 2 internal drives (240GB SSD and 1TB HDD). On the SSD I already have installed El Capitain and I used the HDD to store files. Now I've seen that you can merge this two in a single LogicalVolume and OS X will see it as if it were a Fusion Drive.\n\nA: You do not need Unibeast (a tool for hackintoshes) to create an external installer. Can you confirm you're only using it to run the createinstallmedia command provided by apple as per this page?\nApart from that it seems you are confusing an external Mavericks installation with an external Mavericks installer. All you should have to do is double click the installer, straight from the App Store still laying in /Applications on your internal drive, then pick the external volume as a target (wipe the current ones and make a new one for the entire stick). Using all-apple tools should make that go smooth. \nThen just boot from the external stick by holding down opt at boot, and complete the guide. \nWhen in doubt or in need in help, always boot in verbose mode to get more information, and above all, do not over complicate things. \n\nA: You can't simply create a DIY-Fusion Drive with already existing partitions containing a system and data while preserving the data on both.\nYou either loose both partitions (using the linked guide) or at least one using an undocumented diskutil command.\n\n\n*\n\n*diskutil cs create ...\nIf you create your Fusion Drive with diskutil coreStorage create myLogicalVolGroup /dev/disk0(s2) /dev/disk1(s2) and diskutil coreStorage createVolume lvUUID jhfs+ \"name\" 100% both partitions (disk0s2 and disk1s2) will be erased and all data is lost.\n\n*diskutil cs convert ...\nAn undocumented feature is the diskutil cs addDisk .... After converting one volume with diskutil cs convert /dev/disk0s2 to a CoreStorage Logical Volume Group and CoreStorage Logical Volume you may add a second Physical Volume to the existing LVG and later expand the LV to the full size. The content of the converted will survive, the content of the added PV will be erased.\nTo add a 2nd PV enter first diskutil list and diskutil cs list to get an overview. Now add a PV with diskutil cs addDisk lvgUUID /dev/diskXsY to the existing LVG (with diskXsY: the disk identifier of the partition to add and lvgUUID: the UUID of the Logical Volume Group). Then expand diskutil cs resizeVolume lvUUID 100% (with lvUUID: the UUID of the Logical Volume).\nThe addDisk/resizeVolume commands often fail with some obscure errors.\n\nTo preserve all data back it up and then use a the mentioned guide!\n", "Q: Geotagging with Photos or other app I've got ~100GB of photos that I've imported into Photos. Photos stayed in place because they are in date related subfolders. I would stay with original sorting as it is more usable with other photo apps.\nI decided to add geocoding to photos manually (without gpx track). Photos app does its job. I also rotated couple of the photos (my old camera doesn't have orientation sensor). So I would like to save back changes to original photos (overwrite them).\nThe problem is that I'm not able to export photos into the same directory structure that I've used originally. So it is a real pain to export than overwrite images manually. Other issue is that I will lost the original file dates of the photos (Photo app creates file with current date).\nIs there any app that able to hand this situation?\n\nA: You can use HoudahGeo to write location information back into the original image files.\n\n\n*\n\n*Using the media browser in HoudahGeo, add the photos to a new project\n\n*HoudahGeo will ask about camera clock settings. Click OK, you don’t need accurate timestamps for this procedure\n\n*Select EXIF/XMP export from the Output menu\n\n*Use the following settings:\n\n\n*\n\n*Uncheck “Selected images only”\n\n*Check “Geotagged images only”\n\n*Tag: “Original images”\n\n*Uncheck “Create copies”. Be sure to have a backup\n\n*XMP Sidecars: “Write to sidecar if present”\n\n*Uncheck “Notify media library”\n\n*Select Coordinates and other properties you want to export\n\n*Be sure NOT to export timestamp. You did not give HoudahGeo accurate information on the camera clock setup\n\n\n\nFull disclosure: I am the developer of HoudahGeo.\n", "Q: What environment variables are set in .profile for OS X? I accidentally overwrote my .profile file and I believe deleted my environment variables. To be honest, I don't really understand how the operating system handles environment variables. My rough understanding is that there are configuration files like .profile which the operating system looks at, or runs, automatically and sets the environment variables that way. But how does the system know which config files to run? Are there default config files? Is .profile a default config file in OS X? If .profile is one of these default config files, is there a way for me to retrieve it or else the environment variables that it sets by default. What are the default values for .profile in OS X? \n\nA: In your terminal that still has the variables write printenv > with_profile.txt. This will dump all available variables into with_profile.txt. Open a new terminal window and write printenv > without_profile.txt. \nStart python and write:\nwith open(\"with_profile.txt\") as w_profile, open(\"without_profile.txt\") as wo_profile: \n    w_profile_vars = {line.strip() for line in w_profile}\n    wo_profile_vars = {line.strip() for line in wo_profile}\n    for var in w_profile_vars - wo_profile_vars: \n        print var\n\nThat should print the set of missing variables one by one.\nP.S.\n~/.profile is not there by default (not on Mavericks, Yosemite and El Capitan for sure). Hence it's possible that you overwrote nothing, unless you had created the file yourself a long ago. \n", "Q: AppleScript returns error on defining date my following code returns an error\ntell current application\n    set b to \"Tuesday 12 April 2016 at 18:06:10\"\n    date b\nend tell\n\nIf I would write the string, defined in b, directly before date, it is working, but my date string is defined by some variables, so b is just an example for the string, how it looks like.\nBut why does AppleScript returns the error, only because of the string is defined in a variable?\n\nA: Try:\nset dateString to \"Tuesday, April 12, 2016 at 12:00:00 AM\"\nset dateReference to date dateString\n\ntell current application\n    -- insert commands here\nend tell\n\nAnother approach:\nset y to 2001\nset m to 6\nset d to 12\nset h to 12\nset min to 12\nset s to 12\n\nset cd to current date\ntell cd\n    set its year to y\n    set its month to m\n    set its day to d\n    set its hours to h\n    set its minutes to min\n    set its seconds to s\nend tell\n\n\nA: Your syntax isn't quite right.\nFirst, you don't need to \"tell\" anything. Leave the \"tell\" and \"end tell\" off. Dates are not specific to any particular app so you don't need to \"tell.\" This may be the entire problem.\nSecond, if you do something like this:\nset a to current date\n\nYou will get a result like this (not exactly like this, because it is particular to your date and time preferences):\ndate \"Tuesday, April 12, 2016 at 10:39:44 AM\"\nThat's the \"result\" of the one-line script above. Notice the commas.\nYour script where you set \"b\" does not include commas and that may be where it goes wrong. I think if you run a one-line script like I showed above you will see the proper syntax. Once you see it, you can change your string in the line where you set b to match the syntax the system expects. If you are using the proper syntax (that is, matching what you get when you ask for current date) then your problem is exclusively that you've wrapped your date commands in the \"tell\" block, and the app you're \"telling\" doesn't understand how to do it. Leave the \"tell\" wrapper off. Get your date stuff done outside of that. Your date \"b\" will still work later on in your script, in a tell block. But you have to do your date work outside of a tell block.\n", "Q: Upgrading to New MacBook Pro Currently I have the MacBook Pro Mid'12 and which comes with a 500 GB HDD I want to upgrade to the 2015 model MacBook Pro. I have cleared my MacBook out so I have now used around 130GB which SSD will I need 256GB or 512GB? \n\nA: It is your decision and you need to evaluate the circumstances, but keep in mind that you cannot expand the storage. If you see yourself needing a large amount of storage for something like photos or videos, I would recommend the 512. Mine is a 256 and I'm fine with it though.\n\nA: I would get the larger SSD. You'll never be sorry that you have \"too much\" storage.\nWhether you get the 512 GB or the 256 GB, there is currently at least one option for expanding the 2015 MacBook Pro storage: memory that goes into the SD Card slot. Transcend makes a variety of card (different capacities, and different shapes to sit flush with the various MacBook Pros and MacBook Airs). You can use their site to see what would work in the MacBook Pro you are thinking of buying. \nAdding an SD card gives you a second volume on the MacBook Pro. It does not \"merge\" with the built-in storage but you can probably find a way to use it that works for you. Some people use the SD card memory for music, some for photos. \n(Technically you can combine two physical storage units into a single \"logical\" unit (that is, one icon on the desktop). It is not what I would recommend here.)\nI am not affiliated with Transcend but I have used their products and they work fine.\nhttp://www.transcend-info.com/support/Compatibility\n\nA: Physically either of the 256GB or 512GB options will satisfy your requirements as you only have 130GB of data on your old device.\nApple tends to charge more for upgrades than 3rd party options, however there is some value in having an OEM solution to storage. You could start with 256GB and use a 3rd party upgrade down the line to obtain more storage if you feel technically inclined enough to do the hard drive swap. It's certainly very simple to do and there are many walkthroughs available on the internet. For instance, here are the instructions for performing this upgrade on a 2014 Retina MacBook Pro. The steps for a more recent generation Retina Macbook Pro would be similar.\n", "Q: Does an ipad (iOS) need to be restarted occasionally? Most of our webapp users never restart their ipads. (They think they are but they are just putting them to sleep).\nDoes the iPad reclaim memory, storage, etc. from apps that were never closed?

I've found it to be a good best practice. If nothing else it just gives you a clean slate to begin on again! I hope this helps you out! \n", "Q: Access to MacBook Air backup files I am trying to access some lost photos from a MacBook Air backup (I no longer have the computer). I am denied acess to pictures folder because I don't have permissions. How can I log in with password and get access? This was my wife's computer; she has the  login credentials, I just need to know how. \nI have a MacBook Pro laptop with OSX Yosemite, with Time Machine to a 2Tb G Technology G-Drive with USB 3.0. The backup I am trying to access is a 2013 file (G-Drive/Backups/LuAnne'sMacBookAir/Latest/MacintoshHD/Users/luanne/Pictures)\nClicking on \"Pictures\" denies access by saying \"You do not have permission to open the document “Pictures”.\"\n\nA: If you are an administrator (i.e. have an admin account) on the MacBook Air and are familiar with the command line interface you can use the sudo command to obtain machine-level admin rights. Once you have those rights, you can access the files in that folder.\nAn example of this might be:\n$ cd ~/Desktop\n$ mkdir luannsphotos\n$ sudo cp -R G-Drive/Backups/LuAnne'sMacBookAir/Latest/MacintoshHD/Users/luanne/Pictures/* luannsphotos\n\nThis is pseudo-\"code\", but essentially I've created a folder in your home folder, and then recursively copied the contents of that folder you referenced into this new folder.\n\nA: You could use \"BatChMod\"to change the permissions on the folder and its contents to your own user's credentials (that is, to the credentials of the user you are logged in with on the machine you've connected the backup disk to). This is much easier than using the command line.\nhttp://www.lagentesoft.com/batchmod/\nI am not associated with the people who make BatChMod but I use their product. It is \"donation-ware.\"\n\nA: You can do this quite easily by \"taking ownership\" of the files.  By issuing the command:\nsudo chown -R <username> **file/folder**\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo executes the command as a root (aka \"Super User\").  It will ask you to enter a password when you press Return\n\n*chown is the command that \"changes ownership\"\n\n*-R tells it to do it recursively through all sub-folders\n\n* is your currently logged in username.  If you don't know this execute the command whoami at the Terminal prompt and the system will respond back with your username\n\n*file/folder is the filename or folder that you want to change the ownership of\n\n\nSo, for your particular scenario:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the Terminal App (It's under Applications --> Utilities)\n\n*Type the following sudo chown -R <username> /Volumes/G-Drive/Backups/LuAnne'sMacBookAir\nThis will take ownership of everything in the directory \"LuAnne'sMacBookAir\" and below.  It may take a few moments depending on how much \"stuff\" you have in the directory. \n\n\n*Verify you have access by trying to open one of the files by double clicking on them.\n\n\nOnce complete, you should have full access to everything that you want access to. You can copy things over, delete them or even edit them in place.  \n", "Q: Is there any App where I can show where I click on an non-jailbroken iPad?

Related: Chrome: Keyboard shortcut to go to Address Bar?\nYou can go to address bar by ⌘+l / Ctrl+l, but how can I go back to, or focus, the browsing area again?\n\nA: [EDIT:]\nDoes simply pressing Tab a few times work for you?\n[/EDIT]\nThere doesn't seem to be such a shortcut. What you can do is press CTRL+F, search for a word close to where you are on the page and then Esc.\nOf course this is not really convenient, so you could also do what this other answer suggests and type javascript: in the url bar, followed by Enter. This executes the javascript following the colon, so it does nothing. However, it DOES refocus the page.\nThis is still not convenient, but using AutoHotkey, you can remap any shortcut you'd like to do this. The AutoHotkey Script would probably have to simulate CTRL+L to make sure focus lies on the url bar, followed by javascript: and Enter.\nI hope this helps. Sadly, AutoHotkey is only available for windows but there might be a similar tool for Mac.\n\nAnother option I just found out about: On windows, I can press Alt followed by Tab. This might work on mac as well.\n\nA: There's no good way to do it, but if you're focusing the address bar to copy the URL, you could install something like Vimium, it ads yy hotkey that saves the URL to the clipboard.\n\nA: I have a solution for this, which works, but it's a little convoluted. You need to install Vimium (Chrome extension) + Keyboard Maestro (commercial Mac automation software).\nVimium has a shortcut m that allows you to save your scroll position to a named register, e.g. a, so ma will save your scroll position to a register a, and to go back to that position you type `a.\nSo the solution is to create two macros (automations) in Keyboard Maestro:\nThe first one detects ⌘L and then simulates the keypresses mm before the ⌘L. What this does is bookmark your scroll position before focussing the address bar.\nThe second macro is a keyboard shortcut that simulates a ⌘f keypress followed by space followed by esc followed by ` followed by m. In my example I've mapped this to ^P for 'page'. What this does is use the ⌘F workaround to focus the page, and then triggers Vimium's go to mark hotkey (specifying m as the mark to go to, which was set in the previous automation).\n\n\n\nA: Pressing Tab should be doing what you want. This works even when the page has no focus-able elements. Tab will cycle though all the focus-able page elements and return to the address bar/location field, and whatever other browser UI controls can receive focus, in a loop, in that order.\nSimple example: setting focus to the address bar/location field pressing Cmd+L/Crtl+L, pressing Tab proceeds from the address bar/location field, to the page/first focus-able element, through the page's other focus-able elements in the order determined by the HTML/JavaScript, and then back to the address bar/location field.\nMore complicated example with other browser UI present: with the Inspector open, then setting focus to the address bar/location field pressing Cmd+L/Crtl+L, pressing Tab proceeds from the address bar/location field, to the next browser UI controls, which is the Inspector (and through all it's focus-able controls), and then to the page.\n\nA: Cmd+Option+Up/Down cycles focus between address bar, tab bar, bookmarks bar and page content. Therefore, you can use these shortcuts to get from the address bar back to the page content.\n(On Windows and Linux, the same can be done by using F6 and Shift+F6)\nSource: https://keycombiner.com/collections/chrome/\n\nA: The following works if:\n\n*\n\n*You are using Shortcat - a tool for macOSac similar to what Vimium is to Google Chrome.\n\n*Your mouse is inside the Google Chrome window.\n\nYou can press your Shortcat hotkey and just press \"Enter\". It works as though just clicking the mouse left key wherever the mouse current position is.\n\nA: Pressing esc will \"undo\" your previous keystroke and eventually take you back to the browsing area. You may have to press esc multiple times though.\n\nA: I handled the problem by installing autokey (linux) and creating a macro for\n<Alt>+<Esc> which essentially runs <Esc><Tab>. After that I have focus to the website.\nNote that I have switched Esc and Caps.\n\nA: Press F6 a few times (two in my case) to cycle the focus between URL bar, tabs, address bar and browsing content.\nI'm not sure there's an exact number of times his has to be done, since others might have the address bar hidden, or some other config settings so maybe this varies depending on these settings.\n", "Q: Apple IPad 16gb I have all the necessary information like password and email address but I am unable to remove the apple account / icloud / iTunes accounts from my new device.

See the picture. The purple arrow is pointing to the red circle with (in this case) \"90\" in it.\nYou do have to move the books a little bit but you don't have to move them far for the selected count to show up. \n\n\nA: Finding the number of books by selecting all and moving them a bit until a number shows up works well if you have a smaller library. But if you have a large library of over 1000 books you can be waiting a long time for a number to pop up!\nA better method is go to into iTunes and click on the device icon (shown in the red circle)...\n\nAssuming you have synced your iPhone or iPad you'll see the device icon in iTunes. The cool thing is that your device doesn't have to be connected when you do this. (If, for some reason, the device icon is missing, just connect your device). When you click on the device icon you'll see a list in the left margin which includes Books. Click on Books and make sure \"Sync Books\" is checked and that you've selected the \"All books\" button underneath. This will give you the total number of books in your library.\n\n", "Q: Do Sophos and Spotlight conflict and if so, how can I run both applications without problems? I just got a brand new 13\" MacBook Pro at work.  I have noticed that Spotlight has been running constantly giving me ~4 hours of battery life.  The motivation for getting this laptop was to have the portability of an 8+ hour laptop.  \nSearching online, I saw indexing a directory that is synced by a service such as Dropbox/Syncthing would lead to excessive indexing.  To eliminate this as the source of the problem, I excluded from the Spotlight indexing the directories updated using sync services.  I even went so far as to exclude my entire home directory from Spotlight.  Yesterday I tried deleting the Spotlight index forcing it to re-index, and it has been running constantly for the last 24 hours without change.  The hard drive is 512 GB but only have 122 GB of data.\nI now think the problem may be caused by Sophos, the required anti-virus software.  I have seen other posts commenting on these applications conflicting but the solutions recommend removing Sophos, not an option for me.  Are there settings that allow these applications to ignore each other?  Perhaps I need to have Spotlight ignore the Sophos files.  Where are the status files for Sophos stored? \nEdit:\nHere are the results of the command mdutil -a -s (I get the same result with/without sudo):\n2016-04-18 00:36:53.470 mdutil[12692:72953] Metadata.framework [Error]: mdsCopyStorePaths failed: (268435459) (ipc/send) invalid destination port\nSpotlight server is disabled.\n\nI am not entirely sure what to make of this.  Viewing the system status using htop, the most demanding process is /System/Library/CoreSerices/Spotlight.app/Contents/MacOS/Spotlight using 112-160% of a CPU.\nThis Apple thread recommends completely deleting the /.Spotlight-V100/ directory and rebooting.  I tried this but it does not seem to do anything.  After rebooting, the folder was not recreated, Spotlight is still consuming a excessive system resources, and mdutil still reports the same thing (I tried enabling the server using the commandmdutil -a -i onbut this produces the same output asmdutil -a -s` shown above).\n\nA: They don't conflict. Spotlight is a pig on any first run on a newly accessed filesystem. On the other hand, Sophos will double the load caused by controlling all these filesystem accesses.\nI suggest you to let Spotlight terminate its heavy initial run alone\nby temporarily turning off the On-Access control of Sophos:\n\nI also suggest you to turn off the scan on Files on network volumes, because this will load your Mac, your network and finally\nyour network volumes. On a well managed network, this scanning should be\nrun directly on the storage servers.\nOnce this 1st run terminated, Spotlight will less tend to be a CPU and I/O hog.\n", "Q: How do i add someone else's iPhone contact number to messaging on an iPad?

Set the Camera Model to include what you saw in the Info pane. In my case, it's iPhone 6s. See below.\n\nIf you show the Sidebar (View menu) you will then see your Smart Album somewhere in it. Here's how it looked here.\n\nIf you are showing the Sidebar, and you click on \"All Photos\" under the heading \"Albums\" (not \"Photos\" at the very top), you will notice that View/Sort will say something like \"Keep sorted by oldest date added.\" This may give you a second chance at figuring out which photos are your girlfriend's, because the sorting is by date ADDED and not date \"taken.\" So the pictures that were newly added would be at the bottom, and those are probably your girlfriend's. You could select them and put them into a regular album and you'd be all set.\nPersonally I am hoping that you two have different iPhone models because the Smart Folder method would be very cool.\n", "Q: iMessages sent by me to one friend only go to their MacBook not their iPhone iMessages sent from me to my friends, but not others, only go to their MacBook, not their iPhone. However, my friend receives iMessages from others to both MacBook and iPhone.

Your friend can do this in the Settings app > Messages > Send & Receive > \"you can be reached at\"\n", "Q: Disk utility killed my external drive I have a problem with disk utility. I have a external USB3 drive, formatted HFS+. It should hold roughly 500GB out of 1TB of Data. Now Finder told me, that the data was there but no files were visible (out of the blue, of course).\nWhen I ran First Aid in disk utility, it immediately returned a \"operation complete\" (or the likes - my OS is running on German). Unfortunately my volume is now toast, displays as untitled, is unmountable and is displayet to be full to the last bit with \"other\".\nDid I mention, I'm a bit desperate?\n\nA: Running Diskutil in command line mode is pretty much the same as running it in the GUI and that is the right way to go: select the disk and click on repair. Or do it the way \"perhapsmaybeharry\" indicated. Either should work.\nIf that fails you may need to try a dedicated disk repair program (I use Diskwarrior but there are others that work well too).\nLikely a bad sector cropped up at the wrong place at the wrong time that the drive firmware could not fix. It is unlikely that Disk Utility did anything. And another disk repair utility may be able to fix this.\nIf it can't you may have to send it off to a data recovery company, but that is expensive and DiskWarrior (or others) is likely to fix it.\n", "Q: How to ignore S.M.A.R.T. error during El Capitan update?

In short, I know what I'm doing.\nI want to ignore this error and force the update. How to do that?\n\nA: I had that happen to me with a 2011 MacBook Pro.

I would like to browse video website on my iPhone and start watching videos on my Mac. I don't want to use Airplay as my Wifi connection is not good. I would like to just send an URL to a video player like VLC on my Mac which streams the video itself.\n\nA: This is the sort of thing that Handoff (part of Continuity) would ideally be used for, but third-parties have been very slow to adopt it. And you presumably want something better than pasting URLs into the built-in Notes app, with iCloud syncing turned on.\nIf it's always URLs you want to send, your best bet is possibly a third-party tool for sharing and syncing clipboard items between iOS and Mac, such as Cloud Clip.\n", "Q: Can Recovery Mode install OS X onto a blank SSD? I want to install a new Solid State Drive (SSD) into the Mac.

I would go for the Samsung 850 EVO SSD - 500GB. My Mac is a MacBook Pro Mid 2012, model A1278.\n\nA: The answer is \"yes.\"\nI want to install a new Solid State Drive (SSD) into the Mac. Can I just build in the SSD, start the MacBook in Recovery Mode and install OS X from there on?\nIt's called Internet Recovery.  You basically hold ⌘ Command⌥ Option R to launch an installer sourced from Apple over the Internet.\nOS X Daily has a good write-up about it.\nI have done this personally on several MBPs.  One caveat to keep in mind is that it will install the latest version of OS X that is linked to the account/machine.  If it was Mavericks or Yosemite, that's what you will get.  If you didn't have El Capitan, you will have to upgrade to it once the install is finished.  \nInternet Recovery is also a bit slow (dependent on your Internet speed/bandwidth).  What I have done is create a USB installer of my image and then put it away for safe keeping.  When I have to fix someone's Mac and reinstall, instead of going though the hassle of installing an out-of-date OS X then upgrading to the latest, I just install the latest from scratch via USB.  \nCreate a USB Installer\nAfter downloading the Installer Application, Using a blank USB flash drive (8GB or larger for El Capitan, 16GB or larger for Sierra/High Sierra), issue the following command (replace \"Untitled\" with the name of the volume that gets mounted if different):\nsudo /Applications/Install\\ macOS\\ Sierra.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/Untitled --applicationpath /Applications/Install\\ macOS\\ Sierra.app\n\nThe example above uses Sierra as the Installer.  The instructions are the same for El Capitan and High Sierra with the only exception being the path; modify accordingly.\n\nA: Hold down the Command ⌘OptionR keys at startup to boot to OS X Internet Recovery. From there you can at least install the OS X that came with your computer. You may be able to install the latest version of OS X that you purchased through the Mac App Store. See \"OS X: About OS X Recovery\" for more details. Before installing OS X, you may need to run the Disk Utility to create a installation partition on your new drive.\nIf you have installed OS X and it is not the latest version, you may want run the App Store application to download the latest version. Once OS X downloads, you have two options.\n\n\n*\n\n*Run the installer and upgrade to the latest version of OS X.\n\n*Quit the installer and copy the installer to a flash drive. The\ninstruction are given at \"Create a bootable installer for OS\nX\". You can then hold down the Option key at\nstartup and select to boot from the flash drive. You can erase your\nSSD and install a clean copy of the version of OS X stored on the\nflash drive.\n\n\nCreating the USB flash drive has the following advantages.\n\n\n*\n\n*You can also use the flash drive to install OS X on other Macs.\n\n*You use the flash drive as a substitute for the hidden OS X Recovery\npartition stored on your internal SSD. Both provide the same\nfunctions. If your internal OS X Recovery partition is damaged, you\ncan still use the flash drive.\n\n*If Apple removes the version of OS X stored on the flash drive from\nthe Mac App Store, you will still have the installation files stored\non the flash drive. For example, Yosemite OS X 10.10 currently is\ncurrently not available in the Mac App Store.\n\n\nOne can find stories posted on the internet similar to the following.\n\nAn individual owns a older model Mac that can run Yosemite but not El Capitan. Their computer crashes and they have to reload. They can install the version of OS X that came with their computer, but this version is to old to be useful. They go to the Mac App Store just to learn Yosemite is not available. If they had created the flash drive when they first installed Yosemite, then reinstalling Yosemite would not be a problem.\n\nAnother alternative would be to have saved the Yosemite installer file, download from the Mac App Store, in a safe location.\n", "Q: Restoring an iPhone that cannot be detected I have iPhone 4 and my iOS is 4.10.01. I jailbroke it and installed a lot of applications. Being lazy to reinstall everything again every time after an upgrade, I decided to just leave it at iOS 4.10.01. It worked fine for a while but as new iOS versions came up, many of the applications I installed stopped working. I didn't care much for this as long as Cydia and my packages were working all right. However, at some moment the Cydia icon just disappeared, and I don't remember deleting it, though the installed packages continued working fine.\nYesterday, I wanted to update one of the packages as it wasn't functioning correctly. Searching the web for a method to restore Cydia without affecting applications suggested a method, which I tried. However, this failed and all the packages I installed were gone. Trying to reinstall them resulted in multiple errors being returned by Cydia.\nI decided that it might be better to update iOS for the last time and start over, but that doesn't seem to be an option. The \"update\" option in Settings isn't there, and iTunes fails to be recognise the iPhone. Reinstalling iTunes multiple times does not seem to rectify the issue. I've also tried all my USB ports, along with iFunBox. As of now, I can browse media from my computer, but that's as much as I'll get.\nWhat is causing me to not be able to restore my iPhone?\n\nA: To restore your iPhone, boot it into recovery mode and wipe it from there.\nTo boot your iPhone into recovery mode and restore it to the latest version of iOS supported by your iPhone:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your iPhone by holding the lock button.\n\n*Connect the USB end of your connection cable (presumably 30-pin by your software) to your computer but not to your phone.\n\n*After the iPhone is off, hold the home button as you plug in the 30-pin connector.\n\n*Your phone should start and iTunes should detect \"an iPhone in recovery mode that must be restored before it can be used with iTunes\".\n\n*Restore to the latest version of iOS that is supported by your iPhone (by iOS 4, I would assume an iPhone 3G, which supports versions of iOS < 4.2.1)\n\n", "Q: OS X Server DNS, on local network redirect external IP to internal IP I want it to be so that, when I attempt to visit my server at 94.xx.xx.xx, it will automatically redirect me to the internal address 192.xx.xx.xx, when doing so from the local network. Can this be done with OS X DNS and if so how?\n\nA: No, it cannot be done by OS X DNS or any DNS, because you aren't interacting with DNS in your situation (according to your comment). Domain Name Service translates domain names into IP addresses and you aren't using any domain names to access the server.\nIf however, you set up DNS and used one name on external DNS and the same name on internal DNS - the same name could resolve to different addresses.\n\n\n*\n\n*name.pretendco.com 94.2.3.4\n\n*name.pretendco.com 192.168.3.4\n\n\nIt doesn't matter if the numbers are at all similar, but you might find it easier to map things or check that the servers are correct. Setting up an internal DNS is worth the effort if you have several dozen hosts - otherwise it's easier to overload the local hosts file on the machines that need to resolve the name \"internally\" as opposed to externally.\n(If you were using fully qualified domain names, there are ways to do this…I don't how \"accepted\" they are and I'm not enough of an expert to tell you all the possible side effects, but it can work.)\nThe issue you're having is a routing issue, from what I understand. Your public IP address is on a router that is not your server. Your server uses port forwarding on the router to receive traffic. You'd like to be able to connect to the public IP but from inside the local network. You need to enable/configure Hairpin NAT on your router, if it's supported. I can't think of any other solutions.\n\nA: One way of resolving this is to add a DNS entry for this IP address, and use the name instead of the IP itself. Since you're connecting via IP, you're never using DNS.\nThis only works, however, if wherever you're accessing this from internally uses an internally-run DNS server. This would mean that you'd setup server.yourdomain.com on your internal DNS server to point at the internal IP, and server.yourdomain.com on an external DNS server to point to the external IP.\nThen, when you try to access server.yourdomain.com inside your network, it resolves via the internal DNS server, and when you try to access from outside of your network, it resolves via the external DNS server.\n", "Q: 35 \"Flash Player\" in DiskUtility from sudo diskutil list I get 35 of these\n/dev/disk35 (disk image):\n#:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n0:     Apple_partition_scheme                        +17.9 MB    disk35\n1:        Apple_partition_map                         32.3 KB    disk35s1\n2:                  Apple_HFS Flash Player            17.9 MB    disk35s2\n\nsudo diskutil umountDisk /dev/disk35 gives a hopeful Unmount of all volumes on disk35 was successful, but if I list it is still there.\nAny idea why this happens? and how to get rid of these Flash Player images?\nCheers,\nRoberto\n\nA: The disk \"Flash Player\" is still attached to the filesystem. Go into /Volumes, and you should see it there. There are two ways to proceed, the GUI method, or the command line method. Use whichever you are most comfortable with.\nGUI: Navigate to /Volumes and press ⌘ Command+E. This will eject the volume.\nCLI: diskutil eject /dev/diskx, in this case disk35. This will also eject the volume.\n\nThe difference between diskutil unmountDisk and diskutil eject is that unmountDisk only ceases disk-IO between the disk and the filesystem, but keeps it attached so that it can be mounted later. However, eject effectively 'removes' it from the filesystem, and remounting it may involve physically reconnecting the disk. Think of them as \"stand by\" and \"shutdown\" respectively on a computer.\nFrom man diskutil:\n\ndiskutil eject\nEject a disk.  Media will become offline for the purposes of being a data store for file systems or being a member of constructs such as software RAID or direct data.  Additionally, removable media will become eligible for safe manual removal; automatically-removable media will begin its physical (motorized) eject sequence.\n\nwhereas\n\ndiskutil unmountDisk\nUnmount an entire disk (all volumes).  Force will force-unmount the volumes (less kind to any open files; see also umount (8)).  You should specify a whole disk, but all volumes of the whole disk are attempted to be unmounted even if you specify a partition.\n\n", "Q: In Applescript, how do I get a line number or stack trace on error?

How do I do that in Pages 5.2.2 on a Mac?\n\nA: You can enable \"Show Invisibles\" from View > Show Invisibles or ⌘ Command+⇧ Shift+I to see these \"invisible\" characters in Pages. These are invisibles that appear when the selection highlight goes over their area, and disappear when unhighlighted. For identification purposes they're usually colored blue.\nTo add a non-invisible paragraph symbol (or any other delimiter of your choice), ⌃ Control+⌘ Command+Space should bring up a \"Characters\" window, from which you can double-click on any character to add it to the current text field.\nThe characters under this window follow their Unicode specification, so some names might seem a little weird (e.g. \"Place of Interest Sign\" for \"⌘\").  The name for the Paragraph symbol is \"Pilcrow\".\n\nA: With the US keyboard layout, you can make the ¶ sign with the key combination Option/Alt+7.\n", "Q: How do I stop people reading my iMessages as they come in? I don't want anyone to be able to see from whom I am receiving iMessages or text messages or the content of those messages. \nCan I hide both!?\n\nA: If you mean from the Lock Screen or Notifications Centre, then\nSettings > Notifications > Messages\nswitch off Lock Screen &/or Notification Centre\n.. or if you simply want the content of the messages disabled, lower down the screen [out of sight on this image] uncheck Show Previews - though that will show who sent a message, but not the content.\n\n", "Q: Buy an App on the Mac App Store without having enough HD space If you don’t have enough free space on your HD, and you are trying to buy an App in the AppStore, you get a message, that you don’t have enough free space and you can’t buy it.\nSince I always struggle with HD space and often don’t want to download the app immediately, I was wondering if there is a way to buy the app, even without enough free memory.\n(I know, I know, I should free up more memory … but this is hard on a 256gb SSD :/ )\nThanks!\n\nA: You can't easily interrupt the download or the check for enough space with a toggle or a setting. Much easier would be to use a second drive to add capacity. If you don't like moving files off the SSD, just install OS X onto the external drive and keep space there for overflow files and new app downloads. A 32 GB SD card or fast thumb drive would let you install a minimal OS and have 20+ GB free for app installs and other storage needs you can't accommodate on your main storage. \n\nThe downside to installing a second OS is you have to shut down the primary and select the secondary and now you have two OS to patch. This only works if you really can't free up space on the main SSD. \nIf Apple implements app gifting like it does on the iOS and iTunes stores, then you could gift a paid purchase to yourself without needing the download to commence when the sale is made. \nSimilarly, setting up a volume purchase account would also let you \"purchase\" apps from the web interface and not from the App Store interface. It's unlikely any of this is easier than freeing up space on the OS you run or bringing a new OS with enough space to your Mac.\n\nA: I know this was marked as answered quite some time ago but I found a very simple method was to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect an external hard drive with plenty of free space\n\n*Purchase and begin download but then just disconnect your internet connection. The download fails but the purchase is already made and you can download later when ready.\nIt's not an optimal method for obvious reasons but got the job done.\n", "Q: Sharing & Permissions has 2 \"everyone\" entries, OS X 10.10.5 I was doing some stuff with the system administrator to my computer and we are not sure what we did to have this happen but we now have 2 everyone permissions in  nearly every file on my compute.

It's quite awkward to constantly move my hand from the mouse to the keyboard for one keypress every 20 seconds or so.\nIs this possible?\nEDIT\nNot Virtual Keyboard or Mouse Keys.\n\nA: Something like BetterTouchTool can be used for this purpose. You can configure gestures and actions that trigger keyboard shortcuts.

On my old one, I generated an ssh key pair many years ago, and I have configured that key on several sites, some of which I don't have direct control over. After I set up my keypair, I used ssh-add to import the cert into my keychain so I wouldn't have to type the passphrase every time. This worked fine.\nNow that I am migrating to a new Mac, I am trying to import my id_rsa key on my new mac, but it's asking me for a passphrase that I apparently do not remember.  I feel like that passphrase must be stored in the keychain of my old mac (which I still have), but I haven't figured out which of the entries in my old keychain is my id_rsa cert (we use S/MIME encrypted e-mail at work and the cert expire frequently, so I have quite a few certs in there).\nSo -- is there a way for me to either view the passphrase of my id_rsa cert in Keychain Access (after I unlock it with my system password), or to export my keypair from Keychain access in such a way that I can import it on my new Mac without having the original passphrase?\nThanks!\n\nA: There was a similar question on SuperUser here on SE.  \nIf you have still have access to your old Mac and you can successfully login into whatever services require your id_rsa cert with your passphrase saved in Keychain, you should be able to get the passphrase with no problem.  \nBasically, you should be able to see the passwords by selecting Show Password in Keychain.\nHave a look at this answer for details\n", "Q: AppleScript : Dim brightness below factory setting I want to dim the script below \"0\" on my iMac.\nHere is my current script, but this stick to OSX settings.\ntry\n    tell application \"System Preferences\"\n        reveal anchor \"displaysDisplayTab\" of pane id \"com.apple.preference.displays\"\n        delay 8\n        tell application \"System Events\"\n            set value of slider 1 of group 1 of tab group 1 of window 1 of process \"System Preferences\" to 0\n            delay 5\n        end tell\n    end tell\non error\n    display notification \"Dim screem down failed\"\nend try\n\nI found this app \"Shady\" which is going even below.\nThey have a link for the Open source on they Web site but 404.\nAny idea how to implement that with AppleScript?\n\nA: As was noted in the comments, brightness cannot go below a setting of 0. If you use the brightness keys on your mac, you'll note that if you keep going, you hit screen off, which entirely turns off the screen backlight. From experience, I would assume this is zero. Below zero would mean your screen is actively attracting light from it's surroundings. You can adjust some settings by 1/4th notches by holding the option key and pressing any of the adjustment buttons, but that's as close as you'll get. What shady is doing is merely darkening all of the colors on your screen, which does decrease brightness because of how well made lcds work, but I'm not sure if that's exactly what you're after, as that can definitely affect how colors look otherwise. EDIT: If 1/4 brightness increments are not enough, shady and those small increments should stack in effect, but some older macs can't dim their brightness in 1/4th increments after you get down to one notch.\n", "Q: Some contacts not displayed when searching for them I have an iPhone 6 with the newest iOS.\nToday a friend sent me a text message. After a few hours I went into\nmy contacts and tried searching for him but nothing came up even though I have him in contacts (checked by going into the message and clicking view contact).\nThis has actually happened several times before, searching for some contacts doesn't yield any result or shows something different even though that contact exists.\nAnyone had the experience with this?\n\nA: This can happen if you're using iCloud and it gets out of sync.  Go into Settings --> iCloud and turn off Contacts.  It will ask if you want to delete the contacts on your iPhone or keep them.  Choose to delete them from your iPhone.\nExit iCloud then go back into it.  Turn Contacts back on and allow it to sync your contacts back to your iPhone.  If everything worked ok, you should be able to find that person in your contacts again.\n\nA: If you are using iCloud it's good to go to www.icloud.com, sign in with your Apple ID and password, click the Contacts app on that web page, and see if the info there is better than on your iPhone. If it is, you can go ahead with the \"turn off contacts on your iPhone, turn them back on\" method. What you see at www.icloud.com is what Apple will sync to your device if you turn off contacts and then turn them back on so you want to be sure iCloud.com shows all of the contacts you expect.\n\nA: Okay, this is simple, but I missed it before fooling around with iCloud. In contacts, tap on groups, and be sure to check all groups. One of my email accounts was listed as a group, and had not been checked. \n", "Q: Does FileVault protect against ransomware? I've already asked a question about ransomware on OS X in general. But I failed to get a response regarding whether FileVault protects against it. That is what this question is about. I'm also interested to know whether encrypted Time Machine backups are safe from ransomware.\nRansomware here is defined as malicious software that encrypts the user's data against their will/knowledge and demands a ransom in exchange for the encryption key.\nWe'll look at three examples:\n\n\n*\n\n*The malware is running without superuser privileges. The unwitting user may just have ran a compromised/malicious app that they believed was something else, and then let it run in the background for long enough to do damage.\n\n*The malware is running with superuser privileges. The user, believing the software to be something else, has granted it root access by giving the root password. The user may even have installed the software by giving the root password.\n\n*The user didn't run any app at all, the malware managed to run in some other way. (Is this even possible on OS X?)\nIn cases 1 and 2 the user would have turned off OS X's \"trusted sources only\" setting. (Side question: Is it at all possible to be affected by ransomware while this setting is on?)\nLooking at 1., 2. and 3. separately, can the malware:\nA: Access FileVault protected data?\nB: Modify/Delete FileVault protected data?\nC: (A combination of A and B) Encrypt FileVault protected data and overwrite (securely delete) the original FileVault data)?\nIs there any difference between locally stored FileVault protected data, and encrypted Time Machine backups stored on another drive? I'm also interested in the answer regarding the latter.\n\nA: Ransomware works by selecting certain files (normally by type - like docs, bitcoin wallets, etc), encrypting those individual files and forcing you to pay up for a key to decrypt them.\nFileVault protects your data on your Mac by encrypting the whole disk. When you boot up your Mac, you put in a password that effectively \"decrypts\" the drive and allows it to run as-is. That said, once you've put the key in the lock, so to speak, FileVault wouldn't be protecting you from ransomware. You'd still be just as vulnerable as the ransomware would be running after FileVault had been unlocked.\nAs for the Time Machine backups, this is more complicated. Those backups are stored encrypted at rest, and only decrypted when they're accessed. This means the files inside the backups themselves would not be individually identifiable to ransomware that was running - however the entire backup could be. So the ransomware could encrypt the whole thing as a unit, instead of just the individual files.\nAs for OSX's \"trusted sources\" setting, there have been multiple exploits against this feature as of late and it's not as trustworthy as it seems. I couldn't say for certain it wouldn't protect you, but I wouldn't count on it.\nI'd recommend some kind of cloud-based or off-computer backup if you really want to protect your data running through a third party application. In other words, don't connect to a network share and backup your data there, use an application to do it. It's unlikely that ransomware would be sophisticated and specific enough to know about specific backup applications, how they connect to their third party service, and how to encrypt the files on that service. Dropbox is a simple example here if you pay for their cloud backup service -- even if the ransomware did encrypt your files in Dropbox, they keep versions backed up so you'd have something to revert to.\n\nA: A macOS feature that can help against ransomware is System Integrity Protection (SIP). This feature is enable by default on new versions of macOS. SIP prevents changes to system files even if you are root. To disable this, you need to go into macOS Recovery (Reboot then Command + R) then select Utilities > Terminal. Once you are in Terminal, type    csrutil disable. To check the status,   csrutil status (you can check the status is macOS itself). To enable,   csrutil enable (you need to be in macOS Recovery). Note that in macOS Catalina (10.15 and up), system files are stored in a separate APFS Ready Only so even if SIP is disabled, you can't write to system files.\n", "Q: Always ask for password when mounting encrypted partition I have an external disk with partitions A and B. B is an encrypted HFS volume with as password. (Presented as \"Apple_CoreStorage\" or \"Logical Volume OS X Extended\").\nWhen I connect the drive, OS X asks for the password to the partition. If I unmount the partition, and mount it again, OS X does not ask for the password.\nI have to physically disconnect the drive and connect it again to make OS X ask for the password.\nIs there any way to require the password to be entered every single time the partition is mounted? (This is the way encrypted sparse images work, for example.)\n\nA: This is a flaw in the CoreStorage encryption system. When you first connect the physical disk, the volume is in state Locked. Once you enter the password, the volume becomes Unlocked. (you can actually see the state of your volume from diskutil list)\nThe problem is that CoreStorage does not lock a volume until it is physically removed from the system.\nMy theory is that the keys used to unlock the volume being stored within memory until the drive is ejected - although the volume may be unmounted and locked, the keys to unlock it remain within memory. Attempting to remount and unlock the partition just calls for the keys from memory instead of asking for the password.\n\nA: You should be able to reliably lock the disk (in fact these are two disks: one physical and one logical) by first ejecting the unlocked, encrypted volume and then ejecting the base disk containing the Logical Volume Group:\nUsually a mounted and unlocked diskutil listing looks like this:\n/dev/disk0 (internal, physical):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *68.7 GB    disk0\n   1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1\n   2:                  Apple_HFS Macintosh HD                 67.9 GB    disk0s2\n   3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s3\n/dev/disk1 (internal, physical):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *68.7 GB    disk1\n   1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk1s1\n   2:          Apple_CoreStorage Encrypted               68.4 GB    disk1s2\n   3:                 Apple_Boot Boot OS X               134.2 MB   disk1s3\n/dev/disk2 (internal, virtual):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:                  Apple_HFS Encrypted              +68.0 GB    disk2\n                                 Logical Volume on disk1s2\n                                 AFD60A02-82C4-46B8-B354-6D37E1AEB9CE\n                                 Unlocked Encrypted\n\nDisk0 is my system disk containing an unencrypted system volume on disk0s2. Disk2 is a logical disk representing the encrypted volume. Disk1s2 contains all Core Storage items representing a FileVault2 encrypted volume. Parts of the Core Storage items (the Logical Volume Family and the Logical Volume) are the \"logical\" disk2.\nIf you first eject disk2 and then disk1 by entering\ndiskutil eject disk2\ndiskutil eject disk1\n\nin Terminal.app the Logical Volume should be locked afterwards. This usually won't detach the disk physically (i.e. it's still visible in diskutil list). If you want to remount the disk afterwards simply enter:\ndiskutil mountDisk disk1\ndiskutil cs unlock lvUUID -passphrase passphrase\ndiskutil mount disk2\n\nIf your external disk is not self-powered or a thumb drive you may have to unload and reload a kext first:\nkextunload /System/Library/Extensions/IOUSBMassStorageClass.kext\n\nfollowed by:\nkextload /System/Library/Extensions/IOUSBMassStorageClass.kext\n\nto make the disk visible again in diskutil list.\n\nIf you have one internal disk and one external encrypted drive only this is scriptable with ease. You may either create bash script(s) or an Apple Script/Automator service.\nIf you have several external disks attached at the same time you have to detect and filter the various UUIDs and disk identifiers first.\n", "Q: Put computer to sleep and have it ask for password on wake How do I put computer to sleep and have it re-awake asking for a password?\nI'm looking for a terminal command to do this.\nI tried pmset sleepnow did not work.\n\nA: There are multiple answers to the question of how to programmatically enable 'Ask for password after sleep or screensaver' -- the option that appears in the Security preferences panel.\n\nOnce you've enabled that option, you can use the following command to run an AppleScript to sleep the computer:\nosascript -e 'tell application \"Finder\" to sleep'\n\n", "Q: Can I use a USB to HDMI converter to set up 2 external monitors on my 2015 Macbook Air? Can the Macbook Air (2015 model) power a second external monitor via it's USB port (using a USB to HDMI cable)? I would also need to connect an external keyboard and mouse, so I plan on getting a USB hub to extend the second USB port on my Air. Will this setup work? I remember reading an article which said that the MBA can power only 1 external monitor. Is there any truth to this? \n\nA: The MBA GPU may be limited to a single external monitor, but the USB to HDMI requires a driver installed on the MBA and that video/image is not using the GPU, it's using the CPU. So the limit is bypassed. Now it might be more complicated than this, but I think is this the basic premise. Be aware that for fast moving videos or games the USB connected display may disappoint. Also if the MBA is running near 100% CPU usage and then you add this USB display it may also disappoint.\nIf you looked to add more screen for email, YouTube it's likely to be fine.  The hub might be more of an issue, if the cable is USB 3 make sure the hubs too\n\nA: Yes and yes. Its GPU has limit of only one external monitor. But USB to HDMI adapters have its own simple GPU so you will need a driver installation.\nMain con is very limited resolution and screen refresh rate. Check adapter spec.\n", "Q: What does a star next to a song in the Music app in iOS indicate?

While listening to a song, tap the artwork.  From there you can give it 0-5 stars.  The stars will show-up next to the song, like in your image.\n", "Q: Calls and texts and iPhone appearing on iPad When somebody rings or texts my iPhone it is now also showing up on iPad when I'm at home. This is happening since we had internet installed at home, so whoever is on the iPad sees all the calls and messages.\n\nA: This is a feature in iOS since version 8. You can turn it off. On the iPhone, go to Settings/Phone/Allow Calls on Other Devices and turn it off entirely or just off in the \"Allow Calls On\" section at the bottom.

I suspect these default paths don't come from VeraCrypt, but rather are set somewhere in OS X itself.\nI ask because I'm trying to predict what other people's OS X installations will do, and I'm worried theirs are configured differently than mine.

If you have two identically named volumes, OSX will suffix 2-N with a digit in the filesystem (however, I don't believe they appear differently named on the desktop)\n\n*OSX mounts everything under /Volumes/.

I have had the problem of the machine automatically powering off (for no reason at all) since almost day 1. After trying everything, including having the local iCentre change almost every part, I am still struggling with this problem.\nOn the UPS display which I have attached to the same mains the iMac is attached to I have started noticing that the voltage input fluctuates between 230v and 237v (I believe that in our country the voltage should be 240v). Does anybody know if the iMac has an inbuilt mechanism to shut off automatically as a protection mechanism when voltage fluctuates?\nDid anyone encounter the same problem? Do you recommend any particular UPS / stabilizer?\nUpdate: My error message is 'Previous shutdown cause: 0'\n\nA: Voltage fluctuations are normal.  I am assuming you are in the UK or Europe.  If so, your voltage should be between 220V and 240V so everything is within range.  Besides, the UPS is designed to \"smooth out\" these voltage fluctuations so your power is clean coming into your Mac.\nWhat is key to finding out what your issue is what the shutdown code is in your system log.  \nIn Terminal, type the following command and paste the output to your question\nsyslog | grep shutdown\nYou should get something like \"Previous shutdown cause: X\"\nBased on your error message as \"Previous shutdown cause: 0\" means there was a power loss.\n\nYou said that you have a UPS; it's very easy to test whether it is working or not:  just unplug it from the wall while your Mac is powered.  If it continues to run, your UPS is good.  For the record, I doubt it's your UPS because you would know if you were having power outages, but it's always good to test.\nOnce you have confirmed your UPS, take a look at this post:  iMac randomly shuts down  I believe it will answer your question as to why your iMac is powering off; basically your iMac's power supply failing.\n", "Q: Use spotlight (or Alfred) to open an existing chrome tab I want to easily jump to gmail as one of many (many, many) open tabs in Chrome.\nIf I could just type \"gmail\" into Spotlight and it would take me to that tab in Chrome, that would work great for me. Or if there was a way to get gmail in the top-level Cmd+Tab list, that'd work too. Anyone know a way to do this?\nOn Windows, I made gmail its own \"app\", because Chrome lets you do that in Windows. That means that Alt+Tab can bring you directly to gmail, ignoring other Chrome windows. Unfortunately, Chrome for Mac doesn't allow making web pages into apps, so that route doesn't work. (I used https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/app-launcher-for-gmail/mlbjackfgfafcnpfaanflcjoknkhofnh for a time, and it worked ok [but didn't have my Chrome extensions, like Boomerang], but lately it's been busted.)\nI use Vimium and its Vomnibar is like spotlight, but you have to first focus chrome and then be on a page on which you haven't disabled Vimium (e.g. I disable Vimium for google docs and similar rich apps), so it's not ideal either.\n\nA: There is a workaround that I use. And it's not that hard. It's called \"Nativefier\". \n\nNativefier is a command line tool that allows you to easily create a desktop application for any web site with succinct and minimal configuration. Apps are wrapped by Electron in an OS executable (.app, .exe, etc.) for use on Windows, OSX and Linux.\n\nSo what this means is that you can create a app(that can be added to you're dock) for one webpage in Chrome for example. So you can easily use Cmd+Tab to switch apps. You just need a bit of 'command line' experience to achieve all this.\nFull tutorial can be found here; https://www.npmjs.com/package/nativefier\n", "Q: OS X attempting to connect to non-existent server My wife's Mac is acting up and I've been trying to sort it out for a while with no success.\nAnytime she opens a new Finder window, tries to upload an image to Facebook, exports an image from Lightroom, or does any other file related task.

I've searched up this and I can't seem to find anything. \nWhat is he doing and how can I stop him?\n\nA: He isn't actually hacking into your iMessage at all. Group messages can be a little strange in the way they work. When you remove someone from a group thread there is no way for them to know unless you specifically notify them. It does not show them that they were removed nor does it delete the thread. As such, the other party in your case is likely carrying on business as usual by messaging the group thread that you thought to removed him from. Here's the catch: you did remove him but when he messages the old group it creates a new group thread that looks identical to the one you removed him from. Then, when you remove him again, it goes back to the other thread and he can not see updates. \nAs such, to resolve your problem, use two, unique group thread names. If you tap \"Details\" in the upper right, and scroll up a little you will see a field to name the group. Find the one he is part of and the one he is not part of and then name them differently. Then inform the others on the thread he is not on to use [thread name] for messaging not [thread name with unwanted user]. \nFinally, if you want no correspondence from the unwanted guest, you can block him, but that will sever all communications. Moreover, you will not receive any of his messages yet the other members of your group chat will if they haven’t blocked him.\n", "Q: Does turning iMessage off remove previous iMessages and text messages?

(My Mac which is it plugged into via USB, and my iPhone 6S). \nAfter I unplug the USB from the Macbook, the devices that connected to the iPad via wifi can still maintain the connection, but it is no longer discoverable on wifi. (And if I restart the iPhone it remains paired). \nMy question is: How do I make my iPad Retina wifi hotspot discoverable (tethering 3G) when off and unplugged like my iPhone 6S?\n\nA: You'd have to be on the Personal Hotspot menu from Settings.

However you can 'forget' any wifi network which will delete it from the list and you can not know which of the networks was accessed when or from which of the devices.\nIf you delete your call history then it is deleted forever. This goes the same for Whatsapp or facetime.\nIf you have old complete backups of the phone made after the calls were made but after they were deleted then you can use that to get the history.\n", "Q: Did I mess up my .profile file? I was trying to update my system path, followed some directions online and accidentally types:\ntouch ~/.profile\n\nDid I overwrite my .profile file? Does this mean that I have destroyed all of my PATH information? If so, how do I fix this?\n\nA: The short answer is \"no\".\nThe touch command does not modify the data in a file at all. Its effects on a file are:\n\n\n*\n\n*If the file does not exist it is created\n\n*If the file exists if sets its access time metadata to the current time\n\n\nThere are some more options but in this case they are irrelevant, you can see the whole documentation by typing man touch in the terminal.\nSo, no worries, your .profile file was not modified.\n\nA: I see that you are on OSX which doesn't have a ~/.profile file by default.

The SSD is either damaged or has to be reseated, if it doesn't show up entering diskutil list or if it shows up: the internal structure of the LVG got corrupted.\nA Fusion Drive works similar as a RAID0: 2 (or more) disks occur as one: The whole file system spans over two or more disks. One big difference of a Fusion Drive is that files often aren't sliced and therefore either reside on the SSD or the HDD. Depending on the file type and the access frequency or last access time the \"less important\" files are relocated to the HDD part. The file system files (e.g. catalog file) and most system files usually reside on the SSD part.\nYou may try to dd disk0s2 to an external drive (either as partition or as raw file to an existing volume) and inspect it with a decent file recovery tool. If you enabled FileVault previously the data can't be recovered.\nRewriting the GPT (or MBR) doesn't help at all or on the contrary: it makes things worse.\n\nIf you have further questions leave a comment.\n", "Q: Where did the info at the bottom of the Finder window go?

A very welcome change indeed! (Not sure which version it was implemented in) You can do it by going to \"More\" tab on Viber, and opening Settings -> Notifications, and turn off \"In-App vibrations\". See the official Viber documentation here. Excerpt:\n\nIn-App Vibrate\nWhen this option is enabled, you will receive a vibration for every incoming notification.\n\n\nA: It's my understanding that you can't turn off specific vibration notifications in Viber; that's just how the application is built.  I've seen messages on the Apple discussion boards with people complaining about this from almost 3 years ago.\nTo turn off all notifications for Viber, go into Settings --> Notifications --> Viber.  Switch the Allow notifications to off.  This will disable all notifications for Viber at the iPhone level.\n", "Q: Can I work on iMovie online?: ie upload a library to googledrive or etc and work on it from any Mac? I will be traveling without my Mac, but need to continue my editing. Can I edit using iMovie online? I would want to upload an entire (huge) library to googledrive or etc and work on it from any Mac, maybe in a desktop-rental place. \nIf that is not possible: can I save a project online and then download it to use in my library? \nFor example, I would take along a Mac, but I don't want to chance losing the edited versions if the Mac and any external HDs I bring along are stolen/damaged. If I don't need to import new events (nor move events, nor projects from event to event) while editing, can I save the newly-edited projects online somehow, so that even if all is stolen I can have the edited project back when I return home and re-connect any Mac to the backup HD with the iMovie library on it, so that iMovie will load with the project I had edited while travelling?\n\nA: I'd recommend Dropbox. You'd be able to edit files locally with Dropbox, and then it would handle syncing them to the cloud. You'd just have to make sure you left your computer on long enough to allow it to finish syncing after you made changes.\nI'm unsure if Google Drive works the same way - but I use Dropbox for something very similar to your scenario and it works great. I can edit files at home or at the office, and they sync across so I don't have to worry about transporting things back and forth.\n", "Q: How to disable Swapfile in OS X El Capitan I've tried these commands in OS X El Capitan, but it doesn't work:\n$ sudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.dynamic_pager.plist\n\n$ sudo rm /private/var/vm/swapfile*\n\n$ sysctl vm.swapusage\nvm.swapusage: total = 2048.00M  used = 596.00M  free = 1452.00M  (encrypted)\n\nI have 16GB of RAM and 256GB SSD, I just don't want the SSD to tear down faster just because I enable the swapfile.\n\nA: El Capitan has its System Integrity Protection system, which you must disable before you can touch some OS inner workings, such as swap.\nYou'll need to reboot your Mac in Recovery Mode (holding Command+R at boot time). Open Terminal as root, then disable System Integrity with:\ncsrutil disable\n\nNow you can disable swap.\nAfter all done, you should enable System Integrity again using:\ncsrutil enable\n\n", "Q: Are purchasing items through apps against the rules of the App Store? From the App Store's Review Guidelines:\n\nApps using IAP to purchase physical goods or goods and services used outside of the App will be rejected\n\nSo, what that statement really mean? Does it mean that purchasing apps, like clients for online stores are not accepted? If this is true, why applications like Amazon and eBay are available in the App Store?\n\nA: Amazon and eBay are not using In-App Purchases (IAP) to purchase their products.  For instance, I have an app that allows an IAP for users to access other features of the app.  The purchases are made in the app for something that is part of the app and the users are able to pay via iTunes/AppStore payment process.\nAmazon and eBay allow you to make purchases thru their apps but they're not done for things like 'no advertising' or 'add social media access'.  They're for goods and services that are not being made thru the Apple-provided buying medium, iTunes or the App Store.  So these purchases are not IAP purchases.\n", "Q: MS Word 2016 Turn Off Formatting Marks I'm no longer able to control the visibility of formatting marks in MS Word documents using the \"paragraph\" button on the top menu/ribbon.  I'm unable to locate an override setting that specifies to always display formatting marks.  Is anyone familiar with how to remedy this issue?\n\n\nA: Go to Preferences → View and disable Paragraph marks. This option, when enabled, overrides the button on the ribbon. Disable it to control the marks using the ribbon button.\n     \n\nA: I'd suggest trying Step 2 of these troubleshooting steps. Basically my guess is you have a corrupted preference file. By removing your preferences files hopefully it resolves your issue.\nIf that doesn't work, following all those steps will completely remove it. I'd recommend that as a second solution.\nEDIT: Original poster specified Office 2016. Same basic answer applies, however the instructions are here instead.\n\nA: Another possibility is that the individual marks are listed as \"always shown\" under Word options→Display→Always show these formatting marks on the screen.\n(This is where the option is located in WinWord; hopefully the Apple equivalent is not so different)\n", "Q: How to ensure connections to certain hosts are routed via ethernet? We have a mac that acts as a CI-server. \nIt needs to connect to our git-repositories which can only be connected to via ethernet. \nAll other servers, apple.com, github.com, etc. need to be connected via wifi, because our ethernet is running a MITM-scheme for all SSL-connections.\nI thought about setting routes manually, routing certain IPs to specific gateways. However, the IPs themselves are changing, too. \nSo to connect to our git repo, at any time, I would have to do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Turn off wireless adapter\n\n*Resolve ip of git server using nameserver in ethernet network\n\n*Turn on wireless adapter\n\n*Add static route \n\n\nIs this correct?\nIs there a better way to do it? Perhaps with some UI-tool?\n\nA: Use VLANs. Put your wifi on one VLAN, and your internal network on another VLAN. Don't allow wifi users to access the internal VLAN, and make sure hard wired connections are on the internal VLAN.\nThis lets your switch/router handle the job, instead of setting up individual routes on employee machines.\n", "Q: Should I format my iMac? I have an iMac 27inch from 2009 running El Capitain at work. It was used by other people before I came in working for this company. It seems a bit on the slow side comparing to my home PC. Would formatting it help? (it has a bunch of applications)\n\nA: If you are new to Mac, the first thing is prepare:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make a Time Machine full backup to a drive over USB locally.\n\n*See if the Mac boots to recovery - hold Command + R when it starts\n\n\nAssuming you have both the above, you can wipe and see what a clean Mac looks like. The internet download of the installer is 5 GB or so and the wipe / install should take less than 30 minutes once the download is done.\nAt that point you can see if you are missing apps and worst case - restore from the backup as if you didn't wipe in the first place - only using time.\nYou probably don't need to wipe to analyze the performance, but it could help clean up any oddball installations like third party flash / malware / odd browsers and old software you don't need running. A clean start is great to time the things you care about and then see if the system slows down over time.\n", "Q: Parallels 7 after El Capitan update I have Parallels 7 on my Macbook Pro. I just installed El Capitan onto my Macbook and now I can't open Parallels. What do I need to do?\n\nA: You're going to have to upgrade to Parallels 10 or Parallels 11. See this Parallels knowledgeable article: Parallels Desktop and Mac OS (Host) compatibility\nThere is a free trial demo of Parallels 11. So you may be able to convert your old Parallels 7 file in advance of paying for it.\nNext time you update OS X be sure to check its compatibility with the version of Parallels you're running. Parallels is a program that often breaks with an OS X update. \n", "Q: iTunes local backup of iOS device: can't disable encryption I have a strange problem with iTunes local backup of an iOS device (an iPod, in this case).\nI know I've backed up the iPod to my computer before, but iTunes states, \"Latest Backup: Your iPod has never been backed up to this computer.\"  The last local backup was a long time ago, under older versions of iTunes and OS X.  Maybe the current version of iTunes doesn't entirely recognize the old settings.\nThe iPod's backup settings in iTunes had \"iCloud\" selected.  I know whatever backup is in iCloud is very old and incomplete, since I didn't have space there to complete the backup.  Although \"iCloud\" was selected, the \"Encrypt local backup\" option is checked under \"This computer\" (which wasn't selected).\nI want to change to local backup, but I don't remember what password I might have set when I used that option before.  I tried using the \"Change password...\" button to change it, but since I can't remember the current password, I can't specify a new one.  I've also tried disabling the \"Encrypt local backup\" with the idea of enabling it again later, just before the backup.  However, disabling that also prompts me for the password which I can't remember.\nI've tried various passwords I've used before, including my current and recent ones for my OS X account.  I've tried my current and recent AppleID passwords, and my iPod's current and recent 4-digit passcodes.  None of them worked.\nThe \"Devices\" panel of iTunes preferences doesn't list any device backups.  The ~/Library/Application Support/MobileSync/Backup folder is empty, too.\nSince my computer doesn't seem to have any backups on it, I'd like to get iTunes to think that a password hasn't been set for encrypting local backups.  I've already checked Keychain Access and it doesn't have any passwords set for \"backup\" or any variations of my iPod's name.\nDoes anybody have ideas of how I can get iTunes to forget about the old settings for encrypting local backups?\n\nA: Look in Utilities/Keychain to see if the backup password is there\n", "Q: How can I display the SSID I am connected to in the Menu extensions area? I'd like to also display the SSID I am currently connected to next to the WiFi signal strength indicator.\nRunning El Capitan (10.11.4)\n\nA: *\n\n*Download Debookee Tools from the Mac App Store and launch it.\n\n*Click it on the menu bar for its dropdown and uncheck Channel and Debookee Icon, and check Launch at Login.\n\n*Change the location by command-dragging each menu bar item where you want them.\nSSD is now always displayed in the menu bar!\n\nA: You can do this with Hammerspoon (see http://hammerspoon.org) and a bit of lua. Add the following to Hammerspoon's config file. Don't forget to save and do 'reload config' from the Hammerspoon menu bar icon:\nwifiMenu = hs.menubar.newWithPriority(2147483645)\nwifiMenu:setTitle(hs.wifi.currentNetwork())\n\nwifiWatcher = nil\n\nfunction ssidChanged()\n    local wifiName = hs.wifi.currentNetwork()\n    if wifiName then\n        wifiMenu:setTitle(wifiName)\n    else \n        wifiMenu:setTitle(\"Wifi OFF\")\n    end\nend\n\nwifiWatcher = hs.wifi.watcher.new(ssidChanged):start()\n\nHaven't tested it on Sierra, but works nicely on 10.11.6.\n\nA: The best solution I use for adding the SSID to the menu bar is turning off Apple's menu item and using WiFi Signal app from Adrian Granados:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://www.adriangranados.com/?q=apps/wifi-signal\n\n*https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wifi-signal/id525912054?mt=12\nIt's much fuller featured than just displaying the SSID, but it does that job nicely. I am a very satisfied customer of all his Mac apps as they are powerful, well engineered and updated regularly.\n\nA: There's no built-in way to show the wifi SSID in the menu bar.  However, you do have a few other options.\nYou can buy a 3rd-party application like Bartender 2 that allows you to move items around and show/hide icons.  While not exactly what you're looking for it does supply some more detailed level of customization.\nOr, you can option+click the wifi icon to see a dropdown menu of additional info, including the SSID name.\n\nA: The most configurable menubar display app I'm aware of right now is TextBar ($2.99 U.S.).\nhttp://www.richsomerfield.com/apps/\n\nA: Simple use Debookee Tools.

The Chrome browser has Flash bundled, however.  So I'd like to have domains that I know require Flash always open in Chrome, but everything else open in my preferred browser, which is Safari.\nI'm okay with maintaining a \"white list\" of which sites need the \"use chrome\" exception, but right now I can't see any way to make it happen.\nAny suggestions?\n\nA: Try to use Choosy\nIt can prompt you to select from the browsers on your Mac so you can decide which browser is right for a particular link.\n:)\n\nA: If you would rather use a free and open source app you can use Finicky.\nDon't be intimidated by writing a configuration file for Finicky! If you need help you can use Finicky Kickstart to do the heavy lifting.\n", "Q: Why does OS X repeatedly prompt for certificate trust when joining WPA2 Enterprise WiFi WHY does OS X always prompt for certificate trust when connecting to WPA2 Enterprise (EAP-PEAP in my case) networks, even if the certificate is already marked as 'trusted'?\nEven weirder.. if I delete the cert from keychain access, then click 'Continue' to the first cert prompt, but the click 'Cancel' on the elevation credentials window.. I am somehow still able to connect to the WiFi network...\n\n\n\nA: I had the same issue and my solution was to change the access control on the certificate's private key to not require confirmation. Go to My Certificates, expand your certificate, and open the private key settings. You could probably be more selective and just allow whatever \"application\" handles WiFi, but in my case it wasn't necessary. \n\n\nA: I believe what's happening is that macOS needs access to the private key of the client certificate that EAP TLS is requesting.  As has been suggested, find the client certificate in Keychain Access (if the prompt you get states that it is trying to access the \"System\" keychain, then search in the System keychain).\nBeside the certificate there will be an arrow that allows you to expand the hierarchy, exposing the private key associated with the certificate.  Expand then double-click on the key.  Select Access Control.\nNow if you're like me and you don't want to allow all applications to access this key, you'll need to select the eapolclient.

Unfortunately, as of El Capitan, this functionality has been removed and is only accessible via Terminal by default. This has left me with a bit of a cyclical problem. \nAs an alternative, I have tried repairing permissions with Onyx, however this simply freezes midway through the process.\nI'm not sure if this is related but I'm also unable to download an OS X El Capitan (10.11.4) update from the Mac App Store - I click update, click Download & Restart from the dropdown, it says \"0 bytes of 1.56 GB - Calculating...\" then nothing happens and the Update button reappears. I've read that OS X has started trying to repair permissions during updates which is why I suspect this may be related.\nI've made a few efforts to use the repair permissions terminal command from Recovery Mode however Terminal has told me that it doesn't recognise the command - perhaps I'm doing something wrong here. \nPlease let me know if anyone has come across this issue before or has any advice - thanks very much!\n\nA: I had the same problem with my dev machine.

I notice in iOS, often times when I open an app, such as YouTube, the first thing that it shows is a screenshot of that app from one of the more recent things I was doing with the app. \nWhen I multitask back to the app, the OS loads these images before the app is fully running and able to process input.\nBut it strikes me as useless, since the buttons on the app don't even function at that stage, and it even does this for apps that don't fully restore state so you see it go back to a main screen after showing you what you were doing in the app before. It's also a security concern because I could be writing in a password-protected note or something and it shows up briefly when opening the app, or an old YouTube video screenshot could show up when I'm opening the app.\nHow can this \"featured\" be turned off in iOS.\n\nA: There's no global switch in iOS 9 or earlier. The app developers can decide, what the app show during loading. \nIf you see security issues or just feel that the experience using this feature is poor, the only remedy today is to contact the developer. Many professional apps like 1Password and Apple notes are coded to not disclose secure information in a temporary app image. \nAnother option would to be to send feedback to Apple or a bug report detailing any lapses or explaining how this should be an optional control. Apple could change this in future OS if a case were made well enough or by enough people.\n", "Q: Accessing a local IIS server in a VM on a Mac from an iOS device for testing I have a Windows 10 install running in a Parallels VM on 2009 Mac Pro running OS X 10.11 and I want to access the IIS server in the VM for testing on iOS. I can reach website running in the VM from OS X without issue, but when I try and access it through an iOS device through an ad-hoc network or through the same wifi network it doesn't respond, but I am able to access websites hosted in OS X on the iOS device.\nI don't want to use a third party solution, I just want local access that I can control. Has anyone been able to make this work?\n\nA: Change your network setting in parallels to be bridge mode and you should be set. \n\n\n*\n\n*http://kb.parallels.com/en/4948\nThe IIS and Windows will get their own IP address so you can connect as if the PC was a physical one connected directly to the network. The Mac won't see the traffic to the server process. \n", "Q: Workflow/tools for installing command line application on OS X (Yosemite or later) I maintain a set of command line bioinformatics tools which we distribute as source and binaries for Linux, Windows, and OS X. Currently the binary distribution for OS X is just a zip file containing directories for the binaries and the documentation. Our install guide directs the user to unzip the archive, copy the binaries to the desired location, and update their PATH to point to the binaries. That's fine for the command line savvy users, but some users have never  heard of /usr/local/bin let alone PATH. We'd love to have an installer that's in more of the OS X idiom.\nCreating an application bundle doesn't seem to do the trick because our tools are strictly command line and they'll need a terminal session to use them. It seems like we could have used PackageMaker to create an installer, but that's now deprecated.\nIs there a current standard installer for command line tools on OS X, preferably one with CPACK support?\n\nA: The standard package format is the \"pkg\" format. It's not often used for applications, but it's fine for a terminal-only utility.\n\n\n*\n\n*My go-to tool for creating packages is called Packages.\n\n*I haven't used it myself, but it looks like CMake supports PackageMaker, which is a third party tool for creating OS X packages.\n\n*There's also the built-in pkgbuild utility. \n\n\nJust make sure you don't touch anything outside the standard paths (/Library, /Applications, or /usr/local/) and you'll be fine.\n\nA: You may want to have a look at EPM, the Easy Package Manager.\nIt can package Mac OS X pkg as well as RedHat RPM, Debian deb and then some more package formats -- all from the same source files, immediately after the build step.\nIt was originally written by Michael Sweet, the author of CUPS (who now works for Apple), and is still maintained by him.\nThe documentation is here:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.msweet.org/documentation/project2/EPM.html\nEPM is available via MacPorts (albeit in an older version, v4.1, whereas the current one is v4.3).\nTo use it in your Makefile, it is as easy as adding an additional target like this:\nosx:\n    epm -f osx -v -s doc/epmlogo.tif $(MY_PROJECT) \n\n\nOf course, you can also use it standalone (not from the Makefile) to package your software. \nIt requires you to create a list of files with their paths, permissions and some other meta info which should be packaged.\n", "Q: Does deleting my backup on my iPhone give me more space? I'm running out of space on my iCloud and my storage in general. If I delete my backup, will I gain more space for pictures? \n\nA: If you disable/delete iCloud backups of your iOS device, it will indeed free up space in your iCloud account. This only means you will have more space available in the cloud, not on the actual device. \nIf you have iCloud Photo Library enabled, note that your iCloud backups will not include that media since it’s already being uploaded to the cloud.\nTo free up space on your actual iOS device (again, assuming iCloud Photo Library is enabled), make sure that Settings > iCloud > Photos > Optimize Storage is selected.\n\nA: Yes. Definitely it will. An easy way to free up a lot of space in iCloud for your pictures is to delete backups. If your iCloud storage is still almost full, maybe other cloud services are good for you. However, you should know that this is only for you to have more space on iCloud not your own devices.\n", "Q: How to rename a USB stick using disk number (via terminal and using diskutil)? I'm creating a bash script that will rename the USB stick using a diskutil command. From what I've read in the man and various examples, I need to supply the volume name.\nIn my situation, the volume name varies so I'm hoping to use disk number (via diskutil list) instead.\nAny ideas on how this can be done?\n\nA: When you insert a USB drive it automatically gets mounted.  You can see the name of the device using the mount command:\n$ mount\n/dev/disk2 on / (hfs, local, journaled)\ndevfs on /dev (devfs, local, nobrowse)\nmap -hosts on /net (autofs, nosuid, automounted, nobrowse)\nmap auto_home on /home (autofs, automounted, nobrowse)\n/dev/disk7s1 on /Volumes/USB-NAME (msdos, local, nodev, nosuid, noowners)\n\nMaking the simplifying assumption that you only have one usb drive mounted at a time and it is always formatted with windows, you can then rename the drive like this:\n$ diskutil rename $(mount | sed -n '/Volumes.*msdos/{ s/ .*//;p;}') NEW-NAME\nVolume on disk7s1 renamed to NEW-NAME\n\nnow when you look at the mount output, the name is changed:\n$ mount | grep '/Volumes.*msdos'\n/dev/disk7s1 on /Volumes/NEW-NAME (msdos, local, nodev, nosuid, noowners)\n\nYou may need to adjust the search parameters based on different assumptions, but this is the general idea.\n", "Q: curl not working in El Capitan I receive this error message when trying to run curl from the terminal command line:\n\n/usr/local/bin/curl: line 61: /usr/local/bin/sed: No such file or directory\n  /usr/local/bin/curl: line 65: /usr/local/bin/sed: No such file or directory\n  /usr/local/bin/curl: error: `/Users/xxxxx/.libs/curl' does not exist\n  This script is just a wrapper for curl.\n\ncurl used to work on Yosemite but it has been awhile since I used it.

My situation: I have a \"late '08 aluminum\" Intel 64-bit MacBook, still have Snow Leopard installed, and XP via Bootcamp, all on the original hard-drive. Yes, it's my \"legacy\" setup. The HD is 7 years old, and every time I move the computer and the HD makes that clicking \"disengage\" sound for impact protection, I cringe a little bit.\nWhat I want to do: I want to put in a new Intel SSD with the latest OS (Mavericks, Capitan, heck even Mountain Lion, whatever will work in my situation), and put the old HDD in a drawer. I want the ability to swap in my old HDD to use Snow Leopard/XP without any difficulties. I don't want to jeopardize backwards-compatibility with Snow Leopard at the bootloader or EFI level. I am worried that Mavericks, Capitan, etc. will go all crazy and re-wire the whole EFI, because Snow Leopard was the last version to use a 32-bit kernel, even though my Mac has a 64-bit Intel processor. (Source)\nExtra info: I have never turned on FileVault, Time Machine, or signed in with an Apple ID on the current installation, but plan to use Apple ID on the new one. -- Model Identifier: MacBook5,1 -- Boot ROM Version:  MB51.007D.B03 -- SMC Version (system): 1.32f8\nWhat I have questions about:\n\n\n*\n\n*Which OSX version, if any, can I upgrade to without jeopardizing my old setup? So if I swapped in my old hard-drive, Snow Leopard and XP will boot as if nothing happened?\n\n*Once EFI firmware is updated to work with the latest OSX, is it backwards compatible with older versions by means of swapping in an old HD? I also know OSX has some form of Keychain security, but is it used in the booting process? I will use the same local username/password.\n\n*Does signing in with Apple ID on Mavericks/Capitan/Yosemite lock the EFI to that specific OS installation? Like an anti-theft kind of deal? I know Apple is big about security...\n\nThanks in advance for any expert advice in this situation!\n\nA: Since I am currently using a 20-inch, Mid 2007 iMac, I am somewhat familiar with upgrades. When I installed Snow Leopard, it ran as a 64 bit operating system. I have installed every version of OS X since Snow Leopard without any problems. I am currently running both Yosemite and El Capitan. I have run Vista 32 bit, Windows 7, 8, 8.1 and 10 64 bit, even though Apple only officially supports up to Windows 7 32 bit on my iMac. \nAccording to the site: OS X El Capitan - Technical Specifications, you can run El Capitan on your Mac. I assume then, you could also install an older version of OS X. Of course, finding one to download might be a problem.\nYour question:\n\nWhich OSX version, if any, can I upgrade to without jeopardizing my old setup? So if I swapped in my old hard-drive, Snow Leopard will be accessible and boot as if nothing happened?\n\nAny OS X newer that Snow Leopard. You could even move your Snow Leopard to the new SSD and install another OS X version.\nYour question\n\nOnce EFI firmware is updated to work with the latest OSX, is it backwards compatible with older versions by means of swapping in an old HD? I also know OSX has some form of Keychain security, but is it used in the booting process? I will use the same local username/password.\n\nPeople often return you computer's OS X to factory conditions. Whether this means using a DVD that came with your Mac or downloading from the internet, I do not think any Firmware upgrade would disable your ability to do this. In other words, Firmware upgrades should not prevent Snow Leopard from running on your Mac. \nYour question:\n\nDoes signing in with Apple ID on Mavericks/Capitan/Yosemite lock the EFI to that specific OS installation? Like an anti-theft kind of deal? I know Apple is big about security...\n\nNo. I currently have two versions of OS X installed. Your Apple ID has nothing to do with the EFI.\n\nA: Your plan seems solid. You should be able to just swap your HDD with a SSD and install the most recent OS version. But I would recommend to download the installer for 10.11 from the App Store first and make an USB installer. How do you do this is explained here in detail or in short use this terminal command with an 8GB USB stick plugged in.\nsudo /Applications/Install\\ OS\\ X\\ El\\ Capitan.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/ElCapInstaller --applicationpath /Applications/Install\\ OS\\ X\\ El\\ Capitan.app --nointeraction\n\nEven with a new OS, you will be able to boot the old MacOS partition. About the Bootcamp partition I am unsure.\n\nA: I'd recommend putting your old drive in a USB enclosure. Then, you could simply hold option on boot and boot off of this old drive without issue.\nThis would save you the effort of having to take the computer apart every time you'd like to boot off of the old operating system -- and this won't have any impact on your newer drive and OS. It'll even make it accessible in the older booted OS if you need files from it.\n", "Q: iPhone has stopped updating apps automatically I have to open the App Store and tap Update to keep all of the apps up to date. There is always a big list of apps waiting to be updated, which takes quite a while to complete. This issue seems to have started around the release of iOS 9.\n\n\n*\n\n*The option for Automatic Downloads is ticket under Settings > iTunes & App Stores;\n\n*Connecting to Wi-Fi has not resolved the issue;\n\n*The instructions displayed on Apple’s support page has not resolved the issue;\n\n*Reset All Settings has not resolved the issue.\n\n\nThere seem to be countless of people with this issue if you search the Internet. Unfortunately, none of the suggested resolutions by users have helped in my case. Could Erase All Content and Settings really be the only way to resolve this issue?\n\nA: As I was in the middle of relocating, I had updated my country amongst other personal information in my Apple ID. It appears installed apps stop updating until you reinstall them from the App Store for the new country even if the app is available under the very same name. You will be informed App Store switches country upon opening App Store for the first time after updating country in your Apple ID.\nI have rung Apple about this issue, and they did not have much of a solution other than reinstalling the apps.\nYou could switch back to your old address to have automatic updates resume, but keep in mind your new ‘foreign’ payment details (ie credit cards) will not be accepted. At the time, I was told there is no way around this. I hope Apple changes this policy in the future as it is the only service which does not accept my foreign issued Mastercard to this day.\n\nA: Auto app update works only when the iPhone is plugged in to power.\n\nA: The comment above makes some sense. My auto-update seemed to not be working since I switched to wireless charging. If I plug it in AND have it on wifi it does the auto-updates.\n", "Q: Brew doctor complains about 2 unbrewed dylibs (possibly remnants from Samsung Sidesync) I've just found that brew doctor gives me the following error :\nPlease note that these warnings are just used to help the Homebrew maintainers\nwith debugging if you file an issue.

Package managers will complain if there are files installed in the area they manage. So with Homebrew only Homebrew installed files should be in /usr/local\nIn this case I would guess from the names the first is definitely from Sidesync but the second could also be used by others\n\nA: Those files are installed by Samsung SideSync.\n", "Q: Contacts.app - list all groups a contact is in Is there a possibility to list all the groups, a contact is in, on the card.\nThis would make the organisation of my contacts much easier\n\nA: My solution doesn't list the groups on the contact card itself, but it may still solve your situation:\nBy holding down the \"Option\" key when you have a contact selected and the \"Groups\" pane showing, the groups which contain the selected contact are highlighted.\nRelated:\n\n\n*\n\n*Highlight the groups a contact is in?\n\nA: Welcome to AskDifferent!\nUnfortunately, the answer to your question is no.

With Terminal 2.6.1, when I ssh a linux box, sometimes I don't know why, the two fingers scroll change behavior. Instead of scrolling the command output, it scrolls the command history. \nHow to exit this mode?\n\nA: I was tracking down the same bug and found the culprit at https://github.com/bpython/bpython/issues/517. If you are using ssh and your connection drops, it will cause scrolling to scroll through your history instead of scrolling the command output. As mentioned in that issue, the fix is to either run the reset command or quit the terminal and launch a new one.\n\nA: If you want to exit the history scrolling mode and switch to the command output scrolling mode go to the menu View -> Hide Alternate Screen.\nIf you want to exit the command output scrolling mode and switch to the history output scrolling mode go to the menu View -> Show Alternate Screen.\nWhen you are in history scrolling mode holding Shift allows you to scroll the command output. The reverse is not true.\nThis whole behavior can be disabled in \nTerminal -> Preferences... -> Profiles -> Keyboard\nby unchecking Scroll alternate screen\nUnder the checkbox, it's indicated:\n\nWhen the alternate screen is displayed, send input instead of scrolling the terminal view. Press Shift to temporarily reverse this setting.\n\nI still don't know how the history scrolling mode is sometimes accidentally activated.\n", "Q: Mail app crashes on iPhone 6 I am using an iPhone 6. Whenever I try to open the default Mail app on my phone, it crashes within one or two seconds, rendering the app useless.\nThe phone was running iOS 8 this morning when the problem was occurring, so I decided to make a backup and update to iOS 9.3.1, just in case 9.3.1 had a bug fix for this problem.\nHowever, after updating, I am facing the same issue.\nAny fixes?\n\nA: What eventually ended up solving the problem was removing my email account from the phone, then re-adding it.\nThe steps to doing this are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Quit Mail (Double-click Home button, swipe up)\n\n*Open Settings\n\n*Tap Mail, Contacts, Calendars\n\n*Select your account, then hit Remove / Delete\n\n*Add it back by going back to Mail, Contacts, Calendars, selecting Add Account, and re-entering your information.\n\n\nA: My Mail ap would allow me to see mail for a second and then close. I tried to reset without erasing, but it didn't work. I briefly noticed that my mailbox was trying to send something. I ended up puttingthe phone on airplane mode and it would allow me full access to the ap. I cleaned out the outgoing mail and it works now. \n", "Q: Access Genius Bar history and notes online?

Your detailed notes also are not generally available to you - just summary information about some cases. If you need more data than you can access, contact AppleCare - online, phone or the genius bar to retrieve a case history and/or request information from case notes.\nIn specific, businesses can get added details through the Joint Venture program or as a self-servicing AppleCare account.

Is there a way I can get this into my calendar?  I tried forwarding the work e-mail to my home address and adding the event from the .ics file but I get This invitation data is out of date when I try and do this.\n\nA: I got the \"this information data is out of date\" message on my iPhone, and the work-around for me (based on a different discussion thread) was to temporarily disable wifi. With wifi disabled, the \"add to calendar\" option re-appeared. Go figure.\n\nA: You need to add the receiving email as an \"Alternate Email\" in your Apple ID settings.

Which one is actually being accessed when loading the sounds in Logic?\n\nA: Both are accessed when looking to load content, but the one in your user area is used when saving your own content. This is consistent with the majority of apps, where the /Library folder is for all users and the ~/Library folder is for your own user.\n", "Q: Can’t restore jailbroken iPhone 5 to iOS 9.0.2 I can’t restore my jailbroken iPhone iOS 9.0.2.\nI run iTunes to restore the iPhone, but I can only see the USB cable and the iTunes logo.

I'm curious that when I check my storage the system reports I've used for apps 100.15GB whereas the applications folder size is just 39.56GB. Is it probably counted for storage that apps use to store their data?. If so how could I inspect those data (e.g. location and size) to consider removing them? \nThanks in advance.\n\n\n\nA: Not all applications are stored in /Applications. That's the default install folder for most applications, but it doesn't include all applications. In fact, since applications are really just bundles of files, most applications can be run from anywhere. \nTo demonstrate this, take a look in System Profiler at Software > Applications. You'll see lots of software that isn't in /Applications\n\nWith that said, using this as a method to eliminate large applications probably isn't the most efficient or easy.

I had previously installed windows 10 on it, but after i partitioned for a mutual accessible drive (for dropbox), windows stalled and i had to reformat it, resulting in a sort of \"locked\" partition.\nIf i click on \"Partition\" in Disk Utility, there are two major partitions, where neither of them have the \"-\" option available(greyed out). I have tried to partition DeleteThis into both ExFat, Fat and Journaled OS X, with no difference.\ndiskutil list reveals this:\n\nand gpt -r show -l /dev/disk0 shows this:\n\nI've also tried to reboot into recovery mode and use the Disk Utility there, with no different result than from normal. \nEDIT: I have of course also tried using Boot Camp Assistant, but it just says \"The start disk cannot be partitioned or restored as a single partition\".\n\nA: The answer is so simple. Forget terminals and internet recovery. Here's what you gotta do:\n\n\n*\n\n*Format the BOOTCAMP-partition through disk utility to MS-DOS (FAT)\n\n*Press cmd + space and write bootcamp-assistant, open bootcamp\n\n*Erase windows and merge the partitions as one mac HD-partition.\n\n\nA: Hold down the Command ⌘OptionR keys at startup to boot to OS X Internet Recovery. Once you have started your Mac in OS X Internet Recovery mode, you need to use the gpt command to remove the unneeded partitions. You can then expand your core storage partition to recovery the freed space back into your OS X partition.\nTo use the gpt command, you need to unmount your physical internal disk. If you are using core storage, then you have to unmount the virtual internal disk first. The commands are shown below. Note: Once booted to internet recovery, the disk numbers may change. The disk numbers used below are based the the values shown in your posted question. The partitions to be removed are 4, 5 and 6 on disk0.\nTo remove partition 6, enter the commands.\ndiskutil  unmountDisk  /dev/disk1\ndiskutil  unmountDisk  /dev/disk0\ngpt  remove  -i  6  /dev/disk0\n\nTo delete the remaining partitions, repeat the commands.\ndiskutil  unmountDisk  /dev/disk1\ndiskutil  unmountDisk  /dev/disk0\ngpt  remove  -i  5  /dev/disk0\ndiskutil  unmountDisk  /dev/disk1\ndiskutil  unmountDisk  /dev/disk0\ngpt  remove  -i  4  /dev/disk0\n\nNow, when executing the command\ngpt  -r  show  /dev/disk0\n\nthe removed partitions should not appear. You can restart back to El Capitan.\nUse the Disk Utility application to recover the freed space. Use the steps below.\n\n\n*\n\n*Highlight the internal disk.\n\n*Click on the icon labeled \"Partition\".\n\n*Highlight the free space shown in the pie chart. See example below.\n\n\n*Click on the \"-\" symbol. Your OS X partition should fill the pie\nchart. See example below.\n\n\n*Click on the \"Apply\" button.\n\n\nA: You can not use DiskUtility on a Bootcamp partition, whatever you want to do. Only use BootcampAssistant when you want to change or delete the Bootcamp partition.\n", "Q: How do I pin a website to the dock in OS X?

Could have shift-lock or F9 for my fn key.\nOr is there a way to change the keyboard shortcut for this to something else?\nI'm on El Capitan (10.11.3).

I have a Macbook with a cracked screen, only the top left half of the screen works, is there anyway to reduce the screen resolution, keep the DPI the same, and thus have the entire OS visible in the top left section of the screen which works?\nThe below photo demonstrates what I mean, with parts of the creen totally unusable, it would make sense to be able to display the whole screen in the remaining usable part.\n\n\nA: You can't control the viewing area by changing the resolution, resolution only influences how many pixels are displayed on the whole screen. Even though it would make sense to restrict the viewing area to that remaining part in your case, there is no easy method to actually accomplish this.\nTechnically this could be done via display calibration, but the tools build into Mac OS X do not have a screen size calibration, only Color Calibration. (External monitors usually have this option in the monitor menu.)\nThe second place to look is inside the Accessibility features (under System Preferences), which include Screen Zoom and some Display settings. What you would need is a global fullscreen negative zoom, which is not supported by default for obvious reasons. (I could imagine, though, that there might be a possibly undocumented setting that would allow this. Either way, there is no obvious way to do this.)\nHowever, you could do the following:\nGo to System Preferences > Accessibility > Zoom\n\n*\n\n*Enable Use scroll gesture with modifier keys to zoom\n\n*Select Picture-in-picture for the Zoom Style\n\n*Open More Options\n\n*Select Stationary for Window position\n\n*Click Adjust Size and Location\nNow, you can move the overlay rectangle to the exact are you can still use in the top left half of your screen.\n6 - Click OK to confirm the Zoom window position.\nLastly, hold Control and zoom in with the least amount possible. Now move the mouse around and you will be able to see every corner on your screen - it isn't the nicest experience and probably takes some time to get used to. I would recommend to just scale all your (safari, etc) windows to the section you can view and only use this method when you have to. Then just zoom out again and that overlay window will disappear.\nIn the end it's a broken screen and your most usable solution would be to get an external monitor.\n[Update]\nThere is also a third-party application that could possibly be useful. It's called SwitchResX. I have not used it myself (and have nothing to do with that company), but they appear to support custom layouts that could be helpful in your situation. I believe you can just try it out for free as well.\n[Update 2]\nIf you care to do some coding and are skilled enough to solve this on your own - this may be a good starting point: https://github.com/Eun/DisableMonitor/tree/master I have absolutely not looked at that code, but it claims to be able to change resolution and turn off certain screens for you - you would probably have to implement something like a screen-grabber that you run in full-screen mode, but only draw the results into your desired area. Actually doesn't sound that complicated now...\nNew Idea\nYou could even try to activate Screen Sharing in your Mac OS X System Preferences and see if you can find a tool that allows you to connect to your localhost. It probably won't work, since you'll see a screen inside a screen inside a screen .... but maybe you could run the VNC in another user account and get it to work?\n1 - Enable Screen Sharing in your main user account\n2 - Create a new user account and switch to that user without signing out\n3 - Start RealVNC or another third-party VNC viewer (the build in ScreenSharing application into Mac OS X doesn't let you connect to your own machine).\n4 - Scale the output window to your viewable area.\nYou could do this with VNC or you could install TeamViewer or Splashtop or any other third party tool that allows you to do screen sharing.\n", "Q: My login keychain cannot be found.

I have installed iTunes on my PC.\nHowever, when I click Photos → Sync Photos,\nit says\n\nYou can choose which photos from your computer are copied to your iPhone.\n  It seems that it copies photos from the computer to the iPhone, but not the other way around.\n\nQuestion:\nHow do I transfer a large video (> 2 GB) from an iPhone to a PC?\n\nA: You can use the program iExplorer. It is free, and you can download it to view files on your iDevice. Simply plug in your phone, open iExplorer, and then on the sidebar, select Photos -> Recorded Videos.\n\n\nA: A method which works for me is to use Google Photos and a WiFi network.\nI install Google Photos on my iPhone.\nWhen the iPhone is connected to a WiFi network,\nthe video automatically gets uploaded to Google Photos.\nAfter the video is uploaded and processed,\nI can simply download it from Google Photos onto my PC.\nThe shortcoming of this method is that it can be slow,\nand it can drain my iPhone battery.\nFor example,\nit may take 1 hour to upload and process a 5 GB video to Google Photos,\nthough it takes only about 5 minutes to download.\n\nA: I have had same problems with my iPhones (5s and 7).  I found that my problem was my phone was just too full, and it was causing phone to act \"buggy\" and slow.  I was able to transfer small pics but videos were a nightmare, and often the iPhone would become unrecognized after one video transfer, or even before.  Then I would have to unplug/replug my phone in to pc and try again.\nI found that a newer lightning cable (the one with my 7 not my 5s) helped a little bit.\nBut what really made the difference for me was clearing off several GB of space on my phone (delete or offload some apps and stuff like that, which was also very difficult to do while phone memory was low).  \nOnce I had more free space on my phone than the size of the largest video I had, then photo/video transfer from iPhone to Windows pc was a piece of cake again.\nI guess just like with Windows PC's, you should always try to keep a good chunk of free space for it to work with.  I wish I could set a warning on my iPhone, when I only have a couple GB of free space left, so I can make it a priority to move/backup my pics BEFORE phone acts flaky.  \nAnd I really wish I could make the iphone pause taking video (or at least give me a warning), before it records onto all the free space left on my phone!  It has happened many times as I was recording, that the video stopped, but only because there was no space left on the phone.  That seems like it would be great, except that then the phone is slow and buggy and it's really hard to transfer pics/videos off to regain that free space needed!\n", "Q: How can I bring back my world clock widget? I love my world clock widget, but today I don't see it. How can I bring it back?\n\n\nA: Go to System Preferences → Extensions and click on ‘Today’ to see the World Clock widget.  Make sure it has a check next to it.  When you go back to Notification Center, you should see the clock.\nI've had problems where some of my widgets would disappear for no obvious reason.  I don't know why this happens but I always end up going back to Extensions to add them back.\n", "Q: How do I run a .sh or .command file in Terminal I've always wanted to be able to run a script I've downloaded online directly from the Finder but just double clicking the file does not work. \n\nA: OP's question was how to run the script in the Finder. None of the Unix solutions above do this. The answer is to set the file's extension to .command, eg, script.command. Double-clicking it will start Terminal and execute the script. (Make sure permissions are set to be executable.)\n\nA: The reason it doesn't work after downloading is the file permissions don't allow it. To enable execute permissions, open Terminal and type\nchmod 755 /path/to/script.\nInstead of typing the full path, you can drag the script onto the Terminal window from Finder.\nThen, to execute, just enter\n/path/to/script.\nAgain, you can drag and drop the file onto the Terminal window. This syntax should execute the script using the correct shell as defined on the first line of the script.\n\nA: Alternatively, you could also do\ncd /directory/with/executable\nchmod +x executable     # only required if your file is not already executable\n./executable\n\nwhich will also run the executable file with its specified shell (if specified in the shebang #!/bin/(shell)\n\nA: Open Terminal, type in sh /path/to/file and press enter. \nFaster is to type sh and a space and then drag the file to the window and release the icon anywhere on the window.\n\nA: chmod u+x myfile.sh\ncp myfile.sh /usr/local/bin\n\nedit ~/.bash_profile and add the following line:\nalias myfile=./myfile.sh\n\nexecute the following command-line:\nsource ~/.bash_profile\n\nthen you will be able to run your file as a program \n$ myfile\n\nA: Follow these steps to run the script files:\n\n\n*\n\n*Right-click on the .sh file.\n\n*Hover over Open With.\n\n*Choose Other....\n\n*You should be in the Applications folder. Open Utilities folder and select Terminal.app.\n\n*If you can't select Terminal.app, change the enabled applications from Recommended Applications to All Applications.

There has to be something better, right?\nOr, this looked good, uut it's no longer an option in Sys Preferences.\n\nThank you!\n\nA: Even though Apple says ignore accidental trackpad input is enabled by default, this does not seem to be the case in Yosemite/El Capitan, as several users have pointed out on the Apple support forums.\nTo address this issue, I made a program that disables the trackpad for a short time when typing on the keyboard.

Display options give me either 3840x2160 or 1920*1080. Full 4k is too small, but 1080p on a 28 inch is too big. I cannot find a way to sclae to something in the middle like ( 2560x1440 or 2880x1620). \nI tried using SwitchResX,but their scaling down looks terrible. \nAny suggestions?\n\nA: One thing you can try is to hold Alt while selecting Scaled in the Display pane of the Displays view in System Preferences. On my Mac, that increases the selection of resolutions (and the effect of that is sticky; if I hold Alt and click again after reverting to Default for display, the list shrinks back to what it was initially, but clicking back and forth without Alt shows me the same list of resolutions each time). It's possible that won't help, if your monitor simply doesn't offer up intermediate resolutions, but that might not matter if it's the GPU that does the scaling rather than the monitor.\nI tend to prefer to choose a mode which uses the native resolution of the display, because it maximizes the crispness. It's possible your 1080P is actually 2160P, but described by System Preferences as Looks like 1920 x 1080; that uses four times as many pixels per character in the font selection, compared to a true 1080P. Depending on whether your monitor is treated as equivalent to a Retina display when connected to your Mac, what it's calling 1080P could be either (a true scaled 1080P, or just a better choice of fonts). If the applications you commonly use are sufficiently capable of changing font size, you can increase the font size (if you're using 2160P) or decrease the font size (if your 1080P is like a Retina 1080P). Then again, if the pixels are small enough, an intermediate scaled resolution (if System Preferences offers that with help from the Alt key) might look OK (for me the pixels on a 28\" UHD display are big enough that they don't look good to me scaled, but then again the display on my 27\" Retina iMac has completely spoiled me).\nOne problem with relying on applications to scale fonts is that it doesn't change the menu bar and dock, but that does allow you to adjust the content you probably spend the most time looking at.\nIn any case, it's probably worth your while to try the Alt trick to see if that changes the list of resolutions.\n", "Q: Alcatel 3G Modem X600 - Kernel Panic on resuming Alcatel X600 is a 3G USB dongle. It worked well with the two previous OS X version. I have updated and am using OS X 10, El Capitan.

The reason this method was chosen is that the installation was new and somewhat experimental.\n\nA: It looks like you've done more than the expected basic troubleshooting (reboot, try debug mode, single user, try the same AppleID from a new user account) and you're looking at either a cascading failure (multiple caches or multiple keychains with bad signing data) or some lower system level failure in the code signing / update / permissions.\nIf you bring a second Apple ID to the app store app on this Mac and you can't sign in with two accounts - the conclusion would be that the OS is the problem.\nIf you can use the Apple ID you want on this Mac on another Mac to sign in to the store - you can rule out network issues and a problem with the intended Apple ID.\nI would probably download the Server app from a new OS (you could boot to recovery and install OS X cleanly onto a USB or other external drive and use the Mini or you could use a different Mac entirely. Once you have the correct Server downloaded - transfer it to the problematic Mac and see if it can launch.\nAt that point, I'd probably get a good backup of the server and consider an outage to nuke and pave:\n\n\n*\n\n*The wikiadmin command is beefed up recently - https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT206232\n\n*Bender will make backups of OD, complete settings backup as well as individual silo backup files so you can selectively restore each service one by one (which in your case might be of benefit).\n\n*Time Machine - just in case you contact Apple engineering for support with this case. If you have AppleCare on the Mac in question - enterprise support is a phone call away, and that should be your first call rather than doing anything I suggest here.\n\n*Bootable clone backup - using Disk Utility, Carbon Copy Cloner, SuperDuper or similar.\n\n\nIf you really want to dig in, maybe run the latest combo installer, but in truth - server app is running all the services in a \"pause/wait/hold\" pattern since the OS updated and the server needs to run all the migration steps - so most of the help in the net isn't geared for a system in your state.\n", "Q: Concatenate not working in Numbers Sample numbers file\n\nB4 contains CONCATENATE(B2,B3)\nIn the file above, I am getting syntax error on B4, despite the formula seems correct.

Sometimes when I try to unmount a disk using the \"diskutil\" command I get the following message:\n$ diskutil unmount /dev/disk1\ndisk1 was already unmounted or it has a partitioning scheme so use \"diskutil unmountDisk\" instead\n\nwhen I replace \"unmount\" with \"unmountDisk\" it works perfectly fine.\nSo my question is, what's the difference between the \"unmount\" and \"ummountDisk\" commands?\n\nA: You are using the command incorrectly. When issuing diskutil unmount, you should refer to a partition. You are referring to an entire disk. For example disk0 refers to the entire disk, where as, disk0s1 refers to partition 1 on disk 0. The letter s stands for slice which is another word for partition.\nOn the other hand, it is Ok to refer to either the entire disk or just a partition when trying to unmount an entire disk. So\ndiskutil unmountdisk /dev/disk0s1\n\nwould be equivalent to \ndiskutil unmountdisk /dev/disk0\n\nBoth unmount the entire disk0.\n\nA: From man diskutil:\n unmount | umount [force] device\n     Unmount a single volume.  Force will force-unmount the volume (less kind to any open\n     files; see also umount (8)).\n\n unmountDisk | umountDisk [force] device\n     Unmount an entire disk (all volumes).  Force will force-unmount the volumes (less kind\n     to any open files; see also umount (8)).  You should specify a whole disk, but all\n     volumes of the whole disk are attempted to be unmounted even if you specify a parti-\n     tion.\n\nSo diskutil unmount just ejects a single volume/partition, diskutil unmountDisk the whole disk (including all volumes/partitions).\n", "Q: How to run a shell script from an AppleScript?

The temporary solution is to disable and then re-enable WiFi, but this gets very tiresome. It has been occurring more frequently recently (~15min → 5min).\nSo far, this has only happened at my home and at my cabin - it's fine on other networks. \nI usually get an error in Chrome along the lines of:\nThis webpage is not available\nDNS_PROBE_FINISHED_NO_INTERNET\nHowever, I have tried multiple different DNS configurations, so this does not appear to be the problem. \nOther laptops and my Galaxy S6 connect to these routers without problem.\nAny ideas?\nEDIT: Just got this error result earlier:\nYour computer is offline.\nDNS_PROBE_FINISHED_NO_INTERNET\n\nA: I am also having Wi-Fi issues (for months) with MBP 2014 and I found a temporary solution to the problem. I have tracked down the problem to be or kernel or driver implementation bug with 802.11n (the important info here is the \"n\"). I have an Airport Express and inside the configuration for Wireless (Radio Mode) you can choose for 802.11n with 802.11b/g compatible and a lot of other options. if you have one two, before clicking the dropdown hold ALT(option) to show more options and select 802.11b/g only, if not look for this inside your router/access point. You can check what type of mode you are using holding ALT(option) and clicking on the Wi-Fi icon at the menubar (the same place as the clock), at the bottom you will see PHY Mode, and check there the mode you are connected if is 802.11n or 802.11g. You need to be using 802.11g, and see if your connection will drop.\nI think this answer your question, why in some places your Wi-Fi works (using 802.11g) without a problem and others you get drop (802.11n) connections.\nI am using 802.11g for a while now and no driver crash. When the driver crashes the only way to reset automatic is to restart the network interface and turn it on again, that's why the Mac do it, but when it returns the bug continues (it can't communicate to the router and no connection is made) and you have to turn Wi-Fi off and on. But it continues because there is a problem with 802.11n. So we have to wait for Apple to fix it and I have been waiting for a long time and no solution yet!\nJust to add info, I have tried everything you can imagine, El Capitan fresh install, do all sort of configuration, disable energy options and etc. but nothing seemed to work for me.\nPlease give me a feedback if this works for you.

Quit iTunes. Move the iTunes folder to the desired location. Then, make a symbolic link to the moved iTunes folder, drag that symbolic link to the Music folder, rename the link to be exactly \"iTunes\" and you are done.\nAn alias won't work. It has to be a Symbolic Link. \nI made my symbolic link using an Automator Service. Automator is not set up to make Symbolic Links out of the box, so you have to get something third-party to enable it. Here is a link to a good article on how to get the piece you need and also how to make and use the Automator Service. Here is the link:\nhttp://www.makeuseof.com/tag/automator-create-symbolic-links-dropbox-mac/\nThere are other ways to make a Symbolic Link but you only need one, so here you go.\nYou don't have to change anything at all in iTunes. That's the beauty of this method. The symbolic link satisfies iTunes' need to have an iTunes folder in the Music folder, while pointing to the real iTunes folder somewhere else. Just be sure you name your Symbolic Link \"iTunes\" after you move it (don't try to rename it before you move it-- you will be trying to name it the same thing as the real iTunes folder).\nYou can always throw away the Symbolic Link and put the iTunes folder back in the Music folder if you'd like, so you really have nothing to lose.

You didn't say exactly what the purpose of the external mount is so some of these bits might not be what you need but then again, it might be exactly what you are trying to do.\nAs mentioned in your question and in @perhapsmaybeharry's answer, the mount command doesn't support UUIDs so diskutil is the recommended utility.  However, the fstab file does support UUIDs so you can store the mount parameters in fstab then diskutil will read the parameters from fstab to mount your drive.\n\n\n*\n\n*In ~/Music/iTunes/, create a folder to be used for the mountpoint.  I used SSD_Music.\n\n*Use sudo vifs to edit the fstab file, add the following as a single line (editing for the UUID and USERNAME as appropriate) then save/exit.\nUUID=F8C88B2D-5412-343B-8969-254F3AC559B8 /Users/USERNAME/Music/iTunes/SSD_Music hfs rw,noauto,noowners,nobrowse 0 0\n\n\n*\n\n*noauto = don't mount the drive during boot. I've encountered times where the drive was mounted as root instead of as me so it is better to wait until you log in.\n\n*noowners = Ignore ownership on the volume.  Permissions will be inherited from the mountpoint.  If I didn't use this, the mounted volume was owned by root but subdirectories were owned by me.\n\n*nobrowse = Don't show the disk in the Finder sidebar or Desktop.\n\n\n*Perform the mount with diskutil mount F8C88B2D-5412-343B-8969-254F3AC559B8 (Note: Do not include the UUID= prefix in this command.\n\n*Hopefully it mounted without errors.  Check it with mount which should show something like /dev/disk2s2 on /Users/USERNAME/Music/iTunes/SSD_Music (hfs, local, nodev, nosuid, journaled, noowners, nobrowse)\n\n*If you are doing this for iTunes, you need to create an alias for the iTunes Media folder to point to the folder on the mounted disk. \n\n\n*\n\n*Quit iTunes if it is running\n\n*cd ~/Music/iTunes/\n\n*mv 'iTunes Media' 'iTunes Media-bak'\n\n*ln -s 'SSD_Music/iTunes Media' 'iTunes Media'\n\n*ditto 'iTunes Media-bak' 'iTunes Media' to copy your media to the new drive.  Skip this if you have already copied it over.\n\n\n*Unmount the disk with diskutil unmount ~/Music/iTunes/SSD_Music\n\nNow that you can mount the drive by UUID, let's automate it when you log in.\n\n\n*\n\n*In ~/Library/LaunchAgents/, create a new file called local.mount_SSD_Music.plist\n\n*Copy/Paste the following XML into the new file then save/exit.\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n    <key>Disabled</key>\n    <false/>\n    <key>KeepAlive</key>\n    <false/>\n    <key>Label</key>\n    <string>local.mount_SSD_Music</string>\n    <key>ProcessType</key>\n    <string>Background</string>\n    <key>ProgramArguments</key>\n    <array>\n        <string>/usr/sbin/diskutil</string>\n        <string>mount</string>\n        <string>F8C88B2D-5412-343B-8969-254F3AC559B8</string>\n    </array>\n    <key>RunAtLoad</key>\n    <true/>\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\n\n*Make sure the drive is unmounted\n\n*Test the mounting using the new LaunchAgent plist with launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/local.mount_SSD_Music.plist.  Hopefully it mounted without errors again.\n\n\nSo now if you reboot, the external drive will be automatically mounted when you log in.\nHope this helps! \n\nA: When using OS X, it's usually more advisable to use diskutil for disk-related activities.\nTL;DR:\nTo mount a volume/disk by identifier:\ndiskutil mount /dev/diskXsY          # mounts just that volume\ndiskutil mountDisk /dev/diskX        # mounts the whole disk\n\nTo mount a volume by UUID:\ndiskutil mount [Volume/Partition UUID]\n\nTo mount a volume by label:\ndiskutil mount [label]\n\n\nExplanation\nWith diskutil, node identifiers (/dev/diskXsY) are interchangeable with UUIDs: in any diskutil operation (such as eject), a UUID can be specified instead of a node identifier. From the man page:\n\nDEVICES\nA device parameter to any of the above commands (except where\n  explicitly required otherwise) can usually be any of the following:\no   The disk identifier (see below).  Any entry of the form of disk*, e.g.  disk1s9.\no   The device node entry containing the disk identifier.  Any entry of the form of /dev/disk*, e.g.  /dev/disk2.\no   The volume mount point.  Any entry of the form of /Volumes/*, e.g.  /Volumes/Untitled.  In most cases, a \"custom\" mount\n  point e.g.\n                 /your/custom/mountpoint/here is also accepted.\no   The URL form of any of the volume mount point forms described above.  E.g.  file:///Volumes/Untitled or file:///.\no   A UUID.  Any entry of the form of e.g.  11111111-2222-3333-4444-555555555555.  The UUID can be a \"media\" UUID\n  which IOKit places in an IOMedia node\n                 as derived from e.g. a GPT map's partition UUID, or it can be an AppleRAID (or CoreStorage) set (LV) or member (PV) UUID.\nFrom man diskutil, section 'Devices'.\n\n\nObtaining these identifiers/UUIDs/labels are simple, with either of the following commands:\ndiskutil list                               # lists all connected volumes and their identifiers\ndiskutil info /dev/diskXsY | grep UUID      # gets the UUID of a connected volume\n\nThe returned values from these commands should look something like the following:\n$ diskutil list\n/dev/disk0 (internal, physical):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *500.3 GB   disk0\n   1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1\n   2:                  Apple_HFS Macintosh SSD           499.4 GB   disk0s2\n   3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s3\n\n$ diskutil info /dev/diskXsY | grep UUID\nVolume UUID:              1F340CD7-G071-4218-98DG-2D08G89CC57C\nDisk / Partition UUID:    76E7G531-G6C3-5E37-C11B-BCEEC67D12G4\n\nAs shown above, the identifier can be found from the IDENTIFIER column, the label from the NAME column, and the UUID from either UUID field (either UUID will mount the volume).\nBy label:\n$ diskutil mount Recovery\\ HD\nVolume Recovery HD on Recovery HD mounted\n\nBy UUID:\n$ diskutil mount 67EG87EB-CB01-4ED9-082D-303F63CF6394\nVolume Recovery HD on 67EG87EB-CB01-4ED9-082D-303F63CF6394 mounted\n\nBy disk identifier:\n$ diskutil mount /dev/disk0s3\nVolume Recovery HD on /dev/disk0s3 mounted\n\naddition for edit to OP's question: mounting to a custom path\nYou can do this with diskutil mount and the -mountPoint option. From the man page:\n\nmount [readOnly] [-mountPoint path] device\nMount a single volume.  If readOnly is specified, then the file system is mounted read-only, even if the volume's underlying file system and/or device and/or media supports writing; even the super-user may not write to it; this is the same as the rdonly option to mount (8).  If a -mountPoint is specified, then that path, rather than the standard path of /Volumes/VolumeName, will be used as the view into the volume file con- tent; a directory at that path must already exist.\nFrom man diskutil, section 'Verbs'.\n\nThe syntax to mount to a custom mountpoint is as follows:\ndiskutil mount -mountPoint /path/to/custom/mountpoint [volume (identifier/UUID/label)]\n\nBear in mind that /path/to/custom/mountpoint must be a directory, just like with mount, and that your identifier/UUID/label are specific to the volume (i.e. /dev/diskXsY not /dev/diskX). Mounting to a custom mountpoint cannot be done with diskutil mountDisk, and only works with a single volume at a time.\n\nA: I'm combining some of my comment into an answer as I believe it address the fstab issue.\nAs you've already found out, the mount command cannot use UUID or LABEL and must use the Disk Identifier, e.g. /dev/disk0s4.  Additionally as perhapsmaybeharry pointed out that the OS X method is to use diskutil.  To address your update... However fstab can use the UUID or LABEL, just look at the examples in the man page for fstab.  In a Terminal type fstab and then right-click on fstab and select Open man Page. Read it in its entirety! :)\nI have no problems using fstab, however I always use at least the first four fields.  I see you'er missing the third field, (fs_vfstype), in your comment.  Are you omitting it in fstab?  You should edit your question and show exactly what you've tried in fstab and which editor you've used.\nTry: UUID=1738336E-68DD-46B1-997E-57469CF0472D /mount/point hfs rw,auto where /mount/point is a preexisting directory.\nI've tested this on my system using my UUID, it's your UUID in the line I'm suggesting you try above.\nNote: It would only mount to the defined mount point if I included the third field, (fs_vfstype), otherwise it mounted in /Volumes even though the second field, (fs_file), existed.\n", "Q: How can I ask Siri what my current cell phone number is?

Barring that, you could use voiceover to navigate there and hear what is set or you could ask Siri to dial 804-222-1111 and use that or similar service to check your caller ID.\n", "Q: Can I re-install OS X on an encrypted drive without the password?

DVD-ROM starts like a jet and a progress bar pops up. It goes all the way to very close to the end and then DVD-ROM stops and no more progress. I never have installed any OS X and now I am wondering if such a thing is possible at all. I checked the Boot ROM version and upgraded to the last version that matches my mac 8.1. \nMy question obviously is what should I do?\n\nA: I've created bootable DVDs (DVD+R DL, specifically) for Mavericks, Yosemite, and El Capitan, and used them without any problems to install on various MacBook Pros. Thus, the OS X installer can't require write access to the installer's volume (as of 10.11.x anyway). Creating an El Capitan installation DVD is slightly different than previous, but a user 'tywebb13' on MacRumors is who I've followed each time I've created these DVD installers. He's posted the Terminal commands (including short explanations for each) to create a bootable El Capitan DVD (or just the ISO if you skip the last command).\nhttp://forums.macrumors.com/threads/el-capitan-bootable-dvd.1923931/page-2#post-22407115\nNOTE: Some of the posts in that thread refer to installing them in virtual machines, which adds confusion. But 'tywebb13' is consistently focused on optical media installers for actual Apple hardware, and I've always followed his instructions to success.\n", "Q: Why is this stock iMac so slow at launching apps? I bought a refurb iMac from apple.com:\n\n\n*\n\n*21.5\", late 2013\n\n*2.9 GHz Core i5 \n\n*8 GB DDR3 \n\n*Geforce GT 750M 1024 MB \n\n*1 TB SATA Disk\n\n\nNo SSD, but this should still be performing well for basic tasks. It's stock, other than installing Chrome, Spotify, FCPX. I have nothing running other than OSX 10.11.2 defaults (wifi, bluetooth, airplay icons in the toolbar).\nAn example of the problem: I click on Chrome in the dock - it bounces for 30 seconds, then no bouncing, then ~30 seconds later Chrome is open. FCPX bounces for about 2 minutes before showing the splash screen; splash screen is up for ~60 seconds before the app is open.\nPerformance while using apps (Chrome, Finder, FCPX, TextEdit) is good about 50% of the time, and beachball heaven the other 50% of the time.\nIs this all because of the HDD? I have about half of the hard drive filled with movies, music, and photos that I manually dragged over from an external when I first set it up.\n\nA: It could very well just be the slow-ish hard drive. Apple generally does not put 7200RPM drives in its Macs. While it could be the O/S and it might be worth your while to image the internal drive onto an external drive and wipe the internal and start fresh with the OS and Apps. Depends on what is more valuable to you time or money.\nAn SSD WILL speed up your system, often it's like a whole new Mac, depending on your usage. A deep cleaning of the current OS or a wipe/reinstall might fix the issue or at least improve it.\n", "Q: El Capitan animation direction in Spaces El Capitan allows switching workspaces in Mission Control view (which shows an overview of all windows) by using 4-finger swipe left/right gesture. However, when invoking Mission control from fullscreen mode, and then swiping left/right, the spaces seem to visually slide in the wrong direction, which is very irritating. \nFor example, if there are 3 spaces (desktop1, desktop2 and fullscreen application, in that order), then swiping up from fullscreen view followed by swiping left twice, would result in switching to desktop2 and then desktop1, which is correct, but visually, the desktop background would slide first to the left, and then to the right (instead of sliding to the left twice). Just to clarify, this is not related to 'natural scrolling direction' option of trackpad. The problem is that the animation is inconsistent when moving between spaces. \nDoes anybody else experience this problem or knows how to fix it? \n\nA: Check that under System Preferences > Trackpad, \"natural scrolling direction\" is enabled.\nNot having this option enabled would cause the screen to follow the exact direction your hand is swiping along the trackpad, and not the natural direction I assume you're used to.\nNB: I'm not sure of the exact term for natural scrolling but I'll update my answer when I can be.\n", "Q: Change ISO volume label on OS X? I have some ISO files here with weird volume labels. I want to rename them to something I can easily remember.\nI know in Windows using either winiso or poweriso (both are non-free?) it can be done but I'm not so sure in OS X. I did search the net but nothing useful came up.\nThanks!\nedit: I believe it's best explained with an example:\nI have an ISO file called \"myiso.iso\". When I double-click on the ISO file to mount it, it appears as \"myweirdname\" in Finder.\"myweirdname\" is the ISO Volume name.\n\nA: There is no direct way, that I know of, natively in OS X to edit the volume label/name of an ISO Image as can be done by using, e.g., UltraISO in Windows.  In other words, with the proper preferences set for UltraISO the volume label/name can be changed and saved to the ISO Image without recompiling it. I actually use UltraISO under OS X via Wine for this very reason.\nAlthough this cannot be done natively directly under OS X, nonetheless it can be done using hdiutil by creating a new ISO Image from the mounted ISO Image having the volume label/name wanting to be changed.\nYou'll need to use the hdiutil imageinfo command, e.g. hdiutil imageinfo $NAME.ISO, to get the necessary information to configure the hdiutil makehybrid command to make the new ISO Image having the volume label/name that your want, instead of what it currently is. Have a look at the man page for hdiutil or just type hdiutil makehybrid -help in Terminal.\nAs an example, I'm going to use an ISO Image, of a DVD, that does not contain any DRM, as the source has to be DRM free.\nThe key info I'm looking at is, partition-scheme:, partition-name: and partition-filesystems: showing respectively, ISO9660, $NAME, and both ISO9660: $NAME and UDF: $NAME where $NAME is shown as, e.g., FOO_BAR_WEIRD in all three places.\nI just want it to say FOO_BAR, getting rid of the WEIRD part, so my command line will be as follows, after first mounting the FOO_BAR_WEIRD.ISO image by double-clicking it in Finder, in Terminal I used the following command:\nhdiutil makehybrid -iso -udf -iso-volume-name FOO_BAR -udf-volume-name FOO_BAR -o FOO_BAR.ISO /Volumes/FOO_BAR_WEIRD\n\nI then used hdiutil imageinfo FOO_BAR.ISO and compared it to the output of hdiutil imageinfo FOO_BAR_WEIRD.ISO and it showed it has the same partition-scheme: and partition-filesystems: but different $NAME, as it should. The file size was ~.5MB larger however the newly created ISO Image had the name I wanted and played just fine as the original did.\nSo, it's doable but it takes a little time, work and extra disk space, which is why I run UltraISO via Wine under OS X. :)\nNote: I tested this using a DRM free ISO Image of a Movie DVD and may require additional command line options and or additional steps depending on the type and contents of the ISO image.\n\nA: I ran into this issue myself.  Even though you change the name of the ISO, when mounted it gives these arbitrary names as the mount point.  After much trial & error, reading upon reading, and learning more about CD/DVD directory allocation than I ever wanted to know, I have stumbled upon a process that is quite simple and achieves the desired results. \nNote: I assume you already have created an ISO image via whatever software application you use.\nI am working in the downloads folder of my Mac...\n1) Create a new folder with the desired mount point name, will be used later as the new mount name.  It is character limited (I believe less that 16 characters) and does not like spaces.  If you need to separate words use the underscore.\n2) mount the offending iso.\n3) select the iso in finder ctrl+a to select all items in the image.\n4) ctrl+v to paste contents into the newly created folder.\n5) Once the content has completed the copy, open the diskutility gui.\n6) Select File > New Image > Image from Folder.\n7) Select the New folder you created with the desired mount name.\n8) Direct the new image to be created in your documents directory (I have found fewer errors in the process when sending it to a directory other that the active one containing the image files), select unencrypted option, select DVD/Master as format.\n9) this will create a new image in the documents folder as a .cdr with the name of whatever you elected in the previous screen.  rename the .cdr to .iso as these are basically the same.\n10) mount the newly created .iso and the mount name should now be whatever the folder name was that you created the image from.....   tada!\nHope this helps....\n\nA: I created a python script to resolve this exact issue. I saw this post that talks about the offsets that these disk images use. I wasn't able to find a specification, but through some quick research with Hex Fiend I was able to spot them all. It turns out that there are just such offsets for UDF iso images, too. I haven't tested this extensively, but it works on the two images I could find on my system. \nThe offsets I discovered are: \n32808, 65561, 67701, 71765, 98329, 100469 and 104533\nYou'll need to use terminal and I believe that Python 2 is stock with macOS, so this should work for you. \n./update-names.py myiso.iso \nIt writes irreversibly to your file, so make sure that you have a backup.\nHere is the code if you'd like to try it yourself.

I tried several windows management tools (like Spectable, or Stay) but these did not work for the XQuartz app.\n\nA: This worked for me when working with Inkscape:\n\n\n*\n\n*Close XQuartz (and Inkscape)\n\n*Change the Mission Control Preferences (unselect Display have separate spaces)\n\n*Log out\n\n*Start Inkscape\n\n*Change the Windows Inkscape preferences (Edit/ Preferences) to \"Don't save Windows Geometry\"\n\n*Close Inkscape end XQuartz\n\n*Reset the Mission Control Preferences (if you like)\n\n*Log out and back in.\n\n\nAll the credits to:\nhttps://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/eggbotuser/48RbZ2Pey5A\nI have two monitors and OSX Sierra and Inkscape 0.92.2.\nGood luck.\n\nA: There is a far simpler way.\nGo to the System Preferences Display panel.\nThen untick 'Mirror Displays'. You should see the XQuartz window(s).\nMove them around a bit.\nThen tab back to the System Preferences window - the Arrangement may be behind a monitor dialog, but you should be able to move the monitor dialogs out of the way and then un-enable 'Mirror Displays'.\nOr if you tick the 'Show Mirroring options in the toolbar' option then you can reach the Display dialog from the toolbar.\nIf you really wanted to take your time for other occasions - you could set up a keyboard shortcut to toggle the 'Mirror Displays' on and off.\nMuch easier....\n\nA: It seems like the issue is that when I plug the external screen, it messes with the coordinate system of my Mac's screen, effectively shifting the origin of my screen by the resolution of the external screen.\nIn other words, from the point of view of XQuartz the origin of my Mac's screen changes from 0,0 to 2560,1440 (which is the resolution of my external screen).\nThis means that if Inkscape is somewhere near origin (0,0) but still associated with my Mac's main screen then it doesn't appear on the external screen nor in my main screen. It is basically in \"limbo\" between the 2 screens.\nThe solution is to move the Inkscape window to a new coordinate that takes into account the size of the external screen, and this is where wmctrl comes in useful:\nbrew install wmctrl\nwmctrl -r Inkscape -e 0,2560,1440,1200,700\n\nOf course you need to replace 2560,1440 with your own external screen's resolution and 1200,700 to suit your main screen resolution.\nIn order to make it more convenient I created 2 alias, to fix the coordinates for my Mac screen and for the external screen, respectively:\nalias fixInkscape='wmctrl -r Inkscape -e 0,2560,1440,1200,700'\nalias fixInkscapeExt='wmctrl -r Inkscape -e 0,0,0,2560,1300'\n\nRemember that each alias only works for the screen that Inkscape is associated with, you still need to drag-and-drop the window in order to switch screens. wmctrl won't do it automatically, but it certainly helps in \"fishing\" it from limbo.\n\nA: I have had this issue for a few years. In my case the problem arises when I use two external displays arranged one on the left of the other. If the menu bar is on the rightmost display (System Preferences/Displays/Arrangement -> menu bar is a white stripe on one of the displays, can be moved between them) then InkScape windows get lost (to see its location you can use Mission Control with keys Ctrl/Up-Arrow, it can be seen that a dialog or windows is far left on one of the displays).\nSolution: move the menu bar to the leftmost display.\n\n\nA: As mentioned by others, this issue may be caused by a totally different coordinate system of X11. When using XQuartz, I tried the following:\nOpen Mac System Preferences>Displays, click on Arrangement Tap.\nRelocate the external screen to the right of the main screen.\nProblem solved! Change the settings back when you are done with XQuartz.\n\nA: This worked for me:\nGo to System preferences - Displays and untick the box next to \"Show mirroring options in the menu bar when available\".\n\nA: I met this problem before and it's very annoying.  Finally, I realized that because the size and resolution of additional monitor are different from my Mac's. Those resulted in a 'non-existing' space between monitors.  Sometimes windows would locate in that space and could not be moved.  Luckily, I found we can remove the 'non-existing' space by changing settings on Mac. \" System Preferences->Mission Control and uncheckDisplays have separate spaces.\"  Then re-login MAC, the problem should be gone.  \n\nA: Quitting XQuartz (instead of quitting Inkscape first and then XQuartz) directly solved my problem. If the problem appeared again I did the same.\n\nA: In the XQuartz Window menu make sure the window you want to view is selected (or you can hi Command+1 etc.), then select Zoom from the Window menu. This should bring the window into the correct view.\n\nA: This worked for me.\nChange the Mission Control Preferences (unselect Display have separate spaces)\nBasically i dont need spaces anymore since I have 2 monitors.\n", "Q: How to 'custom install' with brew?

Otherwise, you'll run into this the next time too.\n\nA: If you can see it in diskutil list, locate its identifier (comes in the form of /dev/diskx) and run:\ndiskutil mountDisk /dev/diskx\n\nwhile replacing /dev/diskx with your disk identifier.\nIf even that does not work,\ndiskutil mountDisk readOnly /dev/diskx\n\nwill mount your disk as read-only so that you can get your data off in the case that you have corrupted your disk's partition table (very, very unlikely caused by hard-unplugging your disk). If so, you will need to format your hard drive, through the steps found here, along with the man page obtainable through man diskutil if you need more information.\n\nA: That has happened to me many times. Go to Launch Pad, Disk Utility, and select the disk that won't mount. Then select Repair.\n\nA: I had the same problem. Failed mount, eject and repair. Windows saved my life. I plugged the external hard disk to a Windows laptop. Copy a file from the external hard disk to the desktop and cut the file in the desktop and paste(replace) back to same location in the external hard disk. Ejected the external hard disk properly from the Windows PC and plugged it to my Macbook. Problem solved.  \n\nA: Easy solution. Following steps fixed the issue for me:\n1. Run the following command to check that nothing is blocking disk mounting:\n\nps aux | grep fsck\n\n2. If fsck is using the disk, you need to kill the process.\nFor example for this result:\n\nKill the process running the following command:\n\nsudo kill -9 1536\n\n3. Here the disk is mounted and you'll be able to use it. You can check it on Finder, but to avoid repeating all previous steps each time you use the disk, continue with following steps.\n4. Eject the disk from Finder like always, with up arrow\n\n5. After ejecting the device from Finder, you'll see fsck running again same command used on step 1. So you'll need to wait for fsck finish, before disconnecting the disk. This took me around 27 mins for 1Tb disk. Then, the disk will work like always\n\nA: did you try, first of all, to repair the volume looking for errors with disk utility (or terminal)?\n\nA: I run into this problem today and I finally solve it by eject the disk first. after that you can successfully mount the disk with no error.\ndiskutil eject /dev/diskx\ndiskutil mount /dev/diskx\n\n", "Q: Friend with Android phone and Mac computer defaults to iMessage in Messages I have a friend who uses an Android mobile phone and also a Mac.

Drag that folder to the corresponding folder in the Finder.  In your Finder window, you'll see files named \"Folder name.mbox\" get created.  If you've got a lot of email in your folder, it'll take awhile for this to do, and there's no progress bar to tell you when it's done.  \n\n*Repeat step 4 until you have backed up all of your folders.  Delete the folders that you no longer need.\n\n\nThe contents of \"Folder name.mbox\" are all of the emails that are in that folder.  The contents of \"Folder name.mbox\" does NOT include subfolders, so you will need to repeat these steps for the subfolders.  \nAlternately, if you don't want to create a big folder structure, you could do this slightly differently.  Create the \"Outlook backup 2016-04-18\" folder.  When you drag the folder to the Finder and it creates the \"January.mbox\" file, you could rename that file to \"2015 emails - January.mbox\" (or something else to indicate that it's a subfolder of the \"2015 emails\" folder).  \nNow what do you do with all of these .mbox files?  The good part about .mbox is that it's a standard file format for storing emails, and pretty much any email client can import them.  If you need to view the contents of your .mbox files again, you can simply drag them back into Outlook, and your folder will be there with all of its email (except for the subfolders, which you'll need to drag into Outlook separately).  When I need to bring back all of the email in subfolders, I find it easiest to add the top-level folder first, and then add the subfolders.\nIf this sounds like a lot, there is an application called Mail Archiver X for which I've received many recommendations.  I haven't tried it myself; the $40 price tag is enough for me to drag my Outlook folders to the Finder manually.\n", "Q: Is there a way to resize Safari windows while in full screen mode on Safari 6 or higher? When full screen mode was first introduced the window in Safari was resizable but it seems that it has been disabled or at least disabled by default. Is there a way to bring back this functionality?\nhttp://osxdaily.com/2011/11/04/resize-safari-windows-while-in-full-screen-mode/\n\nA: Safari Responsive Design Mode\nThis is more of a work around than a solution.

When I use RunTastic to track my run on my iPhone and also use the Apple Watch health app to track my run (or not), is the resulting data which is sent to the Health app doubled?\nFor example, if I run 1 mile (and track it on Runtastic and my Apple Watch), would I see 2 miles in the Health app?\n\nA: I've used several apps and you do need to pay attention to which apps read from health app and which write to it.\nIn practice, it's pretty easy to take a screen shot of the Show All Data screen from within the Health app for Walking and Running Distance for example. Then operate the apps and enter an exercise period and repeat the screen shot after the workout is complete.\nYou will want to examine the hour surrounding a 5k run, for example, to be sure that your phone and watch alone are not \"double dipping\" if you have both on you when you run. Adding a third party app in addition to the settings you may have enabled on iOS and watchOS could triple the data.\nAlso, be aware that code can change so even if your app isn't duplicating data now, you'll want to sanity check things periodically in case the developer of the app changes how it reads and writes to the health database.\nIt's easy to go in and clean up a day's worth of double counted data, but you'll likely need an automated tool if you find out weeks or months of data isn't counted the way you prefer.\n", "Q: Can I get the code of a TestFlight app?

In looking at the browser name from our internal web stats I see \"Mobile Safari UIWebView\".  \nWhat device does that represent?  \nWe record \"mobile safari\" separately (and is used 5 or 6 times more).\n\nA: It is not a specific device.

I've been looking for an app to check if the brightness of my computer monitor is too high and is straining to my eyes.\nDoes such an app exist that measures brightness of a monitor using the camera perhaps?\n\nA: I'm not sure this is exactly what you're looking for, they can be pretty expensive, but apps made for professional designers and photographers can do this.  DisplayMate and  Datacolor Spyder5Elite are two often cited products.\nOn the free side, there's several dozen that use the iPhone camera, including LuxCamera, Luxi, and LightMeter Free, to measure light.

This is really frustrating as I used gestures a lot to navigate around my laptop, and even though I use a bluetooth mouse it makes using my laptop unnecessarily laborious.\nDoes anyone know what may be causing the problem, and any solutions?\n\nA: The trackpad is connected over USB - so try these things before seeking hardware service:\n\n\n*\n\n*Check System Information app like the image below\n\n*Disconnect all external devices and restart to reset the NVRAM (that causes the hardware tree to repopulate)\n\n*Make a system backup and possibly reinstall the latest combo update / or install a new OS on an external drive to ensure it's not a problem with the OS / software\n\n\n\n\n\nA: Run Apple Diagnostics\n(I'm assuming you have at least a late 2013 MacBook Pro)\nOne of the best tools in your arsenal is Apple Diagnostics.  It will run through a battery of tests to see if there are any issues with your hardware.  From a powered off state, turn on your computer and hold down  D until the diagnostic screen appears.\nIf errors are detected, it will give you a code - trackpad codes are NDR001, NDR003, NDR004 - be sure to write it down, whatever it is as your failed trackpad may be a symptom of something else (possible, but not likely).  It is also likely that your trackpad has failed and there is no error code - I have personally seen this condition.\nYou can get more info from the following links on Apple's Support site:\n\n\n*\n\n*Using Apple Diagnostics\n\n*Apple Diagnostics: Reference Codes\nReplace the Trackpad\nThe good news is that the trackpad is very inexpensive (trending at less than $40 at the time of this post) and easy to replace.  iFixit.com has an excellent step by step guide but basically it involves taking off the back cover and removing the battery to gain access to the trackpad.\n\nIn my personal experience, every trackpad issue I have encountered has been a failed trackpad (I managed a private school IT department with about 1,500 MacBooks) I have yet to encounter a failed trackpad due to anything else (like a logic board).\n\nA: The battery of my MacBook Pro inflated after 4 years of working since the yesteryear. Now side effects of this inflation are:\n\n\n*\n\n*My trackpad is curved from its center to the upside (instead of being flat)\n\n*The margins of the trackpad are about 0.5mm upper than the top surface of my laptop\n\n*The click functionally is possible only with a lot of pressure\n\n*The term Service Battery is appeared in the battery at the menu bar\n\n\nIn my case, the correct solution is to service the battery but I fixed it temporarily by enabling the Tap to click option in the trackpad's preferences.\nIf these items matches in your laptop, the battery maybe breaks the trackpad. So it is better to service the battery.\n\nA: I encountered the same issue. Possible list of things to try\n\n\n*\n\n*Get into Diagnosis mode by holding D while booting up. For me, the trackpad was working in this mode\n\n*Try booting into Safe Mode. You can do this by holding down Shift during boot. For me, trackpad was not working in safe mode either\n\n*Reset NVRAM and SMC\n\n*Reinstall the OS from the recovery screen. This solved the problem for me. It took an hour, but I wish I had just done this sooner. \n\n\nA: The alternate possibility is that a large amount of dust and stuff has accumulated within the trackpad. This procedure is the same as replacing the trackpad, simply remove the back remove the battery, disconnect the USB between the trackpad and the main computer, carefully remove the small screws holding it in position and the trackpad will lift straight out. You then want to clean all of the edges both on the main body of the machine, where the trackpad was housed, and the perimeter of the trackpad. Some people recommend a cleaning agent to do this. You'll be surprised how often this works.\n", "Q: 250G Disk space has filled up, but DiskInventory only adds up to 60Gs? I cannot for the life of me figure out how my SD drive is filled up because I don't have any large files, especially enough to fill 250G.  I used DiskInventoryX to do a map of my drive and got this, a massive grey box full of \"other\" files, but they don't add up to 250G.  I ran Avast to see if there were any obvious trojans or malware of some sort: nothing.\nWhat else could I do to figure out where this block is going wrong?  I have another user on the system, but its very similar... Definitely not enough to fill even 30G.\nThanks,\nJon\n\n\nA: Hover your mouse over the large grey box and below it will show the path to that file.  Most likely it is your local TimeMachine backup data.\nOS X will keep TimeMachine backups local to your system so that you can do faster restores or if your main TimeMachine system is not available.\nFrom the Apple Menu, select System Info and then click the Storage tab.  You will see how much space \"Backups\" are using on your disk.\nThis space will be automatically cleared as you need more disk space.  It is not really considered used space from the user's perspective.  If you Get Info on your drive, the Used Space value will not include it.\nFor more details on this feature, see this Apple Support Document HT204015\nIf it isn't TM data or it is some other unnecessary cache file, and it is a file that you are sure you want to remove, right click on the grey box and select \"Move to Trash\".\nAnd if you don't want local TimeMachine backups at all, open Terminal and type sudo tmutil disable.  If you need to re-enable them, type sudo tmutil enable\n\nFOLLOWUP 2016-04-19:\nThe large grey box is \"Space occupied by other files and folders\" because you have the \"Show Other Files\" option enabled in the Preferences.  Those are system files that you don't have access to read, and/or files outside of the scanned folder. It appears you started at the top of the drive but it can't access the files/folders not owned by you (i.e. root).  You can see in the picture of the .Spotlight-V100 folder it has a red hyphen icon meaning you don't have access.\nSince you can't [easily] run the app as root, here is another option but it will take more work.\nOpen the Terminal app and type the commands cd / then sudo du -hxs .[^.]* *. This will show the size of each directory tree. For example,\n\n 68M    .DocumentRevisions-V100\n  0B    .PKInstallSandboxManager\n2.0G    .Spotlight-V100\n  0B    .Trashes\n  0B    .dbfseventsd\n  0B    .file\n 44M    .fseventsd\n  0B    .vol\n 21G    Applications\n7.0G    Library\n  0B    Network\n8.2G    System\n292G    Users\n4.0K    Volumes\n2.5M    bin\n  0B    cores\n4.5K    dev\n4.0K    etc\n  0B    home\n  0B    net\n5.4G    private\n1.0M    sbin\n4.0K    tmp\n1.4G    usr\n4.0K    var\n\nYou can then cd into each large dir and list the files with ls -alh or repeat the sudo command until you find the large files.\nDo NOT delete any files unless you know exactly what you are doing.  All of the files/folders outside of the Users folder are for the system.  If you remove the wrong one, you will have a bad week!\n", "Q: How do I add VTT subtitles to a MP4 video to view on an iPhone iOS? I have a .mp4 and .vtt file with the same name. I tried to synch both the files to iTunes by importing them at the same time, but when I play the video, there are no captions. The video plays in the browser (Chrome) with captions fine. How do I add the .vtt subtitles to the .mp4 video? I would prefer a raw, native way to do it, without using a third-party app (except for iTunes). If not possible I would be OK with FFMPEG if needed. \n\nA: Wow I finally found a solution. I found \nhttps://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/FFMPEG_An_Intermediate_Guide/subtitle_options\nand\nhttps://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/HowToBurnSubtitlesIntoVideo\nso I tried a few things and found this worked.\n\nC:\\Users\\Chloe\\Videos>\"\\Program Files\\WinFF\\ffmpeg.exe\" -i russian_ark.mp4 -i russian_ark.vtt -vcodec copy -acodec copy -scodec mov_text russian_ark_sub.mp4\n\nUnfortunately WinFF doesn't have options for subtitles in the GUI. I don't know what mov_text is but luckily FFMPEG can understand VTT and convert to it and Apple can understand mov_text. I tried to use -scodec srt but it kept giving me an error track 2: could not find tag, codec not currently supported in container. Could not write header for output file #0 (incorrect codec parameters ?): Operation not permitted. I didn't want to hard-code the subtitles as described in the second link, but I was almost ready to.\nThanks to Insomniac Software for letting me know Apple can't do this automatically, not even with iTunes.\n\nA: VTT subtitles are a feature of HTML5 which is why it is working in Chrome.  iTunes doesn't support them.\nYou will need to 3rd party utility to embed the subtitle as an additional track in the MP4 container.  Normally I would recommend Subler for this but I don't believe it supports VTT subtitles yet.  However, if you can convert the VTT file into SRT format, then you can easily do it with Subler.\nOnce converted, open the MP4 with Subler, then add the SRT file.  You can choose to have the subtitles simply included in the file so that they are optional during playback or set them to be forced then they will always be displayed (if the playback software supports it, which iTunes and all of Apple's products do)\nHope that helps\n", "Q: one person, two phones, one text thread Is it possible for \"Joe\" to have two iphones with two different numbers and text Sally from both numbers, and when Sally receives Joe's texts they appear as one thread? In other words, Sally wouldn't know he has a second phone because it all appears as one thread. Thanks.\n\nA: Yes. iMessage allows this with the following caveat.\n\n\n*\n\n*Joe uses iPhone A to sign into iCloud with his account. The phone number for the first phone gets associated with the AppleID / iCloud account.\n\n*Joe uses iPhone B to sign into iCloud with the same account. Now both phone numbers are associated with the same Apple ID.\n\n\nNow - set the \"caller ID\" in iMessage from both phones to be the same number (either can be chosen) and for iMessage recipients - all new messages started from iPhone A and iPhone B will be \"from\" one number.\nThis doesn't work for SMS since the carrier assigns the \"correct\" sender in that case.\n\nA: Add both of Joe's phone numbers to the text.  Most text message systems will support this.  So long as both people understand that Joe is using two numbers then there is no confusion, this doesn't meet the requirement of Sally remaining ignorant of two phones in use.\nThe other answer of using an AppleID only works if the two phones are linked by AppleID, and would mean Sally remains ignorant of two phones in use.\nSally putting both phone numbers in contact information should also make a text from either phone number appear to come from same person.  I don't know what happens to a reply, it may only go to phone that text was sent from.  That is unless Joe's phones are linked by AppleID.\n", "Q: How can I open a Terminal window directly from my current Terminal location?

(Technically, you could use the dd command, but no sane person would attempt using dd to fix this problem.) I would recommend downloading and installing the gdisk command from here. To install, you may have to modify the setting on the \"Security & Privacy\" pane of the \"System Preferences\".\nTo use the gdisk command, you will need to disable System Integrity Protection (SIP). Normally, this can be done while in Recovery mode. Since you can not boot to Recovery mode, you can use a product called \"rEFInd\". Many Linux users already have this product installed on their Mac computer. If you do not, you can create a USB flash drive version which can be used to disable/enable SIP. The instructions are given here.\n\nNote: Since you have Debian Linux already installed, you may be able to execute gdisk from this operating system. Since I do not have this operating system installed, I am not going to pursue this further. You can obtain more information from this site. Also, gdisk may be available by booting from an external Emergency Disk. If available under Linux or from an Emergency Disk, you will not have to disable SIP.\n\nOnce gdisk is installed and SIP is disabled, you will need to make three changes. These changes involve modifying both the GUID Partition Table (GPT) and the Master Boot Record (MBR) partition table. The changes are listed below.  \n\n\n*\n\n*Change the type GUID for partition 3 in the GPT from\n48465300-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC to\n426F6F74-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC. Note: gdisk uses a value of\nAB00 to represent the value 426F6F74-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC.\n\n*Make sure the attribute for partition 3 is 0002000000000000. In\nthe example below, I assume the current value for the attribute is\n0000000000000000. If not, make the appropriate corrections.\n\n*Change the id for partition 3 in the MBR table from AF to AB.\n\n\nIn the example below, I create and mounted a sparse image as /dev/disk1. I then used this image as input to the gdisk command. This was done to simulate the conditions on your computer. You will be making changes to your /dev/disk0.\nSteelhead:~ davidanderson$ sudo gdisk /dev/disk1\nGPT fdisk (gdisk) version 1.0.1\n\nWarning: Devices opened with shared lock will not have their\npartition table automatically reloaded!\nPartition table scan:\n  MBR: hybrid\n  BSD: not present\n  APM: not present\n  GPT: present\n\nFound valid GPT with hybrid MBR; using GPT.\n\nCommand (? for help): t\nPartition number (1-5): 3\nCurrent type is 'Apple HFS/HFS+'\nHex code or GUID (L to show codes, Enter = AF00): ab00\nChanged type of partition to 'Recovery HD'\n\nCommand (? for help): x\n\nExpert command (? for help): a\nPartition number (1-5): 3\nKnown attributes are:\n0: system partition\n1: hide from EFI\n2: legacy BIOS bootable\n60: read-only\n62: hidden\n63: do not automount\n\nAttribute value is 0000000000000000.

(hold down the option as I click on the File menu or just use the optionshiftcommandS keyboard shortcut) and I'm good to go.\n\nA: If you open a png image and, once its open, do a select all under the edit menu. After select all hit the delete key. This will leave a blank page that you can add to.  This will destroy you png file so be sure you have another copy of it.\n\nA: This is not a direct answer about opening a new, empty Preview page for an image. However you mentioned wanting to paste an image into Preview, I'm interpreting that as wanting a typical 8.5\" x 11\" page, with an image pasted into it. The following will work:\n\n\n*\n\n*Double click on the image, which should open it in Preview as an image: \n\n*Print the image (command-P)\n\n*Save it as a PDF (lower left): \n\n*This generates a regular PDF file, using the page size you specified in the OS X print dialog.\n\n\nA: When you copy an image and open the preview.app, you can press cmd n to open a new window with the content of the clipboard (File -> new from clipboard).\nAlternatively you can drag and drop image(s) onto the preview.app symbol in the doc to open them in the preview.app.\n", "Q: Problem Installing Windows 7 via Boot Camp I've recently created a DIY Fusion drive (240GB SSD & 1TB HDD) using the core storage commands on my mid 2012 MacBook Pro, I've restored from a time machine backup and everything works great.

Does the SSD get slower if put in the DVD caddy? Because if not it is probably the best and easier solution.\n\nA: Answer to the New Question\n\nYour new question: What if I just swap the drives and leave them swapped? Does the SSD get slower if put in the DVD caddy?\n\nFrom the menu bar you can select \"About this Mac\". From the pop up window, you can click on \"System Report...\".\nPart of this report for a iMac (20-inch, Mid 2007) is given below. (Click on the image or open in a new window for a better view.)\n \nThe image shows the \"Link Speed\" of the SATA controller on the logic board to capable of 3 Gigabit per second transfers. The actual transfer rate (Negotiated Link Speed) with the connected HDD is also 3 Gigabits per second. I happen to know the HDD is a replacement 1 TB drive capable of 6 Gigabits per second transfers. So the controller is limiting this new disk to half of its capable transfer rate.\nPart of the \"System Report\" for a iMac (21.5-inch, Mid 2011) is given below.\n\nThe image shows the \"Link Speed\" of the SATA controller on the logic board to capable of 6 Gigabits per second transfers. The actual transfer rate (Negotiated Link Speed) with the connected HDD is 3 Gigabits per second. So the HDD is limiting the controller to half of its capable transfer rate.\nThese examples should aid in answering your question.\nYou should also consider the cable between the controller and the drive. Most SATA optical drives operate at 1.5 Gigabits per second transfers. So, if replacing the optical drive results in a \"Negotiated Link Speed\" of 3 or 6 Gigabits per second, the cable may not be able to accommodate the high speed transfers. To determine what was the \"Negotiated Link Speed\" with the optical drive, you would have to temporarily put this drive back in your Mac.\nHere is another image from the 2011 iMac.\n\nThis image shows the optical drive to have a transfer rate of 1.5 Gigabits per second. More important is the controller with has a maximum \"Link Speed\" of 3 Gigabits per second. This is half of the maximum \"Link Speed\" the the controller connected to the HDD. So there can be a difference between which way you connect your SSD and HDD. At least this is true for the 2011 iMac used in this example.\n\nNote: From your comments, I see the opposite is true for your Mac. For the HDD (in the primary slot) you reported a \"Link speed\" of 6 Gigabit and a \"Negotiated Link Speed\" of 3 Gigabit. While for the SSD (in the caddy), you reported a \"Link Speed\" of 6 Gigabits per second and a \"Negotiated Link Speed\" of 6 Gigabits per second. So the \"Link Speed\" of both controllers is the same.\n\nAnswer to the Original Question\nBasically, there is no reason Windows can not be installed on your Mac. Your problem is that you want to install in BIOS mode on the HDD, which is /dev/disk1. Normally, the Windows installer creates a small (100 MB) System Reserved partition on the same drive as the rest of Windows installs. The Boot Camp Assistant forgoes this partition scheme, opting instead for a installation that mergers the contents of these two partitions into a single partition. \nSo far we have learned:\n\n\n*\n\n*The USB Windows installer can be created using the Boot Camp Assistant.\n\n*We can not boot Windows from the HDD because it is the second drive\nin the computer.\n\n\nWhat I propose is to return to Microsoft intended design where there are two separate partitions for the Windows 7 operating system. The first small 100 MB partition will need to be created on the SSD, which is /dev/disk0. As before, you can keep the much larger main Windows partition on the HDD.\nThese partitions will need to be created using OS X and be MS-DOS (FAT) formatted. Later, when installing Windows, these partitions will be reformatted NTFS. It would be best if the partition number assigned to each of these partitions is 4 or less. While this is not an absolute requirement, the steps to installation increase dramatically when the value is greater than 4.\nIf you can create these partitions while still maintaining your Fusion drive, let me know. I will update the instructions with the rest of the steps. If you succeed, it would help if could post the output from the following commands. These command will not change your computer. Some may ask for your login password. This is normal.\nsudo  gpt  -r  show  /dev/disk0\nsudo  gpt  -r  show  /dev/disk1\nsudo  fdisk  /dev/disk0\nsudo  fdisk  /dev/disk1\n\nBelow is an outline of the rest of the steps. \n\n\n*\n\n*Boot from the Windows USB flash drive installer.\n\n*Open a Command Prompt window.\n\n*Execute the diskpart command.\n\n*Mark the FAT formatted partition on the SSD (disk 0) as active.\n\n*Exit the diskpart command.\n\n*Enter the command setup to continue installing windows.\n\n*During the installation you will need to select the partition to\ninstall Windows. Before selecting the partition on the HDD, reformat\nboth FAT partitions as NTFS.\n\n\nThe idea here is that Windows will start booting from SSD and finish from the HDD. I tested this boot method using VirtualBox with two virtual drives. At least in this virtual environment, I know the idea is sound. \n", "Q: How to permanently archive Time Machine backup? I have an external hard drive where my Time Machine backups are located. My OS is El Capitan.\nI would like to permanently archive this entire TM backup and move it to another hard drive, and it would be best to archive these backups to a compressed disk image.\nI have tried to archive the Backups.backupdb folder with SuperDuper! and Carbon Copy Cloner. CCC copies files to DMG but Backups.backupdb is only 161 GB in size, and CCC has supposedly copied 190 GB, which has me thinking something is wrong.\nI have not yet tried to create a ZIP archive or a DMG (using Disk Utility).\nHow can I create a DMG to archive Backups.backupdb to another hard drive?\nMore info:\nThanks for help.\nI tried to make DMG using Disk Utility.\nAfter 6 hours, Disk Utility got error: Operation failed with status 2.\nCreating \"TM BU\" dialog, \"hide details\" window was empty during 6 hours.\nI used read/write format because i'm planning to index DMG with Spotlight after DMG is created if that's possible.\nsudo mdutil -i on '/Volumes/TM BU' user name \"name\" password \"password\" with administrator privileges\nThen if possible convert read/write DMG to compressed.\n\nA: I would recommend using hdiutil to image the disk.\nFirst, run diskutil list in the Terminal to see the identifiers for each disk. You'll want to note the identifier for your Time Machine drive (format is /dev/disk#).\nThen, in the Terminal, use:\n/usr/bin/hdiutil create -srcdevice /your/disk/identifier -format UDZO name.dmg\n\nWhere /your/disk/identifier is the /dev/disk# corresponding to your Time Machine drive, and name.dmg is the name of the output DMG. The UDZO format is the default compressed disk image format. The disk image will be a replica of the entire USB drive.\n\nA: I suggest you break it up into two parts: copy the files, then compress them. Apple has the simplest solution to copy files and you can use the Finder to do so; then try the disk compression routine, if you want to go that route.\nFaced with this situation a few years ago at home, and having similar problems, I realized I was just jumping through hoops. I bypassed the entire compression and archiving routine by starting a new Time Machine backup on a brand new drive. I then stored the old TM disk off-site (my office.)\nI've since extrapolated this concept into primary and secondary TM disks for each computer I now use (my iMac @ home, and the iMac and laptop @ work.) I swap drives weekly, using my home as off-site storage for my work computers, and my office for off-site storage of my home computer. If there was a catastrophe destructive enough to lose both sets of disks, I'd have a lot more to worry about than a loss of data.\nFor ultra-crucial files, (encrypted PDF files containing my novels, poetry books and scanned financial and other documents; photos & videos, etc,) I use both Dropbox and Google Drive.\n\nA: I use two strategies to archive backups when using Time Machine:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use more than one drive in Time Machine Preferences. Each time a backup starts, the software picks one drive round-robin style, so with three backups, each connected drive gets one interval every three hours.\n\n*Selectively pick one interval from a backup destination and archive that snapshot instead of backing up all intervals.\n\n\nWith the first method, you just take a drive out of the rotation and store it offline. You could ship it offsite if you wish. This lets you maintain the old history without it getting overwritten with new changes. It takes more drive space than the second method.\n\nTime Machine uses hard links (search this site for details on how that works) so when you have 12 backup intervals of one unchanged file - some tools end up making 12 copies instead of 12 pointers to one file which is why the duplication process can \"explode\" the needed time and space or possible not finish in a reasonable time.\n\n\n*\n\n*How does Time Machine behave when the backup drive becomes full?\n\n*Copying Time Machine backup, destination takes more than original size, are hardlinks being expanded?\n\n*Is there a faster way to copy time machine files from one disk to another?\n\nA: Time Machine backup includes all the history of whatever you backup.\nSo even if you have say 20GB worth of data backed up, provided there are enough changes to the data the overall Time Machine backup can easily fill much more space than those 20GB.\nThis is because it keeps all the different versions of backed up files, in case you ever need to restore a version from a specific date.\nI'm not sure if there is a reliable way to get access to just the latest version of your backup. The procedure described here should be able to purge older versions of each backed up file. Maybe you can reverse the logic and get access to only the latest version of each file and add it to your archive. But that will require some shell scripting.\n\nA: To create a DMG using hdiutil (command line):\nhdiutil create /path/to/folder.dmg -srcfolder /path/to/folder\n\nThis will archive everything in a directory to /path/to/folder.dmg.(There's a pretty good guide on using hdiutil found here, along with man hdiutil.)\nTo create a DMG using Disk Utility (GUI):\n\n\n*\n\n*Depending on your preference, either press ⌘ Command+⇧ Shift+N or go to File > New Image > Image from Folder\n\n*Select the folder you would like to convert into a disk image, and modify the settings in the GUI as necessary.\n\n\n\nFor your case, I would simply replace /path/to/something or /path/to/folder with /path/to/Backups.backupdb, wherever it is located on your system. It is not necessary to archive to the same path, and this may save you time. For example, as you would like to zip archive your backups to another HD:\nhdiutil create /path/to/folder.dmg -srcfolder /path/to/folder\n\nThe methods outlined above can be applied to different situations as well.\nedit: as Mark pointed out, zip archives do not preserve hard links, and as such, is unsuitable for archiving Time Machine backups, which are essentially many, many hard links.\n", "Q: iCloud locate last tracked position?

A few days ago, I tried installing Windows 8.1 on my late 2011 Mac by using disk utility to make a free space on my disk and a Windows 8.1 boot drive to install. While installing, my Mac recognized the boot drive as \"EFI Boot\" (when I pressed the options key to select the boot drive).\nIn the part when I had to format my partitions for installation, Windows created 2 partitions in the free space: 1. the Microsoft Reserved partition and 2. the partition where Windows is meant to be installed. \nThe installation went well, no errors were raised, but when I pressed the options key at startup to boot to Windows, my Mac recognized my Windows partition as \"EFI Boot\" (so now I have 3 options when I pressed the Options key:Macintosh HD, EFI Boot, and Recovery).\nThat is not really a big problem to me, but then when I started using Windows, I couldn't find a way to make the audio drivers working. I couldn't install Microsoft Office either.\nSo, I booted into my Macintosh HD partition, and use disk utility to remove the Windows partition and the Microsoft Reserved partition. Then, I reinstalled Windows 8.1 by following these instructions: Boot camp install of Windows 7 issue, no bootable devices\nEverything went well and the audio is now working, but now, when I press the Options key at startup, I have 4 options: Macintosh HD, Windows, EFI Boot, and Recovery. When I tried choosing \"EFI Boot\", it shows me a blue screen, saying:\n\nRecovery \n  Your PC needs to be repaired \n  A required device isn't connected or can't be accessed.\n  \n  Press Enter to try again\n  Press F8 for Startup settings\n\nWhen I tried pressing Enter and F8 keys, it returned to the same blue screen.\nWhen I tried mounting the EFI partition, I see 3 folders: Apple, Boot, and Microsoft. I tried deleting the Microsoft folder (and I kept the copy of it somewhere else), and boot into the EFI Boot again, my computer froze and restarted. \nThe question is, how can I make the EFI Boot disappear when I press the options key at startup? It's not creating any problems with my Mac or Windows partitions, but I'm very curious about what it actually is, what does it have to do with my computer, and why does it decide to show up when I pressed the options key?\n\nA: Your question has two parts. The first part is repeated below.\n\nThe question is, how can I make the EFI Boot disappear when I press the options key at startup? \n\nThis a duplicate of the question \"Ghost partition, Windows BSOD\". The rest of your question, which again is repeated below, does require further explanation.\n\nIt's not creating any problems with my Mac or Windows partitions, but I'm very curious about what it actually is, what does it have to do with my computer, and why does it decide to show up when I pressed the options key?\n\nThe \"EFI Boot\" appears because the Mac firmware finds the boot file BOOTx64.EFI in the folder \\EFI\\BOOT on the EFI partition of your internal drive. This is part of the UEFI specification. For example, if you go to the \"uefi.org Specifications web page\", you can download and view the \"UEFI Specification Version 2.5\". Sections 3.5.1.1 Removable Media Boot Behavior and 3.5.1.2 Non-removable Media Boot Behavior (on pages 88-90) describe the naming of the BOOTx64.EFI file and that it should appear in the \\EFI\\BOOT folder.\nWhen holding down the Option ⌥ at startup, the Mac firmware will look for the \\EFI\\BOOT\\BOOTx64.EFI file on each EFI partition of all drives accessible at startup. Each occurrence will generate an icon with the label \"EFI Boot\" on the Startup Manager menu.\nWhen Windows installs, some of the startup files are stored in the folder \\EFI\\MICROSOFT. These files are also duplicated (with some renaming) in the \\EFI\\BOOT folder. Not all non-Apple operating systems do this when installing. For example, Ubuntu Linux does not. (Well, last time I installed in EFI mode it did not.) The Ubuntu installer does create a folder \\EFI\\UBUNTU with startup files (GRUB), which the Mac firmware by default ignores. To get Ubuntu to appear in the Startup Manager, you have to manually mount the EFI partition and copy the files in the \\EFI\\UBUNTU folder to the \\EFI\\BOOT folder. (Also, the copied grubx64.efi file needs to be renamed to BOOTX64.EFI.)\nIf you need to do this for two operating systems, then you will need a second EFI partition. This should not present a problem since an EFI partition is fairly small (<200 MB) and the limit on Macs by default is 128 partitions. However, to tell one operating system for the other, while viewing the choices presented by the Startup Manager, you may want to change the icons.\nFor example, I have rEFInd installed in a second 134 MB EFI partition on my iMac. (This happens to be the last of 9 partitions.) Additionally, I have Windows 10, Yosemite (on volume \"Steelhead\") and El Capitan (on volume \"Steelhead2\") installed. Below is a image of my Macs Startup Manager menu. (For a better view, click on the image or open in a new window.)\n\nThe icon can be changed by mounting the EFI partition and adding the icon file .VolumeIcon.icns to the root folder. A collection of these icons, for popular Linux and other operating systems, can be found here.\n", "Q: How to execute app DVD through Terminal of recovery flash drive?

I have two media directories that each have a similar top-level folder structure. I'd like to share them over my network, using either AFP or SMB, in such a way that I can access both of them using one share, with the contents of both directories merged together.\nSo if folderA has the following contents:\n|__ Stuff\n| |__ My Stuff\n|   |__ fileA.txt\n|   |__ fileB.txt\n|\n|__Things\n  |__ video1.avi\n  |__ video2.mkv\n\n...and folderB has the following contents:\n|__ Stuff\n| |__ My Stuff\n| | |__ fileC.txt\n| |\n| |__ Your stuff\n|   |__ fileD.txt\n|\n|__Things\n  |__ video3.ogm\n  |__ video4.rm\n\n...then the network share would appear as the following:\n|__ Stuff\n| |__ My Stuff\n| | |__ fileA.txt\n| | |__ fileB.txt\n| | |__ fileC.txt\n| |\n| |__ Your stuff\n|   |__ fileD.txt\n|\n|__Things\n  |__ video1.avi\n  |__ video2.mkv\n  |__ video3.ogm\n  |__ video4.rm\n\nIf new files are copied into the share, preferably I'd be able to configure which of the two top level folders they are placed into.\nI had originally accomplished this by compiling the mhddfs filesystem for OS X, using it to mount a virtual filesystem that was a combination of my two folders and then sharing that over the network. But after a year or so of use I've found that mhddfs is unstable, at least in OS X. Numerous filesystem errors accumulated across my drives that eventually led to hard system crashes, the drive would often unceremoniously unmount for no apparent reason, and various other unsavory things would happen like copying an application bundle to the network drive and having its individual files be split up between the two shares. Hence why I'm interested if there's a file server solution to this, rather than something more prone to serious errors like a file system solution.\n\nA: A new folder could be created 'Folder' (with Folder A/Folder B hidden by adding '.' before the folder names). In that new folder 'Folder', links to each of the files could be created. When folders are found in '.Folder A' or '.Folder B' a new folder and path is created in Folder.\nA script could go through and first create the folders in 'Folder'. The script would then go through and create links to each of the files.\nThis is hokey as heck, but may work (for Macs and linux machines).\nEach of these steps is a single find command (or a find command calling another script).\nThat's a non-eligant but simple solution. If you'd like me to write/test the two commands I will.\n", "Q: Change Spaces on all connected displays at once Just a simple question - my day-to-day setup is a MacBook Pro with 2 connected external displays.

I have an external battery rigged up for my MBP.  It goes through the magsafe adapter.   The battery is about twice the capacity of the internal battery.\nThe problem is, the macbook thinks it is plugged into AC, so undoubtedly the CPU is in full power mode.   It will gobble this big battery in under an hour.\nI do have graphics set to integrated mode.\n\nA: Unfortunately, there is no direct way to force OS X to use battery-power mode (here, here and here). OS X uses Intel Speedstep which changes the P-state of the processor depending on the computer's power status (AC/battery).\nAFAIK, the only thing you can do is set your AC mode power management settings to the same as battery mode. Using pmset, you can see and set the power settings that your Mac uses for AC and battery scenarios.

As follows, you can generate a string that you can use to reset your AC power settings with the following command:\npmset -g custom | xargs | cut -f2 -d'A' | cut -f2 -d':'\n\nThe difference between this command and the one above is that with this command, we are taking the value after AC power (aka original AC power settings).

Normally you would change them to another text editing function but I don't know about functions like next tab or open a file.  Those would be mapped in the System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts window from a key to a menu in the IntelliJ app.\nBut, if it can accept the Emacs keybindings for other functions, try customizing it yourself.

Any help would be greatly appreciated. \n\nA: It sounds like you have three sources - two mics and the computer which is also doing the recording.\nWhat you need is a mixer like the PreSonus 4x4 (I don't know of a 3 channel mixer).  This will give you control over the sound levels and profile of each source as well as a way to record them all on your computer.\n\nI personally have used these in courtrooms (the 16 channel versions) to record from all microphones and audio sources.  They worked flawlessly.\nThe way it will work is like this:\n\n\n*\n\n*The two mics can go into the \"instrument/mic\" inputs\n\n*The computer audio out can go to one of inputs\n\n*The headphones connected to the headphone port (you can use a splitter here)\n\n\nA: You should be able to plug an \"iPhone-style\" headset into the audio jack and then use a headset with a USB connector for the other person. Just search for \"USB headset with microphone.\" There are quite literally thousands to choose from.\nThe only question that remains is will you be able to use both microphones at the same time. That may require special software. I am not sure as I have never tried this specific setup.\n", "Q: Stronger speaker for iPhone 4, is it possible to buy? My speaker on my iPhone 4 is not as strong as I want it to be, I am not hearing it well when someone calls me - the ringtone is too quiet. It is set to maximum, but still too quiet for my taste. Is there a 3rd party seller that has a stronger speaker?\n\nA: AFAIK, there is nothing like that available. While it is possible to make a louder speaker, I believe iOS sets the volume limit itself, though I couldn't be sure.\nI would imagine if a mod like that were possible, the speaker would need to connect to the headphone jack internally in order to bypass iOS's limit.\nIt's really all just speculation, though.\n", "Q: Can you unlock a Mac that was locked from Find my iPhone & prevent it from being erased? Okay so quick run down, my Macbook Pro was stolen a few months ago. When it got stolen I immediately enabled the lock feature from Find my iPhone, & after a few weeks of waiting with no answers, I got bitter & also clicked the erase feature. Out of the blue, however, someone called my mother & said they found a computer on the side of the road with her name & number on it. So my mother got it off these people, brought it home while I was away, & turned it on. This brought up the lock screen with the \"enter pin\" & the message I put on it to the thieves.\nSo now that I have it back, which I thought was never going to happen or I wouldn't have enabled the erase option, I'm wondering if there's any way to unlock it from this screen but prevent it from wiping the hard drive. I thought about bringing it to an Apple Store before touching it again, but I bought it 5 years ago & don't have the proof of purchase anymore. Yeah it's got my mother's name & number on the bottom, it still shows up in my Find my iPhone, & it has my phone number on the message I put on the lock screen, but I'm pretty sure without a receipt, they can't prove it was mine so they won't be of any help, correct?\nIf I take it somewhere it can't connect to the internet, will I be able to enter the pin & get into the computer without it starting the wipe, because it'll be offline? Or will it start the wipe anyway immediately after being unlocked? I'm in completely unknown territory here so I'm trying to tread carefully before doing anything else with it. I'd just really like to get my files off of it, because all of my papers from college are on there, as well as personal photos & stuff. Is there any way to unlock it without starting the wipe? Trying to look on the internet is basically hopeless because it's such a specific question, & I'm not entirely sure how the erase feature works. Anyone with knowledge or experience would be greatly appreciated at this point.\n\nA: According to the literature, what should have happened is that the erase command should have removed the PIN and the message you sent.  Instead, they shouldn't appear and the system should start wiping the drive immediately.  Looks like it didn't get the erase command or wasn't online to receive the command.  I'd AVOID turning it on anywhere it could get online.  Contact Apple support or take it in.  If you have a Time Machine backup, you could try the PIN and restore if necessary.\n\nA: Yes you have to do nvram reset and install from thumb drive .

The other room is on the other side of a school campus so running a cable would not work.\nThe Canon has an HDMI output and if it is plugged into a TV or monitor it will display fine, as expected.  However I am trying to get the feed from the camera onto a MacBook Air.  I know desktop computers back in the day had TV tuner cards for a similar function, but I am not sure about the MacBooks.\n\nA: The MacBook Air and similar MacBooks do not provide HDMI inputs, only outputs. Although there is a device that will allow you input HDMI if you are willing to pay for it. (Usually fairly expensive) Something like this is what you are looking for: www.hauppauge.com/site/products/data_hdpvr.html\n\nA: You can use a game capture device for this. Elgato HD is one, but I don't recommend it as it doesn't play well with Mac.\n", "Q: Can I tell if a found Macbook Air is lost or stolen? I work in a backpacker hostel where people from around the world leave behind an amazing amount of stuff, not all of which is junk.\nI've noticed that a Macbook Air model A1465 / 2631 has been sitting here for a couple of weeks.\nNow that I've checked that it doesn't belong to any staff member I'm wondering if it might be lost or stolen.\nIs there either some way online or via the Apple Store that lost and stolen Macs are tracked?\nI am a technical computer person but I'm not a Mac person, it doesn't turn on, and there's no power cable. But there is a Mac Store I can get to if need be.\nPLEASE DO NOT OFFER LEGAL ADVICE. I'm following our workplace procedures and my local laws. I'm only asking here for the technical advice.\n\nA: No, it is impossible to tell if a found Macbook Air is lost or stolen via physical examination of the device or its operating system.\n\n\n*\n\n*Computers of the Apple MacBook Air line are not equipped with Kensington security slot which might indicate theft if damaged.\n\n*Mac OS X or any other contemporary operating system that can be installed on MacBook Air device does not have any property that changes at the moment of theft.\nApple Inc. published the article \"Report a lost or stolen Apple product\" on their official support pages with clear instructions for users of Apple products which got lost or stolen:\n\nIf you have lost or found an Apple product, please contact your local law enforcement agency to report it.\n\nQuoted from the version last modified on Mar 18, 2016\nHence the only official way to make sure if a particular unit was stolen is to contact appropriate local law enforcement agency.\n\nA: If I had forgotten my Macbook Air I would be delighted if you first went to an apple store. Even if there is no 'Find my iPhone' installed there is still the possibility that the owner has registered his/her Macbook Air with Apple – so I do see some hope that the original owner could be found this way.\nAnother option I see would be to check the Contacts – or even better Apple Mail app to find the owner – if the Macbook Air is not password protected. \nI know some people would probably disapprove, but I successfully returned already two phones I found by simply calling somebody from the contact list.\n\nA: To directly answer your question: yes.\nIf the owner set up the \"Find my Mac\" option it could be found online. I am not sure if the dead battery prevents this or if it uses a backup battery for this function. Plus if they were traveling abroad their network carrier may not support this. \nIf the original owner registered the serial number with Apple for warranty then Apple would know who originally bought it. However, it could have been re-sold and from that point there is no way to tell who owns it.\nSo, the easiest way to find the owner is to charge it up, start it up, and see if it auto logs in. Then find their contact info in the Contacts app. If it requires a password to log in then you are back to square one.\nGood luck!\n", "Q: Can't achieve a higher than 1920x1080 on AOC U3477Pqu, powered by late 2011 Macbook pro...? My late 2011 Macbook pro comes with an AMD Radeon HD 6750M 512 MB graphics card and Apple state it:\nSimultaneously supports full native resolution on the built-in display and up to 2560 by 1600 pixels on an external display, both at millions of colors\nhttps://support.apple.com/kb/sp644?locale=en_US\nHaving recently bought the AOC U3477Pqu I have so far only managed to achieve 1920x1080 via a mini-displayport to DVI adapter.\nAOC U3477Pqu - http://www.currys.co.uk/gbuk/computing/pc-monitors/pc-monitors/aoc-u3477pqu-quad-hd-34-ips-led-monitor-with-mhl-10028876-pdt.html\nI thought maybe an end to end displayport cable might help me achieve 2560x1600 so I purchased a mini-displayport to displayport cable but the monitor does not even receive a signal.\nAOC customer service and Currys (the retailer I bought it from) say I should check my graphics card (which I've done, as above). \nCan anyone suggest something else I could try?\nPS: I know the monitor can achieve 3440x1440 and I'm planning on building a PC to make use of this but of course I'd still like to be able to use my Mac with it...\nThanks in advance for any help.\n\nA: Your Mac has DisplayPort 1.1, which does not have enough bandwidth for 3440x1440@60Hz (DisplayPort 1.2 on newer Macs can do 3840x2160@60Hz), and a passive DisplayPort to DVI adapter can only do single link DVI, which is not enough for the advertised external resolution of 2560x1600. Apple sells a Mini DisplayPort to Dual-Link DVI Adapter for $99 (it costs more than a passive adapter because of the active circuitry required; it uses a USB connection to power that circuitry). If your monitor has single link DVI, even that won't help you, and even if it helps you, you won't get the full resolution from your Mac on that monitor over DVI or DisplayPort without reducing the refresh rate.\nIt's conceivable that you could get 3440x1440@30Hz over DisplayPort, but your experience thus far with DisplayPort doesn't bode well for that. Some monitors allow you to choose between DisplayPort 1.1 and DisplayPort 1.2 in the configuration menu (I needed to change that on my first UHD display), but even if your monitor allows that, it's not clear that it would help; aside from the bandwidth issue, there's also the unusual aspect ratio.\nI have not found specifications for your monitor which distinguish DisplayPort 1.1 versus 1.2, or single link versus dual link DVI, but the specified maximum resolution and refresh rate strongly suggest DisplayPort 1.2. I have a 3840x2160 display with a dual link DVI input which cannot do its native resolution over DVI; I believe that tops out at 2560x1440 (though I suppose it's possible a different dual link DVI output could improve that).\nI recommend DisplayPort 1.2 for your PC's video output, when you build it.\n\nA: Previous answer all about the hardware. \nTry SwitchResX for the software side. I've used different versions of this for years and without fail it has always fixed resolution challenges. \n", "Q: Changed Office365 password, cannot change in mail.app: account already exists \n*\n\n*mac os 10.11.4\n\n*mail app 9.3\n\n\nHad a working exchange/office365 account.

Any methods such as a keyboard shortcut or an API.\n\nA: Not sure if this is a proper solution since it involves Logi Option app (for setting up Logitech wired/wireless keyboards and mice). But it works for me with my MX Master 2S mouse.\nI found out that the Zoom function in Logi Option app does the same thing as a pinch zoom on trackpad. It's vector kind of zoom - not pixelated like bitmap zoom. I've assigned my Gesture Button for \"Zoom using scroll wheel\" (hold down Gesture Button and scroll up/down for zooming in/out).\nThere is also a quicker Smart Zoom option for one-click, one-level zoom.\n\n\nA: I am using Apple Magic Mouse.\nIn Settings > Mouse > Point & Click,\nthere's a check box to turn on Smart Zoom that allows you to double-tap (tap not click!) the Magic Mouse and it zooms just like the trackpad.

The webpage is CSS/Java and the screen requires you to scroll down in order to view the entire page, all current solutions are not capable of scrolling down to view the whole page and only screenshot the visible portion. The second problem is that a certain combination of clicks needs to be pressed in order to go to the next page. I have considered using a \"Cross browser testing\" solution since some are capable of screenshots. The problem with that is that none are free and none are capable of entering login/password authentication.

The benefit of this approach is that you don't have to deal with logins etc. I just logged in once in my browser and then simulated clicks inside that browser.\nBelow is a screenshot of my macro.

I'll boot on Mac OS when my computer gets cold (it doesn't boot mac os when warm, that's my main problem), and give you any additional required information.\nIn advance, thanks for you help!\nMore informations, that you would probably ask:\niMac-de-Antoine:~ antoine$ diskutil list\n/dev/disk0 (internal, physical):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *1.0 TB     disk0\n   1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1\n   2:                  Apple_HFS Macintosh HD            500.0 GB   disk0s2\n   3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s3\n   4:       Microsoft Basic Data LINUXOS                 32.0 GB    disk0s4\n   5:       Microsoft Basic Data SWAP                    5.0 GB     disk0s5\n   6:       Microsoft Basic Data DATA                    320.9 GB   disk0s6\n   7:       Microsoft Basic Data BOOTCAMP                141.0 GB   disk0s7\n\n\n\niMac-de-Antoine:~ antoine$ sudo gdisk /dev/disk0\nPassword:\nGPT fdisk (gdisk) version 1.0.1\n\nWarning: Devices opened with shared lock will not have their\npartition table automatically reloaded!\nPartition table scan:\n  MBR: hybrid\n  BSD: not present\n  APM: not present\n  GPT: present\n\nFound valid GPT with hybrid MBR; using GPT.\n\n\n\nCommand (? for help): i\nPartition number (1-7): 7\nPartition GUID code: EBD0A0A2-B9E5-4433-87C0-68B6B72699C7 (Microsoft basic data)\nPartition unique GUID: A45E8584-415A-4B66-9E37-1FAA60981CC3\nFirst sector: 1678133248 (at 800.2 GiB)\nLast sector: 1953523711 (at 931.5 GiB)\nPartition size: 275390464 sectors (131.3 GiB)\nAttribute flags: 0000000000000000\nPartition name: 'BOOTCAMP'\n\n\n\nCommand (? for help): i  \nPartition number (1-7): 6\nPartition GUID code: EBD0A0A2-B9E5-4433-87C0-68B6B72699C7 (Microsoft basic data)\nPartition unique GUID: BEE4F0DE-2837-4C06-877F-3ADB72B1D173\nFirst sector: 1051031584 (at 501.2 GiB)\nLast sector: 1677871103 (at 800.1 GiB)\nPartition size: 626839520 sectors (298.9 GiB)\nAttribute flags: 0000000000000000\nPartition name: 'DOS_FAT_32_Untitled_5'\n\n\n\nCommand (? for help): p\nDisk /dev/disk0: 1953525168 sectors, 931.5 GiB\nLogical sector size: 512 bytes\nDisk identifier (GUID): 00002E14-03EA-0000-EA68-000054300000\nPartition table holds up to 128 entries\nFirst usable sector is 34, last usable sector is 1953525134\nPartitions will be aligned on 8-sector boundaries\nTotal free space is 787861 sectors (384.7 MiB)\n\nNumber  Start (sector)    End (sector)  Size       Code  Name\n   1              40          409639   200.0 MiB   EF00  EFI system partition\n   2          409640       976972135   465.7 GiB   AF00  Customer\n   3       976972136       978241671   619.9 MiB   AB00  Recovery HD\n   4       978241672      1040741671   29.8 GiB    0700  DOS_FAT_32_Untitled_4\n   5      1041003816      1050769439   4.7 GiB     0700  DOS_FAT_32_Untitled_3\n   6      1051031584      1677871103   298.9 GiB   0700  DOS_FAT_32_Untitled_5\n   7      1678133248      1953523711   131.3 GiB   0700  BOOTCAMP\n\nMore informations:\niMac-de-Antoine:~ antoine$ sudo gpt -r show /dev/disk0\ngpt show: /dev/disk0: Suspicious MBR at sector 0\ngpt show: error: bogus map\ngpt show: unable to open device '/dev/disk0': Undefined error: 0\niMac-de-Antoine:~ antoine$ \n\n\niMac-de-Antoine:~ antoine$ sudo fdisk /dev/disk0\nDisk: /dev/disk0    geometry: 121601/255/63 [1953525168 sectors]\nSignature: 0xAA55\n         Starting       Ending\n #: id  cyl  hd sec -  cyl  hd sec [     start -       size]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n 1: EE    0   0   2 - 1023 254  63 [         1 - 1678133247] <Unknown ID>\n*2: 01 1023 254  63 - 1023 254  63 [1678133248 -  274468864] DOS FAT-12  \n 3: 00    0   0   0 -    0   0   0 [         0 -          0] unused      \n 4: 00    0   0   0 -    0   0   0 [         0 -          0] unused     \n\nI can clearly understand I messed up...

I tried reinstalling El Capitan using a USB drive, but once it reboots it tries to go through the installation process again. When I take the USB stick out it gives me the prohibitory symbol. \nI tried to restore to a time machine backup from a time capsule using two different dates. \nThe first restore attempt was to a date when I first installed El Capitan. That resulted in it saying there was already a corrupted version of the OS and it couldn't restore. So I formatted the hard drive and tried again, it resulted in a prohibitory symbol.\nThe second restore attempt was to a date right before I installed El Capitan and was on I think Mountain Lion. That resulted in a file showing a question mark in the middle. \nWhat should I try next?\nEdit: I installed an SSD in this two months ago and the S.M.A.R.T. settings are fine.\n\nA: It was a bad sata cable according to the genius bar.

Can the same approach be applied to an app that creates contract while disclaiming offering legal advise?\nI'm interested if the kind of app I'm proposing would be allowed on the App Store?\n\nA: Only Apple's review staff can answer this question. Any answer offered here can only be an opinion.\nAs the Apple's App Store guidelines stand today, the app may be accepted. However, Apple reserves the right to reject apps that carve new niches and push boundaries.\nContact Apple\nTalk to Apple's App Store staff about how best to approach your app and how to avoid being rejected:\n\nApp Review\nFind out the status of your app and submit general questions for the App Review Team.\n\n\nA: Apple has made it abundantly clear that they will reject apps for reasons that change over time.\n\n\n*\n\n*The review guidelines explicitly say - your app will be rejected if it's too similar to many other apps. So - the first person to do this might breeze through review. The 10th or 50th, not so much.\n\n*The review guidelines and nature of thousands of apps means that not all reviews are equivalent - what one app does to get through might be rejected for weeks or months as you work with Apple to meet the review you get. Different teams and different people will make different decisions no matter how well intentioned a company is to make reviews uniform and fair to all.\n\n*iOS apps of the category of remote notarization are now live (several versions of that app exist), many real estate and digital signature verification / electronic contracting services exist (this is far more crowded a slot than notary) and all manner of business apps are booming on the app store as the premium and pay to play gaming juggernaut gets so saturated that apps with real functionality will hopefully become more prevalent.\n\n\nThus, setting aside any notion that you can \"read the tea leaves\" based on what apps have been approved in the past, it's probably a \"first mover\" advantage and don't invest more than you can afford to lose until you have something you can submit and then work through your specific review feedback with Apple as opposed to guessing what may or may not be an issue.\n", "Q: How can I disable Mail.app when I click on an email address? By default, clicking on an email address from another mac app (such as Slack) launches the Mail.app application in a compose view to that email address.\nI would like to disable this - I never use the Mail.app and most times I encounter an email address I'd like to copy/paste it somewhere else, not compose an email to that person.\nIs there a way to disable that behavior?\n\nA: Had the same problem here, but decided to do a little more. Instead of opening the \"Finder\" app, I used the \"Automator\" to create an application that literally does nothing!\nThe key is to save the Automator project and them put a command on it that will close the same Application you're editing! Them just set it as the default mail application. This way you won't have to worry about some application opening when you click in the address.\nI made a simple tutorial with some screenshots if you want to check it out:\n\nA: Notwithstanding any sneaky Terminal commands I know not about, OS X will always have the need to open some app upon clicking an e-mail link. Literally any app of your liking will do.\nSuch an app might be an app you don't mind being opened. Like… the Finder!\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Mail Preferences and go to the first tab, General. Choose the pop-up menu for Default email reader and pick Select….\n\n\n*Choose Macintosh HD (or whatever you've renamed your boot volume to) → System → Library → CoreServices → Finder.app.\n\n\n*Try it out! (I can't post mailto: links here though. )\nIf you work with spaces or full-screen apps, clicking a mail link might switch spaces. But at least no apps are launched. On my computer, not even a new Finder window is opened.\n", "Q: How to color the Python syntax in nano I have been using nano a lot recently to code on Python. I have been flying by on it all until this little stump, no color... it makes it harder to know if you got the syntax right and harder to code! I'm not the best at code so please be nice and use step by step guide.\n\nA: Nano is perfectly fine as a simple code editor. It has wonderful syntax highlighting. You will probably want an up-to-date version of nano.\n\n\n*\n\n*Install homebrew: https://brew.sh/\n\n*Install nano: brew install nano\n\n*Add this line to ~/.nanorc. That directory has all the syntax highlighting definition files.\ninclude \"/usr/local/share/nano/*.nanorc\"\n\n\nA: It seems like the default version of nano included with OS X is very basic; it may not support syntax highlighting.\n(source: https://gist.github.com/BlakeGardner/5587269)\nYou could try installing an updated version of nano using homebrew and then find instructions for enabling colors.\nSee also this stack overflow answer regarding installing updated nano.\nAlternatively, you could also try a different editor such as TextMate, Emacs, or Vim. These editors will have additional convenience features like auto indentation.\n\nA: You cannot easily \"update and use color\" on OS X using nano, so use an alternative text editor, Sublime text is a good shout.\n", "Q: Mysterious unidentified error message I keep getting this error on my Mac (see attached screenshot).  \nIt happened yesterday and now today again.\nThe dialog is not associated with any application (at least, when I select it, it does not change the menu bar).

Poorly written, use of exclamation mark, reference to \"PC\" - it all looks weird. It's pretty useless too - you get an \"OK\" button and nothing else? What sort of dialog is that?!\nMaybe check your date/time settings, but if there's no problem, I'd be a bit concerned about malware. Did you install any software recently?\n", "Q: How can I determine where mouse input is coming from? Is there a way to log click events? No other mice are connected I am experiencing the strangest behavior. My computer is clearly receiving mouse clicks that I'm not doing, as though they're coming from another mouse, but the cursor never moves on it's own, which I'd expect if another mouse were connected to my computer. I have a MacBook Pro with a Bluetooth Trackpad. For awhile, I thought the trackpad was just uber sensitive, because the clicks would often happen while my finger was resting on it (lightly). But, it's clearly happening when my hands are completely away from the trackpad, keyboard, etc. Maybe my trackpad is just going crazy? \nAnd it's not just single clicks. At times, text on my screen will highlight like a double click. I've also had right-click menus come up while I'm not touching my mouse.\nSteps taken: \n\n\n*\n\n*I've triple checked that no other devices are connected through Bluetooth.\n\n*I removed my mouse and keyboard (and re-paired), hoping it would clear the problem.\n\n*Per this similar problem with Macs connecting, I turned off bluetooth sharing, and internet sharing was already disabled. No dice.\n\n\nIdeas/questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is there a way to log click events so I can see if it's coming from my trackpad, or another source? I've found several mouse \"recorders\", but I don't see any that provide a log of where the clicks are coming from.\n\n*Is it even possible to receive click events from another mouse without receiving movement events?\n\n\nI'm baffled. I'm on 10.11.1. \n\nA: This might be a case of defective trackpad. I had a very similar problem where the trackpad registered constant mouse click. You can quickly test that by connecting an external mouse, then go System Preferences > Accessibility > Mouse & Trackpad > Checkmark \"Ignore built-in trackpad...\".\nIf the problem is with the built-in trackpad, the odd behaviour will stop at this point as long as external mouse is connected.\n", "Q: SMB \"There was a problem connecting to the server\" As of today, I'm suddenly unable to view any SMB shares on my macbook pro (mid 2011 13\" model, El Capitain 10.11.4).\nEverything worked fine yesterday, but today I can't connect to ANY windows file share systems. I have to load Windows XP in Virtualbox and copy stuff across that way.\nI've looked at all the other answers, and this isn't because of some program (I have none running atm), nor is it due to cloud sync (I have it disabled) or time machine (I never use it).\nEverything worked (well, as good as can be expected with file sharing on a mac), and now suddenly nothing works. Using the IP address directly doesn't help. Rebooting didn't help. Restarting the other machines didn't help. Disconnecting and reconnecting WIFI didn't help. And of course, the computer doesn't give any kind of error code to help track down the problem. Just \"There was a problem connecting to the server\".\nThe servers still do show up in Finder (even after rebooting). I just can't connect to them.

I'd install rEFInd in my Mac Mini 2,1. It has a OS X Lion bootable partition and a Windows 10 install ntfs partition. I tried to boot from the ntfs partition but the Windows Installer won't run, only a black screen with a DOS cursor blinking. Now I can't make the rEFInd boot menu show up again. I turn on with \"alt\" key or \"c\" key pressed but Mac Mini ignores and (appears to) try to boot from ntfs partition again...\nAny idea before I have to open the Mac Mini physically?\n\nA: To get started, try to reset NVRAM:\nShut down your Mac.\nLocate the following keys on the keyboard: Command (⌘), Option, P, and R. \nTurn on your Mac.\nPress and hold the Command-Option-P-R keys immediately after you hear the startup sound.\nHold these keys until the computer restarts and you hear the startup sound for a second time.\nRelease the keys.\nResetting NVRAM\n(If the rEFInd installation was performed  something like sudo bless --mount / Volumes / ESP --setBoot --file /Volumes/ESP/efi/refind/refind_x64.efi --shortform, and the boot volume information was recorded in NVRAM).\n", "Q: Can I set some sort of \"never send error report\" on an app that has to be force quit frequently? RSA SecurID. OSX El Capitan. \nThe app is frequently unresponsive when the computer comes back from sleep. Response from IT Support: \"it's not meant to be left running\". In other words I'm supposed to quit the app right after I use it. If I don't do that, the app is unresponsive next time I need it. So I have to force quit it. \nIt seems like there's a whole process involved in Force Quit -- like it's gathering up a stack trace etc. Well in this case there is no point to me reporting the quit it seems; I've reported it a dozen times over the past 9 months and never seen a new version of the app. \nCan I permanently elect to not send an error report for a certain application? When I need to use RSA SecurID I need it right then, not 30s later. Waiting just interrupts my workflow.  \n\nA: Instead of force quit you could find the name of the process(es) you want to quit using Activity Monitor and then create a script that uses the kill command to get rid of them.\nSome details: Chriswrites\n", "Q: How do I stop the search helper from popping up in my browser?

The way I was thinking of doing it would be using a mask and key-framing the \"Transform\". The only problem is that the mask seems to move with the \"Transform\", stopping it from working. Is there another way to do this, or is there a way to lock the mask.\n\nA: I recently did this (as an experiment) by keyframing the motion of the mask in the opposite direction to the keyframed motion of the transform. In my example someone sitting in a chair (in front of a greenscreen) appeared as if they rose up out of a barrel in some background footage: I keyframed a mask where the bottom edge of the mask started at their head and worked down to their waist; at the same time the keyframes for the transform motion moved the greenscreen footage of their body upwards. The end result was a bit messy, but the bottom edge of the mask stayed roughly level with the lip of the barrel as the superimposed footage moved upwards.\nTo key frame the changes into my four-cornered mask I started with a narrow mask where all four corners were just above the head and set a first keyframe. I then moved to the end frame and modified the mask so that the bottom two corners were now at waist level, and set the second keyframe. So the mask height grew over the course of the transform.\n", "Q: Does MAMP installation create conflicts with standalone MySql? I have just installed MAMP. And I have just now realized that I already have a MySQL server and a database that runs under it. Do I now have two MySQL servers? Will they interfere with each other (and if yes, what would I need to do to have the existing database to work with the MAMP version)?\n\nA: I wouldn't anticipate any problems.  I've seen those configurations work just fine.  The only concern I see is that the built in versions of the software get updated automatically by Apple, and the versions you installed will not.  However, Apples updates include the latest fixes more slowly, so if you are diligent in installing them, yours will be up to date a little sooner.  If you are not, the Apple versions are easier to keep updated as the updates are almost completely automatic. \n", "Q: How to Set up WiFi Access Point to Share Folder of Files for Download? I need to set up a WiFi access point that can offering file downloading via web browser using what I will call a \"DEVICE\" here for short.  \nI am open to what the device will be -- my MacBook Pro, a 2nd MacBook Pro I also own, a wide-squat Time Machine I own, another device I have not yet purchased, or one of those devices augmented with a new purchase -- I just want to achive the goals mentioned below.\nI am also interested in the DEVICE being somewhat to very portable, if possible.\nSo I need a DEVICE that will not (necessarily) be connected to the Internet but that will allow people in the same room to connect from their computers via the DEVICE's WiFi and then visit the one website hosted by the DEVICE whose domain hostname will be served via domain name server on the DEVICE where they will see a webpage with links to and descriptions of files they can download via HTTP.\nMy use-case is I will be speaking at numerous WordPress conferences and I want to show people how to set up a local development environment during a 45 minute talk. More importantly I want those who are interested to be able to follow along in semi-workshop format and be able to configure on their own computers.  \nThe problem is the people installing on their own machines will need to download ~750MB and if that takes more than 2 or 3 minutes for 10 to 20 people to download I will almost certainly run out of time.\nI am very technical and I feel like I can envision numerous solutions but cannot quite confirm the details of any one solution.

In either case, you will want to setup a web (Apache) and DNS (Bind) server on your laptop.  That is pretty easy to do if you purchase Apple's server application.  (It is possible to do both without purchasing the server, but requires more technical skill.)  Configure the dhcp settings on your AP to give out your computers IP for DNS.  For that to work, you'll also need to configure the AP to always give your computer the same IP address when it connects.  Then, when clients connect to the AP, you can give them your website and they will be able to download files.  \nTotal cost, approximately $120.\nThis is really only a high level description.

I have a 27\" iMac with 2.5K built-in display resolution. Also i may replace it with a 5K/retina one. The problem is mirroring it's display without changing my mac's resolution other than it's native resolution.\nWhen I use a Thunderbolt to HDMI converter and an HDMI cable, my mac forces me to use lowest resolution between itself and my tv (1920x1080/2K). So it prefers the tv's resolution and my mac switches it's built-in display resolution to 2K and this is not what I want.\nSo, I think about Apple TV and AirPlay mirroring. My question is:\nIs it possible to mirror my mac's high resolution built-in display to a low resolution (2K) tv through Apple TV without changing the mac's resolution?\nIf it's possible, naturally higher resolution image will be scaled down/transcoded to a lower resolution image. Texts and details on original image will be corrupted/blurred but it's ok, I don't expect/need a super clear image on the tv.\nSo, will Apple TV do the job, can it transcode original high resolution image to fullscreen 2K image for my tv?\n\nA: Well macOS comes built-in with this feature. When connecting your Mac to AirPlay, open System Preferences > Displays and just pick the Mac's resolution instead of the TV's resolution (mirror Mac display - match Mac's resolution).\nOn newer macOS versions you can also change this setting from the Control Center icon on the menu bar (next to the Clock) and then pick Displays.\nIf you want something more complex, there's an app called SwitchResX which allows you to force any resolution you'd like on your any of your monitors.\nThe main features are simple enough but it also allows you to change extremely advanced settings so be careful if for example you want to change the monitor timings/frequencies or something like that.\nhttps://www.madrau.com\n", "Q: mDNS not working I re-installed my pfsense firewall the other day, sometime soon there after my macbook stopped doing backups using time machine.\nThe pfsense is installed on new hardware, but the config was restored from the old, so it should be the same as before.\nThe Time Machine target is a synology diskstation, which has worked fine for the at least the last 6 months.\n\nBut connection attempts now just times out:\n\n\n\nConnecting to the share manually also fails similarly:\n\n\n\nSamba using more traditional technology (normal dns) works fine:\n\n\nNormal name resolution and ping works fine:\n\nBut the .local domain is not populating properly:\n\nI don't understand this multicast magic good enough to know where to even start troubleshooting.

If you plug in an external USB keyboard/mouse and everything works, then it's definitely not your logic board as the symptoms would be present then as well.\n\nAs for the cause, it could simply be a manufacturing defect of the keyboard, trackpad, or some other related component.  Without actually having the component to bench test, it would be impossible to guess what exactly is wrong with it.\nHowever, the trackpad and keyboard are technically separate components even though they are part of a master assembly called the \"top case.\"  If you have ability and resources, you can open your MacBook Pro and disconnect either the keyboard or the trackpad.  If the symptoms go away, you will know that is the component has failed.\n\nIf not, do the opposite and see if the results differ.

From what I understand, that feature disables some background activity, such as Background App Refresh and Push (not sure if there's a difference between the two, but anyway), which is supposed to pause the background activity of the apps installed. My concern is whether a non-default app would follow that. This article claims that:\n\nIf I have Airmail or any other third party mail app running, that app will still push and fetch mail like normal. Unless I manually disable those features inside that particular app, I’m not reaping all the benefits of Low Power Mode.\n\nAnd I can see where does that point come from, because when I enable the Low Power mode, the default Mail app does actually stop fetching e-mail, while Outlook doesn't. \nSo I searched Outlook's Uservoice iOS section and they do claim they actually addressed that, and all you have to do is just shut down Background App Refresh: \n\ncompleted Microsoft Outlook responded:\nYou may disable Background App Refresh on your iOS setting.\niOS Settings >> Outlook >> Toggle Off Background App Refresh\n\nThe thing is, Background App Refresh is already turned off and even grayed out because, again, I'm in low power mode. But Outlook still keeps somehow reciving e-mail immediately.\nSo this doesn't make any sense to me. I know Outlook could have some custom code polling mail servers in a loop directly, but since the emails arrive almost immediately, that'd be like constant polling which would kill the battery even faster. So that must be some kind of push, but again, it's supposed to be off while in Low Power?\nThere is a chance that support representative doesn't have a clue of what's going on - I had to call Microsoft once, ended up talking to their outsourced people, and that's the impression I got. So if that's the case, that means the issue is not fixed as he claimed, but that still doesn't clarify why Outlook keeps fetching mail while in Low Power.\nI've tried to research as much as I can, but if I missed something, please clarify. Thank you.\n\nA: If you turn off cellular data (open 'Settings' and select 'Cellular' then turn off 'Cellular Data' option which controls all the apps) this will prevent Outlook from fetching mail.

The Apple TV runs iOS which has several technologies to help maintain system reliability when it shuts off abruptly.\n\n\n*\n\n*Apps are sandboxed and easily deleted and re-installed from the App Store if they should get corrupted data or settings.\n\n*The OS is easily wiped and restored from the network.\n\n*Changes and writes to storage are low compared to computers. The filesystem is journaled and most of the time it reads data and pushes pikes to the sound and video attached as opposed to doing large calculations or maintaining data files where corruption is a problem.\n\n\nYou will save yourself the time to reinstall things if you put it in sleep first (that flushes all writes to storage) but I say you could treat it however you wish and only change to sleep / shut down if you find you are having to maintain it / reinstall apps. Probably, you won't need to take any care of it.\nThe TV is designed to be extremely low power usage in sleep mode, and you give up several functions like rapid wake from sleep, bonjour sleep proxy for other Apple devices like wake for back to my Mac and HomeKit automation since the TV works as a \"hub\" for those activities even when it sleeps. If you don't notice problems and re-cabling the TV to always have mains power is inconvenient - just keep doing what you habitually do with your entertainment power.\n", "Q: How do I add German public holidays to my Outlook 2016 OSX App How do I add German public holidays to my Outlook 2016 OSX App?\nI currently have the UK holidays but want to add the German ones.\n\nA: It’s true, in Mac Office 2016 there’s no longer an option to add holidays. Also, you can’t download a *.ics calendar file and import it into Mac Office 2016. Both workaround only apply to Mac Office 2011, only.\nThe only way around this is to add your Exchange/CalDAV account to Apple Calendar App. Than import your German-Holiday.ics file to your Exchange account. Finally open Outlook and wait until all calendar items have been synced.\nUPDATE Juni 2019: I am getting back to my original answer from 2 years ago. In the meantime Microsoft silently added a couple feature to open ics files. Outlook still lacks a import feature in the Import... menu. But user Rick Troiani pointed out a really nice workaround. \nSolution A: Drag-and-drop your *.ics file right onto my Outlook Calendar. \n...You can also use the following workflow:\nSolution B: Drag-and-drop your *.ics file onto the Outlook icon within the macOS Dock. \nSolution C: Right click your *.ics file in macOS Finder > Open with Outlook. \n\nA: From the official Outlook website:\n\n\n*\n\n*On the File menu, click Import.\n\n*Click Holidays, and then click the right arrow.\n\n*Select the countries/regions or religions whose holidays you want to import, and then click the right arrow.\n\n*Click OK, and then click Finish.\n\n\nOtherwise, you can download the German calendar and manually import on Outlook, doing the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to this website (2016 ICAL CALENDAR HOLIDAYS - ICAL, GOOGLE & OUTLOOK).\n\n*Scroll the list, till you find the German holiday calendar and download it.\n\n*Import the downloaded file on Outlook, and it's done.\n\n\nA: The application indeed doesn't have the functionality. But there is a workaround with the online calendar.\nSign-in online through Office 365,\nNavigate to Outlook > Calendar\nClick 'Add new calendar' in the ribbon and select the sub-option: 'Holiday calendar'\nAfter you've selected the country of choice you will see it added to the calendar collection. \nNext return to the application and (at least for me) it synced and added the holiday calendar of my country.\n\nA: I was able to download a US calendar from the site above, and dragged it right onto my outlook calendar (Mac Mojave, Office 365, Outlook), and Viola, it worked.  I have a different issue, so couldn't log into Office online due to some issue at work.  Looks like the Import instructions are no longer necessary in the outlook client.  You just need a .ics calendar file.\n", "Q: Copying and pasting between tmux panes containing vim instances over SSH in Terminal.app I use vim to develop Perl code on a remote Linux box running Debian Jesse.

I have a Late 2012 27 inches iMac with an internal HDD (that has a Macintosh HD partition, an EFI partition and a Recovery partition) and an SSD.\nI installed Windows 10 on using BootCamp Assistant; the SSD has only the BOOTCAMP partition (relabeled by me as \"Windows\" to make it look better) and the EFI partition. Even if Windows might seem to be installed as EFI (EFI partition, GPT scheme etc...), I mounted the EFI and found out that there is no boot loader on it. I then searched on the Internet, and on some sites they say Bootcamp uses \"MBR Hybrid\", in the sense the drive appears as GPT but behaves as MBR on the Windows side.\nI have intention to install Ubuntu and a custom EFI bootloader (rEFInd) on my Mac, so - to simplify things a little - how do I make sure Windows is ACTUALLY installed as EFI on my second internal volume? Also, I'd like to know if doing so compromises in any way how the BootCamp Support Software (aka BCA Drivers) works.\n\nA: With respect to Microsoft Windows, 2012, through 2014 were translational years for Apple Macs. For the 2011 and older Macs, Windows is installed in BIOS/MBR mode using a Windows installer DVD. In 2012, Apple started to drop the optical drive from its Mac models. To allow Windows to be installed, the Boot Camp Assistant application copied the files from the Windows installer iso, to a USB flash drive. The \"Boot Camp Support Software\" was also included on the flash drive. To install older Windows versions, the \"Boot Camp Support Software\" files had to be manually copied to the flash drive. \nStaring in 2015, Apple dropped the ability to install operating systems that require a BIOS/MBR boot method. This eliminated the possibility of installing Windows 7 on these Mac models. This change brought Macs update to date with the reset of the industry, which converted to EFI/GPT booting of Microsoft Windows in 2011. Also, with the release of El Capitan (OS X 10.11), the Boot Camp Assistant can now install Windows on certain Mac models without the use of a DVD or USB flash drive. \nSo where does this leave the transitional 2012 through 2014 model year Macs? I wish I had an absolute answer. Consider the following.\n\n\n*\n\n*If one had Windows 7 installed in BIOS/MBR mode and upgraded to\nWindows 10, then the result would be Windows 10 running in BIOS/MBR\nmode using the \"Boot Camp Support Software\" intended for a Windows 7\ninstallation. Some people have reported that running \"Apple Software\nUpdate\" afterwards will result in the downloading and installing of\nnewer \"Boot Camp Support Software\".\n\n*Some people have installed Windows 8/8.1/10 from scratch on their\nmodel Mac in BIOS/MBR mode with any problems, while others have\ndone the same on their model Mac in EFI/GPT mode without problems.\nI do not remember anyone trying both methods. Usually, once one method\nworks, they quit trying.\n\n\nSo, it really depends on what the \"Boot Camp Support Software\" for you model Mac will allow. You have reported that the Boot Camp Assistant installed Windows 10 on your Mac using a BIOS/MBR boot method. So I assume this is what is right for your model Mac. However, if you have created the Windows 10 USB flash drive installer, then you could try both methods. Insert the flash drive and restart the Mac. Hold down the option key at startup. If an icon labeled \"Windows\" appears you can try a BIOS/MBR install. If a icon labeled \"EFI Boot\" appears, then you can try a EFI/GPT install.\nIn the end from the user perspective. it really does not matter which method is employed to boot Windows. Ubuntu is installed in EFI/GPT mode which works independent of either Windows boot method. I guess the Windows EFI/GPT method offers a fast boot option, but this can only be used when Windows is the sole operating system on a computer. You intend to include both OS X and Ubuntu Linux.\nNote: Some Linux installers will not install in EFI/GPT mode to a hybrid GPT. To solve this problem, you may need to: \n\n\n*\n\n*(Optional) Make a backup copy of your Protective MBR (PMBR).\n\n*Use the Boot Camp Assistant, Disk Utility or other application(s) to\ncreate a hybrid GPT.\n\n*Install Windows. (Usually to partition 4)\n\n*Save a copy of the hybrid MBR.\n\n*Covert the MBR back to a Protective MBR (PMBR) or restore from backup.\n\n*Install Linux to new partitions without changing the existing partitions.\n\n*Restore the hybrid MBR from the backup.\n\n\nAnother solution, would be to install Linux first, leaving a space for Windows to be installed after Linux. In this case, format the Windows partition HFS before installing Linux and FAT before installing Windows.\nIf you intend to install Windows on a second disk, you may want to read the posts made to the question: \"Problem Installing Windows 7 via Boot Camp\".\n", "Q: Extreme energy usage by Spotlight I recently (two days ago) updated to El Capitan on my work machine (15\" MBP, Mid 2015, 2.5 GHz Core i7, 16GB ram, R9 M370X, 500GB SSD) and ever since then, Spotlight has been draining my battery and causing the fans to spin like it's about to take off from my desk. My battery life has gone from about 6-7 projected hours pre-update to only 3 until it's completely drained.\nHere's a picture of Activity Monitor:\n \nand CPU: \n           \nI initially thought that Spotlight was simply indexing and using high amounts of energy in the process, but 1. it shouldn't be indexing for almost three full days (I don't have very much data stored on the disk at all) 2. the process for indexing is usually called 'mdutil' rather than the actual 'Spotlight' process and 3. Spotlight would usually display a progress bar when it's actually indexing.\nI've rebooted multiple times, tried force quitting the Spotlight process (but it just turns back on and uses the same energy) and tried turning mdutil on and off and forcing reindexing (to no effect, most likely because indexing is not the root issue?).\nDoes anyone know what might be causing this issue?\nI updated to El Capitan on my personal Mac way back when it first came out last fall and I never had this issue.

I have re-installed a fresh el capitan, reset SMC, created new wifi profile/location with google dns, safeboot, updated router firmware, and update router channel. None of these things have fixed the constant dropping. The dropping mostly happens when I open multiple tabs or download multiple things at once. Any recommendations? How can I analyze the dropped connection report?\n\nA: I had a fleet of MacBooks doing the same thing.  What I eventually found out is that OS X has created a virtual interface called awdl0 or Apple Wireless Direct Link.  I won't go into the details of how it works because there is a really good explainaition here. \nWhat we found was that if this interface was active we would have wifi dropouts and performance issues.  If the interface is disabled we had no issues with wifi.\nIt was easily testable by first having it enabled and doing a speed test, then disabling it and doing the same speed test.  The second speed test with it disabled would easily get double the bandwidth.\nIf you look around the net a lot of people are saying that it is causing wifi channel interference.  So it does something along the lines of creating a second wifi connection on the same channel.  The two connections (your main wifi and awdl0) are interfering with each other and cancelling out. \nSolution\nTry this first, open Terminal and type\nsudo ifconfig awdl0 down\n\nTry out your Wifi now and see if that helps.\nIf it does, please note that this fix will not remain between reboots.  You'll have to add something to a startup script or create a task that turns it off on bootup.\nWord of Caution\nThis interface is used to create connections between Apple devices like MacBook to AppleTV or using AirDrop.  I am going to caution you that these services may not work after disabling the awdl0 interface.  \nWe have a bunch of AppleTVs that still work fine with it disabled.

I have an Airport Express and inside the configuration for Wireless (Radio Mode) you can choose for 802.11n with 802.11b/g compatible and a lot of other options. if you have one two, before clicking the dropdown hold ALT(option) to show more options and select 802.11b/g only, if not look for this inside your router/access point. You can check what type of mode you are using holding ALT(option) and clicking on the Wi-Fi icon at the menubar (the same place as the clock), at the bottom you will see PHY Mode, and check there the mode you are connected if is 802.11n or 802.11g. You need to be using 802.11g, and see if your connection will drop.\nI am using 802.11g for a while now and no driver crash. When the driver crashes the only way to reset automatic is to restart the network interface and turn it on again, that's why the Mac do it, but when it returns the bug continues (it can't communicate to the router and no connection is made) and you have to turn Wi-Fi off and on. But it continues because there is a problem with 802.11n. So we have to wait for Apple to fix it and I have been waiting for a long time and no solution yet!\nJust to add info, I have tried everything you can imagine, El Capitan fresh install, do all sort of configuration, disable energy options and etc. but nothing seemed to work for me.

I am able to use the app where the focus is on, e.g. browser but I can not use the Dock or multitask or use any gestures.\nI have already tried to reinstall OS X from Recovery HD. Surprisingly the system downloaded OS X and installed it, but it is not a \"clean\" install. All my apps and settings are still here ... and the problem as well.\nWhat could be the reason for it and how could I track it down to fix it?\n\nA: Don't worry, it's not just you. Many Mac users are experiencing this same issue, including me. It is thought to be a bug in 10.11.4 and I suggest you upgrade to 10.11.5 or downgrade (if you have a backup) to 10.11.3.\nIn my case, I haven't had an issue or a freeze since I upgraded to 10.11.5. It works great.\nSee: http://www.macrumors.com/2016/05/13/macbook-pro-system-freezes-os-x-10-11-4/\n\nA: Apple issued a notice recently about the freezing 13\" Retina MBPs: https://support.apple.com/en-us/ht206594\n\nA: You can start to check what the heck is causing it with the activity monitor and system logs? \n\n\n*\n\n*Launchpad > Other > Console\n\n*Launchpad > Other > Activity Monitor\n\n\nCheck what is taking up all your memory. I have a memory clean app called FreeMemory Pro which checks if memory is low, when low it frees memory, but when doing this everything freezes as this takes all the memory to clear other memory as I set the algorithm to aggressive and not classic.\nSo this is expected, maybe there is an app in the background that is doing the same that you didn't know about. Have a look at Console and Activity Monitor and let us know! :)\n\nA: Unfortunately I was not able to solve it before reinstalling, BUT I found the problem after I have reinstalled the system. The short answer is, the plst of the dock was the problem. Exchanged it, problem gone.\nLong answer: I made a 1:1 image copy to an external SSD and reinstalled the system. Then copied back all the config files. The problem apeard once I exchanged the dock plst. In fact I do believe that Google App Launcher was causing this problem. The icon resisted inside the dock and Google discontinued this app in July which is when the problem started to appear. I removed the app icon and everything was fine. \n", "Q: How do I find out my Mac OSx admin password without changing it? Please help me as I do not want to reset the password. I inherited this mac and I do not know the admin password but i aslo dont want to change it\n\nA: OS X does not store a plain-text copy of your administrator password. This makes it impossible to have the computer show you the existing password.\nOS X can only test if an attempted password is the administrator password.\nOS X has no way to show you the original. The original is immediately thrown away when the password is set; only a hash of the password is kept.\nWhy? Hashed Passwords\nPasswords are stored as mathematically derived hashes of the original. This hash makes it possible to determine if an attempted password matches the real password, but it also makes it impossible to determine the real password.\n\nA: Unless its linked to iCloud, in which case you would be able to reset it as if you'd reset your Apple ID password (not recover it), I believe there is no way of being able to do such thing. Not even change it.\n", "Q: Alarm clock OS X with automator and password on wake up As there is no built in alarm clock in OS X, like in IOS, is there any way to set alarm clock via automator (playlist in iTunes), when Mac is in sleep mode and login password is required?\n\nA: There is an scheduler for sleeping and waking up OS X in System Preferences > Energy Saver > Schedule....\nUnlike the alarm in the iOS you can set timers in Automator with Pause action. It will work even your Mac is asleep. Playing iTunes playlist does not require password for the running Automator workflow. You can make a workflow of pausing until your preferred time and then play your playlist. You should set the scheduler to wake up before the pause passed.\nAfter starting the workflow you can sleep your Mac.\n", "Q: Share link for a photo from icloud or photos app There used to be a way to get a direct link to a photo in iCloud and share it. \nI was surprised to see this still isn't possible from the photos app so i went to the iCloud website and i still can't get a direct link to an image. \nIs it possible to get a direct link to photo in iCloud that i can share with anyone?\n\nA: You can create a public album and share the link to it to anyone, but not to a single image. One solution could be to create a album for each image.\niCloud: Create a shared album\nYou can also place the image file in iCloud drive, view the file in a browser and copy the link to it.\n", "Q: ipa installed on device but not appearing My friend has developed an app and sent me the .ipa file. He wants me to install it on my phone. So I went into iTunes and dragged the ipa into the app section. Then I connected my phone to my computer, and made sure iTunes could access it. After that I went to the app section of my device info. I saw the ipa file I've imported earlier followed by an install button. I clicked on the install button and hit the apply button on the bottom. Now the app finishes copying to my phone and it does display properly in the device's app info's home screen section. But it is not appearing on the actual device. I tried restarting the phone, but that didn't help. I looked back at the row that displays the app, the button changed from 'install' to 'installing' but never changed to anything else. Any ideas? \nEDIT:\nI went into the storage settings and found out there is 40GB of storage left; after I press install it has 39.9GB left, so the app is definitely installed but just not displayed, I can't see it in the Spotlight search either.\n\nA: This IPA application may not have signed for your phone. So you can not launch it in a normal way. Resigning the IPA or patching the launchd in your phone with some packages like AppSync may resolve this.\n\nA: What I did, and what worked for me, was I created a shortcut to open the app. Then after I opened it once, the app showed up.\n", "Q: CPU Die temperatures reaches 90° C, is that normal? My Macbook Air 13\", Mid 2011, got heated and is slow in working. I noticed that CPU Die temperature reaches 90° C, is that normal?\nI've changed my fan recently but still get this issue.\n\n\nA: The MacBook Air 13\", Mid 2011, comes with an Intel Core i5 or Core i7 (2557M, 2677M) (\"Sandy Bridge\") Processor and the maximum temperature allowed at the die is 100° C, per Intel's documentation on both processors.  (See TJUNCTION in the links provided.)\nSo while you have not yet max it out, nonetheless it shouldn't be running that hot except under considerable load. If you'er seeing that high of a temperature under an idle load then it is something to worry about.\n", "Q: How to find apps registered to a different iTunes account An acquaintance of mine bought a used iPhone. The previous owner was a  friend. They installed some apps that the new owner wanted, but used the previous owner's iTunes account for convenience.\nNow she has a new Macbook and wants to connect the iPhone to the iTunes running on it.\niTunes, however, refuses to do so before getting authorization for 10 apps that were registered using the former friend's account. This is what the dialog looks like (in German, sorry):\n\nthe friend is no longer a friend, so there is no way to get their password for the authorization. iTunes won't tell me which the 10 apps are.\nI have no problem with just removing the 10 apps and reinstalling them, but I'm scared that they'll contain important data (like her Whatsapp which is chock full with contacts and chats).\nIs there a way to tell which 10 apps are connected to the previous owner's account?\n\nA: You can go into iTunes on a computer and go into her account. From there you can look at all past purchases (also includes free apps) made with that account. \nFind the apps that are on the device but not in her account. Those will be the apps from the previous owner. \n", "Q: Apple Mailbox appearing in trash and in inbox This morning I got the message \"An error occurred while moving message to mailbox (null)\".\nI discovered my entire mailbox is duplicated under Trash and under my Inbox. Anybody got any ideas on how to repair this? \n\nA: Are you using an IMAP account? If so, remove the account and add it again so it downloads your mailbox entirely from the server. \nDid you find the mailbox tree in your Mail.app trash or in you OS X trash? \n", "Q: How do I make more space on a Macbook air? I have a bunch of files that I don't need. I'm wondering what's taking up all the space. I am tempted to almost format the laptop and start fresh.\nWhat can I do to find out what is taking up all the disk space in my Macbook?\n\n\nA: I suggest using a tool like Space Gremlin to identify files eating up your disk space. \nhttps://itunes.apple.com/de/app/space-gremlin/id414515628?mt=12\nhttp://www.spacegremlinapp.com/\n\nA: Did you check your \"About this Mac\" and the tab \"Other\"?\nAll the files that are not in one of the listed categories.\nThis article talks about what is other and how to clean your mac safely\n", "Q: Planning to test our web application in Safari/Windows 7 instead of Safari/OS X & iOS We got a recommendation to test our web application in Safari for OS X and iOS (iPad). Instead of using a MacBook/iPad will it be the correct way to confirm the compatibility of Safari OS X and iOS if I install Safari in Windows 7 and do testing?\nOr do I really have to use OS X/iOS only instead of Windows 7 to confirm Safari compatibility?\n\nA: Safari for Windows was dropped at version 6, in 2012. It is no longer available for download, directly from Apple, though can be found on several file hosters.\nThe last version of Safari for Windows was 5.1.7, released May 9, 2012.\nI would say testing against such an outdated version would not really be useful at all.\nThere's a long article on resurrecting it for Windows 10 here though it doesn't deal with the comparison in security or real compatibility terms.\n", "Q: How to prevent iTunes/QuickTime Player playing both the main (5.1 AC-3) and backup (2.0 AAC) audio tracks at the same time? I have created for myself a build script to automatically import films into iTunes, making sure that they have compatible audio/video tracks. This generally means that if the input video track isn't H.264, it's converted to it, and if the input audio track isn't DTS, AC-3 or AAC, it's converted to a 2-channel AAC track.\nIn the special case that the input video's audio track is DTS, AC-3 or multichannel AAC, then a second, 2-channel AAC track is added for compatible with iDevices and my Apple TV 3 (which isn't connected to a device which can decode DTS or AC-3).\nGenerally this works well, except that if I play the resulting video on my Mac via iTunes or QuickTime Player, they play both audio tracks at the same time, and there doesn't seem to be an option to switch between them. Making them different languages via metadata works, but I'd rather have them both correct.\nI use ffmpeg to do the necessary format conversions and AtomicParsley to set the iTunes-compatible metadata. I then use a custom AppleScript to import the resulting file and set the media kind to 'Movie' or 'TV Show' (since iTunes always seems to ignore the metadata set in the file and sets it to 'Home Video').\nHow can I create the video file with the preserved high-quality audio track and the backup 2-channel AAC, and get iTunes and QuickTime Player to play only the best-quality track they can (ideally in a way which can be automated)? I've noticed that films from the iTunes store include several audio streams, but iTunes never plays them simultaneously.\nUpdate: Looks like at some point recently iPhones and iPads were updated to include an AC-3 decoder, and so are also playing both audio tracks simultaneously. I wouldn't even bother with the AAC stream if not for the Apple TV (pre 4)!\n\nA: It turns out that streams have a 'default' status, and I guess that this status is copied from the input stream to both the output streams, even though you'd usually only want the high quality one to be the default. All Apple software plays all the default audio streams simultaneously.\nTo fix this, ffmpeg provides a disposition flag which can be 0 or default (see documentation for further options). To have the first audio track as default and the second one not, you would add as parameters:\n-disposition:a:0 default -disposition:a:1 0\n\nHaving the AC-3 stream as default appears to automatically play the AAC stream if an AC-3 decoder isn't available, which is exactly what I wanted.\n", "Q: How to use Bluetooth PAN and WiFi simultaneously in OSX On my Macbook Pro I connect to the Internet via Bluetooth on my iPhone, which does not work when connected to a WiFi network.\nHow do I tell OSX to route WAN traffic over my Bluetooth connection, while still being able to communicate with other machines over WiFi?\n\nA: You should be able to achieve this by making adjustments to your routing table. Have a look at the manual page for route on how to tell your Mac to send your default traffic over the PAN, and traffic for those other machines to your wifi interface. \nOne of your challenges I know from experience is going to be that your Mac will drop them upon reboot. And when you address this and make the routes persistent, the second challenge occurs in that and the routes will get in the way in situations other the one for which you need them. \n\nA: Use Speedify.\n(I don't work for them or have financial interest in them. I'm a user.) \nWhat this software does is to combine multiple internet connections. \nI am combining a bluetooth PAN and Wifi.\nBlue tooth Pan from a Sony Z3 Xperia Compact phone on EE in the UK and Wifi hotspot from another same model phone on Giff Gaff (a MVNO running on O2).\nI'm doing this to get better coverage on the train between London Waterloo and the south coast of England. All operators have their weaknesses (areas of no reception), but I have found that the weaknesses occur in different places, so combining 2 networks improves the overall internet connection to an extent.\n\n", "Q: permission denied mkdir /Volumes I'm getting a permission denied when attempting to create or mount at /Volumes on my mac.

This was not always the case and I don't know why sudo is suddenly being required. \nHow do I go about changing the permissions on /Volumes?\n\nA: There are access control restrictions on that directory. You can inspect those from the command line:\nls -lOe /\n\n(That's a capital letter O and not a zero 0) I would suggest mounting your volume to another directory - either /tmp or $TMPDIR rather than messing with the restrictions that are designed to prevent what you have - an actual directory with actual files in /Volumes.\nWithout knowing your script and workflow, it's hard to guess/advise other than not changing things that Apple will change back next time you patch the system.\nYour vendor of the LTO tapes should have software to handle mounting the volume in a manner that uses Apple's disk arbitration framework so you don't have to manage the mounts in a script.\n\nYou could add a user to have explicit write access in that directory if you're certain that's what will help:\nsudo chmod +a \"User 1:allow:add_subdirectory\" /Volumes\n\n\nA: The default permissions of the directory /Volumes are:\n...\ndrwxrwxrwt@  4 root      admin  hidden  136 Apr 22 22:05 .\n 0: group:everyone deny add_file,add_subdirectory,directory_inherit,only_inherit\n...\n\nI suggest to repair permissions either with Disk Utility/diskutil or a 3rd-party tool and/or modify the permissions manually.\n", "Q: Speed up Automator workflow I've recorded some actions and made an Automator workflow out of it. It's basically some clicks, selecting something in drop-down menues and quitting the app. I run the workflow at 10x speed, but it's still fairly slow. Is there a way to speed it up beyond 10x? It can also run in the background, invisibly, I don't need to see the steps. I don't know if it's possible.\n\nA: Try this alternative approach in Automator. Be sure to back up any PDFs before applying this workflow – the originals will be overwritten.\nIn Automator.app, create a new workflow and add the following actions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ask for Finder Items, with Allow Multiple Selection\n\n*Apply Quartz Filter to PDF Documents, selecting the Reduce File Size option\n\nWhen run this workflow will let you select multiple PDFs and then overwrite those files with reduced file size versions. It performs the equivalent steps as the original workflow, but is faster than scripting Preview.app.\n\nA: Drag the steps from inside the watch-me-do into the main workflow.  This will turn each step into a little Applescript that you can edit.  It uses a different means of clicking menu items that don't involve actually moving the cursor.  There's also a delay in the code that you can edit.  Note however that since it's a different means of clicking menu items, you may need to test it to make sure everything still works as intended.  I've had to increase delays to overcome things like waiting for an app to \"activate\".  And some watch-me-do actions may not be able to be dragged into the workflow and turned into Applescripts.\n", "Q: Why does my Mac slow down when the volume/brightness indicator fades out? I frequently change the volume and brightness on my computer. Usually I modify them to more or less match my surrounding physical(!) environment. But there's this one annoying quirk with changing my volume and brightness.\nWhen the brightness/volume indicator – I'm referring to this thing, by the way:\n\n..fades out, my entire computer's frame rate just seems to drop. For example when I'm playing Minecraft and I'm changing my brightness or volume, the FPS drops down to about 10 from 110. YouTube videos also go from 60FPS to around a few frames per second.\nAny idea what the cause of this is? It seems to be consistent across different Macs, too – I get the same issue on a new MacBook Pro.\n\nA: What kind of OS X version that you are running? (Yosemite or El Capitan?

I regularly put my 2010 Mac Pro under pretty heavy usage, maxing out the 12 core CPUs and GTX Titan Black.  I can monitor the voltage and current using iStat Menus, but I'm looking for a specification of how much current is allowable for each device.  The readings that concern me are Vcore, PVTT, PSU (PSMI), PCIe Slot and Boost.\nI believe this system has a 980W PSU, which is 82 amps at 12V.  The readings shown here add up to much higher than that, but my 120V UPS shows that the whole system is using less than 700W.  Confusing.\n\n\nA: Not all of the listed items have a voltage of 12 V. E.g the HDD+ODD has only 5 V and the CPUs have a much lower voltage. According to Intel the voltage of the Xeon® Processor X5670 maxes out at 1.350 V and the TDP is 2 x 95 W (and not 2 x 12 V x ~46 A = 1104 W).\nSo just adding all currents and multiplying them with 12 to get the wattage is not appropriate here.\n", "Q: How does the Put Back feature of the Trash work? This question is really more for my fellow computer scientists: how does the Put Back feature of the Trash directory work? I'm guessing the OS maintains some sort of index file which stores the path to the current location of the file before moving it to the Trash? Of course, this would be a bit more nuanced with non-empty directories...\nEverything that was returned in an admittedly brief Web search had to do with end-user interaction with the Trash. I would like to know how OS X is doing this \"under the hood\" so that I can emulate the same handling in a script that I am writing.\n\nA: According to https://superuser.com/questions/59376/how-to-tell-where-an-item-in-the-trash-came-from, \"I know the original locations are stored in ~/.Trash/.DS_Store\". .DS_Store is the name of the file that stores various Finder-related information.\nFollowing that question, there is also How do I check where the file in .Trash was removed from? and How to determine original location of file that is currently in the Trash?, which don't quite look like duplicates but talk about some of the details a bit more.\n", "Q: Prevent Network-Discovery on Infrastructure side The Finder displays nearby Computers and Devices in the left column whenever a network connection is present. \nSometimes we let clients use our network when we discuss projects in meetings (aka they bring their Notebooks along). In some cases we would prefer if they couldn't see all the machines and devices in our network. \nIs there a way to prevent the discovery of other network clients on the infrastructure side? I tried blocking Bonjour traffic, however, the Macs are still able to see who's around? \n\nA: It's possible to block Bonjour traffic by configuring pf to disallow:\n\n\n*\n\n*MAC addresses:\n01:00:5E:00:00:FB – IPv4\n33:33:00:00:00:FB – IPv6\n\n*IP addresses:\n224.0.0.251 – multicast IPv4 address\nFF02::FB – multicast IPv6 address\n\n*UDP port 5353\n\n\nHowever, this will also impact your own regular and \"desirable\" hosts.\nOne possibility is to configure a VLAN and set it up as default network for your clients. A VLAN - properly set up - spans its own broadcast domain which can't be bypassed or bridged by Bonjour traffic. \nYou need appropriate devices in your network environment to be able to create VLANs.\n\nA: The computers are not being discovered by Bonjour; they're being discovered by NetBIOS.\nNetBIOS is a common network protocol that all IP-based devices use to announce themselves on the network.  That includes printers, security cameras, phones, etc.  It cannot be disabled on the infrastructure side (well, technically it can but this would break one of the core components of TCP/IP).\nThe only way to prevent someone from \"sniffing\" other computers is to isolate them on a different network.  Since we're talking about laptops here, that means they're connecting via WiFi.  The best course of action would be to set up a guest WiFi network.\nIf you want to make the attempt, the ports you need to block are:\n\n\n*\n\n*TCP port 139\n\n*UDP ports 137 and 138\n\n", "Q: How to get iTunes to copy music you import to a safe/internal folder When I drag music into iTunes from the downloads folder, and then empty my downloads folder, the music is obviously no longer in iTunes because the source file was in my downloads folder.\nThis is on Windows 7, but I don't think that's relevant. I think it's an iTunes setting/preference.\nHow do I set it up so when I drag music into iTunes, it copies the music file to another folder, so I can empty my downloads folder?\n\nA: Launch iTunes then open Preferences, either from the Edit menu or by holding  Ctrl ⌃   ,  \nIn the Advanced tab, check 'Copy files to iTunes Media folder...'  \n\nThis may prompt iTunes to ask if you want to Consolidate existing files. If it does, say Yes.\nIf not, then do it manually afterwards, from File > Library > Organise Library.\nThis will grab all existing files from all locations except the iTunes Library & copy them there.\n", "Q: What's the most effective way to cool down a MBP 13 I have a MacBook Pro 13 retina, which I've just recently started playing Call of Duty on, and I thought if I just blasted my fans the temperature would be kept in check. However, I only checked the actual temp. after playing a bit and it went between 96-100 C (204-212 F). I also have the laptop on raised off of my desk, so theres enough air flow as well. However, the fans don't seem to be enough. Could anyone recommend specific ways or products to cool down my mac?\nThanks!\n\nA: That’s completely normal operating temperature for graphics intensive processes on your machine. The System Management Controller gauges your machine’s temperatures and automatically adjusts the fans accordingly. Furthermore, the SMC will automatically shut your machine down if overheating occurs.\nThird party tools (IE, smcFanControl) used to measure temperature and provide users with the ability to manually adjust fan settings is not recommended at all by Apple. Here’s an excerpt from Apple Support on Macbook Operating Temperature:\n\nWhile there are third-party utilities that measure the temperature of a notebook computer, it is important to understand that these utilities are not measuring the external case temperature. The actual case temperature is much lower. Never use third-party applications to diagnose possible hardware issues. \n\nThe most important thing to do is ensure the back vent isn’t blocked in anyway to ensure adequate heat dissipation. Additionally, keeping your laptop on a hard surface actually helps ensure proper temperature control. \nIf you still feel uncomfortable, there’s a multitude of laptop cooling stations available out there which will safely help cool the machine during intensive use.\n", "Q: What happens when PCIe boost circuits are overloaded? In my understanding, the 2010 Mac Pro is rated for 75W of power for each PCIe slot, plus 75W for each of the two 6-pin boost (aux) circuits.  I know it's possible to exceed these limits, because I do it regularly. At what point does it have some effect, and what is that effect?  I'd like a very specific answer, not just, \"it crashes\".  My guesses:\n\n\n*\n\n*A thermal or power sensor trips and kills power to the offending circuit.\n\n*A sensor trips and kills power to the whole PSU\n\n*The motherboard traces melt and cause a fire\n\n*The OS kills the process that is over-using the GPU\n\n\nObviously, any of these options would cause the computer to crash.

Do I need to issue a separate command to wake the computer up at a specific time?\nThanks\n\nA: Here is a bash script that when run, without an argument, schedules the system to wake in 20 minutes and then puts it to sleep immediately. Or you can supply, as an argument, the number of minutes you want it to sleep before it wakes the system. Unfortunately the OS X command line utility pmset, which does the wake scheduling and sleeping, requires elevated privileges.

For years, it has sync'd very nicely with my Apple Mail folders. Now, several of my Mail folders are no longer syncing with their respective Gmail Label (folder). In some of these folders may show some of the emails stored in my Google Gmail account, but not all. Some other Mail folders are completely empty now despite the fact that their may be 100-150 messages stored in the respective Gmail Label (folder).\nI have tried using Apple's \"Rebuild\" function in Mail, but nothing happens in the Activity window. Any suggestions?\nMacBook Air (13-inch, Early 2014), OS X Yosemite (10.10.1), 16 GB Ram; 480 GB SSD\n\nA: Rebuild does not show up in the activity window, even when it is doing things in the background. I've experienced this first hand in the past. So, give it some time.\nHowever, rebuilding I think only helps rebuild the index file based on the messages stored on your computer. It does not compare notes with the server, I believe. \nHonestly, I would just remove the account and add it again, so that it downloads your entire account back to your computer. Not an elegant solution, but it has done the trick for me a few times. \n", "Q: How to use iMac mid 2010 (21.5 inch display) as monitor I have a late 2014 macbook pro, and i am trying to use my 21.5\" iMac as just a display via the thunderbolt cable. But it doesn't seem to be working, what do I need to change to do so?\n\nA: The Display Port on the 21.5\" iMac is output-only, so you can't use it in target display mode. \n", "Q: No option to boot into windows now I've installed El Capitan I have just upgraded to El Capitan from Yosemite.\nPreviously when holding down the option key I had the option to boot into Windows as I had installed this using Boot Camp. Now it doesn't give me that option. \nAfter installing El Capitan I used the partition tool in Disk Utility to create some free space (the idea being that I would download Mini Tool partition wizard once back in Windows and get some more space). The Bootcamp partition seems to be there as you can see in the screenshot pictures but it just doesn't give me that option of booting into Windows when holding the alt key at start up anymore! \nI changed the start up disk to Bootcamp (Windows) on start up but came up with this message \"No Bootable device - insert boot disk and press any key.\" When press alt key can still only select Macintosh HD. It's Windows 7 and all the installers still seem to be there when I select the bootcamp disk. \nTried turning off the System Integrity Protection (SIP) as recommended by @DavidAnderson but when back in El Capitan it still didn't give me the option to 'first aid' the disk.\nHere's what it currently looks like in Disk Utility...\n\n\n\nA: This guide will help you fix the problem. I had a similar issue on mine. Make sure to back up your entire disk (both partitions) before making any changes though. No joke. Believe me, it's important. Buy an external drive if you don't have any place to back it up. (When people used to warn me to take backups, I didn't listen, and I once lost 6 months of data because of that.)\nPlease also see this answer to find out how to turn off SIP protection in El Capitan. Without turning this off it won't be possible to repair the Master Boot Record.\n\nA: You can have up to two shared partitions between Windows and OS X. The problem is that you have to install Windows and the shared partitions before any OS X partitions.\n\nIn the above image, Windows 10 is installed on Shark, Yosemite on Steelhead and El Capitan on Steelhead2. The partitions occupied by Shark2 and FREEDOS2011 are shared NTFS and FAT32 volumes, respectively. (Yes, I have a working DOS on my Mac.) Also, each OS X has a hidden recovery partition and there are 2 hidden EFI partitions for a total of 9 partitions. (The second EFI partition has rEFInd installed.) The remaining 100 GB of available space used to be occupied by Ubuntu Linux.\nThe output from diskutil list is given below.\nSteelhead:~ davidanderson$ diskutil list\n/dev/disk0 (internal, physical):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *1.0 TB     disk0\n   1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1\n   2:       Microsoft Basic Data Shark                   202.0 GB   disk0s2\n   3:       Microsoft Basic Data Shark2                  202.0 GB   disk0s3\n   4:       Microsoft Basic Data FREEDOS2011             50.0 GB    disk0s4\n   5:                  Apple_HFS Steelhead               245.1 GB   disk0s5\n   6:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s6\n   7:                  Apple_HFS Steelhead2              198.9 GB   disk0s7\n   8:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s8\n   9:                        EFI REFIND                  134.2 MB   disk0s9\n\nSo it is possible to have shared partitions, but this requires either reinstalling OS X or doing a backup followed by a restore of OS X.\nThe other way to share is to have the Windows and shared partitions follow OS X. You then have to use the gdisk command to manually insert the partitions in to the MBR partition table. This is problematic, since an update from Apple can wipe this partitioning scheme. This may result in having to periodically reenter the partitioning information in to the MBR table via gdisk.\n", "Q: Get MAC address from a dead phone I have a 4 years old iPhone 3GS that suddenly stopped working 1 and a alf years ago. It was already out of warranty so I preferred getting a new phone instead of reapiring it. But now I need to get its MAC address, however both on iCloud and using the backup I did on my pc some time ago, but I couldn't find any way to recover it? Is it written phisically on the board and opening the phone could be useful? I still have the serial number if that could help.\n\nA: iPhone original packaging should have the Wi-Fi MAC address in addition to the serial number and IMEI printed on it.  An Apple service desk or service technician might be able to look that up for you, but older devices might be out of the recent database or release of that detail might be considered out of scope. \niOS itself as well as the iTunes back up syncs never need the MAC address, so you would be better looking at Internet logs and router logs and basestation logs since they would record that type of information as a routine auditing function. \nLastly, diagnostic logs from the device might have that information so if you opted into sharing diagnostics with either a third-party developer or Apple, they might have records of your mac address in their databases of crash reports and support incidents. \nOpening the device would only make sense if you could get it to power up and join the network-I would be surprised if the address or visible to inspection internally \n", "Q: iOS Mail wont open zip files I'm on iOS 9.2 on an iPad air 2.\nI understand that since iOS 7 mail should open (for viewing) zip files directly.\nWhat I actually get is just perpetual Loading... and spinning wheel. If I copy to WinZip I can open the file fine.\nIs this expected behaviour?\n....... Further (!) Edited to add the following in response to bmike's comment and add context ......\n5 small to moderate PDF files of business documents, total zipped size 364KB.  Zipped using WinZip 18.5 on desktop Win7. Zip file was attached to an email.\nOutlook 2013 opens the zip file on double-clicking (showing the zip file index).\nInterestingly, Yahoo Mail shows the zip file as \"No Preview\" (download is Ok).\nOn iPad, both the 5 documents, and also a test single document, produce a perpetual spinning wheel when the zip file icon is tapped for native view.\nUsing 'copy to' (touch and hold the icon) with PDF EXpert or to WinZip mobile, either file can be opened successfully.\nI will look for a different zip program on the desktop to see if that makes a difference.\n...\nWhat has me quite puzzled is that Google has turned nothing on this topic, trying various searches.   Which suggests this is a somewhat unique situation.  (Or no one is using Mail App for serious emails ...)\nBut to me this is a very straightforward situation.  And given the facts in the question, the finger does seem to point at Mail.app.\n\nA: After my test (ipad air 2 with 9.3.2) i see that MAIL opens only zip files produced with a MAC OS X.\nWith MAIL we can't open zip files produced on other operating system /app (for example windows or 7zip on windows, etc)\nSo their info \n(\"Supporto allegati email/Tipi di documenti visualizzabili\" on https://support.apple.com/kb/SP708?viewlocale=it_IT&locale=it_IT)\nare not true (or are partially true)\n\nA: I'm not able to reproduce the error as follows on iOS 9.3.1 and an iPad Air 2:\n\n\n*\n\n*print this page from Safari and save as PDF\n\n*print another page as above\n\n\nCompress both on OS X using finder and mail them to myself.\nI even added a screen image (PNG file) to test a mixed zip archive - and all attachments render properly on iOS after a one time \"tap to download\" the attachment in Mail.\nIt could be a temporary issue like space on the device, download error or slow mail server. If you can rule that out, then it might be an encoding error that needs to be reported to Apple and patched. Hopefully it's something you can sort out faster than a bug might take.\n\nA: I have been facing the same problem on iPad air 2 running IOS 10 and updated to 10.3. In both versions of IOS zip would not open in Mail. When I click on the zip file it would open a blank zip with the message zip archive and the size. I figured out that the file has archived file has then got to to be sent to  Documents or WPSOffice app to open it. While it is one step more to be done, it opens fine in the other apps. So looks like zip files created by non IOS systems cannot be directly opened in Mail and have to be exported to another app to open them.   \n", "Q: Does iBooks sync metadata across devices via iCloud? Just updated to using the new iCloud-enabled iBooks for PDFs, etc. On my Macbook, I've also gone and fixed the metadata for all of the books, but it doesn't appear to sync that updated metadata to my iPhone (which is also iCloud-enabled for iBooks). Here's a screenshot from the Mac app:\n\nBut on the iPhone, I'm still missing authors, categories are incorrect, etc. Not sure if metadata simply syncs locally and this is a non-issue, or if something odd is going on w/ my devices. Thanks!\n\nA: Found a solution; not through iBooks but the Terminal instead (must install Homebrew first):\nbrew install exiftool\nexiftool -Title=\"New Title\" -Author=\"New Author\" -Subject=\"iBooks Category\" file.pdf\n\nThis actually edits the PDF metadata, and that will reflect in the Title, Author, and Category columns in iBooks.\n\nA: iBooks does not actually change PDF metadata at all. It may appear to allow you to edit metadata, but the PDFs actually retain their original file names and metadata attributes even after you painstaking edit them. You've essentially wasted your time, as did I. Furthermore, you may notice the utter mess that appears in your Preview folder on iCloud Drive. Some PDFs may appear with \"in iBooks\" under the file names, while others do not, still other PDFs may show up in there that you may have sent or received via email, but never formally added to iBooks. The greatest failure, and iBooks is an epic failure, is that the second you are tempted to organize your \"Preview\" folder on iCloud Drive, it will likely break iCloud sync of iBooks and PDFs across devices. If you are OCD, like me, you will find yourself in an endless feedback loop of fixing ugly metadata and organizing reappearing and disappearing PDFs. You would be better served to stop using iBooks until they fix it, especially if you wish to stay sane. \n\nA: If you already edited a lot of pdf through iBooks (like me) you may want to bulk edit the metadata as stated above. To do this you need to do following steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Get your Books.plist file and convert it into xml-format\nThis file stores all the changes you make in iBooks app on mac. The file is located here:\n/Users/YourUserName/Library/Containers/com.apple.BKAgentService/Data/Documents/iBooks/Books/Books.plist\nIt's probably in a binary format so you need Xcode to open and save it as xml or use an online converter to convert it to human readable xml format.\n\n*Use this metadata to change the actual pdfs\nThen you can parse the xml file with whatever programming language you choose. In my case I used python and following modules to parse the xml and to edit the pdf: defusedxml PyPDF2. Alternatively you can write a bash script around @tylucaskelley's approach just feed your metadata obtained from the xml file into it.\n\n*To trigger the update process you probably have to delete all your iBook pdfs and import the updated pdfs into iBooks again.\n", "Q: Difference between ~/Library/Application Scripts/ and ~/Library/Scripts Does the two folders ~/Library/Application Scripts/ and  ~/Library/Scripts have different meanings? I’m considering where to put scripts for OmniFocus.\n\nA: The \"Scripts\" folder I believe is a relic from the past.\nScripts should now be placed in the \"Application Scripts\" folder. Make a folder within named after the bundle identifier (eg. com.apple.mail), and place scripts that you want to be used for that specific application. \n", "Q: Backing up data I have a script that used to run daily that looked like the following to backup my mac.\nBackup script pastebin\nAs you see here, this script is TERRIBLE because it deletes everything in the folder then pastes it all in. Also if you can't tell im trying to backup to google drive but the limit stops me from updating. I do own a apple timemachine but much rather having a copy in drive. any tips on fixing it?\n\nA: I can't help with the Google Drive question. I can help with a better backup script. I do backups from local disk to local disk using a tool called rsync that comes installed on every Mac and can be accessed in Terminal or using a script like the one you have. \nrsync --verbose --ignore-errors --archive --exclude '.*' --itemize-changes --delete --progress /Volumes/SourceDrive /Volumes/DestinationDrive\n\nHave a look at rsync documentation for explanation of all the options I use. This command will compare your source and destination, copy over files that are not on the destination, remove files from your destination  that are not on the source anymore for whatever reason. \nYou can replace the source and destination above for any folder anywhere on your system, so it should work just fine for Google Drive too. \nI configured cron jobs to have my backup run at night and send my phone a notification every time it completes, so it's all automated. My cloud backups run off the local backups, so they update daily rather than constant. That's a matter of preference I guess. \nPlease note: This command has a clear source and destination, it is not a syncing in two directions. There is no way to undo what it does, deletions are final and not to the Trash. \n", "Q: iPhone 6 plus - weird horizontal lines on screen, won't stay in DFU mode for updates, iTunes stuck \"waiting for iphone\" I need help with fixing an iPhone 6 plus.\nThe user(my mom) accidentally booted the iPhone into recovery mode(not sure, but she says she's holding both power and home button) and leave the phone on as she didn't know how to exit recovery mode. After exiting recovery mode, it started to reboot, horizontal lines appeared on screen, pixels flashes, and the phone showed no sign of booting up. iTunes said the phone had some problems, and told me to update it. So far so good. But as iTunes was preparing the phone for update, display screwed up again and iTunes was stuck waiting for the phone.\nAs far as I know, the phone was using ios 9. It's just a guess though, and I do not know the exact sub-version. \nHas anyone experienced such problem? Any help is greatly appreciated. Thanks.\n\nA: Problem solved- it seems that the battery has been over-drained and a long recharge is needed- I left it charging overnight and it comes to life again after 8 (12 actually, has been charging it before asking this question) hours. This could explain the lines on display- low voltage.\n", "Q: How do you change the order that users appear on the login screen? How would I change it so that one account appears to the right of another in the login screen? I am using the latest software version on a Macbook Air.\n\nA: Technically this isn't possible, since accounts are shown in alphabetical order by default and there's no option to change the sort order.\nAs a workaround, however, if you prefix the full name of an account with a space, it'll sort at the beginning of the list. So for example, if you want to have two accounts called \"Hello\" and \"Test\", but with \"Hello\" on the right, name the other account \" Test\" (note the space).\n", "Q: How can I retrieve my product key without the disc or case? Is there a way to retrieve my product key on my MacBook Pro?  I purchased it from Amazon on August 19, 2011.\n\nA: Your Macbook Pro doesn't have a product number; it has a serial number.\nYou can obtain your serial number by looking at the bottom of your Macbook Pro or by clicking  the \"apple\" at the top of the screen and selecting About This Mac\n\nOnce to select about this Mac, you will get a screen similar to the ones below that will give you your serial number.\nFor Mavericks or earlier....\n\nFor Yosemite and later....\n\n", "Q: How do I remove a ColorSync profile from a JPEG image from Terminal in El Capitan? I have several images that I would like to strip the ColorSync profile from. Eventually, I would like to automate this in bash so I could easily process this on a file or folder from the contextual menu using an Automator service.\nHow do I strip a color profile from an image file using Terminal?\n\nA: Use sips (scriptable image processing system) to remove an ICC color profile from an image file in El Capitan. sips does a ton of other stuff as well.\nTo remove the ColorSync ICC profile from an image:\nsips -d profile --deleteColorManagementProperties <imagefile>\n\nExample:\nMyFILE=\"${HOME}/Pictures/RemoveMyColorSyncProfile.jpg\";\nsips -d profile --deleteColorManagementProperties \"${MyFILE}\";\n\nIt appears to support the following image types, but I'm basing this on the format image property key (see Options in the man page):\n\n\n*\n\n*jpeg\n\n*tiff\n\n*png\n\n*gif\n\n*jp2\n\n*pict\n\n*bmp\n\n*qtif\n\n*psd\n\n*sgi\n\n*tga\n\n\nSee the man page for more info, or use sips -h for help to stdout.\n\nA: OP @Emeraldo's answer is on-target: you can use the sips (scriptable image processing system) terminal command to remove the color profile from a JPEG (or PNG) image. This is often necessary to get colors in an image produced with a graphics app to render correctly in a browser.\nI will add that Apple provides a script that will do this for you without you having to open a terminal or remember the slightly non-trivial command syntax. In /System/Library/Scripts/ColorSync (/Library/Scripts/ColorSync on Catalina) is an AppleScript droplet, Remove.app. If you drop one or more image files on it, it removes the color profile(s). If you open the droplet with Script Editor, you'll find it runs a sips command, just as @Emeraldo described. The original question indicated a hope to automate the process in Automator; this script would be a great starting place for that (if its function as a droplet isn't already enough for the stated batch conversion task).\nI don't know for how long this script has been available, but on my High Sierra system the app file has a 2012 creation data. The script itself has comment giving a 2009 date. So I suspect it's been around for a while. I wish I'd known about it years ago. I used to use a Dashboard widget called \"PNG Pong\" for this, but it's no long available. I learned about the droplet from a 2010 Adobe forum post: How to remove color profile from an image | Adobe Community (though the script's location has slightly changed since 2010).\n\nA: After installing ImageMagick (preferably with HomeBrew), run this Terminal command:\nconvert in.jpg +profile \"icc\" out.jpg\n\nwhere in.jpg is your source image and out.jpg is what you want to name your new image. This command strips the icc profile (but keeps all others) from in.jpg.\nTo see what profiles an image has, you can inspect an image with ImageMagick too:\nidentify -verbose in.jpg\n\nThe profiles are under the \"Profiles:\" section of the output string.

After doing some researching, this was the case of the Mac being used for school ( or it being a school computer ) so I went back to the place where I got the computer, and the store owner said it was non-refundable and someone brought it in a while back. I later found a fix for this, I could boot the Mac by holding command+R and factory reset it, but it requires a \"firmware password\", I have no idea how to get it, any suggestions?\nI've also read that pulling out the ram and reinserting it might reset or fix this, but I'm not sure if the Mac is \"old enough\" for that to work, thanks in advance for any help.\n\nA: \nAfter doing some researching, this was the case of the Mac being used for school ( or it being a school computer )\n\nSchools and other enterprise setups often will set a firmware password to prevent things just like this from happening. If your Mac was manufactured before late 2010 (Apple menu > About This Mac), you may be able to reset it by pulling out the RAM. I'd recommend that you follow the instructions outlined here and use disassembly guides from iFixit.\nOtherwise, your Mac is locked and cannot be recovered without proof of purchase. In terms of ethics, I'd recommend trying to figure out what school it came from and contacting them about this, as this is considered stolen property.\n\nA: Follow the instructions at this address. http://osxdaily.com/2015/01/28/forgot-mac-firmware-password-what-now/\nUse OS X Recovery Mode\nChoose Firmware Password Utility. \nSet to Off. \n", "Q: How can I remotely monitor whether a Mac is connected to the Internet? I'd like to monitor a fleet of machines and be notified when they fall off the Internet (independent of wifi access). Does OS X support this natively? \nIs there a go-to tool that IT folks use to accomplish this?\n\nA: I'd look at osquery for collecting that sort of data from a fleet of Macs. You might whip together something that's more narrow - but this will let you alert on disconnects as well as monitor / detect many other issues that will crop up on a daily basis.\nYou might be a candidate for using Apple Remote Desktop to create lists of hardware and it reaches out to each one and determines online status and can be automated for reporting. If your fleet is less than 2,500 devices, that might be just fine although it starts to become unwieldy or just need some time to complete tasks when you're handling more than a few hundred remote connections for anything but basic operations.\n", "Q: Accidentally ran command to erase volume with \"no format\", how can I get it back?

I'd like to configure an always-on VPN on my iPhone and as always Apple's absurdity gets in the way. Specifically, they require to put the device in supervised mode, which requires Apple Configurator running on a Mac. I don't have any and I do not plan to buy one in the near future.\nI've searched around and it seems like some MDM services allow provisioning of the devices from Windows, which means the supervision process of Apple Configurator has been reverse-engineered.\nNow, I'd like to know if there's other Windows or Linux software that allow switching devices into supervised mode, or at the very least some documentation about the process so I can write my own code to do it.\n\nA: Since you mentioned GroundControl in your link, I would like to make it clear that GroundControl is not an MDM. It is kind of an alternative for Apple configurator. You can supervise many devices at once and also it can be done from a Windows device but physical connection is required. \nAnother way to supervise device is by Apple Device Enrollment Program (DEP). Any device which is purchased directly from Apple or from an authorised re-seller can be supervised through DEP. DEP is the only available option for wireless supervision. DEP requires enrollment in an MDM solution. The MDM will assist in additional device management operations. To know more please check out Device Enrollment Program and iOS supervised mode.\n\nA: In regards to directly answering your specific question, it is not possible to put an Apple device in Supervised mode without using Apple Configurator.app or having your device pre-configured with the DEP (for example from a company).\nYou can confirm this in this rather well-worded post, directly from Apple.\nYou've got some obvious work-arounds, using OSX in a VM or a friend's Mac, etc.  In a comment above, someone recommended this app, which I cannot verify or authenticate.\nMobile phones are by nature, not secure at all.  Even with very advanced, tailored solutions, for example, VMWare's air-watch, one cannot even verify they are secure.  I would highly recommend readers to study the research by Karsten Noel, and others.  In a positive sense, many of the features that make so-called smart phones, convenient, require them to continuously phone-home, whether this is through a 3rd party network like a VPN, or not.\nIf your main concern is to get a complete VPN solution, that is always-on, and routes 100% of your cellular and Wi-fi traffic, without a doubt, through a VPN-tunnel, I would suggest that is not possible at all through an iPhone, with normal hardware; because it's hard to tell without using Wireshark/tcpdump or other tools on all the networks, to see what is happening when the phone comes off and on, or wakes up from sleep, etc., although there are several iOS apps, for example OpenVPN Connect.    \n", "Q: What app is featured in Apple's Chase ad?

Tried editing hosts file, no luck. If all else fails, I'm guessing I'll have to restore and update to 9.3.1 :( Any help appreciated.\n\nA: If you want to avoid having to restore your phone just in order to remove a bad cydia tweak, turn off the phone. Turn it on and as soon as Apple logo appear, hold Volume Up button until your phone boots. It might not work for everyone and for some folks, Volume Down works as well. If nothing works, unfortunately, you will need to restore.\n\nA: BiteSMS's latest version only supports up to iOS 7, so you'll have to remove it (obviously). It's strange that your device didn't just boot into Safe Mode but anyhow all you need to do is boot the device holding the volume down button and it will boot without Cydia Substrate, then remove biteSMS.\n", "Q: Bluetooth MIDI in OS X Mavericks?

I want to use an SSH connection to upload large photo files to a server.  FTP taking 10 minutes per photo.  Someone suggested SSH; I have managed to get the computer connected to the server, but I don't know what to do next.  Shouldn't there be a window showing available files both local and remote server?  Shouldn't I be able to drag and drop from local to specific folder on server?  Where is this???\nThanks for anything helpful.\n\nA: secure shell, ssh, is a command line based method of talking to another computer. By default, there is no graphical interface associated with ssh.\nSpeed\nThe speed of your upload is probably limited by your Internet connection. The protocol used to transfer the files will make a difference but it may not be significant.\nDomestic quality Internet connections tend to have much slower upload speeds than download speeds. This is particularly true for ADSL based connections. VDSL, cable, and fibre connections offer faster upload speeds.\nTry running a speed test on your Internet connection. What values do you see? Is the upload number much lower than the download?\nIf you are transfering thousands of small files, an alternative protocol is probably worth trying. If you are transferring tens or low hundreds of larger files, ftp will likely go as fast as any other method.\nCommand Line - rsync\nFrom your question, it sounds like you have ssh access to your server. This is great. If you are comfortable with the command line, you can use a tool like remote sync, rsync, to perform the file transfer. See Fastest and safest way to copy massive data from one external drive to another for more about this approach. With rsync you will end up issuing a command something like:\nrsync -rv --progress '~/Pictures/My Photos/' user@sftp.server.com:~/Pictures/\n\nAlternative command line tools to rsync include scp.\nGraphical Interface - CyberDuck\nAlternatively, consider using a tool like CyberDuck to connect to and securely transfer files to your server. Try using the same server address as with ftp but instead use sftp; note the addition of an s. This stands for secure. sftp will give you a File Transfer Protocol (FTP) connection over a secure connection, much like ssh.\n\n\nA: \nShouldn't there be a window showing available files both local and\n  remote server?

I have subscriptions of both Apple Music and iTunes Match, but I was wondering if I can cancel iTunes Match...\nWhat will happen if I cancel iTunes Match? Will I still have the benefits of iCloud Music?\n\nA: Apple Music and iTunes Match are complementary:\n\n\n*\n\n*both will allow you to match (and upload if unmatched) your locally owned songs\n\n*Apple Music allows you to stream those songs as well as a good deal (but not the whole) of the iTunes Store catalog without downloading them, or download the matched songs as 256kbps FairPlay-wrapped DRM-encrypted AAC as well as the unmatched ones in their original format.\n\n*iTunes Match allows you to download (and listen as it downloads, even if it is in a temporary cache, which makes it look like streaming) matched songs as DRM-free 256kbps AAC (still wrapped in an thin FairPlay container but inconsequential and unencrypted) as well as the unmatched ones in their original format.\n\n\nSo be very wary with Apple Music matched songs: be sure to back up your original files, or you'll be left with only DRMized ones. You can see the type of match by adding some info columns in the song list view in iTunes.\n\nA: You can cancel iTunes Match and still store up to 100,000 songs in your iCloud Music Library with an Apple Music account.\nSee the Apple Music Membership page for more information.\n", "Q: 21.5 inch retina iMac used as external monitor I am thinking of purchasing this little fella http://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/imac?product=MK452LL/A&step=config# and (also) using it as an external monitor to my MacBook Pro (mid 2014). \nIs it possible?\n\nA: Yes, in the sense you can share the screen over a internet connection. There will be a noticeable small delay as information is exchanged over the internet connection. What you would normally see on the iMac is the same as seen on the Mac Book Pro. The displays would mirror each other. If you had an actually external monitor connected to the Mac Book Pro and you are not mirroring the displays, then what you would see on the single iMac display is what is shown on both the internal and external Mac Book Pro displays. So in this case, the iMac would mirror both the internal and external Mac Book Pro displays. \nNo, in the sense of an actual external monitor. There is no input jack on the iMac like you would find on an actual external monitor.\nOther than this, I do think it is possible for you to buy another computer.\n", "Q: Prevent internal drive from mounting automatically I don't use the internal hard drive on my iMac any more, but for obvious reasons, it's awkward to remove it. I'd like to stop OS X from automatically mounting it when the iMac boots. Is this possible? I didn't see anything in Disk Utility that looked appropriate. I know I can unmount it myself, but I'd prefer if it were never mounted in the first place.\nI found a previous answer that describes editing /etc/fstab. However on OS X 10.11 \"El Capitan\", this file contains only the following information:\nIGNORE THIS FILE.\nThis file does nothing, contains no useful data, and might go away in\nfuture releases.  Do not depend on this file or its contents.\n\n...so that appears to be no longer relevant.\n\nA: 1) Make sure the disk you want to prevent mounting at boot is mounted.\n2) Launch Terminal.\n3) Run the following command to print out information about the disk:\n diskutil info /Volumes/<volume that shouldn't be mounted>\n\n4) Locate the line that starts with: Volume UUID:. Select the UUID (Universal Unique Identifier) that follows on the rest of the line. It will be something that looks like FF9DBDC4-F77F-3F72-A6C2-26676F39B7CE. Your value will be different\n5) Copy the UUID to the clipboard.\n6) Navigate to /etc by typing the following and pressing enter:\n cd /etc\n\n7) Edit (or create) an fstab file by typing the following and pressing enter:\n sudo vifs\n\n8) Enter the following line, substituting the UUID you copied in step 5). (Note: vifs uses the value of the EDITOR environment variable to pick the text editor to use. This article assumes you are using the default value of vim. In vim, starts in command mode. To add a new line, move to the end of the document, and press the o key to append a new line and enter edit mode. Then type the following and press the return key.):\nUUID=FF9DBDC4-F77F-3F72-A6C2-26676F39B7CE none hfs rw,noauto\n\n9) Type escape to return to command mode and then type ZZ to save and exit vifs (or some other method to save and exit if you are using something other than vim.\n10) Type the following and press enter to reset the auto mounter:\n sudo automount -vc\n\n11) Quit Terminal\nNow, the next time you restart, or unplug the drive in the case of an external drive, that volume will not be mounted.

But these workarounds didn't answer the original question. Moreover I already use them but this still leave me with an\nunacceptable error rate.\nFrom my point of vue, the return should never be associated with a \"function\" within an environment where you\nare at typing text.

I have a USB keyboard where I swapped my Cmd and Ctrl keys, because I come from the world of Linux and that's just what I'm used to.\nHowever, this causes a problem in the Terminal because all of a sudden the Ctrl key (used for escapes and whatnot [^C, ^D, and so on]) is in the wrong place. As a result, I keep accidentally pressing the wrong key.\nIs there a way to swap my Cmd and Ctrl keys again only in Terminal (so that the keys are all in the right place)?\n\nA: You may find \"Karabiner\" app to fit your needs. I have used this app for similar reasons as to swap keys with modifiers.\nYou won't find a per app setting in the preferences. You will, however, find a setting where you can switch the left 'command' key with the left 'control' key ONLY in certain apps (ie. Terminal, Chrome, Emacs, etc.)\nYou can do a filtered search for \"terminal\" or \"Command_L\" to specify the effect you are seeking.\n\nA: iTerm2 will let you remap your modifier keys. This has the effect of just remapping them for terminals. Bonus: it's also a better terminal program for OS X than the built-in Terminal.app that ships with OS X.\nYou can alter the modifier keys on a per-profile basis as well. That lets you switch profiles for terminals depending on what you're doing with the terminal so you get the correct behaviour for local and remote sessions.\n\n", "Q: Targeted Display Mode using Henge Docks Vertical Dock I have a 2012 MacBook Pro with Retina Display and a Late 2012 21\" iMac. I just purchased a Henge Docks Vertical Dock, to use at home, and the plan is to pop my MacBook Pro in and then use the iMac in Targeted Display Mode.\nMy question is, will this work?

I'm not sure what happened..\nI attached a pic of its condition.\nDoes it look like a software issue or broken screen?\nCan I buy and change the screen?\nIs it worth it?\n\nA: Theoretically there might be several reasons behind this issue:\n\n\n*\n\n*LCD cable has loose connection, and not attached firmly (highly probable, if you haven't dropped it);\n\n*LCD screen is broken or it's controller went out of order;\n\n*broken screen itself (very not probable, unless you dropped it).\n\n\nI know the simple trick might help for certain cases:\n\n\n*\n\n*a hard slap on the underside or sides of the device – the screen might flicker screen back to life.\n\n\nThe screen has to be turned on, to see if slaps/shocks are helping. You need to watch if anything changes on the screen, flickering changes, it backs to normal, and then again doesn't work, or other symptoms. If you'll see the change - it will help you to diagnose the problem.\nThe screen itself is pretty expensive component in iPad, so the physical replacement would be costly for an old iPad, unless you can do it yourself. In most cases - guys are buying the new device, and the old one - they sell to repair-shops for a spare parts. Of course if you got top-notch version - it's easier to go to official repair-shop for replacement, they will give you warranty as well.\n\nA: This is a hardware problem.  You can replace the screen, either do-it-yourself (there are several online guides) or take it into a place like iFixIt.  Depending on the device, a replacement will cost you between $100-$300.  You'll need to decide for yourself if it's worth it to get the screen replaced or buy a new iPad.\n", "Q: Thinking of getting rid of my laptop Thinking of getting rid of my laptop and using my iPhone / iPad / Apple TV 4 to access files on the PC now by getting a 2TB Time Capsule.\nWill I be able to edit photos, view and edit spreadsheets, etc. on the TB with an iPad Pro as if it is a hard drive? Assuming this is done on my home WiFi network only.\nAlso, I have a large amount of movies and music in my iTunes library, without loading all that on the TB, will I be able to access those as well?  Assuming this is done on my home WiFi network only.\n\nA: Yes, you should be able to do all the things you asked, provided you have the correct apps on the iPad.  It's easier to do these things if you keep your docs in iCloud instead of the network share, though.\nFor instance, I have the MS Excel app and I store all my spreadsheets on a network share or on iCloud.

These machines have essentially identical hardware with only 1 difference - the Pro 11,1 has a 500GB SSD, and the Pro 12,1 has a 1TB SSD. \nHowever, I have run into some problems, and I am stumped. Any advice would be very much appreciated.\nHere is what I have done:\n(1) Create a Carbon Copy Clone of OSX 10.9.5 (Mavericks) running on my MacBook Pro 11,1 using the instructions on the Carbon Copy Clone website. The backup disk in this case is a SanDisk Extreme 500 Portable SSD.\n(2) Test that the machine from which I created the clone (MacBookPro 11,1) can boot from the SSD. This works absolutely fine, with no hiccups.\n(3) Attempt to boot from the SSD on the newer MacBook Pro 12,1 (which is running OSX 10.11.4 - El Capitan). This fails; all that I see is the 'No Access' Symbol\n(4) Update the /System/Library/CoreServices/PlatformSupport.plist file on the SSD boot disk to match that on the MacBook Pro 12,1 based on advice offered at this URL. Now when I attempt to boot from the SSD, I get slightly further - in fact I get past the 'No Access' screen, and I make it to the expected grey screen with the Apple logo; however, at that point things simply hang (in fact the spinning wheel never appears below the apple logo like i would expect).\nI've tried some other things. For example:\n\n\n*\n\n*I tried again from scratch, wiping the disk & re-cloning, several times in fact, just to verify I wasn't missing something obvious.\n\n*I ran a 'Repair Disk' in disk utility on both the drive I want to clone, as well as the SSD backup disk. However, i still get the same problems.\n\n*To eliminate the possibility that this has something to do with the disk itself, I created a clone of the MBP 11,1 on a western digital drive that I have laying around, and ran through steps (1) - (4) above. The Western Digital behaves identically to the SanDisk SSD, leading me to believe that these problems have nothing to do with the External Drive itself.\nAny help would very much be appreciated - The problem suggests that there is some compatibility issues with the Pro 11,1 and the Pro 12,1, given that the SSD boots fine from the Pro 11,1. Anyway, I have been reading many forums, but I am stumped. \n\nA: You say the only difference between the two models is the size of the drive. This is an incredibly naïve statement. Although, I have not checked in depth, it would be a safe bet next model differs in hardware beyond the drive size. \nLet's look at the chronology.\n\n\n*\n\n*OS X 10.9 is released on November 22, 2013\n\n*MacBookPro11,1 is either a Late 2013 or Mid 2014 model. Should be\nshipped with OS X 10.9.\n\n*OS X 10.10 is release on July, 24, 2014\n\n*MacBookPro12,1 is either an Early 2015 model. Should be shipped with\nOS X 10.10.\n\n\nWhen OS X 10.9 was released, most likely this version did not contain the software (drivers) for Macs not yet shipped. So installing this operating system on a future MacBookPro12,1 model should result in failure.\nThe opposite would likely succeed. You should be able to take OS X 10.10 from a MacBookPro12,1 and run successfully on a MacBookPro11,1.\nHow about upgrading OS X on the older machine before running on the newer machine?\n", "Q: Apple Watch no longer displays temperature Since I installed the most recent Apple Watch software version (early April, 2016) the temperature no longer appears on the watch face (-- appears), yet when I press the temperature (on the Apple Watch), it successfully loads the weather channel data.  Why does the temperature no longer appear on the watch face?\n\nA: I've had this issue and I did the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Restarting by holding down both the Digital Crown and Friends button.\n\n*Erasing and restoring the Apple Watch from backup.\n\n*Erasing and setting Apple Watch up as new\n\n\nI hope 1 or 2 works for you, because I unfortunately had to set it up as new.\n\nA: I did restart, but still did not work. I opened my weather app on iPhone and that fixed the problem. The weather app seems buggy with the latest update.\n\nA: I have to continually switch to the next watch face over and then back again, and that fixes it.  Only since the last update.  Annoying.  \n\nA: *\n\n*Do you have a location set up in Weather for iOS?\n\n*Is your watch connected to iPhone or WiFi?\n\n\nThose are two reasons why it may not show correctly.\n\nA: Try that hard restart (the current iteration of the watch OS doesn't have a \"friends\" button), and then set your watch location to either a town close by or—best, if that works—\"present location.\"  I just coaxed mine to register the temperature that way.  I live in a town that doesn't register on the Apple map, for some reason, but when I set the watch to \"current location,\" the name of the town popped up.  If the location you want is greyed out, that's a clue.  02/18\n\nA: Try changing the app at that location on your watch face to another app, from the Watch app on your iphone. Then change it back to the weather app. Just worked.\n", "Q: Email on Iphone tries to send thru old account I have set up two IMAP email accounts on 1 Iphone. Both accounts are set to send via their respective outgoing email server. The first account sends emails properly. The second account tries to send outgoing email via an old mail server that no longer exists.\nI have deleted the 2nd account multiple times and re-added it from scratch each time but it still insists on sending via the old non-existent mail server. Is there some other place where this is stored? Any suggestions on how to fix this?\n\nA: If using the default mail app,\nSettings > Mail, Contacts, Calendars > (pick account) > (click account again) > Outgoing mail server\nYou should be able to configure which SMTP server will be used for the account.\n\nA: I was having the same problem. It turned out that I had not provided a password to send email - it was set to [optional]. Once I entered the password for the smtp server, it switched to sending mail using the new account's smtp server. Very quirky that the mail app tries to send using an old account's smtp server instead of providing a sensible user error message. Hope this helps.\n", "Q: Keyboard shortcut to kill an unresponsive App on Mac OS X Today I faced really tight situation on my Mac with Skype (yes, again!) - it went unresponsive, and was not reacting on standard shortcuts, and I wasn't managed to close the app by standard means. \nI tried to use the keyboard combo:  ⌘ Command + ⌥ Option + Esc simultaneously, but it haven't open the \"Force Quit\" dialog this time.\nI tried to call Activity monitor - but it was not possible either, as the App prevented me switching to something else or to open other applications... no standard means worked, even \"Spotlight search\" was unresponsive by keyboard shortcut. But I knew it still reacted on the keyboard, as caps-lock was working, plus I managed to power off external display, and the to power it on again via keyboard shortcut.\nI'm wondering if is there any fallback for these situations, when an Application is totally unresponsive and prevents me from running other apps? It's the first time the app hanged the whole Mac that heavily, that I was unable to kill it or to open any other application to manage the processes.\nIs it normal behavior at all, I was counting on it not possible to hang the whole system on a Mac, and one App can't make it totally unresponsive (OS X El Captain, 10.11.4)?\n\nUpdate: found such the keyboard shortcut I never used: ⌘ Command + ⌥ Option + ⇧ Shift + Esc held for 3 seconds - forces quit of front-most application... not sure if it would work. \n\nA: There is a way to access your computer, but only using another computer or device on the same network. That device has to support ssh. OSX has it preinstalled, but if you have an iPhone or iPad you will need to install an app such as Prompt.\nYou need to allow Remote Login on your mac, from System Preferences. Click the Sharing icon, then check the tickbox for Remote Login.\nOn the right, there is a list called \"Allow Access for\". Choose \"Only These Users\". Then click the + icon and add your user in the list.\n(As there was a comment that this is a security risk, you may want to prevent external ssh access in your router, this is beyond the scope of this answer.)\nThen if your mac freezes you can remotely connect to it via ssh from the other devices.\nFrom there you could run top to see a list of the processes. You can use the killall command to stop the frozen process by name.\nFor example\nkillall Skype\n\nThis attempts to Quit Skype.\nIf that doesn't work, you may have to be less “polite” and add a -9 signal:\nkillall -9 Skype\n\nIf it is severely frozen, the computer may not even respond to the ssh request. In that case I would look at reinstalling your OS or have the hardware checked, which is beyond the scope of this answer.\n", "Q: AirPrint printer sharing using Apple TV I have a WiFi printer that does not support AirPrint.  Currently, I use a linux system with CUPS to share that printer to my iOS devices.  I'm thinking about replacing this linux box with an Apple TV for media playback, and it would be great to keep the print support too.  I understand tvOS allows third-party apps to be written and installed using Xcode, so are there any existing apps that can do this? \n\nA: You can't directly print from an Apple TV to a wireless printer.  I'm not aware of any apps that do this, either.\n\nA: Fbara is correct. You cannot print from an AppleTV. In looking at the current APIs that are inherited from the iOS platform I do not see anything that looks like it would be able to support printing. Apple does tend to lock these types of devices down. If you are interested in the types of apps that you could code and what APIs are available please see this Apple Developer article here.\n", "Q: Error message from calendar program When I log into my computer I get this message from my calendar program:\nThe server responded with an error.\nThe request for account \"iCloud \"failed.\nThe server responded with \"412\" to operation\nCalDAVCalendarSplitDualTypeCalendarQueueableOPeration.\n\nWhat does this mean and how do I fix it?\n\nA: I just got off the phone with support and now it's fixed.

This sounds too good to be true. Is there any downside to this?\n\nA: The \"downside\" is that you lose the hardware. That's Apple's entire incentive for offering this exchange feature. If you're ok with the reality that you must exchange the phone you \"half-own\" in order to receive a new model early, there is nothing further that should stop you.\n", "Q: Does anybody know how long installing El Capitan onto a USB 2 pendrive from another USB 2 pendrive takes on a MacBook Air? I'm trying to resucitate a discarded 2013 11″ MacBook Air with no internal drive and hence no OS.\nThe Apple Store Genius bar tested it and found the only problems to be the missing drive and broken display backlight.\nSince I don't know if it's worth spending money on I'm doing an OS install to test it. We got Safari working with Wi-Fi from the installer so we know it does run.\nBut I only had USB 2.0 pen drives. We have the OS installer on an 8 gig one and we are installing to a 16 gig one.\nThe progress bar moved very slowly and the estimated \"time remaining\" was hilariously wrong. The progress bar eventually reached 100% and the time estimation went away but the USB activity light is still flickering with activity.\nI know USB 2.0 is very slow, especially for writing and especially for a large amount of data. The install has been going for about 43½ hours so far with no error messages but also no other clues as to whether it's still going OK apart from the USB activity light.\nI know this is an unusual situation and there are faster ways to do it but require spending money before knowing how well the machine will work.\nDoes anybody know or can find information from somebody who's done this before about how long it ought to take?\n\nA: I've never done this before, but from the looks of it, the speeds will be limited by how fast your thumbdrives go.\nIf I remember correctly, an El Capitan install is around 8-10 GB in size, so the 16 GB one you're installing to should be sufficient.\nUSB 2.0 in reality can IO data at around 30-40 MB/s (although this depends on the make and model of your pendrive).\nUsing these factors we can calculate that an installation can take up to 6 hours for copying alone, not factoring the CPU overhead in installation.\nAlthough 72 hours is a bit of a stretch, as long as your USBs remain flashing I would be fairly certain the system is doing something and not worry about it halting.\n\nA: I have just done this with El Capitan and an 8GB ancient thumb drive and it took precisely One hour and 15 minutes...\n\nA: I was creating a bootable disk for High Sierra and I do agree the copy time was bit longer than expected. However it got over in 30-45 minutes..The entire process took around 1 hours and few minutes or so.\nMy guide: https://support.apple.com/en-in/HT201372\nI followed the exact same steps and it worked fo me.\n\nA: In my experience, it takes about two days.\nHere's why I don't have a more precise answer:\nI actually don't yet possess a magsafe2 power supply and have been testing and restoring this computer with borrowed ones when I can get one from a friend intermittently.\nMore than half way through the second day of install I had to return the power supply and the install kept running with the destination USB stick's LED still blinking for hours until the battery ran out of power.\nWhen some time later I was able to borrow another power supply the machine did boot up into OS X El Capitan.\nSince it was running out of a USB 2.0 pen drive it was exceptionally slow and any glitches may have been as a result of either an incomplete installation or OS-internal timeouts due to running far slower that it was ever intended to run.\n", "Q: Trying to compile thttpd 2.27 on Mac OS X 10.11 I'm trying to compile thttpd 2.27 on Mac OS X 10.11 from source, but when I issue: \n./configure\n\nIt shows:\ncreating cache ./config.cache\nchecking host system type... configure: error: can not guess host type; you must specify one\n\nI try to search online, someone said I should copy some files from /usr/share/libtool/config* but the path does not exist in Mac OS X 10.11.\nHow can I resolve this problem?\np.s.

I have several email accounts on a Mac. \nWith a simple IMAP account, the messages are in /Users/[user name]/Library/Mail/V[a number]/IMAP-[email adress]/INBOX.mbox/\nHowever, Apple Mail seems to hide the messages away differently if you are using gmail. If I go to the same folder scheme -- nothing there.\nIdeas?\n\nMore specifically, I am looking for a way to find only the Sent messages. I have been able to locate an ALL messages folder at:\n/Users/[user name]/Library/Mail/V3/IMAP-[email address]@imap.gmail.com/[Gmail].mbox/All Mail.mbox/\n\nBut how do I separate out the sent messages? \nThe Sent Mail.mbox directory only has a .plist file in it even though there are thousands of sent messages. Doing a file count on the All Mail.mbox makes clear that that is literally all the mail (sent, received, drafts, etc) Looking at the .emlx header it is not obvious what would differentiate one from the other.\n\nA: The URL you state is by and large correct, but the details can differ based on your exact configuration. On my machine (which runs El Capitan, uses V3 in the mail path, and for a Gmail account where the IMAP Path Prefix is set to [Gmail]), the messages for the inbox are stored in the path you stated but messages for other standard folders are in the path MrWonderful suggested. \nThe easiest way I think is to send yourself an email with a unique string (ideally without spaces) as the subject) and to get creative on the command line. \nfind . -name '*emlx' | xargs grep 'UNIQUE_STRING' -ls\n\nThis finds all messages and subsequently searches them for the string, spitting out only the file names (with path) for the files containing that specific string.\nHope this helps you dig around the mail folder and find the information you're looking for.\n\nA: Mine are in a similar location, although the final folder name is slightly different than where you were looking.\n\n/Users/{user name}/Library/Mail/V{number}/IMAP-{email address}/[Gmail].mbox/\n\nIn the above, the curly braces denote variable strings based on your own situation, but the square braces around 'Gmail' are literal.\n", "Q: Using 'alias' in bash script in OSX I write some scripting and I want to make it work on Linux and Mac.

From bash(1):\nAliases are not expanded when the shell is not interactive, unless the expand_aliases\nshell option is set using shopt)\n\nSo the script still calls the standard readlink which doesn't know about --help.\nInstead of setting expand_aliases (which you have to remember to do so on each system and which may lead to unexpected side-effects in other scripts) I would recommend to use functions instead:\nfunction my_readlink() {\n    greadlink \"$@\"\n}\nmy_readlink --help\n\n", "Q: Why cannot I see any browsers in system preferences?

Using smb3 won't make a difference.\nServer-Side Fix\nIf you have control of the smb server (Samba?) then you can fix this issue by enabling the vfs_fruit module.  If you are not using Samba then you'll need to find another way to enable \"Alternate Data Streams\" (ADS) and intercept OSX's \"special\" streams: AFP_AfpInfo and AFP_Resource.  I made notes of all the details at the plazko.io blog.\nOn Samba server you can fix the issue by enabling vfs_fruit in smb.conf like this:\nvfs objects = fruit streams_xattr\n\nFrom the vfs_fruit manpage:\n\nThe module enables alternate data streams (ADS) support for a share,\n   intercepts the OS X special streams \"AFP_AfpInfo\" and \"AFP_Resource\"\n   and handles them in a special way. All other named streams are deferred\n   to vfs_streams_xattr which must be loaded together with vfs_fruit.\nHaving shares with ADS support enabled for OS X client is worthwhile\n   because it resembles the behaviour of Apple's own SMB server\n   implementation and it avoids certain severe performance degradations\n   caused by Samba's case sensitivity semantics.\n\nImportant note for novices: This fix needs to be done on the server side.  If you do not have control of the smb server (presumably Samba) then you will not be able to use this fix.\nClient-Side Fix\nIf you do not have control of the smb server, then your only option is to change the way the OSX client is handling smb.  The only way to do that is to replace Apple's implementation of the smb stack with Samba.  I have never done this, but there is a tutorial here.\n", "Q: How can I use Availability Panel in Calendar?

They are stored in Macintosh HD (I originally thought I will find Macintosh HD in a subfolder of OS X Base System - wrong assumption). There was no Macintosh HD in Volumes folder, because I first needed to unlock it (I use FileVault).\nFirst you need to find the lvUUID of your Macintosh HD.

How can I copy the data if there is no Macintosh HD to navigate to?\nThis is the output from diskutil list\n\n\nA: Your main volume is encrypted with FileVault and still locked – consequently it doesn't show up in /Volumes. Before being able to mount it you'd have to unlock it:\ndiskutil cs unlockVolume lvUUID #replace lvUUID by the one shown in the diskutil listing\n\nYou will then be asked to enter the passphrase/password. You have to enter a passphrase or a password of a regular user eligible of unlocking FileVault. In your example the lvUUID is shown in diskutil list and starts with 573…. You may also get the lvUUID by entering diskutil cs list.\n", "Q: Renaming files/names in bulk, any smarter solution?

The first step was to copy the list of files from search results into a spreadsheet. Since you already have the spreadsheet, you are very close to having a script that can do the renaming for you. \nLet’s assume you have old names in column A and new names in column B. \nWrite the following into the first cell of column C:\nmv\n\nWrite the following into the first cell of column D:\n=concatenate(\"\"\"\",A1,\"\"\"\")\n\nWrite the following into the first cell of column E:\n=concatenate(\"\"\"\",B1,\"\"\"\")\n\nInstruct spreadsheet application to “Fill > Down” column C, D and E.\nThen copy all data rows from columns C, D and E. Paste the copied text into a text editor. You should get row reading:\nmv \"old file name\" \"new file name\"\n\nThis command will move/rename the file named “old file name” to “new file name”. Warpping the file names in double quotes allows for file names containing spaces.\nIf you are satisfied with the commands, copy-paste the complete text to the shell in Terminal.app\nThe procedure is admitedly less elegant that having a script process your spreadsheet or CSV. It however has the advantage of you getting a chance to double-check the commands before running them. When working from search results, you can easily get values from other columns (e.g. modification date, image dimensions, etc.) and work these into the new file names.\n\nA: *\n\n*export into a CSV (unicode UTF-8 or any other 8bit encoding, not UTF-16): two columns, separated by ; (assuming there is no ; in a file name) \n\n*open Terminal\n\n*change to folder containing the files\n\n*run perl -pi -e 's/\\r\\n/\\n/;' LISTOFNAMES.csv to fix CRLF issues\n\n*run while IFS=\\; read old new; do mv \"$old\" \"$new\"; done < LISTOFNAMES.csv\nPS: This will overwrite existing files if the new name already exists.\nPPS: Test this on a temporary folder with just a few files first (and make sure you have a recent backup)\n", "Q: Recover Deleted Voice Memo I was trimming a just recorded Voice Memo and accidentally kept the part I wanted to delete instead.\nIs there any way to get the original file back?\n\nA: Once it's deleted, it's gone.

I've tried opening the console log and looking for XML errors and I don't see any; similarly I've run the file through a web service to check the XML which didn't turn up any problems. My best guess is that there's some problem with the XML produced by heavy editing, but I'm not finding it. How do I fix this? \nI'm running OS X Yosemite 10.10.5 and Ukelele 3.0.3.70. \nLink to the problem file.\n\nA: In my opinion, you need a «your_language.bundle» in the /Library/Keyboard Layout/, which contains your \"PhysicsType1 (MathPhysics)\"\nThen\nTry pressing the \"+\" in the System Preferences> Keyboard> Input Sources, and then select the language in the list that appears, select your \"PhysicsType1 (MathPhysics)\"\n", "Q: How to lock screen OSX without setting “immediately” in Security & Privacy settings I would like to lock my OSX screen at any time, irrespective of whether \"Immediately\" is configured in the general tab in Security & Privacy settings.\nIs this possible?\nThanks\n\nA: The Keychain Access App is located in the Utilities subfolder of the Applications folder.\nIn the Keychain Access App, open Preferences and under the General tab you can tick the box Show Keychain status in menu bar. It'll put a padlock symbol that's resident in your menu bar that when clicked will provide you with a menu, the first menu item is Lock Screen. After setting the preference you can exit the Keychain Access App.\nYou can select the menu item to lock your screen.\n\nA: To lock your Mac’s screen, simultaneously press the following keys: Control + Shift + Eject. If you have a newer Mac that doesn’t have an optical drive (and thus has no eject key on the keyboard, such as the Retina MacBook Pro), the command is Control + Shift + Power. \nIn both cases, you’ll see your Mac’s display shut off immediately, while the system continues to run in the background.\n", "Q: Which is more durable. CPU or FAN? i wonder which of the two components (CPU & FAN) is more durable in a Macbook Pro Retina 2015 (13 inch).\nI am asking because i am doing a lot of compiling on my machine and it gets very hot (up to 100°C) frequently. The fan seems to kick in a bit late in my opinion. Sometimes i hit the 105°C and then the fan starts blowing at full power. \nNow i was thinking of using a manual curve setup for the fan, like 100% power at 95°C.\nBut then i started asking myself if i would brake the FAN quite fast. Well, thats the point.\nWhich one is more durable. Should i live with high temps or high fan speed?\n\nA: The MacBook Pro can get quite hot and the fan may often spin at high speed and this is considered normal operation. In addition to it's fan it also dispels heat via its unibody aluminum shell. This can make the surface very hot but this is often a good thing as it is moving heat away form the CPU and other components. As long as the ball bearing does not get clogged with dust then it should last a good long time even when running at high speeds. The MacBooks all include temp sensors which will power the MacBook off if it exceeds the heat tolerances. \nI think the question is not phrased quite right because as long as the fan does not fail and it keeps the CPU cool, then it will last for many, many years. And as long as the ball bearing doesn't wear out or the blades become unbalanced you will get years of service from your fan. Does this help?\n\nA: MacBook Pro Retina 13\", Early 2015, comes with an Intel Core i5 or Core i7 (5257U, 5287U, 5557U) (\"Broadwell\") Processor and the maximum temperature allowed at the CPU Die is 105° C, per Intel's documentation on these processors. (See TJUNCTION in the links provided.)\nSo if it's the CPU Die temperature that's reaching 105° C then your Fan should be in running full on to keep the temperature from going over 105° at the CPU Die, otherwise it won't matter which is more durable as the CPU has the potential to be damaged running at temperatures above 105° C at the CPU Die.\n", "Q: Command to erase a file permanently There is a command to erase a file without send it to the trash?\nI am pretty sure that i don't need some files anymore.\nI want to clean my storage. Do I need to send those files to the trash?\n\nA: I'm not sure how confident you're going to be using Terminal commands as a brand new user, so I wouldn't recommend doing anything that can permanently, no questions asked, delete data from your hard drive. \nIt would be far safer to delete files to the Trash using the standard Finder command\n Cmd ⌘   Backspace ←  . \nThen when you are happy you really didn't need the files, again from the Finder\n Cmd ⌘   Shift ⇧   Backspace ←    will empty the trash.\nThat in itself wouldn't securely erase, preventing all recovery efforts; but from a standard user perspective, they would be gone & the hard disk space freed up to be used again.\n", "Q: Is it possible to shorten the time between uploading an ipa to iTunesConnect and it becoming available? The last release time to TestFlight was:\n\n\n*\n\n*30 seconds build time.\n\n*4 minutes uploading a 5mb binary.\n\n*19 minutes waiting for iTunesConnect to make it available.\n\n\nIs there something we can do with xcode to help apple along or is it completely out of our hands? Right now we end up with a reverse pomodoro technique when we're at the tail end of the work. :)\n\nA: For TestFlight, there's nothing you can do.  However, after the first upload, and Apple's had a chance to do a cursory review, the availability will go much faster.\nFor submissions to the App Store, there's only 1 way to make this process go (a little bit) faster and that's to request an expedited review.  You would need to justify the quicker review time to Apple, although the rules are fairly lax.  You can do this several times a year but after a few of them Apple might not grant them.\nHere's what Apple indicates are the valid reasons for this request:\n\nExpedited App Review\nIf you face extenuating circumstances, you can request the review of\n  your app to be expedited.

I do not believe she had her find my phone on.   She went on to find friends through the icloud and it is showing  a location for her phone.  We are wondering if this is actually where her phone is. Or what is the app basing this information on.\n\nA: If she didn't have Find Friends turned on (it is on by default so she would've had to turn it off) then what you're seeing is the last location the iPhone reported whenever it reported it's location last.  \nIf she's looking at it thru iCloud, perhaps she does have the Find My iPhone installed.  This is where a user can locate their own device.  The device needs to be on and online to report its location.  If she see's her iPhone and it has a green dot, that means it's currently online.  If it's a gray dot, the iPhone is offline.  If it last reported its location within 24 hours, you'll see the date/time.  If it's longer than 24 hours, you'll just see 'offline'.\n", "Q: Mac OSX EFI problems, urgent help needed! So, I recently did an update on OSX, booted my computer up and I discovered that I the update replaced my EFI boot rom and the SMC with the incorrect SMC, so now I can't use my battery and the computer is generally acting very strange.\nI have looked all over the internet for some kind of answer on how to resolve this with no luck, or the solutions i have seen / found have been outdated and not appropriate for my Macbook Pro.\nSo essentially I have a Macbook Pro 13\" late 2011 8,1 running OSX 10.9.5 the EFI and SMC for this is meant to be:\nEFI MBP81.0047.2AB (2015-001)\nSMC: 1.68f98 (SMC 1.5)\nHowever, the SMC and EFI that I am seeing is this:\nEFI: MBP81.0047.B2A (2015-001)\nSMC: 1.68f99 (SMC 1.6)\nWhich is for the Macbook Pro 17\" Early 2011 8,3.\nDoes anyone out there know how to resolve this I'm losing my mind over this since Apple refuse to tell me how to do it and the only option they are providing me with is a new Logic board, which we all know is not necessary.\nI would genuinely appreciate a guide on how to solve this issue.\n\nA: Go to the following websites:\nhttps://support.apple.com/kb/DL1823\nhttps://support.apple.com/kb/DL1474\nDownload and install the firmwares starting with the EFI. Here we are going to restart the same installation so we can run some diagnostics and hardware tests. \nAlso, two things should be explained before we can continue:\n1) Mac OS X has no BIOS but essentially a proprietary version of EFI. EFI was developed by Intel back in the 90s and later a new set of specifications called UEFI were made. UEFI 2.xx was made and development continued under this forum founded offset branch. Apple took in EFI and developed their own versions off of it.\n2) The boot processes is different than most computers. A piece of firmware called the BootRom starts the Power-On Self Test and then starts the EFI. The EFI chooses the default disk partition or allows you to choose it manually. After the partition is selected, the boot.efi boot loader then loads the kernel. Apple considers the I/O kit as a part of the kernel. So if the EFI improperly loads the kernel, then you could be having driver issues.\nNow to go through a run a diagnostics test and hardware test. Fully power off and power on while pressing and holding the \"d\" key. This will either run diagnostics or a hardware test. I need you to follow the directions below for either one you booted into. Then do the same except power on pressing and holding \"alt/option\" and \"d\" at the same time. Again, reply back with what was found.\nWhile in the hardware test: plug in the AC adapter, choose your language (skip if this doesn't appear), select \"Perform extended testing\", click the test button, reply any errors (there shouldn't be any) you found, reply everything you saw in the test, and exit after the test by pressing \"Shutdown\" or \"Restart\" at the bottom.\nWhile in the diagnostic test: plug in the AC adapter, choose your language and press the \"return/enter\" key (skip if this doesn't appear), reply back any issues found, and exit after the test by pressing \"Shutdown\" or \"Restart\" at the bottom.\nIf no issues are found, restart and check the Boot ROM Version and SMC Version under \" > About This Mac > Overview > System Report > Hardware\" to see if it finally matches MBP81.0047.2AB and 1.68f98. Reply if they don't. Then go to Diagnostics under \" > About This Mac > Overview > System Report > Hardware > Diagnostics\", and there should be a Power On Self-Test and maybe some other tests. Reply any tests that have not passed.\n", "Q: How to know that an iPhone that I purchased from a third-party is not JailBroken? Say, I purchased an iPhone (not from Apple or any official reseller.)\nHow do I know that it's not Jailbroken?\nPS. My concern is the presence of key loggers or other tracking software.\n\nA: Not being familiar with jailbroken phones I can't offer a \"what to look for\" hint but really all you have to do is hook it up to iTunes and reinstall the latest OS update.\n\nA: The best way is to go into Settings>General>About and scroll down until you see Serial Number. Apple has a verification website Here to determine if the iPhone you bought is authentic. All you have to do is enter your Serial Number. If it comes back with \n\n\"We're sorry, but this serial number is not valid.\"\n\nThen your phone is non-authentic and fake.\n\nA: Try looking for the app named Cydia, you can use Spotlight to search for it. It is a standard app that's installed once iOS has been jailbroken and it cannot be deleted nor uninstalled.\n", "Q: Cannot sync with iTunes: This computer is no longer authorized for apps that are installed on the iPhone I'm not even trying to sync apps.

I need to restore my Apple Mail messages and mailboxes from Time Machine.  Where can I find these files on Time Machine?\n\nA: The Mail.app stores all Messages in your User Directory:\n~/Library/Mail/\n\nDepending on your OS Version there is a Subfolder, f.e. \"V3\" for 10.11 and \"V2\" for 10.10., containing Subfolders for each Mailbox. \nThe Library Folder is usually hidden, but you can access it in the Finder from the Menu \"Go to\" > \"Go to Folder\" (or CMD+SHIFT+G) and typing in the Path listed above. \n\nA: You can actually restore mail messages directly inside Mail. Make the Mail application active, then enter Time Machine via the menulet. Works similar to file recovery in Finder.\n", "Q: Can I update my iPad to 9.3.1?

I really need to send texts and iMessages from my laptop (it works on my iPhone and iPad fine).  Is there a non-Apple application I can use for this?  I can see multiple reasons why one would not exist, but I thought I should ask.  Thanks!\n\nA: Mac is a closed system, and Apple takes many safety precautions to ensure that it stays that way, and that nothing is tampered with. Though there are indeed many ways, they all come with a consequence. My advice would be to schedule your Mac for an appointment at the nearest Apple Store and have them take a closer look at it. To schedule an appointment, you can either call in or go to their website apple.com/retail/geniusbar and follow the steps accordingly to your problem. This is the best way to get everything set back to normal.\n", "Q: Automator/Applescript using Tags I need an Automator/Applescript to move a file to a certain folder based on a specific tag it contains.

I want to get a growl notification any time my internet connection changes state - for instance, when wifi comes online, wifi goes offline, or when I switch from wifi to wired. I would love it if there was already an app out there that did this, but I'm definitely open to home-baked solutions. Any pointers?\n\nA: I have a home-grown script that uses a rather inelegant polling mechanism to identify open network connections, and takes action based on what it finds. In short, it turns my wifi on or off depending on if it's plugged into a LAN. This to avoid connecting our corporate LAN with our visitors wifi. It uses ifconfig to obtain this data. \nIt's fairly easy to identify which interface routes your public internet, using netstat -r I think. \nTo the determine if the connected internet is actually working, I would probably using ping -c 1 www.google.com or something and see which code ping exits with to determine if it's alive. \nAll very \"sticks and strings\" I'm afraid. But you did say you're open to that!\n", "Q: iTunes FileSharing Two-Way? I use iTunes File Sharing (on Windows) to share a password file with an iOS app KeePassMini.\nI am not sure if this is a one-time thing or if iTunes copies the files whenever it changes.\nIdeally, iTunes would copy the file back from the device if it was changed on the device and copy it again to the device if the file was changed on the client.\nIn case of a conflict either the older file should be overwritten, or the action set that always the device \"wins\". Or alternatively just ask the user.\n\nA: The iTunes File Sharing feature was the first option Apple supplied to allow manual transferring of files to installed 3rd party iOS apps, which support that feature.  The main reason was (and still is) to put documents into an app or get them out again.\nThe handling of uploaded (imported) files is wholly controlled by the app allowing this feature.\nAs a comparison:\n\n\n*\n\n*Numbers (by Apple):\n\n\n*\n\n*Allows files to be uploaded\n\n*Uploaded documents will be moved to a place inside the app outside the reach of iTunes File Sharing, but can be placed back for retrieval (e.g. after having worked on them on the go)\n\n\n*TeamSpeak (by TeamSpeak Systems GmbH):\n\n\n*\n\n*Allows to upload identities to be used with servers you like to connect to\n\n*Once placed in there, the file will be read and worked on upon start of the app and removed from the upload location, disallowing any identities to be extracted\n\n\n\n\nSince this feature was not meant to synchronize files from inside the app with versions outside the app (e.g. on the computer), there is no synchronization databank holding records of file information in order to determine which is newer.\nFurthermore, iTunes is limited on what one can do with a script to automate processes.  Utilizing the File Sharing feature is not among the scriptable parts of iTunes.\nDue to the lack of features, many app developers (including Apple) expanded to use different means to transfer files and even synchronize them.  Many apps, if they do not use SMB, AFP or WebDAV (HTTP), use their own propriety server system to synchronize across devices.\nWith the introduction of iCloud, Apple allows even 3rd party apps to sync in-app content.  This feature needs to be supported by the app itself to make use of it.\n", "Q: Creating a Mac app bundle I'm trying to create a Mac app bundle,\nSo I did this,\nmkdir -p android.app/Contents/MacOS/\ncp /path/to/myscript.sh android.app/Contents/MacOS/android\nchmod +x android.app/Contents/MacOS/android\nSetFile -t APPL android.app/Contents/MacOS/android\n\nBut when I do open android.app, it prompts me The application cannot be opened because its executable is missing.\nThat's totally weird.

Consider mastering the steps you want via Terminal.app – with the help of the Git Book.\nBitBucket support provides a wealth of examples and workflows to try and to learn from. Once you trust that process, automating via AppleScript will be much easier.\nFixing the Shell Script\nTo get you started, there are is a problem with the AppleScript. The script passed to do shell script will return an error:\ndo shell script \"cd /Users/mainuser/Desktop/Projects git add -A\"\n\nWithin these quotes you are issuing two commands: one to change directory, and the second to add files to git. These two commands need to be separated with a semi-colon:\ndo shell script \"cd /Users/mainuser/Desktop/Projects; git add -A\"\n\nA better approach still, would be to tie the commands together with &&. This will mean that if the first command fails, the second command is not performed. This approach deals with the problem of a missing or renamed directory:\ndo shell script \"cd /Users/mainuser/Desktop/Projects && git add -A\"\n\nAlternatively, to avoid working directory concerns try passing the full path to the git commands:\ndo shell script \"git add -A '/Users/mainuser/Desktop/Projects'\"\n\n", "Q: Create hybrid MBR/GPT just like Bootcamp Assistant does Currently I have two partitions with data on them I would like to keep (marked with a *):\n/dev/disk0 (internal, physical):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *250.1 GB   disk0\n   1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1\n   2:                  Apple_HFS Macintosh SSD*          164.2 GB   disk0s2\n   3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s3\n   4:                  Apple_HFS Additional_Storage*      56.6 GB   disk0s4\n   5:       Microsoft Basic Data                          28.4 GB   disk0s5\n\nNow I would like to install Windows on /dev/disk0s5.

When I booted into recovery mode, I could open the terminal and run ./gptsync /dev/disk0. This created a hybrid MBR/GPT and allowed me to install Windows.\n\nA: The problem is not that you don't have an MBR.  The problem is that an MBR can only have 4 partition entries.  On an out-of-the-box fresh install of OS X, you'd be using 3 of those partition entries already; one for the EFI partition, one for the Mac HFS partition, and one for the recovery partition.  That leaves only one MBR slot available for the Boot Camp Assistant to work with in order to install Windows.\nIn your situation, you have an additional Data partition called \"Additional Storage\" that is taking up the 4th slot.  Since your Windows partition is the 5th partition on the disk, the MBR cannot handle this, nor does the Boot Camp Assistant know what to do in this scenario, so it refuses to work.\nThe solution is to manually use fdisk to make your partition table look like this:\nDisk: /dev/disk0    geometry: 30401/255/63 [488397168 sectors]\nSignature: 0xAA55\n         Starting       Ending\n #: id  cyl  hd sec -  cyl  hd sec [     start -       size]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n 1: EE 1023 254  63 - 1023 254  63 [         1 -     409639] <Unknown ID>\n 2: AF 1023 254  63 - 1023 254  63 [    409640 -  320702320] HFS+\n 3: AB 1023 254  63 - 1023 254  63 [ 322381824 -  110616584] HFS+\n 4: 07 1023 254  63 - 1023 254  63 [ 433000448 -   55396352] HPFS/QNX/AUX\n\nWhat I have done here is used the sector numbers from your output of the gpt command to show you what your MBR partition table should look like.  If you look closely, I have omitted the recovery partition from the table (since it's generally useless and you'd likely want to access your Additional Storage partition while running Windows).\nTo make these changes, use fdisk -e /dev/disk0 to enter fdisk in interactive mode.  You can issue a ? command to get a list of the available commands you'll need to do the modifications.\nAlso, when fdisk asks you if you want to edit in CHS mode, say no.  Don't worry about the cyl/hd/sec values.  They won't have the same numbers for you as they do in my table above, but it doesn't matter.\n\nA few words of warning here:\nThis layout is horribly unsupported by both Apple and Windows. Having the GPT and MBR partition tables disagree with each other is an error as far as OS X is concerned, and there is a 650MB gap between partitions 2 and 3 as far as Windows is concerned.\n\n\n*\n\n*Do not EVER under ANY circumstances use any partitioning tools to adjust/repartition your disk from this point on.  Best case scenario: it'd just give you an error.  Worst case scenario: it'd destroy the entire disk.\n\n*Make sure you do not use Disk Utility to \"repair\" your disk. Always make sure you have a partition selected when doing First Aid, not the disk itself.\n\n*Do not use whole-disk encryption software (BitLocker or FileVault). These require additional support partitions and will attempt to repartition the drive.\n\n*Do not convert your disks to Dynamic (Windows) or CoreStorage (Mac) volumes.  These will modify the partition tables also.\n\n\nA: You can use following guide http://www.rodsbooks.com/gdisk/hybrid.html\nand choose only the entries 2 and 5 from the GPT table to build the hybrid MBR.\n", "Q: IOS App that allows you to takes photos every X seconds and saving it in the camera toll (no time lapse) community\nIs there an IOS app that allows you to capture photos every X seconds and automatically saves it in the camera roll (not like a time lapse that puts it in a single video)\nThanks a lot! :)\n\nA: This app does the trick.

So, if you think the question's place is somewhere else - please tell me.\n\nI have noticed strange behaviour in my home network recently, the internet connection disappeared for few second (up-to few minutes) and then returned like nothing happens.  \nWhen checking the packets in the network (with Wireshark), I'v noticed that the problem is that the packets never arrived to the router - so I pinged the router, and indeed, he didn't respond (req timeout).\nFirst, do anybody have a theory why would the router stop receiving packets and answers connections for short periods of times (It's a brand-new TP-Link Archer C9)? I checked the light-indicators on the router and everything seemed fine...\nSecond, the more Mac-oriented question, when this behaviour happens, the WiFi indicator still indicate (full strength) connection to the network, and with option-click on the WiFi indicator I see that he says that he is connected to the router, but the internet is unreachable. How does it make sense that the computer thinks he connected to the router while he doesn't receives packets or answer pings?\n\nA: I am experiencing the same problem.  The issue is the router.  There are a number of reasons why the router would do this....memory of the router is too small, too many connections for it to handle, to just poor quality components.\nThe way you can verify that it is the router is by\n\n\n*\n\n*Pinging the router (which you did and it failed)\n\n*Pinging another device on your network\n\n*Test connectivity from another device\n\n\nAs for as your WiFi indicator, having full bars has nothing to do whether it has network connectivity (getting an IP address and being able to browse).  The \"bars\" indicate signal strength and signal quality, which both relate to the physical radio connection, not the network connection.\nIf you are familiar with the OSI model, it is layer 1 and 2 that your \"bars\" are reporting back.  Layer 3 is where your connectivity comes into play.  Think of it like how your (wired) Ethernet adapter  determines whether you have 100MB or 1GB connectivity\n\nWhat's the solution?\nGet a good router; or better yet, build it yourself.  I am finding that the consumer grade stuff is getting worse and worse every year so I decided to make a change.  \nI recently built a pfSense router on some old Dell hardware and installed an Intel PCIe AC Wireless card and with all my testing, I have yet to have the problem reoccur.  \nThere's even a good YouTube video on this:  pfSense: How to Turn an Old PC into an Epic Router\n", "Q: Is there a way to hide the text in the left hand column in Messages?

It was another coworker's old laptop, so it has tons of her stuff: software, private files (they only changed the username to give it to me LOL), etc... so I think it's time to factory-reset it! But it's my first Mac, I've been using Windows and Unix for 25 years and I've never faced this challenge. This computer has a lot of software licences which may be or may not be in a safe place outside the computer (for example, I asked our computer maintenance guy where's my Photoshop's and Office's license key and he has no clue... classic) so I'd like to cherry pick some Applications, backup them and then re-install the backup after the factory reset. I know it's possible to backup the full hard drive, but it's this cherry picked backup even possible for my computer? Do I need third-party software to accomplish it? If not, what are my options to backup this computer data? \nThank you very much for everything!\n\nA: There is no straight-forward answer to your question without a full list of applications you're looking to migrate. \nSome applications that don't use installers, can easily be simply copied to an external drive and back again, and will continue to work just fine. \nSome applications that don't have installers, may ask for the license keys when you restore them because it for some reason has detected a change. \nHowever, you mention things like Photoshop and Office. Without a doubt there is no practical way of copying these to an external drive, \"factory resetting\" the laptop and put them back. These applications use complex installation processes that involve much more than just placing a .app in /Applications.\nThere might be ways to clean up the Mac though. Removing all other applications, removing configuration files you don't need with one of the many \"app cleaners\" on the App Store, removing unused user accounts, etc. \n", "Q: How to add shortcut to directories to OS X menubar I have several directories that I want to quickly access in Terminal. And sometimes even in the finder. I would like to be able to hit an icon in the menu bar and have it drop-down a list of folders and files. When I release the mouse I would like the path to be typed out in terminal or a text editor if that's what I am using. If I am in the Finder, I would like the enclosing folder to open. \nIs there an app for that? I tried writing an AppleScript but am not having luck.\n\nA: found it.\nXMenu\nhttp://www.devontechnologies.com/products/freeware/\nTo expand on the functionality I needed:\nQuickly access a directory while in terminal\nSolution:\ncreate a text file or a clipping with the path of the desired location\nplace that text file or clipping or an alias of either in the specific location\n/Users/username/Library/Application Support/XMenu/Snippets\nNow an entry with the title of that text file appears under an icon in your menubar. Selecting that entry pastes the CONTENT of that textile or clipping wherever your insertion point happens to be. This works in any text editor or shell. \nSo if I have a text file named C++ projects and it has a one liner in it like:\ncd ~/Documents/Projects/Programming/Fun/HomeAuto/C++\nI just select that entry from under the 'snippets' icon that XMenu puts in the menubar, and BAM it's typed for me. I know that another utility, TextExpander has that option but they recently updated their app to be a subscription model. REALLY?! \nAs a bonus, XMenu can put another little gear icon in the menubar with similar functionality- ANY FILE under that icon is just opened.\nIn addition, XMenu has options for other quick access directory drop downs as separate menubar items - for example the applications list, home directory, developer specific applications and the documents folder.\nOh, and XMenu is free.\n", "Q: If AirPort Time Capsule is compromised, will it disclose contents of encrypted backups? I'm thinking about using an AirPort Time Capsule for my Time Machine backup. I would certainly use encryption, but I'm still concerned about sensitive backup data sitting on a networked routing device that could get compromised.\nThe Apple website has this to say on backup security:\n\nDon’t back up sensitive data to a network disk if you don’t trust the network administrators who control the disk. Instead, select a backup disk that’s under your own control, such as an external disk connected to your Mac.\n\nThis is a bit vague and it might simply refer to Time Capsules with multiple user accounts, so I'd like to know specifically: If there's some vulnerability in the AirPort Time Capsule and an attacker manages to compromise it and take over the Time Capsule by running arbitrary code on it, are my encryption key and the backup contents safe from them? I think this question breaks down into 2 parts:\n\n\n*\n\n*Does OS X encrypt everything locally and only send encrypted data to the Time Capsule?\n\n*If an an attacker controlling my Time Capsule tries to trick OS X into doing an unencrypted backup, will OS X warn me first?\n\n\nA: There are two ways of having backups encrypted. \nFirst, Time Capsule allows for you to encrypt the disk. If you enable this, the disk can only be mounted by the device if you provide it with the password to do so. This encryption is local and thus doesn't address your concern. It does mean that if the disk somehow gets taken out of the TC, it can't be read. \nSecond, data stored on the Time Capsule as an encrypted volume. This is a setting in your computer and can be set on your Time Machine backups but also for any other volumes you store on the network drives (or anywhere else for that matter). This data can only be decrypted with the password. This data gets encrypted and decrypted on your computer, and although others might be able to see your backup volume, they won't be able to read it. \n", "Q: Ability to automatically dim secondary monitor when focus on primary Is there a 3rd party app or combination of system settings and scripts that dims a secondary monitor until focus is brought to a window displayed on it? I like having multiple monitors but I would work better if there were a strong contrast between the two, where the contrast would invert based on which monitor had focus. (I can and do manually adjust the brightness when I know I won't need anything on the secondary monitor for awhile).\nRunning El Capitan with primary of a Thunderbolt display and secondary of a Macbook Pro.\nI have looked at questions such as\nShow a screensaver on a secondary display and\nAdjust brightness of secondary display and have a sense that some of the tools might, with a additional scripting, get me close to what I'm looking for, but I am hoping someone has already solved this specific issue.\n\nA: I started using the free app HazeOver which dims all windows other than the one with focus. The new beta version has a preference to dim all windows on a secondary monitor, and it gives me exactly the functionality I need. You can also opt to not dim windows that belong to the app in focus.

Is there any way in the mail app to prevent a certain address's e-mails to be marked as junk?\n\nA: First, make sure this person is in your Contacts, including the email address you want to mark as not being spam.  This is important because Mail checks there when determining what's spam.\nThen, go to the Mail → Preferences, ‘Junk Mail’ tab, and make sure the following options are checked:\n\n\n*\n\n*Enable Junk Mail Filtering\n\n*Choose ‘Mark as junk mail, but leave it in my Inbox’\n\n*The Following Types of Messages are exempt from Junk Mail Filtering:\n\n\n*\n\n*Sender of message is in my Contacts\n\n*Sender of message is in my Previous Recipients\n\n*Message is addressed using my full name\n\n*Also select Trust junk mail headers in messages\n\n\n\nAfter you do all this, Mail might still put some email in Spam/Junk.

How can I achieve this? Is there some code I need to add to it so it can appear in the menu bar?\n\nA: For a single script, it is no possible to create a unique icon that's sits near the clock such as the wifi icon for example. There may be unique AppleScript plugins that enable this, but I'm not aware of any. \nIf you need one icon from which you can run a bunch of different scripts, there are tools like FastScripts that enable this. OS X also enables application-specific scripts to show up in a special icon on the menu bar that only shows for that app. Not sure that still works in El Capitan, as I haven't used this functionality for a while. \nI run a tool called Keyboard Maestro which lets me trigger scripts in a variety of different ways, one of them being the menu bar icon. \n", "Q: delete ibooks and podcast app from ipad air2 I am trying to free up space and want to delete the podcast and ibooks apps.

426F6F74-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC\n326582272       1712         #gap 2\n326583984  650189000      4  GPT part - EBD0A0A2-B9E5-4433-87C0-68B6B72699C7\n976772984        151         #gap 3        \n976773135         32         Sec GPT table\n976773167          1         Sec GPT header\n\nThe gaps between partition 3 and 4 (gap 2) and between partition 4 and the second GPT table (gap 3) have variable sizes. I have found a size of ~1000-2000 blocks for gap 2 and 100 ± 50 block for gap 3. Some Boot Camp installations may also contain a second EFI partition after partition 3 (the Recovery HD).\nTo recover your Windows partition you have to delete partition 4 and restore the old NTFS Windows partition. To find the start block and the size of this partition you may use a partition recovery tool like TestDisk or find the partition manually.\n\nTo find your NTFS partition manually you have to install OS X to an external disk or thumb drive. Boot to the external drive, install wxHexEditor and enable the root user. Log-in as root user.\nThe assumption behind the approach outlined below is that the El Capitan installer either claims that a former second EFI partition (disk0s4 - 204800 blocks) is the \"new\" Windows 7 NTFS partition and has skipped disk0s5 (the real old Windows NTFS) or has created a random partition. \nA standard NTFS partition has two characteristic and almost identical blocks - the first block of a volume and the second last block - containing the string NTFS and BOOTMGR messages. If the two blocks can be identified the start block and the size can be determined. Adding this NTFS volume in the \"free\" space of disk0 should restore your previous Windows 7 volume.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Terminal and enter (below I assume that the disk identifier of your internal disk is disk0):\ndiskutil list\ngpt -r show /dev/disk0\nfdisk /dev/disk0\n\nto get an overview. Save the listings to a text file.\n\n*Remove the 4th partition:\ndiskutil umountDisk /dev/disk0\ngpt remove -i 4 /dev/disk0\ndiskutil mountDisk /dev/disk0\n\nYour partition table should look like this afterwards:\n...\n325312736    1269536      3  GPT part - 426F6F74-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC\n326582272  650190863     \n976773135         32         Sec GPT table\n976773167          1         Sec GPT header\n\n\n*Open wxHexEditor and in the menubar Devices -> Open disk device -> disk0 -> disk0. Expand the horizontal offset bar to show offset 00-1F like in the screenshot below (highlighted in red). The Go-to button is highlighted in pink and the search button in green. \nIf you have to enter values or letters never use copy and paste! You may alter the disk content doing so.\n\n\n*Quit wxHexEditor by choosing Quit and keep Windows.\n\n*Reopen wxHexEditor and open disk0 again like previously.\n\n*Hit the Go-to button and enter 326582272 (sector|Decimal|From beginning) like in the screenshot below to jump to the first block of the empty space.\n\n\n*Hit the Search button and enter NTFS (Text|Match Case) like in the screenshot below:\n\n\n*This should show you the beginning of your old NTFS partition like in the screenshot below:\n\nMake a note of the offset (highlighted in red  with the value 135266304 in my example; you will find a different value of course). Check the block if it also contains BOOTMGR messages like in my example. Since the NTFS volume was formatted with a German Windows 7 they are in German not in English.\n\n*Hit the Go-to button and enter 1 (sector|Decimal|From end)\n\n*Hit the Search button and enter NTFS (Text|Match Case|Search backwards). Make a note of the offset (in my example that's 650476781056).\n\n\n*The two offsets found should mark the boundaries of your old NTFS partition.\nTo get the start block divide the first offset by 512:\nWith my example offset1 that's 135266304/512 = 264192 (startblock)\nTo get the size use (offset2 + 512)/512 - startblock = size\nWith my example offset2 thats's (650476781056 + 512)/512 - 264192 = 1270198272\nBoth values found (startblock / size) should be divisible through 8!\n\n*Quit wxHexEditor and add the partition in Terminal with:\ndiskutil umountDisk /dev/disk0\ngpt add -b startblock -i 4 -s size -t EBD0A0A2-B9E5-4433-87C0-68B6B72699C7 /dev/disk0\n\n\n*Check with fdisk if the partition was added/modified properly in the MBR:\nfdisk /dev/disk0\n\n\nInspecting your current partition map it's unclear whether the disk0s4 partition with the size of 100 MiB is an old second EFI partition or was randomly built by the El Capitan installer. Restoring the old Windows 7 partition should allow you to access your data. It doesn't necessarily mean that it is bootable nor that the second EFI deleted in step 2 is not needed (to boot the restored Windows 7 partition).\nThis might fail due to other (random) occurrences of the string NTFS. Please contact me if you are unsure or run into problems.\n\nA: Based on your hexdump, I have determined a NTFS partition existed immediately after the last partition shown in your GUID Partition Table (GPT). The hexdump also shows the size of this deleted partition.\n\nThe values printed by hexdump are described in the table show in the section titled Partition Boot Sector from the Wikipedia site NTFS.\n\nUsing this information, you may be able to recover your lost partition. Below, I have outlined the procedure. Before executing the procedure, you will need to do the following.\n\n\n*\n\n*Download and install the Terminal application command gdisk. This\ncommand can be downloaded from the site GPT fdisk. If you wish,\nyou can read a tutorial found here.\n\n*Disable System Integrity Protection (SIP). See \"How do I disable\nSystem Integrity Protection (SIP) AKA “rootless” on OS X 10.11, El\nCapitan?\" for instructions. When finished, you can enable SIP.\n\n\nThe example below shows the procedure to fix your computer. I simulated your Macs conditions using a spare disk image. Therefore, you will need to substitute /dev/disk0 where I used /dev/disk1. If you make a mistake, you should be able to enter a controlC to exit the program. Any actual changes are not written back to your internal disk until the end of the procedure.\nSteelhead:~ davidanderson$ sudo gdisk /dev/disk1\nPassword:\nGPT fdisk (gdisk) version 1.0.1\n\nWarning: Devices opened with shared lock will not have their\npartition table automatically reloaded!\nPartition table scan:\n  MBR: hybrid\n  BSD: not present\n  APM: not present\n  GPT: present\n\nFound valid GPT with hybrid MBR; using GPT.\n\nCommand (? for help): n\nPartition number (5-128, default 5): 5\nFirst sector (34-978515631, default = 326787072) or {+-}size{KMGTP}: 326787072\nLast sector (326787072-978515631, default = 978515631) or {+-}size{KMGTP}: +649984000\nCurrent type is 'Apple HFS/HFS+'\nHex code or GUID (L to show codes, Enter = AF00): 0700\nChanged type of partition to 'Microsoft basic data'\n\nCommand (? for help): r\n\nRecovery/transformation command (? for help): h\n\nWARNING!

I have a workplace setup for my Macbook Pro 15\" (2011) that is actually two workplaces. One is the Macbook itself, for sitting. The second, right next to it, is a standing desk with an external monitor, keyboard, and mouse.\nThis works great - I can work on the standing desk, and when my legs get tired, sit down for a while and continue seamlessly on the Macbook.\nThe only painful point in the transition is that I have to physically disconnect the external display (an Acer 23\" display connected through a MiniDP-to-HDMI cable) when sitting down, so the Macbook display becomes the main (and only) desktop again. \nGiven that I may do this several times a day, this is bound to wear out the connector over time, something I'd like to avoid. \nIs there a more sustainable (software-only?) way to disconnect / deactivate an external display?\nAll I can find on the Google is about the other way round (turning off the internal Macbook display).\n\nA: There are two solutions I can think of:\n\n\n*\n\n*SwitchResX\n\n*Power plug adapter with remote control\nSwitchResX has a number of features including \"disable display\" which should deactivate it until the software  turns it back on.  From their FAQ:\n\nSwitchResX includes a function to remove a display from the System's\n  list of managed display. This means the display in question, once\n  deactivated, will not be visible from the System or from any\n  application. Only SwitchResX will be able to activate the display\n  again.\n\nAnother simple solution is to use a power plug with a remote switch.  It's an easy, non-invasive solution that will get the job done without having to install software or have daemons running that could interfere with your display.  macOS will not detect the display if the power is cut (though it will if it's in \"standby\" or \"sleep\")\n\nBoth solutions cost about the same (less than $20USD).  SwtichResX has a 10 day free trial and the power adapter comes with a 30 day return.  The software has the benefit of being elegant; but the switch, though a bit crude, has the advantage of you knowing for sure you display is disabled because it's physically off.\n\nA: While not the best option for the op having to physically disable the display I think that is the best option. I was able to get a Geeni multiplug that I can enable each monitor individually through Google Home. \nI tried the SwitchResX suggested here and it was the worst experience. I have a 2017 Macbook Pro with 4 monitors connected plus the internal display and as soon as I disabled one of the monitors, SwitchResX turned off every display and no matter what I did they never re-enabled. In the end I unplugged the 4 monitors which enabled the internal display. Then I plugged them again which did nothing and as I was looking for solutions each monitor slowly started coming back 2-3 minutes apart from each other.\nNeedless to say I ended uninstalling SwitchResX and sticking to using the multiplug through voice.\nIf you need one just search amazon for WiFi outlet. I found mine at Marshalls but I haven't seen one there ever again.\n\nA: Lunar can turn off an external monitor easily using keyboard shortcuts or by clicking a button.\n\nThere are two types of power off for external monitors:\nHard power off using DDC | Control+Command+Option+6\nThis turns off the monitor completely, and is equivalent to pressing the physical power button of the monitor.\nIt works by sending a DPMS 5 message through the Display Data Channel (DDC) protocol\nCaveats\n\n*\n\n*works only if the monitor can be controlled through DDC (some monitors block DDC/CI commands)\n\n*can't also be used to power on the monitor (when a monitor is turned off or in standby, it does not accept commands from a connected device)\nSoft power off using BlackOut | Control+Command+6\nThis simulates a power off by turning down the brightness, contrast and gamma to 0, and activating mirroring to move all windows to the built-in display.\nIt can be toggled on and off using the same Control+Command+6 hotkey or by pressing the power button in the Lunar UI.\nHow it works:\n\n*\n\n*Uses DDC (if available) to set the native brightness and contrast of the monitor to 0\n\n*Sets the system Gamma tables of the monitor to a list of zeroes\n\n*Mirrors the MacBook display to the external monitor so that:\n\n*\n\n*The built-in display keeps its native resolution\n\n*Apps/windows don't get trapped on a non-visible display\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: I'm the developer of Lunar. Hard power off is a free feature and BlackOut is a paid feature with a free 14-day trial\n\nA: If the work is not GPU intensive you might try to manually switch from the Discrete graphic card to the Integrated (Intel HD Graphics).

Using Terminal on OS X 10.11.4, initializing Terminal opens a new window running bash (by default). As I understand it, inputting echo $SHELL should output the shell that said command is submitted to. So, why do I get this output after switching from bash to tcsh?\n[<dir>] <username>$ tsch\n[<dir>] <username>% echo $SHELL\n/bin/bash\n\n\nA: Under csh family shells, you'll got your running shell with this command:\n% echo $shell\n\nIf csh was run, directly or undirectly, from a Bourne family shell that had its SHELL variable exported, the latter being the common case, the SHELL variable would stay untouched so echo $SHELL will still show the its previous value which would be confusing. \nThis is what is happening to you, one of the parent processes of your tcsh session was bash. If bash is started with the SHELL variable unset, it sets it to the path to bash, despite what its documentation states. Note that launching a new Bourne shell family wouldn't have changed either the SHELL variable if set. SHELL is definitely not the way to identify what shell you are running, just to known which shell is your default shell when in a POSIX environment. \nA portable way to know what shell is currently running would be:\nps -o comm= -p $$\n\nHowever, the latter command assumes $$ is set to the current process PID, which unfortunately some exotic shells like fish break. An even more portable way that workarounds this issue is:\nenv sh -c 'basename $(ps -o comm= -p $(ps -o ppid= -p $$))'\n\n\nA: It depends on the shell you are running in.\nIf it is a POSIX confirming shell e.g. bash, ash,ash, sh, and some others e.g.  csh, tcsh then echo $0 will return the shell's name\ne.g. \n~ $ bash\nbash-3.2$ echo $0\nbash\n\nor \n~ $ ksh\n$ echo $0\nksh\n\nHowever not all shells are POSIX e.g. I used to use ipython shell profile and now fish\n\nA: Another way would be to check which TTY your terminal is attached to and check which shell is running on that tty. Then you could look at the PID (Process ID) and PPID (Parent Process ID) in case your shell has spawned another shell as a child process:\nMacBook:~$ w\n15:16  up 8 days, 16:11, 2 users, load averages: 1.26 1.22 1.24\nUSER     TTY      FROM              LOGIN@  IDLE WHAT\nmyuser   console  -                19Apr16 8days -\nmyuser   s000     -                15:15       - w\nMacBook:~$ ps -ef | grep s000\nUID   PID  PPID   C STIME   TTY           TIME CMD\n    0 23865   293   0  3:15PM ttys000    0:00.14 login -pf myuser /bin/bash\n  501 23866 23865   0  3:15PM ttys000    0:00.05 -bash\n    0 23992 23866   0  3:16PM ttys000    0:00.01 ps -ef\n  501 23993 23866   0  3:16PM ttys000    0:00.00 grep s000\nMacBook:~$ \n\nIn the example above, using the w command, I've found out that the user myuser is logged in to the console (ignore this one) and also to s000. \nI then ran ps -ef and just looking at the PID and PPID columns, I can see that login (PID 23865) has executed bash (PID 23866, PPID 23865), which then ran two processes: ps -ef (PID 23992, PPID 23866) and grep s000 (PID 23993 PPID 23866). \nIf, for some reason, I executed tcsh from bash, running the above commands would still allow me to see which shell is my current command executed by. \n\nA: When you start a terminal session in OS X the login utility is called.\nFrom the man page:\nThe login utility enters information into the environment (see environ(7)) specifying the user's home directory (HOME), command inter-\npreter (SHELL), search path (PATH), terminal type (TERM) and user name (both LOGNAME and USER).\n\nSome shells may provide a builtin login command which is similar or identical to this utility.  Consult the builtin(1) manual page.\n\nNote the options used when the utility is called then read the man page:\nps -ef | grep -w [l]ogin\n\nSome of this information was gleaned from your record in opendirectory.\ndscl . -read /Users/your_user_name RecordName UserShell NFSHomeDirectory\n\n", "Q: How to avoid password prompt in terminal? So sometimes my Mac loses its connection to the Internet. \nWhen I'm in front of it physically I can use the terminal and do the following to repair it:\nnetworksetup -setnetworkserviceenabled ethernet off\n\ntype my password then:\nnetworksetup -setnetworkserviceenabled ethernet on\n\nand type my password again.\nThe thing is the machine is hosting several servers and I need them to be running even when I'm not physically present. So I wanted to run a daily script that would do this when I'm not present and be sure the connection is reset at least once a day. But since I haven't figured out a way to include my password in the command line I can't do that.\nSo my question is: is it possible to do what I described?\n\nA: Ok, thank you Batman for suggesting to edit the sudoer file.

You can edit the sudoers file by running\nsudo visudo\n\nOne way to do this is to first add a line to your sudoers file which allows the listed commands to be run without a password. By adding the specific command to your sudoers file, you can allow the desired commands to be run without password. You can do this by entering the following 2 lines to your sudoers file (the file that opens when you run \"sudo visudo\"):\n\nuser ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/networksetup -setnetworkserviceenabled ethernet on\nuser ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/networksetup -setnetworkserviceenabled ethernet off\n\nwith \"user\" replaced by your user name.\nThen, as your user, to run something at a regular time, you can use crontab\n\ncrontab -e\n\nand append the lines:\n\n0 1 * * * sudo networksetup -setnetworkserviceenabled ethernet off && sudo networksetup -setnetworkserviceenabled ethernet on\n\nwhich will apply this restart at 1 AM every day.\nAnother solution:\nAdd the commands directly to root's crontab:\n\nsudo -s\ncrontab -e\n\nThen enter the line\n\n0 1 * * * networksetup -setnetworkserviceenabled ethernet off && networksetup -setnetworkserviceenabled ethernet on\n\nand save and exit.\nYou may want to put this in some sort of script that notifies you that the network has been successfully restarted (e.g. with an email or something) so that you're sure it worked.\nAlternatively, you can use a launchd script.\n", "Q: How can I unsubscribe from iOS pre-releases? I added the pre-release profile to my primary iPhone so that I could use Night Shift. I considered the stability risk a fair trade off, because f.lux significantly improves my life, and I wanted that benefit on my iPhone as well. iOS 9.3 is out now, and I'm currently on a stable version. I don't need any pre-release features anymore but, I still get prompted to update to new beta versions. To prevent this, I've removed the profile in Settings.app, but the update prompts continue to appear. How can I re-enter the \"stable releases only\" upgrade path?\n\nA: Usually, the procedure for doing this is to delete the profile in the Settings app, then restart the phone. If you didn't reboot then it's possible that it still thinks you have the profile.\nMake sure you have not accidentally allowed it to update to a beta version (for example 9.3.1) as it's possible that if you are currently running a beta version then you might still get the later betas.\n", "Q: Is there a Google Calendar Mac Desktop App?

I know in the Settings app, it says 30 fps.  But after importing the video files to a computer, QuickTime 7 and X both identify it as 29.98 [sic].  MediaInfo calls it as 29.97.  DaVinci Resolve calls it 30.00.  Which is correct, and is it drop-frame or non-drop?\n\nA: 30 frames per second is based on NTSC broadcasting standards that go all the way back to the invention of television.  All recording equipment conforms to this spec even though we don't use analog anymore.\nNTSC actually runs at 29.975 frames per second, so both your apps are technically correct.  We just say \"30fps\" because it's easier to say and write than 29.975.\n", "Q: How to hide files found in spotlight? \nI want to hide TOP HIT, FOLDERS and DEVELOPER catalogues.

I formatted my 16 GB USB drive on OS X El Capitan with FAT file system and it worked fine. However, same drive on Windows 7 PC shows only 200 MB of size. Where the heck other drive size gone? I reformatted it with EXFAT this time and no problem of size on El Capitan but again it shows only 200 MB size available on PC. Tried to format it again with Windows this time but no help. Where all of my USB size  gone? I had no issues formatting and using it properly on Yosemite or Mavericks. Any suggestions??\n\nA: By default, Macs format all drives with the GUID partition scheme (GPT).  A particular feature of GPT is the EFI system partition, which on a Mac defaults to 200 MB in size.  The EFI partition is also FAT32.\nWindows supports GPT just fine, but it does not support multiple partitions on a USB flash drive.  Windows will only see the first partition, which is the 200MB EFI partition. It is the only operating system that has this limitation.\nTo reformat this drive, you will need to select the Master Boot Record (MBR) partitioning scheme in Disk Utility in order for Windows to use it.  You must also ensure that you create only a single partition that spans the whole drive.\n", "Q: How do I break out of a stuck lock screen? On a MacBook Pro (the office's, I'm a noob), I started the upgrade process from Mavericks to El-Capitan from the app store.\nAfter a while, the screen locked as, I assume, is usual. But now I cannot log back in. I typed my user's password in and hit enter, nothing. I tried hitting the the little arrow button to the right of the password and nothing. It's not frozen as the mouse still works, no beachball, I can clear the password. I clicked on the Cancel and Switch User buttons which appear to activate, but then did nothing.\nThat was the case for quite a while, then I tried clicking the Switch User button again, and the desktop rotated like a cube and now gives me a light grey screen.\n\nA: Just Cmd + Ctrl + Power'd it.

I do not know how to check if Firmware Password which prevents changing the OS Startup Disk options is enabled on my Macbook Air 2013-mid with El Capitan 10.11.4. \nHow to check if Firmware Password is enabled from OS X and Mac Hardware?\n\nA: Apple uses their own boot loader, which only boots OS X, so I am not entirely sure what you mean by secure boot. \nHowever, I assume you are asking how you can tell if a Mac has been secured with a firmware password. To find out, simply try to boot the Mac into anything but the normal OS X boot process. Try using an external boot volume, recovery mode, single user mode, verbose mode, target disk mode, resetting the PRAM or any other alternative booting approach. They will all trigger the firmware password window. \nFailing to enter the correct password won't do anything. The machine just wont boot. Even if failed, it will probably still boot into your normal OS X install, but I havent tried that. \nPlease note: The term \"firmware password\" on Macs can also be referred to as \"Open Firmware\" or \"EFI passwords\". \n", "Q: How to run swift command while staying on breakpoint in XCode?

I am trying to do a clean install of El Capitan on my Mac mini but it seems that restarting while holding the Option key does not work. I guess it's a Bluetooth issue, and keyboard signals are too late. So, I wonder is there any way to make this happen?\n\nA: Apple's Bluetooth hardware controllers activate after all of the system's self-tests at boot complete and the EFI firmware loads successfully, which is indicated by the system playing the standard Mac startup sound. It is at this point that the system will accept boot variables, either stored in the PRAM or those being sent via keyboard inputs. These are then passed to the OS X kernel to invoke the desired startup sequence.\nIf any inputs are being sent via the Bluetooth keyboard before the controllers are active, then they will not be recognized by the system. However, if these inputs are performed after the controllers are activated, then they will be properly read. Therefore, for Bluetooth keyboards, be sure to press the desired key sequences after you hear the boot chimes and not before.\nThis does all assume the keyboard has previously been paired with your Mac. If this is not the case, boot into the existing OS and pair the keyboard first. \n", "Q: Can I copy a bootable El Capitan installer USB stick to a hard drive partition and install from there? I am salvaging a mid 2013 MacBook Air 11\" that was discarded with a broken screen backlight due to beverage spill and missing its SSD. (I have a very tiny budget right now so I'm only spending on more expensive items when my testing shows the machine might work well.)\nI got the Apple Store to test the hardware then tested the computer myself by taking about two days to install OS X from one USB 2.0 flash drive to another USB 2.0 flash drive using an external display.\nIt seemed to work quite well other than that it ran at about 1% the speed of a normal Mac for anything that required disk access. This made it hard to test in any depth as problems could easily be due to OS X internal timeouts.\nI have now purchased a USB 3.0 external hard drive and knowing how slow USB 2.0 flash drives are to install from and to, I'm hoping to use the fast external hard drive for both, but I'm not sure whether this is possible or how.\nThe external drive happened to come pre-formatted for Mac with two partitions, which to seems ideal.\nCan I just copy the contents of the El Capitan bootable installer USB to one of the partitions? I fear I may need to copy it as a drive/partition rather than as a file or folder, since it must be bootable. Does such a copy require special software?\nI need to ask the experts here without being able to experiment since I'm unable to justify the purchase price of a magsafe 2 power supply until I'm confident the machine will work well. I am able to borrow a power supply only occasionally from friends.\nI realize doing an Internet OS restore via Wi-Fi is another possibility but the Wi-Fi I have access to is both slow and behind a captive portal. So for this question I'm not pursuing that option thank you.\n\nA: No, you can't just copy the files from one to another drive and assume that the new drive will install El Capitan. There is a special command to create such an install drive, called createinstallmedia which runs in Terminal\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the OS X installer from the Mac App Store. Quit the installer if it opens automatically after downloading. The installer will be in your Applications folder.\n\n*Mount your USB flash drive or other volume. You could also use a secondary internal partition.\n\n*Open the Terminal app, which is in the Utilities folder of your Applications folder.\n\n*Use the createinstallmedia command in Terminal to create the bootable installer. \n\n\nIf you're creating from an existing El Capitan machine, please use the following command. \nsudo /Applications/Install\\ OS\\ X\\ El\\ Capitan.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/MyVolume --applicationpath /Applications/Install\\ OS\\ X\\ El\\ Capitan.app\n\nI haven't personally tried doing this with an external hard drive instead of a thumb drive. But I don't see any reason for it not to work. \nFor more details and how to configure the above command (it depends on the OS you're installing to the USB drive from), please refer to https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT201372\n", "Q: With OS X , is there a way to create a 640 x 640 image out of a 500 x 640 image?

As I can check system processes in activity monitor, it is around 76 process running in my mac. \nAs I assume if number of running system processes increases then it impacts on Mac speed.\nIf number of running system processes is high then Mac speed will poor , if it is nearest to average running process then Mac speed can be fair , if it minimum then speed will be excellent\nCan anyone recommend or help me to identify that least number of system process and average system process runs in Mac. \n\nA: Your assumption about inferring total system performance from the number of running processes is incorrect. There is no such direct correlation.\nThe underlying operating system easily scales to thousands of (idle) processes without any noticeable effect on system performance on a modern Mac. Therefore it makes no sense to spend effort on reducing the number of processes as such.\n", "Q: Mac keyboard shortcut for Alt+4 now resolving to ¢ I am not sure how to google for this problem.\nI recently upgrade OS:X and had a crash and I lost the ability to do my alt4 shortcut to move spaces.

I have turned OFF the \"Upload Burst Photos\" option in both Camera and iCloud settings, but they are still always uploaded to my Photo Stream.  I absolutely do not want such photos to upload automatically, I want to always have to manually upload anything that was originally captured in burst mode.\nWhy is my phone always uploading burst photos regardless of having the setting disabled?  How can I stop this?\n\nA: Well after an hour on the phone with Apple support, 2 phone restores and 1 iOS upgrade, we finally got to the bottom of this.  Turns out the feature (to disable uploading of burst photos to PhotoStream) DOES work as intended.  It's the wording of the feature description that is more than a little confusing.\nThe text below the feature states:\n\nOnly favorite Burst Photos will be uploaded to your Photo Stream\n\nThe trouble is, to me (and to the techs at Apple that I spoke to), that sounds like no part of a burst photo will be uploaded until you have chosen one of the photos in the burst, as a favorite.  This is not so.  What it actually means is that the entire burst will not be uploaded.  But if you have Photo Stream turned on, a single photo from the burst WILL be uploaded.  And unfortunately, it's not the first frame.  I'm actually not sure what criteria iOS uses to decide which photo to upload, but it seems to be the first photo that it thinks is \"the best\" somehow.\nSo, the bottom line is that Photo Stream is an all-or-nothing proposition.  Either every photo you take (including a single frame from any burst photos) will be uploaded, or nothing will be uploaded.  There is no way to selectively upload photos on a case-by-case basis, unless you either leave Photo Stream off and manually share photos you want in your stream every time, or turn Photo Stream off & on between each photo you don't want to upload... but then you lose and have to re-download all your photostream content each time.  Not a real great solution either way.\nI feel Apple should re-word the description of this feature to make it more clear what the expected behavior actually is, but I won't hold my breath on that.\n", "Q: How to specify between identical menu command names when making custom shortcuts. I commonly set custom keyboard shortcuts in System Prefs. \nI tried setting a shortcut (command-shift-a, mirroring command-shift-j to move to junk) for Mail app to move messages to archive, since the default shortcut is rather weird (command-control-a). \nBut the menubar command is \"Message / Archive\", so what I enter in \"System Preferences / Keyboard / Shortcuts / App Shortcuts\" becomes simply \"Archive\". Thus it's getting confused with \"Mailbox / Go to Favorite Mailbox / Archive\". \nIs there a way to specify which is which, to avoid the naming collision? \n\nA: I found the answer on MacStories and SuperUser. \nColliding menubar command names can be specified via their nesting tree, using ->. Thus the shortcut name in my original question becomes Message->Archive. \n", "Q: change download folder based on website from which I download Is it possible to change Downloads folder in Google Chrome (or any other browser) on the fly, based on the website from which I download?\nExample: I start downloading on facebook.com and it downloads the file in ~/Downloads/Facebook. If I start the download from stackoverflow.com than the file is downloaded into ~/Downloads/Stackoverflow.\nHow can I achieve this? I imagine it would be possible to write a Stay Open AppleScript application that starts at computer startup and than continuously check domain name of my current tab. Not sure how I would change downloads folder on the fly though...\n\nA: You could write a folder action script which would parse your downloaded files metadata and move them into folders based on kMDItemWhereFroms metadata attribute value.\nOr just use Downloads Router Chrome Extension with predefined location rules.\n\nA: I know two products that do near the same thing as you want:\n\n\n*\n\n*Hazel (14-Day Trial): You can write rules to do actions when events are occurred.\n\n*SafariStand (Open Source): If you use OS X older that 10.11 it can be used. Although you can install SafariStand only on Safari and it organized downloaded files according to the date of download. You can use the source and find out how to customize and rebuild it.\n\n", "Q: How to disable private browsing on iPad, iOS 9? We have an iPad that we use as our POS at work.  I want to disable the private browsing function to be able to make sure people are not browsing the web.  Is there a way to do this?\n\nA: To make sure people are not browsing the web, disable the web. That is, set up a proxy server that blocks access to external websites – Squid or Privoxy would work – and configure the iPad to use that proxy server for everything. Then block direct connections (without a proxy) in your firewall.\n\nA: You can easily block web browsing or limit it with pretty much any of the newer routers on the market today.  I prefer limiting becuase while you may want to block general surfing, you may still need to get access to whatever cloud services your POS or business might need access to.\nFor example, Linksys has a feature called \"Parental Controls\" that allows you to lock down particular devices or IPs.\n\nThat's just Linksys' version. Pretty much all new routers have this feature built in.  Generally speaking,  you would want to limit access to the web by blocking all sites and allowing only a few during the times you specify.\nThe best part is, if you already have a newer router, you don't have to spend any additional time or money coming up with a solution - you already own it.\n", "Q: Debugging charging problem with MacBook Pro I have a MacBook Pro (unibody late 2008 15\")\nA few weeks ago the charger was causing hassle and eventually the connector came loose.\nThe MacBook eventually lost power. \nThen, I asked my friend for a lend of his charger. I plugged it in, no light showed indicating the charger was plugged in. However, upon plugging the charger out, the battery light would blink indicating the laptop was totally drained of battery.\nThe odd time (when I press loads of keys and power button at the same time) the laptop would turn on and I could work on it, but no battery showed and once I plugged the charger out it would die.\nI figured it was something wrong with my friends charger.\nI ordered a magsafe connector online and connected it to my broken charger.\nI tried it out today and exactly the same thing is happening as did with my friends charger.\nNo charger indicator light, and battery indicator blinks for a few seconds when I plug it out.\nIt can't be a fault with the charger, since the same thing happens with my friends charger.\nI doubt it's a fault with my MacBook Pro, since I had no issues before until the charger broke.\nI tried an SMC reset, though it's hard to know if it worked properly since the battery is totally drained (as the battery light indicates), and I'm not sure if I did the right SMC reset for my specific macbook.\nAny suggestions?\n\nA: Apple makes 3 different chargers for their MacBooks that you need to be concerned about:\n\n\n*\n\n*45-Watt -- For MacBook Airs.\n\n*60-Watt -- For 13\" MacBook Pros.\n\n*85-Watt -- For 15\" and 17\" MacBook Pros.\n\n\nYou can use a higher-wattage charger than you MacBook requires, but not a lower-wattage one.  Yours was an 85-watt charger.  If your friend's charger was a 60-watt, that's why it wouldn't work.\nAlso, if your charger is broken, attaching a new MagSafe connector to it isn't going to make a difference.  Assuming your MacBook is OK, you will need a replacement 85-watt charger.\n\nYou may also need to reset your SMC.\nFor your model, according to this Apple document:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down the Mac.\n\n*Disconnect the MagSafe power adapter from the Mac.\n\n*Remove the battery.\n\n*Press and hold the power button for 5 seconds.\n\n*Reconnect the battery and MagSafe power adapter.\n\n*Press the power button to turn on the Mac.\n\n\nYou should note that your computer will not give you any feedback at all when you do this.  No lights or noises will come out of the computer to indicate it was successful.\n\nA: If you can at least start the Mac up and make the battery lights flash, it's lint.\nHere's how you clean lint from a port:\n\n\n*\n\n*Get a toothpick.\n\n*Stick it in the port.\n\n*Carefully rub the inside of the port.\n\n*Pull out the toothpick.\n\n*Repeat.\n\n", "Q: \"Logout user after (x) minutes of inactivity...\" not actually logging out users On my network when a user is auto-logged-out, this feature seems to just activate fast-user-switching,  Is that what it is supposed to do?\nI am talking about the setting, as seen below in El Capitain, from System Preferences, and you can also access this setting with profiles/mdm for example from the Profile Manager (formerly Workgroup Manager).  I have this disabled in both the local system and the profiles assigned to both the devices and user-groups.\nI've also seen the same proposed issue in Yosemite.  This is annoying because when users don't logout, the system seems to go back to the login screen without clearing the RAM, possibly also locking files that are in use, etc.; creating a truly slow, buggy machine.\n\n\nA: Activating fast-user-switching is indeed what it is meant to do. It does not log the user out, so to speak, but it does prevent account access without the user's password.\nWe must first understand that logging out involves quitting everything that a user has open, and locking only secures the account in its current state. This does introduce some form of overhead as logging out requires all applications to be quit.\nThere's also the slight issue of a user's unsaved files being lost if the entire account is logged out instead of locked.\n\nSide note, you can achieve the same login window through checking \"System Preferences > Security and Privacy > General > Require password (x) minutes after sleep or screen saver begins\".\nAlternatively (although not advisable), running \nexec /System/Library/CoreServices/loginwindow.app/Contents/MacOS/loginwindow\n\nwill bring up the same lock screen.\n", "Q: Text shortcuts reset to older settings in System Preferences I use the Text shortcuts replace function provided by Mac OS X's System Preferences' Keyboard panel quite often. It helps me type things faster in most applications, such as my phone number, my full address, etc.\nLately, I've noticed that the text fields that I have recently updated got deleted/replaced by older values (maybe it's synchronized with a Cloud backup?). It's not the first time it does that.\nThis is what I have in situation 1 (correct information):\n\nAnd after a few days when I'll use one of these shortcuts, I'll find that they have been replaced to previous info. Situation 2 presents old info as such:\n\nSo I have to go back to Keyboard preferences, and re-type my current information where needed each time.\nWhere is this old info coming from? Another Cloud-linked device? Since this happens on a computer connected to the internet, why won't the info update on all devices when I edit it?\n\nA: Yes, they cross-pollinate from other devices. Mine come from my phone.\nI'm really not certain why they don't correctly sync both ways. If I add one to the Mac it appears on the phone, but ones deleted from the Mac don't necessarily delete from the phone & may later re-appear on the Mac.\nI've found the best solution is to just make sure you've also deleted them from any other device.\nSettings > General > Keyboards > Text Replacement\n", "Q: Buying an iPhone 6s from a small unauthorised seller. When does the warranty with apple start? Buying an iPhone 6s from a small unauthorised seller. When does the warranty with apple start? Does it start from the date he purchased/received the phone from phone company as a replacement/purchase or does it start when I open the product (it is sealed and never opened) and register it?\nThanks!\n\nA: Since it was new in box and sealed, then the warranty starts as soon as you activate it.\nThe phone's serial number is tied to your Apple ID (which you'll need to activate it), and they'll know that it's a serial number that has never been used before.\nThe only issue you might run into is the country of origin.  Apple makes different models for different regions.  So if you live in the U.S., for example, and you bought it online, you might have difficulty with a warranty claim if it's a European model.  But other than that, you're good.\n", "Q: Administrator account apparently lost after forced reboot of OS X Yesterday I ran into one of those rare problems with OS X (10.11.4) where I thought I had to reboot my MacBook. The cursor wheel was constantly spinning and I was unable to quit any apps or even access Force Quit .... (This was triggered inside Firefox.) So a reboot seemed like an easy way out.\nUnfortunately the reboot seems to have corrupted the setup in a bad way. I normally have two user accounts on the MacBook, like A and B, where A is also the administrator account. \nAfter the reboot A now seems to have disappeared. It e.g. does not show up under System Preferences | Users, nor in /etc/passwd. It is also no longer available as a choice in Login Window .... The lost account's files still seem to remain under /Users/A/, but I can no longer access them because I no longer have administrator privileges. \nI this a know problem (perhaps even an indication of malware)? How can I restore account A and its administrator privileges without risking corruption of its (presumably) remaining original files in /Users/A/? (At least I do have recent Time Machine backups and can log in as B.)\n\nA: Turns out I was lucky. Booting into Single User Mode (for obtaining administrator privileges as described here) apparently caused some extra disk check. This presumably led to the restoration of some corrupted piece of (meta)data and in effect my account A, including its previous administrator privileges. \nLooks as if the system is back to normal now: much relief!\n", "Q: What happend to my MATLAB icon on OS X? For some reason the icon for MATLAB (R2015b) no longer shows the familiar orange matlab surface icon, but rather reverts to the generic black box with exec under OS X 10.9.5 (Mavericks). Any ideas how to get the correct icon back?\nThe generic icon shows with Command-Tab and in the Dock, but the correct icon is shown in Finder. \nWhen I first installed MATLAB the first run (or few?) used the correct icon, but has since switched to the generic icon.\nAny idea how to to get the nice MATLAB icon back?\n\nA: Go to info.plist, change LSUIElement value back to 0. This will fix the dock icon. This might introduce some other issues however (I don't use matlab too extensively), so if you experience any visual glitches it might be due to modifying the plist, not matlab itself.\nI don't have other machines to verify, but I believe the \"issue\" you describe is not specific to your machine but is true for all matlab installations on osx, due to Matlab's weird startup sequence. \nThe reason why the first launch displays the icon is that the first launch actually launches an activator program, not matlab itself.\nMoreover, even after tampering with the lsuielement to restore the dock icon, the alt-tab icon will still be the generic black-rectangle script icon (again due to the way matlab is packaged and launches)\n", "Q: Do iPhone apps have permission to make calls without user interaction? I was reading about a missed call scam just now where the user gets charged even if they don't call the number back. It occurred to me that a malicious iPhone app could make calls to premium numbers to scam users out of money - indeed, it appears this has happened in the past.\nAccording to Apple's own documentation:\n\nWhen a user taps a telephone link in a webpage, iOS displays an alert asking if the user really wants to dial the phone number and initiates dialing if the user accepts. When a user opens a URL with the tel scheme in a native app, iOS does not display an alert and initiates dialing without further prompting the user.\n\nIt seems to me that an apparently benign iPhone app could, say, wait until the phone was left on charge (and hence likely not being attended by the user) and then initiate a call to a premium rate number to net the developer a tidy bonus. There doesn't appear to be any permission in iOS I can change to prevent this behaviour, since this is opening the phone app with a URL rather than accessing any phone data.\nCan anyone confirm if my understanding is correct and, if so, why on earth Apple haven't closed such a gaping hole?\n\nA: I've experimentally checked the iOS behavior by trying to initiate a phone call from one of my apps.\nHere are the results:\n\n\n*\n\n*It is possible to programatically start a phone call without user confirmation. I've just written a single line of code that is executed right after the App has been loaded. Meaning that if your App is in the foreground it can start a call at anytime, even without needing user to tap anywhere. \n\n*I've sent a silent remote push notification to the App in order to wake it app if it is not running, and then execute the same code. No call was started; iOS does not allow an app to initiate a phone call if the app is running in the background.\n\n\nSo answering your questions, the only way to start a phone call without the user noticing it, is by somehow convincing the user to leave the malicious application running in the foreground, and then start the phone call, as iOS won't allow this operation if the app is backgrounded.\nCurrently iOS does not provide any mechanism to block starting phone calls from a particular app, but it can only happen if the app is in the foreground. \n\nA: I've made a test app to check this. App can open URL such as tel://123456789 only when it is in foreground and active. When I call this code even just after entering the background state, the API to open this URL did nothing. So to answer your question - apps won't be able to make a call without your knowledge.\nTo test this paste this in your AppDelegate:\n- (void)applicationDidEnterBackground:(UIApplication *)application {\n   [[UIApplication sharedApplication] openURL:[NSURL URLWithString:@\"tel://123456789\"]];\n}\n\n\nA: When trying to initiate a call on iOS >= 10.3, a popup will always be displayed to the user.

I have noticed a lot of Adobe processes are running in the background at start up on an OS X 10.11.4 (15E65) machine with Adobe Creative Cloud (CC) installed.\nTo get rid of this, I removed everything with \"*adobe*\" in the filename from the directories used by launchd, which are: ~/Library/LaunchAgents, /Library/LaunchAgents, /Library/LaunchDaemons, /System/Library/LaunchAgents, /System/Library/LaunchDaemons.\nIt's not a bad idea to browse these directories manually just to get aware of what is - or could be configured to be - launched automatically on your machine.\nHowever, using this approach I got rid of all Adobe processes but one with the process name Core Sync Helper. The process' UID is me, not root.\nUsing the OS X activity monitor to get more information about this process it tells us that its parent process is launchd. The process' path is: \n\"/Applications/Utilities/Adobe Creative Cloud/CoreSync/Core Sync.app/Contents/PlugIns/ACCFinderSync.appex/Contents/MacOS/ACCFinderSync\"\nHow does Adobe get this process to be launched automatically?\nAnd how to stop it from being launched automatically?\nUpdate:\nAccording to YoshiBotX's answer, I used launchctl list as well as the App launchControl to find the service that launches the Core Sync Helper. To do so, I search for a service with adobe, accf or core*sync in its name. Unfortunately, there is no such service with an obvious name. All services on the system are by com.apple.... or from a third-party App that hasn't any relation to Adobe.\nAlso, launchctl list lists the PID of each Label. But the PID of the running ACCFinderSync process is not listed there at all. However, as mentioned before, its parent process is still launchd so I wonder how this can be.\nUpdate 2:\nUsing launchctl I was able to gather more information about the service using its PID (omitted lines marked as ...):\nmacy:~ jens$ sudo launchctl procinfo 352\n...\ncom.adobe.accmac.ACCFinderSync = {\n...\ncom.adobe.accmac.ACCFinderSync.apple-extension-service\n...\ncom.adobe.accmac.explinder\n...\nACCFinderSync\n...\n\nBut these aren't service which I can remove using launchctl.\nUpdate 3:\nBased on chiggsy's answer I was able to find more traces of the service (omitted lines marked as ...):\n$ sudo launchctl print gui\n    com.apple.xpc.launchd.user.domain.501.100008.Aqua = {\n    ...\n        unmanaged processes = {\n    ...\n            com.apple.xpc.launchd.unmanaged.ACCFinderSync.352 = {\n                active count = 5\n                dynamic endpoints = {\n                    \"ACCFinderInnerExtensionHost2\" = {\n                        port = 0x59a8f\n                        active = 1\n                        managed = 0\n                        reset = 0\n                        hide = 0\n    ...\n        externally-hosted endpoints = {\n             0x59a8f    U   A   ACCFinderInnerExtensionHost2\n    ...\n\n$ sudo launchctl print user\n    com.apple.xpc.launchd.domain.user.501 = {\n    ...\n        endpoints = {\n    ...\n             0x59a8f    U   A   ACCFinderInnerExtensionHost2\n    ...\n\n$ sudo launchctl print system\n    com.apple.xpc.launchd.domain.system = {\n    ...\n        subdomains = {\n    ...\n            com.apple.xpc.launchd.domain.pid.ACCFinderSync.352\n    ...\n\nBut that still did not help me to disable it.\nUpdate 4:\nkirb nailed it!\n\nA: launchctl has changed for the better in 10.11.4\nType the command without arguments to get the help. You'll see new domains to search and new commands.\n\n*\n\n*Printing the system root\nlaunchctl print system\n\n\n\n*Printing details about a particular service within the root domain\nlaunchctl print system/<com.example.service>\n\nFor your processes: if it's not in the system domain it's probably in the domain of that particular user.\n\n*\n\n*Checking the domain of a particular user\nlaunchctl print user/<uid>/\nlaunchctl print user/<uid>/<com.example.useragent>\n\nHowever, since you'll be logged into the GUI, you might want to check the domain of the GUI, which is kept separate.\n\n*\n\n*Checking the domain of the GUI\nlaunchctl print gui/<uid>\nlaunchctl print gui/<uid>/<com.example.service>\n\n\n\n*GUI domains are for processes that apply to a user interface.\n\n\n*User domains are for processes that invoke daemons that only apply to a particular logged-in user.\n\n\n*System domains are for system daemon processes, and apply to all users within that system.\nTo learn more, read man launchctl or read Apple's article about Creating Launch Daemons and Agents\n\nA: Another guess would be to check in /Library/StartupItems.  \nBut launchctl does not require your service.plist to be located in one of those directories.\nIn fact, you do not even need to have a file (as seen in the launchctl submit).\nSo as long as you register it with launchctl load|submit, it will be kept running/starting.\nI think your best way is to disable the tool with launchctl directly or by using an Application like LaunchControl.\n\nA: You can disable this Finder Sync extension from the System Preferences → Extensions pane (grey puzzle piece icon) – just untick Finder under the app name in question.\nThen log out and back in (or restart if you have more than one user logged in to your Mac)\n\n\nIn OS X, the Finder Sync extension point lets you cleanly and safely modify the Finder’s user interface to express file synchronization status and control. Unlike most extension points, Finder Sync does not add features to a host app. Instead, it lets you modify the behavior of the Finder itself.\n\nExtensions are parts of an app that are able to integrate with certain core components of the OS. Finder Sync extensions in particular enable tighter integration with Finder by way of sync status badges, and allowing buttons to be added to the toolbar, sidebar, and right click menus.\nOS X keeps a database of all known apps on your computer, and this also includes any extensions (.appex bundles). When Finder launches, it queries this database for Finder Sync extensions and launches them. For security reasons, each extension lives in its own process.\n\nA: The problem is that over the last years Apple has introduced other ways to auto-start items than having plists in specific folders like it works with launch agents and daemons. xpc services, smloginitems are not located in these places but are registered in the launchctl database (can be seen by launchctl list) but this specific adobe plugin obviously gets loaded at start but is NOT listed by launchctl at all. you can see some info by using launchchtl print user/501 but not by launchctl list. so what exactly is ACCFinderSync and why does it not show up? the hole launch system is kind of splintered up atm and it is very complicated to observe all forms of startup items. the big question here is: what are application extensions (appex) and how can they get detected (and disabled) at command line level if not by launchctl. \n\nA: I did what the accepted solution described. It worked but after some time, the procedure is back (maybe because I installed another Adobe software? Who knows).\nAnyway, I've a bazuka ready just in case it's back. Just name a tex file with something like: Autokill-coresync.command and place the following code inside:\n#!/bin/bash\n\n\nPROCESS_NAME=\"Core Sync.app\" \nPROCESS_NAME_2=\"Core Sync.app\" \nPROCESS_NAME_3=\"Core Sync.app\" \nSECONDS_TILL_KILL_PROCESS_AGAIN=20\n\necho \"----------------------\"\necho\necho \"Each $SECONDS_TO_DELAY_OPEN_APP seconds, kill: $PROCESS_NAME, $PROCESS_NAME_2 and $PROCESS_NAME_3\" \necho\necho \"----------------------\"\necho \n\n\nosascript -e 'tell application \"Terminal\" to set visible of front window to false'\n\n\nwhile true\ndo\n    sleep SECONDS_TILL_KILL_PROCESS_AGAIN\n    pkill -x \"$PROCESS_NAME\"\n    pkill -x \"$PROCESS_NAME_2\"\n    pkill -x \"$PROCESS_NAME_3\"\ndone\n\n", "Q: iPad Air 2 used ~2GB of Mobile Data Overnight: what for? I just checked my email and have had a shock. Two emails received from O2, one at 6:39 am warning me that 80% of my allowance has been used, the other warning me at 6:45 am that I had run out of data allowance completely. I had almost my full 2GB allowance left, since it just renewed on Tuesday, and so that means something downloaded ~2GB of data on the 3G/4G connection!\nI can't figure out why. 6:39 am was around the time I left the house this morning, so it would have been using 3G/4G, but the iPad was in my backpack and I was therefore not using it; so why/what was it downloading? When looking at the mobile data usage (I reset the statistics on Tuesday) I can see that 2GB has been used this period, but there is no breakdown about which apps have used the data.\nOne other thing to note is that I had set Sleep Cycle to wake me up, but when I did wake up the alarm was no longer set and unlocking took me to the home screen. As if the iPad had rebooted overnight.\nI want to find out what's happened here, but I am unsure how to find out any more. If iOS' Mobile Data statistics won't tell me which app did this how can I find out?\n\nA: 2Gb is in the range of a full software update (or a full backup), and it's unlikely the iPad did that over cellular.\nDid you have anything tethered to the iPad? A laptop perhaps? The data limiting doesn't kick in over tethering, and the tethered device thinks it's on wifi. \nIf that is the case, you may want to turn off auto-update.\n", "Q: Turn off USB power on OS X/Mac Mini I have a need to turn USB power off (and on) using a script or a piece of software. Ideally it should be possible to turn each port off/on separately, but also turning power off/on from all ports at once is sufficient. The machine I am using is Mac Mini. Anyone has a solution for this?\nBy USB power I mean Vbus, the 5V/500mA connection. I understand that the data connection is also turned down and it is fine, but it is not enough for me that the data connection is down and Vbus remains powered. This need comes from the need to keep mobile phones constantly connected for automatic testing. Some device/battery combinations do not like to be constantly connected and batteries start swelling in less than a year.\nI recognize that multiple variations of this question are around. So far no solution that I could use. I'll list here my findings so far:\n\n\n*\n\n*it is possible to accomplish this by using external self powered USB HUB and controlling it's power. However, this is not an option for me (even quality hubs have caused other problems in my use).\n\n*it is possible to disable USB by removing .kext files. Among other sources it is explained in OS X Security configuration document. However this requires reboot and I am not sure if it really disables USB power or just data.\n\n*there are many claims that it just is not possible. However, OS X itself does it when it detects a device that consumes too much power, so there is at least hardware support. This error message is copied from /System/Library/Extension/IOUSBFamily.kext/Contents/Resources/English.lproj/Localizable.strings: \"Unplug the device using too much power to re-enable USB devices.\" (of course I don't know if the disabling is done by turning off USB power, but I would assume it is natural action for the device that consumes too much of it). \n\n*it seems that on macbook the USB ports are normally powered even when the laptop is sleeping. While this is not solving my issue, it is kind of related.\nThe reason why I need this is that I have a test system where multiple devices are plugged in to a mac mini. The devices also charge over USB. It has turned out that if the device is connected all the time to a charger, it's battery is swollen in about a year, which makes the device unusable, insecure and potentially dangerous. Turning the power off when not needed, would significantly extend devices life.\n\nA: I spent a lot of time researching this problem some years ago - my conclusion is that it is simply not possible with the information available to us. The control of the power happens at a much lower level than the macOS kernel itself, so it is not just a question of configuring macOS or poking at the right kernel data structure. You have to modify firmware which is not possible for ordinary users.\nThe only working solution I found is to use a hub. This worked very well for me. If you have a hub that supports ganged power switching, you can easily turn off/on the power for each gang (set of ports). Similarly if you have a hub that supports per-port power switching, you can turn off/on each port on the hub individually.\nYou can download software for macOS to control the hub from here:\nhttps://github.com/mvp/uhubctl\nNote that this utility only supports controlling hubs that allow per-port power switching. The web site has a list of supported USB hubs.\nOnce I went with the hub solution, the hardest part really was finding a USB hub that supports ganged or per-port power switching. The actual software part is very easy.\n", "Q: get name of file from file path using AppleScript I am trying to get the name of file using AppleScript with the following code:\ntell application \"Finder\"\n    set filename to name of \"/Users/mainuser/Desktop/Test/shot.png\" // should return  shot.png\n    display dialog filename\nend tell\n\nI am getting an error saying:\nerror \"Can’t get name of \\\"/Users/mainuser/Desktop/Test/shot.png\\\".\" number -1728 from name of \"/Users/mainuser/Desktop/Test/shot.png\"\n\nWhat I am doing wrong?\n\nA: Using the file pathname from your question, here is the AppleScript code that should work.\ntell application \"Finder\"\n    set fileName to name of (POSIX file \"/Users/mainuser/Desktop/Test/shot.png\" as alias)\n    display dialog fileName\nend tell\n\nA more direct way of the above scenario is:\nSyntax:\nset fileName to name of (info for \"/path/to/file\")\ndisplay dialog fileName\n\nExample (using the pathname in your question):\nset fileName to name of (info for \"/Users/mainuser/Desktop/Test/shot.png\")\ndisplay dialog fileName\n\nThe shortest way to display the name of a file from its pathname in a dialog box is:\nSyntax:\ndisplay dialog name of (info for \"/path/to/file\")\n\nExample (using the pathname in your question):\ndisplay dialog name of (info for \"/Users/mainuser/Desktop/Test/shot.png\")\n\n", "Q: Changing the horizontal scroll speed on a corded Apple mouse I have the latest MacBook Pro running the latest version of OS X and I am using the corded mouse. \nThe horizontal scroll speed using the mouse wheel is dead slow. The vertical scroll speed is OK for scrolling regular websites, etc., but when I try to scroll something like a Trello board, the horizontal scroll speed is unbearable and I have to tilt the mouse wheel multiple times to get from one card to the other.\nIs there a way to increase the horizontal scroll speed, or am I stuck with a single speed for both axes?\nHacking system files or config files is OK with me if that's what it takes!\n\nA: You mention that you have the latest MacBook Pro and a mouse with a 'wheel'? Is it an Apple corded mouse? There are two current models available - Magic and Corded with a 'tracking ball', so my immediate thought is you haven't got a Mac branded mouse (dont think Apple have ever made a wheel mouse) and there in lies your issue. If its the latest tracking ball corded mouse then you should be able to set tracking speed in the preferences. Note: the System Preferences / Mouse panel on Mac 'changes' dependent on which mouse it detects to reflect the capabilities of that particular mouse... if it isn't detecting horizontal scroll capability you wont see this in the preferences panel and it may be running on a default preset coming from the mouse itself. \nHere is a screen grab of mine (running a magic mouse) - the tracking preference is universal vertical / horizontal so only one is shown. \n\nApple have built the scroll speed control into OSX so its odd that your mouse is reacting this way. I would be thinking broken mouse*, 3rd party mouse driver issue. The way to check that is to 'borrow' a colleagues working Mac mouse (see if it behaves differently on your Mac) or get on eBay and buy a used one for $20. Could be with you in 2 days.\n\n\n*\n\n*Apple mice can part fail. I have two currently with issues - one over sensitive and clicks when I don't want it, one with intermittent random scroll speed issues (which might be the laser failing). \n\n\nLink to help:\nApple Mice Variations over time on Wikipedia.\nTip: I work on Mac everyday to deadlines so part of my support kit is a bog standard Apple Pro Mouse (M5769) circa 2003 which I have used on multiple Macs to keep me working - its on my MacBookPro OS 10.8 right now for Photoshop as I prefer scrolling OFF in that programme. The Pro Mouse has no scroll function and I don't need a system hack, just plug it in. Two mice on the same Mac works fine and does not affect the Magic Mouse performance at all.\n\nA: My answer on Kilian Koeltzsch's very similar question will probably also work in your situation (I would have just left a comment, but I don't yet have that privilege on this network):\n\nYou can override the native ⇧+scroll function\n  with SteerMouse by using its ability to modify mouse scroll speed\n  and direction. You can even assign a scroll speed acceleration value\n  if you want to combine the slow and faster scroll speeds for enhanced\n  precision.\nHere's how to set it up:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*In the SteerMouse preference pane, select the \"Mouse\" tab.\n  \n*Switch the \"Horizontal scrolling\" option from \"Tilt\" to \"Roll\" (Fig. 1). This should be enough to let SteerMouse take over the\n  handling of horizontal scrolling, which is what is invoked when you\n  use the native ⇧+scroll function, so if you\n  don't wish to make further scroll speed adjustment, you can stop here.\n  \n*Select the \"Scroll\" tab (Fig. 2).\n  \n*Click the \"Roll Horizontally\" button.\n  \n*Make any further acceleration and sensitivity adjustments. You can also invert the horizontal scroll direction (Fig. 3).\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n", "Q: iMovie for OS X removed from OS X? I had already installed iMovie on my Mac. Now after some months I wanted to create a new movie, but I couldn't find iMovie in OS X again.\nWhen I look in the App Store I can see iMovie available now for $15.\nNow I am very confused. Could it really be that Apple uninstalled iMovie and now I have to pay for it? Or is this a different version?\n\nA: Apps don't disappear automatically. If you have iMovie '11 (version 9.x, gold + dark grey icon), the Mac AppStore will show the current version of iMovie (version 10.x, purple-coloured icon) as a new item because Apple charges for major version upgrades (e.g., version 9.x to 10.x), unless the user has a voucher from purchasing a new Mac.\n", "Q: FTDI USB device not removed after unplugging I have an FTDI USB adapter for loading software onto Arduino's, but it comes with a slight problem. 90% of the time when I unplug the USB cable, the device is not removed as a USB device. It remains listed under System Information > USB > USB 3.0 Bus. This does not seem like a problem at first, but the USB port is not usable anymore. So I use the other USB port on my MacBook. Same thing happens and so both USB ports are useless. After a reboot, I can start over.\nNot a big problem, but I really hate to reboot every hour or so. Is there a better way to \"remove\" / eject the device?\n\nA: I've found the Apple FTDI driver behaves more predictably than the one from FTDI.\nUse kextstat | grep FTDI to see which driver you have. On my MBP I had com.FTDI.driver.FTDIUSBSerialDriver (2.3) ... which exhibited the (unwanted) behavior described by the OP.\nI removed that driver with sudo kextunload -b com.FTDI.driver.FTDIUSBSerialDriver. \nNext time the FTDI dongle was installed, the apple FTDI driver was loaded automatically. kextstat|grep FTDI reports com.apple.driver.AppleUSBFTDI (5.0.0) ... Now I can remove and replace the dongle and it continues to be recognized by the Arduino IDE.\nHope this helps.\n\nA: I cannot guarantee that this will work, but I finally had some success today with an extremely similar problem with another USB device using an FTDI chip:\nThis may only work for El Capitan, as it has its own built in driver. All I had to do was uninstall the FTDI-provided driver, reboot, and simply let the built in driver work on its own, and the ports now stay available!\nIt may also help to apply the latest OS X 10.11.5 update.\nPLEASE NOTE: I have read elsewhere in my searches that if this doesn't work, then instead you may have to do the reverse, and uninstall the built in driver, possibly on each reboot, to ensure it doesn't conflict with the FTDI-provided driver.\nIf you can narrow down the solution to your exact situation, please post a better answer here to replace mine.\n\nA: There's a conflict between the native Apple driver and the one you installed from FTDI. You have to disable either one of them.\nFor e.g. Sparkfun wrote a how-to on that.\n", "Q: Does the Apple Mini DisplayPort to Dual-Link DVI adapter passthrough HDCP? I have a dual-link (2560x1440) DVI monitor connected to my computer (2015 retina MbP) through the Apple Mini DisplayPort to Dual-Link DVI adapter. It is reported as not HDCP-complient by iTunes and Netflix. Is this because the monitor doesn't support HDCP, or because the adapter doesn't pass the HDCP?\n\nA: Here's what Apple says about this: \n\nApple Mini DisplayPort adapters that offer digital connections—such as\n  the Apple Mini DisplayPort to Dual-Link DVI adapter and the Apple Mini\n  DisplayPort to DVI adapter—support HDCP content. Apple Mini\n  DisplayPort adapters that offer analog connections—such as the Apple\n  Mini DisplayPort to VGA adapter—do not support HDCP content.\n\nAlso, I found this answer on an Apple site but I can't verify if it's correct so YMMV:\n\nHere is what I found a) Mini DP to DP will offer full resolution 2560\n  X 1080 @ 60 Hz but HDCP content from iTunes is not permitted, ie. will\n  not run; b) HDMI adapter to DVI-D allows HDCP content to run but the\n  resolution is limited to 1920 x 1080 @ 60Hz; c) HDMI to HDMI also does\n  not offer full resolution but allows access to HDCP content; finally,\n  the only configuration that offers both full resolution and HDCP is\n  with Mini Display Port to Dual DVI-D cables.\n\n", "Q: How to convert a .mov file to mp4 file? How do I convert a .mov file to .mp4?\nThere are a lot of converter tools. But I fear there are a lot of virus infected ones. How would you convert a movie .mov file to .mp4?\n\nA: Use FFMPEG\nIt's open source, free and its libraries are what Handbrake (and others) use to encode MPEG file formats.  If you are going to have to use their software anyway, why not get it from the source?\nYou can download it from here:  http://ffmpeg.org/download.html\nOnce you have it installed, just issue the command in Terminal:\nffmpeg -i input.mov output.mp4\n\nWhere input.mov and output.mp4 are the actual file names and paths of the files you want to convert from and to respectively.\nI used to use Handbrake and VLC in the past to do this sort of thing, but ever since I discovered FFMPEG command line utility, I have no need for either apps any longer.\n\nA: '.mov' and '.mp4' just refer to 'container file formats'. What you have to take into account is the encoding format of the video and audio data contained in the file. Usually, you want an .mp4 file for sharing or playback on player devices. Such .mp4 files are usually expected to have the video track encoded in the H.264 compression format, and audio track in the AAC or the MP3 format. \nDepending on the original creator application settings, the video and audio in the .mov file may already be compressed with H.264/AAC codecs. In this case, you don't need to 'convert' (transcode) it, as this process would compress the video data again adding generation loss because of the lossy compression methods used by the H.264 and AAC codecs. Instead, you can rewrap the contents into an .mp4 container file without re-compressing the video/audio data itself. This is also faster than transcoding. \nSo, first check what video/audio codecs (compression formats) were used: Open the .mov file in QuickTime Player and press Cmd-i to bring up the Inspector window. \nIf the Inspector  shows H.264 and AAC, download the freeware tool MPEG Streamclip from http://www.squared5.com/svideo/mpeg-streamclip-mac.html (It's a long-standing, malware- and adware-free application. Just don't use any other download site.) Open the .mov file with MPEG Streamclip and choose File > Save as… (Cmd-Shift-S). In the Save dialog, choose 'MP4' from the drop-down menu.\n(If your OS X is configured not to open apps that are not downloaded from the AppStore, right-click the MPEG Streamclip application icon and choose 'Open' from the menu.)\nIf the Inspector shows that other codecs than H.264 and AAC were used, please post the detailed codec info here, so that a more precise answer can be given as to how to work with that.\n\nA: Thanks to @Allan's solution, but if you dislike the terminal you may try \"Miro Video Converter\".\nIt's based on FFMPEG but with a beautiful UI.\n", "Q: What file system should I choose when formatting a flash drive? I need to write a few large files (larger than 4 GB) on a flash drive, but I can't do it, because the file system of the flash drive is MS-DOS (FAT32). \nHow should I format the flash drive, so I can write down large files into it, and then open it on a PC on windows and download these files?\nWhat file system should I choose when formatting the flash drive?\n\nA: exFAT is the only format which will work for you as it will allow files greater than 4GB and work on Windows. Disk Utility can format using exFAT.\n\nA: What is the capacity of your flash drive ?\nMore than 8GB ? If yes then NTFS will do.\nIf you want to use your flash drive on Windows, only FAT32 or NTFS will be nice.\nIf you haven't download yet, there is a lot of software that allow OS X to write into NTFS partitions.

I might be using Waze or Google Maps, but it just looks like it's lost. It knows where it is, because it can follow my position on the map, but the application seems like it can't fully recognize its position and usually just says it's looking for GPS signal (well, sometimes it gets crazy too and goes back all the way to my starting point back and forth).\nDoes anyone know what may be causing this?\nThe only thing I suspect is sometimes I have a very low available space on my device, but I'm not totally sure and would sure like to find out how to fix this annoying behavior.\n\nA: It can’t hurt to open 1 GB of free space, but your GPS is more likely an issue with location services. \n\n\n*\n\n*Get a good backup\n\n*Disable location services entirely and power down the phone \n\n*Power on and enable location, verify cellular data and WiFi, bluetooth, data and cellular radios are on. \n\n*Try maps to locate and walk to be sure GPS is tracking \n\n*Take some photos\n\n\nIf you still are not getting gps in other apps, consider deleting the app (reminder about backup) and reinstalling.

If that doesn't work, try removing that particular email account, rebooting the phone and then re-adding it via\nSettings App > Mail, Contacts & Calendar\n\nA: The Apple Mail app likes to keep cache and data from your emails available offline. That is very helpful for viewing emails and their digital content when you dont have a strong signal, or have access to wifi.\nThere are some solutions that can help you out though:\nDelete the mail account off of the iPhone. Then restart the iPhone and then re-add that email back to the iPhone.\nUse the Gmail app for iPhone. The gmail app will keep the email size much lower than whats on your iPhone. The most I've seen the gmail app do for me is 400MB. Thats definitely a huge saving in contrast to 2.5GB.\nLimit the amount of email that Gmail can allow the Apple Mail app to have access to. You will have to use the desktop to access this setting in gmail. You can log onto gmail.com, open the Settings page, click “Forwarding and POP/IMAP,” and activate the “Limit IMAP folders to contain no more than this many messages” option. Set it to lets say “1000” and the Mail app won’t be able to download more than the 1000 emails from your account. If you use multiple folders, then that 1000 emails applies to each folder.\nThese three should give you some options to test out and free up some of your storage that the Mail app is eating up.\n", "Q: How to back up shsh blobs and APTicket in iOS 9.1 in order to be able to downgrade to it after update? Just got a new iPAD air 2, iOS 9.1. It says I should update it to iOS 9.3.1. \nI might be interested to jailbreak it later on, so I'd like to preserve that option for me possible.\nI hear jailbreak for 9.3.1 is not available yet, and on the other hand, apple stopped signing iOS 9.1 and it is impossible to install or downgrade to iOS 9.1. I want to know how I can back up the current state with iOS 9.1, and later after I updated the iOS, when ever I wanted I could restore to the iOS 9.1.\nI know that I should backup shsh blobs using Tiny Umbrella. but I cannot find the official download file in their website.\nAlso I don't know how to backup APTicket.\nThanks\n\nA: From your question, it seems you're mainly concerned with wanting to keep (or return to) iOS 9.1? If that's the case, then just don't update. \nIf, however, you're concerned with your data, such as contacts, text messages, photos, etc then updating to iOS 9.3.1 is not going to result in you losing any of this data. \nIf for some reason you've had to erase all data and start again with a newer version of iOS, then restoring data from a backup with an older iOS version works fine, so long as it is a backup from the same device.\nSo I guess what I'm saying is that as long as you have done a backup prior to updating iOS, then you will have no reason to ever go back to iOS 9.1. Even if you lost all your data, you'd be able to restore the data from your backup. \nAlso, I want to add there are a lot of reasons why you should update to the latest iOS version as Apple has recently resolved a number of serious (albeit rare) issues that could have bricked your device.\nHope this helps.

All of Windows and my personal files are not backed up (since the NAS is a work-owned system)\nFurther edit: I can no longer boot to Windows. I should mention that the value of th data on this drive is such that I am fully willing to pay a professional recovery company anything to recover it. How does that process work if I need to do it?\n\nA: Alright, I fixed it. I installed a Live image to my flash drive and copied the TestDisk software to it. My live image was Windows 10 To Go, but I believe any OS could handle it. \nThen, I ran a scan using TestDisk, and re-enabled the \"deleted\" partitions. After doing this, I wrote the new GPT to disk, and rebooted. Held the option key, and the partitions showed back up.\nI essentially followed this guide, but since my partitions weren't actually in the partition table, it showed them as 'deleted' - setting them back to 'primary' and writing it fixed it.\nMoral of the story - Don't mess with any partitions on a Mac from anything else than software in OS X or you may trash your partition table.\n", "Q: How do I install new Mac OS onto a new unformatted HD The HD crashed on my old MacBook (white Mid 2007) and appears to be unrecoverable.   Though I bought a new MacBook Pro, I would like to resurrect my old MacBook, by buying a new hard drive.  (It had an 80 GB drive, and those appear to be really inexpensive).  \n1)  Is there a way for me to get an OS onto my MacBook after I install the new HD?  (Can I do this myself?)  I think it had the Mac OS X Lion.\n2)  I think that Apple keeps a record of my devices, and their OS's. If I went to the Apple Genius Bar, would they replace my OS for free and install it for me?\n\nA: The MacBook 13\" Mid 2007 is obsolete!  Meaning that even with the latest version of Mac OS X it supports, 10.7.5, the OS is no longer supported in any respect, has un-patched security flaws that will never be fixed. From a security standpoint, you'd be better off running a current version of Linux Mint then Mac OS X Lion 10.7.5 on that MacBook.\nThat said, if you really want to run the latest Mac OS X that MacBook model supports, then you'll need to acquire a copy of the Install Mac OS X Lion.app application bundle and use DiskMaker X (formerly Lion DiskMaker) to create the USB Installer as it does not support the createinstallmedia command found in the application bundles of the OS X installers starting with OS X Mavericks and later.\nIf you previously purchased Mac OS X Lion, then I believe it should appear under Purchased in the App Store and can be downloaded again and if not then you'll have to ask a friend to see if it's in theirs. \nAnother possible option is to take the MacBook to an Apple Store and see if the Genius Bar can install a copy of Mac OS X Lion for you.\n\nA: You can install OS X using either a Snow Leopard installation disk (which should have been included with the computer–however you'll need 10.6.8 to go further, as earlier versions contain no online-only upgrade path)\nOr:\nWith a thumb drive that has been set up to install OS X. You can easily create these thumb drives using instructions in Create a bootable installer for OS X.

Therefore there isn't anything you can do directly, however here is a workaround of sorts.\nNote that this workaround requires changing the default application for file types, e.g. .mov, you'd normally open directly with QuickTime Player to the application created herein, called: QTP Fit to Screen.app\nUsing Automator create a new Application and add a Run Shell Script Action.\nChange: Pass input: [to stdin] to [as argument]\nAdd the following code:\nif [[ ! -z $1 ]]; then\n\n    open -a \"QuickTime Player\" \"$1\"\n\n    osascript -e 'tell application \"QuickTime Player\" to activate' \\\n              -e 'delay 1' \\\n              -e 'tell application \"System Events\" to keystroke \"3\" using command down' \\\n              -e 'tell application \"QuickTime Player\" to play front document'\nfi\n\n\nSave it as an Application named: QTP Fit to Screen\nIn order for QTP Fit to Screen to be the global default app for, e.g. .mov, files you'd open in QuickTime Player you'll have to use the Default Apps Preference Pane, RCDefaultApp by Rubicode to change which application opens a given Extension.\nInstall RCDefaultApp and then in System Preferences > Default Apps select the Extensions tab and scroll down to mov and then change the Default Application: to: QTP Fit to Screen\nNow then you double-click .mov files in Finder or accessing them from Spotlight the QTP Fit to Screen application will open the target file in Quick Time Player, set View to Fit to Screen and start playing the file.\nNote: If you do not want it to automatically start playing the file then remove the line of code, the one that has \"play front document\" in it.\nIf you need modify other default methods of file types, Apps, URLs, UTIs, etc. the Default Apps Preference Pane, RCDefaultApp by Rubicode, is a great utility for it.\nTo make the QTP Fit to Screen.app application bundle look better in the Applications folder you can copy and paste the QuickTime Player.app application icon from its Get Info sheet to the icon of the Get Info sheet for QTP Fit to Screen.app.\n\nNote: I added the if statement to the code so the QTP Fit to Screen application doesn't error out when executed by itself.  In other words, double-clicking it will essentially do nothing, whereas without it will throw a couple of error messages.\n", "Q: iPhone 4 App Store won't download apps I'm a user of an iPhone 4 with iOS 7.1.2.  \nWhen I want download an app, it tells me it need to update to iOS 8.4, but it's not supported for the iPhone 4!\nIs this only a requirement for specific apps or it is a bug?\n\nA: \nIf you open the App Store page for an app and scroll to the bottom, there's a section titled \"Compatibility\" that will tell you what the minimum version of iOS is that the app requires. \n(This is not a screenshot of the OP's problem app, but rather The Infinite Arcade, which was the first app I saw.)\n\nA: Apps which require features not available in older iOS versions can not be downloaded on these older versions.

The safest way to recover the drive's data is to pull it out of the machine and connect it to a different machine. However this is difficult and not likely an option for you. I would try getting someone you know to create a bootable flash drive of an operating system (which system doesn't really matter). You can use this drive to either 1) access all of your files or 2) reinstall a working OS.\n\nA: Your iMac cannot find a Bootable Volume\nI am assuming you have something similar to the image below.  This means that your iMac can't find anything to boot off of.  It can be for any number of reasons - a corrupt drive, a new drive, a missing drive, etc.  But basically, your iMac searched and found nothing to boot from. \n\nRecovering Your Data\nStop everything you are doing on that iMac!  The more you do to your drive at this point lessens the chances for data recovery.  Your very first priority is to try and recover the data you had on there.\nFor that you will need a good recovery program.  I have personally used DiskDrill with great success.  You can use it in Free Mode to scan your drive and see what is salvageable before you buy.\nIf you go this route, you are going to need an external USB drive (I personally swear by Western Digital)  If you don't have one, now is the time to purchase it because you are going to want to use it now for the recovery and later for your Time Machine backups.\nOnce you have recovered what you can, it's time to move on to the next step...\nRecovery Mode\nSince you said that your drive formatted and/or partitioned, you more than likely wiped your recovery partition.  All is not lost.  Depending on the age of your Mac, you have a couple of options\n\n\n*\n\n*You can do an Internet Recovery.  Hold down Command R while powering on your iMac.  Pretty much all Macs manufactured after mid 2011 support Internet Recovery.  The Macs that can be upgraded to support Internet Recovery are listed on Apple's website:  Computers that can be upgraded to use OS X Internet Recovery.\n\n*Have someone download the El Capitan Installer and create bootable USB. \n\n*If you have access to an Apple store, you can take your machine in and they will allow you to download El Capitan using their network for free.  \n\n*You may be able to find bootable media on eBay.  If you go this route make sure you buy from a seller with a good reputation and is US based.  \n\n*Never, never, never get your bootable image via a Torrent site.\nSet up Time Machine\nOnce you have everything recovered (what you can recover), I strongly advise you to set up Time Machine for backup and recovery.  It's not difficult - you just use the USB drive I mentioned earlier, set TM to back back up to it and, if applicable, tell TM what you don't want to back up.  \n\nA: Can't you boot from recovery partition and download again?\nhttp://osxdaily.com/2012/02/03/how-to-boot-into-os-x-lions-recovery-hd-partition/\n", "Q: Can AppleScript be used to brute force a FileVault drive where the password is lost?

This is absolutely what I needed. I did however encounter an issue completing these steps using encrypted APFS volumes, but I found a solution.\nI'm using encrypted APFS volumes with macOS Big Sur. I encountered an issue running diskutil cs list as it returns \"No CoreStorage logical volume groups found\" in Terminal, even when an encrypted APFS volume is mounted. As a result, I wasn't able to obtain the necessary UUID of the encrypted APFS volume I wanted to target.\nTo resolve this issue, I instead ran diskutil list in Terminal which returned the following:\n/dev/disk3 (synthesized):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      APFS Container Scheme -                      +5.0 TB     disk3\n                                 Physical Store disk2s2\n   1:                APFS Volume ⁨MY_DRIVE                3.9 TB     disk3s1\n\nOnce I located the correct identifier for MY_DRIVE (in this case: disk3s1), I substituted diskutil coreStorage unlockVolume 1BFD0C99-1A67-4DC2-A0F4-199B2AE635B0 -passphrase \"$line\" 2>/dev/null in user3439894's code with the following:\ndiskutil apfs unlockVolume disk3s1 -passphrase \"$line\" 2>/dev/null\n\nPlease note that the disk identifier may change over time as volumes are mounted, unmounted, etc. You may need to run diskutil list periodically to ensure you have the correct identifier for the volume you want to target.\nEverything else user3439894 provided was the same for me and worked perfectly.\n", "Q: Mid 2012 MBP shuts down claiming no power with charge at 30% or 40% or more I have two mid 2012 MBPs. Sometime last year they both started randomly shutting down and showing the 'please plug me in to power' image when trying to start them up. That would be fine if the batter was at 1% or less but this happens when the battery is at anywhere from 30% to as high as 48% full. The power cycle info says 500 cycles or so. Both of them do this. They are both patched current, always. I asked Apple they suggested NVRAM PRAM and SMC reset, as expected, which had no effect. Any ideas?\n\nA: You battery is dying!\n4 years is usually average when a battery starts dying.\nI would personally take it to the Apple store, have them look at it. They will tell you if it needs replacing. I would just get it replaced at the Apple store, the price difference is not to much and you know you're getting a good battery.\nReplace it ASAP, as there is a chance the battery will start to swell and damage other components in your computer.\nIf you can download Coconut Battery and give us a screen shot: \nYou can also:\n1. Click on Apple logo at top left\n2. Click on 'About this Mac'\n3. Click on System Report'\n4. Power on the left\nYou will then see a few lines related to battery information like this\nCycle Count: \nCondition:\n\n\nA: Your battery is shot.\nA battery's life is determined more by age than the number of cycles.  Yes, number of cycles do play a part, but the biggest culprit is age.  In short, you have a 4 year old battery.  A 4 year old battery that was never used is going to perform about as well as a 4 year old battery with 500 cycles.\nMATH FINDS TOP CULPRIT AS LITHIUM-ION BATTERIES AGE\nAs far as what you are seeing, this is not an abnormal symptom.  Your MacBook Pro has no sensor to be able to determine how quickly a charge will dissipate within the cell.  All it can do is measure the voltage under load and calculate how much charge is left.  \nAs your battery ages, there is a build up of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI).  This layer is what \"transfers\" the electrical charge from the chemical reaction.  As this layer builds, the performance degrades.  This layer continues to build from the time the battery is manufactured until the time it is recycled.  There's no stopping it.\nIn short,  your MBP is calculating that you have 30-40% of battery left; it's only a calculation as it cannot account for or measure the SEI layer buildup.\nJust to provide you a reference, I am working on a Dell Precision M4300 laptop (installing FreeBSD).  The battery reports 100% and healthy.  If I unplug, I get about 30 seconds before the battery dissipates and the laptop turns off.  So, I have the same symptoms you do, except it's happening at 100% charge.  This laptop and battery are 8 years old so the behavior is not unexpected.  What would be unexpected is if the battery held any charge at this point.\nThe Good News\nIt's pretty easy to fix.  iFixit.com has an excellent guide:  Battery and Trackpad. Disassembling MacBook Pro 15\" Retina 2012-2015 and the prices are relatively low (less than $45 on Amazon). \nDisclaimer:  I have personally used two of these exact model batteries on MBP's and both are still running strong.\n\nA: I had a consistent 20% shutdown.

I tried all the suggested solutions, yet nothing has helped. Inspecting the apps in more details, I noticed that they had \"eXtended ATTRibutes\" (xattr) which were named:\ncom.apple.finder.copy.source.inode#N\ncom.apple.finder.copy.source.volumeuuid#N\n\nThese attributes, among others, are set when files are copied within Finder. In case you ever wondered why apps getting copied are grayed out until the copy has finished and how the Finder can show copy progress within the Finder window itself (and not just within the copy dialog) - that's all done by different kind of attributes that are set on the file and telling the system that this file/folder/bundle is just being copied and how much of it already was copied.\nUsually Finder removes all these attributes after copy, but somehow these attributes got stuck in my case and with these attributes set, Spotlight refuses to show the apps, thinking they are still in the process of getting copied. \nI had to manually remove them to fix that problem:\nxattr -d com.apple.finder.copy.source.inode#N PATH\nxattr -d com.apple.finder.copy.source.volumeuuid#N PATH\n\nWith PATH being the full path to the application (just drag it from Finder into a Terminal window and the full path is written there). Depending on access permissions/ownership, you may have to prepend the commands with sudo to gain extended privileges.\nI thought it may be helpful to share that information with the world, that's why I'm posting it here.\n\nA: In a terminal, enter:\nsudo mdutil -E /\n\nI tried the Preferences --> Spotlight --> Privacy suggestion with the /Applications folder but that did not work for me.\nThen I tried sudo mdutil -E /Applications in a terminal, and that didn't work either. \nIt's possible that using the Preferences --> Spotlight --> Privacy suggestion with the entire disk would have worked also, but in any case, I find typing that single command (sudo mdutil -E /) on the command line easier.\nThis command starts the reindexing process and then quickly exits, so it may take a while after it has run for your application to be accessible via Spotlight. An easy way to see if it's still indexing is to start spotlight (command-space) and type at least 1 character.  If it's reindexing, it will say \"Indexing\" just below the text entry field.\n\nA: Quicker alternative to the accepted answer:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to System Preferences --> Spotlight --> Search Results\n\n*Untick Applications\n\n*Tick Applications\nYou may need to close and re-open preferences between (2) and (3). \n\nA: Go to System Preferences --> Spotlight --> Privacy. While that's open, go to Finder --> Applications and drag Matlab from Applications into Privacy. Close out System Preferences then reopen it and remove Matlab from the same place. \nThis will force a reindex for Spotlight. I've seen this work for some people and not for others but it's worth a shot.\n\nA: I've never tried it, but running mdimport -d1 /Applications/Matlab_R2015b.app in the Terminal might work as well. You can increase the number up to 4 for increasing debugging information, which might tell you why the indexing isn't working.

They asked me to use the option first aid in Disk Utility, this didn't help. They then asked me to reboot my iMac in recovery mode and do the same thing again. This also didn't help. \nAfter these two options to repair my partition, they asked me to back-up whole drive and reinstall OSX. They told me that this would definitely work because the hard drive was a fusion drive, part mechanic and part ssd.. Can't remember the exact details on why this would work thought... But i reinstalled my whole OSX and got my 1TB back. :). \n", "Q: Cannot reinstall OS X on a MacBook Pro (13-inch, Mid 2009) My hard drive crashed, so I purchased a new one on Amazon. I have installed it and located an OS X Disk to install from.\nI don't want to restore from any backups as this is just a computer with no saved files.\nI am in the startup and it asked me to choose a location to install OS X but there is nothing to choose.\nHow can I install OS X on this machine?\n\nA: You'll want to load the computer into what's known as Network Recovery (or Internet Recovery) by holding down the following buttons while turning the computer on: Command, Option, and R. You will need to know the password for your Wifi network. \nWhen you're loaded into the right menu, you'll look for Disk Utility. Once Disk Utility, look for the name of the disc on the left hand side. You should see the name of the hard drive (i.e. Apple HDD 512GB etc).\nSelect the Partition button if you're using the native 10.11 Disk Utility or the Partition tab in the middle if you're using the lower systems. \nIf you're using the newer system, it should by default auto-adjust the partition to the right size and format. If you're using the old one, follow these steps: \n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Partition type and change the drop down from \"Current\" to \"1 Partition.\" \n\n*Change the format to \"Mac OS X Extended Journaled.\"\n\n*Give the disk a name in the field on the right. Macintosh HD is the default name for Macs out of the box. \n\n*Click on \"Options\" and choose GUID Partition Table. Click Ok. \n\n*Click Apply, then Partition. \n\n\nOnce this partition is created, you sh[ould be able to install OS X on your new hard drive.]\nThis will allow the disk to be formatted into the proper format and should allow it to install on the new HDD. \n", "Q: Fine to keep macbook on power for unlimited time? I just got a used Macbook Pro (retina) 2012 running El Capitan. I am keeping it charged and on all the time. Is there any harmful effect from doing so on the battery in the long term?\n\nA: Technically no, there is no damage done to it. But it is still smart to let it unplug and fully drain the power to keep it in tip-top shape. \n\nA: There is no harm in leaving your battery plugged in - your MacBook Pro will directly use the power adapter for its power needs. However, Apple (used to) recommend unplugging the battery occasionally - \"An ideal use would be a commuter who uses her notebook on the train, then plugs it in at the office to charge. This keeps the battery juices flowing.\"\nThere are other ways to improve your battery life, such as keeping it out of extreme cold and heat, and always updating to the latest Mac OS.\n(Source, in case you want to verify this)\n", "Q: How to use GUI pinentry program for GPG I would always like to use the GUI version of entering my GPG passphrase.

It seems every time I go into iTunes it's duplicated my TV shows again. I could understand if these were shows that I'd ripped from DVDs myself (maybe I'd made a mistake or something), but in the case of CHEERS (see below), all the episodes are purely bought through iTunes.\nWhat's going on? :(\n\nIf you click on each of those Cheers you will see exactly the same episode listings across all three. Same goes for WINGS - identical listing. I can't fathom what's going wrong? :( Do I need to rebuild my iTunes database or something?\n\nA: So I rebuilt my entire iTunes library only to discover the problem was that I'd told iTunes to sort by year.

Shortly after I upgraded to El Capitan, I found that Boot Camp Assistant refused to run, reporting \"This Mac does not support Boot Camp\".\nFurthermore, I am unable to use BootChamp to reboot into Windows, as it reports a cryptic message \"Bless failed\".\nAny ideas what would cause Boot Camp to stop working?\n\nA: The solution for fixing Boot Camp Assistant was the same as with previous versions of the OS: reset the NVRAM.\nI found a discussion mentioning a similar problem with an upgrade to Yosemite here that I intiially disregarded as it referenced repairing permissions and running a Disk Verify, neither of which Disk Utility appears to support anymore.\nAs for BootChamp, it is no longer supported as of El Capitan.  System Integrity Protection prevents it from running.\n", "Q: Can someone help me to translate this automator workflow to applescript? \nWhat I want to do is select a bunch of images with varying dimensions and uniformly apply a percentage scale to resize them. The workflow comes very close to that. But I cant get more specific to the nearest tenths. By pixels it only takes length into consideration whereas I want the width. So i figured as long as it is in applescript I can easily specify the scale I want. I intend to run the script as a service. \n\nA: You can use a \"Run Shell Script\" action and sips to downscale your pictures to any value. Add a \"Run Shell Script\" action, make sure the input method is set to \"stdin\" (should be the default) and insert the following script\nSCALEFACTOR=500\nwhile IFS= read file; do\n    sips --resampleWidth $(($(sips -g pixelWidth \"$file\" |\n                                  sed -n -e '/pixelWidth/s/.*pixelWidth: //p')\n                            * $SCALEFACTOR / 1000)) \"$file\" --out \"${file%/*}/resized-${file##*/}\"\ndone\n\nShell arithmetic only supports integer values, so you'll have to specify the scale factor in thousands (e.g. 424 for 42.4%)\n", "Q: GarageBand sound holding/freezing when multiple notes are played on USB keyboard I just bought a MIDI to USB cable so I could connect my electronic piano/keyboard to my mac mini. I open GarageBand and the keyboard will play one note at a time just fine, but if I play two or more notes at once, then the sound will kind of spaz out, with the two or three notes just lasting forever and no sound from any new notes being played. The sound only stops if I hit the spacebar about two or three times (to press play and stop). \nThe keyboard and mac mini I'm using never did this with the last MIDI to USB cable I had been using previously, I only stopped using that one because it was borrowed and I had to return it. The new looks pretty much the same as the old one though, are MIDI to USB cables not all created equal or something? How can I get GarageBand to play/record what I play even when I press more than one note? \n\nA: Buy a new midi cord.\nI'm not sure why the first one didn't work, but I eventually bought a new midi cord/cable(s) and now the above problem doesn't happen.\n", "Q: Is there a way to customize the color of visited links? I am an Apple user, and am currently using the Chrome and Vivaldi browsers. Not a computer programmer. Is there any easy way to make visited links stand out? The default color for those isn't defining enough for me, I would like the color to be more noticeable.\n\nA: There is. \nThe color of a visited link is determined by the people who have designed the website you are visiting. Most sites will show links and visited links in the same color, but Google for example use different colours so that you can see which sites you have visited. This can be useful if you're trying to find back the site you've visited, or rather if you don't want to visit this site again and want to try another of the search results. \nThe way Google does this is by putting this into something called a Cascading Style Sheet (CSS), which are effectively instructions for your browser on how Google wants it to look in the browser. CSS allows for different link 'states' to have a different color.\nSome examples ... \n/* unvisited link */\na:link {\n    color: green;\n}\n\n/* visited link */\na:visited {\n    color: green;\n}\n\n/* mouse over link */\na:hover {\n    color: red;\n}\n\n/* selected link */\na:active {\n    color: yellow;\n}\n\nIn addition to this, some browsers allow you to \"overrule\" the way a site operator wants their site to look by letting you apply your own CSS to a site.\nChrome used to allow users to directly enter this type of custom CSS. Nowadays, Chrome only allows this through the use of a plugin. Stylebot is one of them, Stylish another. \nVivaldi is a browser I'm not familiar with. A quick Google search indicates that potentially aforementioned Stylebot can also be used for Vivaldi, but perhaps someone with more expertise on this specific browser can help out on more specific instructions.\n", "Q: Left command key does not work My left ⌘ (command key) doesn't respond, while the right ⌘ key works fine.\n\n\n*\n\n*my Mac: MacBook Pro (Retina, Mid 2012)\n\n*on keyboard viewer: when I click left ⌘ no respond on keyboard viewer, but right ⌘ and all other keys have.\n\n*I have opened the left ⌘ key, nothing seems wrong with it.

If that works (i.e. you boot into Recovery mode), then try doing the same with the left command key.\nIf that fails, you have a defect keyboard that needs replacement.\n", "Q: How do I unlock an iPhone 6? I recently bought the phone in Japan because it is way cheaper but then I am unable to use my local SIM card (Indonesia). Please anyone kindly assist and solve this (free method). Thanks in advance! \n\nA: The iPhone is most likely carrier locked and unless you speak Japanese you might be out of luck. As for pricing this will depend on the carrier but have you tried different SIM cards and what country are you in?\n", "Q: Why for some actions wifi is required (ie. cellular is not enough)? Synchronizing iCloud photo library and downloading apps over 100 MB both require wifi, ie. they are not permitted when on cellular.\nIs this limit only for \"convenience\", so there wouldn't be surprises when the phone bill arrives? Is there any official reason? Or technical?\nI'm asking this as my current cellular plan (LTE) consistently delivers better speeds than my current ADSL plan (= wifi) and I have plenty of headroom in my transfer quota.\n\nA: That mechanism is in place to protect customers unaware of the data limits and to conserve the network's bandwidth, this means that everyone gets an equal share of the network. Although what I normally do is USB tether to my Mac then Wi-Fi share the USB connection then connect to that with my iPhone \n", "Q: Reducing System Volume How do I halve the system volume?\nI want one bar (out of sixteen) of volume to be as loud as half a bar etc.\nHow does one do this?\n\nA: There is no way to do this, as you can't set a volume restriction (as you can with iOS) and no apps that I know of can do this. One thing you can do, however, is hold down option and shift as you change the volume (Lion or newer, including El Capitan) and it will change in one-quarter-notch increments, allowing for the greater precision I think you desire.\n", "Q: prevent networksetup from asking for password I am trying to get rid of password when changing proxy with networksetup.

I am using El Capitan 10.11.4.\nThe encryption and decryption process ITSELF works fine, i.e. I can send and receive encrypted and/or signed mails and decrypt them correctly when I have the corresponding certificate.\nHowever, if I receive mails that are encrypted or signed and encrypted, it doesn't show in the security header. It's just not there.\nIf I receive mails that are only signed using S/MIME, it will show correctly however (Signed (John Doe))\nAgain, I can read the mail just fine, it just doesn't give me any indication that it's encrypted or signed.\nOn my iPhone it works fine, i.e. it will show the little lock and the \"signed symbol\".\nWhat could be causing this?\nPS: The \"security header\" I'm talking about should be this: \n\nA: It is most certainly a bug that needs to be addressed in future versions of OS X.\nI have the same problem and have found out the following curiosities:\n\n\n*\n\n*When I added a rule to change the color of encrypted emails to give at least a visual indication in the list view, it worked fine, so there's really no reason not to show the lock icon.\n\n*The moment I added the rule and applied it to existing mails, both the signed and encrypted indications showed properly on the conversation\n\n*Upon restarting Apple Mail however, the signed indicator stopped working again on mails that were both signed and encrypted\n\n*Furthermore, both indicators stopped working on mails which I have sent\n\n*Based on a rough guess, about 50-60% of the encrypted mails now have the proper visual indicator, but only those I've received and not those I have sent.\n\n\nAll in all it's very weird, non-deterministic behavior that I can't explain other than being a bug. It persists in 10.11.5. Mails that are only signed always show properly unless they're also encrypted.\nFurthermore, my iPhone seems to have no problem at all, tagging all signed and/or encrypted conversations properly.\nI suggest filing a bug report with Apple (which I am about to do now).\n\nA: For me, this issue has been solved with macOS Sierra 10.12.2.\nHowever, note that macOS Sierra obviously checks some certificate constraints defined in RFC2312 S/MIME Version 2 Certificate Handling that former OS X versions seemed to handle more generously. Restrictions I found are:\n\n*\n\n*Extension \"Key Usage\" MUST have been marked \"critical\" (this wasn't required in earlier OS X versions)\n\n*Extension \"Basic Constraints\" MUST NOT be marked \"critical\"\n\n*the recipient e-mail address should occur in the \"alternate name\" section as \"RFC 822 name\", as all clients MUST use it there, while not all use the owner e-mail address of the certificate\n\nHOWEVER, Apple mail still does not show the encryption symbol for some messages we encrypt with openssl using the same certificates that work otherwise. I have not been able to find the cause for this yet.\n", "Q: Android Studio 2.1 very slow build, macbook blows very loud I am using new version of Android Studio since one week (v2.1) and it completely freezes my macbook.

My girlfriend forgot the password for her MacBook (don't ask), so I reset it using the Utilities.\nBut as you may be aware, this doesn't reset the Keychain password. Her MacBook is now virtually unusable due to Keychain demands continuously provoking a request for the Keychain password.\nThere are lots of other people asking this around the web and they're usually pointed towards this Apple support page, which doesn't apply in our situation because the support advice involves entering the old password.\nWe don't know the old password.\nIs it possible to reset Keychain without knowing the old password? We're not bothered about what's in there and what will be lost, we just want the continuous password prompts to go away.\n\nA: An administrator can change your login password without knowing the old password. The is no way for anyone to change a keychain password without knowing the old password.\nNormally your login password is the same as the keychain password. For you to change your login password, you need to enter the old password and new password. After the software changes your login password, an attempt is made to change the keychain password. This only succeeds if the old  password you entered is the current keychain password. If not, then the current keychain password remain unchanged.\nWhen an administrator overrides you old login password with a new password, the old password is never entered into the software. Without the old login password, the software can not change the keychain password. If you do not know the old password (i.e. the current keychain password), then you have to \"Create a new login keychain\". Doing so erases all the passwords stored in the keychain.\nThis throwing away the keychain with all the data “resets” the slate and you won’t have prompts with the new keychain that you can’t unlock since you now know the correct password to unlock. \n", "Q: itunes connect tax form outside US I'm trying to setup my tax information on itunes connect as a New Zealand citizen. \nI imagine I should leave fields 5,6,7 and 8 blank as I do not have business, employee, benefits or TAX number in the US. \nI guess I should also leave field 9 & 10 blank as I do not have any tax benefits within New Zealand.\nCan anyone with with similar experience please advise?\n\n\nA: The answer I received from Apple:\nUnder our current model, application sales by non-U.S. developers on the App Store are not subject to U.S. tax withholding or reporting. \nTherefore, completion of Part III - Claim of Tax Treaty Benefits, is not required in order to certify your foreign status.

I currently have installed node and npm with the installer provided from their website. Although I have homebrew installed as well, and running brew doctor seems to complain about some files installed by the node js installer at /usr/local/include/.\nIs installing node through homebrew a better way (e.g. easier to manage, less errors and warnings, etc.)?\n\nA: I find the best way to install Node.js is to use nvm, which allows you to install and manage multiple versions of Node.\nI use Homebrew for pretty much everything else, but Node is easier to use through nvm, since it doesn't use global folders - everything is in your home directory, and you can easily switch between Node versions.\nTo install (check the website for the latest version):\ncurl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.31.0/install.sh | bash\n\nThere are some specific notes about OS X on the web site, please make sure to read through those, e.g. regarding the use of the ~/.bash_profile file.\nAfter that, the nvm function will allow you to specify which version of node to install and use. In the simplest case, you run\nnvm install node\n\nwhich will install the stable version of Node.js.\n\nA: I would use volta to install node and npm\nYou need to put the volta directory (default ~/.volta/bin on your path.\nThen for node (and npm would be similar)\n# install Node\nvolta install node\n\n# start using Node\nnode\n\nWHat volta does is put node etc into volta's directory.\nvolta also allows you to use different versions of node/npm and other downloaded javascript files in different projects.\nThe benefit here for homebrew users is that node and npm are not in /usr/local/bin and so brew doctor will not find a problem. volta can be installed via HomeBrew.\n", "Q: iCloud says that backups are using 3 GB of space, but there are no backups My iCloud account shows that I have ~3 GB of backups, but when I check on all devices using this account, backups are off and no backups are showing.\n\nThe storage bar.\n\nThe backups list... empty!\n\nA: It appears you are looking at the iCloud info in System Preferences on an Apple laptop or desktop. Inside System Preferences, after you click on iCloud, you then click on Manage in the lower right corner. When that window comes up, the top option is highlighted but not necessarily selected. If it's not selected, the backups will not show in the right column. Click on Backups to make sure it is selected.\nI also would recommend signing into www.iCloud.com and verifying that you have no backups in the cloud.

So, will this be a complimentary iPhone replacement or will it cost money like a screen repair?\nEdit: It was, in the end, replaced free of charge.\n\nA: It might be free. I had an iPhone 6 replaced for free just last month. The iPhone was 6 months out of warranty, no AppleCare, but was having battery problems. Apple determined the battery was defective and replaced it for free. \n\nA: Apple Store will diagnose hardware/software and replace iOS software at no charge.\n", "Q: MacBook Air charging light stays amber and does not go green and machine does not boot or even chime I have an 11\" MacBook Air 6,1 from mid 2013 that I found discarded and had restored but now seems dead again.\nI got the machine with a broken screen backlight and missing SSD. I took it to the Genius Bar and they diagnosed only those two problems. I attached it to an external monitor and USB 3.0 hard drive and installed El Capitan and used it for a couple of days. Everything worked except the webcam. Though the machine had sat for several weeks with no power before I acquired it the battery life turned out to be very good.\nI put it to sleep when the battery charge indicator had just gone red and did not have access to a charger/power supply for over a day.\nWhen I was able to borrow a friend's power supply the light did not come on. After finding another Mac user we plugged each other's Magsafe into each other's machines and both lights came on. When I went back to the first charger on my machine the light then stayed amber but the machine would not boot and would not even make the startup \"chime\" sound. I kept it plugged in all day yesterday and the charger light never went green.\nI tried resetting the EMC to no avail. I can't seem to find information on this specific problem online. I can't get a reservation at the Genius Bar for another five days.\n\nA: I had a similar thing happen to my old Macbook. I discharged the battery all the way down and then couldn't recharge it for about two days. When I finally could charge it, it wouldn't charge or turn on. It turned out to be the battery. You can probably get a replacement battery from Apple (if it turns out to be the battery), but I found cheaper options on Amazon.\n", "Q: Move Apps from old hard drive My 2009 MacBook's hard drive failed this weekend and I had to have it replaced on the spot or wait 3 days.

My cousin contacted me for tech support because her computer was refusing to boot to the startup drive, and the issue turned out to be a corrupted drive that Disk Utility refused to fix, telling us to format the drive. I looked for a way to back up her files and found this answer, which says that you can use Recovery HD's Terminal's cp command.\nHer computer is currently running cp -pRv \"/Volumes/Macintosh HD/\" \"/Volumes/EHD\" and it seems to be working, copying every file on her computer to her external drive. Since it's not Time Machine, though, putting everything back in its place is going to be a hassle. I was wondering, once we format the drive, could we just use cp again? How much of the setup process would that get done for us?\nTo clarify, could we, for example, not even bother reinstalling OS X or anything, just run cp -pRv \"/Volumes/EHD/\" \"/Volumes/Macintosh HD\"? Would that restore everything and make it functional?\n\nA: Yes, you could just copy it back, but it may not be bootable.  That can be fixed by installing OS X over the top of your files. It should preserve what is there and make it bootable.  \n\nA: The problem you encounter was exactly the same as mine. You can use the dd command. It does a sector by sector clone from your hard disk to another hard disk. Unlike Disk Utility, it doesn't throw you any error.\nsudo dd if=/dev/disk0 of=/dev/disk2 bs=128m conv=noerror,sync\nThis is the command, which I got from AskDifferent, where if=/dev/disk0 refers to the source that dd is cloning from and of/=dev/disk2 is the destination. I don’t know much about setting the right byte sector, so I left it as bs=128m.

When viewing a file in Adobe Acrobat Pro XI on OSX Yosemite, I sometimes want to send the file to another application. To create an action in KeyboardMaestro, I need to get the path of the currently-open file from Acrobat. How can I get the path? \nA way to send the value to the clipboard would be enough; getting a value I can manipulate in AppleScript would be even better.\n\nA: Using in part the approach from this answer, I eventually developed the following bit of code. Note that this uses the application bundle id instead of the application name, so that it works in more versions of Acrobat Pro.\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    tell application id \"com.adobe.Acrobat.Pro\"\n        set thefile to the file alias of the active doc\n    end tell\nend tell\nset the clipboard to the POSIX path of thefile\n\nTested using Acrobat Pro (version 11) and Acrobat Pro DC (version 17).\n\nA: So here's an AppleScript that I pasted together with the help of some other answers and the AppleScript reference. This puts the URL of the frontmost Acrobat document to the clipboard, e.g:\nfile://localhost/Users/Your%20Username/Documents/Some%20Folder/Filename.pdf\n tell application \"System Events\"\n        tell process \"Acrobat\"\n            set thefile to value of attribute \"AXDocument\" of window 1\n        end tell\n    end tell\n set the clipboard to thefile\n\n\nA: This script will work with any application that has a “document one” open.

For example, if you drop the icon on the Desktop, the Finder creates an alias icon. If you drop it in a TextEdit document, the PDF is embedded in the text document, etc.  \nI'm not familiar with KeyboardMaestro, but I think it should be able to utilize this standard OS X feature somehow.\nOtherwise you can still use OS X's Automator application and create a small application to drop the document icon onto (e.g. in the Dock) and send the file path to the clipboard. It's quite easy. The steps are: \n\n\n*\n\n*Open the Automator application.\n\n*Choose to create a new Application.\n\n*In the right-hand Actions pane, expand the Library and click Utilities.\n\n*In the list of Actions, drag the action Copy to Clipboard into the left-hand assembly pane.\n\n*Press CMD-S to save the new application, e.g., in the Applications folder.\n\n*Drag the application icon into the Dock. \n\n\nDone.\n\nA: (The manual way)\nCmd-click (or right-click) the Acrobat window title and choose the parent folder.

Despite being a pretty powerful machine, it's rather slow and laggy. I looked into it, and it seems her swap memory is maxing out, even though there's plenty of RAM left:\n\nYet my Mac Pro looks like this:\n\nThis happens consistently, causing the machine to significantly underperform. Is there something wrong with the system, perhaps?\n\nA: This is all anecdotal, tested using a sample size of 2, so barely counts as experiment...\nRestart the Mac, it's been up 12 days. \nThat would be fine for a machine with a lot of RAM, but it's going to hit a low RAM machine harder.\nI'd say the simple solution would be to double the RAM.\nTwo of the machines here are always on, the one with only 10GB RAM used to slow down after only a few days [it now has 26GB & no longer does that], the one with 64GB really never slows down.\nI think the used swap figure only gets reset at reboot, btw. I'm not sure it's necessarily an indicator of current activity [but I'm certainly open to correction on that]\n\nA: I do not know which program you used to generate the output in the screenshot, but assuming it outputs the ordinary figures such as for example Activity Monitor or top would do - the reason for the seemingly erraneous swap usage is simply one of time.\nImagine that a process on your Mac allocates 12 GB of RAM. The system hasn't got 12 GB of free RAM, so it moves something to swap and gives the process its 12 GB of RAM.\nA bit later, the process frees the 12 GB of RAM (i.e. deallocate them). The system now has a lot of free RAM, but is still using a lot of swap space.\nYou could argue that the system should move everything from swap into RAM, but doing so is slow and \"expensive\" in terms of system resources. The system cannot know if you would need the stuff that is in swap first, or you rather want to have free RAM for something else. Therefore it generally opts to keep stuff in swap, and only move it into RAM as necessary.\nThe solution for your problem is to monitor continually over a period of time (for example from boot) to figure out, which process is actually using a lot of RAM for a limited amount of time.\n", "Q: iOS Download .doc file from URL (in Safari) One of our software suppliers normally make .doc 's downloadable via the browser (desktops).

For some months, I have on my account almost 16$, but I am not paid yet.\n\n\n*\n\n*What should I do to receive those money from Apple?\n\n*What is the payment schedule?\n\n*How do I get paid by Apple for App sales?\n\n\nA: This is the direct response from Apple to me:\n\nPayments are made within 45 days of the last day of the fiscal month. To receive payment, you must have completed all documentation, including any required banking and tax information, as well as meeting the minimum payment threshold.\nIf your bank and bank account currency is listed in the table provided in the iTunes Connect Payments and Financial Reports FAQ's labeled WHEN WILL I BE PAID, you must exceed a minimum payment threshold of $10 USD.\nAll other bank countries and bank account currencies must exceed a minimum payment threshold of $150 USD. Earnings that do not meet the minimum payment threshold will be carried over month-to-month until the minimum is met.\n\n\nA: In iTunes Connect, under Agreements, Tax, and Banking, you can add your bank account. Apple will then pay the money into the account when it reaches a certain amount.\n\nA: You can see when any particular payment will be made by logging in to iTunesConnect and going to Payments and Financial Reports. Any payment due to be made will be in the top right, alongside the date it will be made. You may need to go back a month as for some reason ITC only shows the current month, which never seems to have any data in it.\nPayments cover the period displayed in Apple's fiscal calendar https://itunesconnect.apple.com/WebObjects/iTunesConnect.woa/wa/jumpTo?page=fiscalcalendar\n", "Q: How many MB can I send on iMessage? I was wondering if anyone could tell me how many MB I can send over iMessage? And when and why messages get compressed sometimes seemingly by random.

It has typed its own passcode on the lock screen so many times it has disabled the phone so now I can't do anything with it.\nThe lock screen says \"Connect to iTunes,\" but when I try to connect it says that I have to enter the phone's passcode which I can't.\nWhat can I do to back up my phone or connect it to iTunes? If I go to an Apple store, will they replace it or change the phone all together?\n\nA: Sounds like the digitizer (the part that recognizes your touches) is also broken. My experience with Apple store is they will try to replace your screen first (at a cost). \nMany third party repair shops can help you get a working digitizer connected without erasing the device. Expect to pay them extra for the data transfer as part of the repair. You could even just pay them for the data transfer and then go back to Apple for a repair that has warranty from the manufacturer.\n", "Q: Open links in their respective apps? It used to be that if I clicked a web link to an NYTimes article from Safari, the article would open in the NYTimes app. At some point, I must have changed this setting, and now, NYTimes links open in Safari.\nI can't find anything in Safari or the NYTimes app area of Settings that seems to revert to the old behavior, nor in the settings inside the NYTimes app itself. Is there a way to restore the old behavior of opening links in their respective apps?\nEdit: I have NYTimes app installed, I am on iOS 9.3.1, and I am not using private browsing, so some of the typical answers (thanks John Ramos!) aren't helping here.\nI have also tried deleting cookies, history, and local data from Safari, and uninstalling and reinstalling the NYTimes app -- all have no effect.\n\nA: This feature is called Universal Links. You can read Apple's documentation on this here.\nBasically for this to work the developer of the NYTimes website needs to have a file called apple-app-site-association on their server. You can view that file on the NYTimes website here http://nytimes.com/apple-app-site-association. Within the file they can specify which URLs are redirected (on the NYTimes site, any that have a year between 2000 and 2099 immediately after the domain name) and which apps they are redirected to (four NYTimes apps). At a glance the file looks okay on their website, but interestingly it does mean that only links like this http://www.nytimes.com/2016/... will work, while anything else like this for example http://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2016/... will not. So right away it is worth noting that they've decided that they don't want all links to the nytimes.com website to open in their apps.\nThey also need to change a setting within their iOS apps to list which domains it is willing to receive links from. This takes the form of an entitlement called com.apple.developer.associated-domains. Due to the way their app is configured I'm unable to check the plist files within their app to see if they are configured correctly. But in my own testing, this feature seems to work okay. When I go to this article I've randomly picked on DaringFireball and click on the NYTimes link, the NYTimes app automatically launches and opens the article rather than Safari.\nWhat may have happened is that you can tell iOS that you don't want it to pass Universal Links from Safari to the relevant app. You do this by clicking on the link that appears in the top-right corner of the screen when iOS has opened an app with a Universal Link. From that point on iOS will ignore the Universal Link feature for that site. This is fairly non-intuitive, so you might have done this without realising that it disables the Universal Links feature for the site.\n\nThere are two methods to re-enable Universal Links for that site. Either long press on a NYTimes link and select \"Open in \"NYTimes\" from the menu, or open the NYTimes website in Safari and click on the \"OPEN\" link in the Smart App Banner at the top of the site.\n\n\nLet us know how you get on.\n\nA: This seems like a end user question, so I will answer as such. There is a 3rd party app called \"Opener\" (it's not free, but super cheap) that allows you to open in a supported app through their third party app. You click on the \"export\" icon along the top navigation of the browser:\n\nAdditionally if you came about the URL from a search engine (in Safari) you can open the URL clicking on the \"info\" icon in the pre-header and if the developer universally linked it will open in their app (irrespective of if it's active or closed).\n\nA: The New York Times seemed to change the way their website handles links, as my iPhone does not open NYTimes articles in the app either. Most likely, the developers of nytimes.com decided to stop the site from auto-opening articles in the app because people we having trouble with it not working (or worse, asking you to download the app, interrupting your reading). The mobile NYTimes website is good enough that they may have decided to simplify the process by just having you read the article on the web. \nOne workaround: save the article for later from the web, then go to the Saved section in the NYTimes app and your article will be waiting for you in the app.\nCredits to user fbara for suggesting the \"web developer's fault\" theory in the comments above.\n", "Q: Voice feedback loop into the headphones Is there a way on a Mac to have the input from the microphone be played in the headphones so I can listen to my own voice? Talking when you can't listen to yourself is a bit awkward\n\nA: There's always LineIn (I'm not the developer), which allows you to route audio from different inputs to different outputs as you choose.\nThe setup for routing audio from the microphone (or any other input source) to the speakers is as follows:\n\nTo start or stop audio routing, click the Play Thru button.\n\nA: Head into QuickTime Player, go to File menu then New Audio Recording. Now there will be a sound slider on the bottom. Drag that slider all the way up to turn on full volume. Now click on the arrow beside the record button and make sure the microphone is selected. Now everything you said will go into QT Player and routed out into the headphone. Note that you don't have to click the record button for this to work.\n", "Q: iTerm text search is in reverse order I'm running iTerm2. When do a text search ⌘ F, pressing Return moves the highlighted occurrence back (the previous occurrence). Is there a way to make it move to the next (forward) occurrence?\n\nA: Searching in reverse is apparently how iTerm's search works by design (see https://gitlab.com/gnachman/iterm2/issues/4491).\nAs a user, I also find this design decision confusing.\nIf you would like to make Find Next / Find Previous in iTerm behave consistently with other apps, here are the proper keybinding overrides to add in System Preferences > Keyboard.\nNote that I had to restart iTerm for the keybindings to fully take effect.\n\n\nA: Like @Taylor D. Edmiston said, this is iTerm's default behavior. However, there's now an iTerm2 setting in Preferences > Advanced > General to revert that behavior to \"normal\" when set to \"No\" (next is down, previous is up):\nhttps://gitlab.com/gnachman/iterm2/-/issues/2049\n\nCommit a99ed9b1 adds an advanced preference named \"Swap Find Next and Find Previous\". It defaults to \"Yes\". When disabled, search acts like a standard application. The only thing the setting does not affect is key bindings, which presumably work the way you want, and are also labeled \"find up\" and \"find down\" which is unambiguous.\n\nThe numeration is still \"backward\" (e.g. 1/20 will be the lowest down text match) but otherwise works the same as you would expect of other applications.\n\n\nA: Try using Shift+Enter to reach the next occurrence. \n", "Q: How to quit \"Force Quit Applications\" using AppleScript?

When you want to view a password via the Keychain Access GUI, you are asked the admin password. However, OS X also provides a command to export all Keychain Access passwords to a text file, unencrypted:\nsecurity dump-keychain -d login.keychain > keychain.txt\n\nThis command does not require sudo privileges.\nSo I have two questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*How can I add the sudo privilege requirement to the security command.\n\n*Is this behaviour intended or is it a major inconsistency with regards to security concerns at Apple ?\n\n\nA: The security command is working as expected, and is following the same keychain access policies that any other program would follow.\n\n\n*\n\n*Accessing a user's keychain is not an admin function -- the user's keychain belongs to them, so admin access is irrelevant. On the other hand, the System keychain (/Library/Keychains//System.keychain) is \"owned by\" the system, so admin access might be needed for it and/or its items.\n\n*To gain access to the user's keychain, it must first be unlocked. login.keychain is normally encrypted with the user's login password, and is automatically unlocked when they log in. If it weren't already unlocked, security would trigger a prompt for the password to unlock it.\n\n*Each item in the keychain has its own access policy. You can see these in the Keychain Access utility by double-clicking the keychain item, then selecting the Access Control tab. security obeys these access controls: if it's set to \"Allow all applications to access this item\", security will dump the item without prompting for anything; if it's set to \"Confirm before allowing access\" (and security isn't in the \"Always allow...\" list), security will trigger a prompt for access to the item (and if \"Ask for keychain password\" is selected as well, the prompt will require the keychain password).\nIt might be possible to require admin rights to run security, but I wouldn't recommend it. Firstly, it might break any parts of the OS that depend on running security (though I don't know of any), and secondly it wouldn't prevent any other program from dumping out the keychain, since other programs are subject to the same access policies.\n", "Q: Should there be a hardlink from `/Users/Users` pointing to `/Users`?

I just purchased one to fix a friends 2012 MBA and it was super easy to fix.  You just have to remove the back cover and one screw holds this board in place.  It removes pretty easily.\n\nA: Reboot your mac. thats all... really...\n", "Q: Charger with burning smell The MacBook charger has frayed/ broken plastic near the connection to the box on the charger. It will only charge while in certain positions and gets hot and has a burning smell. How can I fix this? I'm hoping wrapping it with electric tape will be enough?\n\nA: It's not worth the potential fire hazard. If you go to Apple.com and look at the reviews on the MacBook chargers, people are very frustrated with the need to replace the chargers so frequently due to wear exactly where you described it. I would highly recommend replacing the charger over repairing it.\n", "Q: how do i disable my messages from showing up on my macbook air Recently I allowed my laptop to get messages that have been sent to my phone, but that was a huge mistake. I have a macbook air and I do not need to disconnect my phone from my laptop, I just need to disable my laptop from receiving or even seeing my messages. \n\nA: Open Preferences in the Messages app and log out of your Apple ID. That will prevent your device from receiving any messages there.\nAdditionally you can disable message forwarding in the Messages settings on your iPhone.\n", "Q: Problem Setting Up iPhone 5s I just purchased an iPhone (on Sprint), my first one, off of Craigslist. However I am having a problem: I get home and connect it to Wi-Fi and it says I need a SIM card. I looked online a bit to see if I can buy one, but I've heard if you go to Apple you'll get into trouble with them. I took a screenshot of the Craigslist ad, just in case. I was wondering if there's a way to buy a SIM card. I think it's a used phone, but on the ad it says new but out doesn't look new, if it makes a difference. I really want to know where can I get a SIM card, how will I be able to use it, how much it is, etc.\n\nA: Go to a shop selling Sprint contracts/SIMs and buy one.\n\nA: First of all, congratulations on buying your first iPhone. :) They truly are the best phones.\nNow, about your post: \nThere's nothing bad about buying a used iPhone, as long as it's not iCloud locked. I've done it many times; the iPhone 6s I'm typing this on is the only iPhone I've ever bought new. \nThe seller was right in not selling you the SIM card with the iPhone, as it's his and he just put it into whatever other phone he's using now to continue his service.\nIf your old phone (if you had one) was on Sprint and takes a nano-SIM card, all you need to do is stick a paper clip in the hole on the side opposite the volume buttons on your iPhone to pop the SIM card tray out and insert your old SIM. See this Apple Support article for more help.\nIf not, you just need to take it into the nearest Sprint store and the representative there should be able to help you. You'll need a cellular plan for it and the SIM should cost anywhere from free to $20.\n", "Q: Running Ubuntu on MacBook Pro 2015 — run natively (dual boot) or run in virtual machine for longer battery life? I currently use Ubuntu in a virtual machine, using VirtualBox software on my host operating system, OS X, on my MacBook Pro 2015.\nHowever, the battery life drains quickly when Ubuntu is used continuously. The battery life only lasts about four hours at the best. If I do not run Ubuntu, the battery life would be about seven hours.\nWill the battery life be longer if I run Ubuntu natively (dual boot), or if I run Ubuntu in a virtual machine, with VirtualBox software?\n\nA: Booting Ubuntu on a dual boot partition has a similar battery life to OS X, perhaps slightly shorter, due to less efficient optimization for the MacBook Pro's hardware.\nIn a virtual machine, despite lots of \"clever\" optimizations and CPU hardware virtualization features, there are two complete operating systems, with two kernels, and two display managers* running. There is no way around the fact that these require significantly more processing power, thus, sucking up more battery life.\nIf you want longer battery life in Ubuntu, try disabling the eye candy. (This, of course, is assuming the virtual machine is not running headless.)\n\nA: Note that it looks like the VirtualBox in particular has very poor battery efficiency when compared to other virtual machine emulators. I came across this page below that benchmarked different vms and found that running Windows in Parallels or Fusion on a Mac results in the battery lasting nearly twice as long as VirtualBox.\nDetails at https://www.tekrevue.com/2015-vm-benchmarks-parallels-11-vs-fusion-8/13/\n\nA: I am not using other OS X apps while working in ubuntu which is anyway my main OS. I decided to go for virtualbox since I can take full advantage of the power saving features of OS X and still use the builtin webcam, the audio system, and USB devices in ubuntu.\nI am running virtualbox (at this point 5.1.26) on a Macbook 2015 (OS X 10.11.6) with 8GB RAM and CPU capable of running 4 threads. The default settings were not the best (when playing back videos on the VM) and I needed some tweaking. I am using xubuntu (currently 16.04). I have assigned 3 CPUs despite the warning in VBox and about half of the RAM.\nThe most annoying tweak is the fact that xubuntu does not like the high native screen resolution. I am using the scripts below to reduce resolution on the OS X side. This works very well and does not give the pixelish appearance of downscaling in virtualbox.\nHere is the code you'll need - thanks to those who wrote it:\nhttps://gist.github.com/atr000/207602\nCreate yourself e.g. a BASH script called set_1440x900.sh\n\n#!/bin/bash\n\n/Users/myusername/Apps/setgetscreenres/setgetscreenres 1440 900\n\nwhich would set to 1440x900, a perfect resolution for 10 inch Retina macbooks (e.g. 2015 model).\nYou can also create an AppleScript application to call the script using the OS X Script Editor in Utilities. You can save this as \"Application\" and then add it to the dock.\n\ndo shell script\"/Users/myusername/Apps/setgetscreenres/set_1440x900.sh\"\n\nAfter rebooting OS X, which I rarely do, I just click once on this application, and the screen resolution is (smoothly) reduced. It will look blurred for a while, but after a while, you will no longer miss the Retina native resolution, if you work in Xubuntu. If you want to go back to native retina resolution, you can choose any of the modes from the \"System Preferences\" > \"Display\". You would probably do this if you would like to work with a native OS X application.\nVideos in fullscreen mode now will run smoothly in xubuntu. If you close your macbook, you will send the virtualbox to \"save the machine state\" in the background, which is exactly what you will want to do on a laptop. This conveniently happens after a while of inactivity in closed state, i.e. for shorts pauses, you will not have \"wake up breaks\". You can get through a full day with some breaks with a single battery charge (5-6 hours). If you're at a meeting and want to save on battery, slightly dim the display and remove one of the 3 CPUs from the VBox configuration. You might experience some video flickering, but for using google drive, libreoffice, etc., everything will run smoothly.\nUsing this setup you\n-get a long battery life\n-can use native drivers for all hardware\n-have no issues inside VBox with drivers for linux concerning Mac hardware\n-can run other virtual OS in a 2nd and 3rd VBox and exchange data between all OSes easily, including the host OS X\n-don't need to like or be familiar with OS X. You barely don't need to touch it. However, it might come in handy to run some non-free applications, be some firmware updater for a device and alike.\n-can transfer your \"favorite working linux configuration\" easily to any other standard PC, laptop, server, etc. with the same CPU architecture\n-even control homebuilt hardware based on e.g. arduino and ESP32 from inside  virtualbox in a hassle-free manner.\n-do not need to purchase any software license on top of what you get with the computer itself.\n\nA: Yes, running Ubuntu natively (dual booting) may be a better way, but you will lose all \"pros\" of your MacBook Pro 2015 (Mac OS X).\nThere is another way of \"using Ubuntu,\" which is Docker. I bet you have heard of it, but you may not know that the latest Docker beta uses a native virtualization mechanism, and it does not need VirtualBox, or any other virtual machine software, anymore.\n\nA: Are you sure your battery life problems during native boot are OS related?  I would try installing the SMC fan control available from Debian…\nFirst,you will need to navigate to the repository configurations and add the contrib and non-free repositories as follows:\nnano /etc/apt/sources.list\n\nAfter main, add \"contrib\" and \"non-free\" ... For example:\ndeb http://site.example.com/debian distribution main contrib non-free\ndeb-src http://site.example.com/debian distribution main contrib non-free\n\nAfter that ...\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt install macfanctld\n\nThen, once installed, type macfanctl at the shell emulator of your choice.  It will direct you to the config.  Tweak some settings and watch - battery life will improve by a factor of 2/3.\nThis will not impact VM installs, only the first part of your question.\n", "Q: Why does the Terminal app icon show an unread message? For the first time in roughly three years, the Terminal app icon in the dock shows that red new message overlay.\n\nTo the right, the same happens with Thunderbird which I am used to as I do have three new emails. But what does that new message overlay in Terminal app mean?\nI have no new mail in /var/mail/$USER nor does Terminal show any message when started.\n\nA: That badge indicates a \"beep\" that happened while the terminal was not in the foreground. \nTo see it, you can send a beep command to your terminal.

Or is it stuck on? Or you were just wondering where it came from?\n\nA: This red circle in any application isn't limited to signal a new message.\nIt means that the application had to signal you a new event when no window was active.\nFor some applications this might mean:\n\n\n*\n\n*an update is necessary,\n\n*an error occured,\n\n*a new message arrived,\n\n*an important refresh of the window content occured.\n\n\nIn the case of Terminal this might have been caused by a background job terminating, a shell exit on error, the use of biff, talk, wall, write...\n\nA: Expanding beroe's answer..\n\nThat badge indicates a \"beep\" that happened while the terminal was not in the foreground.\n\nIt is a badge per tab, or per window.

I just received a  MacBook Pro from somebody else because it was running too slow. Booting up takes about 4 minutes. \nI have tried formatting the drive and reinstalling the operating system from scratch. The reinstall takes about 8 hours and in the end it doesn't work, or boot up is just as slow as it was before. The computer especially seems to run slow while doing system/hard drive things with it. \nI want to know if getting a new hard drive will fix my problems. Is there a way to test my hard drive to know for certain that it is the problem? I don't want to waste my money on a SSD if it's not even going to make a difference. \nI've live booted Linux on which runs beautifully on it which is why I'm thinking it is probably the hard drive's fault.\nHere are some more details about the MacBook Pro:\n\n\n*\n\n*OS X El Capitan\n\n*Version 10.11.3\n\n*MacBook Pro (13-inch, Mid 2012)\n\n*Processor 2.5 GHz Intel Core i5\n\n*Memory 4 GB 1600 MHz DDR3\n\n*Startup Disk Macintosh HD\n\n*Graphics Intel HD Graphics 4000 1536 MB\n\n\nA: I have the same model of Macbook which was showing the same issues. After replacing the Harddrive with an SSD I still had the same issue. \nIt ended up being the SATA cable connecting the hard drive to the logic board. Over some time the insulation had started to wear off and the cable was occasionally shorting against the base of the case causing IO errors. Once I replaced the cable these errors stopped happening.\nA good way of checking this would be to use an external USB to SATA cable and try and boot the laptop from it externally. If the drive functions well when doing this then it is likely the SATA cable that is at fault.\n\nA: I have the same MacBook Pro. I did the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*I bought a SSD and replaced the hard drive disk. I installed OS X on the SSD. (240 GB - $100).\n\n*I inserted 8 GB of RAM (replace the two 2 GB RAM) ( 2 x 4 GB - $50).\n\n*Then I replaced the SuperDrive with .... the old HDD. You need to buy an adapter. (Adapter on Amazon - $30).\nYes it's expensive, but it takes 10 seconds to boot (password typing included).\nBecause new operating systems increase the access to HDD and the original HDD in the MacBook Pro, Mid 2012, is only 5400 RPM, it may be slow.\n\nA: First, Some Diagnostics\nWhile SSD's will give you a boost in speed simply replacing one with the hopes it solves a problem could get expensive.  Let's verify that the problem is the drive in the first place and not something else.\nIf you can log into your system, open Terminal and issue the command\ndiskutil list\nYou will get a listing of all your drives on that particular machine.  Find the one that corresponds to your boot drive.  Chances are it will be /dev/disk0 but you will want to make sure.\nNext, you will want to get the SMART status of the drive.  Issue the command, substituting your drive label if different\ndiskutil info /dev/disk0 | grep -i smart\nIf you get anything other than \"Verified,\" your drive is in the process of failing and it's time to replace it.\nNext, download a drive utility App like DriveDX that will give you in depth diagnostics about your drive.  \nIf everything passes there, it's time to look into Apple Hardware Test.  It involves disconnecting everything but your mouse and keyboard, and while booting from a powered off state, hold down the D key.  Choose to \"Perform Extended Testing\"  If it provides you with an error, make note of it so you can provide it to us.  Also, be sure to visit the link I provided for details.\nHow to Fix...\nChances are, it's going to be your HDD, but you want to do diagnostics first so you're not spending time and money trying replacing a drive when the problem is your logic board.  According to Everymac.com, your MBP came with a 500GB SATA HDD\n\nThat spinning drive is now at least 4 years old and is close to EOL.  If it turns out that your drive is failing, it's pretty easy to replace with an SSD.  To see how to replace, take a look at this post that already details how to do this:  My Mac is getting really slow, what should I do?\nWhile You're There...\nEverymac.com also lists your max memory as 16GB.  You should consider upgrading your memory as well given how cheap memory prices are today.  For your specific Mac, I found this Kingston 8GB Module (you will need two).  \n\nIf it's Your Logic Board...\nIf you run Apple Hardware Test and you come to the conclusion that it's your logic board, you will have to start making some decisions whether you want to repair/replace your logic board ($300 to $700).  Depending on exactly what is involved, it may make sense to just part out the MBP and purchase a new one.\n\nA: You will diagnose that you have a serious disk problem by looking at\n/var/log/system.log\n\nand more specifically with:\ngrep disk /var/log/system.log\n\nThese error messages will clearly show if your disk is producing I/O error on the same location, which will indicate a disk problem, or on multiple locations which will indicate a bus or logic problem.\nI have not any evidence of an OS or software which is able to disambiguate these 2 kinds of problems.\n\nI want to know if getting a new hard drive will fix my problems.\n\nFrom the information provided thus far, there isn't the smallest evidence that your problem is coming from your disk. In term of probability, if your MacBook Pro didn't receive too many vertical shock (falling on the desk or on the ground or running on board of train or plane) your disk is 2 years away of its deadline (I estimate it to be end 2017).\n", "Q: How to clean install OSX without formatting drive? What's the best way to clean install (not upgrade) OSX (from 10.10 to 10.11) without formatting my drive?\nThis is a MBPr with a 1TB internal, where I have 700GB of media that I would like to leave on there, all within 2 folder at /\nCan I just delete everything except those 2 folders then install OSX?\nI'm thinking I have 2 options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot from a bootable USB with 10.11 installer\n\n*Boot from a CCC clone external of my system drive\n\n\n... and then delete everything except those 2 folders, then run the OSX installer.\n\nA: There is no easy way to do this. You can't clean install and keep your files because those files live as part of the OS. The OS knows where they are, what they are, the permissions etc.  Clean installing would be removing all parts of the OS and installing a the new OS and the links to those files, where it would not know it needs those files or what they are.\nAlternatively you can try:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a New Partition (Say of 200GB)\n\n*Install a clean copy of OS X there\n\n*Copy 100GB of your files to the new partition\n\n*Delete those exact files on the old partition\n\n*Shrink old partition and expand new partition\n\n*And repeat last 3 steps till you have all files\n\n\nBut the best solution would be:\n\n\n*\n\n*Buy external HD\n\n*Copy all files to external\n\n*Reinstall OS X\n\n*Copy files back\n\n\nA: The only thing I can suggest is to boot to the Recovery partition (⌘ Cmd+R), and do the command in Terminal (Utilities > Terminal):\nsudo rm -r /folder_name\n\nOn all folders that you don't want to keep.\n(Be carefull when you target your folder, NO RECOVERY possible. Check manual to be sure)\nI'm pretty sure that the installing will not erase the data in folders you kept.\nOr you also try to make another partition on your disk with the disk utility, then install OS X in the new partition, and remove all files from the old OS X installation.\n\nA: If you are trying to preserve files, formatting is not your answer. I suggest an \"in place\" install buy simply downloading the El Capitan installer (or applicable OS) from the Mac App Store. This will download the installer and you may simply re-install the operating system. Leaving all your home folder and additional files intact. This can be achieved by creating a media installer using terminal. You may refer to this Apple support article for a step by step. \n", "Q: What voltage readings should I get from my 60 watt Magsafe? What voltage readings should I get from my 60 watt Magsafe if I check the pins with a multimeter? My readings are all below 1 volt (I checked all combinations of pins), but I don't know if this is correct since there is no load. Also what pins should I check? My computer is a MacBook Pro 2011 early model.\n\nA: A good description can be found at Teardown and exploration of Apple's Magsafe connector\nBelow is taken verbatim from the above link.\nThe charger startup process\nWhen the Magsafe connector is plugged into a Mac, a lot more happens than you might expect. I believe the following steps take place: \n\n\n*\n\n*The charger provides a very low current (about 100 µA) 6 volt signal\non the power pins (3 volts for Magsafe 2).\n\n*When the Magsafe connector is plugged into the Mac, the Mac applies\na resistive load (e.g. 39.41KΩ), pulling the power input low to\nabout 1.7 volts.\n\n*The charger detects the power input has been pulled low, but not too\nlow. (A short or a significant load will not enable the charger.)\nAfter exactly one second, the charger switches to full voltage\n(14.85 to 20 volts depending on model and wattage). There's a 16-bit\nmicroprocessor inside the charger to control this and other charger\nfunctions.\n\n*The Mac detects the full voltage on the power input and reads the\ncharger ID using the 1-Wire protocol.\n\n\nIf the Mac is happy with the charger ID, it switches the power input to the internal power conversion circuit and starts using the input power. The Mac switches on the appropriate LED on the connector using the 1-Wire protocol.\nThis process explains why there is a delay of a second after you connect the charger before the light turns on and the computer indicates the battery is charging. It also explains why if you measure the charger output with a voltmeter, you don't find much voltage. \n\nA: Mixing answers from @David Anderson and @Brandon :\n\nThe inner large pins are V+ (16.5 VDC). Measuring with no load will give 6.86 VDC; the full 16.5 V is provided to the proper load.\nThe outer large pins are Ground.\nThe tiny center pin is a Charge Control pin that assists with changing the LED color, and also assists with switching the adapter off. No power will be output from any of the other pins until contact is made with the center Charge Control pin\n\n\n(Source : ifixit forum)\n\nA: you can touch the cables with your fingers and the resistive load will be applied at the same time with the multimeter. You will get the 16-20V reading. No joke, you will not die from 16V.\n", "Q: Not getting developer option on iPad air In settings I am not getting developer option.\nTried with Xcode 6.1.1 (no clue).\ncan any one help to enable developer option on iPad air.\n\nA: The developer item in settings (called \"ontwikkelaar\" in the screenshot) will become available when you have installed an app you created with xcode.

I was going to use Quicktime to do this but when I choose \"New Screen Recording\" to do this, the audio is never captured.  \nHow can Quicktime be made more useful for screencasts?\nUpdate:  Here are some suggested methods that have been proposed in various forums that simply are not viable:\n\n\n*\n\n*Using a male to male audio cable and connecting the speaker jack to the microphone jack.  This might work on Windows, but Macs only have a single audio jack, ruling this method out.\n\n\nA: You could use Audio Hijack (per Tetsujin) to capture the audio as needed or you could use a USB audio adapter to do it for significantly less.\nI use the Behringer UCA202 Audio Interface with my iMac.  \n\nWhen I needed to record a screencast with the audio from the application, I just used an RCA audio cable I had laying in a drawer similar to the image below.  You don't need anything fancy or expensive, just a standard RCA audio cable.\n\nIn quicktime, I just selected the USB device as my input:\n\nNow, when I say significantly less, Audio Hijack is about $50 if buying the new license.  The USB Audio device is $30 and if you have to buy an RCA audio cable, you're looking at another $5.  So, for $35,  you get an audio interface that has many more uses than the software can provide (for example, I can hook my Bose Wave Radio to my iMac now) whereas the software doesn't allow you to do that.\nMake no mistake, Audio Hijack is good software.  This is just another, albeit less expensive, avenue to solve your problem.\n\nA: Sadly, after much research, the answer to this question is: \"Can't be done.\"  At least not with Quicktime alone.  Quicktime is purposefully crippled and you will never be able to record audio using just it.  \nThe best work around that I have found is to download Jing.  The free version if your screen casts only need to be five minutes long or less, or the paid version if you need longer screencasts.\nI hope that someday Apple will grow a pair and uncripple their software, but until then Quicktime is not a viable self-contained solution for screencasts that include audio.\n\nA: Best free solution (but limited to 5 minutes of each recording) is record video and audio with Jing 2.7.0 which produces SWF and then convert it to mp4. \n\nA: I was able to both record and hear audio using the free iShowU Audio Capture, it is free. Nice instructions with screen caps are at https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/os-x-capture-audio-with-ishowu-audio-capture.505/\nfollow steps 1~5 (steps six is for using OBS Studio - also free).

Hfs+ partition used to be visible in Windows 8.1 Bootcamp.\nBut after updating to Windows 10, it doesn't show up again. I don't enable FileVault. HFS+ drivers installed on Windows 10 with the latest Bootcamp support drivers.\nPlease help! Thank you so much.\nBelow is the output from the following Terminal application commands.\ndiskutil list\ndiskutil cs list\nsudo gpt -r show /dev/disk0\nsudo fdisk /dev/disk0\n\n\n\nA: Your computer uses two partition tables stored on your internal drive. The first is the Master Boot Record (MBR) partition table and the second is the GUID Partition Table (GPT). You used the commands fdisk and gpt to print out most of the contents of the MBR partition table and GPT, respectively.\nFor the most part, Windows (booted via BIOS) ignores the GPT and uses the MBR table exclusively to determine the partitions on your internal drive. For Macs, the usual requirement is for the first partition in the MBR table to have an id=EE. Also this partition should start at a Logical Block Address (LBA) of 1 and end at the same LBA as the EFI partition in the GPT. (The EFI partition has an GUID=C12A7328-F81F-11D2-BA4B-00A0C93EC93B.)\nYour MBR partition table contains the following problems:\n\n\n*\n\n*Your first partition (id=EE) extends past the EFI partition in the\nGPT. In fact, this partition covers the first three partitions in the\nGPT.\n\n*The last partition (number 4) is empty. This probably where the HFS+\npartition information was stored before you updated to Windows 10.\n\n*The partitions are not in ascending order. I do not know if this one\nhas to be fixed. For now, I will ignore this problem.\n\n\nOne of the easiest commands that can fix these types of problems is gdisk. This command can be found in most Linux installs.

Problem is, the display has been broken for a long time, so I have been using an external monitor with it, but I couldn't find a way to get Recovery Mode to display to the external monitor.\nI managed to use the VoiceOver function to erase the hard drive, but because I didn't remember the shortcut to close the window, so I could immediately reinstall OS X, I restarted the computer. \nNow it won't output to the external monitor, and VoiceOver doesn't do anything, so all I have is a blank screen. \nDoes anyone know what this screen looks like and can give some simple guidance so I can reinstall OS X using the keyboard?\nUpdate: I remember it saying that it ran Mac OS X Lion while I was going through the options, and while I'm not sure exactly which type of MacBook Air it is, it is small and its model number is A1370.\nUpdate 2: After leaving it alone for a while, we restarted it holding command+R again, and it worked.

Then, close the lid of the laptop and it should display on the external monitor. \n\nA: The OS doesn't work with the external monitor until a certain phase during the OS installation, or something like that.\nIs the display completely broken or just the backlight? In the latter case the workaround is that the Apple logo on the lid of the MacBook Air allows you to shine a lamp through it to light up the centre part of the internal display just enough to use the GUI there to hopefully get to the stage where it will then enable your external display.\nAt least this worked for me on my 6,1 MacBook Air from mid 2013.\n", "Q: Is this magnetic connector for iPhone approved by Apple? One of the problems with iPhone/iPad cables is that they get bent and damaged. There is a smart idea floating around about a magnetic cable similar to the MacBook one.

I followed the Apple vs FBI case a bit, and I'm super curious how Apple implemented the auto-erase feature. Reading their documentation, it seems like it is as simple as erasing a key that is used to encrypt all the data. Is it actually a microkernel or something?\n\nA: When a wipe occurs, the file system key is deleted. It's as simple as that.\nPage 11 of the September 2015 iOS Security White Paper states that the file system key is stored in NAND.\n\nThe metadata of all files in the file system is encrypted with a random key, which is created when iOS is first installed or when the device is wiped by a user.

I have been having this problem probably ever since I bought my iMac. The Safari browser exhibits weird behaviour when I often navigate to a certain webpage. I do a lot of website development so naturally I have to test my sites. However, Safari seems to be keeping the old copy of the website in memory and keeps loading it! The only option is clearing the browsing data but that leads also to me getting logged out of all sites on the device so it's a pain.\nAn example of what happened today: I had a website that had a <meta> tag redirecting to www.anotherpage.com. I removed that tag and uploaded the file on FTP. However, Safari would still keep redirecting me to that page. When I accessed the same URL from mobile Safari version, everything worked as expected, no redirect. Heck, even Mozilla or Chrome on desktop showed the new site.\nShould I just disable caching or am I missing something? Has anyone experienced similar problem? Or is it only one of the reasons why Safari is becoming the new IE?\n\nA: Safari aggressively caches redirects and force refresh will only force refresh the page you are redirected to, not the redirect itself. You can clear the cache without clearing your browsing data (cookies) by choosing Develop → Empty Caches (⌥⌘E).\n", "Q: Can I find a driver or something to make the EarPod buttons work on Windows 10?

Based on what I see, window has zero radio buttons. This leads to a conclusion that radio buttons are part of sub window, namely the Displays subwindow and not the main window. How can I navigate to this \"subwindow\" and click radiobuttons?\n\n\nA: The radio buttons are contained within a radio group, and the radio group is contained within a tab group. So the following code will give you the names of the radio buttons.\nYou also need to put in a delay between opening the window and trying to talk to it. Even on an SSD equipped Macbook Pro.

Take a look at this answer or you could use TinkerTool\nTo turn the animations back on, you enter the same commands, but with 1 instead of 0\n", "Q: problem with installing Network Storage drivers i have a problem with accessing to my iomega-ix2 network storage. when i read the manual, i found that i have to download and install certain files (download link is in the bottom)\nso when i download the files and unzip them i found this:\nimac-de-mr:files mrrm$ ls -ltr\ntotal 1236160\n-rw-r--r--  1 mrrm  staff    8388608 Jun  7  2012 config\n-rw-r--r--  1 mrrm  staff         33 Jun  7  2012 zImage.md5\n-rw-r--r--  1 mrrm  staff    2483788 Jun  7  2012 zImage\n-rw-r--r--  1 mrrm  staff         33 Jun  7  2012 initrd.md5\n-rw-r--r--  1 mrrm  staff    2793059 Jun  7  2012 initrd\n-rw-r--r--  1 mrrm  staff  619013120 Jun  7  2012 apps\n-rw-r--r--  1 mrrm  staff         33 Jun  7  2012 oem.md5\n-rw-r--r--  1 mrrm  staff     208896 Jun  7  2012 oem\n-rw-r--r--  1 mrrm  staff         33 Jun  7  2012 apps.md5\n-rw-r--r--  1 mrrm  staff         33 Apr 17  2013 config.md5\nimac-de-mr:files mrrm$\n\nso i tried to run config to configure the system for installation and that's what i have faced:\nimac-de-mr:files mrrm$ ./config\n-bash: ./config: Permission denied\nimac-de-mr:files mrrm$\nimac-de-mr:files mrrm$ sudo chmod +x config\nimac-de-mr:files mrrm$ ls -ltr\ntotal 1236160\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 mrrm  staff    8388608 Jun  7  2012 config\n-rw-r--r--  1 mrrm  staff         33 Jun  7  2012 zImage.md5\n-rw-r--r--  1 mrrm  staff    2483788 Jun  7  2012 zImage\n-rw-r--r--  1 mrrm  staff         33 Jun  7  2012 initrd.md5\n-rw-r--r--  1 mrrm  staff    2793059 Jun  7  2012 initrd\n-rw-r--r--  1 mrrm  staff  619013120 Jun  7  2012 apps\n-rw-r--r--  1 mrrm  staff         33 Jun  7  2012 oem.md5\n-rw-r--r--  1 mrrm  staff     208896 Jun  7  2012 oem\n-rw-r--r--  1 mrrm  staff         33 Jun  7  2012 apps.md5\n-rw-r--r--  1 mrrm  staff         33 Apr 17  2013 config.md5\nimac-de-mr:files mrrm$ ./config\n-bash: ./config: cannot execute binary file\nimac-de-mr:files mrrm$ chmod 575 config\nimac-de-mr:files mrrm$ ./config\n-bash: ./config: cannot execute binary file\nimac-de-mr:files mrrm$\n\nanyone knows what is the prolbem and how to solve it? \n\ni have a iMac 24-inch, Late 2006 - Mac OS X Lion 10.7.5 \n\n\n\n*\n\n*ix2-200-recovery-3.2.6.21659.zip\n\nA: I think you downloaded the firmware for the device.\nTry this link to the OS X download page for the IX2.\nOr this link to directly download the dmg.\n", "Q: Batch convert text to audio files, retaining file names I have a folder with hundreds of text files.

PLEASE HELP!]\n\nThis could be anything from a shared computer that has been cached on your system to a non-expired lease on your router.  \n\n\n*\n\n*To clear your mDNS  (Yosemite and Later):\nsudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder\n\n*To clear out the unexpired entry on your router, just log into your router, go to the DCHP Client Leases area, and delete the unknown computer.  Each router is different, but all have this functionality.  You will have to look up the settings for your particular router.\n\nI have a PC that is always connected to the network and Timecapsule.\n  But I don't recognize that unit name. And this unknown unit is not\n  always connected, just sometimes\n\nI am assuming that you have a wireless network and you allows friends/family to join the network to surf.  This may be a PC/Mac that belongs to someone you know, you just don't recognize their computer.\n\nI haven't seen that computer for a while now. Isn't the most likely\n  theory that it is someone that has broken in to my network?\n\nAgain, I am assuming that you have a wireless network - if it were wired (meaning no Wi-Fi) it would be really difficult to get into your network unless they had a physical connection.  \nIf this is the case, you can immediately address the issue by changing your network passphrase (password) to join the network.  Just log into your router and make the change (you will have to update your Wi-Fi settings on all your devices when you do that.)\nThe other option is to turn on MAC filtering (not Mac as in Apple Mac, but the media access control - mac - address) in you router.  What it will do is prevent anyone with an address you didn't specifically authorize from joining the network.  Keep in mind that this will become very labor intensive because every time you want to allow your friends/family who haven't joined the network yet, you will need to go into the router and add their MAC address, and that's after obtaining it (usually) manually from their device.  It's much more secure, than just a simple passphrase, but the trade off is convenience.\nIf you have more \"transient\" guests than regular family and friends, this is where you start looking at a guest network.  Most routers with guest network capability allow you to have another SSID (WiFI network name) a different passphrase (wireless password) and some rules like isolating the clients so they can't talk to your \"private network\" or each other; they also have the capability to limit your guest users by, time (only surfing at night), by site (no XXX) and even by bandwidth (limit streaming).  \nThis is all dependent on the router. \n\nA: This is not a security breach (if you're on a public network).\nThe \"shared\" section under the sidebar is Apple's Bonjour protocol that allows for detection of other computers that support Bonjour. In the case of a computer being shown in the sidebar, the computer is not connected until you click it and authenticate.\nI would assume you would be on a public network if you see computers you don't recognise showing up under \"shared\". As you can see in the image below, your computer will recognise other computers that support the Bonjour protocol that are on the network.\n\nIf you do not wish to see this sidebar section, open Finder preferences (⌘ Command+,) and uncheck \"Bonjour computers\" under \"Shared\".\n\nAdditionally, if you would like to avoid having your computer shown on others' Shared section(s), have a look at this question \"How do I disable Bonjour visibility after Yosemite install?\".\n\nA: If you think your Wi-Fi network has been compromised and you don't change your WPS pin, you may as well not bother changing your password.\n", "Q: Holding Down Control at Startup Manager (Boot Disk Selection) Screen I noticed that when I hold the control key at the screen where you select a boot disk (the screen obtained from holding down option at startup), the straight arrow below the selected boot disk turns into a circular arrow (similar to the Time Machine icon). I clicked this circular arrow thinking it would take me to the recovery partition, but the computer simply booted seemingly normally instead. What did the circular arrow do differently than clicking the regular, straight arrow?\n\nA: It makes it the main boot disk so it will continue to boot from that disk. It's equivalent to the Startup Disk preference pane in System Preferences, only done in a different place so you don't have to boot into OS X.\n", "Q: Mac Pro 2,1 updates and firmware question:will the firmware from the older work with the newer and vice versa?

Every solution I can find online uses tell app \"System Events\" to keystroke \"v\" using command down. However, I am running this script with a keyboard shortcut, so I may already be holding down keys when this command fires, which makes the paste fail because more keys are pressed than just cmd and v. I know that I can use delay to give myself time to release the keys, but that feels like a hack (and ideally the paste would be instantaneous).\nIs there a way to use AppleScript to paste without simulating the shortcut cmd-v?

In iOS Settings / Notifications, I can control whether alerts use vibration or sound or vibration-and-sound for Calendar, FaceTime, Mail, Messages, Phone, and Reminders apps. \nIn Clock App / Alarm / Edit or Add Alarm / Sound, I control whether alarm-clock alerts use vibration or sound or vibration-and-sound. \nBut I can't seem to have timer alerts (from Clock App / Timer) that are sound-only (no vibrate), without killing vibration for all apps. \nOr am I mistaken? \n\nA: You are not mistaken; a very odd oversight on the part of Apple. Note that you can turn off \"Vibrate on Silent\" in sound settings and flip the side switch put your phone on Silent, which will disable that vibration and still make the sound (I believe). \nAlso note that you can turn off vibration for alarms, but for some reason not for timers. My suggestion would be to download a different timer app from the app store if you want greater customizability.\n\nA: As of 2021 and iOS 14, the only way to achieve this seems to be to go to Settings > Sounds & Haptics, and turn off the \"Vibrate on Ring\" and/or \"Vibrate on Silent\".\n(This is sub-optimal since this effects the whole system and not only the Timer.)\n\nA: As mentioned in one of the other answers, Settings > Sounds & Haptics > Vibrate on Ring. Set this to off. However, if you keep the side flip switch set to Silent, the phone will still vibrate when the timer goes off. So if you want the timer to only make the sound and not vibrate when it goes off, simply ensure that the side switch is not on silent mode and turn off “vibrate on ring”.\n", "Q: How to create a Mac OS X Yosemite dmg bootable Installer Version?

But nothing I do is working. Can someone tell me what I'm doing wrong?\n\nA: It's System Events that handles the keystrokes.\nIn normal AppleScript the code would look like:\ntell application \"Safari\"\n    activate\n    delay 0.5\n    tell application \"System Events\"\n        key code 19 using command down\n    end tell\nend tell\n\nAs an osascript command line, it would be:\nosascript -e 'tell application \"Safari\" to activate' -e 'delay 0.5' -e 'tell application \"System Events\" to key code 19 using command down'\n\nThe osascript command line from above shown below as multiple lines for clarity:\nosascript -e 'tell application \"Safari\" to activate' \\\n          -e 'delay 0.5' \\\n          -e 'tell application \"System Events\" to key code 19 using command down'\n\nNotes: Before telling System Events to keystroke, the target of the keystroke must have focus. So first, Safari must be made the frontmost window with activate. You must then allow a moment for it to have focus before the keypress and that is done with delay 0.5 and the value of delay may need to be adjusted in seconds and or decimal fractions thereof. So once Safari is the frontmost window, then System Events can issue the keystrokes.\nThis of course assumes Safari is already open with at least one window having two tabs!\nThe keystroke used herein with Safari is a Safari 9 (El Capitan) keyboard shortcut as shown in: Safari 9 (El Capitan): Safari keyboard and other shortcuts\n\nSelect one of your first nine tabs      Command-1 to Command-9\n\n\nA: Use the key code 19 command, because the keystroke \"2\" command simulate the key code 84 (numeric keypad) instead of key code 19.\ntell application \"System Events\" to key code 19 using command down\n\nTo know the key code of some key, download this application --> https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/key-codes/id414568915?mt=12\n\nBut, you do not need GUI Scripting to select a tab in Safari, use this script\ntell application \"Safari\" to tell front window to set current tab to tab 2 -- this select the second tab\n\n", "Q: Iphone usage awareness Hi I´m an OT working in a high school in Iceland and we are doing a project on internet usage and how we use it in our lives.

I'm wondering, is it possible to not show what programs AppleScript opened and what it clicked and only show the result, (in my case it changes screen resolution)? That would result in faster script execution.\n\nA: Not directly. You would have to figure out what underlying preferences the UI is changing, and whether there was a way to edit them directly using AppleScript or terminal commands (such as defaults write -- see man defaults for details.)\nUnfortunately there is no canonical list of preferences that can be edited in this way, although you can find some here. There is also a website dedicated to hidden preference tweaks for OS X and Mac applications: defaults-write.com.\nHowever, for your particular case, I'm pretty sure there is no built-in way to change resolutions from the command line.

Basically thePath is set to /Applications/MyEpicApp.app/ with that extra / I don't want.What's the \"opposite\" of \"sometext\" & someVariable in AppleScript?Many thanks in advance, I appreaciate every piece of information.\n\nA: To have a portion of the string returned, the format would be:\nset StringVariable2 to (characters n through n of StringVariable1) as string\n\nn is the character number of the string starting at 1\nas string is important or otherwise you get a list of single characters returned\nJust make sure that whenever you parse any text, list or other item inside AppleScript to have text item delimiters at their default value (an empty list {}) unless you want to include those characters in the result as well.\nIn your example of removing the last character, it would be:\nset StringVariable2 to (characters 1 through ((length of StringVariable1) - 1) of StringVariable1) as string\n\n\nA: This statement uses AppleScript's negative-subscript feature to remove a trailing \"/\" if present:\nif the_path ends with \"/\" then set the_path to text 1 thru -2 of the_path\n\nThis does nothing (no error is generated) if the_path contains \"\".\n", "Q: Read geotagging data from iphone photos exif data I shoot photos with my iPhone and localization services are active.\nWhen I open a photo from my Mac Preview (tools > show inspector > exif) I can't see any geotagging data.\nBUT, when I open the image with my Mac Photos it correctly positions a pin on a map.\nSo, my question is: why I can't see geotagging data (GPS latitude and longitude) if it is clear they are written somewhere in the image? If they weren't, how could the map position the pin correctly?\nI tried various services online but I can't see any geodata either.\n\nA: If you are looking for an EXIF viewer on your Mac (which may show the location on a map or the actual GPS coordinates), I would suggest Image Exif Editor. If you look at the screenshots for this app, it clearly shows the GPS coordinates. If you are looking for something similar for your iPhone or iPad, I would recommend doing a search in the App Store using the search criteria \"EXIF.\"\n", "Q: My IDE runs tests slower when in a different workspace I am developing a server-side application using Java and OSX and quite often I have to run a rather large test suite to make sure everything is alright. I am using IntelliJ IDEA (Java-based IDE).\nWhen I use one workspace only, tests finish in about ~3 minutes no matter whether the IDE has focus or not. It just has to be in the same workspace.\nWhen I move the IDE to a different workspace (so I'd have 2 workspaces) or into fullscreen mode (which essentially creates a new workspace), test execution is ~100% slower (takes about 6 minutes).\nWhen I keep the focus in the second workspace for the whole execution time period, we're back to ~3 minutes.\nThis is really puzzling to me. I measured it using various number of workspaces and various number of applications per workspace, same results.\n\nClarification from the discussion from the comments, to avoid confusion:\n\nIf the focus in in the workspace with the IDE or full-screen IDE, it's fast. Once the focus is on a different workspace (so the IDE is either on a different workspace or in a full-screen mode (but with no focus)) then it is slower.\n\n\nA: It part of OS X itself to optimize the resources and to keep wise balance between foreground process and background tasks. Operating system devotes more resources to the active workspace, and to put less CPU processing capacity to the background tasks.\nBenefits are obvious:\n\n\n*\n\n*the higher responsiveness for user of the system in the overall for the foreground process;\n\n*and less CPU load (less heat is produced, CPU fan is quiet), lower impact on the battery life.\n\n\nIt should be clearly visible with Activity Monitor App, how much power system devotes to specific process.\n", "Q: what is the name and password for transfer server?

My Canon LIDE 600F scanner is old but still worked very well. When I upgraded to OS 10.11 my computer no longer recognized the scanner. Canon has officially stated that they are not making new drivers for this product, but I had a similar issue with my tablet not working and was able to find a solution on this site. Does anyone know of a workaround? \n\nA: VueScan might help. Honestly, you're better off buying a new AIO then trying to get these older machines working. You can also try deleting anything related to this Canon scanner that's on your Mac then checking if Preview will recognize it. I was reading here that some people had a limited amount of success doing that. \n\nA: I have used ScanVue on Mac OS X, both the 32 and 64 bit versions with no problems.  As far as the LiDE 600F (my scanner) is concerned, there is no 32 bit support on Mac OS anymore.  And the ScanVue developer cannot get access to the 64 bit drivers for this device (if they even exist).  It was always a good scanner and I would like to keep using it.  Unfortunately it is not possible unless Canon releases the drivers code and someone converts it to 64 bit.

Does FileVault 2 encrypt my free disk space as well as the deleted files that may linger on there? I ask this because I am selling my MacBook Pro and want to sell it but I'm not sure how to securely erase my free disk space. So I'm trying to encrypt my drive then reinstall Mac OS X over it (purposely forgetting my encryption key).\n\nA: Yes, FileVault 2 encrypts the entire drive, including free space and trash.\nTo securely delete the entire drive, I find this info here:\nWhile Apple removed secure-erase options from the Finder, Terminal commands still exist that can be used. The first is the classic “rm” file removal command, augmented with the “r” flags for recursive deletion of folders, and “P” to implement an overwrite of the removed files:\nrm -rP /path/to/file-or-folder\nFor more thorough secure deletion, you can use the “srm” command (for secure rm) along with similar options to recurse (r), force confirmation (f), and then be verbose to show information about files being removed (v). The second flag (-s) is important for the type of secure erase to perform:\nsrm -rfv -s /path/to/file-or-folder\nIn this command, -s will perform a single-pass erase, but you can use -m for a seven-pass erase, or -z for overwriting with zeros. If you do not use this second flag, then the command will perform a 35-pass erase.\nErasing free space on a drive\nIn some cases, you might want to run an overwrite routine on the free space of a given drive, but unfortunately Apple has also removed options to erase free space in the new version of Disk Utility, which may leave you wondering how to do this. Granted on SSD devices, secure-erase can impact the life span of the drive, but it may still be useful for HDD devices.\nTo do this in El Capitan, you can again use Terminal commands:\ndiskutil secureErase freespace LEVEL /Volumes/DRIVENAME\nIn this command, change LEVEL to a number of 0 through 4, where 0 is a single-pass of zeros, 1 is a single-pass of random numbers, 2 is a 7-pass erase, 3 is a 35-pass erase, and 4 is a 3-pass erase (note all non single-pass options may take a while to complete). Change DRIVENAME to the name of the mounted drive (encase the name in quotes if it contains punctuation or spaces), and then press Enter to run the command.\n", "Q: iOS 9 Photos in on-phone album in random order: how to rearrange or sort? I created a new album in my phone and added about 90 photos to it that I've taken over the past year -- all in-phone: no iTunes, no computer, no iPhoto... When I open that album, all the photos are in random order. Is there a way to sort the album by date? Or manually drag the photos to a new order?\n\nA: Sorting Manually In an album that you made (not a smart album like Time Lapses or Selfies), to move a photo around: head into that album, press Select in the top-right, hold down on the photo you'd like to move, and drag it to the place you'd like to move it to.\nSorting by date or name In the Photos app on Mac, go into an album, press \"View\" in the menubar, hover over Sort, and choose to either sort by date or by name. \nHope this helps!\n\nA: Select all pictures in the album using “select” and dragging across all pics. \nUse the “Add to” button at the bottom to add them all to a new album. \nThe pictures will be in chronological order. \nI hope this helps,\n\nA: @ymcready That really helped!\nThe easiest way to reorder your album is to Click \"Select\" then \"Select all\"\nSend to \"Album\"\n\"Create new Album\" and create a new Album with a slightly different name.\nNow the photos are in date order.

Searching for this in file name using Finder produces thousands of results which don't actually have * or \" in it.\nExample: \"fil*e.jpg\" or \"fil\"e.jpg\"\n\nA: With Finder as the active application, choose Find from the File menu. In the Searching \"This Mac\" window that brings up, select Kind is Document, then use + to add another condition with Name as the first item. If you choose begins with as the second item, you can find files whose names begin with a particular character, like space. The ends with condition won't find files with the names in your examples unless the filename suffix ends with the character of interest, but you can find a particular character, like a space, as the last character before the suffix if you choose contains and follow that character with .. For your file..jpg example you would use .. for the search text. This approach will find literal * characters in filenames, if you choose contains and use * for the search text.\nFinding such files with the find command (in Terminal) is straightforward if you quote special characters appropriately. For example,\nfind Downloads -name ' *' -ls\n\nreports all files in my Downloads directory which begin with a space,\nfind Downloads -name '*\\**' -ls\n\nreports all files in my Downloads directory with a * in its name,\nfind Downloads -name '*\\.\\.*' -ls\n\nreports all files in my Downloads directory with two consecutive . characters in its name, and\nfind Downloads -name '* .*' -ls\n\nreports all files with a space character immediately before the suffix. Finally,\nfind Downloads -name ' *' -ls -o -name '*\\**' -ls -o -name '*\\.\\.*' -ls -o -name '* .*' -ls\n\nreports all of those files in my Downloads directory. You can anchor the search elsewhere by replacing Downloads on the command line, and you can use other options to restrict the search further (-type f would ignore directories and symlinks).\n\nA: To illuminate and expand on Eirik's answer a bit: \nThe instructions he's provided you are essentially the same as you would use in the terminal, but with a few details hidden. \nMy guess is that you're seeking to clean-up file names, so this is something the terminal is really, very good for: precisely, in fact, why it's retained in any modern operating system at all. \nIf you're interested, let me know and I'll see about adding further details on what to type to (a) find all files matching your characteristics and (b) correcting their names (while keeping back-ups in case of concern) in a command you can paste into the terminal. :)\n", "Q: £# key binding changed after El Capitan update I have a Macbook Air (13-inch, Mid 2013) running OS X El Capitan. Prior to upgrading to 10.11.4 pressing SHIFT + 3 returned the £ (pound) sign and alt + 3 returned the # (hash) key. Since upgrading these have been reversed! Can anyone advise how to switch this back? Why has this happened?\n\nA: It seems that after upgrading my keyboard settings have been changed from US to UK.

I have notifications for messages configured to alert with a sound. Other apps are set to notify with sound as well. I do have Do Not Disturb enabled, but it is on a schedule (nights only). The mute switch on the side is turned off. Phone calls and other things make noise properly.\nWhen I receive a text and the phone is sleeping, I get no vibration, no banner popup, no sound. If I then press the power switch, I see the message notification on the screen, so I know the phone did receive the message.\nSame issue with the Apple watch I have paired to the phone. I see that the text arrived, but no alert.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: When your Apple Watch is connected to your phone notifications do not light up or make sound on your iPhone: this is unnecessary because you are getting the notification on your watch, so a phone vibrate/sound would be superfluous given that the notification is on your wrist. Thus, the issue is not with your iPhone (as it is not supposed to vibrate when it gets a notification with Watch connected). \nSo, why is your Apple Watch not vibrating?\nMake sure you have not turned off haptics.\nMake sure you are not in Silent Mode on your watch.\nTurn up the intensity of the haptic vibration alerts on your Apple Watch to ensure that you can feel it when it vibrates.\nIf you're still having an issue, try restarting your phone and watch  or unpair and repair your watch from your phone (this has helped many users solve this problem).\nIt's also possible that your Apple Watch's haptic (vibration) engine is broken or weak. Apple acknowledges that this can happen sometimes. Head to apple support at getsupport.apple.com, go to Apple Watch, and press the issue section \"Repairs and Physical Damage\". Then go to the issue \"Taptic Engine or haptic feedback is not working as expected,\" where you can mail in your Watch for repair or talk to Support on the phone about misfunctioning vibrations.\n", "Q: All my files and pictures got lost or deleted while installing the OS X El Capitan software All my files and pictures got lost or deleted while installing the OS X El Capitan software!

Specifically, I am interested in the DELL P2415Q.\nMy understanding is that I can connect 2 monitors with res 3840 x 2160 via the two thunderbolt ports, but only one can run at 60Hz, the other must run at 30Hz.\nAny help is appreciated!\nThanks!\n\nA: You can run one external display at 3840x2160@60Hz, or two external displays at 2560x1440@60Hz. There are two thunderbolt connectors, but only one thunderbolt controller, which only has the bandwidth of a single DP1.2 port. If you connect two UHD (3840x2160) displays, I'd expect both of them to run at 30Hz.\nContrary to my expectation, I have two UHD monitors running at              3840x2160@60 Hz connected to a Mid 2014 15\" Retina MacBook Pro (MacBookPro11,3). Both external displays are Samsung U28D590 with DP1.2 enabled. There are two separate ways of displaying the resolution and refresh rate (the monitor's own report, and System Preferences), and for both monitors, 3840x2160@60 Hz is reported by both methods. To see all of the details in System Preferences, hold Alt (Option) while changing Default for display to Scaled, then select Show low resolution modes. With my displays, it doesn't allow me to change Refresh Rate, but it displays as 60 Hz on both displays.\nOn a separate note, I recently discovered that the Apple Store claims that a 27\" Retina iMac can drive two external UHD displays at 60 Hz, or a single 5120x2880 display with dual inputs. When I first saw that I wondered whether the newest Retina iMac has a second Thunderbolt controller, but today's test on my Mid 2014 MacBook Pro suggests another possibility, a software improvement that somehow makes better use of the available bandwidth. I'm not convinced today's experiment would have had the same outcome a year ago, but I'm not quite tempted to install an older release and repeat the test (this MacBook Pro is running MacOS X 10.11.4 (15E65)). If anything, I'm more tempted to buy a Dell UP2715K to see if anything I already have can drive that.\nI have neither a DELL P2415Q nor a 13\" MacBook Pro to test, but based on today's experiment I'd say there's a good chance your Mac can drive two P2415Q displays at 3840x2160@60 Hz. Failing that, the second display can probably do 30 Hz with the HDMI port.\n", "Q: iPhone 3GS stuck in apple logo My friend owns an old iPhone 3GS(I know it's vintage) that entered a boot loop a couple of days after it was jailbroken. So how I tried tackling the problem was by performing a restore through iTunes(since it is the only way) but unfortunately that didn't work. I tried 5 different ipsw files and I even tried clicking on restore to allow iTunes to fetch the newest ipsw for me but still no luck. I tried using a different computer, still no luck. I even tried using an older version of iTunes since the iPhone 3GS's release but guess what, still no luck. Any ideas on how to tackle this problem and do you reckon the phone is soft bricked or hard bricked?\n\nA: Firm-Bricked I'm afraid.

It start flickering, changing colors, and vertical lines appeared in the middle of the screen.  All these are starting when I move the screen backwards, forward or when I am lightly pressing with the fingers the top of the screen.  This is also the only way to re-adjust to normal operations.\nAny recommendations?\n\nA: These symptoms all point in the same direction, there are some hardware issues. Perhaps a loose contact somewhere, moisture on the main board or display controller, etc. The fact that they happen or increase when moving the screen further back, all just add weight to the above analysis.\nYour best bet is to take your laptop to an Apple Store or Apple Service Provider and let them have a look. \n", "Q: Does Photos make its own copy of the photos that are imported to it? I have just migrated to OS X and have a lot of photos to import from my previous machine. The photos are already organised in a directory structure that I'm very happy with (i.e. 2016-05-04 Glasgow Trip).\nIs Photos making a copy of the photos in my existing directories, or is it copying them elsewhere?\nI'm thinking of disk space use (are the photos stored twice?), and depending on that answer, will the originals and the Photos versions get out of sync?\n\nA: There is a way to tell Photos to make a copy when importing or not.  In Photos --> Preferences check Copy items to the photo library. \nPhotos' default behavior is not to include original images in imports. It keeps links to them, so you can use Photos to edit or catalog them but still keep them where they are.\nIt reduce the size of Photos' library but if your goal is to clean up folders and disks with lots of photos on them, it can get confusing. To put everything actually in your Photos library, make sure to modify Photos' preferences to copy imported files to your Photos library. There's another important reason to do this if you plan to share those imported images on other devices: Only items copied to Photos' library will be uploaded to iCloud Photo Library. link\n\n", "Q: concerned that my app developer wants private information I have a freelancer creating an iOS app for my website.\nHe's asked for my apple developer account username, password and UDID.\nIs this legit? It sound like EXACTLY the sort of thing you're not supposed to do. However, though I'm competent in a website/db environment, apps and mobile dev is a sealed book to me (hence needing a freelancer). \nShould I provide this information?\n\nA: As an app developer with my own apps and client work on the store, I understand your concern, but there's nothing shady about this request. \nYour app is being made from a mixture of code files, images, and maybe some mp3s, etc. Once it's ready, your developer needs to package it up and upload it to iTunes Connect so Apple can review it for the store.\nThe way this works is that he or she (well, someone with the source code) needs to enter your credentials into a tool called Xcode in order to be able to upload the finished product, often called the \"binary.\" (Xcode is the development environment that iOS developers use. Uploading apps to Apple is a small feature, but that's generally how it's done.)\nIt's actually a little more interesting. The reason we usually don't like giving out our passwords is because we don't want other people to impersonate us. In this case, that's exactly what you want.\nTo understand this a little more deeply, let's talk about code signing for a minute. \nThere are two elements here. One is the signing certificate, which is for your security, and one is the \"provisioning profile\" which allows Apple to control apps from being widely distributed outside the App Store. \nWhen you or your developer creates your finished app, Xcode compiles the code, links it, and the copies the product and other resources into the final app bundle. \nThen, the bundle is \"signed\" with what's called a \"signing certificate\" which is created through the Apple Developer Portal. This reassures Apple that the app submission is coming from you and not someone else. \nA provisioning profile says what devices may install a given app. There are profiles for the App Store and profiles for development and profiles for enterprises to distribute to their employees. \nThe development profiles limit installation to a specific number of devices, and it does that by containing  a list of valid UDIDs - or device identifiers. \nSo Xcode has to get into your account, download your signing certificate and provisioning profile(s), and then upload the app. This is why your developer has to \"be\" you. \nThe truth is that for testing, your developer should be uploading to Apple and then using TestFlight to distribute the test version of the app but regardless, it's completely reasonable for a developer to have to access your iTunes Connect and/or Member Center account. \nYou can do this a few ways: \n\n\n*\n\n*You can give your developer your credentials, or\n\n*Invite them to be part of your team in iTunes Connect. That way, they can log in and do what they need to without having your password. \n\n*If your arrangement and your comfort level allow, the developer can send you the code and you can submit yourself. \nYou can remove them from your team or change your password when you are finished. \nIf you're really uncomfortable, offer to screen share with your developer and enter the passwords for them. It's not really the best option but could be a good compromise. \nBest of luck with your new app!\n", "Q: Working remotely with Mac I've Macbook Pro which I'm using now.

Since I want to keep having Mac System for some tasks I thought of buying Mac Mini and connecting to it remotely. I know it's done via VNC but was wondering how's the \"work\" with it?

Hi will resetting my 2011 Macbook Pro bring it back to the old version? I'm asking because i wish to run my pro tools but El Captian is considered \"too advanced\" for my software. Trying to save money and possibly reset my Mac. Does anyone know the answer to this? Thanks!\n\nA: If you Mac was shipped with OS X 10.6 or earlier, then the Mac came with an installation DVD. If your Mac was shipped with OS X 10.7 or later, then you can download that version from the internet. You will need to boot your Mac using Internet Recovery Mode and download the original shipped OS X version. \n\nEarly 2011 MacBook Pro models shipped with OS X 10.6 and the late 2011 MacBook Pro models came with OS X 10.7 installed.\n\nSnow Leopard OS 10.6 is now to old to be of any use for accessing the internet or running most current applications. OS X 10.7 is better, but not by much. Your best bet is to see what previous purchased versions of OS X are still available from the Apple Store. I believe, Yosemite OS X 10.10 can not be downloaded even if you previous purchased this version.\nIt is generally a good idea to backup any version of OS X you download, before installing or upgrading your operating system. What I mean by this is that you backup the .dmg file you downloaded. What people are learning is that you can not rely on Apple to allow you to download a previously purchased OS X version at a later date.\nIf you can download Mavericks OS X 10.9 or later, you can copy the installation files to a flash drive. You can boot from the flash drive and perform a clean install of OS X. The instruction are given at the web site Create a bootable installer for OS X.\n", "Q: Can't update my mail password on Macbook Air I recently changed my Gmail password, and as expected, the mail app can't log in to that account anymore. It says \"Login Failed\" in the top right. \nThe problem is, I can't figure out how to update the password so it works again. When I go to \"accounts\" in \"preferences\", there's literally no password field. It lists Description, Alias, Email Address, Full Name, Incoming Mail Server, User Name, Outgoing Mail Server, TLS Certificate. That's it.\nWhen I try to \"add account\" in the file menu, I type in my info and it of course says that account has already been added. \nIs there any way to just wipe out the account and start over? Or is there some other way to update the password?\nEdit: Added picture.\n\n\nA: It looks like you are trying to send out emails from your Gmail account using Apple's iCloud as SMTP server which is not correct. Here's what you can do: \nOpen Mail > Preferences > your Google account > in the dropdown menu select Outgoing Mail Server (SMTP) > Edit SMTP Server List\nEnsure that the settings match the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Outgoing Mail (SMTP) Server - Requires SSL/TLS: smtp.gmail.com\n\n*Port: 465 or 587\n\n*Requires SSL: Yes\n\n*Requires authentication: Yes\n\n*Full Name or Display Name: [your name]\n\n*Account Name or User Name: your full Gmail address (username@gmail.com). \n\n*Password: your Gmail password\n\n\nMore info on Google Support Docs: Change SMTP settings to check Gmail on other clients\n\nA: You should be able to reconfigure your password by doing that through System Preferences > Internet Accounts and select your Google account there. \nIf you recently changed your Google password, a Google login popup should appear.\n", "Q: OS X partially freezes I have a 27-inch, late 2012 iMac. After I upgraded to El Capitan the user interface (UI) partially freezes at apparently random moments. Parts of the UI continue to work (e.g., I can close applications by clicking on the red cross button). But, as soon as I try to use the menu bar or the dock, the system starts to get worse and more unresponsive.\nNone of the shortcuts to kill applications or restart the system work. So, in the end, even if parts of the system are still functioning, nothing can be done and I need to do a hard reboot.\nDoes anyone have an idea about the potential source of this issue? I had a look at the logging console, but as far as I can tell there is nothing apparently connected to the freeze.\nUPDATE\nI have run the Apple Hardware Test (by pressing D while booting the computer). I chose to run the extended test. After more than one hour of tests, everything seemed to be okay. I also ran the HD first aid test and there were no errors detected either.\n\nA: Last month I experienced something similar. I launched the Disk Utilities to test the hard drive, and the \"S.M.A.R.T. state\" warned me about critical failures. My guess: the system hanged up when it tried to reach files written on bad parts of the hard drive. I changed the hard drive.\n", "Q: What types of problems could lead to 10 logic board failures across 3 different laptops? In March 2012, I bought a new 15\" MacBook Pro. It required 3 logic board replacements over the next 13 months, leading Apple to replace the unit with a new 15\" MacBook Pro in April 2013. That computer required 6 logic board replacements (as well as various RAM, airport card, and fan replacements) over the next 20 months, leading Apple to replace that unit with yet another 15\" MacBook Pro (the one I have now; specs below) in December 2014. Despite my best hopes, this computer recently required its first-ever logic board (and hard drive) replacement last month. All problems were diagnosed and all repairs were performed at Apple stores.\nThe astounding frequency with which my laptops have required logic board replacements has naturally made me wonder what, if anything, I am doing to damage them. Some potentially relevant pieces of information:\n\n\n*\n\n*I keep multiple current backups of all my data, and whenever I get a new machine and/or hard drive replacement, I port all of my backed-up data to the new hard drive. Sometimes I've used Time Machine, sometimes Carbon Copy Cloner, sometimes manual drag-and-drop. In general, I install all applications anew from freshly downloaded .dmg/.iso files.\n\n*I use my laptop a LOT (I have a single machine for work + personal use), but I don't do anything too resource-intensive: very little gaming, no video editing, etc. The only exception is that I do some occasional statistical modeling in R, which always gets my fans going.\n\n*This may sound obvious, but just to head off a potential concern: I take care of my computer in the usual ways (always transport in a padded case, no liquid damage, etc.).\nMy question is: What factors could conceivably cause a string of logic board failures like this? To clarify, I am not asking anyone to solve my issue specifically; it's just that I don't even know what kinds of things to troubleshoot. (For example: As crazy as it sounds, is it possible that my files, which have – aside from me as the user – been the only constant across the three laptops, could somehow cause problems like this? Or is that outside the realm of possibility?) Any suggestions as to possible causes would be greatly appreciated.\nCurrent computer specs:\n\n\n*\n\n*15\" MBP (Retina, Mid-2014)\n\n*Processor: 2.8 GHz\n\n*Intel Core i7\n\n*Memory: 16 GB 1600 MHz DDR3\n\n*HDD: 1 TB SSD\n\n\nA: I don't believe anyone can give a definitive answer. I would guess the Apple Tech Support folks would have indicated something by this time.\nI personnaly have never heard of this level of repeated failures for a single person and/or device. But I have seen low levels of failures of Apple devices at a much lower, single instance level many times over the years. I have seen that I believe to be failure caused by \"power spikes\" on both the AC power ( very limited for Laptops ) and but more often thru other connected devices which the the like cause of the failure. Connections thru USB, ethernet - RJ45 cables can cause \"logic board failure\"/\"logic board replacement\" situations.\nI would suspect it is not your computer itself but the ecosystem of things your device is connecting to that a leading to this level of repeated failure that is hard to figure out ( apparently ).\nCan you paint the picture of your ecosystem of devices and home(s) of this device over the time period of failures?\n\nA: several additional questions which may direct some insight:\n\n\n*\n\n*do you know the reason for board failures? Were they graphics related (ie., video failure)?  some of the 2012 and 2013 MBP systems were known to have specific GPU chip failures, which Apple hid from public knowledge fairly well.. That COULD account for some of your board failures.\n\n\n2 have all these systems been used primarily at the same locations? Have you had power-related issues with other devices at these locations (fridge dying, dishwasher,etc)?  if yes, then you need to have a time-delayed power meter put on your power line, to see if you're getting a lot of fluctuation issues or brownouts going on...\n", "Q: How do I navigate the ribbon in Office for Mac 2016 with the keyboard? In Office in Windows, if you tap \"Alt\", letters appear all over the ribbon that illuminate how to navigate through it, switching tabs and hitting buttons to do anything that's on there.\n\nHow can I do that in Office 2016 for Mac?\nRelated question about Office 2011, has anything changed?\n\nA: As of Office 2016, Microsoft has not implemented the Alt-shortcuts for the ribbon.  However, there are several dozen other shortcuts that can be used on the Mac.  \nYou didn't ask for any specific shortcut so I won't list any here.  Also, there are so many that it would be impracticle to list them out.  I know we try to avoid 'link-only' answers but in this case there's no way around it.  Here are a few very comprehensive lists of all the Office shortcuts for Mac, including where you can use the excellent Accessibility features on the Mac:\n\n\n*\n\n*Alt key shortcuts on Office for Mac\n\n*Keyboard shortcuts in Excel for Mac.  These are very similar shortcuts for all Office apps, too.\n\n*Accessibility shortcuts in Excel for Mac\n\n*Select menu items, like Alt+letter for Word\n\nA: There is still no ribbon alt-shortcuts for Office for Mac, but there some alternative keyboard shortcuts:\n\n*\n\n*cmd+opt+R show/hide the ribbon\n\n\n*ctrl+F2 to open the system menu. Then use letter shortcuts to jump to menus and commands.\n\n\n*F6 will put focus on the ribbon. Unfortunately, you can't use letter shortcuts. Instead, you can use tab/shift+tab to navigate the ribbon. You can hold down tab to go faster. Then space to select the command. (This is not a very practical method, but it's possible.)\n\nA: I recently built a Mac app that enables these alt-shortcuts in Mac Excel. You can download it at https://www.acceleratorkeys.com.\nEdit: Noted that the original answer was a little short. I was trying to avoid being overly promotional. If you download the app, you'll find that Excel alt-key shortcuts work exactly as they do on Windows. It works on macOS Catalina, and across Office 2016, 2019 and 365.\n\n*\n\n*Open Accelerator Keys.\n\n*Open Excel.\n\n*Hit Alt and use the shortcuts.\n\nWe're being used by consultants, investment bankers, financial analysts, accountants etc. I built this using Catalina's new accessibility features to control Excel and re-create the alt-key shortcuts on Mac.\n", "Q: Changing the Finder icon for an external disk formatted as ExFat? I used this web page recipe - Create Your Own Custom Icons in OS X 10.7.5 or Later - for creating a .icns icon set containing a set of icons for an external disk that has been formatted with the ExFat file system.\nHowever, whatever I do, when I drag the .icns file on top of the drive, it just shows a .png dummy icon:\n\nIf I erase the drive and reformat it as OS X Journaled, then repeat the process, the icon is shown correctly:\n\nIs there a trick where I can reassign the icon also for an ExFat drive? I plan on using this drive both on a Windows machine and on my MacBook so keeping it as OS X Journaled isn't really an option. I know there are custom software for Windows so that I can read and write OS X file system disks but that's not an option either since I plan on connecting this drive to computers where I cannot really expect the owner to install custom software to use the disk.\nAnd the icon is not that important. It would just be a nice touch.\nWhat I've tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Basic .png file (that works on OS X Journaled formatted drive)\n\n*Full .icns file (that works on OS X Journaled formatted drive)\n\n\nSo can it be done? If so, how?\nThis is OS X El Capitan 10.11.4 and the drive is a WD My Passport Air 1TB if if matters.\n\nA: I do a \"Get Info\" on the drive. This brings up the info window. To add the icon, I drag and drop the .icns file on the image shown in the upper left corner of the window.\n\nWhen I refer to a \"drive\", what I really mean is a partition located on a physical or virtual drive. Since the partition is ExFAT formatted, the partition can also be referred to as a volume. \n\nMaybe your .icns file is no good. Maybe you should try one of mine. You can download the ones I use here. Or, you can try the free online tool I used to create these .icns files. Go to iconvert icons.\nWhen you drop the .icns file, a copy of this file is renamed .VolumeIcon.icns and placed in the root directory of the drive.

Also while the condensed example of your code is just that, I wouldn't use it without appropriate delay statements where applicable.\nIn the end, I'd choose to use the second block of code shown in this answer.\n\nA: My problem with @user3439894's answer above is that if Safari is open in a different space first then you may switch to it and open a new window there instead of in the current space.

(Unfortunately I'd rather not share the file here.)\n\nA: Your best bet is to report a bug in Apple Numbers using this form:\nhttp://www.apple.com/feedback/numbers.html\nBe sure to include the exact version of Numbers you're running as well as the complete crash log, or at least this part of the stack trace:\n  Thread 0 Crashed:: Dispatch queue: com.apple.main-thread\n0   com.apple.iWork.Numbers         0x000000010e4ccbca 0x10d523000 + 16423882\n1   com.apple.iWork.Numbers         0x000000010e3e11ab 0x10d523000 + 15458731\n2   com.apple.iWork.Numbers         0x000000010e3e1061 0x10d523000 + 15458401\n3   com.apple.iWork.Numbers         0x000000010e3ca64c 0x10d523000 + 15365708\n4   com.apple.iWork.Numbers         0x000000010dd6a9c7 0x10d523000 + 8681927\n5   com.apple.iWork.Numbers         0x000000010e3ca5bc 0x10d523000 + 15365564\n6   com.apple.iWork.Numbers         0x000000010dc0124d 0x10d523000 + 7201357\n7   com.apple.iWork.Numbers         0x000000010dbebd2b 0x10d523000 + 7114027\n8   com.apple.iWork.Numbers         0x000000010d5327ec 0x10d523000 + 63468\n\nApple will have the debug symbols that tells them, which specific functions are involved in the crash.\nThen you have to sit tight and wait until a new version of Numbers comes out where the bug is hopefully fixed. It is entirely likely that the bug won't be fixed, so don't get your hopes up too high.\nFixing the file yourself requires intimate knowledge of the Numbers file format, as it sounds like you might have a valid file that crashes Numbers - and not a corrupted file. It is very hard to give advice on how to fix the file yourself when you're not sharing the file in question.\n\nA: I was able to resolve this issue by opening the file in Numbers for iOS (synced via iCloud) and making some modifications. The updated version then opened correctly on my Mac.\n", "Q: How to Install pdfimages in El Capitan? I am reviewing the answer here about Extracting embedded images from a PDF.\nIt is not in Homebrew. \n\nHow can you install pdfimages in OS X El Capitan?\n\nA: Another command-line program that can extract bitmap images from PDF files is the command-line version of the Unarchiver app called 'unar'. (Doesn't need Homebrew or anything to install.) The command is simply\nunar filename.pdf\nhttp://unarchiver.c3.cx/commandline\n(The original GUI-based Unarchiver.app does this as well.)\n\nA: You can install via Homebrew with the following command:\nbrew install poppler\n\n", "Q: Unable to Run Update From 10.7 Lion to 10.11 El Capitan I recently reinstalled OS X, which with my MacBook Pro (2012 Model) meant that it grabbed Lion from internet recovery. It successfully installed, and I installed some updates, but when it comes to upgrading to Mavericks or El Capitan, the App Store crashes, the download shows up in the Launchpad screen, but never downloads or even tries to download, and I'm left wondering why. Every google search reveals something similar, but nothing exact.\nI've tried signing out and signing in again, I've tried enabling debug and clearing cookies and resetting the app store, I've even copied and deleted the com.appstore.plist and com.apple.appstore.plist.\nI'm at my wits end here. If not for the fact that I use OS X, I would wipe it and install Linux in it's stead. Any help would be appreciated.\nUPDATE:\nPer the request of J.C., I've run the download with the console open to get some diagnostic information.

I ended up testing both sticks to make sure that one of them worked, and now I've successfully installed Lion, and upgraded it to El Capitan. Thanks for the suggestions.\n", "Q: How To Trick WeChat Into to Thinking My iPhone Is An iPad? so I use a chatting app called WeChat and I have two phones. It only allows me to sign in on one phone at a time. But I can sign in on an iPad and a phone at the same time. It's an universal app, which means there is no iPad specific ipa. I like to know how I can put WeChat into a sandbox and makes it think my iPhone is an iPad. Thanks.\n\nA: The WeChat app can ask iOS whether it is running on an iPad or iPhone. It is not something you can set in Settings, or \"fake\" through the Messages settings as indicated elsewhere.\nThe only way to overcome this is with a jailbroken iPhone, where you can intercept the relevant method calls. In practice it is not possible to do so for an \"ordinary user\" without strong technical skills.\nTry contacting WeChat support to see if they have a work-around, or they might consider lifting the restriction in coming versions.\n\nA: Since I am not allowed to \"comment\" I will respond here. Look at your iPhone and iPad Settings for Messages/Send a Receive. You should see either phone numbers or/and email addresses or both. Perhaps you will see a categorical difference between the iPhone setting and that for the iPad. It may show you why WeChat sees the as two different types of \"things\". This is obviously just a guess. Good luck.\n", "Q: setup youtube-dl destination to ~/Downloads How do I setup youtube-dl to default download to ~/Downloads instead of the home folder?\n\nA: It doesn't download to your home, but to the current working directory. Change it before you want to download. If you're using bash, you might want to create a function in your .bashrc like this:\nfunction youtube-dl ()\n{\n    cd ~/Downloads/ && {\n        `which youtube-dl` \"$@\"\n        cd - > /dev/null\n    }\n}\n\nThis changes the working directory to the Downloads folder in your home, runs the original youtube-dl with the command line arguments you passed to the function and then changes the directory back.\nYou also may want to have a look at this: How do I run a program with a different working directory from current, from Linux shell? as this also applies to OS X.\n\nA: youtube-dl Config File\nTo set a default download location, create a youtube-dl configuration file at:\n~/.config/youtube-dl/config\n\nWithin this file enter the line:\n-o ~/Downloads/%(title)s-%(id)s.%(ext)s\n\nYou can create this file using the following two commands:\nmkdir -p ~/.config/youtube-dl/\necho \"-o ~/Downloads/%(title)s-%(id)s.%(ext)s\" > ~/.config/youtube-dl/config\n\nThe first command mkdir, creates the folders leading to the configuration file. The second command echo writes the output option into the file.\nOptions set within your configuration file are applied to every call to youtube-dl. Use the --ignore-config option to disable reading of the configuration file.\n\nA: There is no way of setting a default folder. Instead, you have to append the option -o every time.\n -o ~/Downloads/%(title)s-%(id)s.%(ext)s\n\n\n\n*\n\n*%(title)s-%(id)s.%(ext)s is the default filename format for every download.\n\n", "Q: Google Chrome on OSX will not open .desktop files created in Ubuntu I have recently collected & saved a large volume of internet links on my Ubuntu 14.04 machine that I wish to share with my other computer that runs OSX, but have come to realize that Google Chrome will not open these files on OSX as it does in Ubuntu.\nThe files are.desktopfiles. An example of the file's contents is as follows:\n[Desktop Entry]\nEncoding=UTF-8\nName=Link to Lifehacker Pack for Chrome: Our List of the Essential Extensions\nType=Link\nURL=http://lifehacker.com/\nIcon=text-html\n\nOSX does not know natively what to do with this file type, and prompts me to choose which application to use to open the files. If I choose to use Google Chrome it will simply display the contents of the file in a tab, but will not navigate to the url in the file. Opening the file with Firefox loads the URL fine in a new tab.\nHow can I get Google Chrome to open these files normally?\n\nA: My primary OS is OS X, however I do have a Linux Mint system I use and run into similar situations in which I want to do the same thing on both systems, and when it's not directly supported I have to find another way. In a case such as this, if there wasn't a Browser Extension for .desktop files, like in your other question about .url files, here is what I'd do.\nI'd convert the .desktop files to .webloc files and or .url files and use the Default Apps Preference Pane, RCDefaultApp by Rubicode, to change which application opens any given file extension.\nHere's a bash script, that I modified from a similar script I wrote years ago, which will create .webloc files and or .url files from .desktop files that have URLs in them.\n\n\n*\n\n*In a Terminal cd to the directory containing the .desktop files.\n\n*Issues the following commands:\ntouch d2wu\nopen d2wu\n\n*Copy and paste the code below into the opened d2wu file.\n\n#!/bin/bash\n\nclear\necho\necho \" Create .webloc/.url files from .desktop files.\"\necho \" ----------------------------------------------\"\necho \"              Choose File Type(s):\" \necho\necho \" [1] Create .webloc & .url files.\"\necho \" [2] Create only .webloc files.\"\necho \" [3] Create only .url files.\"\necho \" [Q] Quit.\"\necho\necho \" Press 1 to 3 or Q then press Enter...\"\n\nCreate_WEBLOC () {\n    for f in *.desktop; do\n        if [[ ! -f  ${f%.*}.webloc ]]; then\n            url=\"$(awk -F '=' '/^URL=/{print $2}' \"$f\")\"\n            if [[ ! -z $url ]]; then\ncat <<EOF >\"${f%.*}.webloc\"\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n    <key>URL</key>\n    <string>$url</string>\n</dict>\n</plist>\nEOF\n            else\n                echo \"  No URL found in $f file.\"\n            fi\n        fi\n    done\n }\n\nCreate_URL () {\n    for f in *.desktop; do\n        if [[ ! -f  ${f%.*}.url ]]; then\n            url=\"$(grep -e '^URL=' \"$f\")\"\n            if [[ ! -z $url ]]; then\n                printf \"[InternetShortcut]\\n${url}\\n\" > \"${f%.*}.url\"\n            else\n                echo \"  No URL found in $f file.\"\n            fi\n        fi\n    done\n }\n\nread  keypress\necho\n\ncase \"$keypress\" in\n    \"1\")\n        echo \"  Creating .webloc & .url files.\"\n        Create_WEBLOC\n        Create_URL\n    ;;\n    \"2\")\n        echo \"  Creating .webloc files.\"\n        Create_WEBLOC\n    ;;\n    \"3\")\n        echo \"  Creating .url files.\"\n        Create_URL\n    ;;\n    \"q\" | \"Q\")\n        echo \"  No files were created.\"\n    ;;\n    *)\n        echo \"  Pressing \\\"$keypress\\\" is not a valid choice...

Upon checking some hidden folders, I noticed that some files have Date Modified and Created property set to dates such as February 12 2016. I find that peculiar, because I installed OSX last week. How come I have folders on my computer that were modified even before they existed? Is this a leftover from Apple's team of engineers, meaning that they created this folder on that date?\n\nA: The original Install.framework used pax to deliver the payload. pax will attempt to preserve file metadata. pax was repackaged into a proprietary binary whose behavior mimics ditto which also preserves creation or birth time. I have files installed on my computer that have modification dates before my computer was manufactured.\n", "Q: Can a 21.5 inch iMac (non-Retina late 2015 - 2.8 Ghz, Intel Iris Pro graphics, model 16,2) drive two external displays? I'm currently running a Dell U2715H at its native resolution (2560 x 1440) via DisplayPort as an external display, and I'd like to add another at that same resolution. The Apple specs on this model don't say anything about two external displays. \nIs it possible to run two external displays with this model?\n\nA: Not according to EveryMac who are usually spot on with their info, including unsupported 'hacks', none of which are mentioned for this model.\n\nThis model can simultaneously support the internal display at full native resolution and up to 4096x2304 on an external display in both extended desktop (second workspace) and video mirroring (internal display duplicated on the external display) modes.\n\n\nA: I bit the bullet and bought another DisplayPort monitor (Dell U2414H), and sure enough, it works out of the box! I'm currently running a total of three displays - the iMac built in at 1920x1200, the 24\" Dell at 1920x1200, and the 27\" Dell at 2560x1440.\n\nA: Yes you can run 2 displays\nIf you have an iPad pro \niPad \niPad Air 1/2\nThere's an app called duet display\n11.99 GBP\nThen a free download from duetdisplay.com to install the app on this model of iMac\nTurn off iTunes backup to save space \nOpen the app on iMac\nConnect lightning or 30 pin from usb on iMac to iPad model\nOpen app on iPad model\nEt voila \n2 displays\nNot only do you have 2 displays but you also get lag free touch controls on your iOS device\nIt is very good\nCheck it out on your dell\nIt works with Windows too\nAll you need is an iPad lol\n\n", "Q: Import lcr file into iTunes I have a mp3 song in iTunes, on some 3rd party music player apps, they have the lyric displayed on the control center. I think that is done using an .lcr file. So my question is, is it possible to import an .lcr file into iTunes? If it is, how to do it?\nThanks\n\nA: As far as I know, iTunes doesn't support synced lyrics for music (they do for video.) If, however, you do want to import simply the raw lyrics, you could reformat the .lrc as plain lyrical text then add it under the \"Lyrics\" section of any given song. It might be possible to script it as well.\nFirst, let's understand the .lrc file format. In essence, it's just plaintext with extra tags for information. Since the tags are enclosed with brackets ([]) (with additional timestamping enclosed in angled brackets (<>) for the enhanced format), all you have to do is remove anything that fits these criteria. From there, it's trivial to add lyrics. Simply right click on the song in iTunes, click \"Get Info\", then \"Lyrics\", then paste them in.\nAlternatively, you could just Google the lyrics.\n", "Q: Can I install and run Safari 8 on OS X 10.11 El Capitan? I'm a developer supporting Safari 8 and 9 and would like to be able to run both on the same machine. I assume Safari 9 won't run on Yosemite. Is there a way to install Safari 8 on El Capitan?\n\nA: I'm a web developer as well with a need to test on older versions of Safari. Here's your best bet (caveat: this assumes you own VMware Fusion or a similar virtual machine emulator that can handle Mac OS).\nAssuming you've upgraded your Mac through previous versions of Mac OS (Yosemite, El Capitan, etc), you can still access those in the AppStore under \"Purchased.\" Find the OS you want and click the \"Download\" button.\nOnce it's done, check your /Applications folder for \"Install El Capitan\" (I forget the exact filename, but it begins with \"Install\"). With VMware Fusion, it's insanely easy to install this as a virtual machine. Open up Fusion and add a new machine, and choose \"Install from disc or image\" and simply drag/drop the Mac OS installer app onto the VMware import window.\nFollow the usual steps to install a virtual machine, make sure you allocate enough RAM, and you're good to go! By doing this, I was able to install El Capitan as a virtual OS on my Sierra machine, and test on Safari 9.\n\nA: While you can't install previous versions of Safari, you can emulate previous versions. From the Develop menu, select User Agent, and then Other.... \nFrom there, you can enter in a custom User Agent. For example, from the link in Tetsujin's above answer, you can replace the Safari agent thus:\nMozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_10_4) AppleWebKit/600.7.12 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/8.0.7 Safari/600.7.12\nYou should be able to emulate any prior version of Safari in this manner.\n", "Q: Does OS X or Xcode have applications to manage cheat sheet/commands list? I'm learning coding on OS X, as I'm a beginner, I have to read cheat sheets and I have bunch of files like that, Git commands, Ubuntu Server commands, Node.js modules command and so on.\nToday I saw my friend using Cloud9, it's Cloud IDE, it has a small area called \"Commands\" where he can search and read tiny description about it, also keyboard shortcut.\nI know that feature is so specific to Cloud9, but do we have similar functionality in some app on OS X, where I can create and store my usually cheatsheets? I don't need 100% exactly the same, just same same is ok.\n\n\nUpdate:\nI'm going to write my own app, I will let you know if I can archive anything.\n\n\nA: Try Dash. \n\nDash is an API Documentation Browser and Code Snippet Manager. Dash stores snippets of code and instantly searches offline documentation sets for 150+ APIs ... You can even generate your own docsets or request docsets to be included.\n\n\nA: I use CheatSheet which pops up a window if you press the Command key long enough and displays all currently available keyboard shortcuts.\n\n\nA: Perhaps the terminal command 'apropos' could be of use.\nFor example... 'apropos remote' should show commands for carrying out remote operations.\n\nA: For applications in OS X, you can search for functions and keyboard shortcuts through an application's \"Help\" menu. This is similar to Cloud9's commands menu.\n\n\nA: \ncheat allows you to create and view interactive cheatsheets on the command-line. It was designed to help remind *nix system administrators of options for commands that they use frequently, but not frequently enough to remember.\n\nhttps://github.com/chrisallenlane/cheat\nThey also have a wiki page listing similar projects. \n", "Q: iPhone text messages and iPads My husband and I have separate Apple ID accounts.  He has gotten old deleted text messages from my iPhone appearing on his iPad. I do not own an iPad; only a Macbook Pro computer.  My son had the same issue but at the time he did share an Apple ID with my husband.  I, however, have a separate Apple ID and have no idea why he would be getting deleted text messages from my iPhone appearing on his iPad.  Thoughts? We are on the same Verizon account and share Wi-Fi in the same house but that is all.  \nThank you for your help.\n\nA: I solved this by changing values under setting/messages/send receive.\nFor the iPhone enter the phone number then mark it with a check mark.\nFor the iPad enter your Apple ID.\nMy initial confusion stemmed from thinking that the Apple ID had to be used for both. It may have been that way long ago. I am not sure.\nGood luck.\n5/14/2016 Hi, your latest post says your husband has his phone number checked on his iPad. I have my Apple ID checked on my iPad. Also, I recommend deleting the old text messages as they might be giving false impressions. The original programmers are probably shocked that their strategy is being tested by families that have o many Apple devices!\n", "Q: Backing up just photo files from Photos library A similar question was asked before but doesn't go into the detail I am looking for-\nBacking up Photos library to external hard drive\nI would like to backup my Photos library but I don't want to use the .photoslibrary because there appears to be a bunch of meta material.

Can someone confirm if this is the case? As well, what would I be losing if I go this route?\n\nA: You'll have your original pictures without edits, if backing up just the \"Masters\" folder.\nFrom what I've seen, and depending on your configuration, this are some of the folders and educated guesses on what you will be losing:\n\n\n*\n\n*Database folder: Database info on Albums,  faces, persons, and sharing history, keywords, places\n\n*There seems to be information on your iPhoto database, probably there if you upgraded from it to Photos.app as I did\n\n*Previews (which may be there if you have iCloud Photo Library as I do)\n\n*Projects\n\n*Faces thumbnails\n\n*Thumbnails\n\n", "Q: How to install specific version of python on OS X I need to install python3.4 on my OS X. \nTried to do it with brew install python3 and now I have python 3.5.1.

For example to install 3.4 do sudo port install python34 There is also a python_select port that running it allows you to choose which version of python is run by /opt/bin/python. e,g, to select macports python 2.7 port select --set python  python27\nEach package manager needs to run as the only package manager otherwise it will be confused with unexpected different versions of libraries and executables on its paths.\nFrom comments the similar homebrew way is given in https://stackoverflow.com/a/4158763/151019 Short answer seems to be brew switch the equivalent to port_select\nPython version managers\nThe other way is install direct from python.org This will install a python into /usr/local/bin I think this installs a python and python3 executable.  The issue with Homebrew is that it assumes that things in /usr/local are installed by it and so brew doctor will report these python.org pythons and libraries as issues and as this question shows also the frameworks in /Library will be problematic.\nEDIT 8/2018 *** I would now suggest using conda either miniconda or anaconda. This is another package manager but based and mainly meant for python, it also gives the equivalent of python's virtual environments and pyenv (as per other answer) and so each project can be in a different python and different libraries (Macports only switches python version for all projects)\n", "Q: Google Chrome won't open URL files by double click I recently tried to open a URL link I saved onto my desktop by double clicking it, but it will not open correctly. If I DRAG & DROP the file into chrome works fine. \nThe code of the file is as follows:\n[InternetShortcut]\nURL=https://www.textnow.com/login\n\nthe file is saved with a \".url\" extension\nIf I double click on the file I'm prompted by finder to choose which application to open it with (Chrome is greyed out, but I choose 'All Applications' and then choose Chrome), it will then simply load a page in Chrome and display the code on the page, instead of opening the url specified in the code. \nrunning Version 50.0.2661.94 (64-bit) on OSX 10.9.5\n\nA: This is a known issue with Google Chrome. See:Chrome doesn't recognise .url files properly\nThe workaround it to use an Extension such as .URL Handler\nOnce installed you need to go to Chrome > Preferences... > Extensions (chrome://extensions/) and check the [✔] Allow access to file URLs check box.\n\n\nA: OK did some digging around. It turns out that Google Chrome's security model normally doesn't allow clicking on .url files to open them. \nThere is a Chrome extension that will allow this though so the solution is easy for OSX users.\n\nA: I don't know if this is relevant to Apple, but on Windows I changed the default app for .url from \"Google Chrome\" to \"Internet Browser\". It sort of makes sense as it seems like parsing the URL file is up to the OS then the browser opens the URL.\nMaybe Apple has a similar setting without resorting to browser add-ons.\nThis was the source that I tested in Windows 10: Chrome opening internet shortcuts as file not as website\n\nA: As URL files are just text files, I have solved this problem by attaching a script as handler to them, which reads the URL from the file and opens that URL with the default web browser. The following Nim script does this. I only tested it on my own operating system, but it should also work on Linux and macOS.\nYou need to compile it. Install Nim and then run nim compile urlhandler.nim on it. Then assign your URL files to the created executable.\n# urlhandler.nim\n\nimport os, system, re, browsers, strutils, strformat\n\n# You can change this. Use lowercase.\nlet URLEXTS = [\".url\", \".open\"]\n\n# ↑ I added the '.open' file type because on my OS it is not trivial to attach\n# new programs to the URL filetype in the default file explorer.

You could also just try deleting it and then in Terminal run the killall Dock command, then open Launchpad.  It should rebuild with only the currently installed apps.\n\nAnother thing to consider is maybe rebuilding the Launch Services Database may help.

I've managed pretty well for the past 6 or 7 years, and even when I DO get scratches I don't really mind. My latest iPhone, though, somehow got a pretty large scratch across the front (and a smaller one above that).\nThe thing is, I'm worried that I won't be able to trade it back in to T-mobile with a big ugly scratch on the screen. I know there's no way to \"fix\" a scratch, but I'm wondering if there are ways to lessen it--or at least make it look better. I've googled this several times and come up with things like toothpaste or vaseline, but I've also read that some of these things can make the screen worse.\nI've also read that screen protectors can make scratches look better (and I've already ordered one), but when I return it to T-mobile I'll probably have to take that off. \nNote: I've included a picture of the scratch(es) below, and the slight blurriness of my iPad camera does make the scratch look even worse. Just keep in mind that it's a big scratch, but not quite as deep and nasty as the picture suggests.\n\nA: Based on your included picture, I feel that it would be best to research whether T-Mobile accepts this type of return. On the other hand, I think that it would be better off if you just show it as it is, because if they find out that you have hidden a scratch, they might deduct cash. I think you should just trade it in as it is. Even so, http://www.t-mobile.com/cell-phone-trade-in.html states that your device's trade amount will be determined inside the store. So, just leave it as it is. \n\nA: The safest option is to try a screen protector and see if the adhesive covers the jagged scrapes like a bit of liquid would to avoid the diffraction and reflection from the scratch.\nLight rubbing by a finger with normal oils and then a light cleaning might be worth exploring.\nI personally would not try to buff it out at all unless imwas prepared with the time needed and for the cost of a paid glass swap repair. Did you get any accident coverage via purchasing method or AppleCare Plus?\nSome swaps are as low as $129 at Apple in the US.

I almost never use the speakers anyway, so this would make my life significantly easier while I wait for the new MacBooks to come out.\nTo clarify a bit: I've tried a bunch of solutions that attempt to repair the hardware, but I've given up on that. I'm just looking for a way to force the driver to send stuff to the jack regardless of what it thinks is happening.\n\nA: \nThere are a few things that could have happened to your headphone jack.\n\nYou may have a stuck headphone port switch, in which case you'll need to try to pop it out using one of these methods:\n\n\n*\n\n*Insert and remove your headphone plug a few times to reset the switch\n\n*Blow compressed air into the headphone port to clean it out\n\n*Gently insert a stick, like a cotton swab stripped of cotton or a toothpick, into the port and gently move it around to dislodge the switch\n\n\n\nAbove: The official headphone port switch diagram for a Mac computer.\nYour MacBook could also have trouble detecting the sound output device. Try option-clicking the Sound icon in the menu bar and slecting your headphones in the Output dropdown, or navigating to System Preferences > Sound > Output, and then selecting your headphones from the list.\nIf these tips don't work, it's a good idea to bring your MacBook into the Apple Store to have somebody look at it. \nIf you have AppleCare, this kind of thing should be covered by warranty. If not, you may have to fork over a bit of money. It's up to you to decide if that's worth it or not.\n\nIn conclusion, there isn't any built-in way to force the audio to always go to the headphone jack besides selecting them in System Preferences or from the menu bar.\n\n", "Q: Mac OS X El Capitan, Option key alone as keyboard shortcut I am using Macbook Air Mid2012 with El Captian 10.11.3 version.\nI have two languages installed (two input sources).

Do you know what it means?\nEdit: Mac OS X 10.11.4\n\nA: You need a bit of introduction to understand what SecTaskLoadEntitlements really is/does:\nAn application (.app) in OS X is really a folder containing a number of files, including the actual program, resources (graphics, sounds, etc) as well as system files such as plist files.\nOne of these plist files contains a descriptions of the application's entitlements. An entitlement is either that the application \"can do\" a certain thing, or that it has permission to do a certain thing.\nExamples on OS X would be for an app to have the permission to get read-only access to your Music folder, or that it is allowed to interact with Bluetooth devices, record from your microphone, etc.\nApplication on the OS X App Store are required to use entitlements in so that that they're required to be sandboxed, which is an entitlement in itself.\nIn order to make sure that entitlements cannot be changed or unrightfully gained, the entitlements are \"signed\". This means that the developer of the application uses a specific cryptographic key to \"sign\" the entitlements.\nOS X checks the signature when loading in new applications, and only if it is signed correctly will it load the entitlements and apply them to the program.\nYour error message means that the \"launchd\" program tried to load in the entitlements for an application, but it failed with error number 22. The number 22 means that an invalid argument (parameter) was given.\nThis completes the explanation of what SecTaskLoadEntitlements is.\nTo answer your main question you need to know what launchd is. Launchd in general is the first program started when you boot OS X - it has process identifier number 1. Its job is to start all the other programs necessary for booting your computer. It can also start programs based on time and events, such as for example hardware changes.\nTherefore the log messages you see are not necessarily linked to the problem you're having. Launchd is running continually no matter if you're playing the game or not. There is no indication that the log messages relate to your game as per the information you have given. It is thus unlikely that the problem with your game has anything to do with SecTaskLoadEntitlements.\nI would write a message to the Dread Out support to ask for a fix.\n", "Q: Uninstall default PHP on El Capitan My Mac has the default installation of PHP 5.5 at /usr/bin/php and I want to remove it the right way because I want to have PHP 7 instead of this.

I can't simply rm -rf /usr/bin/php because there's a lot of other components like php-cli, php-fpm, etc to be removed as well as apache and mysql.\n\nA: In my opinion, the right way is to set your path to prefer your installation of PHP.\n\n\n*\n\n*Apple restricts PHP so you can't delete it without bypassing the system integrity protection\n\n*Apple will update those files any time it pleases, so you're always needing to re-do whatever steps you take to modify the system\n\n*If you make a virtual environment like docker or just using correct paths to your installation, those are portable and don't need any sort of extra work.\n\n\nIf you really need to delete those files, you would boot to recovery HD and disable SIP. Then delete all files and associated libraries (with the potential to break Apple tools if you delete something the system actually runs at some point) and then re-enable SIP as desired.

Before it actually started installing (but after I had partitioned my disk), I realized I had not plugged in a USB (which apparently you are supposed to do). So I exited the Windows pre-installation program so that I could start afresh with a USB.\nI put in a USB and started up Boot Camp again. This time, however, it told me that I need to get rid of the partition. I tell it to do so, but it errors in this process! So now, I am left with 60GB of \"free space\" that I cannot reformat back into my main storage.\n\nAs you can see, there is no partition on the left side that I can remove. I simply have 60GB of \"Free space\" that I now cannot use. Please help!\n\nA: You can simply create a new partition using Disk Utility to regain those 60 GB for usage. Another possibily is to change the size of your existing partition, depending on its current file system.\n", "Q: How to install Image Capture by itself? I was googling how to mass delete photos from my iPhone and the consensus was to use Image Capture. However, I couldn't find that application on my Mac.

Always been satisfied.\nThat said, I recall reading a review that said there was a problem installing Bootcamp on the latest upgrades so I'd check with OWC tech support before ordering.\n\nA: I have ordered and installed the new SSD product from OWC for upgrading that specific model of MacBook Pro.\nThe ordering process was simple, payment went through without problems and the drive was delivered 2 days later even though I'm in Europe. The package came with great instructions and even the necessary screwdrivers.\nOn the other hand, the SSD is slower than the Apple supplied SSD and it simply doesn't support Bootcamp presently.\nYour only option for installing Windows is to run only Windows on the MacBook Pro - that works with the OWC SSD. You can ofcourse run OS X and a hypervisor such as VMware, VirtualBox or Parallels to run Windows on top of OS X.\nThere is currently no other brand (except Apple) supplying a compatible disk.\n", "Q: Unable to use finder My Finder on MBP has been giving me problems for a quite a few days and has become completely unusable. Once I start it, it opens fine but then I can't do anything. And it shows a scrambled view with images from background sometime (see below screenshot). Cliking on links on the side bar like Documents, Airdrop, etc has no effect. I have tried doing relaunch several times as well as restart. But no resolution.\nHas anyone faced such an issue before? I am afraid this might be a virus but I am not sure. \n\n\nA: This looks like a graphics card issue. I would recommend reseting your computer's PRAM. To do this follow the following steps.\n\n\n*\n\n*Power off your computer\n\n*Locate the command ⌘, P, and R keys.\n\n*Hold the power button until you hear the startup sound.\n\n*Immediately after you hear the startup sound, hold down the three keys from step 2 until your computer boots a second time.\nThis should resolve your problem. If your problem still persists you can download a 3rd party software such as https://gfx.io, which will force your mac to use it's alternate graphics card. Just install it and on your toolbar at the top of your screen click the \"i\" and change the setting from \n\"Dynamic Switching\" to \"Discrete Only.\" This will force your mac to use the NVIDIA card, and resolve your issue. I would recommend to try and reset your PRAM (Which has been changed to NVRAM, but is essentially the same thing), and only use my second solution if your graphics card rendering is still corrupted.\nEDIT - To stop finder from being unresponsive you can follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*power off your computer\n\n*hold shift immediately after you hear the startup sound. This will boot your computer into safe mode.\n\n*Open finder. The buttons should now work. Navigate through a few different directories.\n\n*Click the apple in the top left. Click restart and you should be able to use finder again.\nThe reason this may fix your problem is because when you boot into safe mode, it cleans and resets some things, which can fix your unresponsive finder issues.\nIf that doesn't work my last fix that I can think of without more information would be to open up the terminal application and type in this: \nsudo find / -name \".DS_Store\" -depth -exec rm {} \\;\nmake sure that you typed the capitalization right and it looks exactly like that, and press enter.\nType in your password. the letters won't show up when you type but don't worry the computer knows what you are typing. When you are done press enter. Reboot and it should be working again. If you want an explanation here it is. In every directory your Mac automatically creates a hidden file called .DS_Store. This file has information on it and after an update, or if something else happens, it can become corrupt or invalid. Executing the above command will remove these files so your Mac will create updated ones that work. \nWhile some of these solutions edit invisible files on your computer, it will not affect your computer in any way that you can see other than (Hopefully) fixing your problem.\n", "Q: How to Change USB Thumb icon using Terminal or Bash/other scripting language I'm looking for a method to change USB or External Drive Icon using bash or any other command line method. I know how to manually chnage them like this\nI am using El Capitan\n\nA: You need to copy the .icns file to the root folder of the volume. The new file needs to be named .VolumeIcon.icns. For example, if you are using a Bash shell, have the file vol_external.icns and destination /Volumes/MyStick, then below would be the command.\ncp  vol_external.icns  /Volumes/MyStick/.VolumeIcon.icns\n\n\nA word of warning: Once you assign an icon to a volume,  changing this icon is very difficult. I feel there must be a bug somewhere in OS X. However, deleting the icon does seem to work.\n\nTo get a directory listing for this copied file, you may need to include the -a option in the ls command line. For example, the command\nls  /Volumes/MyStick\n\nwill not display the file .VolumeIcon.icns, but the command\nls  -a  /Volumes/MyStick\n\nwill show the file.\n\nNote: Normally, files starting with a . do not appear in the Finder application.\n\n\nA: In my case, simply copying was insufficient.

The $PATH passed to the proc_check.sh shell script is only:\n/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin\n\nSo, any program that is called in the script that is not in the above $PATH or includes it's fully qualified pathname is not running when called by launchd.\nTo fix this, either use the fully qualified pathname for all executables called within the script, that are not in the above $PATH, or add a PATH=... statement after the shebang, where ... is the actual output of, echo $PATH in Terminal, e.g.:\n#!/bin/bash\nPATH=/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/opt/X11/bin\n\nNote: The $PATH above is what's outputted by echo $PATH on my system and may well be different on yours.\n\nA: After getting this far, it had to be some issue with mail being invoked by launchd, so I searched on that and I found this which referenced this. It was the .plist file in that it did not include the AbandonProcessGroup key which would allow the mail process to live long enough to work. Adding\n<key>AbandonProcessGroup</key>\n<true/>\n\nmade it work.\nI was setting myself up for this in that I was using a .plist generated by a 3rd party app to \"save time\". Such apps are not always complete or accurate in the .plist files they produce, apparently.\nThanks to @user3439894 & @Mark for their help.\n", "Q: Clicking on external link opens a tab in wrong Chrome window The setup\n\n\n*\n\n*2 monitors are connected to my Mac Pro 4.1 running El Capitan 10.11.4\n\n*Monitor 1 is a desktop monitor\n\n*Monitor 2 is a TV\n\n*My default browser is set to Chrome (Version 46.0.2490.71 (64-bit))\n\n\n\nHow I use the computer\nI usually have multiple Chrome windows opened at the same time.

I use this drive in my Windows 10 laptop before this and both partition are GPT type.\nI already format first partition and it's now empty. The second partition contains lots of important data and I don't want to format it because I don't have backup of them.\nWhen I connect the drive with my Mac (I'm running on OSX 10.11.4), I can see that the total drive size is 500GB like below:\n\nBut, only first partition appeared and I can't see the second partition (GPT) one.\n\nWhat should I do now to read and access that GPT partition? Please help.\nUPDATE\nRunning diskutil list command from terminal give me this. I believe that Microsoft Reserved is the partition that I'm looking for:\n\n\nA: The first step in situations like this is to use the mouse to select each visible part of the drive on the left and use the info button.\nIt will show you things that the command tool diskutil will if you open terminal and use it:\ndiskutil list\n\nThat will read the volume partition map and give you details on each partition with less detail than the info pane in disk utility. Once you know if the other partitions are NTFS or ext3 or another format, you can look for software or drivers to read that content. Worst case you have to pay for a commercial solution if you can't change the disk to a format that OS X reads (or writes if that is your requirement) natively.\nSince Apple supports a wide variety of filesystems in read only mode, the most logical conclusion would be your drive isn't following standards or is damaged slightly and would mount properly once repaired or reformatted to standards. It's not uncommon for vendors to implement slight variations to filesystems that break compatibility on other OS.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/FileManagement/Conceptual/FileSystemProgrammingGuide/FileSystemDetails/FileSystemDetails.html\n\nA: The problem that you are experiencing is that OS X cannot natively read/write the NTFS partition.\nMy suggestion is to copy that data to another drive/partition, format the partition to something that OS X can read like ExFAT (if you want OS X and Windows compatibility), then copy your data back.\nTo read the NTFS partition so you can copy the files, you need to enable it.  Here are the steps\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure your NTFS drive has a single word name.  Using your example, rename it from \"Untitled\" to \"UntitledNT\" or something that can help you distinguish which partition you are working with.\n\n*Using Terminal, edit the /etc/fstab file by issuing the following command:\nsudo nano /etc/fstab\n\n3.  Add the following line and be certain to change \"UntitledNT\" to whatever you changed it to.\nLABEL=UntitledNT none ntfs rw,auto,nobrowse \n\nPress Ctrl O to save the file, then press Ctrl X to exit.\n\n\n*Eject your drive and re-attach it.  It won't show up in Finder, so you will have to manually navigate to it.  In Terminal, just type open /Volumes and a finder window will open with a directory to \"UntitledNT\"\n\n*You can copy your files now (you can't write)\n\n*Copy your files over \nTo Mount Your NTFS Partition via Terminal\nTaking your output from disktuil list it shows that the identifier for your NTFS partition is /dev/disk3s2.\nFirst, make a directory in your /Volumes folder:\nmkdir /Volumes/ntfsdisk\n\nNext, mount the drive\nsudo mount -t ntfs /dev/disk3s2 /Volumes/ntfsdisk\n\nYou should be able to access your data.

Recently I had the feeling that things were running slowly (and I probably have been ignoring it up until now), so I downloaded and ran Blacmagicdesign's Disk Speed Test 2.2.2\nThis speed test gave me a read and write speed of about 50 MB/s which my gut feeling is saying is not very good.\nI also ran the Disk Utility's First Aid and the drive passed all the tests applied by that utility.  So:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is this an unreasonable read/write speed?\n\n*Would it be due to the hard drive being less than 10% full?\n\n*Something else that I am missing?\n\n\nAfter the storm\nI just replaced the hard drive with a Samsung 850 EVO 1TB SSD.  The boot time halved, Apps open almost immediately, the Disk Speed Test pegs at 480 MB/s and the Negotiated link speed is 6 GB/s.  \nThats all good, but the weirdest things is how quiet it sounds now!\n\nA: The first thing you want to do is reference the drive specs to see what it is rated in terms of data transfer speed.\nAccording to C/Net, it has an external data transfer rate of 300MBs (it's a SATA drive, so this is expected)\n\nSo, if you are getting a drive speed rating of 50MB/s, things are definitely slow.  5400 RPM is also quite slow to begin with.\nYour best option is to upgrade your drive to an SSD.  I have written a post that addresses this very topic.  Have a look here: My Mac is getting really slow, what should I do?\n\nA: Generally, MacBook Pro models use 2.5 inch drives and iMac models use 3.5 inch drives. The 3.5 Hard Disk Drives (HDD) generally rotate a 5400 rpm, where as 3.5 inch HDDs rotate at 7200 rpm. I often thought the slower speed was to save laptop power, but this is just my guess.  \nWhat really matters is the speed data is transferred to/from the drive. Take my 2007 iMac, if I select \"About this Mac\" from the menu bar and then click on the \"System Report...\" button in the pop up window, I can get information regarding the transfer rate. \n\nFrom the above image, I have repeated the important information below.\n\n\n*\n\n*Link Speed:            3 Gigabit/second\n\n*Negotiated Link Speed: 3 Gigabit/second\n\n*Model:                 ST1000DM003-1CH162\n\n\nThe \"Link Speed\" is the fastest transfer rate offered by the hardware on your logic board. The common most speeds are 1.5, 3 and 6 Gb/sec. The \"Negotiated Link Speed\" is the actual transfer speed of the data between the logic board and the drive. My Mac is running at the maximum speed offered by the logic board hardware. Finally, there is the drive itself. The original drive was replaced with a 1 TB Seagate drive. This model drive is capable of a 6 Gb/sec transfer rate, but is running at at 3 GB/sec because my antiquated logic board.\nI do not know the \"Link Speed\" of your logic board, but your drive has a maximum transfer rate of 3 Gb/sec. \n\nNote: For the same transfer rate, A Solid State Drive (SSD) will be faster than a HDD. With HDD there is a latency in waiting for the drive to spin to there correct position before a read/write of data can be preformed.\n\n", "Q: How to clear list of servers \"Choose a mac\" list in OS X Server App How can I clear the \"Choose a Mac\" list?

I saw that on my iPhone under iCloud settings Mail was turned off but under iCloud Drive it's turned on and Google Drive is turned on as well (didn't mess with those settings before). Are my Emails from GMail and Google Drive files backed up by iCloud? That would make no sense and only steal my space.\n\nA: Sorta–but no.\nThere are actually three different things we're talking about here.\n\n\n*\n\n*iCloud mail\n\n*Storage of attachments in iCloud\n\n*Backup\n\n\nEach of these items are very distinct, but all pull from the same storage pool (your 5GB default.)\nLet's go over each.\nThe first is iCloud mail. This is an email service effectively equivalent to any other, provided by Apple. Depending on when you registered for it (if at all), you'll have either an @icloud.com, @me.com, or @mac.com address. If you're not registered (which is what it appears is the case with your account), you simply don't have one. It's by no means necessary.\nThe second storage in iCloud. There are two versions of this: the first is temporary storage of large attachments in iCloud. This is a fairly new feature: you may notice if sending an attachment over a certain size that it will ask if you'd like to store it in iCloud instead. The second is just saving attachments you receive, which is pretty self explanatory In essence, this is no different from any other app using iCloud for storage.\nThe third and final is backup–or rather lack thereof. Backups (at least of iOS devices to iCloud) do not store mail data, as it has to exist somewhere else in the cloud–be it on Apple, Google, or whoever's servers. \nIn summary, you aren't using any space for mail in iCloud (unless you told it to, and you can always turn it off.)\n", "Q: Download apps to 1st gen ipad I bought my Mom a 1st gen for Mothers day.  But now I cannot get any apps! \nAny help would be appreciated. I have no idea where to start.\n\nA: A first-generation iPad only supports iOS 5. That means it only runs apps that still support iOS 5, which are few and far between.\nTo download these apps, head to the App Store (the blue icon on the iPad's home screen), and you'll be able to download apps. Either they'll download or give you an error that they're not supported, in which case you can't download them.\n", "Q: Create install media - lion -command not found I am trying to create a bootable usb drive in order to rebuild my sons old imac.

What am I missing?\n\nA: Mac OS X Lion didn't come with the built-in ability to create a USB installer since a small USB flash drive installer came with Mac's that shipped with Mac OS X Lion and was also sold by Apple on a small USB flash drive.  It was also downloadable through the App Store.  It was the first release of Mac OS X to not come on optical media.\nTo create a USB Installer, from the downloaded Install Mac OS X Lion application bundle, you'll need to use a program like DiskMaker X (formerly Lion DiskMaker) \nSurly because Apple sold the Mac OS X Lion USB Installer for ~$79 USD they weren't going to make it easy for users to usurp buying the product vs. making it themselves.  That changed with OS X Mavericks, being the first OS X release to include a built-in way to create a USB Installer.\nTo create a USB Installer for OS X Mavericks and later, have a look at: Create a bootable installer for OS X\n", "Q: Sending SMS from iPhone I have an iPhone but my friend does not.

The Intel HD Graphics 4000 1024 MB integrated in my MacBook Pro (Mid 2012) does not meet exactly my expectations. Recently Nvidia announced the GTX 1080 for a decent prize.\nAccording to come websites it is possible to connect an external GPU to a MacBook via Thunderbolt. I would like to know if somebody already tested this option and if there is some difficulties/problems one should be aware of.\nIn addition I saw that there are some website that already sell a chassis with with a GPU. The chassis is quite expensive... Is a chassis really necessary or the GPU could be connected directly to the MacBook without any additional component (Thunderbold cable excluded, obviously)?\n\nA: Attaching an external GPU to a MacBook Pro via Thunderbolt has been tested and tried, yes. The specific GTX 1080 has not ofcourse, as it hasn't been released yet.\nYou will need the chassis. There's no way to connect the GPU over Thunderbolt without the chassis (or similar device - it doesn't actually have to be a metal box, but the electronics needs to be there).\n", "Q: How to delay MacBook Pro sleeping I need to know how to delay the automatic sleep on the Macbook Pro. It sleeps too early.\nIf I leave it for one minute it sleeps. I tried the view options but it didn't work.\n\nA: Look in System Preferences -> Energy Saver. You may need an admin password to change settings.\n\nA: You can keep your Mac on forever when you need to without digging into settings if you download the Mac app Caffeine.\nAlternatively, you can use OS X's built-in command line tool caffeinate to keep your Mac awake for longer periods.\n\nA: I have been using a tool called \"Should I Sleep\" for several years now. It sits in your menu bar and allows you to set all kinds of 'sensors' to determine if or not the computer is 'allowed to go to sleep'. \nExamples of these sensors are \"is there sound?\" \"Is there a person sitting at the computer?\" \"Has the download already finished?\" Etc. I believe some sensors are free, others are not. \nHave a look at the App Store for this application. \nNote: I'm just a user, not the developer, and I gain in no way by you opting for this software.

Initially tried disabling csrutils in Mac OS recovery mode, and also made sure to check \"Download updates while installing\" during the Ubuntu installation (I had to click \"back\" after installing the wifi drivers on that screen in order to do this, since the two checkboxes are on the same screen in the ubuntu installation wizard). I also tried installing with and without REfind.\nWith the variations above, I tried four times and every time I got the dreaded \"grub failed to install to target\" message, and the installation crashed.\nHowever, on the fifth try, I did one thing different: I made a swap partition during the partitioning part of the ubuntu installation wizard (previously, I had chosen to continue without a swap partition, and just ignored the warning message I got. As for the rest, I had csrutils back on because I didn't think that caused any troubles, but still made sure to check \"download updates while installing\". This time it worked, and there was no grub failure message. For the rest of the installation, I followed the instructions here for installing without REfind.\nBy the way, if you install without REfind according to the instructions linked, ubuntu will be set to the default boot OS. To boot into Mac OS, you would need to hold option after powering on/restarting, then select it. To change the order, you cannot use the Startup Disk system preferences, since you won't see Ubuntu as an item. However, there's a very easy trick to set the default: hold option after boot, then when you get to the screen with the Mac Boot where you can select either Mac HD or EFI Boot (ubuntu), hold CTRL and the up arrow below Mac HD will turn into a circular arrow. Click on that, and Mac will be set as the default!\n", "Q: Charge my Mac via USB I have a portable power bank and I can charge devices via USB on it. Is there an adapter to change a 3 prong charger to a USB, so I can plug my Mac into my power bank? A Mac air charger that can plug into a USB port would work as well.\n\nA: Most MacBook use MagSafe charging which doesn't operate on the same voltage as USB - so the vast majority of battery banks that charge anything USB won't work. There are some inverters that would power the adapter using 120 or 240 VAC but those are quite large.\nOnly the new MacBook with USB-C connector is low power enough to charge over the new power delivery specification for USB 3.1 that generally is supported along with the change to USB-C connector. Any charging bank would need increased power than what is used to charge most any mobile devices made in 2015 and earlier.\n\nA: Standard USB ports can not handle the load of power that a Macbook Air/Pro draws. So no, it is not advisable even if you could find an adapter. (Note that if you have the new ultrathin Macbook—not the Air or Pro—you can use a USB-C to USB2 cable to charge it from a power bank.) \nYou can get a special power bank (like this one) that can charge your Macbook Air via Magsafe.\n", "Q: How to access Pages document when I forgot the password for it? Sometimes I set up a password for my Pages document, and I forget it. Is there a way to access the document without a password or recover password back anyway?\n\nA: No. What would be the purpose of a password if you didn't need it to open the document.\nNext time, write down the password if you forget easily.\n\nA: I'm having the same problem. As far as I know there is absolutely no way to open a locked document without the password. I have searched many different websites and the all came up with this same answer.  And I hope for your sake that those documents aren't to important. But don't give up and delete your documents just yet, because maybe if you look in the right places you'll find a way. I recommend that next time you lock a document you add a hint you know will help you.(I didn't do that and that's where my problem started.) I'll come back and let you know if I find a better answer. I hope this helped!\n\nA: *\n\n*Open a new document\n\n*Go to original document\n\n*Go to edit and select all\n\n*They go back to the new document and paste\n\n\nNow, write down the new password or make it something that you can remember\nHope that works for you.\n\nA: Pages, as any iWork documents with password protection, are AES-128 encrypted. As of today, there is no easy way around it.\nThe following describes the hard way: Attacking the password with brute force.

For a dictionary attack, try the rockyou.txt dictionary of commonly used passwords:\nwget https://www.scrapmaker.com/data/wordlists/dictionaries/rockyou.txt\n\n./john/src/john --wordlist='rockyou.txt' encryped.hash\n\nJohn the Ripper will work on all available threads to try out all passwords. If you know anything about the password, you can run JtR with a mask.\nFor example: You know that the PW starts with an uppercase letter and continues with 5 lowercase letters:\n./john/src/john --mask='?u?l?l?l?l?l' encrypted.hash\n\nFor more brute-force mechanisms and techniques, please check the documentation\nPlease note that the longer the password is, the time to brute-force it grows by an order of magnitude.

I've realized today that my iMac is sending/receiving(mostly send) some anonymous data over the internet(almost 500MB today), I checked with Little Snitch and found these addresses are consuming data on my Mac:\np24-caldav-current.edge.icloud.apple-dns.net,\n p24-caldav.icloud.com,\n p24-ckdatabase-current.edge.icloud.apple-dns.net,\n p24-ckdatabase.icloud.com,\n p24-contacts-current.edge.icloud.apple-dns.net,\n p24-contacts.icloud.com, \n p24-escrowproxy-current.edge.icloud.apple-dns.net,\n p24-escrowproxy.icloud.com, \n p24-keyvalueservice-current.edge.icloud.apple-dns.net,\n p24-keyvalueservice.icloud.com\nAs soon as i blocked them out, My mac stopped eating traffic!\nWhat are these and why would apple exchange such amount of data ?\n\nA: I see this question is a year old, but I was just researching the same thing and thought I'd share my answer.  I have used Little Snitch for years, but only began seeing the connection alerts referred to by OP after I turned on iCloud Sync in System Preferences.  If you have this option selected, I can confirm that this traffic can be attributed to your files being backed up to iCloud Drive.  \nIf you always use the same network configuration and/or are not overly conscious about security and privacy, allowing and whitelisting those hosts and/or IP addresses is perfectly fine.  But if you're running software like Little Snitch, then one might infer that you are at least more conscious about your anonymity and security than the average user.  If you are reading this and nodding, then I would suggest creating a new \"Profile\" in Little Snitch.  Furthermore, if you have access to a VPN or proxy, activate the \"APS\" (Automatic Profile-Switching) feature. Profiles can be toggled manually, or automatically (when you switch networks), whenever one wishes to regulate network connections more strictly.  This is useful for many reasons.  Some may simply wish to cut down on bandwidth-hungry, resource-intensive background processes.  Others may wish to anonymise themselves from censors, ISPs, advertisers, data-miners, governments, or other parties that could tie you to your internet use by logging your traffic, IP and geolocation.\nUntil last year, I might have doubted that Apple's logs of iCloud, iTunes, and App Store traffic would be employed to tie users to unrelated internet traffic.  But these logs, willingly provided by Apple, proved instrumental to the arrest of alleged \"Kickass Torrents\" domain owner [1] [2].  So now whenever I am torrenting, I am have Little Snitch switch to a new profile specifically for my VPN.  For more details, here are a few ideas.\n", "Q: Second screen mirror one desktop While I am using multiple desktops on my Mac, I would like to mirror one of these desktops on a second monitor. \nThis monitor would keep mirroring this desktop while I could switch between all of my desktops with my main monitor.\nAny ideas on how to make this happen?\nI am using an iPad as a second monitor if that might be important.\n\nA: Welcome to Ask Different!\nI am assuming you are using an app such as Duet Display or Air Display for this purpose. It sounds like you are attempting to extend your desktop, rather than mirror a desktop. You will need to go to System Preferences -> Display -> Arrangement. From there, you can shoes to extend the Desktop. \nFollowing these steps, you will be able to have one or more windows open on your iPad screen, and several desktops on your Mac screen as well.\n", "Q: OpenSSL encryption method doesn't work on El Capitan The following file encryption method works on OS X Yosemite:  \nEncrypt: openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -salt -in file.zip -out file.zip.enc\nDecrypt: openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -d -in file.zip.enc -out file.zip\nHowever, when on OS X El Capitan I get this error:\nunknown option '-aes-256-cbc -in file.enc'\n\nAny solutions?\n\nA: You likely have a shell quoting problem.

Back when I used the Mail app on Leopard and Snow Leopard, it never seemed to tell the Gmail server that to mark as read the messages that I read. This had the annoying effect of requiring me to go to my web browser and mark everything as read there. \nNeedless to say, I didn't use it much since I would have to go to my web browser to mark it as read anyway.\nDoes the Mail app in El Captain have this problem? (I switched back to Windows a while back)\nEDIT: I want to clarify that I want Mail to automatically mark messages as read as I read them, without having to do anything else.

Original post below.\nThe problem:\nIf I take a screen shot on my Retina Macbook, with a display resolution of 2560x1600, the saved file cannot be opened on the same machine at resolution 2560x1600, but needs to be rescaled to 50% (at least in Preview and XnViewMP).\nMy questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Why is this the case? Why can't I open a screen shot at 100% on the display the screen shot was taken of?\n\n*Is there a real solution for this? By \"real solution\" I mean, not a workaround that simply rescales the image to 50%, and as a result, will make it look somewhat blurry?\n\n\n(Old version)\nI'm aware that this problem -- of screen shots taken on a Retina Macbook looking bad due to some \"resolution mismatch\" -- is a known problem. It's been covered for example here. \nHowever, I'm trying to figure out what exactly is going on, because right now I don't even understand what causes this problem:\nIf I take a screen shot on my rMBP 13' at a screen resolution of 2560x1600, the file that is saved has the same resolution, but opening it on the same machine, it looks a lot worse.\nIt seems that opening the 2560x1600 file on the same machine/display can only be done by scaling the image down 50%, to 1280x800.\nNow, I understand that the blurriness I see is due to the rescaling of the image (to 50% of the file resolution), since rescaling (never?) works absolutely perfect. \nHere's what I don't get: I can see how opening a Retina display screen shot on another (non-Retina) display would lead to this problem. But I don't see why, on the same machine and display, the screen shot I just took needs to be scaled to 50%.\nCould anyone take a moment and explain why that's the case?\nP.S. I realize that there are some workarounds which all seem to involve rescaling the image \"on the go\", as described for example here, or by using apps that do it for you (e.g. RetinaCapture). \nHowever, none of these solutions solve the problem described above: that the rescaled image will look (slightly) worse than what I see on the screen, and of which I want a 1:1 screen shot.\n(EDIT) Okay, just figured something out: When opening the 2560x1600 screen shot with an app called 'Acorn' (which I just downloaded, only trial mode), it looks perfect. So it seems to be somehow related to the image viewer. I tried before Preview, XnViewMP and Gimp -- on all of these the, the image is scaled down to 50% to display it entirely. Anyone knows what the difference is, and if I can set any of the above programs to perform like Acorn?\n(EDIT 2) A comment by user duozomo in this A.SE question suggests that the problem is due to different image viewers using different parameters for \"screen pixel per image pixel\". Can anyone confirm this? And if so, is there a known list of which programs use which parameter for this?\n\nA: A Retina display's default resolution is 1440x900. I believe the screenshot feature takes a screenshot of what the monitor \"seeds\", so a 2560x1600 resolution of a 1440x900 screen.\nI'd have a look at RetinaCapture, an app designed to take screenshots on a Retina Mac.\n", "Q: Optimise use of hardware under Mac + Windows in virtual machine I use a macbook pro with OS X El Capitan 10.11.4, 2,5 GHz Intel Core i7 and 8 GB 1333 MHz DDR3. \nI need to code in Visual Studio and use Microsoft Excel for Windows, thus I installed Parallels Desktop 11 for Mac Business Edition Vestion 11.2.0, installed Windows 10 and Visual Studio 2015.

Fan working and hot is not an issue - it will happen (try compiling gcc under OSX on an i7 CPU all 8 threads will be running for several minutes) I would although give more memory to the VM\nTo see what is taking CPU you need to look at Activity Monitor in OSX (which will show Parallels taking up a lot of CPU) and Task Manager(I might have forgotten the correct name) in Windows to show what the VM is spending its time on\n", "Q: El Capitan 10.11.5 beta giving us the bird On a MacBook Air running the latest El Capitan public beta (10.11.5) we're seeing very high CPU utilization (25 to 100+%) by the bird process. \nWe're seeing a number of errors (rather than a persistent one) some of the more common ones are:\n[ERROR] 57226.692 [2016-05-07 22:23:40.422] upload/com.apple.CloudDocs     sync.transfer        BRCTransferBatchOperation.m:222\n        failed uploading 1 items (178 bytes) in com.apple.CloudDocs: <CKError 0x7f8a6bf3ba40: \"Partial Failure\" (2/1011); \"Failed to modify some records\"; partial errors: {\n                documentContent/817537A5-F0B6-4F4C-A7DB-C4C6204751D6:(com.apple.CloudDocs:__defaultOwner__) = <CKError 0x7f8a6e021b60: \"Asset File Modified\" (17/3003); \"generation counter mismatch (4 != 3)\">\n\n[ERROR] 58828.969 [2016-05-07 22:50:22.699] NSXPCConnection.user.580       xpc.client                 BRCXPCClient.m:808\n        nil error: <NSError:0x7f8a6be86540(NSPOSIXErrorDomain:1) - {\n            NSDescription = \"can't create container for (null)\";\n        }>\n\nThe resulting CPU utilization makes the machine almost unusable, any suggestions for a solution short of turning off iCloud drive?\n\nA: I have actually had decent luck with Apple online support when this hit one of our Macs.

Not sure if they fixed it server side or an update that came out a day later resolved it for me. I didn’t have to change any files on my side.\n", "Q: Is there really no way to force Time Machine to do a second, independent backup? Edit: I originally asked this in terms of forcing TM to do a \"full\" backup. After getting answers about how every backup is a \"full\" backup, I realized I asked the wrong question. The problem is that I have a backup that I don't trust, on a disk that has other stuff on it, including TM backups from other machines. I'd like to do another backup of one of my machines, independent from the first one. Below is the rest of my original question.\nI've looked all over, and there just doesn't seem to be a way to do this. Lots of people taking guesses that seem to work in some cases, but not in mine. I've tried just deleting the folder that contains the backup, but of course the finder won't let you delete it, or even rename it. Bash won't allow it either -- it always says \"operation not permitted\". Is there really no way just to make TM do a second, independent backup to the same disk without reformatting it?\n\nA: Every backup is a full backup. Your destination has hard links to each file so that if you copy any snapshot to another volume or folder - you have a copy of every file. If you delete a file from one time interval - the other intervals lose no data. As implemented, there is no reason to store duplicate bits on e destination if a hard link suffices to fully document each file being backed up. \n\nA: Use Disk Utility to create a new partition and point Time Machine to that.\n\nA: If you want to do a mirrored backup use something like rsync or Carbon Copy Cloner.\nTime machine's mission is to make incremental backups every hour so you can browse and restore old versions of your documents. It wouldn't be my choice for making a full mirrored backup of a hard drive.\nRsync is built in to OSX so the price is right and it can synchronize two folders or whole drives.\nGood luck!\n\nA: In your situation, I'd try doing a backup with Super Duper.  \nwww.shirt-pocket.com/SuperDuper/\nIt will be a full backup, can go on any drive with enough free space for the backup, and takes you away from any possible issues with Time Machine.\n", "Q: Gmail App doesn't allow zooming in for Apple devices? This is what my Mom said. She is an Apple user and is the only Apple user in my immediate family. I can't help really help her because she is not very technoliterate, and she and I are in different countries.\nShe says she is using iPhone 6 plus and iPad Mini.\nIf so, how does one fix or get around this? Is there a setting to change? Is there an alternative app to use?\nIf not, did the iOS Gmail App have this problem before? Do old Apple devices have this problem on the iOS Gmail App?\n\nA: Pinch-to-zoom on an email works in Gmail's latest iOS app (version 4.4) and Apple's native iOS Mail app (tested as far back as iOS 6).\nMaybe she does not know how to pinch-to-zoom?\n\nA: That is somewhat incorrect.  Pinch Zoom works on some emails, not others.  It is mostly inconsistent. (And yes, I'm using Gmail App 4.4 on IOS 9.2.3 beta)\nMost of the time, pinch zoom does nothing. On some Emails it does zoom the text.\n", "Q: Gmail Exchange accounts Cannot Get Mail, server connection failed, on new device I have an iPhone 4s and an iPad 2. The 4s runs iOS 7, the iPad 2 runs iOS 9.3. On both devices, I have two Gmail accounts (one is straight gmail, one is a business domain), configured as Exchange accounts rather than Google accounts so new emails are pushed, not fetched.\nNow, I just got an iPhone SE, restored from a backup of the 4s (and by the way on Cricket when the 4s was AT&T, but doubt that matters as my problem exists on WiFi too). Everything works on the new iPhone SE except the Gmail accounts no longer can get mail or connect to the server. They still work on the iPad. I know at first Gmail blocked my new phone thinking somebody else had gotten my password but I told it that that was me logging in and I can use both accounts as regular Google accounts or signing in directly with Safari. But I don't want email fetched, I want it pushed like o the iPad and the old phone.\nI have tried deleting the accounts and re-adding them, and in the Accounts preferences area it seems to successfully connect and doesn't tell me that I have the wrong password unless I actually have the wrong password. But in Mail it just cannot connect to the server and I'm at a loss.\nDoes anybody have an idea of the cause and how to fix this?\n\nA: I discovered the answer. It turns out Google disabled Exchange for new logins on iOS unless you have a paid business account. So for now my solution is to have the Gmail app installed so I get live notifications and use the default mail app to organize or write email.\n\nA: I had the same problem after upgrading to iPhone 6sPlus and restoring my latest iCloud backup.\nI also use a Google for Business email account. \nI tried deleting and re-adding the account; didn't work.\nI had to go into the admin console (admin.google.com) under Device Management and add the new phone as an approved device.\nThat fixed the problems immediately\n", "Q: Macbook bad internet connection WIFI I rented a room in a shared house (we are in 5).\nWhat I've noticed is from my room the internet connection is really bad (sometimes it doesn't even load the google homepage).\nMy guess is not that the bandwith is saturated even though there are 5 of us, instead that there is some kind of router problem in managing many devices all at once (like if I turn off my cell wifi gets slightly better).\nToday I was downloading a file at 1.5 mb/s from this connection even though pages struggled to load, but as soon as I clicked the download button it went straight up to 1.5 mb/s with a decent speed stability.\nMoreover I think the signal is good enough 4/4 in the indicator at the top-right of the screen.\nHow can I solve this? I also noticed my cell has kind of priority if compared to my mac since sometimes when I cannot even load google with the pc I can navigate with my cell browser.\nWhat is the reason behind this? Are there any solutions? If there's this \"priority system\" how can I put my pc at the top?\n\nA: Over time, Wifi hardware has progressed through several versions. In addition to higher speeds, the newer versions tend to offer better connection quality when there are many wifi signals and other interference in the vicinity. It could be that your computer has older wifi hardware than your phone, and hence is not able to handle the interference as well, producing slower speeds.  Interference is especially likely if you live near many other homes with people using wifi, too. \nIf you are on a Mac (assuming you are because this is AskDifferent), you can see what Wifi revision your Mac supports by doing the following:\nClick the menubar Apple logo in the upper left corner of the screen, then \"About this Mac\", then \"System Report\", then \"Wi-Fi\" mid-way down the list on the left.  About 14 lines down in the right-hand pane, you should see an entry for \"Supported PHY Modes:\".  Next to this you'll see something like \"802.11 a/b/g/n/ac\". Those letters indicate the WiFi versions your hardware supports, with \"a\" being the oldest, and \"ac\" being the newest. Versions \"n\" and \"ac\" in particular added improved support for handling lots of interference from congested airwaves.\n[Added based on receiving more model information from OP:]\nYou have support for wireless version \"n\" in your laptop, but not version \"ac\".  There may be a performance difference between these two standards in your situation.  If you can find a machine (computer, cell phone, tablet) with support for \"ac\", try testing that in your room to see if speeds are better than you are getting on your 2008 Macbook. If so, then this is the issue (and please up vote this answer; thanks!).\n", "Q: how to convert all mp3 to m4a and save tags and covers? Strange bugs with iTunes and iphone, when trying to transfer and listen files in mp3. In m4a everything is all right. Is there any way to convert all mp3 files to m4a and save all tags and covers? Thanks.\n\nA: The conversion & the discard of the old mp3 will have to be done in 2 steps, so you need to make sure you've enough disk space to temporarily store double the amount of space the mp3s currently take up. If not, you'll have to do the conversion/discard in small batches, one album at a time.\nStart in iTunes Prefs > General > Import Settings...\nSet to AAC Encoder.\n \nThen, back in iTunes main window, switch to My Music & sort by Songs, which makes things easier to find.\nIf it doesn't show already even if you scroll the window to the right, then right-click the top of the columns in the main window & add a column for Kind.\nClick this column to sort by Kind \nThe sort is simply alphabetical, so at the top will be AAC files, Apple Lossless etc., further down MPEG [mp3s] Below that may be other file types so make sure you don't accidentally select any of those.\nClick the top MPEG file, scroll down & shift/click the last one.\nRight click one & Select Create AAC version.\nWait until the process is finished - minute or hours depending on how many tunes...\nYou then need to find all the original mp3s that will still be in their original locations, now with an AAC file next to each one.\nNavigate to your iTunes Music folder ~/Music/iTunes/iTunes Media/Music hit  Cmd ⌘   F  & type mp3. The search will offer name matches: mp3 or kind is mp3 audio, pick kind.\nAssuming you converted all your mp3s, anything showing in that search result can now be deleted. Simply select all & Trash.\nTo be certain, relaunch iTunes & scroll down the song list, making sure nothing has an exclamation mark ! at the left, which would indicate a missing file.\nOne you're sure, you can empty the trash.\n", "Q: What is the normal operating temperature for the MacBook (2016 generation)? My MacBook sometimes becomes hot when I'm using it, and I want to make sure it is operating within normal temperature. What's the operating temperature for the MacBook that was released in May 2016 normally?\n\nA: Internally, the processor is rated to run up to 100°C and since this model has no blower or fans, that heat will be conducted out to the frame. The nature of conductive heat transfer is that the case itself won't get that hot unless it's insulated to near perfection.\n\nThe system will slow down the processor to keep the internal thermal temperatures in line, but most modern cell phones, tablets and computers will get warmer than most people feel is proper and run just fine for extended periods of time. If a store is close, you might make an appointment and have them run diagnostics - just because they are designed to be within the specs - failures can happen on the chips and on the sensors to make yours painfully hot. I would always have someone trained look over something you feel could be a fire risk or dangerous no matter what I say is normal.\n\nA: The aluminum chassis of the MacBook works as a heat sink itself. Translates the internal heat to the outside. It's normal that the housing is quite hot, always within a limit. Unless the temperature exceeds 80 ºC, I wouldn't worry at all.\n\nA: Considering that the entire line of MacBooks have no fans, I wouldn't be surprised if it got to the range of 50°C while idle.\nApple only supplies minimum and maximum ambient temperatures; the specified ambient temperature range for your MacBook 50° to 95° F (10° to 35° C) (source). Unless you're using your MacBook in an abnormally warm environment (i.e. direct sunlight in a tropical country), your MacBook shouldn't get too much hotter than its regular idle temperatures.\nMy 13\" Retina MacBook Pro, mid-2014 version can get rather warm when idle (~50°C-60°C) especially if placed on a non-heat conducive surface like a mattress or my legs. I don't mean to get too technical, but you can think of the entire unibody as a rather large heatsink that conducts heat away from your Mac (another reason why sometimes the entire computer feels warm and not just one region). It's also important to remember that OS X will shut your computer down if it gets too hot (>100°C IIRC).\nUnless the MacBook in question is exceeding 80°C while idle with no absurd CPU usage or rogue processes (check with Activity Monitor for process CPU usage), I wouldn't see any cause for concern about the temperature of your MacBook.\n\nA: You can find your processor model by entering the following into a terminal:\nsysctl -n machdep.cpu.brand_string\n\nwhich will return a string, for example, like this:\nIntel(R) Core(TM) i5-5287U CPU @ 2.90GHz\n\nYou can then search for your processor on the intel product specifications page, by pasting for example i5-5287U into the search box.\nOn the resulting page you will see something called TJUNCTION ...\n\nThis is the maximum temperature recommended for that processor. You can monitor this with htop.\n\nA: To follow up on comments relating to fans, I am unsure why posters are stating that \"entire line of MacBooks have no fans,\" because they do have fans. All of them. It is true that they use their cases as heat sinks, but they also all utilize fans. You can monitor your internal temps with apps such as smc fan control. That particular app will also allow you to set manual fan speeds and create specific profiles that you could select based off of what type of processing you are using you computer for.\n", "Q: iPhone could not be restored - error number -1 I posted an old iPhone 4 to my sister (I'm in Australia; she's in Thailand) which was working fine both before and after she received it.\nRecently it has started cutting off while being used - especially when using data - and saying there's 'no reception'. This was happening every couple of weeks.\nMy sister has been restoring the iPhone through iTunes each time this happens, which had been resolving the problem until it came back again.\nUnfortunately now though it is no longer restoring through iTunes, and showing this error message:\n\n\nThe iPhone \"iPhone\" could not be restored. An unknown error occured (-1)\n\nObviously this is a pretty unhelpful error message. This Apple support page covers the next steps for most error types, but it appears that the error number -1 is an error in and of itself!\nThe phone is now stuck on the usual restore screen:\n\nWhat steps could we try to resolve this? Or is it likely that the phone is just too old and is suffering from software designed for newer iPhones? In case it is relevant, the phone has never been jailbroken and I (and my wife) have always been the original owners. It is a 4, not a 4S.\n\nA: If it auto shutdown too often and require restore everytime like that then you should consider the phone is too old. Hardware especially its memory start malfunctioning. As end user, there is nothing you can do, sorry :(\nBut repair services does, hehe :D\n", "Q: How do I get a folder tree view in the left column of the Finder? I'd like to have a tree view of my current folder (it's children and it's parents) for navigation in the left column of the finder's UI. How do I get that?\n\nA: Favorites in the left hand side is a flat list, but it's a good place to store some frequent destinations.\nAnd make sure to select the third option (circled) so you can have a tree structure in your Finder.\nLast but not least, you may notice that the screenshot has a Path Bar at the bottom indicating your current location in the hierarchy. And I think this is the closest thing if you are asking for a Windows Explorer type layout. Enable it in the Finder menu: View->Show Path Bar\n\n\nA: In OS X’s Finder, the key combination ⌘+3 arranges the view in column (tree) fashion.\nIf you wish to add the folder to the Finder’s sidebar, simply drag and drop the folder into it under the “Favorites” designation. \nIf you wish to make the column view the default view for that folder, use the key combination  ⌘+j with the desired folder selected and then check the option always open [browse] in column view.\n", "Q: Macbook Retina recognizing replaced SSD as external despite being internal Just bought a Retina Macbook Pro and swapped the SSD for a 1TB drive, it boots and seems to run fine, except the drive in 'about' shows as external and when I set in finder show/hide external it appears/disappears-\nIs this going to be an issue (boots and runs) and how can I fix it?\n\nA: I believe it will only show up as internal if it's connected to the internal bus on the motherboard.  Anything else will display as external.  You can change the icons if you want it to look like an internal drive from Finder.\n", "Q: Does Parrallel win 10 work well for Macbook 12\" 2016? Does Parrallel win 10 work well for Macbook 12\" 2016 ? I am going to buy new MacBook 12\" as it is so cool. However, I need to use Microsoft Office 365 for my work with full compability. \n\nA: Yes. Parallels will work with any reasonably new Mac with relatively little performance hit. It uses virtualization technology, and should suit your needs.\nWith that said, MS Office 365 is compatible with OS X, so I'm not sure why you'd need to use a VM at all.\n", "Q: Mac office, outlook keep calendar invite in e-mail box When I recieve an calendar invite and send an 'accept' the message itself is being deleted out of my mail box. I know the invite itself is able to stay in your mailbox but the big question is how?!\nDoes anyone know how to keep your outlook calendar invite as an e-mail?\n\nA: It's simple (until MS changes the pref on this): just accept the invitation to the meeting from the calendar, NOT your inbox. \n\nA: As noted on the official microsoft forum it's not a feature on outlook for mac. This feature is only available at the Windows versions of outlook and never been a feature of the mac version.\n\nA: Recently, my work allowed us to connect to Exchange via Mac. I have used, for years BusyMac's BusyCal because it has far superior Alert window options (that just matters a lot to me.) I put my account creds into BusyCal and have been getting sync perfectly. Today, not sure why, I wondered what would happen if I accepted a meeting from BusyCal instead of Outlook. \nAnswer: It keeps the invitation in the Inbox! (Something I have wanted so much, too).\nUp to you if having that matters enough to buy BusyCal. But at least we have a solution until MS build it into Outlook for Mac.\n", "Q: How does the sudo key symbol work? I'm trying to write a script that requests the user password for some sudo-related commands. My goal is to emulate the default method that OS X uses to obtain the user's password, Password: followed by a key-like symbol, as seen in the screenshot attached below: \n\nI tried the answer from How to get a password from a shell script without echoing over on Stack Overflow that uses read -s, but that results in Password: without the key symbol when run from a script, but displays the symbol when run from the Terminal itself . What is this key symbol, and can I find it under the Characters menu?\n\nA: I get the key symbol when running read -s in Terminal.\nAs this seems to work the same for read -s as for sudo, I assume this is a feature of Terminal (to display a key symbol whenever input is requested in silent/hidden mode).\n\nA: The simplest answer is just write the script without sudo\nthen tell the user to run it with sudo e.g. sudo script\nthe script will run with root privileges\n`this has the advantage that the user knows what asks for and where the password is used, if in your script you could be taking a copy or leaving it in memory\n\nA: I think it has something to do with whether the terminal echo option is disabled. I tried running stty -echo; cat; stty echo in my terminal and then typing something, and the key symbol showed. I then pressed Ctrl+D and it went away.\n", "Q: Launchd based daemon exit with abnormal code 1, without crash log I've seen many questions that relate to specific daemons/applications that exit on this same exit code (=1).

Credit goes here:\n\n\n*\n\n*Confirm cellular data is enabled by going to Settings > Cellular > Cellular Data\n\n*Try turning Airplane mode on and off again by going to Settings > Airplane Mode\n\n*Go to Settings > General > Restrictions > Cellular Data Use, make sure “Don’t Allow Changes” is toggled off, then tap Settings > Cellular, then turn Cellular Data to OFF, wait a few seconds, then turn Cellular Data back to ON\n\n*Reset Network Settings by going to  Settings > General > Reset > Reset Network Settings\n\n*Reboot your device.\n\n*Uninstall and install any problem app.\n\n\nIf nothing above helps you, you could try this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Back up your device (Settings > iCloud > Backup > Back Up Now)\n\n*You can see your recent back ups by going to Settings > iCloud > Storage > Manage Storage\n\n*Restore your device. Important this will erase everything. This is why you should back up first. \n\n*Connect your device to your computer. In iTunes, select your device, and click Restore.\nYour device will restart. Simply follow the setup assistant and set it up as NEW, don’t set up from a backup because it is highly likely that this problem is due to corrupt information, this means that problem will repeat if you restore from a backup. We will restore your device from iCloud later.\n\n*Now verify that the problem is resolved\n\n*After verifying, now restore your iCloud backup. To do this, go to Settings > General > Reset > Erase all content and settings. \n\n*When your device restarts, tap Restore from a Backup.\n\n", "Q: Could we turn on word wrap Safari Web Inspector? I think it's a bug for sure.\nOlder Safari versions, it has word wrap in that area but when updated, it seems there is no word wrap in web inspector console. \nCould we reenable it again ?\nIs that possible ?\n\n\nA: Word wrap works a little differently, but actually more accurate, in the latest versions of Safari, depending on the mode you're displaying.\nFor instance, in the \"Elements\" tab, it will wrap as desired:\n\nBut, like in your screenshot, the \"Resources\" tab for instance, it will display as the rendering engine intended, unwrapped:\n\n\nA: Click on the settings cog-wheel to the far right of the tabs and check the box that reads \"Wrap lines to editor width\".

At least none listed in the Apple Support Documents listed below.\n\n\n*\n\n*Safari 6/7 (Mavericks): Safari shortcuts\n\n*Safari 8 (Yosemite): Safari keyboard and other shortcuts\n\n*Safari 9 (El Capitan): Safari keyboard and other shortcuts\nOne might be able to create an Automator Service with a Run Apple Script Action to manipulate tabs in a Safari windows and then assign it a keyboard shortcut in Keyboard System Preferences, however I'd imagine it might not be to easy to code.\nUpdate:\nI looked through the Safari AppleScript Dictionary and played around with the coding of an AppleScript script to manipulated tab ordering, or I should say the appearance of tab ordering, as even a simple command such as move last tab to before first tab required a refresh of the URL. In other words whether or not I coded it via move or switching the URL of the current and next tab, etc, all methods I tried forces/requires a refresh of the URL, where dragging and dropping a tab only changes the tab order and does not refresh any tab when done in a DnD manner.\nIn conclusion, if you don't mind the tab URL being refreshed then the appearance of drag and drop can be accomplished however to physically move a tab without it refreshing would probably require the use of third-party utilities and much more complex coding then coding using move or swapping the URLs of adjacent tabs, etc.\n", "Q: How to upgrade storage for Macbook Air? I'm getting my first Mac, a Macbook Air 2015. My other machine is a PC used for gaming and I thought I could use my external HDD with both. Now I see NTFS is read only in OS X. For now it's unlikely that I'll run out of space on the 128GB SSD because I stream both videos and music and don't save large collections of photos or videos on the notebook but if might need some more space, what would be the best way to upgrade storage? Move the files on the HDD to my PC, format it to another file system and only use it with the Macbook? Does OS X have a utility for that? I heard it's possible to upgrade the SSD but will it void my warranty to have it done?\n\nA: Your best option is to get a memory expansion module.  I have a 2013 Air and I purchased the PNY 128gb StorEDGE.  It's very fast and would double the available storage on your Air.\nAs others have indicated, opening the Air to add another/bigger SSD would be more expensive and difficult than just adding an expansion module.\n\nA: You can reformat your HDD in FAT or exFAT format (from the Mac or from the PC), so you'll be able to use it with both machines.\nBTW the software to use on the mac is Disk Utility, in Applications /Utilities\n", "Q: Setting Romanian diacritics using AltGr on El Capitan I'm a Linux user, using Ubuntu for few years. Recently I bought a Macbook and I'm trying to understand how to set up my Romanian language layout.\nMy mac has a Romanian keyboard, but since I am a programmer I want to use all the characters (including [, ], {etc). Currently if I set up the keyboard layout to be Romanian on my macbook, if I press [ I get ă, which is expected, but it's not something I'm used to.\nI would like to use AltGr + a to get the Romanian diacritic letter that looks like a, but is ă and when pressing [ to get [.\nIn fact, I need the following combinations:\n\n\n*\n\n*AltGr + a => ă\n\n*AltGr + q => â\n\n*AltGr + i => î\n\n*AltGr + s => ș\n\n*AltGr + t => ț\n\n*AltGr + Shift + a => Ă\n\n*AltGr + Shift + - => long dash\n\n\nHow to set up this?\nOn Ubuntu this was activated as default thing. I read a little bit how to do it on OS X and found that Ukelele could help. Isn't there a more native way (e.g. just importing a preset keyboard layout)?\n\nA: Bit of a shameless plug: https://github.com/SaltwaterC/romanian-programmers-mac\nI've created this keyboard layout as none I could find were actually following the standard for Romanian Pro. I may jump across platforms during a normal day, therefore the layout was an important thing for my use case. Works without changes since 10.8. Now I'm on 10.11.\nBear in mind there's no AltGr on Apple's keyboard. Both Alt/Option keys produce the same keycode. Using the right Option key on Apple's hardware is a matter of convention rather than a necessity.\n\nA: The \"native\" way in OS X would be to use the US (ABC) Extended layout provided by Apple.  It lets you make the necessary characters via alt/option shortcuts.  For a list see\nhttp://symbolcodes.tlt.psu.edu/accents/codemacext.html\nFor the shortcut set you specified, Ukelele or Karabiner is what would normally be used.\nSome alternative Romanian layouts made with Ukelele can be found at\nhttp://www.unibuc.ro/e/prof/paliga_v_s/soft-reso/\n\nA: I don't think is possible by regular preferences of El Capitan, what you want is a new keyboard layout. In Brazil we have two for the same keyboard: the original and the \"International PC\" that make the special chars as IBM-PC. \nHowever you can use the text tab of Keyboard Preferences to make replacements when you type a combination of chars as &a' = á. You will make up your own like &a\" = ă (you will have to use the Symbols option of Edit menu to find the character since will not be available in the current keyboard).\n", "Q: How can I downgrade the iOS on my Ipad 2nd Gen when iTunes says I am \"not eligible? My ipad 2nd generation is super sluggish and crashing a lot. It was suggested that I downgrade from the current release - which it runs on now - to iOS 7. I tried doing this through itunes and picking my own OS file to restore but I was told the ipad was not eligible for that back up. What is the best way to do that? Thx.\n\nA: I'm afraid it's not possible. Apple stops signing iOS releases shortly after the release of a new version, at which point the old version can no longer be installed.\n", "Q: Mac -- HDMI to USB/Thunderbolt I know there are small USB boxes which are able to pass through image from HDMI (and record it) to computer. Is there something similar which would enable me to see stuff from HDMI on my Mac?\nWhy: I am trying to discover possibilities how to use iMac, which I might be buying, as a target screen. I read there was this possibility for older iMacs, but only with other Apple computer. I want to connect PS3 or in future maybe some other console/device.\n\nA: If I understand you correctly, what you are looking for is a video capture device.\nThe way it works is video that is sent out from another source like a game console, DVD player, or even another computer it captured by this device and encoded to video.\nOne that a client of mine has used and seemed to like very much is this one by [Elgato][2]\nNow, if you are looking to buy a Mac (I am assuming iMac because of the built in display) and using it as a target screen, it is important to know that while it is possible on some iMacs, it's not possible on all and only possible with other Mac hardware.  See Apple Support for full details.\nIf having an external display for other devices is a high priority, don't get an iMac - get a Mac Mini instead and get a high quality monitor with multiple inputs.\n", "Q: 'cat' not displaying line breaks For some reason cat no longer shows line breaks when I use it, while all other tools (grep, more etc) do.\nI am using iterm2 on OSX 10.11.4.\nWhat could be causing this behaviour?\nExample\nI have a file test.txtcreated in vim:\nthis is a test\nthis is a test\nthis is a test\n\nWhen I do cat test.txt the output is (note space in place of newline):  \nthis is a test this is a test this is a test\n\n\nA: These things can occur based on a whole bunch of small issues, either in the shell used, the terminal application used, the file format or something else altogether.\nTo triage, the following steps may be useful\n\n\n*\n\n*run cat -vet test.txt to see whether there are additional characters in the file\n\n*run (echo a; echo b)|cat to see if it depending on the input data\n\n*switch terminal applications to see if this is the cause\n\n*run bash --noprofile to see whether something is lurking in the shell configuration\n\n\nIn my case someone had modified 'cat' behaviour in .bashrc\n", "Q: Dead bugs/insects in laptop I cracked the LCD screen of my Macbook Air a few days ago and dropped it off at the Apple store to get it replaced. The 'Genius' there said it would cost around $500 and that having another repair shop fix it would void its warranty (I have the Apple Care package), so I authorized the repair.\nToday I received a call from the Apple store that the technician who opened up the laptop found 'a few dead bugs' in the laptop and since this is a 'biohazard', they won't be able to do the fix themselves. They weren't specific about the kind of bugs they found.\nBugs are definitely a pest but not a biohazard unless they're known vectors of transmittable diseases but I'm pretty sure the Apple store doesn't have trained entomologists on payroll masquerading as technicians to make that distinction. By this logic, the moment anyone sees a bug in an Apple Store, anyone can scream 'OMG, biohazard!', have the store shut down and wait for the friendly folks in hazmat suits to arrive. In fact, I have half a mind to do precisely that this weekend.\nAFAIK I have no bedbugs whatsoever but anyway, can I try taking it to another store? Also, will this void the warranty?\n\nA: Just doing a quick bit of research, I ran across this post on Apple's support forums that sounded eerily similar to your situation.\nWhat I gathered from the article is that\n\n\n*\n\n*You should immediately ask for photographic evidence\n\n*You should document with Apple customer relations (1-800-676-2775 in the US)\n\n*The bugs themselves won't void the warranty, but the Apple tech can void the warranty on his own accord (if he believes they are a biohazard)\n\n\nThere are a couple of things you can try:\n\n\n*\n\n*Take the MBA back, remove the back cover and using a can of compressed air, blow out any remnants of the bugs.  There are no tamper resistant stickers or tags that will indicate that you did this.  Bring it back to another Apple store, tell them what the first one told you and claim it's BS.  Depending on the year of the MBA (2012 and later) you might need a Pentalobe screwdriver.  Older than that, and a regular jeweler's Phillips will do just fine.\n\n*If that option isn't feasible, avoid the \"Geniuses\" at all costs.  I have never found them competent in solving problems.  There are some good Apple repair shops.

I've gotten mixed answers from various websites and people concerning this question, and I wanted to put it out there for all of you to answer once and for all.\nThe question is, does force closing apps, (that is, double-clicking the home button, then swiping up on them), have any benefit to the battery or overall performance of an iPhone or any other iOS device?\n\nA: There's been much debate and discussion around this topic.  I believe it was beneficial for iOS back in the v3 and v4 days but now it's not.\nCraig Federighi even came out recently saying it's not necessary and it doesn't increase the battery life.  Apple has built-in their memory management the proper time to suspend and/or kill an app when necesssary.  The only time you should force-close an app is if it has become unresponsive.\n\nA: In one circumstance, a force quit can have a benefit to iOS that outweighs the cost of more processing needed to clean up the process, restart it, and purge any files that are cached/open.\nThe negative to doing this is that apps don't run in the background - so once you switch to a new app or the springboard / list of icons / lock screen - iOS has already stopped / paused / flushed all filesystem activity for the app.\nIt signals to a frozen app that it needs to fully reinitialize itself from scratch - disregarding any saved state or cached results. It signals to Apple in the form of a crash report (and optionally to the developer) some breadcrumbs exactly where the app was in the code when it was \"killed\" by the user.\n\n\n*\n\n*In terms of performance - force quitting apps makes iOS and the app perform worse - measurably worse in many cases.\n\n*In terms of battery life - force quitting apps makes iOS and the battery life perform measurably worse as well.\n\n\nThink of it like surgery - you are doing clear harm in the short term - unless you are sure surgery is needed, don't take the performance hit and force quit.\n\nA: Lately this subject is a hot item again. I strongly believe it's useless to force quit apps on iOS devices. It's only helpful to restart apps when they crashed. Here more information.\n9to5Mac:\n\nIt's been a long-standing belief in some circles that using the\n  multitasking feature of iOS to force quit apps can help save an\n  iPhone's battery life, or improve the speediness of the software when\n  the smartphone becomes slow. \nEarlier in the week, an iPhone user decided to email Apple CEO Tim\n  Cook to put the issue to bed once and for all, and instead got a reply\n  from Craig Federighi, Apple's senior VP of Software Engineering (via\n  9to5Mac).\n\n\n \nHere, from the official support document on forcing applications to close, is Apple’s own advice on when to use this feature:\n\nWhen you double-click the Home button, your recently used apps appear.\n  The apps aren’t open, but they’re in standby mode to help you navigate\n  and multitask. You should force an app to close only when it’s\n  unresponsive.\n\n \nMacDailyNews quotes a 2010 email from Steve Jobs:\n\nJust use [iOS multitasking] as designed, and you’ll be happy. No need\n  to ever quit apps.\n\n \nJust in case you don’t believe Apple’s senior vice president for software, Apple’s own official support documentation, or Steve Jobs, here are some other articles pointing out how this habit is actually detrimental to iPhone battery life:\n\n\n*\n\n*Fraser Speirs (back in 2012!): “Misconceptions About iOS Multitasking”\n\n*Thorin Klosowski: “Quitting All Your Apps in iOS Can Actually Worsen Battery Life”\n\n*Kendall Baker: “Stop Force Quitting Your iPhone Apps”\n\n*The Wirecutter: “What You Should (and Shouldn’t) Do to Extend Your Phone’s Battery Life”\n\n*Kyle Richter: “The Force Quit Fallacy”\n\n\nA: Theoretically, yes. Apps running at background do consume memory (their threads still exist and that's why you can see them listed when you double click the Home button), and thus they do consume battery. \nBut practically, not really. iOS does a fairly good job on memory management, and apps running at background only consume a small amount of memory. And if other apps running at foreground (actively running and users are interacting with them) need more memory, the iOS system may terminate the background apps and purge the memory. The reason that sometimes force-closing an app seems to save memory/battery life is because that, some apps may request to run long-running tasks even running at background, for the purpose of, for instance, background fetching, periodically syncing data, etc (note that not every app does that). But you can disable these by configuring Background App Refresh in Settings -> General. \nSo in summary, for an app that isn't doing much when at background, force closing it won't yield noticeable benefits. \n\nA: I have found that ending the Facebook app in particular can save battery life. After checking its usage in the battery section (Settings > Battery > Time), I can't help but be convinced that it's not playing nice. \n", "Q: bt headphones call ended on connect I recently bought Sennheiser Momentum 2.0 bluetooth headphones and I use them mainly with my imac. After a bit of fiddling I figured out to force aptx via the bluetooth explorer and disable the handsfree profile as well, as countless people are recommending. \nAt this point I'm pretty happy except for one minor annoyance: I can't connect the headphones without OS X insisting on dropping the sound quality as if it were receiving a call and then deciding it is not a call after all and switching back to normal quality. I'm not sure if this is specific to OSX or the momentum 2.0, or both.\nSymptoms: I turn the headphones on. Almost immediately it announces \"connected\", as it should. If any music is playing at this point it first plays at good quality but almost immediately it changes to very low quality. After a few seconds the head phone announces \"call ended\". From then on everything is fine.\nI've been searching for a resolution to this but I haven't been able to find anything that even confirms this is a known issue. So, is there a way to skip the whole connected ... call ended ritual? I'm not actually interested in answering any calls with this thing.\n\nA: It turned out the problem was Skype. I have this running all the time and when you turn on your bt headphones it tries out the microphone as if it was in a call before ending the call. The problem goes away if you don't have Skype running. Alternatively, you can connect your headphones with skype open and then switch to its sound settings end switch things back to internal speakers & microphone. It seems to persist these settings even when you disconnect/reconnect the headphones after that.\n", "Q: Macbook Pro Late 2011 15\" Inc I currently have a Macbook Pro late 2011 15 inch which is running Mac OS X 10.7.5 which is a little outdated for my preference.

The little red dot in the upper-left corner of a window is the obvious way to close it, but that little dot requires careful (aka slower) mousing to hit it, especially when compared to a browser tab, dock icon, or other frequently-clicked areas that are much larger.\nCan I make the little red \"window close\" button larger?  If not, is there some other mouse-only way to close a window that is easier to target with a fast mouse?\nI know I can switch over to the keyboard and use ⌘ Command W to close the window, but I'm a lefty mouse user so I'd have to move my hand off the mouse to hit this key combo, and then move my hand back to the mouse again to continue working. Given that this mouse->close window->mouse sequence is an action I do 100+ times per day, I was hoping to have a faster way to do it.\nI'm currently using an old USB mouse with a wheel and two buttons.\n\nA: If you are using Magic Mouse - there's BetterTouchTool where you can set custom gestures. \nFor example you can assign ⌘+w to three fingers click globally. Here's how this looks like:\n\nYou can also assign actions to \"Normal Mice\" if it has additional keys.\n\nA: You didn't mention what mouse you used, but for me, I use the Logitech MX anywhere mouse and have programmed the buttons to issue keystrokes specific to the way that I work.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Zoom is ⌘Q for Quit\n\n*The bottom button isF3 Mission Control\n\n*The back button is  ⌘W for Close\n\n*The forward button is ⌘I for Get Info\n\n\nThis is all built into the Logitech software and you can customize pretty much every button to your specifications.\n\nThe new MX Master mouse also has this capability, but I wouldn't get it just yet - the Bluetooth has some issues to be solved.\nYou mentioned that you were left handed...the MX Anywhere 2 is an ambidextrous mouse with additional buttons - that should work well in this scenario; just with 2 fewer buttons.\n\n\nA: There's always changing the default keyboard shortcut available as an option. Instead of using ⌘ Command+W, you can change these default settings to something on the right-hand side of your keyboard (i.e. ⌘ Command+', provided nothing is using this existing keyboard shortcut) to avoid moving your left hand off the mouse.\nTo do so, navigate to the Shortcuts tab in System Preferences > Keyboard. Here, you will see something that looks like this (may differ slightly):\n\nClick on the App Shortcuts section, and under \"All Applications\", add a new shortcut called \"Close\" with your choice keyboard shortcut. I used ⌘ Command+' as an example.\n\nAnd that's all there is to it. Now, in (almost) every application, you can close with your new keyboard shortcut.\nNB: It's best to look through your applications' own menu items to see which menu title closes the window as these may differ slightly from application to application. You'll need to enter the exact menu title you wish to trigger into your shortcut. Replace \"Close\" with your applications' own menu title and it should work as such.\n\nA: In most applications, there is a \"close window\" menu option.  The menu title will be wider than the stoplight control, and you can push the mouse all the way to the top of the screen, so it is as if the target has infinite height. This can make it faster to hit the menu than the small close window control.\nIn most applications, if you hold option while clicking the red stop light or while selecting the menu command, all the open windows will be closed.\n\nA: The answer is very simple and works with any mouse. Click the red close button of one of the windows while holding the option key. All windows from that application will close. If you have a multi-button mouse, you can set one button or combination to be option-click.\n\nA: For the most control, I would suggest Karabiner.\n\n*\n\n*How to add your own settings\n\n*Basic syntax\nBelow are some configurations. They should be doable, even if the mouse doesn't have any extra buttons.\nIdea 1:\nChange mouse middle button (AKA 3rd button or scroll wheel button) to Cmd+W\n<!-- Middle mouse button = Command + W -->\n<autogen>\n  __KeyToKey__\n  PointingButton::MIDDLE, KeyCode::W, ModifierFlag::COMMAND_L\n</autogen>\n\nIdea 2:\nChange simultaneous press of Left and Right mouse buttons to Cmd+W\n<!-- Left + Right mouse button simultaneous press = Command + W -->\n<autogen>\n  __SimultaneousKeyPresses__\n  PointingButton::LEFT, PointingButton::RIGHT,\n  KeyCode::W, ModifierFlag::COMMAND_L\n</autogen>\n\nIdea 3:\nChange Command + Scrollwheel Up to Cmd+W.

Say a Mac Pro tower has OS X + Apps installed on a blazing fast PCIe SSD. It also has Time Machine enabled on a slow 5400rpm mechanical drive. The TM drive is internal and connected at all times.\nWill the relative slowness of the TM drive affect general performance when the Mac and its filesystem are being used strenuously? Are internally connected TM drives being being read/written to constantly?\n\nA: I don't see why one would have anything to do with the other. Drives are not being constantly read from and written to unless something needs to do that. You can play a video game and once it's in RAM it'll stop reading the hard drive in many cases. A large movie on the other hand will constantly read from the hard drive. But even still, Time Machine and your external drive are separate from the other stuff your computer does. While yes, it'll take longer to backup and restore from it, that's the extent of the slowness you'll have from it.\n\nA: I have a Mac Pro 2008 running El Capitan and also experienced slow downs with Time Machine. The slow downs had nothing to do with hard drive speed. I had never used Time Machine until I downgraded from Snow Leopard to El Capitan. I made a mistake and let Time Machine try to back up all connected drives. (I have four internal hard drives, and two external backup drives were connected.) I trashed Time Machine’s backups and set it to back up only my primary drive. It finished the backup overnight, but my Mac was still slow when Time Machine was on. Turning Time Machine off returned my Mac to normal speeds. I spent much time troubleshooting this problem. Some blog comments indicated that 'bad' permissions could cause slow downs during backups. I had many customized file and folder permissions from my Snow Leopard days. I went back to default permissions on all files and folders on my primary hard drive, and that bumped up my Mac's speed while Time Machine ran, but not to normal speed.\nMy Mac Pro had 5 GB of RAM, which Apple says is enough for El Capitan. However, RAM is cheap, so I bumped it to 11 GB. This did nothing for the Time Machine problem. It did help with Canvas Draw because it keeps as many graphic elements in RAM as possible.\nI gave up on continuous operation of Time Machine. I perform a clone backup daily and a Time Machine backup once a week. That has worked well. I’m retired, so a crash that causes one day of data loss isn’t a disaster. If you need continual backups, then I recommend more troubleshooting: Install your OS on an erased drive. Test some applications to get a feel for speed. Set up Time Machine and have it backup your drive. After that is done, use apps that create data such as a text editor, spreadsheet, iMovie, etc. See if your Mac's speed remains nearly the same while Time Machine backs up the new data. If there isn't a slow down, then something in your primary drive software is interacting with Time Machine to slow down your Mac. Trash your Time Machine preference file: com.apple.TimeMachine.plist in yourHardDrive/Library/Preferences. It's unlikely to help, but it's easy. If that doesn’t help, then fixing the problem is hard. This isn't like the good old days with Conflict Catcher. The only approach I know is a clean install followed by installing other apps one at a time until the one that contributes to the Time Machine slow downs is identified. This will take many hours. An alternative is to download demos of third party programs that offer continual backupa.\nIf the newly installed OS and software also experiences a slow down when Time Machine runs, then you may have a hardware problem. Good luck with that.\n\nA: In general, I would think that a slow Time Machine disk is not going to really affect the performance of your machine.\nIf you are using the 5400 RPM disk only for Time Machine, then the performance of that disk is only going to affect the speed that backups are made and recovered for the most part. It is true that when TM is running it is scanning your hard disk to determine what has changed, but you indicated that it is a PCIe connected SSD and thus I'd take a guess that you're probably not saturating that drive's performance most of the time. It does seem that TM runs at a lower priority and thus normal activity on the SSD is going to get precedence.\nIn general, the small slices that TM is going to steal from your SSD most likely aren't noticable and the slower performance of the 5400 RPM disk is isolated only to TM since you're not using it for anything else.\nFor some perspective, I have a 2008 MacPro3,1 with 1 SSD, 1 7200 and 2 5400 \"green\" drives in it and Time Machine goes out to a fairly slow ReadyNAS Duo on the network. When TM kicks off I can hear the drives in the MacPro chattering away, but I don't notice any slow down with what I'm doing since TM appears to be lower priority. However, attempting to go into TM to restore anything and it can be fairly abysmal. Fortunately, I rarely restore from backup :-)\n", "Q: Safari Back Button goes to old cached page, os X El Capitan, iMac On certain websites I visit Safari has a consistent problem.  Using the back button brings up an old cached version of the page.  Refresh works fine.  An example is http://forum.porsche356registry.org/viewforum.php?f=1.  If I read the threads on that page and click back, it will eventually start bringing up an old cached view of the page without refreshing the list of threads.\nI enabled the Develop menu in Safari and watched what happened in the inspector's network tab, when clicking back vs. clicking refresh (of the same page).  They do different things.  Refresh always runs the script viewforum.php, which I assume refreshes the list of topics.  Clicking back often did not run that script.  Looking for an explanation...\n\nA: I think the explanation is that Safari often uses the cached version of the page when you use the back button. If you want to force a refresh, you hit refresh. If you are on a forum and want to go back to the thread listing, you can usually click on a \"breadcrumb\" link near the page header. That will have the same effect as using the back button and hitting refresh, because Safari will understand your click to signal a new page visit.\n\n\nA: Sometimes, website will run a lot of javascript for ads, trackers, etc.  Each time one of these run, it can do a load of a section of the web page.  \nWhen you hit the back button, you're seeing the page as it was before that piece of script ran.  Most of the time, the page will look exactly the same because only a small part of the page was changed (and it's probably something you didn't look at anyway).  You think either a)the page didn't do anything, b)the Back button didn't do anything, or c)I'm seeing a cached version of the page.\nIf you hold down the back button you'll likely see bunch of pages there all named the same.  You have to hit the back button many times to get to the place you were before you hit this page.\nI would guess this is what's happening with the site you mentioned.  Many sites like that run small ads that refresh every few seconds.\n", "Q: Is DetectX itself malware? A friend installed Mackeeper, and I tried to uninstall it with DetectX.\nAs far as I know, DetectX is not known malware as I can only find positive comments about it. But, I'm concerned that I cannot say this has not damaged their Mac.\nWhat should I do?\nI am also in the process of a fresh install.\n\nA: I'm the developer of DetectX.\nA few facts about my app pertinent to your question:\ni. DetectX does not ask for admin rights either to install or run.\nii. DetectX does not install any 'helper' apps or contain any other binaries save for i. it's own macOS binary and ii. the Sparkle updater binary.\niii. DetectX cannot delete anything save for the things shown in the Search panel. The user has to authorise any deletion by first pressing the 'Trash All' button, and if the offending item requires admin privs, by further providing authorisation to either the Finder or osascript. This happens on a per-file basis - i.e., the user has to authorise each file individually. DetectX cannot do mass deletions of files outside of user space.\niv. DetectX itself never asks for or sees your admin password. Any requests made for permissions is done via osascript or the Finder, and they deal with the password request and carry out the requested task.\ni., ii., iii. and iv. were all deliberate design choices to make DetectX as safe as possible. Unlike some other security tools, DetectX itself cannot be hijacked to take over the user's system as it does not have - nor can it acquire - any root privileges.\nA word of warning about using Avast in particular with DetectX: last I checked, Avast flags DetectX as a threat. I believe this is due to the fact that Avast is not smart enough to recognise that DetectX contains search strings that look for adware, malware and other associated badware. Users can inspect these search strings themselves as most are in plain text in the Resources folder of the app's bundle. This is stated on the DetectX home page, and there is a link there to further info about problems with Avast. All other reputable AV software recognises DetectX as safe. \nPlease contact me through the website if you haver further questions about DetectX. \n\nA: Assuming you downloaded DetectX via the author's own website, there seems to be no cause for concern. Like you, I can find no reports of the application causing problems in the five years it has been available, and nothing about the developer's Twitter account looks suspicious. On his own website, the DetectX author also lists the manual steps needed to remove MacKeeper, so you can at least verify that it has correctly done that.\n\nA: If you try to get rid of Mackeeper by finding the hidden files with DetectX be careful about deleting everything found . for me, Mackeeper moved all my files and then hid them from me. I was mad and I used DetectX to find the stuff. I couldn't delete Mackeeper stuff fast enough, however, unfortunately I deleted all my files without knowing it. I should have been more deliberate, paying closer attention to my actions as I could have prevented this, however I was so mad at how Mackeeper changed everything about my system behavior that I overlooked the warning about how Mackeeper moves your stuff to a hidden file. I should have recovered my stuff first. I had to buy more software to recover things from my hard drive in the deleted trash. Needless to say there was some loss but I was able to recover lots of stuff but it was in mangled order and some files were incomplete. Be careful using powerful tools. I dont blame DetectX for this.\n", "Q: ipod touch locked all the way cant get in at all I bought a ipod i tried contacting the owner i tried everything but there apple id and password is on the ipod i cant login or try to set it up for me becuase it says its linked to an apple id but the person i bought it from isnt answering my calls and i cant get in the ipod how do i get in it is there any other way????? any website ideas anything? i payed 200.oo i really need help geeting into the ipod a differnt way they basicly put find my iphone on the device\n\nA: You can erase your iPod in recovery mode using iTunes.

(The MacBook Bluetooth is OK as I can connect to other devices.)\nThe MacBook sees it, and says \"connecting\" when I press the pair control, but always fails with Couldn't connect to the device.\nI have always found this device frustrating; it came with almost no instructions and there seems to be no on-line manual, although there is a similar keyboard with 3 batteries rather than 2.\nWhen I press the power the green light comes on for a few seconds then goes off.\nI possible broke it by attempting to connect without pairing from the new device.\nIs there anyway I can reset the keyboard to factory default.\n\nA: That's actually a feature, albeit a very poorly documented one.\nThe Apple Wireless Keyboard refuses attempts to be overtaken by a different host without a deliberate disconnect, physical access by the user, a very long timeout or a manual reset.\nYour keyboard model is that of \"October 2009\", the manual can be found here: https://manuals.info.apple.com/MANUALS/1000/MA1208/en_US/Apple_Wireless_Keyboard_2009_UG.pdf\nPage 6 states that you should disconnect (not unpair) your keyboard before connecting (or pairing) it to another computer.\nOnce the keyboard is no longer in a 'connected' state, it will happily reconnect to any device it has previously been paired to.\nSo in order to resolve your problem, you should either take your keyboard back to the computer it believes to be connected to (and explicitly disconnect it there) or try the following in order to disconnect it manually:\n\n\n*\n\n*open the \"Keyboard\" pane in \"System Preferences\" and choose \"Set Up Bluetooth Keyboard...\" (or search for devices via the \"Bluetooth\" pane as an alternative), \n\n*power off your keyboard by pressing and holding the power button (on its side),\n\n*release the power button after the indicator light goes out (your keyboard is now in standby mode),\n\n*press and hold the (same) power button for as long as it takes for your keyboard to be successfully connected by your target computer (the indicator light will blink during the course of this step).\n\n\n \nIn case you release the power button too early, i.e. without fully establishing a connection, the keyboard will simply fall back into the mode it was before – still connected to the other computer, safe from being overtaken. :)\n\nA: I had to hold down the keyboard power button while pressing Pair on the mac to get this working. Thanks for the tutorial!\n", "Q: Will Time Machine store the same data twice in this situation? I had 80 GB of movies on my internal HDD. Time Machine backed them up to an external HDD, along with everything else on my drive.\nI then moved those movies to another external HDD (which is not being backed up). The movies were kept in the TM backup as there was still space on the backup drive.\nIf I move these files back to (another partition on) the internal HDD (which is included in TM Backups), they will be backed up by TM. But being that the exact same data is already stored on the TM drive, is TM going to be smart enough to realize this? It wouldn't need to take another 80 GB on the drive, it could just hotlink to the existing files (until changes happen, of course). This is what it does for the \"past\" backups when they don't differ from the current version of a file (otherwise the backup drive would get full very fast).\nDoes TM have any such space saving feature for when the exact same data is backed up from different directories?\n\nA: No, if you move the files back to another location on the disk backed up by Time Machine, the next backup will create a new copy of these files on your backup volume. This may even occur if you put them back into the same place (because the files will get a new creation timestamp which AFAIK triggers Time Machine to create a new file on the backup drive).\nWhat you can do though is to navigate to the folder which originally contained the movies, open Time Machine from there, navigate back in time until the movies are displayed and then delete all backed up versions of them.\n\nA: If a file had \"left\" the drive and came back there is clearly no way to determine it was the same file, short of doing a scan of the file. For an in-place directory move, Time Machine apparently doesn't track unix \"inode\" numbers for saving copy time and space. There is probably no point 99% of the cases. You can demonstrate this by looking at the Unix \"inode\" numbers on the source drive then on the Time Machine pseudo-disk to see if the new backup was a different file.\nOriginal:\n89192258 -rw-r--r--@ 1 me  _lpoperator  352 Jun 10 17:29 /Users/me/Test.rtf\nMoved:\n89192258 -rw-r--r--@ 1 me  _lpoperator  352 Jun 10 17:29 /Users/me/Downloads/Test.rtf\nTime Machine Pass 1:  /Users/me/Test.rtf\n6496652 -rw-r--r--@   2 me  _lpoperator   352 Jun 10 17:29 Test.rtf\nTime Machine Pass 2: After the file was moved to another directory /Users/me/Downloads/Test.rtf\n6501059 -rw-r--r--@  1 me  _lpoperator  352 Jun 10 17:29 Test.rtf\nThe \"inode\" numbers are the first entry.

When I've downloaded a file in Chrome for OS X, it sits in a little bar at the bottom of the screen.\nSometimes I want to drag and drop that file directly into a Chrome tab (for example, to upload it somewhere.)\nSome websites allow this.\nOther websites, however, won't allow this. They only accept files from Finder, not ones dragged directly from the downloads bar.\nHow can I get Chrome and/or OS X to treat these files from the downloads bar as normal Finder files, so that websites will be unable to differentiate?\nI realize that I could, (and I in fact do), just locate the file in Finder and drag it from there. However, I do this often and it would save me time if I could just drag it directly from Chrome itself.\n\nA: Holding the alt or option key while doing the Drag & Drop action works.\nI think since Chrome also handles webpages as links (html) to open them in the browser, it does the same for downloaded files. If you simply hold alt while clicking a link it also downloads the file. So I assume Chrome treats the downloaded \"link\" as a 'file' when holding that key. \nYou could also use cmd + Click to \"Show In Finder\"\n", "Q: Delete last word using Command + Backspace Is there a setting to delete the last word using the command key and backspace?\nCurrently this combination of keys deletes the current line.

Is there a setting or a terminal command to run?\n\nA: \"without drag lock\" is the correct setting for this – however, the drag lock only turns off after a half-second of inactivity, to make sure that the drag is finished. So, you must wait just a bit before touching the trackpad again.\nYou can also tap once at the end of your drag to release the drag lock.\nIf you use the \"three finger drag\" setting, no delay is required to move the cursor with a single finger.\n\nA: You can try installing \"BetterTouchTools\" which removes the delay completely along with allowing you to add your own gestures.\n\nA: Simply run defaults write 'Apple Global Domain' com.apple.springing.delay 0 in terminal\n", "Q: Add a caption to an image Need a simple program to add captions to lots of images (Several 1000 - for a hobby website).

Beyond that, the requirements\n  are pretty soft and forgiving.\n\nHere is my output from the System Profiler:\n\nHardware Overview:\nModel Name:   MacBook Pro\n  Model Identifier: MacBookPro2,2\n  Processor Name:   Intel Core 2 Duo\n  Processor Speed:  2.33 GHz\n  Number Of Processors: 1\n  Total Number Of Cores:    2\n  L2 Cache: 4 MB\n  Memory:   3 GB\n  Bus Speed:    667 MHz\n  Boot ROM Version: MBP22.00A5.B07\n  SMC Version (system): 1.12f5\n  Serial Number (system):   W86432AEW0L\n  Hardware UUID:    00000000-0000-1000-8000-0017F2C54B21\n  Sudden Motion Sensor:   State:    Enabled\n\nSo my computer meets the tech specs, but it is a year older than the oldest stated supported model. Practically speaking, what is the latest Mac OS version this computer will be able to run?\n\nA: MacTracker says this version MacBookPro2,2 can have Mac OS X 10.7.5 as maximum OS.\nAs 10.7.5 needs at least 2GB memory and you have 3GB, I think you would have no problem upgrading to 10.7.5.\n", "Q: Does 'family sharing' require that members use same apple ID for both iTunes and iCloud? Each member of our family has two unique Apple ID's, one for use with iTunes and another for iCloud (e.g. 4 members, 8 Apple ID's). On the family sharing page it says \"Family Sharing requires a personal Apple ID signed in to iCloud and iTunes\". We are hoping to achieve not only the shared apps functionality of 'family sharing' but also the shared calendar, photos and Apple music subscription.\nDoes this mean that each of us has to use the Apple ID's for our personal iCloud accounts to signin to itunes if we want to use 'family sharing'? i.e. we have to use the same Apple ID for iTunes and iCloud?\n\nA: To use Family Sharing, you need to have the same Apple ID on both iCloud and iTunes.  It looks to me like you'll need to decide which Apple ID's your family wants to use and stick with that.\nOn a side note, I don't understand why you'd want to have seperate ID's for each service.  I'm sure you have a good reason but I would strongly recommend using only 1 ID for everything Apple. \n", "Q: Installing Google Maps without an Apple ID? Is it possible to install Google Maps without an Apple ID?\n\nA: No, Apple requires that–for apps on iOS from the App Store–you register for an Apple ID. This is by design, so you must create an Apple ID if you wish to download any app.\n", "Q: OSX DPI scaling Windows has a feature that can make text and GUI objects larger by changing a DPI setting. This helps keeping the monitors native resolution, but still make text and objects larger on screen. \nIs there a similar feature on OSX? I'd like things to be more readable but avoid blurring when choosing a different scaled resolution.\n\nA: That's not possible until now. Apple tried to implement an resolution independent UI in the past but removed it when the first Retina Macs came out.\n\nA: OS/X has high-DPI functionality too, but Apple seems to have decided to disable it for non-Apple display hardware.\nA number of places around the web seem to claim that you can re-enable it with the command below, but this has not worked for me and my 4K TV.\nsudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.windowserver.plist DisplayResolutionEnabled -bool true\n\n", "Q: Connect Windows 7 Laptop to Mac mini I have a Mac mini and a Windows 7 laptop.  I want to control the Mac mini through my Windows laptop.  Is there any solution in a way that I don't have to hook up the Mac with a monitor, keyboard, and mouse every time I want to connect?\n\nA: I have a similar scenario in that I need to access a Linux system on my LAN from my MacBook Pro, so I use the free version of NoMachine. It's available for Windows, Linux and OS X.\nYou first have to hook up a monitor, keyboard, and mouse to get NoMachine installed and configured on the Mac and then connect at least once from the Windows system.  You could then shutdown the Mac mini, unplug monitor, keyboard, and mouse and then restart the Mac mini.  I'm assuming you also have it set to auto login.\nIt would need to be installed on both the Windows and Mac systems.\n", "Q: How to disable \"turn off display after\" when using Apple TV? I have my Energy Saver->Battery->'Turn display off after:\" set to 2 minutes. This setting is exactly how I want power settings to behave when I'm using the computer on my lap. However, when I hook up to Apple TV for a presentation it still shuts off after 2 minutes which disconnects apple TV and disrupts the presentation. \nIs there a way to have a different Energy Saver setting when using Apple TV (or other external monitor)? I frequently switch between using Apple TV and not to the point that changing Energy Saver every time is a burden. \nUsing a 2015 Macbook Pro on El Capitan.\n\nA: You can keep your Mac on forever when you need to (including while AirPlaying) without digging into settings if you download the Mac app Amphetamine. With Amphetamine, a button will appear on your Mac's menu bar. Just click it to prevent your Mac from sleeping indefinitely, and click it again to allow it to sleep. This is a very simple method of keeping your Mac on forever, especially useful while downloading a large file or—like you're doing—AirPlaying.\nAlternatively, you can use macOS's built-in command line tool caffeinate to keep your Mac awake for longer periods.\n\nA: Try something like this:\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/app/amphetamine/id937984704?mt=12\nWith just a click you can keep the display on for a set or indefinite amount of time.\n", "Q: MacBook software speaker problem I've found that the speakers on my 2008 Core 2 Duo MacBook aren't being used by Mac OS X.

(A command-line program would be great.)\nIs that possible? Similar questions have been asked before, but as far as I can tell, the best answer given has been PDFOutliner, which is not freeware.\n\nA: I found PDFtk Server and Coherent PDF Command Line Tools have a wide range of PDF command line utilities.\nI've used both tools on and off, but never needed to do any TOC work. The Bookmarks section in Coherent's Usage Examples Page looks like it may be an approach to experiment with:\n6. Bookmarks\ncpdf -list-bookmarks in.pdf\nList the bookmarks in in.pdf.

My app has always(4 months) been free and I am wondering if I make it paid, will it be in the new paid apps category?\nIt is not new in sense of app but new in sense of paid app.\n\nA: That's up to Apple.  They decide what apps to feature.  The App Store gets thousands of new/updated apps every day and not every new app will be featured.  If your app provides some special service or interesting presentation, it's possible your app will be featured.\n", "Q: Contacts from Address Book Disappeared I just installed El Capitan (I used to have Lion OS X), and I lost my address book.

Thank you.\n\nA: If your contacts were connected to an account (e.g., iCloud or Exchange), you may need to re-authenticate after an OS upgrade. Go to System Preferences > Internet Accounts and make sure Contacts for the account you use is checked.\n\nA: I had the same problem and found my data appeared instantly when I disabled facebook's Card DAV account in preferences. \n", "Q: Is it possible to create a service using only the shell and bypassing automator altogether? Using automator is somewhat of a tedious task. Using the shell in the Terminal is much easier all around. Even using the \"Run Shell Script\" action inside automator is not the same as using the actual shell in the Terminal. A script that works normally in the Terminal may break in Automator. Then editing requires opening Automator again (I have a habit of quitting the program assuming everything will work) and waiting on everything to load. So I thought, why am I even using this program? But then when I start thinking about creating a service, I realized that I have no idea how to go about it without the slow and clunky Automator application. Is this even possible?  \n\nA: Having read through the Services Implementation Guide I'm going to have to say no to using only a shell script.  If you do not want to use Automator then you'll have to create a Service using Xcode and unless you can perform that level of programming, then Automator, as slow and clunky as it may be, is looking pretty good.\nJust for the heck of it, I took what I learned from reading the Services Implementation Guide and was able to manually wrap the shell script in an application bundle with an appropriate Info.plist file that did make an entry on the Services menu in Finder as I coded in the .plist file. However, that's were things stopped as there was no mechanism within to pass what was selected in Finder to the shell script, masquerading as a Service in this case, like what the Automator Service takes care of automatically without one having to resort to Xcode.\nIn closing... Automator, as slow and clunky as it may be, is the easiest way to create a Service for the non-programmer average everyday user of OS X.\n", "Q: Upgrading one partition to El Capitan while leaving the other on Mountain Lion We have an iMac that is barely still compatible with El Capitan. Right now it runs Mountain Lion okay, and actually it has a smaller partition on the hard drive for another clean installation of Mountain Lion that we don't really use.\nI have an El Capitan boot USB drive and an El Capitan install app, and I was thinking about using one of those to upgrade the clean install partition to El Capitan to see how it performs, but I'm hesitant and want to make sure things wouldn't be messed up.\nSo first of all, does this sound like a good idea? Second, would it be better to boot into the USB drive and choose to install to the clean install partition or should I put the install app on the clean install's Application's folder and run it from there?\nAlso would doing this risk causing the Mountain Lion restore partition to be deleted? Are there risks of things being messed up, not being able to make Mountain Lion the default boot partition, or other weird things El Capitan would do to the main partition?\n\n\nA: Yes, you can go ahead and  install El Capitan to the smaller partition. \nYou just need to run the \"Install OS X El Capitan\" application and select the proper destination volume. I would first use the Disk Utility application to erase this destination volume. You do not have to use a USB drive to install El Capitan.\nDuring the installation, the Recovery volume following destination volume will be update with the proper code. The Recover volume for Mountain Lion will be unchanged. The result will be two different Recover volumes on your internal disk. Each will be given a different label so you can tell them apart.\nDuring the installation, I was not asked, if I wanted to use Core Storage. In the event, you are asked, the answer should be No.\n\nI verified this procedure by running the \"Install OS X El Capitan\" application from an internal Yosemite volume. I installed El Capitan to an external drive. The Yosemite volume was unchanged by the procedure.\n\nI also have had Yosemite and El Capitan installed in different volumes on my internal drive for some time now. You can switch operating systems by selecting the Startup Disk in System Preferences.\n", "Q: How to reach full resolution potential with MacBook Pro 2012?

I don't believe that I created it, but it doesn't seem that it comes by default because there is nothing in it. The folder I'm referring to is the one titled Data in case that was not clear. Thanks for any ideas you may have.\n\n\nA: If you have a backup, then go ahead and delete the folder. You are correct that it's not something Apple installs. Lots of third party database software like mongodb work best with a /data mount point - so if you can correlate the creation date on that folder with running an install script or package you might be able to infer which process created that folder.\nThere isn't an auditing system you can read to determine when or what installed a change generally - so use Finder to get information on the folder or perhaps try a tool like Pacifist to check receipts - maybe you will be lucky with a package claiming the creation of that /Data directory.\n", "Q: ~/Pictures Bloated Size I am planning on backing up my pictures\nWhen I got to ~/Pictures it shows 168.57GB Size and then two libraries iPhoto and photos as shown below.\n\n\nI thought these were just links so total of all my pictures should be just around approx 90GB but not 168.57.\nSo now if I backup ~/Pictures to an external Drive is it going to consume 168.57GB and have duplicates?\nPlease suggest if I am thinking incorrectly.\n\nA: The image files (the jpgs) exist only once but are hard linked into both libraries. As the Finder doesn't have an (easy) way to identify the hard linking, calculating folder size on ~/Pictures counts these files twice.\nHard links work within one disk volume only, so if you copy data to a Cloud drive or to Windows, you will end up having two seperate files (and really use 168 GB in your case).\n", "Q: Push photo from MacBook to iPhone via USB I can drag and drop an image from a folder on my MacBook into Photos.

When I hit on photos icon the heading is \"Moments\" therefore I am not sure if this is a camera roll or what.\nI wish to delete all photos on my iPhone and iPad to free up space but have them remain on my iMac.  I connected the phone to the Mac to upload my latest photos/videos.  However when I hit the bin icon I receive the msg: This photo will be deleted from iCloud Photo Library on all your devices. \nOther possible relevant info: I have iCloud Drive 'On' on my phone and iCloud Photo Library 'On' on phone.  On my iMac I am signed in to iCloud Drive on my iMac which is running OS X El Capitan V10.11.4. \n\nA: You can achieve this in two ways:\n\n\n*\n\n*Deactivating the \"iCloud Photo Library\", which links the photo libraries in every iOS / OS X device you own and have configured under the same Apple ID and automatically syncs every picture taken, added or removed to all the devices on the system. With the setting inactive, you can work in the \"classic\" way, by downloading the images of each device to your main library and then emptying your iOS devices. You won't get the alert because the libraries will no longer be synced.\n\n*Keeping the iCloud Photo Library on and activating the \"Optimize [device] storage\" setting under Settings > iCloud > iCloud Photo Library which will keep a full resolution copy of your image on iCloud and on the devices that don't have this setting on –your Mac, probably– and leave a lower resolution copy on your phone or any device with the setting activated. A higher resolution copy will be downloaded on demand if you open the picture later on.\n\n\n\nCheck the explanation Apple gives on the matter here: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204264\nIt's important to note that this will change the experience when browsing pictures on the Photo app a little bit, as each time you look at a picture in full screen it will begin downloading a bigger copy which will have a little delay; expect an increased use of your bandwidth and depending on your settings, of your data plan. Also, depending on the size of your Photo Library, you may fill the 5GB free plan and be asked to pay a monthly fee for an increase in your iCloud capacity.\n", "Q: Automatically make QuickTime fullscreen when opened Question above. I often use QuickTime for watching video tutorials, but I want to be able to start it in fullscreen automatically.\n\nA: QuickTime Player doesn't have a Preferences... menu command like other applications do, nor does it have a com.apple.quicktime.plist file to manipulate. Therefore there isn't anything you can do directly, however here is a workaround of sorts.\nNote that this workaround requires changing the default application for file types, e.g. .mov, you'd normally open directly with QuickTime Player to the application created herein, called: QTP Full Screen.app\nUsing Automator create a new Application and add a Run Shell Script Action.\nChange: Pass input: [to stdin] to [as argument]\nAdd the following code:\nif [[ ! -z $1 ]]; then\n\n    open -a \"QuickTime Player\" \"$1\"\n\n    osascript -e 'tell application \"QuickTime Player\" to activate' \\\n              -e 'delay 1.5' \\\n              -e 'tell application \"System Events\" to keystroke \"f\" using command down' \\\n              -e 'delay 1.5' \\\n              -e 'tell application \"QuickTime Player\" to play front document'\nfi\n\n\nSave it as an Application named: QTP Full Screen\nIn order for QTP Full Screen to be the global default app for, e.g. .mov, files you'd open in QuickTime Player you'll have to use the Default Apps Preference Pane, RCDefaultApp by Rubicode to change which application opens a given Extension.\nInstall RCDefaultApp and then in System Preferences > Default Apps select the Extensions tab and scroll down to mov and then change the Default Application: to: QTP Full Screen\nNow then you double-click .mov files in Finder or accessing them from Spotlight the QTP Full Screen application will open the target file in Quick Time Player, set View to Full Screen and start playing the file.\nNote: If you do not want it to automatically start playing the file then remove the line of code, the one that has \"play front document\" in it.\nIf you need modify other default methods of file types, Apps, URLs, UTIs, etc. the Default Apps Preference Pane, RCDefaultApp by Rubicode, is a great utility for it.\nTo make the QTP Full Screen.app application bundle look better in the Applications folder you can copy and paste the QuickTime Player.app application icon from its Get Info sheet to the icon of the Get Info sheet for QTP Full Screen.app.\nNote:  The value of the delay statements can be adjusted in seconds and or decimal fractions thereof, as might be necessary on any given system to account for its processing speed. \n\nA: You could simply press the ⌘ Cmd  F key as a shortcut to go to full screen. I don't think that Quicktime has any settings that support this feature natively, and it's not too difficult to press the shortcut every time you watch a video. \nOtherwise you could make an an automator as suggested here: https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/208399/183022 \n", "Q: Two mouses one Mac Remember this old Easter egg from Google link.\nI want to know: is it possible to have the cursors from two mouses on one Mac?

Although technically possible to connect multiple pointing devices (USB mouses, Bluetooth mouses, trackpads, rollerballs, etc.) so far as I can tell, OS X presents only one cursor for all connected devices. This posting at SuperUser discusses this question, and one answer points to this software as a possible solution.

(Have seen other older answers but no solutions recently.)\n\nA: Try to disable mirroring in System Preferences > Displays and move application which play video to the screen you want.\n", "Q: Install InkScape without XQuartz Is it possible to install InkScape without XQuartz?\nI did install it already and it's working but I feel like it's not that native (e.g. the menu doesn't appear on the top pannel but until the title bar).\nHow to install InkScape without XQuartz?\n\nA: Inkscape 1.0 will include first class support for Mac OS X with no need for XQuartz.\nIf you are willing to try alpha software, you can download a dmg right now from https://inkscape.org/release/inkscape-1.0/?latest=1 by clicking on the Mac OS X and then choose Apple's Mac OS X Desktop.\nOr click, A build from the CI build Alpha Tarball to build from the command line.\n\nA: Since some time has passed, I thought it might be good to post an update:\nYES\nYou can now install Inkscape from a Disk Image (.dmg) file, and there is no need to run it through XQuartz. Rejoice!\nThe current version as of this writing is 1.2.1 (download link)\nThere are two installers, one for Intel Macs, and one for ARM64 Macs.\n\nFor anyone unsure of their processor type, check here: \n\nThe installer has a nice little splash screen. Installation is drag-and-drop. It all feels very familiar to a Mac user, and there's no hassle at all.\n\nThe first time you launch Inkscape, there is a screen to assist with the initial settings:\n\nAnd it's as simple as that to get started.\nIn my experience so far there have been a couple of quirks with keyboard shortcuts not being what one might expect.\nHide Inkscape (expecting CmdH, has no shortcut assigned, and while normally you can assign one, and I did try, it does not respond except while accessing one of Inkscape's menu items using the mouse).\nAlso, when the menu shows a keyboard shortcut containing +, what is meant is literally Shift=, not the Apple convention of listing all modifier keys like Shift explicitly. This means if you see Cmd+, translate that as CmdShift=.\nBut these are small issues, and the current Inkscape offers considerable improvements over previous versions, beginning with a nice new polished interface.\n\nA: Not officially possible, yet—the Inkscape developers will have to remove the XQuartz dependency by switching to the native Gtk and Glib libraries for OS X, just like the GIMP team did a few years ago. \nThis work has been in progress for a couple of years on a separate Inkscape branch, but there is no official release yet. However, you can download the latest DMG here (currently based on Inkscape 0.91) both for GTK2 and GTK3 (experimental), at your own risk—expect bugs and crashes.\n", "Q: iCloud storage always full I am clearly missing some with iCloud storage, every few weeks I get an email saying my storage is nearly full and I only have a couple of hundred MB left. So I am always deleting my back up and letting it back up overnight. When I back it up it's only about 3GB. Why is it consistently over the weeks always full? I have no apps being backed up to it either, they're all off. So how do I stop this and what is causing it?\nHere is an example of what I mean. It backed up yesterday. I have all the apps off and it wants to back up another 192MB. I haven't sent s load of images in iMessage or anything like this in the last day so I don't know where the data is coming from. I don't take many photos anyway so it's not photos. Unless it has anything to do with Apple Watch? I can't see or find anything about activity app being backed up the cloud, but that's the only thing left I can think of\n\n\nA: Go to Settings > General > Storage & iCloud Usage. Under the iCloud section, tap Manage Storage. This will show you everything that is using space in your iCloud account. If you see something you do not want backing up to iCloud, then disable and delete it here. iCloud Photo Library may be the culprit.\nOn the bottom of this page you can also select Change Storage Plan to purchase additional storage; in the US, the $0.99/month plan gives you 50 GB, which should be plenty for you.\n\nA: \nUnless it has anything to do with Apple Watch? I can't see or find\nanything about activity app being backed up the cloud, but that's the\nonly thing left I can think of\n\nThe extra backup space is definitely from the watch.\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204518\n\nHere's what your Apple Watch backup will include:\nApp-specific data (for built-in apps) and settings (for built-in and third-party apps), such as Maps, distance, and units\nGeneral system settings, such as your watch face, known Wi-Fi\nnetworks, brightness, sound, and haptic settings\nHealth and Fitness data, such as history, achievements, Workout and Activity calibration data from your Apple Watch, and user-entered data\n(To back up Health and Fitness data, you need to use iCloud or an\nencrypted iTunes backup.)\nLanguage\nSettings for Mail, Calendar, Stocks, and Weather\nTime Zone\n\n", "Q: How to configure browser used by web page Reminders? How can I change which browser the Mac Reminders.app uses to open \"this webpage\" associations for a Reminder, so I can change the \"Open Google Chrome Canary\" notification button to an \"Open Mozilla Firefox\" button?\nGiven I've created a Reminder for a Webpage on my phone by asking Siri to \"remind me about this tomorrow\", when the Reminder appears on my laptop running the latest public build of OS X, then I expect the Open button to offer to open it in my default browser, or just not mention the browser and behave as open(1) does.\nInstead, what I see is \"Open in Google Chrome Canary\":\n\nThis has me flummoxed: I open that browser like once a year, and my default browser is Mozilla Firefox. I've no clue why Reminders has latched onto it as The Chosen Browser for webpage reminders.\nETA: I have deleted Google Chrome Canary. After relaunching Reminders.app, webpage reminders show, instead of its icon, the \"invalid app\" default icon with slashed-circle. Clicking that button does nothing. No console logs appear. \n\nA: My results from user edgarator’s solution: Successful for macOS Safari users\nSummary\n\n\n*\n\n*Chrome icon changed to Safari after CleanMyMac Chrome Uninstall\n\n*Chrome icon appears again after Chrome is reinstalled\n\n*Removing files individually still had the Chrome icon, resulting in “no effect”\n\n*Firefox will open Reminders URL’s if it is set as the default web browser.\n\n*Firefox can’t share websites to Reminders. \n\n*Firefox can’t use Siri to send websites to Reminders. \n\n\nSoftware Versions\n\n\n*\n\n*macOS Sierra:         10.12.6\n\n*Apple Reminders:      4.0 (441.11)\n\n*CleanMyMac:           1.10.4\n\n*Google Chrome:        61.0.3163.79 (Official Build) (64-bit)\n\n*Safari:               10.1.2 (12603.3.8)\n\n*Firefox:              55.0.3 (64-bit)\n\n\nMy Process\nSafari’s has a share website to Reminders feature (Share-to-Reminders).  Details can be added to a website reminder that is being sent to Reminders without leaving the browser.  \nNow the problem: The shared links in Reminders uses Chrome icons which open Reminders items in Chrome, instead of Safari—or a designated browser.\n\nI used CleanMyMac to uninstall Google Chrome, it's folders, and files.\nAfter uninstalling Chrome, it's icon was replaced by Safari’s icon, pressing on the icon opened the link in Safari.\n\nI then changed the default web browser to Firefox.  \nClicking on the URL’s directly, or Control-clicking the URL’s in the Info Pane, opens the link in Firefox (default browser).  \nHowever, Firefox does not support Share-to-Reminders, so websites can’t be shared to Reminders from Firefox.  This also means that Siri does not execute the Share-to-Reminders command while using Firefox.  \n\nA: CleanMyMac 3 has a feature called \"Rebuild Launch Services Database\", which fixed the issue for me, resetting the browser from Chrome to Safari.\n\nA: I had the same problem (but wanted Safari to be the default) and found that un-registering and re-registering Safari with Launch Services got me the desired result:\n/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Versions/A/Support/lsregister -u /Applications/Safari.app\n/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Versions/A/Support/lsregister /Applications/Safari.app\nReplace /Applications/Safari.app with your desired browser.\n\nA: Try deleting these files:\n\n\n*\n\n*~/Library/Preferences/com.google.Chrome.plist\n\n*~/Library/Preferences/com.google.Keystone.Agent.plist\n\n*~/Library/Saved Application State/com.google.Chrome.savedState\n\n*/private/var/folders/5g/h3jsl4892418tz23ttcms4p80000gn/C/com.google.Chrome\n\n*~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome\n\n*~/Library/Caches/com.google.Keystone.Agent\n\n*~/Library/Caches/Google/Chrome\n\n*~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.google.keystone.agent.plist\n\n*~/Library/Google/Google Chrome Brand.plist\n\n*~/Library/Google/GoogleSoftwareUpdate\nNot sure which one, but one of those fixes the problem.

Rerun the memory diagnostic software and/or AHT and see if the error persists.  Make a note of the address where it fails.\nThen, remove that stick, and replace with another and repeat the test.  Keep the failed memory sticks off to one side so you know which one failed.  \nIf all fail in the same address, chances are it's your logic board.  If only one fails at a particular address, it's that module.  You'll have to replace it.\nUpdate:\n(Given that it passed on the first go round after removing one of the modules) \nI did some quick research on your particular Macbook Pro and according to EveryMac.com, while you have an official limit of 8GB, you can actually install a max of 16GB.  \n\nSince you have the machine open now's a good opportunity to upgrade to the max because the prices are quite good.  I have reccomended this particular memory kit to someone with your model Macbook just recently.\n\nA: When rember repeatedly flags memory as failing, it might be time for a repair or swap of the memory if it’s removable.\nThat tool won’t always find a problem if you have a memory failure, but when it finds an error, it’s almost always right. So the false negative chances are low but the false positive chances are so close to zero that you should look to repair next instead of more testing.\n", "Q: How to double \"iPhone is Disabled\" timer? So, someone showed me a secret with the iPhone that if you enter a certain pin on the lockscreen, the iPhone will be disabled for double the amount of time. I've been searching on Google trying to find this, but I can't find anything about this. I'm kinda skeptical and I would like to know if this even exists, and maybe any other secret pin combinations that can be entered that affect the disabling of the iPhone in some way.\nHonestly, I do not promote theft or anything of that nature, I would actually like to try these things on my old iPhone for fun.\n\nA: There are no secret passcode combinations to do that with original firmware from Apple. You can only find a way to tweak it after jailbreak your iPhone.\n", "Q: SD slot for mac mini Last year I purchased a Mac Mini from MacMall. It came without a manual or  instructions.  I'm trying to find a slot in the back to install a SanDisk card to view pictures off a trail cam. The slots will not take the card directly.  Yesterday I drove 50 miles to a Best Buy and purchased an Insignia adaptor which the salesman assured me would fit any computer made. There are only two tiny slots at the back of the mac mini and the Insignia adaptor is too large to fit into either of them. Can any one offer me some advice or must I assume the mac mini will not take any SD card.  Ron\n\nA: The Mac mini, since Mid 2011, has one Secure Digital (SDXC) card slot.  Prior to that, the Mid 2010 models have one Secure Digital (SD) card slot and prior to 2010 the Mac mini has no card slot.\nBack side of Mac mini (Late 2014):\n\nIf the flash memory card is a micro card, then to use the SD/SDXC card slot, you need an SD card Adapter as shown in the example image below.\n\nIf you do not want to use the SD card slot then you'll need a USB SD Card Reader. As an example, the Insignia™ - USB 2.0 SD/MMC Memory Card Reader - Black, which is compatible with, SD, SDHC, SDXC, microSD, microSDHC, microSDXC, MMC and MMC+ memory cards on PC and Mac, shown in the image below.\n\n\nA: Thank you for responding to my question. You have the right \"insignia\" adaptor above.  how the back of my 2015 Mac Mini does not look anything\nlike the picture posted above.  Where the SDXC card slot is shown on the above picture, my Mac Mini has the power cord. Once again, I can not find a slot that the insignia adaptor will slide into. \n", "Q: Does an iPhone require the users password after being reset via the \"search my iPhone\" utility? I wanted to sell my old broken iPhone but was reluctant because of the data stored on it. I couldn't reset it because it wouldn't power on. So the buyer said I could just reset it via the utility so it would reset itself once it went online. I did that but now the guy (who repaired it) says I would need to enter my password corresponding to my Apple ID one more time in order for him to use the phone after the reset. Is it true or is he trying to scam me?\n\nA: It is a feature called activation lock\nClick for more info\nI would suggest changing your Apple ID password to something simple then after about 5 minutes change it back\n\nA: The answer depend on how you use your iPhone. In this case, you said \"reset it via the utility so it would reset itself once it went online. I did that\" do you mention about erase data option on iCloud webpage? If yes then the answer is YES, the phone do require your password to pass Activation Lock.\n", "Q: Is Whited00r safe? If I use it to install iOS 7, can I restore to iOS 4? I have the iPod 2nd gen and it is pretty much useless as I cannot update to IOS 7 from 4.2, BUT there is this program called whited00r which lets you update to IOS 7. Apparently it has worked with people- so, is it safe and if I do install IOS 7 and it doesnt work, can I revert back to IOS 4?  \n\nA: Whited00r is not iOS 7. It just looks and feels like iOS 7. You won't be able to install iOS 7 applications or have access to many of the features of iOS 7. You're still running iOS 4 under the hood, and all you have to do is restore in iTunes if you don't like it.\n", "Q: Is there a way to read/respond to iPhone text messages on a Windows computer? I would like to be able to read/respond to my text messages on a computer.  I only seem to find a place to do this if you have a Mac.  Can this be done on a Windows computer or Chromebooks running Chrome OS?\n\nA: No, you can only use iMessages on iOS and Mac OS devices.\n", "Q: How is the iOS App Store Updates list organized? I have dozens of apps in my iOS App Store that have updates available, but I have no interest in updating most of them. There are certain apps though that if an update were available I would want to install it. But I can't find any rhyme or reason to how the updates are sorted in that section of the App Store app which makes it harder for me to see if something is available short of slowly scrolling through the whole list or searching for that app directly.\nSo how are they organized?\n\nA: Not to be flippant but I don't think anyone outside of Apple knows.  I've had Apple products for years and my only guess is they're rolled out within a specific time after their review has completed.  We don't know when the apps are reviewed, except for our own, so we don't know how we stack-up against the other apps that have been updated.\n\nA: I'm just going to say it's random. I've tried looking at it across various ways it could be sorted, there's no organization. I've updated all apps and watched new updates come in, and when another app has a new update available, there is no way to predict where in the list of updates it will show up.\nHowever, in the updates section for iOS apps in iTunes, they appear to be sorted alphabetically with sort options. Hopefully that will be extended to iOS in the future.\n", "Q: your iCloud music library session has expired After deciding I dont want Apple managing any of my music through iCloud I decided to log out of iTunes. Now I am constantly getting an annoying message from iTunes that says:\nyour iCloud music library session has expired \nIt's very obvious to me that it is expired, as I signed out. How can I get iTunes to stop pestering me with this reminder? I press esc or CANCEL and it comes back 2 or 3 times before it quits for about 15 minutes then asks me again. I Have to keep hitting CANCEL for it to go away.  \nRunning iTunes 12.2.3.35 on OSX 10.9.5\n\nA: I may have found an answer. Navigate to iTunes and on the top menu items navigate to the STORE tab. From there sign out of iTunes, and then log in again.\nI restarted Itunes just to double check and everything looks good. I haven't been prompted by the annoying message!\n", "Q: In Terminal I cannot type lowercase e If I open a Terminal window and I type the letter \"e\" (without quotes of course) it beeps and will not type the letter.  Every other letter works just fine in Terminal. Uppercase E works too.  Just the lowercase e doesn't.\nIn every other app on my computer lowercase e works without issue, so it's not a keyboard issue.\nThis started sometime in the last week.  I use Terminal a lot in my job and never has this been an issue.  I have rebooted (did not fix).  I have reset terminal (did not fix).\nSince I do not know the exact date when this started, I am not sure if I made any changes or installed software.  I am trying to remove anything I have installed recently.\nFYI I have tried to use the 3rd party iTerm2 and it does the same thing.\nALSO - if I paste in something with a lower e, it does same thing - will not take it.  It has to be some terminal bash config issue I would think. \nIn fact, I copied the following sense and then I pasted it in Terminal. What appears?  sns and you can hear two beeps.  \nAlso - in case it is unclear - this happens with the built-in keyboard on the MBP as well as an external keyboard.  Based on that and the pasting issue, I do not think this is a physical keyboard issue in any way.\nSpecs: 2015 MacBook Pro, fully up to date OS X\n\nA: Let's debug it.\n\n\n*\n\n*Change shells and try again. (Credit to @Kent) In terminal: \n\n\n*\n\n*$(which zsh)\n\n\n*Comment out all lines in .bash_profile, .bashrc, etc. and open a new terminal tab/window. If this resolves the issue, something being loaded into the shell environment is consuming the letter e for reasons that science may never be able to explain.\n\n*Try cating a file that contains the letter e to see if it will even display: (Credit to @techraf)\n\n\n*\n\n*Open a text editor (not terminal)\n\n*Enter some text with a few es and save file (foo.txt?)\n\n*In terminal, cat the file:\n\n\n*\n\n*cd /path/to/folder; cat foo.txt\n\n\n*If es render then the terminal can handle it, if not, then this is super weird.\n\n\n*Try applescript. (Credit to @ALX)\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Applescript editor\n\n*Create Applescript file with these contents:\ndelay 10\ntell application \"System Events\" to keystroke \"e\"\n\n\n*Execute the script file and then quickly navigate to the terminal window. In a few seconds it will virtually press the e key and hopefully show up in your terminal. This would indicate that there could be an input/device driver issue (though I am clueless as to what that might be)\nI'm not going to lie, I am absolutely fascinated by this issue and cannot wait to learn what the cause is. It's not hardware because it works in other applications, which means it's software and I cannot imagine who would swallow the letter e with code. \n\nA: I just found this thread after running into the same issue.\nTry escaping use of e by prefixing with Ctrl+v (^v).\nQuick debug\n(In Bash), bind -p |grep -iE '\"[AE]\"' shows\nbash-$ bind -p | grep -iE '\"[AE]\"'\n\"A\": self-insert\n\"E\": self-insert\n\"a\": self-insert\n\"e\": self-insert\n\nIf that last \"e\": self-insert line is missing, this solution applies.\nQuick fix\nEscape each use of e by prefixing with Ctrl+v.

They seem to have been interpreted as keybinding-aliases for readline customization.\nRemoving the lines from .inputrc, I have confirmed, solved my problem.\nThanks @user208052 for the relevant reminder to check .inputrc.\nThe shell's Readline configuration\nThe shell's bind command allows viewing and modification of Readline config. (See help bind. help is man for shell-internal commands).\nView bind -p (maybe pipe to less |less or redirect to a file > binds.txt). It \"list[s] functions and bindings in a form that can be reused as input\".\nIt has entries like \"c\": self-insert for every character in the ASCII range, so the screwed up config may replace self-insert with some other Readline function.\nIt's got some gems; viewing it just taught me that C-= (\\e=) prints possible completions, in my default configuration. It seems to show the complete current configuration of Readline for your shell...pretty useful and powerful. Good for exploring.\nEnd to end test\n\n*\n\n*e works\n\n\n*insert erroneous line in .inputrc, open new shell\n et completion-map-case on\n set completion-ignore-case on\n\n\n\n*e is apparently a no-op\n\n\n*bind -p (| grep -i '\"E\"') shows\n\n\n\n*\n\n*\"E\": self-insert,\n\n*but no \"e\": self-insert\n\n*whereas \"A\": self-insert and \"a\": self-insert are present.\n\n\nA: I'm a bit rusty, but pasting in Terminal works differently than pasting in a GUI program: each character is sent as a separate keystroke, not as a  memcopy from clipboard to app buffer. So if the \"e\" has been remapped, it will be remapped in the paste as well.\nCheck the following locations:\nSystem Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts\n~/Library/KeyBindings/KeyBindings.dict\n$ defaults read com.apple.Automator NSUserKeyEquivalents\n\nA: Something else you can try, is to set the Terminal to open up a text editor (emacs, vi, etc) when a new window is opened.  For example, in the Terminal preferences for \"Shell\", you can have it Run command such as /usr/bin/emacs.  If you can't enter e in the preference pane, then something even odder than what's been proposed so far is going on...\nWhen a new Terminal window is opened, emacs will should start, and you can try to press e etc.  I have no idea what will happen, but like @Pierce above, I'm curious as to what is possibly going on.\n\nA: Check the stty setting and make sure 'e' didn't accidentally get set as the backspace or similar.  Been there, done that.\nStty something  \\e\nWould do it\nThe recommendation to disable/comment out .bash* would also probably uncover it.\n\nA: I had the same problem which was caused by having a typo in /etc/inputrc:\net output-meta on\n\ninstead of\nset output-meta on\n\n\nA: Oddly I just had this come up running macOS 10.13.6 on a MacBook Air. One user was fine, the admin user terminal running bash would not accept the lowercase letter 'a'- not typing, not pasting, etc. Running zsh it would be fine. Other users, fine. I think this had happened before and fixed it by deleting /Users/admin/.inputrc file, and .bash_profile. I re-added them and it works. Oddly there is nothing important in these files. .inputrc is just \"set completion-ignore-case On\", and there are a couple of command line aliases in .bash_profile. Honestly something else might be up but works for now.\nI seem to remember having to delete and re-add these files over this issue. Well, these files might trigger or reset the issue at least.\n\nA: I had this same problem using Tilix, after no success using the above suggestions, I went into the Tilix preferences and then into Shortcuts. At the very bottom of the list, it has \"Profile, Default\" and the Shortcut K was E (actually lowercase e), I changed that to Z and now I could type the lower case e, but not lower case z, so I reset the Shortcut again to Ctrl+Alt+E and this solved my problem.\n\nA: Just delete .inputrc file, it's in root directory. (It's a hidden file).\n", "Q: How to fix Thunderbolt to Gigabit Ethernet slower than Wi-Fi Macbook Pro? I recently bought a Thunderbolt to Gigabit Ethernet adapter so I could have faster Internet. I plugged the cable into my Internet modem, and the other end into my adapter. I plugged the adapter into one of my Thunderbolt ports on my Macbook Pro running OSX 10.11.3 El Capitan. The computer recognized it and connected to Ethernet. When I used speedtest.net, my WiFi had a lower ping and higher upload and download speeds than my Ethernet. I tried the cable to both Thunderbolt ports, all the ports on my modem, and my router, and even tried using a different Ethernet cable; it just wouldn't go faster on Ethernet. \nI tried resetting my PRAM (Which has recently been changed to NVRAM, but is essentially the same thing), and deleting my Thunderbolt Ethernet setup in System Preferences.

My ethernet speeds (same network as an old Mac Mini) are 50x more (very seriously) than my iMac 5k.  I get about 70Mb/s on the old Mac Mini and only about 1.5-2Mb/s on the iMac.  I checked the network traffic, I checked the processing in the background ...  nothing.  That's changed recently (with nothing else changing) and I think it was due to an update.  Frustrating though.\n", "Q: OS volume shows as type 'FFFFFFFF-FFFF-FFFF-FFFF-FFFFFFFF' after attempting to delete some Linux partitions—cannot log in I was unable to just delete the partitions left by an old Linux Mint installation by pressing the '-' button in disk utility.

And sometimes, my iPhone Personal Hotspot gets turned on automatically.  What is happening here?  This does not happen often, and when it does, it is usually when the WiFi signal is unstable.  3G is always there as a back up, so I don't know why my phone is trying to cover for this unstable signal.  \n\nA: It seems you're seeing the \"Instant Hotspot\" feature available on the devices running iOS 8 or later. It's a part of Apple's continuity features that lets you share the data connection from your iPhone or iPad (cellular) to your WiFi only Apple device. It uses your Apple ID for authentification, BT LE for connection and Wi-Fi for data transfer. Thus, it's different from a personal hotspot, which required a password. You can read about it here: https://support.apple.com/en-in/HT204681#hotspot\nAs of iOS 9.3, you cannot disable the Instant Hostspot.

I want a MacBook Pro do I need to get one with the graphics card or will I be ok without one? I can spend the $2500 if I have to but would like the cheaper one if possible. \n\nA: You can check the hardware requirements of the games you want to play in the App Store. This will give you a good idea on what exactly you'll need. \n\nA: If you look at the latest machines, you've got the built-in Intel Iris 6100 graphics with optional AMD Radeon R9 M370x.\nIf you're concerned about gaming, the AMD chip is going to get you roughly 20% faster performance and slightly better quality lighting than the Iris can do.\nOne nice but probably less important thing to note is that the AMD chip has its own dedicated video memory (2 or 3GB I think) whereas the Iris chip steals from your main RAM pool as needed. GDDR5 is faster than DDR3/DDR4 (or whatever is in the MBP), but that probably accounts for a few percentage of the speed increase.\nThe AMD chip is only switched on when needed, so under typical desktop mode you're going to be running the Iris. However, the AMD chip does allow for a 4K display to be connected via the Thunderbolt port at up to 5120x2880 which the Iris alone doesn't support and thus would enable the AMD chip for desktop.\nSo it comes down to getting the separate GPU if you want slightly better gaming or ability to use a huge external display.\n", "Q: High CPU utilization due to Firefox in El Capitan 10.11.4 I am using Firefox with 10-14 open tabs (AWS console, JIRA, GitLab, etc).My Mac hangs due to high CPU utilization by Firefox as per Activity Monitor.

My Mac hangs due to high CPU utilization by Firefox as per Activity Monitor. Can someone help me with this.\nA.

That way you can isolate what come from the system, what come from the browser and what errors come when you have everything running.\nThere are 3 things that are apparent in the logs at first glance.

On 10.8 to probably 10.12-ish (have not checked precisely) there is a binary /System/Library/CoreServices/Menu Extras/Battery.menu/Contents/Resources/lowBatteryWarning that is invoked by SystemUIServer which is the one that actually sends the notification to NC. The binary checks whether it's called by SystemUIServer before executing.\nWhile it's easy to replicate the notification behavior with external applications which monitor battery percentage, I suppose if you really wanted  to do this \"natively\" you could disable SIP and inject code into SystemUIServer to manually trigger the alert. The trigger for alert is the result IOPSGetBatteryWarningLevel(), not based on the percentage directly, and I wouldn't recommend patching that function directly since who knows what else in SystemUIServer might depend on it. Instead you should modify the calling method in BatteryExtra to add a tail-call that checks the current percentage and if so, invokes the binary.\n", "Q: Change iTerm2 profile depending on current directory Using my .bash_profile, I used to change my iTerm2 profile per machine with the following command:\necho -e \"\\033]50;SetProfile=ssh\\a\"\n\nNow, I want to change it depending on my current working directory.\nIdeally must work something like this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Once I enter /mnt/production or any subfolder inside, iTerm should change to production profile.\n\n*Once I leave that directory, should change to bash profile.\n\n\nIs there any way of doing that?\n\nA: Finally I found a solution using bash-preexec.\nThat utility have the following function:\nprecmd Executed just before each prompt.

Any clues? I found the source and destination ports and some other data that doesn't look like http messages. I would like to see how stuff works for educational purposes.\n\nA: You can inspect network packets with WireShark.\nThis software capture all packets through a network interface, although you can select only the protocol you want by applying a filter in its settings.\n\nA: In addition, you can use the built in command line tool tcpdump. You will need root privileges to use it (so execute it with the sudo command) - e.g. to see all IP traffic going through your interface, without listening to all other hosts' traffic, you can run: \nsudo tcpdump -i en0 -p -vv -A ip \n\nIf you want to limit the output of tcpdump to only show traffic to/from a particular host or IP range, you can do: \nsudo tcpdump -i en0 -p -vv -A ip and host 192.0.2.123\n\nor \nsudo tcpdump -i en0 -p -vv -A ip and net 192.0.2.0/24\n\nRead more about tcpdump by running man tcpdump in your Terminal. \n", "Q: Search for link in Mail and click on it without using the mouse Sometimes I receive an e-mail, which contains a link that I have to follow.

Some applications will signal to the OS that they can open special link type, such as ssh:// or github-mac://.  They get automatically opened for such links by the web browser (or when using open in a terminal).  If I have multiple such applications, how can I set which one should be the default?\nFor example, both GitHub Desktop and SourceTree can handle github-mac://. When I installed GitHub Desktop, it became the default handler for these links.

I have no Mac that can run Catalina, so I'm reliant on others to keep this answer up to date.\nFrom comments, SwiftDefaultApps reported as working in Catalina 10.15.5\n\nYou can do that with a freeware app called RCDefaultApp. It's ancient, but still works on El Capitan.\nUpdate April 2019 - still works on Mojave too.\nYou can define the default app for any URL scheme.\nI don't have one for github, but this shows how you can set, for example, ftps specifically to any installed app that supports the protocol.\n\n\nA: Since it hasn't been mentioned yet, there is also a great, modern app called Choosy that can be used to change default browser-opening behavior for different links, different times of day, etc.\n\nA: And there is URL Scheme Defaults, though not as powerful as SwiftDefaultApps. The app only handles URL schemes and no file extensions, etc.. But it is a standalone app and does not require you to install a pref pane.\n\n\nA: Install duti.

Keeping the automatically installed X.Org and remove XQuartz?\nedit: changed the question and added a second one.\n\nA: In general you are confusing several things.\nXQuartz is a set of libraries to allow X11 applications to be compiled and run on OSX. It is based on the X11 sources from X.org the changes were originally done by Apple.\nQuartz is the set of technologies that are in the OSX Core Graphics that deal with 2d from wikipedia \n\nQuartz is often synonymous with Core Graphics\n\nThus Quartz is so called as it provides the X11 libraries that work by calling Quartz provided APIs\nIn the macports variants.conf what you are saying is don't use X11 (i.e. XQuartz) but use Apple's graphics directly and not via X11 so not calling any X.org code\n\nA: If you want to keep independant your future upgrades of XQuartz and MacPorts, then you will have to keep both installations.\nXQuartz is installing libraries, binaries in /opt/X11.\nMacPorts is installing sources, configurations, dependancies, libraries, binaries in /usr/local or where you prefarably decided to configure it. In my case to avoid any risk of confusion with other package managers, I configured MacPorts to work on the base of the\nrootdir /opt/local.\nIf you remove a needed library within the install path of MacPorts it will have to rebuild it. On the other hand, it will never upgrade anything when you modified the XQuartz version because it is outside of its managed source and install tree.\nThis practical way of managment stand without problem since Snow Leopard up to Sierra.\n", "Q: Change shortcut to change input source (keyboard language) I'm trying to change the keyboard combination to change the input source from Option-Command-Space / Command-Space to any other combination.

Or is it encrypted? I had a problem with the digitizer connector in my iPhone 5S so I can't use the screen anymore, I couldn't even unlock it to back it up.\nSo I send it to a logic board specialist to replace damaged connectors with new ones.\nMy iPhone is locked with a 4 digit password.\nIs the data inside its storage accessible somehow without having the 4-digit password? like putting the storage in another logic board or connecting the storage to a computer using special devices and extract data.\nOr is it encrypted and can be read only using the 4-digit password?\nMy iPhone is an 5S with iOS 8.3\n\nA: Data on an iPhone is always encrypted.  To answer your question it helps to  understand a few things about encryption on the iPhone.  Your data is not actually encrypted with your passcode.  Each file is encrypted with a key.  Those keys are encrypted by other keys in several layers.  These layers enable granular control over which applications and processes on the phone can access the data.  Each of these keys are \"strong\" (meaning it is really long) and cannot be easily guessed.  At the final level the keys are encrypted using a combination of two pieces of information.  The first piece of information is tied to the hardware and is \"strong\" so it is not practical to try and guess it.  The second is your passcode.  A four digit passcode is considered weak and can be cracked in a matter of minutes if the person trying to break in can make a large number of attempts.  If someone has access to all your hardware then it would be possible to read your data.  If you have set your phone to wipe after 10 bad password attempts then it is harder.  However, it turns out that most people pick a passcode that can easily be guessed in less then 10 attempts.  You might be surprised how many phones can be unlocked with \"1234\".  If the person trying to get your data doesn't have your phone (e.g. they insert your storage into a different device) then it is virtually impossible to read your data.\nIn summary, if you have selected a passcode that is not easy to guess and set your phone to wipe after 10 bad password attempts then your data is safe, otherwise you might have cause to worry.\n", "Q: Screenshot Save Destination I am constantly using the command-shift-4 command to take a screenshot, since it is so easy, but it will always save to my Desktop, and I like having my Desktop clean.

I decided to open the iMac (remove the screen) and replace the internal spinning drive with a Samsung 850 SSD to improve performance.\nThe job will take about 90 to 120 mins total.  Most of the time will be spent separating the glue between the aluminum housing and the glass.  Once you separate it, you can easily remove the glass and access to the drives are extremely easy.\niFixit.com has excellent instructions on how to do this.  A couple of items you will need are:\n\n*\n\n*Pentalobe Screwdriver\n\n*Replacement Adhesive Tape\n\n*3.5\" drive bracket\n\niFixit will recommend that you use one of those special tools to cut the adhesive.  I used a super sharp Exacto knife and wrapped some blue tape around the blade so that only a 1/2\" of the knife was exposed.  I cut all around all three sides then used a plastic putty knife to pry it loose.\nIt is much, much easier than it sounds.  Read the iFixit guide 3 times carefully before starting.  It will make it go much easier.\nOne thing to note is that in my particular machine, what I thought was an Fusion Drive was actually two drives put together (a 128GB SST and a 1TB HDD) using CoreStorage (a DIY Fusion Drive).   I added the Samsung SSD to the one already there, combined them into one volume and I have a 1.12 TB HDD\nIf you can boot your Mac, issue the command diskutil list and if you get anything that appears to be 3 drives in total, you have a DIY Fusion drive.\nIf you can't boot, you will need to take a look at the SSD connector on the logic board (it's by the fan).\n\nA: I have a 2010 iMac and the drive was failing. I purchased a 1 TB external SSD and connected it to my iMac. I set that drive as my startup disk and restarted. My computer worked fine using this setup and no real effort was required.  It was connected to my iMac using the USB cable included. I don't get all the speed improvements you normally get with an SSD due to the USB-A connection offered by my iMac.

Since you are already \"using various online tools for translation and proofreading,\" I assume you are also copy and pasting between the tools. The easiest solution would to just paste the text into a different text editor as an intermediate step. This should reveal tabs vs. spaces, and different types of line endings.\nThis will not show the difference between non-breaking spaces and spaces, though. You could view the source and search for \"&nbsp;\" but that will be hit or miss, because people aren't consistent.\n\nA: Not sure if this is a solution, but if you are using FireFox, you can highlight the text, right-click, and use 'View Selection Source', assuming its text present in the HTML of the page. For example, your previous comment looks like this:\n<span class=\"comment-copy\">There is actually a difference in text editors between breaking and non breaking spaces (cf my pages link), but the reason I ask is that I would gain productivity if I didn't have to copy and paste hundred of strings every day from browser &gt; text editor then text editor &gt; pro correction software...</span>\n\nAnother thing that might be useful is to do the same but select 'Inspect Element'. There might be other things you can do with these tools in FireFox, or you might be able to come up with some sort of script that does this. \n\nA: After asking this question here, and seeing that this feature wasn't available in browsers that currently exist (natively or through add-ons), I decided to take the matter in my own hands and develop this myself.\nI created a small bookmarklet called Interpunkd that displays the invisible characters on a webpage and allows writers to proofread their copy from within their browsers.\nThis is Interpunkd.\nI was asking this question here because in my line of work many of my colleagues use online writing tools, and use different computers or browsers. \nAfter being stumped trying to find a way to do this, and after asking this question here fruitlessly, I remembered of some bookmarklet tools I frequently use (such as Fount, FFFFOUND! or Katamari Hack), and decided to develop this feature as a bookmarklet to allow anyone to display invisible characters on almost any webpage, and on any browser/OS.\nNote: please let me know if this answer in any way violates the guidelines of this community. I completely understand that it might appear to be self-promotion for something I developed, but please consider that (1) this tool is free for anyone to use, that (2) it didn't exist at the time I asked the question, nor did I know I was going to have to develop it myself back then, and that (3) this is the closest answer possible to this question, to my knowledge. \nIf you disagree, please let me know in the comments rather than down-voting, thanks.\n", "Q: Broken iPad (Screen) I found donated iPad (Possibly a first generation, 16gb) at a donation center I work at.

I guess my iPad was connected or something, but I found that the operating system's mail application now had the accounts that I had on my iPad! This is a huge no, no. I wasn't even asked for it to do this, not to mention I don't know how it could have done this since only iTunes, AFAIK, syncs with iOS devices. How do I disable this?\n\nA: More than likely, your Mac synced with your iPad and got data from iCloud. Go to Settings -> iCloud, and see if Mail is turned on. If so, and you do not want these to sync together, turn it off. Then, you can simply delete the accounts from the Mail app on your Mac. \nIn regard to your question about other \"surprises,\" while you're in Settings on your iPad, take a look around any other areas, such as Notes, Calendar, etc. that you may not want to sync to your Mac.\n", "Q: Visual Voicemail won't let me play back or adjust greeting I have a new iPhone SE running iOS 9.3.1, restored from a backup of my old iPhone 4S. Also I have changed carriers upon getting the new phone to Cricket from AT&T.\nWhen I set up the new iPhone, it installed carrier updates from iTunes and the Phone app let me set up my visual voicemail with the passcode and custom greeting, and I tested it out and the visual voicemail worked.\nNow, however, when I go to the Phone app and tap Greeting in the Voicemail tab, it brings up the page that would let me play and record a new greeting, but the only working button is Cancel. All the buttons appear as if they work but they don't respond.\nI've tried resetting the Voicemail passcode in the Phone settings, I've tried resetting network settings, I've tried rebooting. The problem remains. What is the solution?\nOne other note, though I can't tell if this is coincidence or the cause, perhaps you can enlighten me: I wanted to completely wipe my old iPhone so it would be ready for another to set up as their own, but that phone's WiFi doesn't work right, and so in order to get internet access enough to unlock iCloud and do the erase, I took my Cricket sim out, and (with a nano to micro sim adapter that came with my Cricket SIM originally) put it in to the 4S so it could get some 4G internet and authorize the erase. After I put the Cricket sim back in the iPhone SE, I noticed it occasionally lose the LTE connection that I don't recall it doing previously in the last week that I had the new phone. Could be a fluke though. And I don't know if the Voicemail greeting problem was around before because I wasn't checking it and wasn't getting lots of voicemails exactly. Also I tried giving myself a test voicemail and it wouldn't let me play it back, though after some resetting or I don't know what the playback works again. Don't know if that's useful or irrelevant or rambling.\nEdit: The bit about my iPhone losing LTE, I think I've narrowed down the problem. I think it's just because Cricket isn't yet using VoLTE and I wasn't testing many phone calls. As it stands though I cannot change the greeting except through calling voicemail directly. This is not a massive problem though I would like to know what could be going on or if I should contact Apple Support since this is a new phone.\nAlso I kept playing around with it and at one time I did get the Greeting controls to work. And then it stopped working again. Don't know what's up or why that would be caused. Is it possible what I did with the SIM would cause this?\n\nA: My Iphone 6 uses Verizon. I successfully changed VM greeting a couple of days ago then tried to change again the same day but none of the VM greeting buttons would work except cancel.  Called Verizon and they had me reset all settings. Still didn't work. The told me to re-set network settings and still didn't work.  The referred me to apple and I did a did a back up and restored using by back up.  Still didn't work. They wanted me to try to restore as new without the backup which I was reluctant to do. \nJust deleted VMs and Delted VMs, and (for now) I'm able to record and change my VM greetings.  Thanks Kal-al\n\nA: Mine seemed to not let me play or record a new message (or switch it back to default) and all I had to do was wait ~2 minutes with the voicemail screen pulled up.

It seems that the new battery is glued into the computer. Does this mean that it can't be replaced, or has Apple somehow figured out a way to remove the glue?\n\nA: The battery in the new MacBook is replaceable but Apple recommends that you bring it to them for servicing and replacement, if necessary.  Here's what Apple says about the battery:\n\nMacBook, MacBook Air, and MacBook Pro computers with built-in batteries should only have their batteries replaced by an Apple Authorized Service Provider or Apple Retail Store.

I have a Perl script that does some text transformation on a given file. \nNow I would like to call this script from an AppleScript which in turn I could execute from the script menu in order to run the Perl script on a set of files with a choose folder prompt.  My Perl script starts like this: \nopen my $in, '<', 'myfile.txt' or die \"No input: $!\";\nopen my $out, '>', 'myfile-modified.txt';\n\nAnd then it does a bunch of search-and-replace and what not.  \nI would like to somehow call this script from an AppleScript and process multiple files. The AppleScript should look more or less like this: \nset myFolder to choose folder with prompt \"Choose a folder:\"\ntell application \"Finder\"\n    try\n        set myFiles to (every file in entire contents of myFolder whose name ends with \".txt\") as alias list\n    on error\n        try\n            set myFiles to ((every file in entire contents of myFolder whose name ends with \".txt\") as alias) as list\n        on error\n            set myFiles to {}\n            display dialog \"No files in folder.\"\n        end try\n    end try\nend tell\n\nHow can I run the Perl script from AppleScript while passing myFiles as a variable to it (the perl script) and looping through them?  I assume I have to do a do shell script command but I don't know how to pass the variables on.\nI also don't know whether it'd be better to pass the files as a file list to perl or to somehow put that into a repeat loop within AppleScript? \n\nA: \nThe maximum length of a command line is 2**18 bytes:\n$ getconf ARG_MAX\n262144\n\nSo that for example this results in an error:\nread \"/usr/share/dict/web2\" for 270000\ndo shell script \"printf %s \" & quoted form of result\n\nIf the input is short enough, you can pass it to perl as part of the command line:\nread \"/usr/share/dict/web2\" for 260000\ndo shell script \"printf %s\\\\\\\\n \" & quoted form of result & \"|perl -pe'$_=uc'\"\n\nOtherwise you can use a temporary file:\nset input to read \"/usr/share/dict/web2\" for 270000\nset f to (system attribute \"TMPDIR\") & \"my.tempfile\"\nset fd to open for access f with write permission\nset eof fd to 0\nwrite input to fd as «class utf8»\nclose access fd\ndo shell script \"perl -pe'$_=uc' \" & f & \";rm \" & f\n\nThe default text encoding is still an encoding like MacRoman or MacJapanese, so that adding as «class utf8» to the write command preserves non-ASCII characters, even though it is not necessary in the example above.\nIn your case you could also do something like this:\nquoted form of POSIX path of (choose folder)\ndo shell script \"find \" & result & \" -name \\\\*.txt|perl -pe'$_=uc'\"\n\nquoted form of escapes text for shells, so that it replaces ' with '\\'' and surrounds text with single quotes.\n\nA: I finally figured it out:\nI can achieve what I want by using the $ARGV array which holds all arguments that are passed on to the perl script via the command line.  In an applescript I can simply put this line:\ndo shell script \"perl myscript.pl inputfile outputfile\"\n\nAssuming inputfile and ouputfile are the (paths to) the files I want to run the perl script on.  I then call inputfile with $ARGV[0] (the first argument passed on) and outputfile with $ARGV[1] (the second argument).\nopen my $fh_in, '<', $ARGV[0] or die \"No input: $!\";\nopen my $fh_out, '>', $ARGV[1] or die \"No output: $!\";\n\nHope this will be useful to someone. \n", "Q: Is there an iOS alternative to HTC's Zoe?

I have recently upgraded my 8GB MacBook Pro (mid 2010, model ID: MacBookPro6,2) from OS X 10.6.8 to 10.11.4.\nUnder Snow Leopard, after I closed the lid it would take something like 30 seconds to write memory contents to disk before the HDD would spin down and the sleep light begin to pulsate.\nUnder El Capitan, it takes five to six minutes between when I initiate sleep and when the machine actually powers down and the sleep light begins to pulsate.\n\n\n*\n\n*During this time there is very high CPU usage, as evidence by:\n\n\n*\n\n*The fans often spin up (to very high speed, if I have closed the lid and zipped the machine into the neoprene case I normally carry it in).\n\n*The period of high CPU usage is clearly visible in Activity Monitor upon waking:\n\n\n\nScreenshot after waking from full sleep; note CPU usage was very high, then moderately high while going to sleep; there is a momentary spike (presumably upon wake) and then drops to near idle again:\n\nSreenshot after putting machine back to sleep, then waking again after one minute (while machine was still busy); note CPU was near idle until sleep initiated, whereupon it was very, very high, then very high, then back to near idle upon wake: \n\n\n\n*\n\n*I note that /private/var/vm/sleepimage is exactly 4GiB, even though I have 8GiB of RAM.

No. Not with an optimal install, optimal hardware & configuration. \nIs your computer stock or have you installed non-oem parts? Age can also be a factor as the thermal grease can deteriorate over time especially when a cpu gets overheated. Also Apple had indicated that you need a minimum of 1GB free to even be able to run effectively. My experience is that having much more than 1GB allows the system to run best.\nWhat can you do to fix it? Take a free disk and install the OS on it. Boot from that disk and see if the problem disappears. If it is gone then it's a software issue. If it still exists, you have a hardware or resource issue. If it's software you can create a new user and log in under that account. If the problem is gone then it's the old user account. If it's not, do a clean install of the system. If the problem is gone then it was a problem with the system.\nWhat can you do to mitigate it? See the second response to fix it or replace the machine.\n\nA: Would just add - I had a similar problem with sleep on a MacPro 1.1 Tower. Turned out it was heat... which might explain why your fans are going up also. The Mac wont go to sleep above a certain temperature so will continue to run until this comes down which could be 60 seconds or 10 minutes.\nI installed SMC Fan Control, a free app which allows you to take control of your internal fans and (typically) set them 25% higher.

Here is the launchd file:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple Computer//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple$\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n   <dict>\n   <key>Label</key>\n   <string>com.stunnel.stunnelstartup.plist</string>\n   <key>ProgramArguments</key>\n   <array>\n          <string>/bin/sh</string>\n          <string>/usr/local/etc/stunnel/startup.sh</string>\n   </array>\n   <key>UserName</key>\n   <string>ROOT</string>\n   <key>RunAtLoad</key>\n   <true/>\n   <key>KeepAlive</key>\n   <false/>\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\nAnd here is the shell script:\n#!/bin/bash\n#stunnel startup\nsleep 30 #Delay added for the system to boot properly\nsudo stunnel\n\nWhat am I doing wrong???\nEDIT: I have done what all of the answers have suggested so far, with still no luck.

When a launchd-managed process exits, launchd defaults to automatically killing off any leftover subprocesses... like the background stunnel process. I haven't tested these, but there are two simple ways to avoid this.\nFirst, you can tell launchd not to kill leftover subprocesses by adding <key>AbandonProcessGroup</key><true/> to the .plist.\nSecond, you can tell stunnel to not background itself by adding foreground = yes to its config file. If you do the second option, you can probably also remove <key>KeepAlive</key><false/> from your .plist, and let launchd manage the stunnel daemon properly.\n[Update] If that and Mark's suggestions don't get it working, I'd recommend adding some debugging output in the script, and sending that and stunnel's output to a log file. Something like this:\n#!/bin/bash\n#stunnel startup\nexec >/tmp/stunnel.log 2>&1 # Send all output to a debug log\nsleep 30 #Delay added for the system to boot properly\necho \"$(date) - Starting stunnel\"\nsudo /path/to/stunnel\necho \"$(date) - stunnel exited with status $?\"\necho\n\nYou can do similar things by adding StandardOutPath and StandardErrorPath keys, but in this case it's easier to edit the script.\n\nA: There are several things which need checking here but this is not a direct answer as not all of them might be the issue here.\nFor a working example for macports see here\n\n\n*\n\n*Where is stunnel the path is not the same in launchd as it is in a terminal session \n\n*You can't have sudo in the script as run by root - however in this case you don't need the script just run the execrable directly\n\n*The username is root not ROOT \n\n*Where do you put the plist file?\n\n\nI would also suggest a daemon should not be run at startup but only when a connection comes in on a socket but that appears to be how stunned is written not an installation problem \nAlthough seeing this other answer I am surprised that the example plist files I have seen work (and my last comment is more relevant)\n", "Q: How to hack into a deceased person's Mac that is still running?

After waiting about 30 minutes without the progress bar moving, I quit the Boot Camp Assistant, thinking I would be able to fix the partition either by using the Boot Camp Assistant or the Disk Utility. However, the partition doesn't appear in either. Instead, my drive has just become 50 GB smaller. Looking for other solutions, people were generally able to find the partition by using Terminal application commands, however I haven't even been able to do that. (Notice in Disk Utility, it says Macintosh HD is 441.65GB, but \"Capacity\" is 500.28GB):\n\nI tried booting in Recovery mode and doing First Aid in the Disk Utility.

I always slide off the switch under the mouse after the mac shuts down as I have seen it to save battery life to some extent. \nSince a week the mouse does not switch ON consistently, it does not show the green light at all. \nWhen I took it to a nearby Apple service center, it turned ON surprisingly.\nBut, back home it stopped working again. It somehow worked after many attempts. Today it stopped working again.\nI have cleaned the terminals, and all looks fine. But I have some doubt on the slide switch.\nThe mouse has been used carefully and has never been dropped.\nHas anyone experienced this, any input? \n\nA: Thanks to all.\nI was able to solve this puzzle:)\nObservation/solution: \nWhen we shutdown the Mac, the mouse and the keyboard go to sleep mode(this is instructed by the mac to the mouse/keyboard controllers) to conserve battery. I usually switch them off at this moment. \nFor the mouse and the keyboard to work with the mac there is a bluetooth setup done by the mac. Likewise, the mouse and the keyboard will have some controller working in sync with the mac. As I had this habit of turning the devices off, right when their controllers were instructing them to sleep, some configuration in the magic mouse could have gone wrong making it stay in sleep mode even when you switch ON and go out of sync with the mac.\nSo, what I did this time when it turned ON somehow is shutdown the mac, leaving the devices to sleep as designed and turned ON the mac back again.\nThe mouse and keyboard powered back with green lights. Later, while the mac was running, I tried all combinations of turning the mouse ON and OFF through batteries and the button, but the mouse responded well.\nI now understand that to avoid this rare problem, which could happen at some point when you turn off the mouse while it goes to sleep through an instruction from mac which is shutting down, is to wait. Wait till the mouse sleeps completely, i.e, the green light goes off plus 2-5 seconds more for its controller to sleep and then turn the slide button off. Same with the keyboard.\n\nA: On my Macbook Pro, every time I switch on the Magic Mouse I need to click on it to connect to my Mac. Maybe that's what you need to do ?\n", "Q: Why does OS X have bash v3.2.57? OS X comes with bash version 3.2.57 instead of bash version 4.3.39, which GNU lists as the current stable release of bash.\nIs there any way to upgrade bash on Mac OS X?\n\nA: Note the original question asked why Apple shipped an old version of bash and then asked how to upgrade. This is an answer to the original. If the question is just the latter then it is a duplicate\nYou would have to ask Apple as to why. However I would note that bash is now licensed under GPLv3 and   3.2.57 is the last version released under GPL2.\nAs bash is in /bin you should not replace it directly as this can be updated or modified by Apple at any time and now with SIP it is also more difficult to change. Also scripts elsewhere might depend one this version\nYou can however add bash from GNU or from a package manager like Macports or Homebrew. You can then change the Terminal.app profile to start this shell rather than bash\nMacports is\nsudo port install bash\n\nHomebrew is\nbrew install bash\n\nAs of 14/6/16 - the stable version of bash is 4.3.42 and updates usually come rapidly through both port systems.\nOr you could change your shell to another that Apple supplies e.g.  zsh which is more powerful than bash (version up to date of release of El Capitan) or ksh which is upto date. (or tcsh which is a C shell but also reasonably up to date)\n", "Q: Buying used iPhone5c - need to know about iCloud I am supposed to buy the phone off someone.

The password does work for the email on the phone. \nWould I be able to use it for getting online, downloading apps and such? Any major things I would not be able to do with it? \nThanks in advance!!\n\nA: There are two possible scenarios:\n\n\n*\n\n*The device is up and running, and you can unlock it with the four digit code. If that's the case go to Settings -> iCloud and choose logout at the bottom of the page. Then you only need the password of the account.\n\n*The device was restored to factory settings. In this case activation lock would be active and you need to know the AppleID and the matching password. If you don't know these you need the original receipt and an appointment at your Apple Store to unlock it. The receipt needs to contain your name, otherwise you need help from the person whose name is on the receipt. \n", "Q: How can I install Fedora Linux on a MacBook Pro, Model A1150? I performed the following steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Formatted a USB Flash Drive as: FAT32\n\n*Copied the Fedora Live ISO image to: /efi/boot/boot.iso\n\n*Copied ISO 2 USB EFI Booter for Mac to: /efi/boot/boot.efi\nI then inserted the USB Flash Drive into the MacBook Pro, pressing the  option key directly after turning it on. However, after selecting the disk to boot from, it only booted to a grub prompt.\nWhat else do I need to boot this Fedora Live ISO image from a USB Flash Drive?\n\nA: I see in your question, per the second and third bullet points, you are attempting to boot the USB Flash Drive via UEFI.\nFrom 4.2 UEFI boot of USB sticks on How to create and use Live USB\n\nThere are two MacBook Pro's with Model Number A1150, both having the Model Identifier MacBookPro1,1 with one of the following Processors, Intel Core Duo (T2400, T2500, T2600) and Intel Core Duo (T2500, T2600) on the 15\" Glossy Display.\n\n\n*\n\n*All three processors listed use a 32-bit Instruction Set.\nTherefore, since UEFI booting is only supported with the 64-bit release of Fedora and the MacBook Pro model A1150 has a 32-bit processor, you will need to download and burn a 32-bit version of Fedora to optical media (CD/DVD) and attempt to boot from it, if that too is even possible.\n\nA: I have a (17-inch, early 2006) iMac which, like your Mac, is a 32 bit machine.  I downloaded the file Fedora-Live-Workstation-i686-23-10.iso from Fedora. This is the \"32-bit 1.3GB Live Image\" found at this web page. Next, I burned the file to a RW DVD. I inserted the DVD in my Mac and held down the option key at startup. A DVD icon label \"Windows\" appeared. After selecting this icon, the computer attempted to boot to a live version of Fedora. This failed.\nNext, I tried booting again and this time, when prompted, I selected \"Troubleshooting\". From the menu that next appeared, I selected \"Test this media & start Fedora Live\". This led to a successful boot of Fedora Live. \n\nNote: With Fedora, if I leave the computer unattended for a sufficient amount of time, the computer will go to sleep. To wake, I needed to tap the power button.\n\nI did not attempt to install Fedora, but this option was presented to me.\n\nNote: This version of Fedora requires a BIOS to boot the computer. My computer was shipped without the ability to BIOS boot an operating systems. I needed to install a firmware update to enable this type of boot. The web site for such updates is \"About EFI and SMC firmware updates for Intel-based Mac computers\". To install such updates, requires OS X to be installed on your Mac.\n\nIf you can not boot from this DVD, the solution may require applying a firmware update to your Mac.\n", "Q: Remote desktop display shifted up I use the Microsoft Remote Desktop Client (ver 8.0.31) to connect from my 2013 Retina Macbook Pro (OSX 10.11.4) to a Windows 10 desktop machine.

I use the VR200v as a router and modem.\nOur DSL was down for a few minutes last weekend. While I'm not 100% sure those two things are related, ever since then, the iPhone hasn't been able to properly connect to my Wifi. The phone claims that it's connected but I can't open any websites and also can't access my router's configuration interface (192.168.1.1).

Two laptops, TV, the Motorola, all work and have stable internet connections. \nWhat I've tried\nThe router allows 2.4 and 5GHz frequencies. I tried both, with and without WPA2 passwords. Same results.\nI wiped the iPhone and restored it from a backup, hoping to clear some sort of messed up configuration. It didn't make a difference. I tried connecting both the 2.4GHz and the 5GHz Wifi during the setup without restoring it first, same result.\nI tried a different Firmware for the router, still no connection. \nI tried manually setting the channel (tried several for 2.4 and 5GHz) and the channel width, which had been suggested by people with similar problems, that didn't help though. \nOther people suggested disabling WMM on the router (i.e. http://www.ceus-now.com/wifi-connection-problem-iphone-to-tp-link-router/)\nThe problem is, I haven't found a way to disable WMM on my router. It claims that WMM is obligatory for the 802.11n und 802.11ac modes, which suggests that 802.11g allows disabling it. However I can only choose between 'Only 802.11n', '802.11gn mixed' and '802.11bgn mixed'. \n_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ __\nSo I'm really out of ideas here. I feel like some setting hasn't been deleted 100% and creates some sort of issue between the phone and the router.  Has anyone experienced something like this before? I'm open for suggestions! \n\nA: Solution\nThe last resort was resetting the Router and setting it up from scratch. It worked, WiFi is working on the iPhone again!\n\nA: Resetting the iPhone was a good step, but restoring from backup may have restored faulty settings.\nAnother step to troubleshoot network connections is this more limited reset:\nSettings > General > Reset > Reset Network Settings.\nApple's guide to troubleshooting this issue is here: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204051 \n\nA: I had the same problem with the iPhone 5s. \nCheck that you have not recently downloaded any new app which is not allowed in your country or banned like VPN secure or secure vpn. \nDelete it and reinstall after getting WiFi signal.\n\nA: What I did...\nI took the connection information from a wifi/internet functional smart phone...\nIP address\nSubnet Mask\nRouter\nDNS\nand manually entered it as a Static connection on the trouble causing iPhone...\nI disconnected the original smartphone so not to cause any conflicts and finalized on my iPhone...\nIt seems to work now... we'll see how long it lasts!\n\nA: Logged into router 192.168.1.1 \nChanged router to wpa/wpk to both. \nIphone now works good.\n", "Q: \"Backup Disk Not Available\", Time Machine can't find Time Capsule any more I have a 2 TB Time Capsule and it was used by Time Machine for many months.\nSome days ago the Time Capsule was disconnected from its power supply and today is now connected again. \nTime Machine reports the error \"Backup Disk Not Available\".\nThe Time Capsule lights are green, AirPort Utility is showing this device with green lights also. \nTime Machine knows how much space is available on that device. However, it is not able to use this device for listing older backups or to create a new one.\nI can't see this device in Finder, although I couldn't see it there when everything works fine. Airport Utility reports an IP Address for this device and I can ping it. \nWhat to do now? Is it possible at least to mount it to access the files on it? \n\n\n\n\n\n\nA: I had a similar effect a few days ago. \nI was able to select the disk (see your last printscreen) again and from then on it worked flawlessly... Can you select your disk again?\n\nA: I also had a similar problem backing up my data to external drive. But I figured it out by opening Disk Utility app on Mac and check what's wrong with my storage. And I saw that backup disk hasn't mounted. I tried to mount it and it was successful. But before mounting I needed to enter my password because it was encrypted.\n", "Q: Does charging my early 2015 MacBook Pro all the time damage the battery? I am using my early 2015 MacBook Pro as a desktop by connecting it to an external display, thus, it needs to be plugged in to a charger all the time.\nDoes charging my early 2015 MacBook Pro all the time damage the battery?\nIs it a bad practice?\n\nA: Apple recommends not leaving it plugged in all the time. This can damage the battery over time, as lithium-ion batteries need to be frequently discharged.\nIf you are going to use an external monitor, why not buy a desktop computer? MacBooks are made to be portable and have their batteries used.\n\nA: Keeping your Mac plugged in 24/7 is dangerous and will shorten the life of your battery exponentially. From imploding to starting a fire, you should only plug it in when needed. A while back I lost everything when I left my Mac (which was bought recently) plugged in for the week I went to Italy. The battery imploded and I was unable to retrieve anything. For safety and security, do not keep your Mac charging all of the time.\n\nA: No, not at all. I leave my MacBook Pro connected to the charger for days on end sometimes and the battery still works fine. Once the battery gets to 100%, if it is still connected to the charger the MacBook stops charging the battery automatically and allows the battery to go down to 97%, then allows the battery to charge back to 100%, and repeats that cycle until you disconnect the MacBook from the charger. If you've ever charged your MacBook overnight only to find it at 98% or 99%, this is why.\n", "Q: Unread Messages Badge Wrong in Dock I have a Macbook Pro 13\" running El Capitan, purchased in February 2016. For the iMessage app, which I have saved in the Dock, the unread messages badge says there is one unread message and there's not. If I click and hold on the iMessage icon, it tells me which message is unread. And I have viewed all of the messages from that person. I tried quitting and reopening the app - that didn't fix it. I restarted my computer, and that does fix it, but the same issue arises again within a few days.\nHow can I fix this so the badge count is accurate?\nI'm not great at using the Terminal. If you have a suggestion using the Terminal, please be very specific so I can replicate your suggestion easily.\nEDIT: I just discovered that the badge count is wrong on the Messages app on my Mac if I have a text message (not an iMessage) unread on my iPhone.\n\nA: That has happened to me. Try opening the app and clicking on the person who sent the last message (or simply click on all of your contacts). That should prove you have read all the messages and take away the badge. Hope this helps.\n\nA: Click the iMessage icon and hold it down, on the menu at the very top it will tell you where the \"unread\" message is. Click that and it will open it and clear the notification. \n\nA: *\n\n*First close the Messages app.\n\n*Open the Activity Monitor and force quit the Dock process.\n\n", "Q: Can I copy the mac OS directly from my macbook pro to a card in the SD slot? I bought a refurb macbook pro a few years back, to use for video editing. It came with Snow Leopard installed. I never upgraded beyond 10.6.8 as I still edit in FCP 7 and didn't want compatibility issues. Now I've reached the point where I need to upgrade my OS for pretty much everything other than video editing.\nSo I thought a good workaround might be to plug a microSD adapter into the SD slot, with a 128GB microSD card in it, and to install the OS 10.6.8 software on that. That way I could boot up from the SD drive when I need to do video editing, but the rest of the time I can just run the computer with the latest mac OS installed. \nSo here's my conundrum. When I bought the macbook pro as a refurb, it didn't come with software install disks. Is there a way to copy the 10.6.8 OS directly from my laptop to the microSD card? Or do I have to shell out the additional $ to buy another copy of 10.6.8 from the app store?\n\nA: You can use Disk Utility to make bootable copies of the OS. It's always preferable to use an OS that's not booted (i.e. you're not copying yourself), but in practice, OS X generally behaves well. Worst thing - you waste time with a non-bootable copy.\nYou could also look into something like SuperDuper or CarbonCopy Cloner. They will serve you for more than the initial need of making a backup copy of the OS.\nWorst case, you end up with a broken system and have to pick up a secondhand disk from craig's list or similar. Apple also sells replacement media, but used media is usually less expensive.\n", "Q: Updating Enterprise iOS apps remotely without Device Enrollment Program I have an Apple enterprise developer account with internal apps used on iPads that are only used by employees. Currently a manager sits and manually install each app on every website from an internal website. Searching for this brings up topics relating to the apple configurator and MerakiMDM, however it is unclear what these do and if they are the right solution.\nIt is also unclear to me if you actually need the Device Enrollment Program in order to set up a server and use MDM.\nIs there a way to update and perhaps install enterprise apps on remote devices without the need for the Device Enrollment Program?\n\nA: Since no one could answered this I tested it out and found a solution using OSX Server and no need for DEP.\nI turned on my macbook pro and purchased OSX server in the app store. Once installed you should be able to go to your local ip or whatever the host name is that your server assigns you, something like markuss-macbook-pro.local. Depending on your settings and network setup you may need to add this in DHCP or DNS, personally I have an Airport Express and the .local domain worked for other Apple devices out of the box.\nI was unable to find this online but OSX server comes with Tutorials under Help->Tutorials which shows you how to add devices and push remotely. See the image to see what it looks like\n\nBasically you need to enable the profile manager in the top right corner of the profile manager page and configure Device Management. Once this is done you can go to your url, something like myserver.local/mydevices/ on your iPad or iPhone (make sure you use Safari). If you don't have a valid ssl you will need to accept the insecure connection. \nAfter this was done I was able to manage my device, push apps, change settings and wipe it as long as it was connected to my local network. It seems that you will need a valid domain and SSL certificate that points to your OSX server in order to have this done from any connection but I have not tested this final part.\n\nA: It would be better to use an MDM software with inbuilt app distribution capabilities, like Hexnode MDM. Supervised iOS devices can provide you silent app install features, and you can Achieve supervision with Device Enrollment Program (DEP) or Apple Configurator. So if you use Apple Configurator, you will not be requiring DEP. If you use DEP, then you can skip the initial setup steps, but you need to hard reset the device before using DEP. Since you need to just install the apps, hard resetting does not seem to be good. You do not need DEP for setting up and using MDM, but it is better to have if you need to turn on supervision. Apple configurator can also enable supervision, as said before, but you need to connect your device to a computer running Mac OSX. See this article if you want to know more options.\nThere are standalone MAM (Mobile Application Management) services available, which helps you install apps remotely without providing MDM features. With  Hexnode MDM, you can have a complete Mobile Application Management experience - app catalog, app black/white listing, corporate wipe, in addition to device management functionalities. \n", "Q: How can I get my apps back after deleting all data? I recently had a problem with my MacBook Air. I went to Apple and they said they would fix it but all my data will get deleted. I said okay but when I got my MacBook back, I didn't know my apps would get deleted. Some of they apps were iMovie, Pages and Numbers. They were already installed when I first got the MacBook.\n\nA: Well, when they say \"all your data will get deleted\" that means apps too.\nYou can go to the Mac App Store, click on the Purchases tab, and re-install your apps.\n\nA: unfortunately, your apps are gone, or their saved date is.  You can go to the app store's purchased section, and re-download those apps. Its advised to always make periodic backups of your computers Harddrive, so if something goes wrong, you wont lose much. \nIf you are running a new version of OS X, say El Capitan, you may have ICloud Drive, pages will automatically upload to your iCloud drive, you could check that, I have never used iMovie, but their is a possibility that it may also do as pages does.  \n", "Q: How do I access \"hidden\" .help files Some years ago I created a Project (using Xcode 3 under OS X 10.6) and created a Help File, naming this MyApp.help in accordance with the tutorial.\nUnder more recent OS Apple (in its infinite wisdom) decided to make all .help files packages and not display contents. You could still see the contents in Finder with Show Package Contents.\nIn El Capitan the contents of .help files seems to be hidden, but seemingly not in the fashion that was previously used to hide files such as ~/Library.\n(It is still possible to display Package Contents in the finished .app to see these, so the intent does not seem to be to hide these from the end user.)\nHow do you get access to these files to modify contents and/or add new files? They are still there, and can be seen in the Terminal. cd PathToMyApp/MyApp.help/Contents/Resources\nEdit \nI was exploring the suggestions, without much success. After some trials I rebooted and could no longer see the files in Terminal.\nI have a backup to an external HDD (using rsync) and could see all the files when mounted on Linux. (I can also load and edit in BBEdit through a Project).\nI just tried again and they were all back in Terminal.\n\nA: I think I have solved my problem.\nIn Terminal I used chflags nohidden on the .help file and all the files now appear in Finder\n", "Q: In OS X Mail, what's the difference in checking new e-mail between \"Automatically\" and \"Every X minutes\"? While \"Manually\" option is absolutely clear to me, how differently will Mail behave when I will switch between \"Automatically\" and \"Every x minutes\"?\nI'm running 10.11.4.\n\n\nA: Unfortunately Apple Support is a little vague on \"Check for new messages\" in Mail (El Capitan): General preferences.\n\nWhen Mail gets new messages from the mail server. By default, the option is set to Automatically (Mail varies how often it gets messages, based on whether your Mac is plugged into an electrical outlet).\nAn IMAP account may get messages more frequently if the mail server supports the IDLE command; make sure the option to use it is selected in the account’s Advanced pane in Mail preferences.\nIf you set the option to Manually, click the Get Mail button  in the Mail toolbar to check for messages. (Whenever you click an IMAP or Exchange mailbox, it syncs with the server, and shows new messages.)\n\nIt's not at all specific about \"(Mail varies how often it gets messages, based on whether your Mac is plugged into an electrical outlet)\" and how often it is between the two states.\nAt least with an IMAP account the \"Use IDLE command if the server supports it\" from Mail (El Capitan): Advanced accounts preferences says:\n\nThe mail server pushes messages to your Inbox. When this option is not selected, Mail checks for new messages based on the setting in the General pane in Mail preferences.\nThis option is available only for IMAP accounts.\n\nSo the difference is when set to Automatically it will vary on different factors while when setting it to \"Every x minutes\" you know it's going to check however often \"x\" is.\n", "Q: To get Graphical Info reader in El Capitan? Graphical info reader is the reader which colorises links in the info pages. I know there are good options in OS X but I cannot find them. \nI do home search info and I get\nhomebrew/science/clinfo    media-info                 shared-mime-info         \nipinfo                     mp3info                    texinfo                  \njpeginfo                   pinfo                    \nhomebrew/emacs/pkg-info                  Caskroom/cask/mac-informer             \nhomebrew/games/inform6                   Caskroom/cask/mediainfo                \nCaskroom/cask/inform                     Caskroom/cask/pdfinfo\n\nbut nothing seems to be a info -pages reader. \n\nHow can you get a graphical reader of info -pages in El Capitan?\n\nA: The obvious one is emacs itself as info is its documentation format\nThe Apple supplied emacs does do this in the terminal as do more up to date ones\nThere are graphical versions Emacs.app for pure emacs and Aquamacs trying to be more like a standard OSX app. \nIf you need this from the command line other make .info files opened by the emacs app and use the command open or use emacsclient\n\nA: While it isn't strictly graphical, I find pinfo to be much more usable than most alternatives for reading info pages, and it can also read man pages. pinfo can be installed with brew install pinfo. Its key bindings, appearance, and behavior can be configured in a rudimentary fashion by editing /usr/local/etc/pinforc.\nIf you want to use pinfo in a graphical environment, I'd suggest creating a script that runs it inside your favorite terminal.\n\nThe standard GNU info reader (which is also terminal-based) is installed as part of the texinfo package in Homebrew, but according to the info docs,\n\nEmacs Info and stand-alone Info have nearly identical user interfaces, although customization and other details are different\n\nFor me, that makes the standard info reader a no-go as well. (I'm also a Dvorak/Vim user)\n\nAnother option is to use the /usr/local/Cellar/texinfo/*/bin/texi2any program (from the texinfo package) with the --html option to convert info pages to HTML, and then view them in a web browser. This requires a lot of up-front work before reading them, but could be worth it if you really prefer a graphical reader.\n", "Q: OS X Finder: Why does it take less time to copy files in succession than to do so all at once? Example: \n\n\n*\n\n*Select 10x2GB files, then drag and drop to another location. \n\n*Drag and drop each 2GB file to the location individually, in succession (10 times). \n\n\nI’ve tested this across multiple OS X versions and Apple computers, and the latter example always executes faster.\n\n\n*\n\n*Why’s the drag and drop sequential fashion faster? \n\n*That said, why doesn’t Finder just execute batch operations in the same manner? I must be missing something(s)…\n\n\nNote: This is a question that teeters on the edge of not being within the bounds of this site, yet nonetheless, one worth asking :)\n\nThe results are the same regardless of the order (batch/manual) in which it's performed.\n\nA: I think in your example you are copying all files to the same disk. If the finder is trying to write to multiple places (or reading from multiple places) on the same hard drive, it will be slowed down by drive access times. It is easier (faster) to read (or write) one whole file at a time rather than ten files at the same time.\nYou can observe similar behavior if you are compressing video to a smaller codec. If you choose to export to the same disk that you are reading your source file from, your export will go much slower than exporting to another drive.\nYou could re-do your test using 3 separate disks (provided those disks were not being accessed across the same bus (USB3/Thunderbolt, etc.). That might be interesting to test. \n", "Q: iPhone locked for ransom: how to recover if it's offline?

The problem may arise because of where Xcode is hosted?\nTry disabling your proxies.\n", "Q: Location of Speakers on MacBook Pro Retina, 13-inch This sounds obvious, but I've looked all over the internet and haven't been able to find a simple answer telling me where the sound comes out of on a 13-inch Retina MacBook Pro (late 2012). All I can see on the laptop itself are a bunch of vents at the connection between the screen and the keyboard, some longer vents on the left and right sides of the laptop's bottom, and the gaps between the keys themselves. Anyone have a clue?\n\nA: The speakers on the MacBook Pro 2012 are on the left and right sides between the aluminium case and the battery.  The photos below are of the Macbook Pro bottom case assembly.  The speakers are highlighted in red.\nLeft Speaker:\n\nRight Speaker:\n\nThe best place I have found on the web for information like this has been ifixit.com:  MacBook Pro 13\" Retina Display Late 2012 Repair\n\nA: It seems the gaps around the keys of the keyboard are meant to act as the speaker \"grilles\", however not the only avenue for sound to exit.\nSource: I use a silicone keyboard protector which covers all the keys with a single unbroken thin membrane. If I quickly remove it while listening to music, I notice the sound sharpen and become a little louder.\nAdded photo of my keyboard (belatedly, sorry) per the request below. It is embarrassingly filthy, which helps make it more visible in the photo :)  The silicone mat extends all the way to the beveled edges of the depression surrounding the keys, covering every opening in the top of the enclosure except for the vents inside the hinge area.\nThe two sets of three slots at the left and right edges of the bottom of the case (mentioned by the OP) do also seem to function as speaker grilles. I still get an acceptable amount of sound from my laptop even with the keyboard cover on, so my assumption is that they are intended to be the primary outlets, however given the noticeable sound change I get with the keyboard cover, I feel that the keyboard's gaps were likely also part of the Apple designers' plans. I am no audiophile; if I can hear it, it is not subtle.\n\n", "Q: Where did my desktop preview icons go? When I started up my MacBook today my preview icons where gone as can be seen by attached screenshot.\nAny clue why they disappeared? And how to get them back?\nThanks!\n\n\nA: On the desktop, press Command+J or select Show View Options from the View menu to bring up the view options. From there, select \"Show Icon Preview.\"\n\n", "Q: What kind of data does Spotlight index and store on OS X? With Spotlight it's possible to find almost anything on a Mac computer, but to know everything, Spotlight must keep this information somewhere.\nRegarding text (txt, doc, pages, etc,) files, Spotlight indexes not only the file name and metadata, but also the content.\nWhat kind of data does Spotlight store and how does it index text files? Does it keep metadata when the file is being deleted?\nWhen you edit work files from flash drive, does it keep index and content of that files after flash drive was removed?\n\nA: Spotlight indexes are kept in an invisible folder at the root of the indexed drive: .Spotlight-V100. When you eject a drive, its index is no longer available for searching.\nSpotlight relies on importer plug-ins to extract metadata and content from files. The system ships with importers for many common file formats. Third party applications often include importers for their proprietary file types.\nWhat information is extracted from files and given to Spotlight for indexing is left up to the developer of the importer plug-in. This often includes text content, but can really be any information about the file: author, date received, bit rate, image dimensions, ….\nFiles are re-indexed automatically when modified. Delete files disappear from the index. I would not bet on every trace of a file disappearing as soon as you delete it.\n", "Q: How do I make packages out of non-package installers? I want to use Apple Remote Desktop to install software on the Macs in our office, but often the installers come as an application bundle (not the actual application which could simply be copied, but an executable that has to be run). An example of this is Adobe Flash. Is there a way to convert or \"wrap\" this type of installer in a package so that ARD will recognise and be able to deploy them? (ARD only seems to recognise .pkg files).\n\nA: Apple has a first party Package Maker application available with Xcode. There's also Packages, a third party solution.\n", "Q: Can't empty trash on Mac Recently every time I try to delete files, my OS asks me to type in a password.  After I type in password, the files are deleted from the folder, but it doesn't free up space and the files don't show up in the trash, so I can't empty the trash.  I've tried troubleshooting different ways from searching on Google and Apple forums:\n\n\n*\n\n*I don't have Time Machine enabled.\n\n*I have OS X 10.7.5.\n\n*I've deleted over 100 GB of files, but I still only have 7 GB.\n\n*I've tried typing in Terminal:\nsudo tmutil disablelocal\n\n\n*I've tried typing in Terminal:\nresetpassword\n\n\n*I've tried typing in Terminal:\nsudo rm -r /.cleverfiles\n\nAny other suggestions will be much appreciated.  \n\nA: I have faced similar problem on one of the Macs in my office.\nI couldn't solve it directly, so I chose to delete the account, by backing up of all the important folders/files into another partition. Alternatively, you may move it out of the home folder to another folder (e.g. /Users/Shared/) temporarily. I deleted the user account and created a new one, which will solve problems with permissions, clear hidden data in the account and/or configuration problems like you are currently experiencing.\n", "Q: How to copy iTunes music from iTunes library to another, using my own music - not purchased I have digitised my CD collection and have it on my iTunes on a PC. How can I add it to my partner's iTunes on a different PC?\n\nA: You can:\n\n\n*\n\n*Send your partner the music files online (such as email)\n\n*Burn the files to a CD and transfer it to the other computer\n\n*Copy it to a thumb-drive and transfer it to the other computer\n\n\niTunes should automatically open the music files. If it does not, (I'm assuming your PC is a Windows PC) right click the file, select 'Choose default program', and then choose iTunes in the list. After opening the file in iTunes, it should automatically add it to your partner's iTunes library.\n", "Q: Flashing blue dot on Google Map I have an iphone 5S.  Sometimes when I use the Google map and enter a destination, my current location is a flashing blue dot which is very convenient.  Lately, the blue dot has been replaced with an arrow which is not as convenient.  How do I get my map to permanently show the flashing blue dot?\n\nA: The arrow is your current location, except that it also represents your current location and orientation in navigation mode.\nGoogle Maps automatically switches between the blue dot that represents your current location to an arrow in a circle when you are using the app for navigation, as you can see in the following screenshots (surroundings obscured for general privacy):\n\nRegular (non-navigation) mode, with blue dot representing current location\n\nNavigation mode, with arrow representing current location\n\n\nAs you can see, these are the defaults and I doubt they can be changed. You might just want to ensure that you aren't currently navigating anywhere (exit by tapping the 'X' at the bottom left corner) and your current location indicator should return to its usual blue dot self.\n", "Q: Make Cmd+C do both Copy and Stop in the terminal Left control Key located in a very unpleasant place on my Mac keyboard.\nIt's hard to reach in the terminal.\nLuckily, I don't need it very often: I have Cmd for most of the things.\nThere are few cases, where I need it:\nCtrl+R for reverse history search\nCtrl+C to kill a process or discard a line\nI found Karabiner and it helped with reverse history search remapping.\nBut Ctrl+C puzzles me.\nI know that on unix I can use Ctrl+C for both Stop and Copy in the terminal. And it determines what to do from the context: if there is anything selected, copy it. Otherwise, stop command or discard the user input line.\nHow I can achieve it on OS X with Cmd key?\n\nA: The temporary workaround to this\n\nIt is possible to remap keys on any program in System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > App Shortcuts. Click the plus icon, and select terminal in the application drop down. Then type the name of the function (Copy in this case), and then highlight the shortcut box, and press a desired combination. The window should look something like so:\n\nThe above is just an example. This can be applied to virtually any situation and application\n", "Q: Spotlight / Finder - search words within files and preview occurrence When searching for specific words inside documents, upon getting the results, is there a way to then preview in the document where that word occurs without having to first open the document and perform the search again within the application?\nIdeally, I'd like to hit spacebar and have the preview jump to that section of the document of the first occurrence of the word.\nWould also consider 3rd party search tools if that provided the functionality.\n\nA: I develop a file search tool that is based upon Spotlight: HoudahSpot.\nIn addition to the Quick Look preview, HoudahSpot provides a text preview. This shows a plain text version of the selected search result. If you found the file by searching for text content, text preview will automatically highlight the words you searched for and scroll to the first occurrence. You can also search within text preview.\nIf you searched by text content, HoudahSpot will also pass the text you searched for down to the application used for opening the file. In many applications you can then press command-G (find next) to highlight the first occurence of that text.\n", "Q: Can different user accounts have separate Time Machine Backup drives? If I have two users accounts on one Mac is it possible to automatically use a different Time Machine drive for each user's data?\n\nA: No, because Time Machine works at the filesystem level of the whole disk, not just the files owned by any given user. In other words, Time Machine backs up the entire Macintosh HD, sans exclusions, and doesn't know or care about individual users from this perspective.\nHave a look at: How Time Machine Works its Magic\n", "Q: Battery Life While Using External Monitor on rMBP is Less I have a  Retina Macbook Pro 2014, in clamshell mode attached to a full HD monitor.\nI see that battery lasts much less when connected to an  external monitor. Is there any explanation to why this happens? External monitor has its own power source, and Full HD is less than retina resolution.\nIs there any overhead associated the mini Display Port?\n\nA: The reason is because when you connect an external display, even if you close the laptop and use it in clamshell mode, the laptop automatically switches from an integrated video card (this uses much less power) to a more powerful, discrete video card (this uses a lot of power).\nThis is also true regarding Intel Iris Graphics, which has different power profiles (see the \"Power Management\" section). Also read on Embedded DisplayPort (eDP), and it's possibilities in terms of saving system power and further extend battery life in portable PC systems. I'm not the specialist in GPU-chips architecture, but my guess is, that the difference is exactly in using of Embedded DisplayPort on a mobile CPU, against of DisplayPort connections when on external monitor.\nSo the battery is drained more on when external monitors are connected, it needs more GPU power. Monitor itself does not drain the battery, as it's connected to external power.\n", "Q: Does Network Link Conditioner Work Well on El Capitan I had Network Link Conditioner as part of Xcode 6.1 package & was working fine. I just upgraded my to OS X El Capitan. Should I replace my NLC to the one found in Xcode 7.3 or my existing NLC of Xcode 6.1 should still be performing fine?\n\nA: Yes, It will perform as expected.\nBear in mind that the Network Link Conditioner has noting to do with Xcode itself, but with the OS. \nWhen downloading theses Hardware tools Apple points out that these graphics tools support running on [OS] which might lead you to think that and update is necessary, but the protocols and / or the way the NLC interacts with the System's connectivity, doesn't seem to have changed, as it does, indeed, work.\n", "Q: Uploading a minor new build must wait for review every time? I just fixed a few bugs and minor things after the initial version of an application was released into the app store. I've uploaded the binary to iTunesConnect but I see nowhere to change over the build version. Is it correct that every time a new version/build(1.0.1 -> 1.0.2) is uploaded it has to go through review?\n\nA: Yes.  Apple requires that every new build, regardless of how small, go thru the App Review processes.  If you have a bad bug and need to get a fix out there quickly, you can request an expedited review.\n\nA: As soon as an App has been already reviewed, uploading a new binary requires a new revision.\nExtracted from Apple's Replacing your App with a New Version:\n\nYou will only be able to add a new version for a new platform or a platform that has a Ready for Sale or Developer Removed from Sale version. If a platform version has not completed the app review process—it has a status such as Prepare For Submission or Waiting For Review—you can replace the build in the existing version instead of adding a new version. \n\n", "Q: Enter standby manually on Macbook I have set my MacBook to forget the filevault password after going into standby (not sleep) after a few hours. This works great, but sometimes I don't want to wait that long for the system to go to standby. So is there a way I can force going into standby immediately?\nI know the 'pmset sleepnow', so I was hoping there is something like 'pmset standbynow', but I cannot seem to find it.\n\nA: Standby is effectively hibernate mode, one of the several versions of sleep. It's actually possible to set the sleep mode, then call pmset sleepnow.\nLet's go over each of the sleep modes:\n0 - Old style sleep mode, with RAM powered on while sleeping, safe sleep disabled, and super-fast wake.\n1 - Hibernation mode, with RAM contents written to disk, system totally shut down while “sleeping,” and slower wake up, due to reading the contents of RAM off the hard drive. (Deprecated)\n3 - The default mode on machines introduced since about fall 2005. RAM is powered on while sleeping, but RAM contents are also written to disk before sleeping. In the event of total power loss, the system enters hibernation mode automatically.\n5 - This is the same as mode 1, but it’s for those using secure virtual memory (in System Preferences -> Security). (Deprecated)\n7 - This is the same as mode 3, but it’s for those using secure virtual memory.\n25 -  The\n     system will store a copy of memory to persistent storage (the disk), and\n     will remove power to memory. The system will restore from disk image.\nYou can get more in depth information from the man page. Please read it, it contains more in depth info.\nYou're probably after 25. It's quite easy to set your sleep mode.\nJust in case, first note down the current sleep mode in case something isn't working later. pmset -g | grep hibernatemode will tell you. Note this down somewhere. You can then set the sleep mode using sudo pmset -a hibernatemode MODE, which in you case would be sudo pmset -a hibernatemode 25.\nIf you want something that will hibernate without keeping the sleepmode as 25, you can use DeepSleep to hibernate on demand.\n\nA: You may try to set standby delay manually:\nsudo pmset hibernatemode 3 standbydelay 900\n\nThis will setup your system to turn hibernation on, copy RAM to SSD, but NOT to turn power off (this is hibernatemode 3) AFTER 15 minutes (900 seconds). Or set any desired standby delay time.\nAlternatively, you may use hibernatemode 25, which will turn hibernation on, copy RAM to SSD, and turn the power off.\nHope this will help.\n\nA: I thought of a solution by entering the command:\nsudo pmset -a hibernatemode 25; pmset sleepnow; sleep 60; sudo pmset -a hibernatemode 3\nThis sends the laptop straight to standby and restores the old settings on wake. The sleep is there to make sure the system doesn't set the old settings before standy is fully enabled. Maybe you could do with less then 60 seconds.\n", "Q: Meeting Invite Iphone I would like to be able to send a meeting invite from my iPhone/Calendar - as a text message - rather than to an email address.  Can that be done?  \n\nA: You can't directly send an invite via text message with the stock iOS calendar. \nHowever, you can send an invite to the email address of their mobile device.  For instance, if I want to send a calendar invite to someone who has an AT&T mobile number, I can send it to their number @txt.att.net.  \nThis will be seen as an email address by Calendar and you can send it out. The person receiving it will get it as a text message.  Depending on their mobile network provider, they'll be able to accept to decline the invite.  \nOf course, this requires you to know the mobile network of the people you wish to invite so it isn't perfect. There might also be 3rd-party apps on the App Store that can provide the service you're looking for but I don't have any names offhand.\n", "Q: iPhone 6s - Calendars and contacts - birthday information I have an iPhone 6s.  I want to put birthdays in my contacts however I don't want them to show up in my calendar.  I've tried everything to stop it but nothing short of taking the birthdays out of my contacts works!\n\nA: Edit: Confirmed it works\nDid you try:\n- Open the Calendar app\n- Click on 'Calendars' at the bottom\n- uncheck all birthday calendars\n\nThe birthday calendar should be under Others at the bottom\n\n\n", "Q: Cannot create new user in Single-user mode I try to create new user using the following commands:\n/sbin/fsck -fy\n/sbin/mount -uw /\nlaunchctl load /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.opendirectoryd.plist\ndscl . -create /Users/username\n\nBut after the last command I get the error /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.DirectoryServicesLocal.plist: No such file or directory. Actually, I get it on every launch of dscl command, even without any arguments. How can I fix it?\n\nA: It turned out that this error can be just ignored, because the user is properly created anyway.\n", "Q: How accurate is the location detection on the iPhone's Find My iPhone app How accurate is the GPS on the iPhone's Find My iPhone app?\nI used Find My iPhone app to track a friend. The first 3 stops were dead on but when it refreshed it showed them to be several streets over from actual location. What could cause that?\n\nA: Location in phones is a combination of:\n\n\n*\n\n*GPS (from Satellites)\n\n*Cell phone network triangulation\n\n*Often now uses Wifi assist. \n\n\nEven though it might seem like Wifi should be more accurate, GPS is best. However, it is supplemented by the other two when the GPS signal is weak.\nWhy is GPS better? GPS satellites use an atomic clock to send timestamped signals that are insanely accurate. If your phone is in position to receive 4+ strong satellite signals, most phones GPS should be accurate within 20 feet. A weak signal can quickly reduce that to 100+ feet or even 1,000+ feet!\nNow Broadcomm is said to be launching dozen of new satellites with much higher precision but it requires a new chip. The combination of those satellites and that cheap will bring precision to about a 1 foot. Source\nHowever, most of us will be using a more rudimentary GPS chip for a while. In that case, you'll continue to see wider variation, especially when signals are weak.\nThings that hurt accuracy:\n\n\n*\n\n*Not enough strong GPS satellite signals (in a tunnel, under a storm, etc)\n\n*Not near wifi\n\n*Weak cell signal\nNow your phone actually knows how accurate it is. Some apps increase the radius circle to reflect the strength/weakness of the combination of signal strengths. The Apple API tells iOS apps about signal strength using a 1-5 rating.\nImportant note: Wifi assisted GPS is worth looking up. My understanding is that it's not about networks you join, just networks your phone picks up on. Your phone sends data back to the maps company, reporting locations of wifi networks detected. In a city with hundreds of networks on a single street, that data starts to form a wifi map that works well when the maps app has no/weak GPS.\nYour GPS accuracy can change by the second. Satellites are flying around the Earth at thousands of miles per hour, so at any given second one GPS satellite might be falling out of range and (hopefully) another may be coming into range. So you might think you want privacy, but the next time that Google Maps dot is jumping around think about how nice it would be if satellites were actually following you! \nPrivacy... just a GPS circle you can't live completely in, but can't live completely outside of!\nNow the list of variables just keeps going here. Another example would be your phone's battery. If your battery is low, your phone might start powering down non-essential services or checking-in less to save processing power. Background threads are likely the first to be throttled down in low power mode.\nAnyways, hope this helps. It's probably just scratching the surface of why your GPS location might seem a bit erratic.\n\nA: It's the same accuracy as the GPS accuracy of the device. If the GPS on the iPhone can't obtain a good signal, it may use Wi-Fi triangulation which will reduce the accuracy.\nGPS accuracy may be decreased depending on the phone's environment (i.e. a tunnel would not have great GPS, but standing in an open field would).\n\nA: iPhone fell off my belt riding a motorbike across an enormous field at a model airplane contest. Got a friend with a laptop with a hotspot, linked my iPad to it, and got the location of the phone with the Find My iPhone app. Once we got close, started calling the phone. I’m pretty hard of hearing so the volume was all the way up. Found it in about 15 minutes. I’m very pleased! \n\nA: The generic answer you can find at Apple support website\n\nAbout location precision or accuracy\nDepending on your device and available services, Location Services uses a combination of cellular, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and GPS to determine your location. If you're not within a clear line of sight to GPS satellites, your device can determine your location using crowd-sourced Wi-Fi and cell tower locations or iBeacons.\n\nIf you want to have specific numbers, in meters, approximately they would be next (according to the 2009 study):\n\n*\n\n*3G iPhone w/ A-GPS ~ 8 meters\n\n*3G iPhone w/ WiFi ~ 74 meters\n\n*3G iPhone w/ Cellular positioning ~ 600 meters\n\nIn 2011 Dr. Zandbergen tested several Android smart phones. Here he found the accuracies to be slightly better than the 2009 study. They ranged from 5-8 meters. It is likely that the iPhone 4S/5 is within this range as well. It can also be assumed that iPads and other Android tablets will be comparable.\n\nA: I don't know about the positioning between cell towers and satellites, but I was having problems with getting an accurate reading/position of my sons iPhone (1-2 mile variance).\nI took off the plastic cell phone case he had on it, and what do you know: it dialed right in to his exact position (1-2 yards). So try changing phone cases to see if it makes a difference, it did in my case.\n\nA: The Find my iPhone location can be off by up to 600m. In my case, this was because my phone was in a steel and concrete structure (high rise). If you look at your location on a GPS-enabled application (other than Google Maps) and zoom in, you will see your location is distorted.\n\nA: GPS doesn't use Satellites. \nIt is all ground based antenna arrays. \nCells use mostly cell tower triangulation. \n\nA: Sometimes it is way, way off. By a mile or two.\n", "Q: Dock doesn't disappear before reboot Every time when I'm trying to reboot my mac(macbook pro retina|el capitan), everything disappear except dock so the process stops and thats how my desktop looks:\n\nA: Have you tried removing some of the items from your dock?  You can always add them back later. Also go under your Apple Icon in the top left corner to the force quit option and see if there is a application open somewhere you're not aware and force quit it.  Finally, look in your system preferences for the Dock. You can choose to hide the Dock to only appear when your cursor goes to the bottom of the screen. I doubt that would solve your problem though.  I have my Dock on the left side of my screen and it is hidden, that way I can see the entire screen and only access the Dock when I need to open an application.  Good luck.\n", "Q: Tools to monitor App files write activity under OS X What tools can be used to monitor system activity under OS X? I am interested in which files are modified or created while using a specific app, Safari to be exact. I am familiar with fs_usage, but I find it cumbersome, since I do not want to monitor read actions, just write.\n\nA: Instruments is a tool that comes with Xcode.  This tool was designed to help developers get a lot of detail about what was happening on a computer when their software is run.  One of the things it can do is watch all file I/O.  If you run the program and add the File I/O instrument, you can attach it to safari and see what happens.  You can also filter and sort the output.\nMore information can be found on the Xcode page from Apple.\n\nA: I will edit my answer with hyperlinks whence not on my phone, but..\na. The built-in OSX utility,sudo iotop, provides a greppable stream of all fsevents... \n\nand / or\nb. FSEventer.app provides a nice GUI around roughly the same info as the aforementioned ...

I have noticed that the spinning network activity indicator doesn't always show up when I know it's using the network. For example, I have my iPhone SE and my iPad 2 both downloading iOS 9.3.2 right now. The icon shows on the iPad but not on the iPhone. And then when I start typing a question in Stack Exchange, the phone does show the network being used as it searches similar questions but when the search is done, the icon goes away even though the phone is still downloading over WiFi. Searching for tags, though, it does not show the indicator. What is the cause?\n\nA: Bear in mind that the visibility of Network Activity Indicator is managed by the App's Developer and not the System detecting a connection. \nThat being said, there are numerous reasons for this behaviours you're experiencing. Perhaps the Apps were coded to react differently to different actions, or they wrongly hide the Network Activity Indicator despite the fact a connection is being made.\n"]
