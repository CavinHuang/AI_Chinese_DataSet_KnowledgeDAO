["Q: \"Automatically install new apps\" not working I've got \"Automatically install new apps\" checked on all my iDevices, but it hardly ever does what it says.  For example, I just downloaded three new apps to my computer and then did a Sync operation on two iPads and an iPhone -- none of the new apps showed up.  On the App List, they each showed the button as Install.  When I pressed the Install button on the App List for each of the affected apps, they then installed on the next Sync.\nJust to keep me guessing, new apps WILL occasionally install correctly, but I've never figured out what magic circumstance triggered the proper behavior.\nIdeas?\n\nA: Apple is not doing very good programming lately, they have shifted their resources to making iOS look pretty. They are not enterprise ready yet and this is just one example, I have ran into this issue about 20 times and its such a time consuming task to manually click update or install on each iPad, because you can hold the command key and clicking one app will automatically highlight all, but yes the automatically install new apps checkmark should do all this for you, applause for Apple's software team on their historic buggy software releases.\nI am not 100% on this but make sure your restrictions allow apps to be deleted and install apps is allowed, and delete all caches in the users library, reboot, try again.. sorry if that doesnt help.. \n", "Q: How can I change the iOS App Store Country on my iPhone 5?

OK, I'm extremely frustrated as someone who is not all that technologically astute, and I tried to solve my iCloud syncing problem by looking here, but I truly don't have the first idea how Byword's and RTF files (rich-text) sync works. \nI too have the dotted lines showing that documents are not saved to the cloud.\nI have just been using the iCloud for document and PowerPoint presentation the same way I have used it over the past 10 months since I got my Mac, iPad and iPhone. It has always been syncing up to this point.\nNow, my iPad and iPhone are syncing but not with the Mac and the Mac is just putting a document in the iCloud which sits there with the \"waiting\" dotted cloud around it. \nIt has been waiting for over a week.  What am I doing wrong?\n\nA: The dotted lines mean iCloud is trying to sync the file with its remote servers. This might be due to temporary issues with iCloud services (see this Apple System Status), or that your Mac iCloud configuration has been corrupted and needs to be reset. As you say it has been waiting for over a week, I'm guessing it is the latter.\nIn such cases, what has worked for me in the past is to save any files waiting for sync  to my desktop, and then reset iCloud with the instruction below. To reset iCloud on your Mac, open Terminal.app (/Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app) and execute the following instructions:\nmv ~/Library/Mobile\\ Documents/ ~/Desktop/iCloud\\ Backup\nrm -rf ~/Library/Application\\ Support/Ubiquity/peer-* \nkillall ubd\n\nCopy and paste each line to Terminal.app then press the Return key. First line, will create a backup of all your iCloud documents in your Desktop folder. Second line, will delete the original documents to force a clean slate on the iCloud. Third line, will force a restart on the iCloud sync process (ubd) and recreate all your iCloud documents. Once that's done, I open the backed up files and move then again to iCloud and they sync fine.\nAs an aside, in defense of 3rd party developers, this is rarely a problem of the host app using iCloud, as the process responsible for the iCloud sync (ubd) belongs to OS X.\nNonetheless, it's important to note that Byword for iOS does not support RTF files. This means that even though your RTF files can be synced to iCloud, they won't appear on your iOS devices—only on other Macs. The description on the App Stores says:\n\n⚠ Important note\n  Byword for iOS only works with plain text formats. Supported file extensions are: txt, text, md, mmd, markdown, markdn, mdown, mkdn, markd and fountain.\n\nAnd the first question on Byword support FAQ also mentions this.\n", "Q: Specific wifi router type? for rMBP? I've recently gotten my cable internet upgraded. When the tech was here, he was able to get about 48 Mbps speeds over wifi, but on my retina MBP, connecting to the same wireless router, I was only getting 30-35.\nWe tried a number of different configurations, various wifi channels, and turning off the bluetooth on my machine.\nHow can i diagnose wireless prrformance to learn if a particular router type may work better with my Mac?\n\nA: You shouldn't need to disable bluetooth on any recent Apple product - their antennas and drivers are very well engineered, and if you can demonstrate a slow down, you could get it repaired (most likely under warranty) since that's not normal. It is good troubleshooting - especially if your router is on 2.4 GHz.\nFirst off, there may not be a problem. If you hold down the option key when you select the Wireless icon in the menu bar - take note of the transmit rate, MCS and other data.\n\n\n*\n\n*What PHY mode is your radio? \n\n*What band is your router? \n\n*What MCS is being employed between the Mac and the base station?\n\n\nSecondly, you can run the tests with the Wi-Fi Diagnostic that sits in /System/Library/CoreServices to check on the logs, check signal to noise ratio and much more.\nIf you are regularly transferring large amounts of data, you might need the higher MCS data rates - but it's rare to find a modern router (AirPort, Cisco/Linksys, etc…) that doesn't work very well with Macs. Usually it's an interference issue with spectrum and not that the hardware isn't properly matched. It's hard to tell without doing the work several days in a row to collect network conditions and graphs - but hopefully this helps you decide if/when to get a new router if that's the solution you choose.\n", "Q: Can I change \"All Songs\" order in iPhone 4s Music app? My iPhone Music collection has several albums by the same artist.  When I select that artist in the Music app I see these albums listed, & \"All Songs\" at the top.  When I select \"All Songs\" the songs are listed in alphabetical order on track name.\nIs it possible to change the \"All Songs\" order to keep albums together, eg alpha on album name (or numeric on album year), & then by track number within each album?  This seems like the most likely way you'd want to play all songs by an artist, so I'm surprised it's not the default & that I can't find a way to do this.\n\n\nA: The answer to this question is incredibly simple, and needs no elaboration other than enough to justify the size of the post and prevent Stack Exchange from automatically marking it as low quality or affecting it. That answer?\nNo, you can't. The All Songs section of an artist view, exactly like the all Songs category on iOS, is always by alphabetical title.\n\nA: Yep software not written by a music lover.\nYou have to create a new playlist, then select artists and your artist, then select all songs and they will be in the album order about 6 or more keystrokes \n", "Q: Select statements in Apple Numbers '09 I've got a table as follows\n| Name       | Year  | Price |\n|____________|_______|_______|\n| Foo        | 2013  | $10   |\n| Bar        | 2009  | $3    |\n| Baz        | 2010  | $100  |\n\nWhat I'd really like to be able to do is a select * from table where [Year] <= CurrentYear\nSince this is a spreadsheet and not a database, I'm wondering if there's any way to do this? Is there any way to do select statements in Numbers '09?\n\nA: No SQL or database connections plug into a Numbers file, so you would need to export it and get the data into a SQLite database on the filesystem or otherwise get it into something that has SQL query.\n", "Q: How to move all of my mails to external HD and make them appear only when its connected I have 200 GB of mails, and I would like to place them in an external hard drive, and to make the appear, in the Mail.app, only when this external HD is connected. \nIs this possible? \n\nA: Confirming your requirement.\nYou want to remove all (or specific account) emails (from mail.app) from your hard drive and move them to a external drive. (this is not to have a copy of your emails on the hard drive).\nThan you want the Mail.app to use that external drive from now on as email database.\nOne way to accomplish this is as follows:\nIt is called symbolic link. What it does is you create a link in your mail so it looks for your emails on the external drive.\nStep 1: Find the file you need to move and move it.\nThe Mail files are stored in /Users//Mail and /Users//Mail Downloads. To get to these files, open a new finder window and press Command+Shift+G and type “/Users/(YOU)/Library/” . This takes you to the Library folder, where you’ll see both Mail and Mail Downloads. Grab both of those files and move them to your external drive.\nStep 2: Delete the files you moved from the Library folder. (if you worry about deleting then just move to desktop for now). In other words, make it so that the files do NOT exist in your Library folder, but they DO exist on your external drive.\nStep 3: Create a Symbolic Link to the folders on the external drive.\nDownload the SymbolicLinker App and install it by clicking the “SymbolicLinker.service” file within the DMG file. Once installed, you can then go to the files on the external drive, right click and select “Make Symbolic Link” at the very bottom of the menu. This will create a folder right next to the actual folder.\nStep 4: Move the Symbolic links to the Library folder. If you’ve already closed the Library folder window, re-open with the instructions from Step 1. Once open, drag the symlink files on the external hard drive that you created in Step 3, over to the Library folder. Once they’re both in the library folder rename them so they have the EXACT same name as the actual files did (in other words, remove the “symlink” at the end of the file name).\nIf you’ve followed all the steps you should now have links in the Library folder that point to the actual folders that are now on the external drive. From here on, it’d probably be a bad idea to rename your external drive. You might be able to without it breaking, but it doesn’t sound like it’d be a good idea (test first). Also, if the external drive isn’t mounted on the OS (it’s not plugged in) then you’ll be unable to open Mail (since the files for Mail are on the external drive now). \nCopyright 2003-2011 Nick Zitzmann.\n", "Q: How can I remap the play/pause key to Grooveshark? I like to listen to Grooveshark while coding on my mbp.  Since it's a website, every time I want to pause or continue I need to find the tab in my browser and click with the trackpad.\nIs there a way to remap the F8/Play-Pause key to provide this functionality?\nHitting this key currently brings up iTunes, which I never use.\nI'm open to any scripting and/or coding solutions, if it comes to that.\n\nA: It is possible for Desktop apps to take control of the play/pause key. Spotify, the Last.FM desktop scrobbler, and a few other apps I've used have all allowed the play/pause media key to work with their app in Mountain Lion. However, browsers will probably never allow websites to register key handling on a global level, because this is an incredibly large security risk. Imagine if a site registered a global handler for all your standard keyboard keys.\nI don't believe this is possible. Maybe some combination of browser scripting will allow you to use hotkey software like KeyRemap4Macbook to run an Applescript that finds a tab on the domain grooveshark.com with the status playing, and sends a javascript command into the page to pause it.\nBut if GrooveShark is 100% flash based, (and IIRC it is,) you're completely out of luck.\nGrooveShark needs an app. A native, first-party OS X app that can actually take advantage of modern desktop APIs. Until then, I don't believe this is possible.\n", "Q: How to quick switch OSX proxy on/off?

It shipped with Lion. I want to reinstall the OS on the laptop without an internet connection. Is this possible on these newer machines? What are the steps?\nUse-case:\nThe main purpose of the Macbook Air is to use it on the road when i travel. recently, I was testing my client's app on it and made lots of changes to the OS settings. Experimentation led to instability and the fastest way to get back is to reinstall the OS to a fresh start. I want it to be possible from a placewith out internet as well. On top of  it, I just realized that I can't reinstall OS X even with wifi using the recovery console, it led to the screen saying 'Could not find installation information for this machine. Contact AppleCare'. I paid a per-incident AppleCare call and they said they do not support non-internet recovery anymore and I have to take it to a care center to reinstall the OS for me(in the post laptop era, owner has no control of OS installation any more). Probably I have to end up paying to reinstall OS X, but I think I would use a disk cloner from now on.\n\nA: You could make a bootable drive with the Lion installer. To do so, you'll need the original Lion Installer, downloadable from the Mac App Store once you've purchased it and a USB flash drive with a GUID Partition Table format. You'll find here a step by step guide for the formatting part. Afterwards just:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to the Applications folder and find the installer, which should be called Install Mac OSX Lion.app.\n\n*Right+click on it and choose Show Package Content from the contextual menu.\n\n*Under Contents / Shared Support you'll find a file called InstallESD.dmg, drag it to Disk Utilities' sidebar and mount it. \n\n*Select the installer and click the Restore button. \n\n*The installer should appear in the Source field, if not, drag it there.\n\n*Connect the USB and drag it into the Destination field.\n\n*Click Restore.\n\n\nIf everything was done correctly, you'll, then, have a drive from which you'll be able to boot just by holding C while restarting your computer.\n\nA: If your onboard recovery partition is not working you can easily reinstall it by simply downloading and running this app from Apple. \nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/dl1464\n\nA: I'm ignoring the OP's problem, but you can normally reinstall OS X from the recovery partition without needing any external drive.\nTo erase and reinstall OS X:\n\n\n*\n\n*Start from the recovery partition by holding command-R on startup\n\n*Erase the OS X partition from Disk Utility\n\n*Choose Install OS X\n\n\nTo reinstall OS X without erasing the current installation:\n\n\n*\n\n*Start from the recovery partition by holding command-R on startup\n\n*Choose Reinstall OS X\n\n\nSee these Apple KB articles:\nOS X Lion: Erase and reinstall Mac OS X\nOS X Mountain Lion: Erase and reinstall OS X\nOS X Mavericks: Erase and reinstall OS X\nOS X Lion: Reinstall Mac OS X\nOS X Mountain Lion: Reinstall OS X\nOS X Mavericks: Reinstall OS X\nOS X: About OS X Recovery\n\nA: I would suggest the following:\nBecause it might be hard to find the Lion Installer, consider anyway to upgrade to OS X Yosemite, which is a much faster and polished OS and since you are on Lion I don't see any reason to stay there.\nDownload the Yosemite installer through AppStore. It's free.\nPurchase a flash drive 16GB or 32GB. Format it with GUID partition and install Yosemite on it. After installation, remember to also put a copy of the Yosemite installer on the flash drive.\nAlso upgrade your macbook air to Yosemite. \nNow you can boot your mac through the flash drive and can run Yosemite installer anytime. You will also have access to the disk utilities in order to format your internal drive if needed.\nNote, that if you have enough hard-disk space in your mac, you could just split it into 2 partitions and do the above instead of using the flash drive. It will be generally faster as a procedure. The cons are that  it will reserve hard-disc space and also you wont' be able to format the full disc. Also, it won't help you if your hard-disk encounter bigger issues or mechanical problems and need a complete format or replace.\n", "Q: Can you use any application whilst it is being updated Is it possible to use any application while it is being updated from the Mac App Store?\n\nA: Under System Preferences / Software Update you can choose Automatically check for updates which will enable the Download newly available updates in the background option. \nThis is quite self-explanatory. It will just download the update, letting you use the application while the download is active, and when the download is complete, you'll be prompted, through Notification Center, to Install the update.\n", "Q: Do apps placed in the background consume resources? I've heard that leaving open apps on an iPhone, affects the duration of the battery's charge. Is this true and documented, or some of an urban legend? And does it affects other apps' performance?\n\nA: Third parties Apps which are placed on the background won't actively consume resources unless they provide either Location Services, Audio playback or VoIP. As stated on Apple's iOS App Programming Guide:\n\nIn iOS, only specific app types are allowed to run in the background:\n\n*\n\n*Apps that play audible content to the user while in the background, such as a music player app.\n\n*Apps that keep users informed of their location at all times, such as a navigation app.\n\n*Apps that support Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP).\n\n*Newsstand apps that need to download and process new content.\n\n*Apps that receive regular updates from external accessories.\n\n\nThere are, tough, some Apple services which will, too, run on the background and consume resources, such as Photo Stream (upload / download), App Store downloads or even push notifications.\nIn the case you've got a lot of backgrounded Apps, and the currently open one is running out of resources, iOS will, automatically, close some Apps freeing memory.

I bought a new Macbook running Lion, trying to migrate from an old Macbook running Snow Leopard. At my temporary housing, the two machines were able to find each other over migration assistant, but since the network is so unreliable (it took 30 minutes just to connect each machine), I can't use it for migration. At work, we have an excellent wifi, but the two machines can't find each other in the migration assistant (despite being able to ping each other). Any guesses as to why?\n\nA: My first guess is that your work's network configuration could be blocking Bonjour broadcasts. But in my experience doing a migration over WiFi can be a bit flaky anyway. Try it several times and maybe it will eventually work.\nInstead of using WiFi, I would recommend using a wired connection if possible. It will go many times faster. If both computers have an ethernet port you can just connect them directly to each other with an ethernet cable. Or you can connect them via FireWire or Thunderbolt if you have one of those cables.\nIf only one computer has ethernet, try plugging that computer in via ethernet and connecting to WiFi with the other. That will help the speed and reliability. \n\nA: Another solution would be to create a new TimeMachine backup on a erased USB external drive and then run Migration Assistant using the TimeMachine option. If you don't have a USB drive, you can get them relatively inexpensively on-line or at a big-box office supply store. Its nice to have one or two spare drives like this in the toolkit. I've done this type of migration several times for myself and others.\nHave a glass of wine and make dinner while the backup finishes, then eat dinner and dessert while the migration occurs. No need to hurry things.\n", "Q: Adding a song file to iTunes via the command line without playing the file I want to add song files to iTunes via the command line. \n    open -a iTunes -g song.mp3\n\ndoes exactly this. - However it starts playing the song, too.

But, how do I make for the TextMate icon to appear while in Finder's icon mode too?\nI'm using Mountain Lion, if that makes any difference.\n\nA: You must go to settings -> icons settings -> set files icons.\n\nA: Select any .js file and press \"Command+i\".\nGo to \"Open with\".\nSelect TextMate 2 from the drop down and click \"Change all\".\nNow you can see the TM icons in finder.\n", "Q: Add to Existing Contact from Mail.app to Contacts.app I am looking for an option to add the choice \"Add to Existing Contact\" from the Apple Mail.app From address field.  As you all know, we have \"Copy Address, Add to VIPs, New Email, Add to Contacts, and Services\" as current choices.  I am hoping that I can find a way to have an additional choice of \"Add to Existing Contact\" to this list - maybe listed under Services.\nI know that this is a choice when you use the smart detection feature from a signature.  I also know this is an option in iOS 6. So how can I get the same functionality for From: addresses in Mail.app?\n\nA: This is a quick look at this,. which means it can either be refined or there is a better answer.\nI will assume you know how to create an automator service.

Is there a way to install modules from CPAN without resorting to sudo?\n(And without perlbrew, please.)\n\nA: You can configure cpan to install modules outside of the system default path. Point it to some place under your home directory and you shouldn't need to call it with sudo to install modules.\nThe o command in the cpan interactive shell lets you change options for cpan and the makepl_arg option changes the options that are passed to the perl Makefile.pl call that CPAN makes to build the Makefile for the module.\nIf you wanted to change the install path to ~/lib/perl5 you'd do:\nmkdir -p ~/lib/perl5\nperl -MCPAN -e shell\n\nAnd from the CPAN shell:\ncpan> o conf makepl_arg 'PREFIX=~/lib/perl5'\ncpan> install MyModule\n\nTo use modules installed in this location you'll need to add this path to your PERL5LIB environment variable. For bash do:\nexport PER5LIB=~/lib/perl5\n\nOr whatever environment variable setting syntax is required by your shell of choice.\nThere's a nice discussion of customizing CPAN for a single user here.\n", "Q: Is it safe to reformat drive during Recovery Mode install? I've inherited an almost brand new 13\" Macbook Pro Retina. I'd like wipe the hard drive clean and start with a fresh install of Mountain Lion. I've done this a million times before... but never while booted from the Recovery Partition. So I just thought I'd have someone who has experience with this check my math here. \nTake a look at the following photo of the Mac booted into Recovery mode with Disk Utility running. Can I safely click on the \"500.25 GB APPLE SSD S...\", go to the Erase tab, wipe it completely clean, and then use it as the target for the install? Will that keep the Recovery Partition intact? \n\nSeems reasonable to me... but I've been advised against this approach. I've also used Apple's Recovery Disk Assistant to make a bootable USB stick just in case. Is there any reason that I should boot off of and install from that instead?\nBonus Question: When I'm erasing and reformatting disks, I never know if I should click on \"500.25 GB APPLE SSD S...\" or \"Macintosh HD\". Thoughts?\n\nA: The difference between the 500gb and Mac HD is pretty simple actually. The parent is the actual hard drive that holds the partition (Mac HD). You use that to re-partition if you want to split or change the partition table.\nSo you should use the Mac HD if you just want to erase and install.\nThe disk1 in your screenshot is the recovery partition. You probably can't erase it or remove it (not sure as I haven't tried). The icon indicates that it is a mounted drive and not an actual hard drive.\nSo click the Macintosh HD, erase, format, target for install. It's not long ago I did the same on my MacBook Pro.\nHappy fresh laptop!\n", "Q: Keeping the mac awake when running certain applications? I need to keep my MacBook Air awake when running certain applications. But when I put the display to sleep, often the whole system suspends after a few minutes.\nSpecifically I run Air Video Server on the Mac to stream/decode videos to my iPad. But the Mac keeps sleeping and thus stopping streaming videos. \nI tried to use Caffeine to keep the Mac awake, but it looks like it has lost its magic in Mountain Lion – it couldn't keep the Mac awake to continue running services after I put the display to sleep.\nWimoweh (another sleep-preventing app) couldn't detect whether Air Video server is running, so it's probably won't be useful in this situation.\nSo is there any other app that can keep a Mac running services with the display asleep? I'm not keen to install OS X Server on this laptop since it's more of a once-in-a-while thing and most of the time I need the Air to really sleep if it's unused.\n\nA: I use caffeine to avoid the system to sleep, you can configure the time is \"awake\" as well: http://lightheadsw.com/caffeine/\nEdit to update as caffeine hasn't been updated for a long time, Amphetamine seems to work OK https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/amphetamine/id937984704?mt=12\n\nA: You can use KeepingYouAwake. It is a free and lightweight menu bar utility for macOS (Version 10.10 and newer) that can prevent your Mac from entering sleep mode for a predefined duration or as long as it is activated.\nIt can be easily installed using Homebrew cask by running:\nbrew cask install keepingyouawake\nIt is an alternative to widely popular tool Caffeine from Lighthead Software. Caffeine hasn't been updated in a while. KeepingYouAwake's icons are Retina-compatible and do look nice in the dark themed menu bar.\nOnce you have activated KeepingYouAwake, you can simply lock the screen (by pressing Control + Command + q), turn down the screen brightness and remain assured that the system won't go to sleep!\n", "Q: original iPad not charging Ok, I just bought a brand new original iPad. Sounds impossible, right? Well, we just opened the box, and it is not even charging. There is no indication that this iPad even works even though it is technically \"new.\" Is this something that Apple will need to fix or do I just need to let it sit on the charger overnight and hope it wakes up from a 2 year sleep in its box?\n\nA: To sum up:\n\n\n*\n\n*When the battery of an iOS device is fully depleted, it needs a few minutes of charging before it turns on.\n\n*You need to use original cable and adapter\n\n*If charging an iPad, use the wall outlet instead of laptop's USB port when possible.\n\n\nA: Did you buy this from Apple? If so, have it replaced. It comes with a 1 year warranty. About the issue: Leave it plugged in over night. Sometimes iOS devices (especially iPads I've noticed) appear to be nothing more than a paper weight even after an hour of \"charging\". Sometimes they power back up after a while, sometimes they don't. If it doesn't, and it's not under warranty, I'd replace the battery.\n", "Q: Syncing iPad with iPhone I have an iPhone and recently purchased an iPad, and I'd like to sync all the song's I've already got in my iPhone, into my iPad. How can I do this?\nI have iTunes but cant seem to sync.\n\nA: *\n\n*Make sure you have all of your iPhone songs already loaded in your iTunes library. If you previously synced iTunes on your computer with your iPhone, this is most certainly the case. \n\n*Connect your iPad to your computer and run iTunes\n\n*In your iPad from within iTunes, navigate to the \"Music\" tab and make sure that the \"Sync music\" and \"Entire library\" options are ticked. \n\n*Click on the Apply button. \nYour iTunes library songs will now be pushed to your iPad. \nYou can alternatively enable iTunes match on both your iPhone and your iPad, and have iTunes Match push your iPhone songs to your iPad.

When I create Smart Mailboxes they work just as one would expect them to. When I quit Mail and re-open it, they're gone as if I would have never created them. I found a similar issue with an earlier version of Mac OS X where deleting the SmartMailboxesSomething.plist in ~/Library/Mail/ fixed the problem.

Both are running OS X's latest version.\nAnyone know how to fix this?\nThanks!\n— Flo\n\nA: I filed a radar (rdar://13700673) with Apple and after a few mails back and forth they figured out how to solve the problem:\nchmod -a 'everyone deny write,delete,append,writeattr,writeextattr,chown' ~/Library/Mobile\\ Documents/com~apple~mail/Data/MailData/* ~/Library/Mobile\\ Documents/com~apple~mail/Data/MailData/Signatures/*\n\nLooks like I had some permission issues on that files.\n\nA: I would troubleshoot by quitting Mail, moving all Mail app preferences to desktop, and restarting Mail. \n", "Q: Are Bash, Bourne, and Korn shells compiled into one binary in OSX? On OSX 10.8, if you compare the binaries for bash, sh, and ksh, a few different shell options, they are the same size.  If you take it further and cmp the binaries, there seems to be only a single-byte difference between the binaries.\nThis superficially seems to indicate that all of the code to support all of the different shells is available in each binary, but which subset you have access to depends on which shell you end up executing.\n\n\n*\n\n*Can anyone confirm that the binaries are in fact compiled this way? \n\n*From Apple's point of view, is their any benefit in combining all of the shells in this manner?\n\n\nA: ksh and bash are completely different, but the bash and sh binaries are mostly identical. OS X's sh is a version of bash that:\n\n\n*\n\n*Has POSIX mode enabled. bash doesn't comply to POSIX by default.\n\n*Has different startup behavior. For example sh -l doesn't read ~/.bash_profile/.\n\n*Has xpg_echo enabled by default. So echo acts like echo -e and it doesn't support any options.\n\n\nThe default FCEDIT is ed in sh but EDITOR or ed in bash:\n$ diff -y --suppress-common-lines -W 80 <(strings /bin/bash) <(strings /bin/sh)\n                                      > /bin/bash\n${FCEDIT:-${EDITOR:-ed}}              | ${FCEDIT:-ed}\n@(#)PROGRAM:bash  PROJECT:bash-86.1   | @(#)PROGRAM:sh  PROJECT:bash-86.1\n$ grep -rF '${FCEDIT:-${EDITOR:-ed}}' ~/Code/Source/bash-86.1/\nbash-86.1/bash-3.2/builtins/fc.c:#  define POSIX_FC_EDIT_COMMAND \"${FCEDIT:-${EDITOR:-ed}}\"\nbash-86.1/bash-3.2/builtins/fc.def:#  define POSIX_FC_EDIT_COMMAND \"${FCEDIT:-${EDITOR:-ed}}\"\n\nThe source can be downloaded from http://opensource.apple.com/tarballs/.\nFrom man bash:\n\nIf bash is invoked with the name sh, it tries to mimic the startup behavior of historical versions of sh as closely as possible, while conforming to the POSIX standard as well.\n\nIt doesn't emulate other aspects of the original Bourne shells though.\nThe original Bourne shells are no longer maintained, and /bin/sh is now meant to be some other shell that just complies to POSIX. OS X's sh allows using bashisms that don't necessarily work with the /bin/sh on other platforms (like dash on Ubuntu).\n\nA: I think your basic assumption is wrong.

When I move a large file between folders, I notice that Time Machine takes a long time on the next hourly backup. Apparently, it is quite stupid and considers a file move just like a deletion and an addition of a completely new file...\nSince my backups are getting quite large, I'd like to shrink them by removing duplicate files across the backup sets. Would it be safe to simply run fdupes or a similar program on the backup sets? If not, would it be reasonable to instead use some custom script that replaces each found dupe with a hardlink to the duped file?\n\nA: No, you cannot run most deduplicator applications on a time-machine backup. \nTime machine makes extensive use of hard-links internally. Any application that is not aware of this will find hundreds or thousands of false duplicates (which are really hard-links to the same file), and proceed to hose your time machine backup. Apple also seems to do some filesystem-specific stuff in the backup too, which is why it needs to be on a HFS+ volume (either a entire drive, or a .sparseimage on a network share).\nA lot of the complexity within the time machine mechanism is poorly or undocumented entirely, and if you break something, time machine will simply not work, without any meaningful documentation. If your deduplicator is hard-link aware, it may work, but it has equal chances of hosing something, from which you cannot recover. \nReally, there does not seem to be any decent tools for managing time-machine images, unfortunately.\n", "Q: Manually Set Location Services Location My iMac rarely has WiFi turned on since I use Ethernet, however Location Services seem to need a WiFi connection (they both connect to the same router, so I fail to see the logic there… but there we go).\nIs there a way to override or set my location so that apps which use Location Services can still get a location?\n\nA: You can set a custom location in Google Chrome's developer tools.\nPress ⌥⌘I+Esc, then go to the Emulation tab and set your custom longitude and latitude.\n\n\nA: It seems that you can need wifi on (but not necessarily configured) in order to get location, Core Location works using skyhook and will not function without wifi on. This is not well documented by Apple but this StackOverflow conversation covers it. \nAccording to the above, you should be able to turn on Wifi, wait for a location fix and then turn it off. \nIf that doesn't work look into WhereAmI, this project allows command line access to CoreLocation and you should be able to script it and wifi to turn on once in a while, log your location and then turn wifi off.\n\nA: If your machine or devices don't broadcast some type of radio signal how do you expect it to determine your location? The logic is that Wi-Fi, GPS, or cellular towers can be used to bounce signals back and forth between you and them to pinpoint where you're at. Without broadcasting a signal somehow it wouldn't know if you were 10 ft. away from the router or on a VPN connection 3k miles away,\nThe only thing you can really do for what you're asking is to turn on your location services temporarily and when you're done turn them off.\n• More Info\n", "Q: why can i add files to my ipod but not my iphone?

If I delete photos on my camera roll on my iphone 4s will it delete the photos on photo stream on my macbook pro?\n\nA: It shouldn't. The Camera Roll and your Photo Stream \"live\" in separate places. \nI just did a test with this. I placed the same photo in both the Photo Stream and the Camera Roll and then deleted the copy from the Camera Roll. The one in the Photo Stream stayed in place.\n", "Q: How do I tell if my Apple hardware is covered by AppleCare? My iPhone's lock screen button isn't behaving well and I'd like to take it to the Apple Store to get it replaced. I'm fairly certain I bought AppleCare on it, but the receipt and anything that might indicate I made that purchase are locked away in a storage locker and far from convenient to find.\nIs there a way to determine if any piece of Apple hardware is currently under warranty or covered by an AppleCare plan without having the original purchase receipt?\n\nA: Apple's self-solve web portal can tell you whether any Apple product is currently under warranty or covered by an AppleCare plan. It can also tell you when the coverage ends and help you setup an appointment to get your problem looked in to.\nYou'll need to know the serial number for your Apple product to look up the coverage. There's an Apple support article on how to find this identifier for all the different bits of hardware Apple makes.\n\n", "Q: \"@\" symbol in password in applescript I am using an applescript to mount a users home folder.

After it got considerably hot, I unplugged the Ethernet cable. The cable is CAT5e (not CAT6 for gigabit ethernet) and a rather cheap one and I sincerely hope that this is the reason for the heating problem. Is it so? Any ideas?\n\nA: It depends on what you were doing on the Mac. For instance, if you were doing a lot photo editing the heat build up in that area is normal. This is where the power adapter plugs in and the internal heat-sink is located. The more power processor needed the hotter that area becomes. Not to worry though, the built cooling system in the Mac will take care of the heat buildup.\n\nA: Did unplugging the ethernet resolve the problem? You can't isolate causality without testing the heat (under the same conditions i.e. same apps in use) with the ethernet unplugged. More than likely that is just normal processor heat.\n", "Q: Can I configure my iPhone to play audio files through ear speaker instead of the bottom speaker? My company utilizes a voicemail system which sends audio files as email attachments. These audio files playback via QuickTime in iOS which pushes the audio out via the phone's speaker. Which is great for a Mumford and Sons song, not so great for voicemail. I can hook up headphones for private listening, but when I am without headphones wanted to use the phone's ear speaker instead.\nUsing an iPhone 5 and iOS 6 is it possible to play audio files played back via QuickTime with the ear speaker? If not via QuickTime is there an app for that?\n\nA: No you can't. \nAnd as far as I can tell (searching the App Store) there are no apps that can help you. Even if there was one you wouldn't be able to open the audio file in Mail without using QuickTime, and that will always lead to the audio file playing through speaker. \nBest you can do is have a pair of headphones with you and hope something changes in the future. \n\nA: It is technically possible, the Google Voice for iPhone app does this when you listen to voicemails\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-voice/id318698524?mt=8\n\nA: *\n\n*Settings > Accessibility > Audio/Visual\n\n*Turn \"Mono Audio\" on\n\n*Slide balance all the way to R\n\n\nNote of course it's somewhat annoying to have to turn this off / on as needed, but better than nothing.

I have the option to buy a 2009 13\" MBP for $500 - mid 2009 with the 2.53 GHz C2D. At this point, I'm leaning towards it (I'd be using it for iOS development). I know it's been well taken care of.\nHowever, before purchasing, I would like to know if there is anything particular to watch out for when buying this year of MBP. I know that the 2008 models had problems with the NVIDIA graphics.\nSo, my question: What should I watch out for when purchasing a machine like this?\n\nA: I used to work as an Apple Hardware Technician, and the biggest non-damage related issue I've seen with those machines is usually the battery (which is not technically user-replaceable). I'd make sure that it runs for at least 3-4 hours on a full charge. Also make sure that the optical drive works, because I've seen a number of those go out, as well, but that can be said for any notebook computer.\nYou will also want to check for the normal stuff: Impact to the casing, cracked screen, liquid damage, etc.\nThat seems like a pretty good deal, however. It looks like the average price on eBay is around $600, and that machine will have plenty of power for your purposes. Heck, I still do development on a 2009 Macbook and it works great.\nFor future reference, you can always find a listing of the open repair extensions (which are basically known-issues) at Apple's website.\n", "Q: Finder: keep sort-by per-directory Some directories make sense to be sorted by date modified, while others make more sense to be kept sorted alphabetically. \nHow can I make it so that finder will apply a specified sort by selection on a per-directory basis? \nIf no such feature exists (In which case I hope somebody at APPL is paying attention), I suppose using/remapping the keyboard shortcuts (Defaults being Cmd+Ctrl+5 for Modified and Cmd+Ctrl+1 for Alphabetical by Name) is the next best thing. \n\nA: Finder should already remember both arrange by and sort by modes for all normal folders. But in column view and list view the current folder is the root folder of the window. Or if you use column view, it is usually some location in the sidebar or the computer view.\nI don't think there is any way to change that, but if you open folders by selecting them from the sidebar (or for example from Alfred), you could add folders to the sidebar.\nI'd actually like the opposite and make all folders default to arranging by none and sorting by name. Deleting .DS_Store files only does that temporarily until you change the sort by or arrange by modes manually.\n\nA: You can right-click on the folder, click on \"Show View Options\", and then you can modify the \"Sort By\" default via a drop-down menu.\n\n\n", "Q: Can I download iTunes U courses to USB flash drive?

My question is - \nCan I use a thunderbolt to VGA cable to view TV on my computer? \nI assume the direct answer would be no, but may be with the help of some external software?\n\nA: The answer is still no! The graphic card inside the MacBook cannot handle video input! Only output!\nSecond: There is currently no working adapter beside \"HDMI to Thubderbolt\". No converter yet!\n\nA: No, the feature you refers to is called Target Display Mode, it's only available on some Intel iMacs with Thunderbolt or Mini Display Port.

At one moment, I need to go to the previous animation phase – which would be the shortcut Shift–Left Arrow or [ (left bracket).\nHowever, with my presenter it is only possible to go the previous slide — which would be the shortcut P, Delete, Page Up, Left Arrow, Up Arrow, or Shift–Up Arrow.\nI do not want to use a keyboard since I want to speak freely in my presentation.\nSo the questions are: Is this a problem of my remote control? In other words: Are there remote controls that as well have a \"previous animation phase\" button? Do I need to somehow trick the system to make it work?\n\nA: You can do this in Mavericks pretty easily (I just did).\nGo to System Preferences -> Keyboard -> Shortcuts, select \"App Shortcuts\" and click the + button. You'll be asked to select the app you want to create a shortcut for (Keynote, in my case), the exact text of the menu item you want to create a new shortcut for (\"Play Slideshow\" in my case), and the keyboard shortcut you want to assign (Shift-F5 in my case, which is what the Logitech R400 uses for \"start slideshow\").\n\nA: Technically, your remote simply simulates a certain key press. You will need to remap your page up (⇞) key to shift left temporarily (as long as you don’t need \"page up\" functionality — typically during your presentation). My recommendation is KeyRemap4Macbook, more info here. The app has a passthru option which you should activate if you do not want any key remapped outside of presentations.

I am wondering if Apple changed the form factor of their MacBook (Pro) batteries since Early 2008?\nI was planning to replace my broken MacBook Mid 2010 Unibody with a used MacBook Pro from early 2008. However, the battery life of my MacBook 2010 was ~4-6 hours still, where the battery of the MacBook Pro I am interested in only lasts ~2 hours.\nSo, it would be nice if I could simply swap the batteries. Unfortunately I didn't find that many infos on the battery shape and compatibility.\nWhat I read here was that the battery of the 2008 Pro has 60 Watt, and the battery of the 2010 MacBook model has 63.5 Watt.

After sending them to the trash and emptying it, next day I receive the usual email, but the previous email is also shown below the new email. The problem happens with my gmail and hotmail accounts.\nHow can I set things up so that when I delete a mail from my Gmail Inbox, it also gets deleted on the servers and other devices?\nI don't want them to be somewhere around I don't need them. Every time I receive an email from the newsletter I got a list of all the emails dating back to 3 or more months. I remember I delete them one by one and then emptying the trash but no luck next day there were all of them as part of the \"conversation\".\n\nA: There is a several hundred word long tutorial, \nFull Step-by-Step Tutorial  taken from here, that I have used to solve this problem so in addition to the author testing it, I too have things fully working.\nHere are the steps from the article as well as details from the two key steps.\nStep 1: Configure Apple Mail preferences \nStep 2: Assign mailbox functions\nStep 3: Set the [Gmail]/ prefix on custom labels\nStep 4: Designate which labels show in IMAP\nSince this is the most important step, here are the details\n\nWhile you’re in the Labels tab, uncheck the “Show in IMAP” box for All\n  Mail because you don’t want that showing up in Apple Mail anymore.\n  This is important to ensure the delete button sends messages to the\n  Trash in Mail.app. The “Show in IMAP” box will determine which labels\n  appear in Apple Mail. Feel free to uncheck the “Show in IMAP” box for\n  any other labels while you’re at it. Changes are saved automatically.\n\nStep 5: Forwarding and POP/IMAP\nThis also is a key step where google allows you to delete a message once it's removed from tha “last visible IMAP folder.” By hiding the All Mail label in IMAP, there should only be one “visible” copy of your message, so when you delete the message in Mail, it will now move the message to the Trash.\n\nStep 6: Restart Apple Mail\nStep 7: Test it out\nI've tested this on Lion 10.7.5 and works perfectly.\nAll images are from Jeff Schuette as is the quoted text explaining how google can be set up to work like all the rest of the Mail servers to delete messages when you trash them.\n\nA: Google have some documentation about how to set up Gmail in Apple Mail here: perhaps that page might help you.  They suggest going for IMAP over POP (my emphasis below):\n\nFinally, IMAP offers a more stable experience overall. Whereas POP is prone to losing messages or downloading the same messages multiple times, IMAP avoids this through two-way syncing capabilities between your mail clients and your web Gmail.\n\n\nA: Setting up Gmail on a Mac is super quick and painless in 10.7+. Just use the System Preferences > Mail, Contacts, and Calendars pane. \nFor your issue, go to Mail and from the menu bar uncheck View > Organize by Conversation\nEven though you deleted the messages the conversation view will display them below your current message from that sender even when the message is in the trash mailbox.  \nYou could also set Mail to empty the deleted items every so often in the Mail preferences under the individual account settings for Mailbox Behaviors. \n\nA: Per this KB article Deleting IMAP messages, \"If you want to delete a message from all folders, move it to the [Gmail]/Trash folder.\"  If you don't move them to the Trash folder, they will just be removed from the currently selected folder (tag) on the server, and put into All Mail (Archived).\nSo if you go into Prefereces...->Accounts->Gmail Account->Mailbox Behaviors and then check:\nMove deleted messages to the Trash mailbox\nStore deleted messages on the server \nYour messages will be moved to the Trash instead of being archived when you delete them.  Per that same article, \"If you delete a message from [Gmail]/Spam or [Gmail]/Trash, it will be deleted permanently.\"\nUpdate: Forgot the last part of this, you have to go into Settings->Forwarding and POP/IMAP in Gmail and pick what you want to happen for When I mark a message in IMAP as deleted and When a message is marked as deleted and expunged from the last visible IMAP folder\n\nA: There are two factors that are combining to dredge up the past:\n\n\n*\n\n*Apple's Mail app will try to link all messages according so several criteria.\n\n*Gmail has designed a system to prevent the majority of people from ever deleting mail messages. They do this by presenting an Inbox view that is a subset of the All Messages store and deleting a message from the inbox doesn't actually delete the message unless you take several steps in coordination to ensure a deletion actually deletes all \"copies\" of that message.\n\n\nAdditionally, OS X email queues operations for deletion and sending, so when you take action on an item (like sending it or deleting it), it gets queued for operation and can get derailed / postponed / corrupted. iOS completes the task and then plays a sound, mail plays the sound and then tries to complete the app / queuing it and optionally notifying you later if it fails to eventually get the mail server to obey your commands.\nThe simple solution to your seeing past messages might be to disable related messages so you don't ever see the old messages.\n\nHowever, this feature is useful for other reasons, so you might need to dig into the details of how gmail works to allow you to hide certain messages from IMAP (I would suggest simply hiding All Mail from IMAP or get rid of the gmail inbox entirely and that way when you delete a message it means what you want it to mean across all of your mail clients - OS X, iOS, and other clients you may care to use).\n", "Q: Can I tell who used iTunes on my iMac to sync while I was away? Is there any way to see who used iTunes from my iMac with USB connection? Actually i want to see iTunes logs when someone get connected, synchronized or used my books? \n\nA: One way to tell if a device has connected to your iTunes is to check the preferences and see if there is a device backup.  When you can connect a device to iTunes it creates a backup of the device (if you are syncing stuff to and from it).  In your case it sounds like you wanna find out if your books have been syncing to another device.\nOpen iTunes Preferences:\n\n\n*\n\n*Windows: Choose Edit > Preferences\n\n*Mac: Choose iTunes > Preferences\n\n\nThere will be no way for you to see what specifically was sycned, this will only tell you if a device has synced, and when.\n\nA: As far as I know, iTunes maintains no log file of devices that have come to sync and that pairing is stored on each device as opposed to each computer.\nFor instance, if you connect an iPod touch to iMac A and sync contacts - the iPod remembers the hidden/internal ID of that iTunes library so that it knows to sync again next time it sees that library file (and not even that Mac).\nThen if you connect the same iPod touch to another MacBook and sync music (and choose automatically sync rather than manual sync), the iPod remembers that its music came from a different library file. Again - the touch doest know the MacBook per-se but just the library file that was open in iTunes at the time it synced.\nThus way you can have one device sync different parts of its data with different users on the same computer and/or different libraries on different computers. The tracking is done on the iOS side of things and not on the computer end from what I've experienced.\nThe only edge case is if your devices are not set up to back up to iCloud in which case, iTunes may try to back up the device before starting a sync. I would start there, but it's not a guarantee that each synced device would have a backup (or even if there was a backup, it can be easily deleted).\nYou'd need some other tool to track things if you want to have a log of each sync event and/or catalog attached devices if you want to know what happens when you leave a computer unattended.

Will Apple decline an app from the App Store if a test feature is in place? I've looked over the generic App review guidelines but don't know how or where the line is drawn.\nFor an example specific to my case, we want to add a button that will redirect a user to a coming soon page on our website.  We ultimately want to see how many users are clicking on the button to gauge how much interest there is in this product/feature. \n\nA: Yes.  This has happened to me.  Apple sends your submission through a light testing regime by a human.  If they pick up an egregious bug or substantially incomplete feature, they may reject your submission.\nYou could change the verbiage on the button to make it clear the feature is not yet implemented, which would probably pass.\nOne suggestion is to have a live blog and link to discussions, using a redirect from your web server to track which button was pressed in the app.  This way, reviewers arrive at a logical page while you could track which version of the app was used. Why risk rejection for submitting something with an incomplete feature when you can have a simple \"coming soon\" link before you submit your app for review?\n", "Q: Change of IP / Configure AirPort Extreme Earlier today our IP Address changed due to misconfiguration caused by our ISP.

Some ISP assign static IP remotely so you don't have and can continue using DHCP. It's all about what they tell you to do.\nYour local computers should not need to change anything as the router translate all traffic from them to be displayed online as your static IP.\nWhen it comes to the different numbers and where they are suppose to go it should be clear in the information from the ISP.\n", "Q: How to duplicate the content of a MiniDV to a DVD? I'd like to save the content of some miniDV tapes to DVDs. I can use iMovie to do it, but iMovie creates a lot of video files and sort them by date. It will be a titan job to reorder them by hand and burn a DVD after that.\nIs there a way to ask iMovie to just create 1 giant clip with the content of a tape? or any other way to sort the clips as they stands on the tape (import order will be fine) \nOr, eventually, Is there another app that does the job?  \n\nA: There are a few ways to get a single large DV file imported from tape, depending on whether your constraint is budget or time:\n1) QuickTime Pro 7 has a recording mode that can see DV devices. Yes, Apple still charges $29.99 for it, but the interface is simple and lets you record a long, single file. Just make sure the capture format in the app's preferences is set to 'Device Native' or something along those lines (I believe it wants to transcode to MPEG-4 by default).\n2) WhackedTV was a free sample application provided by Apple to developers to demonstrate video capture frameworks. The app seems to be gone from Apple's site but a third-party mirror is available. This app lets you add a DV video/audio source, configure its capture format, and record as long as you need to. I still use this app on a regular basis.\n3) A final option is to script the standard QuickTime 7 player via AppleScript to open a video capture window, which it will allow you to do even if you haven't purchased Pro. Unfortunately, I don't have the original source code for this script, so you would have to open up AppleScript Editor and QT7's dictionary and work it out through trial and error.\nAny of these recording approaches will yield a .dv file (or a DV file in a .mov container), either of which can be taken in by iDVD, a simpler DVD app like Burn, or by Handbrake if you wish to transcode to MPEG-4/H.264.\n\nA: If your only goal is to take the video content from a mini-dvd and place it on a normal sized DVD, you can use HandBrake to do this. You will get a video file as an output, given a source disc.\nIf your goal is to re-burn onto a DVD as a playable DVD, then you may want to use DiskUtility to image the miniDVD to a DVD ISO file, then burn that DVD ISO to a blank DVD. \n", "Q: Will an AT&T iPad purchased from Best Buy US work in india?

On my 4-month old mid-2012 MacBook Pro I observe that Spotlight seems to want to ALWAYS re-index. I frequently notice that the performance will get unbearably slow and I can hear the hard drive clicking away. Then I go and click the Spotlight icon and sure enough, \"Please stand by while we index your hard drive.\" A few minutes later, it finishes and things return to normal.\nPlease be aware, I'm NOT talking about the first indexing that can take several hours (or all night). \"Just let it finish\" is not the answer. This is an issue that has plagued my computer for months. The re-indexing jobs pop up every few minutes and finish a few minutes later.\n\nI found an article where somebody is apparently having the same issue, and tried his suggestions to no avail.\nI'm at my wit's end! Spotlight is constantly saturating my I/O with its indexing and making my shiny new Mac unbearably slow.\nI am grateful for any additional ideas, including more open-ended suggestions about how to go about trouble-shooting such problems in general.

If there are a large number of files on those external drives, and the files on those external drives change frequently, Spotlight, by default, may try to index every file on every external drive whenever such a drive is attached to your Mac, and this may tie it up. If so, add those external drives to the \"Prevent Spotlight from searching these locations:\" list in the Privacy pane.\n\nA: Putting System Directory or any root level directory in the Privacy Tab is a very bad idea. These root level directories are not owned i.e. not given read-write permission to by a user account which is generally of admin type. An admin account does not have the ability to have read-write permissions to anything other than what is in a home directory.\nHere's the link:\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/ht2409\n Check the bottom- Additional information section.\nNow, about the spotlight doing reindexing for brief moments, I think its been more prevalent in Mountain Lion. I've tried reindexing the spotlight every now and then (adding and then removing Mac HD from the Privacy Tab, using commandline tool: mdutil E /, removing com.apple.spotlight.plist from ~/Library).\n  Resetting the ACL from the Recovery HD triggers an automatic reindexing. After its done, the problem still doesn't resolve. Few days after that i once again encountered the unusual behavior of spotlight.\n   But its not getting in the way of performance. It just happens every now and then.\nIts irritating. Just wait for OS X Mavericks and hope it does away with the problem.\n\nA: I had the same problem and it came out it's doing it because of SD Card.

I have a MacBook Air (11-inch, 2011) ,I am now downloading iTuneU courses 24 hours.There is only one app iTunes running,is it ok?\n\nA: Yes of course. I had my MacBook running for a week once. And as long as you don't do any heavy tasks, such as rendering or video compression, you won't have any overheating issues.\n\nA: One more thing I really want to mention. I would not recommend to use any of those MacBook body cases, such as this one for example \nBasically, the cooling of the MacBooks works through a gap below the screen where the hinges are, the aluminum body, and the keyboard. If you cover you MacBook in plastic, it will reduce the heat escape through the body. Also, I often see people with key board covers. I think this is a really stupid idea, because it prevents air circulation in the MacBook and causes the heat bottling up inside.\nHowever, I have to say that at home, even if I have my MacBook closed and connected to a external monitor, I never had any issues when it ran for a couple of days.\nAlso, what I noticed when I did heavy stuff on my MacBook, is that the vans will produce some extra noise that. You can take this as a warning signal. However, the MacBook would also turn off itself automatically, if it gets too hot, to protect itself from heat damage.\nTo keep it short: I wouldn't worry about letting your MacBook running for a week or so to just download stuff, that's just fine.\n\nA: Had a friend rarely switch off his devices when everything turns to Apple, even his Air.

The Apple price for the product is $29 while I can buy it cheap from Amazon. However, many reviews are against buying the $10 Amazon product as its inferior to that of the original Apple product. Any suggestions other than Amazon?\nI'd also like to know about the quality of \"Mini DisplayPort to DVI Adaptor\" compared to VGA. I don't know if they are also widely used in projectors. Thanks.\n\nA: I have the original one and it works just great. From my experience, ~99% of the projectors have a VGA port, some DVI. To be on the safe side, I would rather pick VGA than DVI if I'd had to choose one. I cannot say much about the non-official VGA adaptor, but I am using the original VGA adaptor for years now, and I am completely satisfied. But I also have a non-Apple Displayport to HDMI that is very reliable (Rocketfish).\nIn theory, DVI should have better quality than VGA if the beamer provides the appropriate output, though, since the former transmits the signal digitally, and VGA is analog. Principally, DVI is HDMI without sound.\nI can remember some colleagues complaining that their generic once were sometimes not recognized. But this could also have other reasons and happen with the original one. \n", "Q: Why do I get back more disk space when I restart my Macbook on Mountain Lion 10.8.3? I frequently run low on disk space on my laptop.  When I'm down to my last gig or so on my 256MB SSD (as reported by iStat Menu), I'll get various warnings from the OS and apps saying that I'm running out of space.\nI can empty my trash, which buys me a little more time, but eventually I will run out of space and won't have any more to empty in my trash.\nThe weird thing I have discovered is that if I reboot my mac, I get another 8-10 gigs of storage back for free.  After a reboot just now, iStat is now reporting 10.83GB free, and the Finder confirms it (reporting 10.96).\nWhat I don't understand is where this storage is coming from.\nAt first I thought it might be related to Spotlight indices, since I've often noticed that spotlight has to re-index after a reboot.  However, after spotlight appears to finish indexing (as reported in the spotlight menu), the available disk space is still over 10 gigs.  So it's likely not spotlight.\nThe amount of space I get back is suspiciously close to the amount of RAM I have in my machine (8 gigs).  Could it be related to virtual memory?\nMy assumption is that somehow it's related to temporary cache files, but I don't know which or why, or how to clear those caches without a reboot.\nSo my question is: Why do I get back 8 to 10 gigs of storage space after a reboot when my hard drive runs low on space?\n\nA: When the OS is low on memory it creates a file called a swap file, aka virtual memory on your hard drive, and in OS X this starts at some amount (I think 64 MB) then double as needed. So if you have 8 GB of RAM, you could end up with an 8 GB swap file. This is then deleted when you reboot.\nYou can read about it on http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paging\nWhere the files are located and how to disable it: http://osxdaily.com/2010/10/08/mac-virtual-memory-swap/\n\nA: As @pg-robban suggested, the most likely cause of this is that the system's swap space is growing until it fills the HD. To check whether this is really what's going on, run the Activity Monitor utility, select the \"System Memory\" tab at the bottom of its window, and check the \"Swap used\" statistic; if it grows as you use the computer, that's what's eating the HD space.\nIf that is the problem, the next step is to figure out what's eating all of the space. In Activity Monitor, switch the pop-up menu near the top of the window to \"All Processes\" and sort the process list by the \"Real Memory\" column. Unfortunately, this number doesn't include swap usage, but it's still a pretty good guide to which programs are using the most memory (the \"Virtual Memory\" column is not particularly useful, since it includes some categories of \"memory\" that don't take up any actual space, either in RAM or on HD).\nIt's likely that some program is leaking memory, i.e. using more and more as it runs. It may be that you can quit that particular program and reopen it and get its memory usage to go back down. Depending on what program it is, you it might be possible to figure out why it's leaking memory and fix it (unless the program is just plain buggy/badly designed).\nNote that quitting & reopening the program won't recover the HD space (at least immediately). OS X is fairly lazy about releasing swap space when it's no longer needed. But if you make a habit of quitting & reopening the program frequently so its memory usage never gets too big, the OS shouldn't have to allocate the swap space in the first place.\nBTW, you can get slightly more info about the system's swap file with the command sysctl vm.swapusage. For example, my Mac currently has 1GB of HD space allocated to swap, but it only using 470MB of it:\n$ sysctl vm.swapusage\nvm.swapusage: total = 1024.00M  used = 470.80M  free = 553.20M  (encrypted)\n\n", "Q: dual boot Mountain Lion/Mountain Lion I got a Macbook Pro with OS 10.8 installed on, the usual recovery partition that is created by the OS installer, and a 35GB partition (currently NTFS, but I can reformat in HFS+ if needed).\nMy question is : can I use the recovery partition to do a full OS 10.8 installation on the small partition, in parallel with my everyday-use installation (i.e. will it let me do that without erasing/wreaking havoc on my current OS, is there any known caveats, and so on)?\n\nA: You WILL need to reformat the smaller partition from NTFS to HFS+ before booting to the installer but otherwise it's pretty straight forward.  When you boot to the installer / recovery partition you will eventually be prompted to select the installation destination, choosing the smaller partition will tell the installer to install 10.8 on that partition rather than your main partition.\nOnce the installation is complete you can choose which one to boot into either by specifying it in System Preferences > Startup Disk or by holding option at startup and selecting the proper partition.\n", "Q: \"Home\" and \"End\" HotKeys in Vim INSERT Mode with MacBook Pro I am pretty new to Vim and to Mac, I have a MacBook Pro with Retina Display running OS X 10.8.3, which does NOT have native Home, End, PageUp and PageDown keys.\nI know the Fn + arrow keys can work in some applications.

I would like to track the battery usage of all insatalled and system applications in iOS devices.\nI hope it would look like this:\n\nIs it possible to do this, if it is possible how to estimate the battery usage by all apps?\n\nA: There is a app called Carat that might be overkill but it is way better than just watching the consumption.\nIt actually recommends what to do to save battery life.\nOne drawback is, it will not imminently show what needs to be done. \nIt will take >24 hours of monitoring your usage and then make recommendations on which apps to kill and how much battery life you get.\n\n\nA: As of iOS 8, this is built-in.\nSettings => General => Usage => Battery Usage.\nThe top section shows overall usage, the bottom section breaks it down by app.  You can see last 24 hrs or last 7 days.\n", "Q: Can't access internet Suddenly, a couple of days ago, I have started to have major problems accessing internet through my home network, with my MacBook Pro Mid 2012 (non-retina) running Mountain Lion. \nI connect to the network just fine, but when can't open web pages or when I try to ping google.com I get:\nping: cannot resolve google.com: Unknown host\n\nor something like:\nPING google.com (173.194.32.33): 56 data bytes\nRequest timeout for icmp_seq 0\n64 bytes from 173.194.32.33: icmp_seq=1 ttl=53 time=43.372 ms\nRequest timeout for icmp_seq 2\nRequest timeout for icmp_seq 3\nRequest timeout for icmp_seq 4\n64 bytes from 173.194.32.33: icmp_seq=5 ttl=53 time=45.110 ms\n\n--- google.com ping statistics ---\n6 packets transmitted, 2 packets received, 66.7% packet loss\nround-trip min/avg/max/stddev = 43.372/44.241/45.110/0.869 ms\n\nI can't find any pattern to the results.\nALL other devices on the router has no problem access neither the network or internet.

Network Diagnostics saved the day.\nFortunately, my other computers on the network were okay, so I was able to find this article!!\nI had this issue all day. Everything was fine last night. This am, after opening the laptop ( 2013 15\" retina )- I had the issue. I could connect to the network, but not get online. Tried turning off IP6 and other things ( bouncing router, etc). But running Network Diagnostics somehow fixed it for me. No idea why.

So since I'm using a weekly prepaid data plan, I need to renew the data plan again and again for every week. Hence I wanna know if I can use iMessages in order to apply my data plan again which I need to send it to '28882'.\nIs that possible to use iMessages, or if it does not allow me to do so, do you have any idea how to send text messages as if 'normal messages' to especially non-apple devices?\nAny idea what other apps do I need to use?\n\nA: Up until I did an update, I could email non Apple users without any problem. After the update, I couldn't. I spent over an hour with an Apple \"genius\" that finally fixed it. I just updated again and I have the same problem. This is ridiculous! I have customers that text me orders. I am so frustrated!!

The presets window shows the \"scaling\" option under \"Copies & Pages\" but this does not show up in the printing drop-down menu... so I'm stuck. \nDoes anyone know how to change this setting?\n\n\n\nA: Here is what I did.\nIn for example TextEdit...\nI used the Page set up!\nIn there you can adjust the scaling\nNow go to the print and check you settings in show presets, current.\n\n\nA: Your first step is to try printing to .pdf from a [virgin] User Account.\nFailing that test, I would reinstall the O.S.\n", "Q: Disable Screen sharing via the command line in mountain lion I want to be able to enable and disable screen sharing from the command line rather than through System Preferences. This is on 10.8.3\nTo enable screen sharing, I find I only need to change a dictionary value in the following plist: \n/var/db/launchd.db/com.apple.launchd/overrides.plist\nTo be precise, to enable screen sharing, I do the following:\nsudo defaults write /var/db/launchd.db/com.apple.launchd/overrides.plist com.apple.screensharing -dict Disabled -bool false\nAnd that changes:\nsudo defaults read /var/db/launchd.db/com.apple.launchd/overrides.plist com.apple.screensharing\n{\n    Disabled = 1;\n}\n\nTo:\nsudo defaults read /var/db/launchd.db/com.apple.launchd/overrides.plist com.apple.screensharing\n{\n    Disabled = 0;\n}\n\nFine. I see from this site that I need to then do this (not sure why):\nsudo launchctl load /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.screensharing.plist\nNow if I want to disable screen sharing I try the reverse:\nsudo defaults write /var/db/launchd.db/com.apple.launchd/overrides.plist com.apple.screensharing -dict Disabled -bool true\n\nI get:\nsudo defaults read /var/db/launchd.db/com.apple.launchd/overrides.plist com.apple.screensharing\n{\n    Disabled = 1;\n}\n\nWhich is good, but then I have no successful way to get launchctl, or whatever (not really sure) to re-read this plist.\nI try \nsudo launchctl load /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.screensharing.plist\nand I get:\nnothing found to load\nAnd indeed, despite the dictionary value for this screen sharing being properly set to indicate screen sharing should be off, well, I still can screen share in just fine.\nSo what is the proper way to disable screen sharing from the command line on 10.8.3?\n\nA: To start screensharing:\nsudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.screensharing.plist\n\nTo stop:\nsudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.screensharing.plist\n\nThe -w flag modifies the Disabled key as appropriate. It's best to let launchctl handle this, as the location where the config files are stored has changed a bit between OS versions.\n", "Q: Warranty on products received as a giveaway I received an ipad mini 2 months ago as a giveaway at a computer company luncheon.  It is my 4th ipad & 1st mini.  Two nights ago, I noticed the back right side (left side if looking at the back) was hot and the device was not responsive.  Charging or resetting using the dual-button process made no difference in status.  I was wondering if anyone knows if a device \"won\" new at a computer show or luncheon is still covered by warranty?\nThanks\n\nA: Your mini should be covered under warranty since they haven't been out for a full year yet, however you can double check using Apple's public facing service site - SelfSolve.Apple.com\nApple's warranty follows the device by it's serial number, not the owner, so winning it through a raffle shouldn't have any effect other than it may have been purchased weeks/months before it reached your hands.\n", "Q: Keeping my birthday private I was required to give my birthday when creating an Apple ID. How do I now keep this information private? I see it has appeared on my Google calendar and I am hoping it does not appear on my contacts' calendars as well.\n\nA: Your birthday will be private. Read the privacy policy if you're concerned about it.\nIf your birthday appears in your calendar, it's probably because your birthday has been added to your private card in Address Book. There's an option to show birthdays in Calendar. However the birthdays are only showed to you, not your contacts.\nBeware of entering an erroneous birth date. Apple can ask you your birthday to verify you're the actual owner of the Apple ID for security purpose. So if you enter a false birthday, be sure not to forget it.\n", "Q: MacBook unusable due to kernel_task I've disabled hibernation, and removed the sleep image file. I shutdown my Macbook Pro (15\" retina), unticked the box to open windows on restart, and started my MacBook again. As soon as I'd logged on I went to Activity Monitor and saw kernal_task is using 1GB of RAM.\nThis is a problem as I use parallels and when using Parallels, Parallels itself uses ~3.5GB of RAM and the kernel_task jumps up to over 2GB of RAM. So I have hardly any RAM left for the rest of the computer and it slows down to a crawl. \nThis has only been a problem since recently. Before I could run Parallels, Mail, Tweetbot, and Safari all at once (and in Parallels on Windows 7 I was using Visual Studio 2012 and/or SimCity). It was only once I ran SimCity along with the rest that it started slowing down. But now it slows down as I say above with nothing open in Windows 7 in Parallels, let alone VS2012 or SimCity.\nIs there a way to see what the heck kernel_task is doing and to cut it down?\nWill reinstalling OSX work (without wiping my hard drive first so I can keep my files)? I'd rather not do this as it takes about 24 hours to download OSX Lion on my connection.\nEDIT: It's now ridiculous I can't open Parallels at all because after a few minutes the computer runs out of RAM and I'm forced to crash it by holding down the power button. I will offer a 500+ bounty (Can't atm because of the stupid 2 day wait) if that helps.\n\nA: I know your post is from a while back, but if this is still an issue, try my suggestions in this post. If those don't work, D.W. posted some other useful links in his comments.\nHope you get this worked out :)\nVlad\n", "Q: Finder does not open Clicking on the finder icon in the dock has no effect.

I still have access to the disc, but I lost the piece of paper with the key. Can I somehow recover it? I already had a look into Keychain Access Utility, but I couldn’t find it.\n\nA: What would be the purpose of disk encryption if the key can get recovered from the encrypted disk itself? Unless you find it in the Keychain (and I'm not even sure it's there in the first place) or somewhere else where you may have written it down, you are out of luck. \n", "Q: mount an unmountable drive I have a MacBook Pro with a root mounting sector with problems.

system crash. Actually vim is quite stable and run in user-space, so it's very unlikely that it made your system crash.\nNote: By active, I do not mean front-most. For the multi-tasking to work, the kernel gives CPU time to all processes alternatively, switching fast enough to give the impression that all of the processes run “at the same time”. At the time of your crash, vim was the current process with CPU time.\n\nA: This seems to be an issue that is covered under Apple TS4088 regarding spontaneous crashes, especially on mid-2010 MBPs.

Inside it I have 5 smart playlists. one playlist for each star rating. 1 star, 2 stars...etc. is there a way for itunes to automatically write a '1' in the grouping tag when i rate a track with one star? thanks!\n\nA: Short answer: No.\nLong answer, still no, but there are workaround. You cannot have the label added in the grouping tag as soon as you rate the track. However, you can write a small Apple-Script that you would setup to run everyday (or every hour, or anything else) that would scan your iTunes library and write the tag to the tracks, depending on their rating.\n", "Q: MacBook keyboard error, only letters not working A couple of weeks ago I damaged the logicboard of my MacBook when I attempted to clean the keyboard. However, it worked perfectly fine if I had the lid closed and attached it to an external keyboard.\nBut it happened twice, that there was a triple klick sound from the MacBook internal speakers and my Bluetooth keyboard stopped working. I figured out that only a restart could fix the problem. \nNow, I got a new MacBook and transferred the system from the old one. Now it gets weird: the same strange clicking sound and the in-built keyboard stops responding. However only letters seem to be affected. Now I am wondering if it is a software issue that I carried over via the system transfer. Any ideas?\n\nA: I had some similar issues with USB keyboards attached to an iMac. I solved this issue by deleting the contents of the Library/Caches folder from my user session (the Home icon) and rebooting the Mac.\n\nA: Did you have a Logitech keyboard at one time?  If so, you might have an old Logitech kernel extension that is causing problems.  Uninstall the Logitech control panel from System Preferences and look in /System/Library/Extensions and delete LogitechHIDDevices.kext and LogitechUnifying.kext (reboot for extra certainty). Many people have had problems due to the Logitech stuff on Mountain Lion.  \nIf that's not it, your problem still could be caused by something similar.  Third-party kernel extensions are transferred during a system migration.  Likewise it could be a more run-of-the-mill extension conflict.   \n", "Q: Any danger to letting a MacBook stay on the charger long-term? I came into possession of a 2009 13\" MacBook Pro.

Will it kill the battery, or does the Macbook have a charge/discharge routine?\n\nA: Ideally you should let your computer discharge completely every month to avoid losing battery capacity.\nApple has a calendar to remind discharging the computer every month at webcal://www.apple.com/batteries/images/notebook_icalreminder.ics\n", "Q: OSX won't automatically connect to WiFi About a week ago, my OSX machine stopped connecting to any WiFi networks automatically.

And it should work transparently to the user i.e. he just run my app from the Application folder by double clicking it.

I haven't been able to connect to an FTP server from Finder, if I use other client there is no problem.\nThe username I am using to connect is in the form user@domain. The domain part in the user name is not related to the ftp server I am trying to connect to, is just that the user name contains an '@'. \nI found a similar issue where the password contains '@', in my case it is in the username.\n\nfound that any password with an '@' symbol in it caused Finder to\n  immediately display that error and not even try to send any traffic to\n  the FTP server.\n\nFor real, is Finder unable to connect to FTP servers if there are '@' in the credentials?\nHost is specified here\n\nThen credentials are specified here \n\nIt is a common and very simple use case, so it is hard to believe that Finder, the default file explorer doesn't support it.\n\nA: I personally am not surprised this is broken, but then again, I have larger faults with Finder's ftp implementation than this problem. From someone that's used to ftp on the command line, it's second nature to think of the @ as reserved to delineate the user part of the string with the host name part of the string, so perhaps that's a bug that the author of the code introduced.\nJust as you're finding it hard to believe this is broken, I find it hard to believe Apple hasn't removed ftp from finder entirely and just pointed people to the Mac App store for a ftp client of their choosing at this point. Here's to hoping they do that for 10.9.\nAssuming you are in need of a solution today, here are suggestions to work around it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Try using ftp from the command line\n\n*Try to escape the @ with \\ or otherwise trick the finder into getting past it as a delimiter\n\n*Use another program like Transmit that has more robust handling of any valid strings.\n\n*Searching the Mac App store in April 2013 yields no less than 56 choices for FTP.\n\n", "Q: Finder doesn't show thumbnail previews for RAW files Since I upgraded to Lion (10.7.5), Finder doesn't display thumbnail previews of ARW files. ARW is a Sony RAW image format (in my case files were produced by Sony NEX-5 camera). Finder used to display the thumbnails under Snow Leopard (10.6.8), but not anymore. ARW files are opened as usual by the Preview app, their previews are shown in the Finder preview column and by Quick Look. Only the thumbnails are not shown.\nI've googled and found this is a well-known issue but unfortunately there is no reliable solution. Somebody fixed it by removing Finder preferences files (~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.finder.*), somebody by installing latest versions of iPhoto and \"RAW Compatibility Update\" and somebody reported it was only fixed for him in ML 10.8.2 update.\nSo far I have:\n\n\n*\n\n*Fixed the permissions on system drive\n\n*Removed Finder preferences files and restarted the Finder\n\n*Installed updates for iPhoto (9.4.3) and RAW Compatibility Update (4.05)\n\n*Danced with a shaman's tambourine\n\n\nBut still no luck. Any thoughts? Is upgrade to Moutain Lion my only choice? And will it indeed help?\n\nA: Raw support for cameras is something that changes with almost every OS update. Specifically, Lion 10.7.0 only supports some cameras, and 10.7.1 adds more, and so on. Also, according to this KB article on what cameras Apple supports - it is similarly vague that you need specific versions of Aperture or iPhoto to even see whether your machine needs a RAW camera support update.\n\n\n*\n\n*http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4757\nSo, it looks like Apple is adding raw support to the OS in combination with you having a new enough version of either iPhoto or Aperture. I would say, you might want so jump to 10.8.3 and install the latest iPhoto from the Mac App store since my feeling is Lion intentionally changed RAW processing to exclude anything it wasn't sure it supported instead of 10.6's we'll try to draw anything and if it crashes, so be it attitude.\nHowever, if you don't want to spend $40 on this, delay the upgrade to Mountain Lion and just buy the latest iPhoto (if needed). At that point you can call Apple support since you recently purchased iPhoto (or possible recently purchased Lion) and ask AppleCare to verify your camera model is compatible with your software versions. You get 90 days of complimentary software support anytime you purchase Apple hardware or software since they want you to get up and running with your new purchase.\n\nA: I've managed to fix it. Here is the story.  \nAfter I upgraded iPhoto to 9.4.3 and restarted the Finder, it started to display ARW thumbnails. Sometimes... But sometimes black icons were shown again instead of image thumbnails and previously rendered thumbs disappeared as well.\nI manually removed the thumbnails cache (on my system it was stored in the folder\n/private/var/folders/XX/YYYYYYYY/Z/com.apple.QuickLook.thumbnailcache/) and restarted the system. It helped, but only till the next time my MacBook had gone to sleep.  \nThen I found the nice article on fixing Quick Look issues and runned the following commands:  \nqlmanage -r\nqlmanage -r cache\n\nAfter that I relaunched Finder and the issue seems to be gone now.\n", "Q: Delete Application from iPhone 5.1 Simulator Strange Moment !!!\nI was testing my iPhone App on iPhone 5.1 Simulator.

I tried several times but same Result.\nWhy this happens and what to do to solve the Problem ?\nNote :  I have tried to Reset it but Resetting the Simulator removes all the Apps from the Simulator. I am curious to find some way to remove that single App from Simulator.\n\nA: Go to the iOS simulator menu and choose Reset Content and Settings...\n\nWhy this happens is harder, but it's just development and you are working with a simulator, not a real device. Sometimes it's faster to get out the broom and clean the floor to start freshly.\nIf you are curious, the simulator filesystem is stored in the following location:\n\n~/Library/Application Support/iPhone Simulator/version\n\nSo if you want to poke around and delete things, you could try to exercise the phantom app, but I don't see you saving time by somehow editing the filesystem and hoping the simulator would work once it's broken in the manner you describe. The normal way to delete an app is to press the X and since that's broken, who knows what else is out of sync. Better to start fresh and not waste more time when the system says there is a problem with the simulator.\n", "Q: Mac Notes Keeps Opening Up every 5 seconds Yesterday, I decided to set up iMessage on my Macbook Pro.  And ever since then, Mac Notes keeps opening up every 5 seconds.  I close it, or force quit, and it opens again in 5 seconds.

It's as though it wants to create a new note each time.\nMacbook Pro\nMountain Lion OSX 10.8.3\n\nA: If you previously had Twonky Media Server installed and removed it, that could be the culprit. I had the same issue, though with Lotus Notes (also conveniently called Notes.app), starting/popping up every 5 seconds.\nCleanTwonkyServerData.command (in /Users/Shared) was the culprit, it might be the same for you.\n\nA: On the off chance it's useful, I'll share my experience with Reminders, which did something similar to me. It wouldn't quit, and I couldn't even shut down the machine because it would pop right back up again. I finally tracked down the problem -- I had GeekTool displaying Reminders on the desktop. The script kept reopening the app to check in at its specified interval, I guess.\nRather a long shot that that's your problem here, I realize, but just in case it helps. \n\nA: Search twonky \"on this mac\" you will see a file named cleantwonkyserver or something to that effect..

Apps that I initially installed, such as Adobe apps, MS Office, Firefox, etc., all require an admin password to install updates.  In order to avoid the snide comments from users about their lack of admin rights I'm looking for a way to allow users to update certain apps without requiring an admin password.\nIs there a way to do this without giving the user full admin rights?  Giving admin rights to the actual application might be one way, but some apps install components in other restricted locations.\n\nA: We do this by using a management framework that basically has a sudo functionality that's controlled and logged centrally. If you don't want to create your own management framework, look for something like JAMF Software's Casper suite or an open-source framework like munki to manage patches and application installs. I don't know if munki handles the admin/standard user issue, but it's a place to start if you have no budget but can spend time learning if a tool might help you.\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.jamfsoftware.com/products/casper-suite/macosx/patch-management/\nThe Casper self-service portal idea allows normal users to pick from items that you have allowed self-updating and self-patching without needing any user on the receiving end of the patch/update to be an admin user.\n", "Q: Should I use Automator or another program for repetitious tasks?

I am not sure how else to explain what I am trying to do, but I just need some way to make the program that I am using automate the saving task for each image. P.S I don't know if it helps but the program that I am using is called (Texture Packer)\n\nA: It looks like the TexturePacker program includes the ability to process images from the command-line, which you could then batch process with a script. You'll first want to install the utility by clicking Install Command Line Tool under the TexturePacker menu in the app.\nThen I'd suggest having a look at the documentation, which includes the command-line parameters for most of the options in the app. Have a look at that, and see if you can get  the actions you need on the command-line.

I think my girlfriend is using facetime to talk to an ex-boyfriend so that it does not register as a call on our joint phone bill. (Or I'm the one worried about my secret relationships being spied upon and don't want to have someone knowing with whom and when I'm communicating to others by reading a phone bill).\nCan someone explain if iOS can be set up to force and/or eliminate the possibility that something being sent as an iMessage would cross over into being sent as an SMS message?\n\nA: iMessage will use sms/text messaging if the data link to the Apple servers are non-functional. You can configure the phone to send as text by default. \nNote that all text messages on the phone are stored in a sqlite3 database file, so if you are concerned and want to access that information, performing an unencrypted backup of the phone will give you a copy of the sqlite3 database file. Though you would need to isolate it from the thousands of other files, all identified with a hash filename. Not that hard, actually.\nThe other option would be to jailbreak the phone and cd into the app folder for iMessage and access the messages database. \nIn either case, in answer to your original question, if access to the iMessage servers at Apple are inaccessible, then the phone will default to sms/text messaging. \nNote, if someone wants to communicate secretly, there are plenty of apps for that. Plenty of Visual/Audio chat programs out there that completely bypasses the phone log systems.\nIf they are using FaceTime, then there is no need to use sms/text. Ie, the communication is all happening through the Apple servers.\nIf they delete it from their logs, then, depending on whether the log entry was purged or just flagged as not displayed, the entry may be recoverable. However, chances are, it's not recoverable. \nIF your intention is to find out/keep track of someone's communication, then the only real practical way is to gain additional access to their phone. Ie, jailbreak and then installation of additional code.\nOne way to say retain the call logs, be they via sms/text or imessage, or factime, would be to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Have a script or program continually locate the sqlite3 database for the iMessage app as well as the sqlite3 database for the Addressbook. The location changes in the event of iMessage being updated. Or an OS update.\n\n*Periodically backup the sqlite3 database and the addressbook database.\n\n*Have those copied to your private server somewhere.\n\n*Perform SQL queries against the databases to correlate which imessage goes with which addressbook entry, then generate a report based on the timestamps and correlated information.\n\n\nIf you want to do this without Jailbreaking the phone, you can write and publish an iOS app, which requests and accesses the Addressbook and the iMessage interfaces to achieve the same thing. \n\nA: Sometimes an iMessage goes through as a text message when you have limited Internet service or when the other person does. By this i mean either there's no service where either of you are or 1 bar that keeps dropping out. \nSometimes it also occurs when the other person blocks you. If you message them but you have been blocked, the messages will come through to them as text, not as an iMessage. \n", "Q: Problems setting up gmail on ipad On my IPad I use a GMail app for my email.\nHowever some applications seem to require sending via the built in Email client.\nThat's question #1 - why doesn't for example my camera app allow me to send pictures via gmail?\nAnd question #2 is - the IPad default email client is not allowing me to create a new GMail account with my Gmail configuration in settings.\nI  am doing the following in Settings:\n\n\n*\n\n*Mail, Contacts, Calendars\n\n*Gmail\n\n*Enter my Name, email address, Google password and description\nIt gives me a dialog that says \"The user name or password for \"imap.gmail.com\" is incorrect.\n\n\nWhy?

There are slight work arounds, so if you try to attach within an app it uses that app, but in all other cases by default it will always use Mail.\nIn regards to your Gmail not working, try referring to this article to add your Gmail account to mail.  There are some things that have changed recently with Gmail on iOS devices.  It's not longer setup through exchange so it might not work as effectively as you would if you used the Gmail App.  Your mail will not be pushed automatically you will have manually open the Mail app and refresh to receive new mail.

What is the procedure to do so?\n\nA: The following assume your MySQL 5.1 is installed in /usr/local/mysql-5.1.46-osx10.6-x86_64 and that MySQL 5.6 will install in /usr/local/mysql-5.6.11-osx10.7-x86_64. The exact directory names might differ depending on the exact version number you are using.\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the MySQL 5.6 installer, for instance in DMG format, and run mysql-5.6.11-osx10.7-x86_64.pkg\n\n*Stop the server\n\n*\n\n*With MySQL Workbench, go to Server Administration\n\n*open mysql@localhost (add connection if not there)\n\n*under Startup / Shupdown, click Stop Server\n\n\n*Create backup of 5.6 data directory: sudo mv /usr/local/mysql-5.6.11-osx10.7-x86_64/data /usr/local/mysql-5.6.11-osx10.7-x86_64/data.save\n\n*Copy data directory from 5.1:  sudo cp -a /usr/local/mysql-5.1.46-osx10.6-x86_64/data /usr/local/mysql-5.6.11-osx10.7-x86_64/\n\n*Start server (similar to stopping, see above)\n\n*Run mysql_upgrade, which checks all the tables and upgrades system tables\n\n*Check data there, with MySQL Workbench\n\n*\n\n*In Server Administration, under Users and Privileges, check the expected users are present\n\n*In SQL Development, open a connection to the database, and run a few queries to check the expected data is present.\n\n\n*In MySQL Workbench, if getting \"Error deleting password entry error when connecting with MySQL Workbench\", upgrade to the latest version of MySQL Workbench\n\n\nA: This worked for me. Almost same scenario. MySQL 5.1 to 5.6 only I run into a problem upgrading one of my databases table (the biggest one), did not dump correctly and was rejected during upload to new server, took forever and timed out several times, so I had to do something out of the books. (Before you do download your database, do a complete backup, repair, check and all the maintenance required so you dont have messed up data in your new upload. Also, do a direct wire transfer, dont use wireless with large databases.\n1 - All my tables, except the biggest one, uploaded without a problem (regular export then regular import thru phpmyadmin from 5.1 to 5.6 MySQL different servers side by side with my laptop in the middle)\n2 - I went into the MySQL source data directory (depends on your system but on Centos 7 is in /var/lib/mysql/) and search the table with the problem, it has 3 files named after the table (table_name.MYD, table_name.MYI and table_name.FRM) you need to download those 3 manually thru FTP like Filezilla or copy into a USB)\n3 - Just in case, create a target blank temp_database and give all the rights to a user. MySQL creates an additional directory called temp_database where you are to copy those 3 files for that table. (dont need to mess with good upgraded tables, if you need to do upload all the tables, you can proceed to copy all the tables files into that new temp directory, is faster when you do copy directly without using MySQL)\n4 - Once you transfer the table files into that new target temp directory, then you will be able to see them on phpmyadmin (on the new server) as temp_database, check the table, make sure all data and records are there correctly, displayed and accounted for.\n5 - Since we created a copy thru FTP or a USB plain copy, then obviously the file is READ ONLY, and performing a check or repair table it will tell you so. You need to do CHMOD thru shell on those files so MySQL can process the repair. I guess, while repairing the file, it does the repair and upgrade of table format or any other version problems.\n6 - After you are happy with the table, and you can insert, update and delete one record as test, then you can just move that table or tables onto the right database using phpmyadmin to make everything work as usual. Remove that temp database and you are set.\nI have only performed that in your same scenario, 5.1 to 5.6 upgrade.

After countless searches, I haven't managed to find any clear answer on the subject.\nThe iMac 27\" (late 2012) features a tray on the back of the computer, which you can open after pushing a button located behind the power cable, in order to add or remove memory modules.\nWe are intending to house a large number of iMac available to a large number of people, we'd rather not get the RAM stolen in the process.\nI have an untested theory that the Kensington slot featured on the iMac might lock the button if there is a Kensington lock in place.\nAny truth to it or should I be looking into something else?\n\nA: I just saw this yesterday on cultofmac.com which basically answered all my problems \"Maclocks.com comes up with the only solution to fully protect your new iMac\" http://www.cultofmac.com/235129/maclocks-lock-for-imac-prevents-your-ram-from-being-stolen-for-just-50/\nHere is the link to the product page itself http://www.maclocks.com/imac-locks/imac-security-cable-lock.html \nThanks for bringing awareness to this issue and thanks to maclocks for solving it!\n\nA: I don't have a Kensington lock to test with, but based on my examination of the RAM slots on my late-2012 iMac, and some Googling, I don't think the lock slot in any way prevents opening the RAM bay. I think you're going to have to come up with some other measure to prevent access.\n", "Q: (find: *.png: No such file or directory) terminal I am trying to do some batch processing in terminal with texturePacker. The creator of texturePacker said that this is the way that you batch convert a directory of .pngs to .pvr.ccz.\nfind <directoryname> -name \\*.png | sed 's/\\.png//g' | \\\n    xargs -I % -n 1 TexturePacker %.png \\\n        --sheet %.pvr.ccz \\\n        --data dummy.plist \\\n        --algorithm Basic \\\n        --allow-free-size \\\n        --no-trim \\\n        --opt RGBA4444 \\\n        --dither-fs\n\nBut I keep getting this output in the terminal.\n(find: *.png: No such file or directory)\nDoes anyone know why it would be saying that?\n\nA: Did you specify the name of the directory containing the files: where the placeholder <directoryname> is? Is there at least one file ending in .png in that directory?\nTry with the first part of the command:\nfind <directoryname> -name \\*.png\n\nto see if you get the list of files.\n\nA: It's likely you're not inputting the directory properly. The command you enter in should be something like: find /Users/me/mydir/ -name \\*.png […], with no angled brackets, and if you have any spaces in the directory path, be sure to put it in quotes, like so: '/Users/me/my directory/'.\nIt's also worth noting that the command will act on any PNGs not just within the directory you give it, but also any subdirectories.\nAn alternate (and slightly more concise) version that just acts on the current directory would be:\nfor f in *.png; do TexturePacker \"$f\" --sheet ${f%.*}.pvr.ccz --data dummy.plist --algorithm Basic --allow-free-size --no-trim --opt RGBA4444 --dither-fs; done\n\nNavigate to whatever directory you want in Terminal (easiest way is to type cd, drag the folder onto the Terminal window and hit enter), then run that command.\n", "Q: Installed new SSD, but I have no Snow Leopard disk. Can I install Lion from Internet? I've just installed a 128GB SSD onto my 2009 MacBook Pro. I've run into an issue.\nI was under the impression you can install Lion over the Internet on a fresh install. I've done this before on a family members MacBook. I can't replicate it though. I have purchased a copy of Lion, and I installed it on the old drive.\nI do not have a copy of Snow Leopard as I gave it away by mistake when I sold my iMac. Gave the guy the wrong disk.\nI no longer have the old HDD contents, and the only other computer I have in the house to download anything to is a computer without an optic disk drive - a Macbook Air.\nWhat are my options for installing OSX on the MBP with the new SSD?\nI am sure I was able to install Lion over the web on my stepdads MacBook on a fresh install as he has no Snow Leopard installation disk.\nAny advice is much appreciated. At the moment I am seeing a folder with a question mark at boot, which I understand is usual behaviour as there is no OS.\n\nA: Lion / Mountain Lion's recovery is only present on hard drives that have the system already installed.  Internet Recovery (likely what was used with your Dad's Mac) is only built in to newer systems that shipped with Lion or Mountain Lion. Apple support page documenting this\nIn your situation I think your best bet would be to download Mountain Lion using your MacBook Air, build a Mountain Lion installer disk using the application below, boot to the install disk/drive by holding option while powering on your Mac and selecting the disk and installing as usual from there.\nLion Disk Maker\nHope that helps!\n", "Q: Hiding URL Bar on iPad? I am working on a small web app that runs on controlled iPad (i.e., both the hardware and content is in our office and never leaves).  I would like to hide the URL bar in this app.  I've placed the following tag at the top of each page:\n<meta name=\"apple-mobile-web-app-capable\" content=\"yes\" />\n\nOnce \"installed\" to the iPad's home screen the first page looks as I expect it. However, the first click opens a new page in Mobile Safari and the URL bar returns.\nIs there a way I can keep the fullscreen \"web app\" feel at all times?\n\nA: I attack this problem by distributing the web app as a configuration profile. Rather than having people tap the mobile Safari button to add the app to the home screen, you have them download the profile file OTA from the web server.\nThey will need to approve the profile installation, but then you can control the icon and force the full screen attribute so that your users don't see Mobile Safari's chrome.\nIf your web content is getting opened in Mobile Safari (like the web content here, you may need to try playing with all links within the app to be relative to the site or program things to exist in an offline database rather than being full URL that cause the fullscreen safari to think it needs to open a linked page in the normal Mobile Safari view). \nI also use this article on developing for iPad - perhaps you need to set the viewport and have a few other items to ensure that the touch interface is used to navigate rather than opening a new URL.\n\n\n*\n\n*Technical Note TN2262: Preparing Your Web Content for iPad \n\n*Configuring Web Applications \n\nA: I had the exact same trouble, though using the window.navigator.standalone attribute, code fixes it all.\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n$(document).ready(function(){\n        // iOS web app full screen hacks.\n        if(window.navigator.standalone == true) {\n                // make all link remain in web app mode.\n                $('a').click(function() {\n                        window.location = $(this).attr('href');\n            return false;\n                });\n        }\n});\n</script>\n\n", "Q: Activating the Apple Thunderbolt Display speakers when Macbook Pro is docked Sometimes, I don't get access to the Display Audio that my Thunderbolt Apple Display provides when I dock to the machine with my MacBook Pro.  The clunky way to solve this, is a reboot.  I've tried using the Apple Preferences (Sound), but that fails to provide the option, unless I reboot.  Here is what my system_profiler shows as available Sound/Devices after the reboot (and when the Apple Preferences does give me the option to select the bigger Thunderbolt display):\nDevices:\n\n    Built-in Input:\n\n      Input Channels: 2\n      Manufacturer: Apple Inc.\n      Current SampleRate: 44100\n      Transport: Built-in\n\n    Built-in Output:\n\n      Default System Output Device: Yes\n      Manufacturer: Apple Inc.\n      Output Channels: 2\n      Current SampleRate: 44100\n      Transport: Built-in\n\n    Display Audio:\n\n      Default Input Device: Yes\n      Default Output Device: Yes\n      Input Channels: 1\n      Manufacturer: Apple Inc.\n      Output Channels: 2\n      Current SampleRate: 44100\n      Transport: USB\n\nAny ideas how to 'wake-up' the Thunderbolt connection to recognize the third item (Display Audio) without resorting to a reboot? Ideally, that would at least activate it as an option in the Apple Preferences menu.\nHere's a picture of the Preferences:\n\n\nA: I've experienced this annoyance too. Rebooting can be very inconvenient when I have a lot of work open. Unplug/plugging the monitor doesn't seem to help. After reading the answer above, I started to log out, canceled it and for some reason the display audio option was restored. Woohoo! I'll repeat same procedure next time and see if this was just luck. \n\nA: Since the USB connection to the speakers is tunneled over the Thunderbolt cable to the Mac, you might need to hot plug that (disconnect and reconnect).\nI would be curious if logging out of your user and logging back in restores the sound destination. If so, it's likely a software issue on Apple's OS X side. If not, then it's likely a firmware issue or hardware issue on the display side.\nSorry I can't be more specific, but that's how I'd try and corner the actual root cause/culprit.\n", "Q: Keyboard shortcut within Mission Control for choosing a specific application window? I use Mountain Lion and want to know if there are keyboard shortcuts for moving around and choosing a particular application window within a given active desktop in Mission Control.\nI chose an option to show all active windows separately in Mission Control.\nCan anyone help?\n\nA: If you REALLY use Mission Control a lot there IS a workaround that must be configured individually:\n[EDIT:] I wrote an \"elaborate\" Karabiner Elements script (json); it's linked at the bottom of this post.\nThe very commendable 3rd party software \"Karabiner Elements\" (interim version) allows to simulate mouse movements in a \"general\" way, meaning: no exact positioning to screen coordinates, but just movements to left/right/bottom/top (or combinations of these).\nMoreover its \"mouse moves\" depend on your System-Preferences' mouse velocity settings.\nBut still, if you invest a little time for finding ideal values for your own mouse, you'll be rewarded by a shortcut \"script\" that allows to (e.g.:) move between visible apps' windows through arrow-key-directing.\nA typical code particle looks like this:\n{\"mouse_key\": {\"x\": 3072} which moves a mouse cursor \"fast\" to right, \"y\" values moving up/down (\"3072\" = max. value; depending on your mouse settings one click would \"call\" this code several times).\nHere arrow keys move cursor, return/enter take a selected window back to your space.\nAn over-simplified \"script\" would look like this:\n{\"title\": \"Mission control, navigation\",\n \"rules\":[\n            {\"description\": \"Mission control, navigation\",\n             \"manipulators\": [\n                   { \"from\": { \"key_code\": \"right_arrow\"},\n                       \"to\": [ {\"mouse_key\": {\"x\": 3072}} ],\n                     \"type\": \"basic\" },\n                   { \"from\": { \"key_code\": \"left_arrow\"},\n                       \"to\": [ {\"mouse_key\": {\"x\": -3072}} ],\n                     \"type\": \"basic\" },\n                   { \"from\": { \"key_code\": \"down_arrow\"},\n                       \"to\": [ {\"mouse_key\": {\"y\": 3072}} ],\n                     \"type\": \"basic\" },\n                   { \"from\": { \"key_code\": \"up_arrow\"},\n                       \"to\": [ {\"mouse_key\": {\"y\": -3072}} ],\n                     \"type\": \"basic\" },\n                   { \"from\": { \"key_code\": \"return_or_enter\"},\n                       \"to\": [ {\"pointing_button\": \"button1\"} ],\n                     \"type\": \"basic\"     } ]\n}        ]  }\n\nAs mentioned: this code lacks essential ingredients, is even dangerous:\nE.g., in every app you use a \"return\" or \"enter\" would be replaced by a mouse click!\nSo firstly: it is NOT restricted to the \"Mission Control\" view; reason is: there is no actual app to aim at! … MC's \"frontmost_application\" is the top one in \"normal\" view, e.g. Finder or Safari.\nThis MUST be handled by calling \"mandatory\" modifiers (I recommend/use: Control & Shift).\nNext: above, you have to keep arrow keys pressed while the cursor \"rolls\" across your screen.\nThis is improved by making \"multiple\" (= farther) \"jumps\" in one key press AND preventing key repetitions.\nAbout 4 to 8 \"moves\" (= times \"arrow\" pressed) to get from one end of your screen to the other seems practical to me; the return key will select an app's window and \"go back\".\nI installed a much more elaborated code version on my MacBook-Air – and it works quite nicely.\nMaybe, if somebody's interested, I'll post a json file here, once I optimised  all facets of it …\nHere is my code for a \"realistic\" mouse jump behaviour:\nhttps://gist.github.com/clemsam/ef03ed5127fd9783267b60065c70fc17\n", "Q: Where do I go for help when purchasing an iOS developer program and the payment is refused? I am trying to buy paid membership for one year to the iOS developer program, but I could not complete the activation step.\nI have a gold visa credit card and I tried to use it to buy the program.\nWell, I put my credit card number in the purchase form. But there is only a credit card number field. There is not any security code field in the form.\nMy credit card number has 16 digit and the security code has 3 digit.\nI have received an email from Apple asking me to send a fax because my credit card number is not complete.\nWell, Is it necessary to inform the security code? How can I inform my credit card information in the purchase form?\n\nA: This is a little confusing since you start with Apple's developer page to create a free developer account, which then places the appropriate item in the normal Apple online store. I'm also a bit confused, since you don't get to the activation step until you've paid for your program - so no money changes hands during the activation (or even renewal) on the developer site.\nFor billing and/or payment support, you should call the phone number for the Apple Store you are using (in the US, it's 1-800-MY-APPLE) to work out whatever payment issues you have. I wouldn'tbother calling Developer Support at this point, since you need to buy the item just as if you were buying an iPod or a Mac from the online store where you live. If you have a web order number, I still would call the main store and have them check the status of the order and refer you to developer only once they've made sure the payment is OK. They are best suited to assist you with the purchase / credit card / security code issues and the developer side only needs to see that you have paid and doesn't care if you paid with Credit Card, a loan, an Apple Store Gift Card or any other means of payment that Apple accepts.\nOnce you \"buy\" the program from the normal store, a second redemption code is emailed to you whereby you then have to log back in to developer.apple.com to complete the enrollment process by agreeing again to any documentation requirements they may have once they have reviewed the documents you submitted.\nIf you applied as a business, there will be a several day delay while you collect the documents you need and submit them. Normally they get sorted within a working day or two. Again, if you need to get a hold of the development team, the main Apple sales contact can know what phone number you should call based on which storefront you are using to purchase your paid developer program.\n", "Q: Applications (Google Drive, Dropbox, Eclipse, etc) only start when I launch them from within their package I am running Mountain Lion and I have an issue when trying to start certain applications: Dropbox, Google Drive and Eclipse.\nIf I click their icon inside the Applications Folder or I try to launch them from Spotlight, they will not start.  As simple as that, they just will not start, no sign of anything, nothing.\nHowever, I found out that I can still launch them if I do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Suppose I would like to launch Google Drive, then I will go to the Applications folder in Finder.\n\n*Right click the icon of Google Drive and select the option 'Show Package Contents'\n\n*Go inside the Contents folder (only folder that appears when I perform step 2).\n\n*Go inside the MacOS folder.\n\n*Double - click the unix executable file that has the name of the application I want to run, i.e. Google Drive\nAfter this, a Terminal window is launch and the application starts and keeps running as long as this windows is open.\nMy questions are: how could I start my application in the easy usual way (click on its icon)? Has anybody experience the same issue? Did you find a solution?\nThank you very much!\n\nA: It is possible that this could be a hardware problem? Specifically the logic board.  I discovered mine needs replacing. I am having the same errors. I also discovered that launching the Unix Executable works for many of the apps that otherwise won't load.  This makes no sense to me, but after hearing two Apple Support Technicians confirm, who am I to question.\n", "Q: iPhone calendar error edit?usp=drive_web when opening attachment When I attempt to open a file attached to an appointment in Calendar on my iPhone it has replaced the file name with and error, \"edit?usp=drive_web\" and the application crashes when the attachment is clicked.

Or, can I only stream from devices to computers? Seems quite limited, if so.\n\nA: If you want to watch Netflix on your Mac, the best way to go is just use Netflix.com (you'll need the Silverlight plugin).\nAppleTV doesn't have any capabilities to send streams (ala AirPlay), just receive them from other devices. The reason for this is effectively that the Apple TV doesn't really hold any content. It sources it all from other places, all of which can be accessed from your Mac (i.e. iTunes, Netflix, Hulu, etc.).\n\nA: In your favorite browser, go to the Netflix Watch Instantly page, sign in, and enjoy. \nIts just that simple!\n", "Q: Can a file be copied to one hard drive in a RAID 1 mirror set (software RAID), and later have the 2 drives sync up? I think I read that we can set up a RAID 1 mirror set (software RAID) using OS X Mountain Lion using Disk Utilities, and later plug in one drive and copy a file to that drive, and later on, plug both drives in, and the two drives will sync up automatically?\nBut I just set that up (using 2 brand new drives), and then Eject the RAID set, and now unplug both drives, and plug only one back in, and the drive won't show in Finder, until I use Disk Utilities to examine the drives, then the drive will show up in Finder.  And then I copied one file to the drive, and plug in the other drive.  And then this second drive blinked for 10 seconds, and I thought they sync'ed up.\nHowever, when I Eject both drives and then plug back the second drive alone and invoke Disk Utilities and look at the drives and then go to Finder to see the files, that new file is not there.  And if I plug both drives in and restart the machine, and invoke Disk Utilities, the 2nd drive show up as \"Failed\", and the RAID set show up as \"Degraded\".\nSo is there a way to copy files only to 1 drive and let them sync up later?  Sometimes, my Macbook Air may have only 1 open USB port, so I can't plug both drives in.  (when I don't have any USB hub).\n(I later on tried using \"Rebuild\" in Disk Utilities, but it took a few minutes and was rebuilding the drive and later on reported that the remaining time is 4 hours.  The first drive only have 5GB or content, and the 2nd drive only has 3.5GB -- only 1 file which is 1.5 GB is missing).\n\nA: You're thinking of RAID-1 in the wrong way. RAID-1 is not an architecture intended to happily use a single surviving drive within a raid-1 group, and work out mirroring content later. Ultimately it will do that, but that is considered a recovery operation from a failed state, and it will destructively overwrite the mirror drive after replacement. In RAID-1, the two drives are expected to be both online and available all the time, as transactions will be committed to both. A loss of one drive will not stop the system from operating, but that is considered a failure mode, and as you've seen it will operate in a degraded state. \nThe expected user operation at that point is to replace the failed drive, at which point the RAID software will make a block-for-block copy from the surviving drive onto the new drive, a process sometimes referred to as resilvering. It doesn't look at files within the filesystem. This can be a resource intensive process, and as you note, can take hours. This is expected behavior.\nIf you want something that will enforce eventual consistency in drive contents, use something like Rsync. There's an app to help set it up. http://arrsync.sourceforge.net\n", "Q: Do not show refit menu on boot (only with option key) Is it possible to configure rEFIt so that the menu does not automatically show on my macbook when booting? I would like it to boot straight to OSX and only show the menu when I hold the option key, similar to how it worked before I installed rEFIt.\nI am using:\nMBP 10.6.8, rEFIt 0.14\n\nA: I suppose the smallest timeout possible (1 sec) would be a kind of solution, although not exactly what you wanted.\nIf you have another OS installed on the internal HDD that can be booted by the stock Mac bootloader, you could install refit to the corresponding partition and bless the OS X partition. Thus, when you need refit/ind, you hold the alt key during boot and select the partition where it's installed.\n\nA: Go to System Preferences => Startup Disk and then select the disk you want to boot on.\nIt'll start on this disk every time, if you want to load refit, then press alt and refit will appears\n", "Q: Swap Mouse Button using AppleScript I use mouse with left-hand.

So far no problem, and the benefit of having extra ones is I can keep one at work, keep one at home without having to (remember to) unplug it, and also have one I carry with me incase I need to project somewhere.\n", "Q: Input Method Keys not Firing Event I have recently purchased an external Japanese keyboard from FILCO.\nIn addition to the regular keys, it also has 3 keys specifically designated to switch between Western and Japanese character input.\nApple provides the same keys on its Japanese keyboards and they function as expected.\nWith a 3rd party keyboard however, these keys don't fire at all.\nEven when viewed with tools like KeyRemap4MacBook's event viewer, key-presses are not detected as events.\nIs this a common issue?\nMy written Japanese is weak, so my searches in Japanese didn't turn up any results.\nAny direct advice or even links to articles in Japanese (or English ones I might have missed) would be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: Maybe it's not recognized as a JIS keyboard. See http://m10lmac.blogspot.com/2009/12/fixing-keyboard-type-problems.html:\n\nSometimes a machine will forget which type keyboard is attached, with the result that certain keys get transposed from what the user expects. The fix for this is run the Keyboard Setup Assistant again. Sometimes there is a button for \"Change Keyboard Type\" visible in System Preferences/Keyboard. If not, you can try trashing the file\n/Library/Preferences/com.apple.keyboardtype.plist \nAnother possibility may be to open Terminal and type:\nsudo open /System/Library/CoreServices/KeyboardSetupAssistant.app/Contents/MacOS/KeyboardSetupAssistant\nSometimes, when JIS is involved on a laptop, one may have to follow the procedures in the PMU Resetting instructions. \n\nIf nothing else works, you can use KeyRemap4MacBook to map other keys to かな and 英数 keys:\n<autogen>__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::F1, KeyCode::JIS_KANA</autogen>\n<autogen>__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::F2, KeyCode::JIS_EISUU</autogen>\n\n\nA: A Japanese friend just helped me solve it.\nThis page contains detailed instructions:\nhttp://atsuo60.blog24.fc2.com/blog-entry-285.html\nThis is the tools used to enable all keys:\nhttp://chulip.org/entry/20100206/1265461109\n", "Q: itunes error(-1) coming when restoring iPhone 4? I made a custom iOS 6.1.3 ipsw using sn0wbreeze to prevent the baseband update, then stitched my 6.1.3 sHsH blobs to it using redsn0w. Then I went to itunes and put my iPhone 4 in pwned DFU mode and used shift+restore to restore to the above mentioned ipsw. The restore started, apple logo showed up on the phone, then the snowflake with the progress bar. Then abruptly itunes gave the error (-1) and the restore stopped. What do I do to correct it? Thanks.\n\nA: Turns out, the .ipsw I was using was not the right one. I tried using iOS 5.1.1 .ipsw with stiched blobs and restored my phone, and it worked like a charm. So if anyone finds this in the future, do not try to upgrade to iOS 6.1.3 because:\n1: The sHsH blobs for iOS 6.1.1, 6.1.2 and 6.1.3 are corrupted on the cydia server.\n2: If you update to 6.1.3 without preserving baseband, you will lose your unlock.\n\n", "Q: How can I edit translated video on a Mac? There is a movie on my Macbook which has some some inappropriate scenes that I want to edit so I can watch the movie with my family. \nI know how to cut scenes (trim) using Quicktime but this will confuse the translation timing on the film (.srt file)\nI am wondering how to make the scene freeze (fixed) while the unwanted scene is playing or better, a program that would adjust the timing of the subtitles to match scenes cut so that we didn't have to fast forward through whatever the \"censored\" still frames look like?\n\nA: I use SubMerge to load and sync subtitles to movies. I generally look for subtitles in SRT format. You can usually edit the subtitles texts inserting (or removing), pauses or blanks. A difficult part is that it's not uncommon for subtitles to slowly get out of sync with the film as the latter progresses. Adding - or removing text is really handy to restore synchronization. It is a bit of a laborious process though :)\nOnce I have the stuff in sync, then I too use Handbrake to change formats if necessary. Hope this helps.\n\nA: Firstly you have to find a Video File of Movies or T.V Shows.\nSearch Your Subtitle on the Internet in any language if you don't find it in our Subtitle list.\nDownload the .srt file of Video Subtitle in your Computer or Smartphone.\nUpload that SRT File here by Clicking Upload Button.\nSelect your preferred language in which you want to Translate SRT File.\nNow Click On Upload+Translate Option.\nIt takes a few seconds to get your file ready so waits.\nNow Download your Subtitles SRT File and Enjoy your Video.\n", "Q: Is there a software that can visually highlight focused windows more? I do web development on my Mac and I tend to have lots of windows open. Even per application, I tend to have multiple windows opened (ie a Terminal window for tail -f error logs, one for ssh, and one for local commands).\nWhen I switch applications with ⌘tab, the visual effect on focused window is subtle and I often get confused and perform commands on the wrong window. For example, I switch to Terminal and do ⌘w to close a tab on the tail -f command, but I accidentally closed the ssh tab!\nIs there a Mac program that will highlight or do some more effects on a focused window when I switch applications?\n\nA: If you're willing to invest some to set it up, Hammerspoon has the hs.window.highlight module that provides:\n\n\n*\n\n*Darken the non-active app (like HazeOver)\n\n*Put a border around the active app (like Honer)\n\n*Toggle one window to be isolated (like Isolator)\n\n*Briefly flash a window when it is created\n\n\nYou can further configure this to activate only for some apps. The module is written in lua so I'm guessing you can extend or replace its functionality in the Hammerspoon config file (which is Lua code). For example this config implements a red border around the focused window. There's also a function to turn off window shadows but I haven't gotten it to work.\nHaving tried Hammerspoon, Honer, and HazeOver, I like Hammerspoon's configurability but I like HazeOver for being well polished, stable, and easy to use. I had tried Honer for a while and liked the way it looked but it wasn't stable on my system. Both Honer and Hammerspoon's border-drawing will lag behind window moves, and sometimes won't catch the window move at all. I haven't tried Isolator.\n\nA: HazeOver works very well for me (in 10.10.5 as of this writing), and plays well with f.lux.  HazeOver can be changed (quickly) to highlight the active window and dim everything else (even pretty much hide it entirely, for \"focus\" or \"theater\" mode), or to highlight all windows of the frontmost app, and dim the rest just a little, which I use a lot when writing or developing.  Honer can be run at the same time, though I find its responsiveness too slow for my tastes, and it gets confused a lot, especially by float-on-top dialogs).\n\nA: If a paid app is ok, HazeOver darkens everything but the active window slightly. http://hazeover.com\nNote that I haven't used it, so I can't speak to it. It has a 4 star review, but the only review for the latest version is negative.\n\nA: This is Mavericks specific, but Honer will draw a border around the active window. You might also want to combine it with this app that removes window shadows.\n\nA: A free alternative is to keep an eye on the colorful corner buttons, they grey out when inactive.\n\nOtherwise... Haven't used it yet, but HazeOver seems the best option.\n\nA: Isolator is free and pretty good.\n", "Q: iPhone and Mac \"Mail\" app emails sync not working...? I just bought a brand new Macbook Pro 15\" and I already have an iPhone 4. I'm using Hotmail (now called Outlook) for email management. Since I'm using a Macbook now, I want to use Mail.app to manage my emails since I have multiple email accounts.\nHere's my problem :\nI have set my Hotmail account in Mail, and everything's working well. But When I read the email (of the same email account) on my iPhone, it's still mark as unread on my Macbook Pro after reading it on my iPhone.\nBut if I go on hotmail.com and log in my account, if I read a new email on my iphone that appears as unread in Hotmail, it will change as \"read\" in hotmail. So looks like the emails are synced.\nI've made some research and looks like IMAP emails accounts can do what I need. Hotmail seems to be a POP3 mail server.\nBut if when logged in hotmail website, it works with my iPhone, why can't it work using the Mac Mail app? Some website seems to be saying that you can't do what I need with Hotmail (only Gmails, and other IMAP mail server)...and some say it'S possible.\nThanks a lot!\n(I'm on Macbook Pro 2012, OSX 10.8)\n\nA: iPhone uses the 'modern' Exchange ActiveSync (which is a mobile-only protocol) to sync with Hotmail, which explains why read emails are synced to Hotmail.com.\nThe only other protocol Hotmail/Outlook.com supports is POP. Unfortunately they do not support IMAP, so POP is as good as you're going to get.\n", "Q: Have Mountain Lion Messages running but hidden from dock? I use Mountain Lion (10.8.3) Messages exclusively to monitor text messages sent to my cell phone. When I first start my computer or login Messages is hidden (I don't want it in my dock) and if I receive a text message I get a banner alert from notification center. If I open the message I enter the Messages application and the running application shows up in my dock. \nWhat I would like to do is have Messages behave as it does when I first start the computer (receiving notifications but not visible in the dock as running) all of the time (I assume it's running in the background somehow). \nIf I click 'Hide' on the Messages icon in the doc it remains visible, and if I quit messages entirely after reading a message I stop receiving notifications.\nI have tried editing its Info.plist to include\n<key>LSUIElement</key>\n<string>1</string>\n\nas suggested in the Hide a running app from dock thread, but the behavior remains the same.\nThanks! \n\nA: 10.8 is a bit more strict than previous versions, with respect to what should be a boolean value.  If you change as below, it should work like you want.\n<key>LSUIElement</key>\n<true/>\n\nNote that in this mode, not only is an app hidden from the dock, but the menu bar does not display either when the program is active.\n", "Q: Use a bluetooth headset JUST as a microphone? This is hopefully a pretty simple question. Is it possible to configure a bluetooth headset to act as only a microhphone? I am using OSX Mountain Lion. I would assume the process would be something like:\n\n\n*\n\n*Pair the headset with OSX\n\n*Set audio input to be the device instead of line in\n\n*Set audio output to be the normal audio output, and not the bluetooth headset\n\n\nIf there are any known issues or headsets I should stay away from, I would appreciate a heads up as well. We have a new HTPC, a mac mini connected to our TV via HDMI for video/audio, and we were hoping to install Rosetta Stone for the family to use in the living room. Wireless is a must for the microphone!\n\nA: You may be able to configure a bluetooth headset only as a microphone, but Rosetta Stone would refuse to recognize that microphone. a USB or an analog microphone is a must. It will NOT accept a bluetooth microphone but will accept the speaker part of the bluetooth headset. I tried to get the microphone to work with Rosetta Stone but no go. Here's the link as proof:\nhttp://support.rosettastone.com/articles/en_US/Text/Will-my-headset-work-with-Rosetta-Stone/?q=Text&l=en_US\n\nA: You can pair your headset with Os X and just use the microphone. Tested it with my Sennheiser MM400 - though I am not sure if the mic keeps the connection with the mac. When I switched from the input to the output preference pane the mic was „deactivated“. The headset stays paired but it will not send any data. But maybe your application will hold up the connection. I do not have the Rosetta Stone app for testing. \n", "Q: Configure Software Update to use a SOCKS5 proxy I've got a machine that doesn't have a direct connection to the internet.  I use a socks proxy to connect to the internet:\n% ssh -ND 8080 gateway-machine\n\nAnd I've got Firefox, etc configured to use this proxy, so I can browse the internet as normal.\nHow can I configure Software Update to use this proxy (or some other method) so I can get updates to this machine?\nI know I can set the software update url to a non-default value, so that might help, but I'm not sure how.\n\nA: Unlike Firefox, most OS X apps don't have their own proxy settings but instead respect the system-wide configuration in the Network preference pane. This is particularly true of the bundled apps like Software Update and Safari.\nTo do that, just open the Network pane in System Preferences, select the connection you want to configure on the left (e.g. Wi-Fi), then click Advanced... on the lower-right:\n\nNow, click the Proxies tab. Check the \"SOCKS Proxy\" checkbox, and then enter the address, port, and authentication info for your proxy.\n\nFinally, click OK to exit the Advanced modal, then click Apply.\nThese screenshots are from 10.8 (Mountain Lion), but it's almost the same on older versions of OS X. Which reminds me, what version of Mac OS X are you using? A Google search turned up a couple posts about Software Update not working with authenticated proxies in 10.4 and/or 10.6.\n\nA: You can bypass that and use 'sshuttle' to redirect all TCP traffic through an SSH tunnel proxy:\nhttps://github.com/apenwarr/sshuttle\nWhen you use this, it will setup an SSH tunnel/SOCKS5 proxy to another host. It will also setup local firewall and routing rules so that ALL TCP traffic will route through the SOCKS proxy/tunnel transparently.\n", "Q: Scroll button on Logitech mouse won't left/right \"click\" I just got a Mac and couldn't stand the Mighty Mouse it came with, so I got a nice little Logitech wireless USB mouse (Model M325).\nIt's much nicer, but when I have Finder in column views and go to back up or go forward directories with the middle mouse button (tilting the scroll button  left and right until it clicks), it doesn't work.\nI'd understand if Apple just didn't support 3rd party mice, but I have another (much older) USB mouse (Logitech RX 650), and it works as expected out of the box...\nAny ideas? Seems like the new Logitech mouse should work fine. Am I missing something?\n\nA: Apple offers basic mouse support out of the box for just about any USB or Bluetooth mouse. However, the center button's right/left clicks are not considered standard mouse functionality. Therefore in order to utilize these buttons, a driver or special piece of software is required. Unfortunately Logitech does not provide any special software compatible with both the Mac and the mouse model you have. This support thread on Logitech's site includes a comment from a Logitech employee confirming this.\nI have seen reports that Better Touch Tool supports certain Logitech models, to fill in the gaps that Logitech left in designing this mouse. It's worth a download, as it's free.\n\nA: Here is my reply from the Logitech Support Forum\n\nI have SteerMouse, a utility to utilize/alter the mouse features on a Mac, which I used with one (or more) previous mouses I have had.  SteerMouse can be tried for free, but costs $20 for permanent use.  But SteerMouse cannot see the M325 if the Logitech driver is resident.\nSo here is what worked for me:  First, I install LCC as usual, then I configure my Logitech wireless keyboard with it, and make sure the M325 moves the pointer (if not use Logitech Unifying Software to get it going).  Then I uninstall Logitech with the LCC Uninstaller.  Restart.  Now the keyboard is still configured as I want, but SteerMouse can see and configure the M325.\nThe drawback is that I will have to go through the install/iuninstall step if I ever want to re-configure the keyboard.  Or if I ever add some other Logitech device to configure.\n\n\nA: One work around is to go to Preferences->Mission Control and there set mouse actions for Expose (Mission Control), Show Application Windows or Show Desktop or Dashboard.\nNote that in your mouse left tilt is Mouse Button 4 and right tilt is Mouse Button 5.\n", "Q: Finder window, Save As prompt missing sidebar entries Check out this screenshot:\n\nWhy is everything missing in the sidebar?

This is the Save As dialog in Chrome, but it's the same way in a regular Finder window. I'm in OS X Mountain Lion.\n\nA: You probably accidentally hid the favourites list.

When Automator sees a new photo is runs a \"Print Images\" action, but the action doesn't have an option to change the paper size, so it prints at the default US Letter. It seems this could easily be accomplished by setting the default paper size to 4 x 6 in the Print & Scan options, but that doesn't seem to be a choice:  \nIs there any way to add custom options to this list? Of course another way to accomplish this would be fine, too.\n\nA: If you print from the command line with lp you can do something like:\nlp -o media=Custom.4x6in filename\nThat will print at 6x4 on the default printer the file called filename.\nOn my HP inkjet that made it pick the photo tray over the main tray.\nSo, put the above in a script and have automator run it pointing at the directory with the files in.\n", "Q: How to share a very large voice memo to Dropbox from iPod?

I have Dropbox on my iPod but when I try to \"share\" the voice memo, Dropbox is not an option. I don't have a computer to sync my iPod either. \nWhat can I do to get this turned in?\n\nA: Since you only have two sharing options in Voice Memos (Email, Message), you are obviously limited to those two things (clearly excluding a computer which you don't have access to). \nCaveat: the following steps worked for me, but I didn't have a super-large voice memo to test it with.\n\n\n*\n\n*Turn off \"Send as SMS\" in Settings.app -> Messages (if enabled).\n\n*Open Voice Memos.app and select the memo you want to share.\n\n*Tap \"Share\", and select \"Message\".\n\n*Type in a bogus number.\n\n*\n\n*This shouldn't be hard because we just limited our playing field to only iMessage users by turning off SMS alternate.

I have a 2tb Seagate External Drive with 3 partitions: all three were set up the same way with different passwords as a person who used to live here was burning DVD's from my digital backups I felt the need to do so. I was having no issues with this for the first six months I had the drive set up like this but about two months ago this changed. I can no longer mount one of the partitions. It will not accept the password I KNOW goes to it. All I can figure is that, some how, the system encryption key must have been damaged. The only other pieces of Info I can give you is this. First, I didn't use firevault for this but Disk Utl. Second, at times, I can mount one of the other drives and even though I get the \"shaking window\" as though I typed in the wrong pw it still mounts the drive. Odd.\n\nA: Same problem here. Read and on and I'll tell you what I did to solve this problem:\nI do Time Machine to an encrypted external Hard Disk. I stored the password to the disk in the default Keychain, and the system mounted the disk automatically after plugging it in. But suddenly, last morning, after I plugged in the disk, it prompted me for a password (it never did, since it was set to remember the password).

So I've got this new 13\" MacBook Pro Retina... a beautiful machine by all accounts! Here's the thing though: It doesn't sit flat. As in, if you put it down on a flat surface, all four of the rubber feet on the bottom won't touch the surface. Only three will (just like a wobbly, uneven table). It's not really a big deal except:\n\n\n*\n\n*When I rest my palms on the palm rest areas to type, the Mac wobbles and makes a tapping noise, and...\n\n*I'm worried that if the casing is bent or just not straight that it's putting stress on something internal or that it's an indication of poor build quality and there might be other problems.\nAm I insane? Should I just shut up and enjoy this beautiful Mac? Or is this a valid concern?\nP.S. I assure you, I'm testing this on a truly flat surface.\n\nA: If a unibody Mac is wobbly, I'd have it serviced sooner rather than later. The tolerances inside are crazy tight in some cases, so a warp could cause subsequent damage to sensitive and costly parts. A trained technician can tell at a glance if the damage was external or due to manufacturing issues.\nNow, that being said, I've seen dozens of Macs where people reported they were off and most were the table it sat upon, and not a bend in the unibody frame of the Mac. You can test by measuring how many sheets of printer paper fit under the leg(s) that has(have) a gap.  \nThen rotate the Mac 1/3 of a turn and repeat the measurement. Then take it to a second flat surface and do the measurement one last time if you're not convinced that it's the frame instead of the surface that is off-level.\nAny wobble that's less than three sheets of paper is probably nothing to worry about, but what if you needed a logic board repair 10 months down the road and today, your Mac is bent out of tolerance and you were denied warranty coverage since you didn't report the bend until then? Only by getting it checked will you know if yours was out of tolerance and have a service record to point to in case of a warranty repair question later. \n\nA: Check the Battery!\nLate answer, but could be really important to someone: I was recently given a MacBook Air whose base (and top plate) were severely \"distended\" (that's the best word I could use to describe it).\nUpon opening the case, it turned out that the battery has gone bad and swollen up like a wood tick on a hunting dog in August:\n\nI'm personally surprised (and grateful) that the battery hadn't started leaking or exploded.  \nThe good news is that it was easy to find a replacement battery on Amazon, and it took about 10 minutes to replace.  \nMost astonishingly, the case returned to its sleek flat self after replacing the battery, and the MacBook Air now works perfectly.\n\nA: Are you sure your table/desk is actually flat ? Did you test it on several surfaces ?\nIf yes, then I'd go to the Apple Store and had it replaced. This is a premium machine and it should be of good factor. I bet the genius will exchange it or have another one commanded for you if you don't have a standard configuration.\n\nA: Assuming that the surface you're placing it on is flat then, yes, this is definitely a problem. All four feet should touch the surface and no part of the body should.\nI noticed a similar problem with my a Retina 15\" after using it a couple of days and exchanged it immediately. The Apple Store employee agreed that this was not right and that maybe it was damaged during shipping.\nIn addition to this problem, when pressing the bottom of the Macbook under the left palm-rest I could feel the aluminum push in and pop back out slightly. This was also a defect (the Apple employee agreed). Both problems were probably related.\nI haven't had any problems with the replacement. They probably would have replaced it anyway, but I made sure to do the exchange within the initial 14-day return period to make sure there would be no question that this would be an exchange and not a repair.\n\nA: I recently replaced the pads on my laptop and this happened to me, if you are willing to. Take off the pads off of the bottom of the laptop, You'll see that each pad has 2 circles one large in the centre and a smaller one beside in, the smaller one is to keep the pad from rotating, One of these pads probably doesn't have the second hole aligned. and therefore is offsetting that corner of the laptop by 2 mm or so. Causing that tapping noise. Just be careful when taking off the pads, you can always replace the glue but the pads are $10 a piece from apple. \n\nA: I wonder if you got a macbook retina case,(http://www.mymacbookcase.com/142-macbook-pro-retina-case-13)  if the snapping would snap into the right place\nand give the bottom of your laptiop a new surface to rely on and in the end giving it the proper flat botom\n", "Q: Controlling File Permissions on a Windows File Share I'm using a Mac running Mountain Lion (10.8.3) with file sharing enabled to Windows users.\nWhenever a Windows user copies a file into the share on the Mac (Windows file sharing), the permissions of the file are 600, meaning that other users of the Mac cannot access the file.\nFiles copied from Mac clients (using AFP) have 644 permissions, which is perfect.\nIs there a way to configure the permissions that are set by Apple's Windows file sharing?\nIncidentally, I never had this problem previously with Snow-Leopard.\n\nA: This is probably related to the \"safe save\" feature of SMB shares in OS X.\nTo allow group access enter in Terminal:\nsudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/com.apple.smb.server AclsEnabled -bool YES\n\nSource: OS X Server: When saving files on SMB shares, the permissions might be changed so that only the owner can read or write\nThen modify/add an ACLs for the shared folder:\nchmod +a \"everyone allow list,search,readattr,writeattr,readextattr,writeextattr,readsecurity,file_inherit,directory_inherit\" <Shared_Folder>\n\nand if additional permissions are necessary for a group\nchmod +a \"<group_name> allow list,search,readattr,writeattr,readextattr,writeextattr,readsecurity,file_inherit,directory_inherit,<additional_permissions>\" <Shared_Folder>\n\nand reboot - I don't know if it's sufficient to simply restart File Sharing in the Server.app.\nThe ACLs also have to be applied to all already existing subsequent items in the shared folder to make them accessible for network users.\n", "Q: \"No connected camera\" error using MacBook Air I have a friend with a 13\" MacBook Air. He upgraded to the new software in the App Store about a week ago and now, when he is using anything that uses his built-in camera, it says \"There is no connected camera.\" I've tried looking through his settings and nothing is working to fix the problem. I've found a number of problems, but nothing has worked. We're not sure how to go about solving the problem, even after finding several solutions to no avail. \nAnything helps, thanks!\n\nA: Probably there is some process holding the camera. A dirty hack to solve this issue is to kill the culprit with:\nsudo killall VDCAssistant\n\n\nA: I had this problem occasionally too on the same model. A temporary solution was to do a SMC reset and a PRAM reset. You can find the instructions here, or below.\nThe reason why sudo killall VDCAssistant didn't work for me was that the camera had disappeared completely from the system. It didn't show up in System Report under camera.\nA while ago I noticed uneven backlighting on my MBA and had the display changed under warranty. It seems that this fixed the camera problem also, so you may want to take your MBA for a checkup to AppleCare.\nSMC RESET\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down the computer.\n\n*Plug in the MagSafe power adapter to a power source, connecting it to the Mac if its not already connected.\n\n*On the built-in keyboard, press the (left side) Shift-Control-Option keys and the power button at the same time.\n\n*Release all the keys and the power button at the same time.\n\n*Press the power button to turn on the computer. \n\n\nPRAM RESET\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down the computer.\n\n*Locate the following keys on the keyboard: Command, Option, P, and R.

In my case, it was the Kaspersky Anti-Virus thing. If you go to your anti-virus app > Preferences > Privacy > Stop blocking webcam… it should work. The reason this happen is because blocking the camera protects you from hackers hacking into your camera.\nHope this helps!\n", "Q: CRT TV as second monitor I want to play some 8-bit style games - via an emulator or as web games in a browser. I find that these look much better on a CRT TV. I thought of using a TV as a second monitor for my iMac (24\" early 2008). It seems I need an \"Apple Mini-DVI to RCA adapter\" to do this.\nI've tried using second monitors before but not such a lo-res TV screen. Will I be able to set a resolution and send apps/windows to this screen successfully? What is the performance/response time like? I know that plugging composite devices like Wii into digital displays can be laggy due to conversion.\n\nA: That adapter will work fine. I have used the regular DVI → Composite/S-Video adapter (M9267G) many times on many different Macs.\nContrary to what has been mentioned in the comments, it is not an active adapter; it requires no external power, and PAL/NTSC resolution can be output from the iMac's graphics card. It behaves exactly as any other second screen would behave, just at rather low resolution. Performance/response time will not be an issue; there is no lag. \nRegarding resolution you'll get the option to run at native 720×576 / 640×480 (depending on whether it's a PAL or NTSC TV) or a bunch of other higher resolutions, up to 1024×768 (as far as I recall). Note that these higher resolutions will be scaled to the TV's native resolution, so don't expect to be able to read 10pt text in the 1024×768 setting.\nYou'll also get a fun option called \"overscan\" which switches between scaling the image on the display so you can see a black edge around it (like a CRT computer monitor) or so the image \"overscans\" and runs off the edge of the display (like a CRT TV picture).\nThere is a thread on mac-forums.com: the first screenshot shows the resolution options you'll see.\n", "Q: iOS camera tap to focus animation Is the iOS Camera app's \"tap to focus\" animation available somewhere that I can download and use? Preferably an array of images?\n\nA: I know of none that are worth downloading.\nYou could easily record it yourself using AirPlay mirroring on the iOS device and a screen recording program like Reflector and Screeny if you have access to a machine that runs OS X.\n", "Q: How should I use VPN on a Mac to prevent compromise before the VPN starts? As most experienced users will have heard, using a Mac in a public untrusted Wi-Fi can be potentially harmful. A tool like Firesheep1 has made it very easy to intercept unencrypted communication.\nUsing a full tunnel VPN to encrypt all communication is as often mentioned as a magical solution to eavesdropping, but of course it's not that easy:\n\n\n*\n\n*Depending on the protocol and configuration of the VPN connection, the connection may drop easier. (e.g. TLS vs UDP)\n\n*The VPN connection is not established instantly when you connect to a public network.\n\n\nI think that the last two points matter a lot because whenever your network settings change the various applications immediately talk to their servers - I assume it's configd that informs them, right?\n\ni.e. Before the VPN tunnel is established, most (running) processes that require\n  internet will communicate.\n\nI see two components to being a good VPN user:\n\n\n*\n\n*Making sure things don't get sent in the clear before it's established.\n\n*Making sure things don't get sent in the clear later if the VPN fails.\n\n\nHow can I use VPN on a Mac in a public network to restrict unencrypted traffic before the VPN starts up?\n\nA: Here is an approach totally outside of the MacOS X GUI.\nHence this approach of the problem won't interfere with any network\nor VPN setting.\nLet's say I want to use an IPSEC VPN (based on the use of 500/udp == isakmp & 50/ip == esp).\nCreate an ipfw configuration file just allowing the required protocols to build the VPN:\n/usr/bin/sudo cat <<____eof >/etc/ipfw.vpn.rules\n# VPN trafic contention\n#\n# DHCP\nadd 00100 permit udp from any to any src-port bootpc dst-port bootps\n# DNS\nadd 01000 permit udp from me to any dst-port domain\nadd 01010 permit udp from any to me dst-port domain\n# isakmp\nadd 01050 permit udp from me to any dst-port isakmp\nadd 01060 permit udp from any to me dst-port isakmp\n# esp\nadd 01100 permit esp from me to any\nadd 01110 permit esp from any to me\n# all other ip go to the central black hole\nadd 20000 deny ip from any to any\n____eof\n\nCheck that its syntax is OK:\n/usr/bin/sudo /sbin/ipfw -n /etc/ipfw.vpn.rules\n\nInstall it in the kernel:\n/usr/bin/sudo /sbin/ipfw /etc/ipfw.vpn.rules\n\nCheck that your OS can reboot, and get its IP address through the\nusual DHCP. Check that most of the IP protocols are blocked:\nping www.google.com\n\nOf course, if you want to use a VPN on top of SSL, you will have to\nadapt this configuration file (isakmp + esp → https).\n\nA: Let's set aside any solution where you bring a second piece of networking gear to the problem. Let's also let the problem of stopping traffic after the VPN fails to this related, but different question.\nI look at this problem as a user centric solution and not something that's easily accomplished by modifying the OS X behavior.\nSet up two accounts on your Mac (neither need be admin accounts, but if either is, you won't need a third account to change system settings).\n\n\n*\n\n*A shell account that exists to run nothing and only establish the VPN connection.\n\n*A main account that will run the programs you wish to ensure only get access to the network once it has been properly secured with a VPN.\n\n\nSo, with fast user switching enabled, you can log out of the main account. This ensures that no programs or processes from that user will continue running in the background. Most OS X apps are well behaved, and suspend network access when they don't have an active window on-screen, but you'd have to monitor and test this forever to be sure nothing is happening - logging out is simpler to maintain.\nNow, you could also replace \"account\" above with OS and run a virtualization system like Fusion (or Parallels or any other) and only start the guest OS once the host OS has secured everything on a VPN. Depending on the VM software you choose, you also may have control over the network and can turn on and off access even when the guest OS (or OSes) are running. This is basically simulating the extra hardware I initially said I wouldn't consider.\nI hope this shows one way you could be more secure while traveling and using a network that you don't trust while minimizing the risk that this will always entail. If someone else owns the network - they own DNS, can log packets, can try man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks as well as inspect all of your packets deeply to try to determine what is flowing inside the VPN tunnel.\n", "Q: How legit is this website in telling if the phone is sim unlocked How legit is this website. It says my phone is not sim locked but I'm to scared to update it and ruin the jailbreak unlock.\nSomebody said they could factory unlock my phone for free so I gave them my IMEI number now this website says its unlock. Previously my phone was unlocked via ultraSn0w. \nNow I want to restore my iPhone and not use ultraSn0w to unlock it.\nhttp://iunlocker.net/check_imei.php\n\nA: You'll probably get what you pay for, although some sites have a vested interest in choosing one answer over another. A site selling unlock services would benefit from more SIM showing as locked. A site that sells services fixing updated phones that broke (or a site run by a cell carrier with the intent to re-lock as many devices as it can) might benefit from more SIM showing as safely unlocked.\n", "Q: outlook.com (Exchange ActiveSync) on OS X Mountain Lion Outlook.com offers email/contacts/calendar similar to Google. With my iPhone and iPad (iOS 6.1.3) I can connect to outlook.com by setting up an Exchange account. It uses the Exchange ActiveSync protocol. On OS X Mountain Lion I can choose an Exchange server in the Mail, Contacts & Calendar settings tab, but it does not connect when I put in my outlook.com login.\nIs there a way to connect to outlook.com via Exchange ActiveSync to access email, contacts and calendar?\n\nA: Unlike iOS, the Mail app in OS X does not currently support Exchange ActiveSync. \nExchange ActiveSync is different from the standard Exchange format. A mail client that supports Exchange may not support EAS.\n", "Q: Intriguing connection issue on OS X I've been recently having this issue with my internet connection on my MacBook Pro Early 2011 running OS X 10.8.3: from time to time the connection \"freezes\" for about 5 seconds and then comes back. \nIt happens both over Wi-Fi or over Ethernet cable, and it only happens to my machine when it's running OS X (it won't happen when running Windows 7 on the same machine, or on any other machine/device).

place.\nI would kindly appreciate ideas on how to approach this issue.\n\nA: Could you first check that you are really using the network interface\nyou should:\nifconfig -a\n\nCould you look at the output of the following commands (if en0 is the\nnetwork interface name of your Ethernet card):\nnetstat -I en0\n\nTo help locate the problem could you make a specific Location with just\nyour Ethernet card activated and if possible only using either IPv4\nor IPv6 but not both:\n\nCould you run the following extract of potential hardware or driver errors:\ngrep ' en[012]' /var/log/kernel.log\n\n(don't be frightened you may find a lot of Wi-Fi channels information).\nThe following message exhibited by your netstat:\n44620 embryonic connections dropped\n\nmeans you are actually the target of a silly tcp syn flooding (which\nis a denial of service (DOS) attack).\nWhen your:\nping 192.168.1.1\n\nchokes for 6s, could you run:\nnetstat -m\n\n\nA: I've had this problem for a long time now (beginning after an upgrade to Mavericks) and, after months of research, I think I finally found a fix.\nFirst of all, there are quite a number of people with the very same problem in the Apple forums:\n\n\n*\n\n*Why in OS X Mavericks internet is so slow?\n\n*Mavericks network issue\nSo this is a known issue and I really don't know why Apple has not yet provided a fix for this. In the threads listed above, there are many suggestions to fix this, but most of those did not work. Some fix the problem temporarily:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disconnect and reconnect the network\n\n*The old friend: reboot\n\n*Remove the folder containing the network config: sudo rm -rf /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration\nAfter these measures, the network connection feels much better and I do not experience drops for several hours or sometimes even days. But the problems always come back.\nThis question and the hints that the problem might be related to ARP brought me to start further research and I found this page, which describes the bug in detail and also contains a patch, which I cite here:\nsudo su\ntouch /etc/sysctl.conf\necho net.link.ether.inet.arp_unicast_lim=0 >> /etc/sysctl.conf\nchown root:wheel /etc/sysctl.conf\nchmod 0644 /etc/sysctl.conf\n\nPlease refer to the provided link for an in-depth explanation of the fix, which is supposed to be included in a future OS update for Yosemite by Apple. It disables unicast ARP requests, which cause confusion with some network equipment like your home router.\nAfter applying the fix and rebooting, it should be checked if\nsudo sysctl -a | grep net.link.ether.inet.arp_unicast_lim\n\nreturns net.link.ether.inet.arp_unicast_lim: 0. If the number is not equal to zero, the fix was not applied correctly.\nAfterwards, I found another thread at the apple communities that contains the same solution: Mavericks and Failed ARP causing network drops! Well, after you know what the problem is, finding the correct solution is a lot easier.\n\nA: First, I see dropbox running in your menu bar; have you disabled that, yet?\nSecond, try removing any other startup/login items. Look in:\nLogin:\n\n\n*\n\n*~/Library/LaunchAgents/\n\n*~/Library/LaunchDaemons/\n\n*System Preferences > Users & Groups > Login Items\n\n\nStartup:\n\n\n*\n\n*/Library/LaunchAgents/\n\n*/Library/LaunchDaemons/\n\n*/Library/StartupItems/\n\n*/Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginitems.plist (rarely exists)\n\n\nA: There is a great deal of information here on the troubleshooting and diagnostic end of things, but sometimes when troubleshooting it's fun to return to basics and question some assumptions.\nAs I mentioned in a comment, this looks very much like a QOS router kicking in due to your machine temporarily exceeding some bandwidth or packet rate cap.\nWhat if you are doing different patterns, volumes and amounts of network traffic while on OS X as opposed to Windows and that's the real cause, not the hardware drivers or the software?\nI would expect running OS X is correlated with your observations, but what if it's not the cause of the temporary network pauses.\nHave you tried researching what if any QOS filters and routing changes are implemented by your network provider? Have you considered tunneling all traffic to another computer (ssh or VPN) so that you can rule out trivial filters. (If the provider is doing deep packet inspection, or destination and true rate limiting - you may not be able to escape these short timeouts.)\nI hope there's an answer you can find by looking at the details of the network (and we'll all learn something from exploring those options) - but be sure you also consider that your measurement tools and added traffic to ping / poke at things could be affecting the traffic counts and making it more likely Skype will drop for you. The routers I set up are programmed to drop ICMP traffic before all other traffic since when capacity gets tight - I'd rather the ping fail and other packets get through. Your ISP and network provider might have set things up similarly.\n\nA: In addition to all the stuff here, you might want to make sure Auto Proxy Discovery is not on (as well as Automatic Proxy Configuration). That tends to cause more problems than not and it's often not needed.\n\n\nA: With all the great diagnostic information in this question you have narrowed down the possibilities greatly.  \nTo begin with, your pings to 192.168.1.1 greatly isolate the problem to either your router, computer, or LAN.  This is not a problem with DNS or your ISP.\nI'm most disturbed by the results of your ping tests to 192.168.1.1.   Did you do something weird in setting them up?\nFor example, you have successful pings with ICMP sequence numbers of 24267, 24268, and 24269, then 3 timeouts, then success again with ICMP 24273.  So the numbers of the successes seem right. However, the numbers of the timeouts are completely different.  I'd expect to see request timeouts from ICMP 24270, 24271, and 24272 but instead the timeouts report ICMP 89806, 89807, and 89808.  I've never seen that before and so to me it suggests you have a broken network stack on that computer.  Perhaps one too many extensions.  Any chance you have Netgear Genie installed?  Or maybe VPN software?  \nIn any case, I'd say it's time to start disabling \"enhancements\" to see if you can find a culprit installed on the computer. \nEdit\nOK, mystery solved.  The ICMP sequence number is a 16 bit field.  Treated as an unsigned integer, that means it has a maximum value of 65,535 and then wraps around to zero.  So if the local ping program is maintaining a 32 bit integer counter (which it probably would by default), it could report a 32 bit integer number for missing packets.  However, when reading replies, the reply will necessarily only have the last 16 bits of the counter.  So the reply to sequence number 89805 will be 89505 & 0xFFFF which is 24269.\n\nA: I know this is an old topic.\nBut thanks everyone for this troubleshooting.\nAll the steps helped me troubleshoot an issue where I was able to ping hosts but not connect to them via telnet.\nThe solution was rather simple (afterwards) removed all the unnecessary stuff from here (as zac mentioned)\nLogin:\n~/Library/LaunchAgents/\n~/Library/LaunchDaemons/\nSystem Preferences > Users & Groups > Login Items\nStartup:\n/Library/LaunchAgents/\n/Library/LaunchDaemons/\n/Library/StartupItems/\n/Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginitems.plist (rarely exists)\nAgain, thanks all\n\nA: When your connections starts timing out, can you do arp -an in Terminal.app and see if you still have all MAC addresses in the ARP table? as in - your router's MAC address, or the host you're trying to ping? \nIf you do (and you have the time before it starts working again), can you flush the arp table (sudo arp -ad) and then see if your router's MAC address shows up in the ARP table again? \nAlso, try running a ping to your router's LAN IP address in one Terminal session, and maybe a ping to your router's WAN IP address in another while you're on Skype. See if all of them start timing out or just one of them. One more tool that I find useful is mtr - you may need to get the source and compile it yourself or use fink / macports or other package manager. When you get it, just run it to a destination somewhere on the Internet and it will show you which hop stops responding.\nHow to install software from sources (such as mtr) Requires Xcode to be installed:\n\n\n*\n\n*download the source archive (typically .tar.gz or .tar.bz2)\n\n*uncompress the downloaded file (e.g. in Terminal.app run gzip -dc filename.tar.gz | tar -xvf -, which will typically create a new directory in the current directory, and put the content of the archive in there)\n\n*navigate to the obtained folder in terminal\n\n*run ./configure --prefix=/usr/local (please note, I like to install software from source into /usr/local to keep it away from binaries installed as part of the system; the --prefix=/usr/local option to configure will do just that)\n\n*run make\n\n*run sudo make install\n\n*done!\n\n\nA: Curious problem considering it persists of ethernet. I had a similar issue but found WiFi interference from other networks to be the problem. Switching to a 5GHz band fixed my problem, which is guess is worth a shot.\n\nA: Any hints from /var/log/system.log? \nhow does netstat -s look?\nMy hunch says delete /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration and add back the network interfaces manually. \nIt looks like you tried many things already though. \n\nA: Look similar to this?\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/5483424?tstart=0\nI just posted this for Mavericks.  Thoughts?\n\nA: Mac OSX Hints  http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20080605143917233\n  on dropped connections because DNS lookups fail pending DCHP identification \n  of a router .. \ntry configuring your Mac to use the OpenDNS (OpenDNS.ORG) servers \ninstead of your ISPs DNS servers. \n\nIt is most likely the DNS and/or a acceleration setting in your modem settings and bypassing that DNS should help resolve your issue. \n\nA: This smells like another device on your network is trying to use the same IP as you, or some trouble with DHCP.\nCould you see if you can still reproduce it after assigning yourself a static IP?\nGoto Network Preferences, choose your Ethernet interface, advanced, TCP/IP\nChange the \"Configure IPv4\" dropdown to \"Manually\"\nIPv4 Address: 192.168.1.150 (something unique, not what DHCP had assigned you before)\nSubnet Mask: 255.255.255.0\nRouter: 192.168.1.1\nSave\nThen try to reproduce the issue again.  When doing this test, make sure your Wi-Fi is off so only your Ethernet is in use.  This will help narrow it down.\n\nIf you're still having the issue, you should download Wireshark (http://www.wireshark.org/) start a capture, reproduce the issue, save the dump and let us take a look.\nAlso, what Router/AP are you using?\n\nA: Two things to check that correlate to this being caused by increase LAN traffic due to new roommates.\n\n\n*\n\n*Are there QoS (Quality of Service) settings on the router, and if so, how are they set?  Skype traffic would be prioritized and if the WAN is getting saturated the router might respond by temporarily shutting of lower priority connections.\n\n*Is the router CPU simply getting overloaded?  When I upgraded from 1 Gbs DSL to 5 Gbs cable service I found that my router simply could not keep up with the increased traffic and had to buy a new one. Investigate the performance of your router and see if this could be a problem.  Most routers have detailed performance reviews available on the internet; check and see how your router is rated compared to your internet service capacity. \n\n\nA: Hey guys I was having the same exact problem, but I just unplugged the headphones I was using and I have been talking with my friend for the first 10 minutes now and it still hasn't dropped, when before it dropped at 20 seconds. \nMy headphones cord was ripped so it may have been causing the problem, but I don't know much anything about the ip address and ping stuff, and this just seemed to help me out. If you try and it does not work do not blame me, because it fixed my problem.\n\nA: \nThe solution was rather simple (afterwards) removed all the unnecessary stuff from here (as zac mentioned)\nLogin:\n~/Library/LaunchAgents/ ~/Library/LaunchDaemons/ System Preferences > Users & Groups > Login Items\nStartup:\n/Library/LaunchAgents/ /Library/LaunchDaemons/ /Library/StartupItems/ >/Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginitems.plist (rarely exists)\n\ni know this is an old thread, but doing this fixed the problem i had.\nMy internet would at times disconnect and ping's would drop all the time.\nWhat would fix my problem is turning off wi-fi or ethernet (which ever i was using), then re-enable it. Of course this would only temporarily fix the problem.\nIt was weird because whenever my mac pro 4,1 would have this issue, my mac laptop would being losing pings as well. It was almost like my Mac Pro would bring down my network.\nI tried so many things! replacing the modem, router, called isp, bought usb to ethernet. none of those things worked, until i tried this!\nI did whats mentioned above and it finally fixed the problem !!\n\nA: I had a similar problem and in my case it seems to be caused by Tunnelblick, even when VPN was not connected. I uninstalled it (with the uninstaller, not just drag to Trash) and problem went away.\n", "Q: How can I record music from a MIDI keyboard with a MacBook Pro?

But now when i on the iphone it shows an empty screen with IPHONE written in bold, when i unlock it, it shows me a list to select language, when i select it shows me another lis to select country. When i select a country, it takes me to wifi and a button that shows connect to itunes. When i click on connect to itunes, it shows a usb pointing to a music icon. I can't do anything on the iphone apart from this. I don't have a wifi connection and i can't get a pc now. What can i do, please ?\n\nA: The USB pointing to iTunes icon means you need to connect your iPhone to iTunes. I think if you don't have a wifi connection and can't get to any PC with iTunes then you will have to wait until you get either one of those. Maybe you can ask a friend to bring a laptop round or go to theirs. Or try and find a wifi without a password nearby somewhere. Also I think most McDonald's have free wifi. Not sure if this will work as I haven't set up a new iOS device since 4S but go back to wifi and click skip. Then try to use your carrier's cellular network to set it up. Hope this helps.\n", "Q: Can I make a new apple ID to use for one specific game? I want to create a new, separate Apple ID to use for a specific game.

If I create a new Apple ID to use for that game, will that affect my current account? Right now, I have one Apple ID associated with everything on my 4s.\nIs there a way to do this?\n\nA: Making new Apple ID is easy but hard to manage long term. It almost certainly won't help you wi your game restart for several reasons listed below. \nUnless you have a very special game that somehow asks you to log in and doesn't use Game Center to find your Apple ID, your phone expects all games to use the same Apple ID. \nIf the developers stored your progress using iCloud, you can simply delete that game from all of your devices and when the last delete happens, it will also delete the saved progress. \nIf that doesn't work (and in many cases - especially \"free\" games, this won't work) you will need to ask game support to reset your progress or ditch that old Apple ID forever and make a new one for all your games. \n", "Q: CPU upgrade on MacBook Pro I'm thinking about upgrading the CPU in my MacBook Pro from its current 3210M dual core processor to a 3632QM quad core processor.\nIs there any reason why this wouldn't be a good idea?

This means it's effectively impossible to replace them, unless perhaps you have some high-grade industrial soldering knowledge and equipment. You can see this in iFixit's logic board replacement guide for your MacBook Pro.\nIn addition to that, I'm not aware of anywhere that you can buy individual Intel mobile CPUs. Because they're only used in laptops, they tend to only be sold to OEMs. \n", "Q: How to create a white background to a jpg/png?

I'm also only doing this for fun, so I'm perfectly okay with experimenting!\n\nA: A launchd service supports the WatchPaths option, which launches a program when the contents of a folder are changed:\n\nWatchPaths <array of strings>\n       This optional key causes the job to be started if any one of the listed paths are modified.\n\nBy watching /Volumes, a shell script can be created which would check whether your external disk is mounted or not° and run the appropriate commands°°.\n° The simplest way would be checking for the presence of a /Volumes/disk-name/ folder, but it would also be the simplest to fool with by renaming the partition or having another one with the same name, causing the mount point to be modified.\n°° It would be appropriate to use a temporary file storing the result of the last execution to avoid killing the Finder if another disk was to be [un]mounted.\n\nA: I couldn't get this to work reliably, but you could try saving a property list like this as ~/Library/LaunchAgents/showall_external.plist:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC -//Apple Computer//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd >\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n    <key>Label</key>\n    <string>showall_external</string>\n    <key>ProgramArguments</key>\n    <array>\n        <string>bash</string>\n        <string>-c</string>\n        <string>k=com.apple.Finder\\ AppleShowAllFiles\nsleep 3\nif [[ -d /Volumes/WD/ ]]; then\n    if [[ $(defaults read $k) = 0 ]]; then\n        defaults write $k -bool true\n        osascript -e 'quit app \"Finder\"'\n    fi\nelse\n    if [[ $(defaults read $k) = 1 ]]; then\n        defaults write $k -bool false\n        osascript -e 'quit app \"Finder\"'\n    fi\nfi</string>\n    </array>\n    <key>WatchPaths</key>\n    <array>\n        <string>/Volumes/WD/</string>\n    </array>\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\nIt can be loaded with launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/showall_external.plist or by logging out and back in.\nWithout the sleep command /Volumes/WD/ sometimes existed when the volume was being unmounted. The program is also run when files under /Volumes/WD/ are modified, so it checks the current value of the key first.

The value it provides here is that .dmgs are checked for consistency/correctness upon mount, so if the download went wrong you will get notified\n\n*The .pkg is the standard format for installable software and usually contains not only the application itself but all the other stuff displayed during installation: ReadMe, legal/license information, optional packages etc.\n\n*The .gz is to compress the data and keep the packages smaller on disk (and for download)\n\n*.cpio is an archive format similar to tar etc. \n\n\nA: Historically speaking, pkg format comes from Unix packages (more directly the BSD ones), which are essentially the compressed payload (files in a folder structure equivalent to one they'd end up on disk), and some additional metadata and instructions to drive the installer wizard, and write information in various system databases.\nA dmg file is just a disk image similar to what you would get with a dd-type utility. In Mac application distribution it is in a HFS format similar to the one HFS formated partitions on optical media contain. \nNow, not all DMGs contain .pkg files. Some DMG images contain just .app bundles (which, again, is nothing more than a folder with all resources an application contains, but as the folder has extension .app Quartz/Finder treat it as one file, much like they do with folders ending in .kext or .component etc.)\nHidden files are there to hide complexity, and for other \"user experience\" type reasons.\n\nA: Well, the structure of a .pkg isn't that more complex or obscure than that of a Debian .deb — both are archives containing another compressed archive for the actual contents plus metadata along it (which in a .deb is inside another layer of compression just like the payload!)\nAbout the hidden files in the DMG, there's no scientifically proven answer: one could just speculate about copy protection (an arguent which obviously doesn't stand) or an overzealous attempt to hide the \"technical background\" from the user (as supported by the contents of a [Mountain] Lion InstallESD.dmg which, not having being intended to be accessed by a human user, has some visible folders with functionality that was fulfilled by invisible ones in CD and DVD releases of Mac OS X)…\nAdd to this that since 10.5 there can be a further layer due to the existance of packages and distributions/metapackages (used to group together packages with a components-to-be-installed selector and apparently required, at least with Apple's dated and limiting PackageMaker,  to use various advanced features such as digital signatures or some system requirement checks).\n", "Q: Is it possible to publish a movie from iMovie to youtube if you have two factor authentication on? I want to publish a movie I made in iMovie to youtube but i have 2 factor authentication on.  When i enter my username and password, the login fails.  Is there any way to support this without removing the extra security?\n\nA: For apps that don't support two-factor authentication, such as iMovie, you need to generate an application-specific password. This is a computer generated password that can be used to give an app access to Google services, but is intended for use in a single app.\nGo here to manage your connected apps and application-specific passwords. Once you generate one (be sure to label it as \"iMovie password\" or similar), copy it into iMovie making sure to use your full Gmail address as the \"Account Name\", then you're done with it.\nThere's intentionally no way to view the password again, the only possible action is to revoke it. This way your account still stays secure as long as the app stores the password securely (and if it doesn't, you can always revoke that one password without causing problems for the rest of the account).\n", "Q: What does the spinning circle next to the network indicators on iOS mean? I recently got an iPhone and at first I had problems connecting to the wifi. After a while, I got it to work. Now I noticed a small circle next to the wifi icon that spins when I am going down through a timeline on Facebook or Tumblr. \nDoes this indicator mean that it is just loading? Or is it using the cellular network?\n\nA: The spinning circle icon is simply a means of indicating that some network activity is taking place, i.e. loading new data in Facebook or Tumblr. It could even be background data access like updating apps from the store or if you have background refresh enabled for some or all apps.\nIt has nothing to do with which network is being used — for that, check the cellular/Wi-Fi indicator. If the Wi-Fi icon is there, then it's the Wi-Fi network being used.\nIt's also worth noting that apps can turn on and off the indicator at will, so it's not a 100% reliable indicator that data is actually being transferred. If coded poorly, an app could activate the indicator, but neglect to deactivate it in certain circumstances.\n\nA: Just leave it alone and it'll go away. I had the same problem on my phone and it didn't go away for about a day. It turned out that I was checking how much space I had used up and it was still loading all the information.\n", "Q: Shuffling Voice Memos I've created a playlist of a selection of Voice Memos.

I want it to play all of them in a random order.  Is this possible?  If so, how would I do it?\n\nA: I've been working on the same issue and I just found something that worked.\nOnce you've created your playlist of voice memos and converted them into the AAC format, then sync your iphone/ipod.  \nTo listen to the voice memo's in shuffle: go into your music app and click artists. All your voice memo's will be under one artist and click shuffle.\n", "Q: Charging my US iPad in Israel I brought my iPad charging wire to Israel along with the necessary plug adapter.  I have not been able to charge my iPad. I also tried to charge it off of my wife's MacBook.  No go.  I called the front desk and they said it was a common problem and had me bring my iPad to them for charging.  All of my other electronic devices (SONY camera, Olympus digital dictation device, BlackBerry) are taking the charge as did my wife's MacBook.  Any idea what i need to do differently or wire that I need to buy?\n\nA: Israel has 220v/50Hz power that's standard throughout most of the world, so if there are problems with using an iPad charger to charge, it would most likely be due to substandard local power and not some problem with your equipment.\nEven in high power mode, charging from a MacBook Pro is not a good option to charge an iPad unless it's in AirPlane mode with the screen off or powered down entirely so that all the charge can go to the battery.\n", "Q: Can I disable Google Software Update for a selected user account?

I had this laptop and i know it's flash drive so i dont think there are moving parts, is it safe to shake it or move it without worry ? turn it upside down while its running ? how safe is this ?\n\nA: It's as safe as shaking an iPad or an iPhone. Just don't drop it!\n\nA: Some things I would be worried about:\n\n\n*\n\n*While it's true that the MacBook Air does not have a spinning hard drive or a cd drive, it does have moving parts, namely, the fans. These should be pretty stable, but it does show that there are loose things inside the compute that could become broken due to excessive shaking.\n\n*If the computer is running, then assumedly the display is open. In that case, I would be worried about accidentally pushing it open too far, breaking the mechanism (technically this is also a moving part). The display is also very thin, and the glass will crack if you smack it into something hard.  Personally, I would guess that the display hinge is the most likely to break if you are messing around like this.\n\n*If something other than the magsafe is plugged into it, you're liable to break the connector. \nTurning it upside down should be fine. I would avoid shaking it unless you absolutely have to. In general, if you move your computer around, there is always the risk of dropping it, or smacking or scratching some part of it on something. That risk is much higher if the display is open, because you can't hold the computer by the display, and the center of gravity is shifted away from the computer.\nI'm assuming you're in a bumpy car or something. Otherwise, why are you shaking your computer?  If it's in anger, I can tell you that while it might not technically hurt, it definitely won't help.\n", "Q: File not found: file is in ~/Library but not on 'This Mac' A program i run cannot find a specific file.

I'm still running OSX 10.5.8.\n\nA: Spotlight is intended to let users find their own files; since the Library folder normally contains files the user doesn't need to (and indeed shouldn't) access manually, it's left out of the search results (along with other \"system files\"). You can find files in it by either searching it explicitly (as you mention), or by telling spotlight to include system files in its results (see Apple's KB article #HT4355 -- note that it only mentions OS X 10.6, but the same procedure works in 10.7 and 10.8 as well).\n", "Q: Force relaunch of Finder from terminal into background For some reason, Finder is no longer running and will not relaunch using conventional methods.\nI can, however, get it running with the following command in the Terminal:\n\nprompt$ open -g     /System/Library/CoreServices/Finder.app/Contents/MacOS/Finder &\n\nDespite the fact that I'm ending the command with an ampersand and passing the -g flag to open, the resulting Finder opens attached to a completely new Terminal window that, when closed, causes the Finder application to also exit.\nHow can I relaunch the Finder from the Terminal, ensuring that it will run in the background without spawning a new shell?\n\nA: The open command exits after it opens Finder.

At the same time the Win 8 Task Manager only shows 2-3% CPU usage for all running processes. Closing Chrome in the VM immediately drops the processor usage for \"Parallels VM\" on the Mac side down to 7-8% (Windows 8 Task Manager still shows only 2-3% CPU usage by all processes).\nI can see this problem when Chrome is the only application running in the Win 8 VM.\nThis problem only happens when a web page is open in Chrome. Plug-in settings for Chrome are set to 'Click to play'. I am not clicking to play any plug-ins when I load a web page.\nSome information about my setup:\nMy Parallels VM is set to use two CPU cores. This would explain why (when Chrome isn't running) I'm seeing about double the CPU usage for the \"Parallels VM\" Mac process as I see being used by all process when viewing Task Manager on the Win 8 side, since the Mac's activity monitor reports processor usage by all cores and combines those values for the display CPU usage value.\nParallels is running in full-screen (non-Coherence) mode.\nWindows 8 Pro has all current updates installed.\nChrome 26 is a base install with default settings and no extensions are installed other than the default 'Google Docs' extension, which is disabled.\nDoes anyone else have this issue and, if so, have you found a fix?\n\nA: I had a similar problem in Windows 7 guest OS under Parallels 8. This fixed it:\nIn Chrome, go to chrome://flags and set 'GPU compositing on all pages' to \"Disabled\".

Also, it appears to be working very actively, as it is constantly warm.\nDoes anyone know what the cause of this is, and how to fix it? I do have all the latest updates, so that can't be the issue (I think).\n\nA: I would suggest backing up your phone with iTunes (a whole backup and not only synchronising) and transfer all your purchase. Afterwards, restore the phone with iTunes. \nTest it for a couple days and if the issue is solved, bring back your back up. If the issue reappears, restore it again and re-download your content manually.

(Link to previous Stackoverflow post).\nI have a vague understanding that there are hex codes involved, but I am at a point where I can't figure out where to go next to understand what's going on or what to do.\n\nA: I'd suggest to install Key Codes ($0) by Many Tricks and find out the shortcuts for yourself.\nFor instance if you want to remap the default shortcut for (forward) deleting a charcter – which is Ctrl-D (⌃D) – to be as simple as pressing the forward delete key (⌦), you would… \n\n\n*\n\n*Open the app and press Ctrl-D\n\n\n*Back in iTerm 2, add the Unicode shortcut in iTerm > Preferences > Keys\n\nNote: Don't copy and paste it, just type out the Unicode without spaces.\n\nA: The best way that I found was either with sending keycodes (as described by @pattulus or using vim key bindings.\nNote on key codes: Actually you cannot make it work by sending the unicode string as described above, you need to send both the modifier and the key to gether in case of Control+D you need to send this as code: 0x840101 0x4 where 0x840101 is the control key modifier and can be obtained through Key Code.\nNote on sending as vim sequence:\nAs described in iTerm2 documentation, you can send a key code in vim-bindings format such as \\<C-d> for sending Control+D (note that \\ is important).\nI personally prefer vim key binding because it's more readable and later you will understand what you have done.\n\nA: Those hex codes are just sequences of bytes. For example mapping a key combination to 0x66 0x6f 0x6f would make it insert foo. 0xc3 0xa4 would insert ä if you use UTF-8. 0x1b 0x1b 0x5b 0x43 means escape escape [ C.\nSome sequences of bytes like ANSI escape sequences and even single bytes like ASCII control characters have special meanings in terminals.\nTo make ⌘← and ⌘→ go to the beginning and end of line, you can assign them to 0x01 (^A in caret notation) and 0x05 (^E in caret notation):\n\n\n*\n\n*⌘←: Send Hex Codes: 0x01\n\n*⌘→: Send Hex Codes: 0x05\n\n\nYou can make ⌥⌦ delete a word forward by assigning it to \\ed:\n\n\n*\n\n*⌥⌦: Send ^[ d\n\n\nChanging ⌥← and ⌥→ to \\eb and \\ef in iTerm's preferences would also change them in programs that don't support readline or emacs-style keybindings.

Using Softtote Data Recovery for Mac, I have recovered 8000+ files. I can't use any of them. Brainstorming with the user, he forgot that he has FileVault enabled.\nIs there any way to recover data from a crashed hard drive with FileVault enabled?\nThe drive in question is an external drive that connects to the Mac using FireWire 800. We are running Mountain Lion so this is a FileVault 2 situation.\n\nA: Since it's now clear you have an external drive, I don't know how much of this applies, but I'll leave it in case it helps someone in that situation.\nI typically boot the mac into Target Disk Mode and use another Mac to enter the password for any account on the FileVault Mac to mount the encrypted core storage drive under OS X. If the Mac was set up with a recovery key, you could also use that to unlock the volume and read from the actual files and not the encrypted data.\nAt this point, you can read / write to the raw device or use the normal file system tools or run your program or Disk Warrior or Drive Genius to scavenge blocks as if the drive were a normal, non-FileVault 2 drive.\nTrying to copy the encrypted raw blocks off the drive is futile without NSA / FBI level of funding, tools and know-how. There are people that do this professionally, but I'm not one of them. Also, since your drive isn't showing the normal \"enter your password\" to unlock dialog, it's not clear you can do anything but look for other copies of the data or get a quote from a professional data recovery service to see if they are willing to try to get things back.\n\nPersonally, if I had a FileVault drive that went bad, I'd probable just call up Kroll Ontrack or another professional firm and get a quote for their assistance. In the end, it would either be data I could restore from backup, write off as a loss, or pay $$$ to get back.\n", "Q: HD failure - recovery possible if system can't see drive?

Can i not simply change a single special character from \"¬\" to \"λ\" ?\nI am currently looking at the \"Ukelele\" application but i don't want to be creating all sorts of new stuff.\nThank You.\n\nA: \nIs there a way to do this without creating a new keyboard layout? \n\nYou can do it by defining Service:\n\n\n*\n\n*Run Automator\n\n*Choose a type for your document: Service\n\n*Check Text from Library on the left\n\n*Double click Get Specified Text\n\n*On the right check Output replaces selected text\n\n*Paste your character into text editor window of \"Get Specified Text\"\n\n*Run System Preferences and choose Keyboard -> Keyboard Shortcuts\n\n*Choose Services\n\n*Find your brand new service and assign it a shortcut\n\n\nOr with key bindings.\n\nA: You might want to try just defining ¬ as λ in system prefs/language & text/text/symbol and text substitutions.  Normally you need to type a space or another character to get the switch, and there may be some apps it does not work in (Pages and Word have their own symbol and text substitution settings).\n\nA: You can create ~/Library/KeyBindings/ and save a property list like this as DefaultKeyBinding.dict:\n{\n    \"~l\" = (insertText:, \"λ\");\n}\n\nAfter reopening applications, ⌥L should insert λ in most text views. It doesn't work in for example Terminal or Xcode though.\nOther options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make a custom keyboard layout\n\n*Add characters to the press and hold popovers\n\n*Use TextExpander or a DIY alternative to it\n", "Q: How do I show content of hidden password boxes?

Memory issues I have a problem with iMovie on iPad.\nI didn't have enough space to export a project to the camera roll.

My girlfriend bought an EIZO CG223W screen and uses it for now with my apple DVI-MiniDisplay-connector, when i don't need it. She could buy her own connector, but as well could buy a PM200 cable.\nNow I'm a bit confused by the info on internet regarding the benefits of the PM200 cable vs. Apples DVI-MiniDisplay-connector:\n\n\n*\n\n*the speed and color-quality/colordepth of the PM seems to be faster, but in realworld: how much will you notice?\n\n*can you use the monitors' USB-ports only with a PM200 cable?\n\n*can you daisy-chain a 3rd monitor only when using PM200?\n\n\n(I have e-mailed Eizo already regarding this question, but didn't find an  answer yet.)\n\nA: Eizo (Netherlands) kindly and answered by e-mail. In short:\nfor using this monitor with a macbook, there is no advantage using the PM200-cable compared to an Apple mini-display - DVI connector.\nMore in detail:\n(excuse me for poor english: I used google translate)\n\n\n*\n\n*The PM200 is a cable DisplayPort cable. By using this cable you can use the EIZO CG223W-BK to give 10 bit per color (1025 tones per Red, Green or Blue). 10 Bit Color depth is as far as we know not possible on a Mac because the graphics cards do not support 10 Bit capability combined with Photoshop.\n \nTo make display 10 bit color depth you should use this configuration:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use OS or Windows 7 (older Windows OS)\n\n*Use DisplayPort\n\n*Use of good quality DisplayPort cable\n\n*Graphics card must support 10 bit\n\n*Application (software) must support 10 bit\n\n*Application requires graphics card with 10 bit support\n \nThe application and the graphics card must therefore communicate in a certain way and we only know this possibility when using windows in combination with Photoshop CS6.\n\n\n*No, the PM200 cable can only be used as a signal cable (like the DVI cable). To use hard drives and printers via the monitor always be a USB cable required. To calibrate you have this USB connection is also required.\n\n*No, the monitor can not signal to another spot or third monitor.

Although it is not a common occurrance, sometimes my cursor has a continuing spinning beach ball, which I believe to indicate that an app has frozen (correct me if i'm wrong). When this happens I usually perform an action called Force Quit as shown in the screenshot below:\n\nThis then displays the Force Quit application window, allowing an app to be selected.\nWhat other ways exist that allow for an application to be Force Quit, especially in the case that the mouse or trackpad may also becomes frozen in the event as well ?\n\nA: I see three other solutions : \n\n\n*\n\n*Right click on the icon on the dock with option key pressed. (Works only with UI Application) \n\n*Activity monitor and right click \n\n*killall/kill command in the terminal\n\n\nThe first two require the mouse/trackpad, but the third can be done with the keyboard only (spotlight to open the terminal). \n\nA: *\n\n*Type Option-Command-Esc (this is the same method you mentioned about but with keyboard shortcut)\n\n*Option-Right Click application icon in Dock and choose \"Force Quit\"\n\n*Launch Terminal and:\n\n\n*\n\n*type killall -9 application-name (e.g. killall -9 TextEdit)\n\n\n\nor \n\n\n*\n\n*type ps axc; you will get a long process list in the form:\n\n\n[...]\n6656   ??

E.g. to kill above TextEdit process you would type:\nkill -9 6656\nRemember that you are dealing with processes and every application can run one or more process, so sometimes more than one process should be killed to completely remove running application from the system. \nAlso be careful, because there is no additional warning message - be sure you are killing the right application.\n\nA: There are many ways to force quit an OS X application:\n\n\n*\n\n*Press and hold Command-Option-Shift-Escape for a few seconds. This will force quit the active application.\n\n*Press Command-Option-Escape to bring up the Force Quit window, where you can select the application you want to force quit.\n\n*Option + Right click on the Dock icon of the application and select Force Quit.\n\n*Click on the Force Quit menu option in the Apple menu to open the Force Quit dialog.\n\n*Hold shift and click on the Force Quit menu option in the Apple menu to force quit the active application\n\n*Use the Activity Monitor to force quit applications\n\n*Use the terminal to kill the process: killall safari will kill all Safari processes.\n\n\nSource: OSXDaily\n", "Q: How to customize Finder's Share menu?

But for some reason the resulting video resolution is only 1280 by 800, even thought I'm on Retina display.\nHow can I record screen in Retina resolution?\n\nA: Quicktime obeys the Displays preference pane like most other applications will.\nThe first step to increasing the resolution for recording will be to adjust the settings to have a larger equivalent screen size as I have done in this picture (and you can take things to even larger pixel counts by selecting More Space which in turn makes items like the menu bar physically smaller when rendered).\n\nIf that's not sufficient for your needs, you may need to select a tool like the Screeny app to record the \"full\" resolution. \nIn my case, I have the 13 inch MacBook Pro with Retina, so it will capture the screen at 2880x1800 no matter what setting you have on the Displays Preference when you choose \"full screen\" recording.\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.screenyapp.com\n", "Q: How to create own filename extension? I want to have an extension, named .content, to store all files in it that are linked to the filename.

If the application is signed, modifying the Info.plist invalidates the code signature though.\n", "Q: Sync iPhone Without Charging Title says it all. Is there a way to sync an iPhone with iTunes (tethered) without charging it concurrently?\nAn answer below indicated that this was possible by either modifying or purchasing a modified sync cable. If anyone knows how to do either one, please feel free to answer.\n\nA: It will likely depend on the pins you are using on the iPhone end. A modified cable should be able to cut the charge sense portion of the signal (or otherwise manipulate the call for charge signal) while allowing the sync portion of the USB signal to pass.\n", "Q: Can I use both Mac mini display ports at the same time and which adapters do I need? If I have two DVI monitors that are exactly alike, could I connect them both to the same Mac mini and extend the desktop using both displays? Can I use both the HDMI and Thunderbolt ports at the same time, and if so, what adapters do I need? \nPresumably, there is such a thing as a HDMI to DVI adapter, but what about Thunderbolt? I see that the connector of the Mini Display port to DVI adapter has the same shape as the Thunderbolt port, but will the Mini Display port to DVI adapter work? Thanks for the advice.\n\nA: You can indeed use both the HDMI and Thunderbolt ports to drive two separate monitors with a Mac Mini.\nAny Mac with a Thunderbolt port can use any mini Displayport display, cable or adapter, so you're correct that the mDP to DVI adapter is what you need1. If you have a display that requires dual-link DVI (typically only monitors with resolutions higher than 1920x1200), you'll need an active mDP to dual-link DVI adapter.\nFor the HDMI port, HDMI to DVI adapters are readily available (HDMI is essentially a superset of DVI with a different connector). Note that the HDMI port is limited to monitors with 1920x1200 or lower resolution.\n1 Note that the reverse is not true - Thunderbolt monitors can't be used with mDP equipped Macs.\n", "Q: How do I re-add a card that I swiped away from Google Now? I accidentally swiped away the Weather card in Google Now for iOS.\nTapping Show sample cards lists the Weather card, but there's no way I can add it again. Under Google Now's settings, it shows that the Weather is On, but it's just not there in my Google Now screen.\nI've also tried turning off Google Now, and turning it back on. No dice.\n\nHow do I get it back again?\n\nA: The solution is quite simple: You have to wait. \nFor me, I had swiped away the Weather card at 10 PM, and the next day I got up at 6 AM, I was greeted by the weather forecast for that day.\nNo refreshing or changing of settings worked, unfortunately.\n\nA: In some cases, you can simply Refresh the page to restore cards.\nUnfortunately, it often isn't that easy. Use the Configuration Gear. You will need to adjust the configuration of the card type that was dismissed (in this case Weather) to restore/refresh the dismissed card data.\n", "Q: FileMaker 6 and AppleScript: Deleting a Menu Item I am trying to write an AppleScript to delete or at least disable certain menu items in FileMaker pro 6. My documentation indicates that it can be done, yet even the exact examples that they give, do not work.\nHere are a few examples of some that I tried with their results:\ndelete menu item \"Delete All Records…\" of menu \"Records\" --this compiles, but returns the error 'Event not handled'\ndisable menu item \"Delete All Records…\" of menu \"Records\" --This does not even compile\nI also tried similar approaches with System Events to no avail.\nAny help on this would be greatly appreciated as I need to prevent users from deleting critical records from a database.\n\nA: It might be easier to change the user permissions so they can't delete records that the scripts use. Then you can remove the full access from those scripts. Hard to tell without looking over your shoulder or seeing something like a DDR for the database in question.\n", "Q: How to delete duplicate photo album? I wanted to create a separate photo album with my wallpapers on my iPhone 4s. So I synced the photos from my computer, but now on my phone I have my \"Wallpapers\" album and a duplicate album \"Photo Library\", I tried deleting one or the other but that option is unavailable. \nDoes anyone know how I can resolve this?\nThanks. \n\nA: From the photos app on the iphone press edit on the top-right corner and press on the minus sign before the album you want to remove. The camera roll/Photo Library cannot be deleted because it is pre-made by the operating system.\n", "Q: Can I keep track of one specific app's sales from someone else's iTunes Connect page? I'm an iOS developer, and I just found a publisher for my app - they will sell the app with their own iTunes Connect account.\nI have my own iTunes Connect account as well, and I'd like to keep track of my app's stats. My publisher says they would give me access to their iTunes Connect page, but I would be able to see their info for all of their other apps. So they suggested to use a service called Appfigures.\nI'm a bit skeptical - is there really no way I can have access to the stats of one specific application in their iTunes Connect page? If not, are there more reliable services to keep track of such data?\n\nA: They are correct, a user on iTunes Connect has access to all apps, no matter what their role. Obviously this is a terrible design, but Apple has never been too quick to fix design flaws in iTunes Connect.\nAs you mentioned appFigures has the ability to restrict a sub-user's access to individual apps. The publisher will have to set up the primary account.\nI can't find official information from any of the other analytics providers that they have this capability. My App Annie account definitely does not.\n\nA: Ultimately, no.\niTunes Connect doesn't allow for that kind of split-reporting stuff.\nBut...\nDuring WWDC 13 a new feature was announced for iTunes Connect: app transferring.\nIf possible, you could have the app transferred to your personal iTC account. I'm not familiar with your particular situation with contracts, revenue splitting, etc., but this is one way.\n\nA: I think that you need to request a financial authority to download the payments report, and then use an App to view the report. There is an App called ReportX can view the details of your App sales and provides tables and charts to sort and compare. \n\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/app/reportx/id1328409005?mt=12\n", "Q: How does an Apple device gets recognized as external storage on PC? When I connect any apple device to my PC - it gets recognized as an external storage and I can access all the files (Update:Not all the files - but just pictures) on the device. \nHow is this possible? Do all the laptops and desktop motherboards come with an Apple authentication chip and drivers ? \nI am working on a device which needs to read music files from Apple devices - so I am wondering whether I need to apply for MFI program. If the apple devices work as generic USB device without any chip and special drivers, then it serves my purpose.\n\nA: iPhone will present itself as a digital camera to a USB host so you can use camera software to import photos, such as iPhoto.\n", "Q: Is it possible to a full system Copy and run it in Parallels? i have Mac Server and i want to have a full copy of the System.\nSo i can play around and test new Software and Upgrades before i apply it to the real System.\nI am using Parallels and want to create a image from the System with the Disk Utility.\nBut i cannot find any Tutorials to do so.\nIs it even possible ?\n\nA: I don't have experience with Parallels, but if you own an external hard disk, you could clone your Mac Server to this hard disk (e.g. with Carbon Copy Cloner or also OS X Disk Utility).\nThen boot from the external disk and try whatever you want to try/install - it will not affect your Mac's internal disk. So once you disconnect the external disk and boot from your internal disk again, everything will be as it was before.\n", "Q: How can I get started with FaceTime on a Macbook Pro? I just bought a Retina Macbook pro about a week ago and I have been trying to use facetime.  When I go to select a contact, it dials them but stays in the connection position.  It just doesn't seem to make the facetime call.  \nI checked system preferences and I have noticed that Facetime isn't listed.  Shouldn't it be listed there since this is brand new?  How do i get it on my system preferences?  Do I need to turn it on?   I do have an Ipad that I do use and it works just fine.  I've even tried going to iCloud on the Mac and I don't see Facetime there either.  \nIs there a way to get this up and running?\n\nA: FaceTime is stored in /Applications/Facetime.app and all the settings and preferences you need are available from within the application's preferences and help menu.\nHere is a nice troubleshooting article that might help.\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.apple.com/support/mac/facetime/\nAlso, since you have a new mac, you should have 90 days of paid support to get you up and running. That support is really helpful for getting oriented since it's hard to expect a new user to know where to look for details on new hardware and potentially new software.\n\nA: The FaceTime app is in the Applications folder. In order to use it, you need an Apple Id. Open the FaceTime app and go to application Preferences and login with your Apple ID. After validating your Apple ID, you would be able to use it.\n", "Q: Internal Mic stopped recording voice, but hears case/keyboard touching Since this morning I am unable to record my voice on my Macbook Air 2012 internal microphone but the microphone can hear me touching the keyboard, the Macbook case…\nI tried to tweak system preferences, enabling/disabling noise ambient reduction and so on without success. Tried to reboot a couple of times with no luck.\nAny idea on what should I try next?\nI’m on Mountain Lion (10.8.3).\nScreen is\n\n\nA: Go to system preferences, open Dictation & Speech. Under dictation, change default microphone to Internal Microphone if it is Automatic. If not, switch it to Automatic for a second and switch back to Internal Microphone. I know this sounds ridiculous, but it works.\n\nA: my microphone is working on the side from your laptop use a needle to pinch and clean out the hole from the microphone\n\nA: At the moment, my best guess is that the microphone has become dislodged from its spot in the side of the case and is now just sort of floating around inside. This would explain why it picks up all the taps and noises on the case but doesn't pick up anything else well.\n\nA: Use a toothbrush and an up-and-down motion to clean the port. The microphone port on a Macbook air has incredibly narrow holes. A thin needle will only clear surface debris if that is what's causing the blockage.. \nHere's an instructional video:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aWpC8N8W08\n\nA: My Macbook Air suddenly stopped hearing me except for Dictation - no sound registered in the Sound app. I opened dictation as suggested above and magically the mic works on other apps such as OneNote. Close dictation and it stops. Makes no sense, but at least I can communicate.\n\nA: 2019 Possible Update\nI ran into this issue on my iMac Pro.  The sound input wasn't registering my voice at all, however tapping on the iMac moved the input bar.\nTo fix on Mojave, I went to System Prefs -> Accessibility -> Dictation in the left menu -> Open Dictation Preferences.  On the left side under the microphone picture, change it from Automatic to your internal microphone.  Close, go back to Sound -> Input, and you should see the needle move.\nWhat I'm running into now that as soon as I leave System Preferences, the mic stops working again.  Really annoying, but this should help people narrow down whether the issue is in your hardware or software.\n\nA: I had what sounds like the same problem and somehow either updating to the latest software (yosemite as of now) and/or opening up dictation and speech has fixed it for now. I have no idea why. But if anyone else has this problem you might as well try it if you haven't already.\nI was on skype with a friend, hung up, went to go do something else without moving my laptop at all, and then when I tried calling him again when I got back he couldn't hear me at all. I went to sound under settings first and it couldn't pick up my voice at all even though input volume was on full blast, but it could pick up if i tapped the mic with my finger. So I looked around the internet and did an smc restart, messed with terminal, messed with audio midi setup, made sure nothing was on mute. I didn't have any other mics to select other than the default so I couldn't switch that around. Finally I decided to try the free upgrade to yosemite. At first it still didn't work but then I randomly opened up speech and dictation under settings and it was all working perfectly again and I could talk on skype. BUT when I opened up sound prefs again it stopped working. Opened up speech and it was working again. Perhaps somehow those two panels turn something off and on? Very strange. Anyway I hope this isn't too incoherent as my coffee still hasn't kicked in yet but I hope this helps someone and maybe someone knows why this could work.\n\nA: 2/10/16 I had the same problem. The mic on my macbook air stopped registering sound, but the mic test sites registered key tapping. Thanks to the advice here, my husband poked into the holes with a pin, using a light and magnifying glass. Then he used a solder sucker to pull out the dust or whatever. It works like a small vacuum. It worked perfectly, without having to take anything apart! Thanks for the help. I hope my comment helps someone else.\n\nA: Could it be that the microphone is loose somehow? it could be that when you tough the case the microphone shifts a little bit and you can hear the sound when you touch the case.\n", "Q: Are there more robust tools than Automator to extract text from multiple PDF? There is an action in Automator that allows you to programmatically \"Extract PDF Text\", but it fails when fed a moderate amount of files (25 to 100).

I'd like to be able to share my iPhone's WiFi connection to my Mac.  I'm NOT asking to share the phone plan (the iPhone is actually being used as an old iPod).\nMy Mac can't connect to a wifi network because they require that you have some account that charges for it. However, the Wifi used to be free, and my iPhone still connected.  Is there a way to share the wifi connection over Bluetooth or something?\nThanks!\n\nA: No. This isn't a function of the iPhone OS from Apple. If this isn't a short term need, there might be a jailbreak tweak to turn the OS into a fully functioning router / hotspot, but the hardware isn't designed to extend a network as your use case requires.\n", "Q: Running GUI application from Console Login What I'm trying to do is after logging into the >console on my mac mini run safari. Its on\n10.6.8 if that matters, I've tried a 10.8.3 machine. Once logged in, I login as root. From here is it possible to run a browser like Safari or Firefox? \nI've tried open /Applications/Safari.app This gives LSOpenURLsWithRole() failed with error -10810 for the file /Applications/Safari.app.\nAnd I've also tried startx and open /Applications/Utilities/X11.app This throws a lot of errors on the 10.6.8 machine.\nOn the 10.8.3 machine with XQuartz installed i get the following:\nfont_cache: Scanning user font directories to generate X11 font caches\nfont_cache: Updating FC cache\nfont_cache: Done\nxauth:  file /var/root/.serverauth.5451 does not exist\n\n/opt/X11/bin/xinit: giving up\n/opt/X11/bin/xinit: unable to connect to X server: Connection refused\n/opt/X11/bin/xinit: server error\n\nIs this possible? Essentially my end goal is to, without buying Kiosk software, open GUI applications without finder or the dock.\n\nA: Safari won't run under Xquartz/X11 which themselves need a non-console session to run.\nYou could select a web browser that runs under X11 exclusively and boot to a unix OS other than OS X and accomplish your needs.\nAlternatively, you could set up a managed user on the Mac and have it launch Safari. Depending on what you need, parental controls or simple finder and dock hiding might be able to accomplish your goals - but the kiosk software is sold since they've engineered a solution where the OS doesn't have a setting to simply enable equivalent functionality.\n", "Q: Can I download older versions of apps? I've got a 1st Generation iPod with iOS 3.1, and I'm frustrated because I most apps don't run on such an old iOS, but I can't put a new iOS on. Is there eny way to get old versions of all those apps?\n\nA: I'm afraid not. You can keep running old versions of apps, but you can not download them. For example, Check the Weather was recently updated to require iOS 6. If you have an iOS 5 device you can no longer purchase it on the device, but I can keep running the version I have as long as I don't delete it.\nI understand and share your frustration.\n\nA: It's worth pointing out that whilst you can't get old apps for iOS3.x Apple do now offer the option to download the last compatible version of an app on devices running ios4.2.1+ and later. There are some catches in that you need to already have installed the app under your user ID but these are discussed in the Reddit comments and explained in this article - basically you can install the app on another device and then you'll get the option to download the older compatible version on the old device.\nFYI each app file is specific to a particular user ID so you can't just copy an app from someone/where else, though if you've got a copy of an older version of the app you can use that.\n", "Q: Preventing filesystem from locking up when automount NFS share from VM goes away I do a lot of web applications development, and I run a Fedora VM on my Mac to simulate the server environment.  Meanwhile, I run the IDE on the Mac side, and it requires a local filesystem to make changes.  Hm.\nI solved this problem by exporting my code directories in Fedora via NFS and using automount on the Mac side to automatically mount the shares as needed:\n\n# fedora:/etc/exports\n/var/vhosts/ 192.168.182.1(rw,insecure,all_squash,anonuid=1000,anongid=1000)\n\n# mac:/etc/auto_master\n...\n/vhosts auto_vhosts\n\n# mac:/etc/auto_vhosts\n* fedora:/var/vhosts/&\n\nI love this setup because it Just Works and is maintenance-free... so long as my VM is running.\nIf I suspend or shut down my VM, however, everything goes crazy.  Any filesystem-related operations take forever (even seemingly-unrelated actions like launching iTunes or shutting down my system), and the Console fills up with lots of messages from KernelEventAgent about the mount not responding.\nThe issue persists until I restore my VM state.\nOne way to work around this issue is to always leave my VM running, but that sucks up a ton of RAM, and I'd prefer to be able to suspend my VM for e.g., games or other resource-intensive apps that I might want to run.\nIs there a way I can keep my existing automount setup, but still have the flexibility to suspend my VM and have my Mac stop blocking filesystem operations waiting for the NFS connection to timeout?\n\nA: I've found that umount-ing the share will also resolve the problem each time I suspend my VM.\nIt's not a perfect solution, as it has to be done manually, but it does work.\nE.g.:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo umount /vhosts\n\n*(suspend VM)\n\n*sudo automount -vc\nI haven't tested whether step 3 is necessary, but I figure it couldn't hurt.\n\nA: You should add \"intr\" to your mount options. See the mount_nfs man page for details:\nman mount_nfs\n...\nintr    Make the mount interruptible, which implies that file system calls that \n        are delayed due to an unresponsive server will fail with EINTR when a\n        termination signal is posted for the process.\n\n", "Q: Where can one find the meid of an iOS Device?

I use the Thunderbolt display as my main and only screen while at my desk. The problem for me comes when I disconnect and take my laptop to a meeting or another location and now all the windows are over-sized for the laptop screen (ie. edges off the screen and windows much larger than the laptop screen).\nIs there a quick method or a piece of software that will auto-resize all open windows to fit in the current display?\n\nA: Have a look at Stay or Moom.\nStay is specifically designed to combat this problem. It remembers window positions for a given display configuration, then switches between them as you switch displays. So when you disconnect your Thunderbolt display, your windows will resize to your settings for internal only.\nMoom is a bit more of a general purpose window manager, it has a lot of different ways to reposition windows, but it also allows you to save sets of window positions, and you can set it to load one of those when the display arrangement matches certain rules.\n", "Q: How do I delete other available networks from network scan list? My Macbook Pro (v10.6.8) is constantly automatically connecting to a neighbor's wifi - event though I've never connected to that network, and I have my own Wifi connection prioritized.

How do I remove the list of available networks, OR disable the system from scanning the neighborhood, OR lock the Wifi connection to my in-home network? Thanks!\n\nA: You could check your \"Preferred Networks\" and make sure your WiFi Access point is listed first.\nTo do this Open the System Preferences and select \"Network\" then Select the WiFi network and click the Advanced button:\n\nWith the WiFi tab selected from the Advanced sheet you should see a list of your preferred networks, Add, Remove, Reorder as you see fit.\n\nA: There is no option to remove networks anywhere in the Network Preferences sheet.  How is one to utilize this fix without a way to delete the networks?  Not even the delete key on the keyboard is effective.\n\nA: If that network is not secured, it would try connecting to that automatically just because it is not secure.

They have VGA and DVI ports each.\nI will be using the current DVI port on the MacBook Pro.\nWill the Thunderbolt port work with a non-Thunderbolt monitor if I find a Thunderbolt to DVI-D adapter?\n\nA: I have the same MBP.  It only has a single displayport/thunderbolt output, which can drive a single monitor.  The only way for it to drive multiple external displays is to use a daisy chained Thunderbolt display, or an adapter that drives multiple displays from a single input (Matrox makes one) or possibly a usb driven adapter.\n", "Q: Can I suppress update notices for apps that require a greater iOS version than my iPad supports? I am using an iPad 1 with various apps installed. When I get app update notifications, the app may be greyed out because it requires iOS 6, which the iPad 1 does not support.

I have a working wireless connection to an access point with an internet connection (where my IP is 172.17.30.137). Over this wireless connection I am able to ping internet addresses (e.g. 4.2.2.1) as well as other machines on the wifi network (e.g. 172.17.30.1). I leave those ping processes running in the background. Now I plug in an ethernet cable, which goes to a LAN on which there is a DHCP server but no internet access. That DHCP server assigns my ethernet adapter an IP (10.35.1.100) and I am now also able to ping addresses on that LAN (e.g. 10.35.1.1). All three pings run concurrently for a few seconds to a few minutes, when suddenly the ping to 4.2.2.1 does this:\n64 bytes from 4.2.2.1: icmp_seq=1629 ttl=55 time=8.376 ms\n64 bytes from 4.2.2.1: icmp_seq=1630 ttl=55 time=14.247 ms\n64 bytes from 4.2.2.1: icmp_seq=1631 ttl=55 time=18.024 ms\nRequest timeout for icmp_seq 1632\nRequest timeout for icmp_seq 1633\nRequest timeout for icmp_seq 1634\nping: sendto: No route to host\nRequest timeout for icmp_seq 1635\nping: sendto: No route to host\n\nIt stays that way, with me having no internet access, until I unplug the ethernet cable. While this is going on I still have access to 172.17.30.x and 10.35.1.x. When I unplug the ethernet cable the ping to 10.35.1.1 starts timing out and the ping to 4.2.2.1 starts working again within a couple of seconds.\nWhat causes this? How can I fix it? Would it be helpful if I include copies of my routing table at various points in the process? How do I get that?\n\nA: You can adjust the order of your network interfaces in the Network panel of System Preferences. This allows you to set the primary adaptor for your network location, which in your case should be the Wi-Fi adaptor, since that provides the actual correct default route to the Internet.\nThe re-ordering UI is accessible by clicking on the 'gear' icon below the list of Network Adaptors on the left side of the Network Panel, and choosing \"Set Service Order...\".\nYou'll probably want to make & use a new Network Location for this setup, because in general (where either Ethernet or Wi-Fi provide valid default routes to the Internet), the Ethernet will be the better preference.\nThe same re-ordering can be useful for slightly unusual network setups, or VPNs where you may actually want all traffic to go through the VPN route (ie it should be the first service in the list) or maybe you only want the local subnet traffic on the VPN (ie your standard ethernet/wi-fi connections should precede it).\n\nA: The problem turned out to be the existence of two default routes, one of which was not valid. I reconfigured my LAN DHCP server to not specify a router and now my second default route is created pointing at simply \"link#4\" instead of at an IP on the LAN.\nI am hopeful of a solution whereby the state of the LAN's routing configuration would not impair other functionality in OSX.\n", "Q: Are the column width inches in Excel on a Mac the same as those of Windows? Are the column width inches in Excel on a Mac the same as those of Windows?\nI was given homework by my instructor and the width is far too much – so do Excel on OS X and Windows behave the same in that regard?\n\nA: An inch is an inch independently of any application or physical ruler you are using to measure it. So yes, the column widths are the same for the same number of inches on both versions.\n", "Q: Change Keyboard Layout on Lock Screen I've been struggling with the following problem:\nI am writing something in German during the day, therefore I change my keyboard layout to their QWERTZ style.\nWhen I lock the screen or close my MBP it somehow locks the keyboard style as well.\nWhen I come back and try to type my password, no success. My password has a certain special symbol that cannot be typed on the US keyboard using German layout.\nI try the shortcut to change layout and nothing happens. At the top of the screen I can't see the flags either.\nIs there a way to change keyboard layout on the Lock Screen?\nEverytime this happens I have to reset the computer using the power button, which is bad to my open applications.\n\nA: Go to System Preferences > Users & Groups.\nClick Login Options. Check the box next to Show Input menu in login window\nYou will then see a keyboard icon when your screen is locked.\nCommand + Click the keyboard icon should allow you to change the input.\n", "Q: I need help \"quitting mail\" on my Apple computer After I tried to use links in some websites, my Apple computer will not send the emails to those links nor will it allow me to quit mail. Since I cannot quit mail, I cannot get updates because the mail program interrupts the updates.  What do I need to do?\n\nA: Do you know about \"Force Quit\"? In any app, if you hold down the keys Command-Option-Escape, a window comes up with running apps where you can choose which one to Force Quit. \nPost another question here if you need help with Mail.\n\nA: Or you can go for activity monitor and select mail then click on quit button (in case application not responding the quit button will be used as force quit as well).\nTo launch activity monitor, find activity in spot light, probably the first result will be Activity Monitor then click on it.\n\n", "Q: What to use for a plain text editor? I'm writing instructions for a project and at some point, for a certain condition one needs to modify a simple plain ascii text file.\nFor windows I can tell them to fire up notepad. I thought on the mac I could use TextEdit but the TextEdit version I'm using defaults to write rtf, which introduces all rtf symbols in the file which is highly undesirable.\nUsing emacs or vi from the terminal is not something I want to burden the user with.\nWhat are alternatives?\n\nA: I also recommend TextEdit because it'll be there, no installation needed.\nIf you only need to modify an existing file, then giving it an .txt extension ensures that it opens in TextEdit in plain text mode, no surprises.\n\nA: If you want to go with Terminal you can use nano which is a fairly simple text editor but usually enough to allow Joe Random to edit basic text files. \n\nA: I would recommend using TextEdit since it is free and the default text editor on OS X.\nYou only need to learn a key shortcut (Shift-Command-T) to convert the current file to plain text.\nOf course other GUI text editors exist on Mac platform but they need to be installed from the App Store or from Internet (see other answers for a selection of the most popular ones).\nThere is even a setting in TextEdit to let all new documents start as plain text going forward:\n\nAgain, this setting is for new documents, so if a document is already open, ⇧⌘T (Format > Make Plain Text) instantly converts a rich text document to plain text.\n\nA: If you're wanting something free then you're best three would probably be Sublime Text 2, Text Wrangler and TextMate.\nThey are also extremely good for coding, but certainly appropriate as simply a text editor.\n\nA: My recommendation would be the awesome free app TextWrangler from Bare Bones Software\n\nA: I suggest Sublime Text. It is geared towards developers, but you might find it useful.  There are lots of packages and plugins for it.\n\nA: There is an unconventional platform independent solution: Etherpad \nEtherpad is an online text editor providing collaborative real-time editing of text and import/export plain text as well as other formats. \nInstall it on your web or intranet server and provide collaborative real-time editing as service. Send document links instead of documents.\nFree test services:\nhttp://beta.etherpad.org/\nMore info:\nhttp://etherpad.org\n\nA: You can also check out Notational Velocity or a wonderful fork nvAlt from Brett Terpstra. I suggest the nvAlt. It syncs with Simplenote or you can sync the notes via dropbox to your mobile devices and other computers. \n\nA: Bean is good and free: http://www.bean-osx.com/Bean.html. I switched to it from TextEdit when that one started having formatting/display issues with a lot of text snippets I copy and paste from around the Web. Bean does a better job of not letting text or graphics get lost off the page due to Web formatting quirks. Note: Bean allows multiple documents to be  opened at once, but the Window menu is under the Documents window, and it does not list the titles of open documents; it does allow one to cycle through open documents.\n\nA: Tincta is a free lightweight plain text editor for Mac. \nIt has syntax coloring, line numbers and opens multiple files in a one-window mode. I would say it is perfect for when you sporadically need to view or edit text documents and is very easy to use for novice users.\n(Disclaimer: I'm part of the Tincta development team, but it's free and really good :-) )\n\nA: @Ivana mentioned Smultron but got downvoted (I guess) because she also recommended Notepad++ in the same thread, Notepad++ being a Windows only software.\nI don't want to argue on the downvote but rather to give a chance to Smultron to be ranked higher than last, as I think it is a very good answer to the OP question. \n\nA: Editra for Mac is the closest thing I've found to Windows Notepad on the Mac.\nIt's also free, open-source, and highly configurable.\n\nA: Smultron and Notepad++ are two very good options. They both use plain text so even when the user copy-pastes formatted text, the formatting is removed. Both look much nicer then MS Notepad.\nSmultron is a small, very easy to use mac-program. \nNotepad++ is bigger with many extra options like code highlighting for many programming languages, regex lookup, code-tidying, case change to UPPER, lower and Proper, and many, many more possibilities... Notepad++ is also available for Windows.\n", "Q: Difference between mc184Z/B and mc184Z/A keyboard I recently bought an mc184Z/A keyboard but a mc184Z/B was shipped to me. Was I cheated? Or only the name changed? any way I wanted to buy a US type wireless keyboard and I got one with an international layout... :(\n\nA: If you search for MC184Z on the US store, neither part number you listed is shown. The closest match is a Dutch layout wireless keyboard.\nhttp://store.apple.com/us/product/MC184N/B/apple-wireless-keyboard\nIt's hard to know what you bought with the details you provided, but if you can link to a store listing showing the specifications, it might help us help you (or by that point, you may have your answer since the Apple pages for each item usually list the specifications for each).\nIf however you simply want a US wireless keyboard, here is the part number:\nhttp://store.apple.com/us/product/MC184LL/B/apple-wireless-keyboard-english\n", "Q: Change default installation location to install xCode I want to install Xcode in my MacBook Air OSX 10.8.3. The issue is my MacBook Harddisk is just 64GB and it's almost full. I have an external HDD (Formatted to MAC partition) and how can I install Xcode to this HDD? Because when I am trying to install Xcode I am getting an error there is no sufficient memory available.\nThanks.\n\nA: I recently moved my Xcode (4.6.2) from /Applications to /Users/daniel/Applications (I'm getting ready to slim down the main system partition to use an iSCSI target for my home folder, and want as much on it as possible).\nThe link in the comment by Buscar above isn't valid for new Xcodes that come through App Store. Instead, just move the app using Finder. You'll probably be asked to supply your credentials (due to admin permissions on some of the files inside Xcode.app).\nYou'll notice at first that Xcode starts up as if nothing happened. All seems to be well, but isn't quite, though — your Command Line Tools will be fudged. Other stuff that depend on it, like Homebrew, will fail unless you do this:\nIn Xcode, open Preferences and go to the \"Locations\" tab. The dropdown labeled \"Command Line Tools\" will be blank and there'll be a warning sign next to it.\nSimply select the Xcode in that dropdown, and after once again supplying your credentials, all is well :) Even updates will perform as expected (I updated to 4.6.3 with no issues).\n\nA: There are various possible solutions, including, making use of symlinks, dual booting two versions of macOS (one on external SSD), and many more.\nBut the best way I found was to create a new macOS user and change its home directory to external SSD (by going to advanced user settings under Users & Groups System Preferences).\nThe exact steps I followed:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a new APFS partition on external SSD with 100GB storage. (say NewVol)\n\n*Create new macOS user and change its home directory to /Volume/NewVol/user\n\n*Logged into the new user with external SSD connected, and installed xcode in ~/Application. (i.e. the local Application folder, not /Application)\nWhy this works best is because you don't need to manually manage symlinks, also symlinks might create problems during builds. All the required files (including builds and temporary files) are stored in user directory, so no space occupied on internal drive. Also, no hassle of installing a complete separate OS, and going through cycles of reboots to switch the OS.\n\nA: An idea:\n\n\n*\n\n*Move some of your data to your external HDD to free up some disk space temporarily.\n\n*Install Xcode (to your internal HDD).\n\n*Move the Xcode application to your external HDD (I believe it is OK to relocate recent versions of Xcode by dragging it in the Finder, since it is now a self-contained application).\n\n*Move your data back to your internal HDD again.\n\n", "Q: restore MacBook from sparse image I recently wiped my MBP hard drive as well as installing a new SSD.\nI have a sparseimage backup of my old drive (created with Carbon Copy Cloner) that I want to restore onto the SSD.\nI've tried to restore using disk utility but I seem to be getting inconsistent error messages.\nThe instructions on the CCC website don't seem to work for my restore.\nAny suggestions?\n\nA: Wouldn't you want to use CCC to restore the image as well? The single time I did this, I just swapped source-destination and it worked a treat. CCC should be better able to handle it's own data…\n", "Q: How can I remove a signature once it's saved in Preview.app? How can I delete a signature that I inserted using Preview.app? \nI can edit or delete all the text fields but the signature seems locked somehow.\n\nA: You cannot remove a Preview.app signature in Yosemite. This is a bug. It would almost make sense if signing a document froze the entire document,but you can edit every other annotation.\nI've tried masking a signature with a filled box, then overlaying a signature on that. It seems to work and the document saves, but on opening tne new signature is gone. (Another bug.)\n\nA: A possibility is to try\nFile > Revert To > Browse all versions...  \nthough I guess it will depend on how far back that version history goes. I've been unable to discover just how far back that would be & for how long it may be saved.\n\nA: I was able to do it by using a rectangular annotation via Tools -> Annotate -> Rectangle. Make sure it covers the signature and just make the background and border match the color of your document background (white in my case).\n\nA: Even on Mojave it still seems to be the case that once you have saved the file and re-opened it, you will not be able to remove the image.\nTo resolve this I followed the instructions in Use Preview to combine PDFs on your Mac to add a copy of the blank signature page from the original to my modified document. I was then able to edit and sign that newly-added page and so complete the document.\n", "Q: How to keep Mac alive during internet connection/download Since OS X version 10.8.1, my Mac cancels the wifi connection and switches to standby mode, despite having an active download.\nI can remember that the one advantage of the Mac was that I didn't have to do anything for that. The Mac stayed awake during downloads, so I could leave the house and if the download is finished, it would switch to standby mode.\nBut now, it activates standby despite downloading. \nHere are my energy save options:\n\nIs this a bug? How can I keep my Mac from going into standby mode while downloading?\nI have Mountain Lion installed (10.8.3).\n\nA: Caffeine is a nice tool that prevents your mac from sleeping / going to stand-by.\n\nA: This problem may not be a question of power, but badly configured wifi.\nYou may try to follow these instructions here.\n", "Q: Is there a way to get past versions of an app in App Store? Say you're running Snow Leopard, and there has been a 10.6-compatible version of an app, but the newest version requires Lion or greater. Or, say an app recently received a UI overhaul, and you'd like to buy the version that came before it was changed (perhaps the folder structure changed and broke your applescripts, or you just liked the old one better).\nApp Store only shows the most recent version of the app, so is there a way to get it to show an older version? I know, you can sometimes try buying directly from the developer, but that's not always an option, and it'll become even more rare as time goes by.\n\nA: It's not an option as far as I know. If it's an app that you purchased previously, you should be able to roll back using Time Machine (you're using Time Machine, right?). You might also have to roll back the settings files in your Library folder if you want your old settings back.\nBut if you are looking to purchase a new app you are stuck with the most recently available one.\nThe good news is that apart from Apple's own software, most developers choose to offer their software directly as well.\n", "Q: Can an Open Directory (10.8) user's home directory be changed from the terminal? I'd like to use SFTP/SSH for users (students and faculty) to manage their web content. The default home directory is \"/Users//\". I'd like to point them to something like \"/Users//web\" to block access to the other folders that are created in the home directory.\nI want to use terminal in order to avoid manually changing the setting for > 400 users. Is this possible?\n\nA: Yes, it's certainly possible, but you'll need a bit of scripting knowledge to do it entirely. I wish I had a more elegant solution to edit things in place, but here's ham-fisted option if no one has a more surgical option.\nI typically use slapcat to dump the current user details to a text file and then process is using perl or whatever other tool you want. Since it's one file, even TextEdit can do a search/replace. By putting the users in a group, you can specify that in slapcat.\nAt this point, I'd convert that text file into the import format that server app wants - see it's help guide - Server Help: Create a file to import users or groups (or click this after pasting it locally to your Mac help://bookmark='https://help.apple.com/serverapp/mac/2.2/help/index.html?localePath=English.lproj#apd41051F16-D4B7-464F-BD1C-0CBEDF7CA29A')\nAt this point you could delete the affected records and re-introduce them with the correct home directories.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro only Charging when Turned Off My MacBook Pro (2012, Retina) will suddenly not charge when it's turned on.\nIf I shut it down, it charges normally (orange led, goes green when full).\nAfter I turn it on it keeps the green led on until OSX starts up, then the light goes off.\nI haven't seen anything suspicious in the console. I also did a PRAM/SMC reset.\nOSX 10.8.3\n\nA: I had the same problem and have tried everything, with no result. Suddenly, I reset the SMC without turning off the MacBook Pro, i.e. with the MBP on and the charger plugged, I hit Shift+Ctrl+Alt+ON for ten seconds (the MBP switches off instantaneously). After restarting, the mac was charging properly.\n\nA: I went to Apple Support and even though it looked like a software issue, they just exchanged the power supply and now it's working perfectly again.\n", "Q: Which presentation remote controls are OS X compatible with Powerpoint? I'm looking for a remote control to use for controlling a Powerpoint presentation, and want it to be compatible and reliable w/ OS X.

I have missing notes that appear to be deleted. I have been trying to get on to iCloud to see if I can find them ther, but I can't seem to login. I'm going through a divorce & have important notes. It seems like my wife has somehow logged into my iCloud account & deleted them. Is ther a way to find them? \n\nA: The simply answer is, unfortunately, that it will likely not be possible to recover notes that were deleted through iCloud. \nYour only possible way to recover the notes would be if you have Time Machine backup on a OSX computer that is logged into your iCloud account. Honestly, even for this to work would be highly unlikely.\nIn the future, check out Evernote, or Google Drive to store your important notes.\n", "Q: Mac Won't Remember Hostname in Terminal After Reboot, gives 'unknown...' I'm trying to set my hostname for my mac.  Currently it's unknown002374e31ebd.\nI've tried setting it with\nsudo hostname -s Steve-Mac\n\nWhich will work for all future terminal sessions.  However, if I restart, it goes back to unknown\nHow can I get it to keep this setting?\n\nA: Setting the hostname via the Terminal is not permanent.\nFrom the hostname manpage:\n\nDESCRIPTION\n  The hostname utility prints the name of the current host. The super-user can set the hostname by supplying an argument. To keep the hostname between reboots, run `scutil --set HostName name-of-host'.\n\nAlternatively, set the hostname in your System Preferences, under the Sharing section.\n\nA: Fastest way is to setup it in System Preferences -> Sharing (unlock screen by clicking padlock on bottom) and then change name and Apply.\n", "Q: Prevent itunes from synching apps I am looking for a way to prevent iTunes from synching app to the iphone.\nCurrent situation: \nI only back the iphone up with iTunes - icloud backup is not feasible to me - and connect it to iTunes a couple times a week.\nDuring this time I add/delete apps on iphone: every time I synch it to iTunes it will copy every new apps AND install app that were present the last time I synched but have now been deleted. \nHow I wish it would behave: \nevery time I synch I would like only the app data to be backed up and the apps left alone.\nPlus, I would like to regain the 4-5 gb of space that the useless ipa files are using in the main drive.\nAny hint?\n\nA: I have many devices that sync with my Mac and carry no apps on iTunes, so it's possible. I don't back any of them up to iTunes though and use iCloud for that.\n\n\n*\n\n*Make a back up of your Mac/PC in case the iTunes changes need to be reversed.\n\n*Uncheck the box in iTunes that says \"install new Apps automatically\".\n\n*Choose to back the phone up to iCloud rather than to the computer\n\n*Delete all apps from iTunes so your Library looks like this when you view apps (you can move them to trash now or leave them in the library folder as you choose)\n\n\n*Test a sync of the phone to see if the apps transfer back\n\n\nGoing forward, purchased apps will not transfer back to iTunes from the device. Backups only back up user data and not apps - independent of whether apps themselves sync.\nOnce you've turned off syncing of apps for all iOS devices, you can empty the trash and rejoice that iTunes doesn't get apps unless you download them explicitly. Also, if you didn't move the apps to the trash, you can go in and delete or file them elsewhere since iTunes isn't tracking those files as part of your library now.\n", "Q: Mac crash after installing XCode I tried installing XCode on my MacBook Pro, but for some reason, it suddenly crashed. After a reboot, I saw a message my computer had to restart because of some system failure. After this message, I get the following text on my screen...\n\nDoes anyone have any idea what this text means and what to do about it?\n\nA: From the loaded kernel extensions in the backtrace, we can see that com.apple.iokit.CHUDKernLib is the bundle identifier of the kernel extension that is causing the kernel panic.\nThat makes sense, as the CHUD tools are part of the older Xcode installs.\nIf you're comfortable with the command line, what I would do is start up in single-user mode by holding down Commmand-S right after you start up your machine.\nAt the prompt, type the following and press return:\nmount -uw /\n\nThis will mount the filesystem in read-write mode so you can make changes.\nThen type the following 4 commands, pressing return after each line.\nMake an \"ExtensionsDisabled\" folder to move the CHUD-related kernel extensions to:\nmkdir /System/Library/ExtensionsDisabled\n\nChange the current directory to the kernel extensions folder:\ncd /System/Library/Extensions\n\nMove the 3 CHUD*.kext kernel extensions to the disabled folder:\nmv CHUDKernLib.kext CHUDProf.kext CHUDUtils.kext /System/Library/ExtensionsDisabled\n\nReboot:\nreboot\n\nIf you're not comfortable with the command line, you could start up in safe mode and delete (or disable by moving elsewhere) the following 3 files: \n/System/Library/Extensions/CHUDKernLib.kext\n/System/Library/Extensions/CHUDProf.kext\n/System/Library/Extensions/CHUDUtils.kext\n\n\nA: That is a kernel panic during the pre-launchd portion of the startup cycle. The Apple signifies that the kernel has been loaded and the system is loading kext to get read to start launchd and load actual programs and user items.\nYou'll need to troubleshoot this or just try reinstalling the OS (erase if needed) if you have a good and recent backup of the user data.\nIf you don't have a backup or want to troubleshoot this for learning purposes, I would start as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Review Apple's troubleshooting guide:\n\n*\n\n*OS X: About kernel panics\n\n\n*Unplug all accessories (yes even keyboard, monitor, everything - and then only connect the things you need and only when you need them)\n\n*Boot to safe mode to see if it's a non-essential kext or configuration that's causing the panic. (so - I would try a safe mode boot with only a USB keyboard connected- wait 5 minutes and then plug in the monitor if it's a desktop Mac)\n\n*Make a backup if you can boot into safe mode.\n\n*Boot into recovery mode (or target mode) and make backups of any files you need.\n\n*Resintall the OS (this shouldn't erase any user data and hopefully it will fix the panic).\n\n*Optionally you can pause and dig into the /private/var/log/panic.log contents to see if you want to remove any third party kernel extensions.\n\n\nOf course, it could actually be a hardware error and the Xcode install is pure coincidence (you needed to be doing something right before it failed), but there are lots of things you can do before taking it in for service in most instances where a KP happens at boot.\n", "Q: not using Apple Mail, but using Calendar I use gmail through the web interface, but have Apple Calendar synchronising with google's calendar. I don't want to use Apple Mail for anything at all. Every time the calendar synchronises with Google, Apple Mail opens and asks me to set up an account. How do I stop Apple Mail from doing this?\nI have Mac OS 10.8.3. In System Preferences, under Mail, Contacts & Calendars, I have my Google account specified, but with \"Calendars & Reminders\" checked and the remaining options (Mail, Messages and Notes) unchecked.\n\nEDIT: after some poking around, it seems the problem is that Calendar wants to open Apple Mail to send me reminders about my events. Can I stop it from doing that? \n\nA: In short, you don't. Calendar needs mail to send and receive appointments.\nHave you tried simply telling Calendar to not use Mail for automatically retrieving CalDAV appointment requests via Mail?\nWanting to use Calendar for OS X implies you must use Apple's Mail for CalDAV appointment invitations as things stand today on Mountain Lion. You could either forego the Mail integration or select another Calendar like Fantastical or BusyCal.\n", "Q: What's a good tool to jailbreak iPad mini? I just bought myself an iPad mini and I'm wondering what is a good tool to use to jailbreak it and hopefully without breaking the device. I've heard a couple names like Evasi0n and Redsn0w but am unsure of their reliability. So, what's a good and safe tool to use to jailbreak it?\n\nA: I'd use evasi0n - it is fully compatible with the iOS 6 and hence the iPad Mini. The process if fully automatic. More about how to jailbreak here: How to jailbreak iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch running iOS6? \n\nA: If you are running iOS 5, use Absynthe instead.\n", "Q: Remote Ubuntu Screen sharing from Mac I want to connect to an Ubuntu machine from MAC far far away! I have the application Remoter that works like a charm for ssh and connecting to other Mac. However I don't know how to connect to an Ubuntu machine. \n\nA: In general terms, you'll need to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Set up a VNC server on the Ubuntu machine. This is the software that shares the screen.\n\n*Set up a means of connecting remotely to the Ubuntu machine. If you can already SSH in, that's the best way, you can forward the VNC port over SSH by running this on your Mac: ssh username@ubuntuhostname -L 5900:localhost:5900, replacing the username and ubuntuhostname as appropriate.\n\n*Connect with VNC to the tunnel. You can do this with whatever client you like (including OS X's built in screen sharing), but the important part is that the hostname to connect to is localhost and you use port 5900.\n\n\nIf you need more specific instructions, I suggest you do a search, as most of these topics have been covered in some detail elsewhere. Ask Ubuntu is the best place to go if you need Ubuntu-specific information.\n\nA: While the native way has been described correctly in the answer by robmathers above, you could simply install the same version of TeamViewer (currently that means installing version 8) on both Ubuntu and your Mac to get around the hassle of correctly setting up Firewalls, SSH tunnels and the VNC server. TeamViewer is free for private use.\n", "Q: Greyed out songs when trying to add from iTunes to iPhone? I just got an iPhone 4 and downloaded the most recent version of iTunes onto my computer because I had a version that was too old. It told me I needed to convert the songs to create an AAC version of my library in order to sync them to my iPhone, which I had not synced because I didn't want to lose the existing music. When I converted the files, they copied to the phone, but are greyed out and won't let me play them, could somebody please help?\n\nA: Try playing the greyed out songs directly on your iPhone. If you cannot do that, do the following. \n\n\n*\n\n*Ensure that the greyed out songs are indeed playable within your iTunes library (not within the iPhone section of your iTunes library)\n\n*Connect your iPhone to your iTunes, navigate to your iPhone section > music, select all greyed out songs and delete them. \n\n*Make sure that the \"Sync music\" and \"Entire music library\" options are ticked under the \"Music\" tab and sync your iphone once again with iTunes.\nThis should resolve the issue.\n\nA: I made a playlist, copied and pasted the songs from the old one, and deleted the old one.  I re-synced the phone and it worked.  It worked for all of them just by recreating one.\nThis solution fixed the grey circles next to 60% of my songs.  I planned to make all new playlists but started with one as a test. \nI chose a playlist where I had just purchased a new song today.  Perhaps that caused a jam somewhere.  Hope this helps someone.\n\nA: I solved this issue by selecting a song (or songs, one whole album), right-clicking, and selecting \"Uncheck\" selection.  Then did the same to \"Check\" selection and it began syncing (\"un-greying\") all of the songs in my library that were stuck like that.\n\nA: I hope anyway who has this 'kind' of problem, greyed out songs. And they like to delete them forever. then continue reading\nI don't want to advertise programs but I think it solves it quickly , and yes it really did work for me. I was really fed up using itunes and having those unsynced music. \nProgramm is called 'Copytransmanager. (google it up, read reviews and you'll see!)\nWith this programm i easily deleted all the greyed out songs, unlike using itunes which I stucked on over 3 weeks. Of course there are plenty other programms to do this, but I read a lot on other forums etc people got this problem. So I'm just post here quickly to help!\nI think once you've downloaded it, it's easy to find out how it works. (simple design, though it's not as clear as itunes. \nGreetings and I hope a few could use this information. Once again, I do not like to promote/advertise other programs but sync/resync doesn't seem to solve for some.\n*Also if you like to keep those 'greyed' tracks, they: make a backup somewhere and you can put them back on with itunes or just CopyTrans again.\n\nA: I had this same problem: After dragging songs from library to phone, I looked at the music on my phone (from the iTunes' PC interface) and saw the songs listed but \"greyed-out\".\nSolution:\nI clicked on Music underneath My iPhone on the sidebar. On the bottom right of the screen there is a button called Autofill located next to a button called Settings. I clicked the Autofill button, and it said that I could not add any more music because all of the space was reserved for data. If you get that message when following the steps above, try this:\nIn that same tab, to the left of Autofill on the right, click Settings. There is a slider located at the bottom of the dialogue box that pops up which allows you to define how much space is reserved for data (non-music data.) If that slider is all the way to the right, you will not be able to add any songs to the iPhone manually. Slide the bar to the left to allow for more space for music, the try adding your songs. Worked for me.\n\nA: If you drag the music from your ITUNES LIBRARY to the Iphone (drag it towards the right side of the screen where it says Iphone), then it will no longer be greyed out!!! :) And it will not sync anything.\n\nA: Just fixed this problem on my iPhone 4S. Simply select all greyed out songs (Edit -> Select All) drag them to trash and voila - you can start dragging and dropping music from your library.\n\nA: Simple fix for me.....I found that it was the format of the songs. I made an mp3 copy in my tunes of the purchased songs, and they showed up with normal text. I was then able to copy the purchased songs to my devices.

I'm running a MacBook Pro, Mid 2010 model, that I recently upgraded to Mountain Lion. Around that time, or maybe shortly after, I began noticing some problems that I can only attribute to a general slowdown in accessing files on my hard drive. I have 8GB RAM, and rarely run out, so I don't think it's just a matter of paging vs not paging.\nThe evidence is reasonably convincing. For example, I'm a Java programmer and use NetBeans. The app I have configured takes over a minute on this machine to run, but only 30 seconds or so on a more-or-less identical setup on a much weaker machine: a late 2008 MacBook with only 4GB RAM. And what it's mostly doing is reading and processing several hundred files of various kinds.\nSo far, though, the evidence is entirely anecdotal. I'm looking for some kind of test I can run that will see whether my file system/HDD is performing as expected or whether it's something else entirely. Also something I could take to the Apple Store and say, \"look this thing says there's a problem.\" Does such a thing exist?\nEdit: another interesting difference. This Mac takes just shy of three minutes to reboot (that's desktop disappearing to desktop reappearing). The older MacBook I'm comparing against (also running 10.8.3) takes just over one minute.\n\nA: The upgrade might have corrupted your Spotlight index - which would result in the computer constantly reindexing itself (or at least, seeming to). I've heard this is a common occurrence when upgrading through OS X - it happened to me when I upgraded to Lion.\nYou can destroy the Spotlight index by doing the following:\n\n*\n\n*Go to System Preferences → Spotlight → Privacy and exclude your HD, reboot and then include it again. This should prompt Spotlight to reindex (having destroyed the old index). Source\nIf that doesn't work, try deleting the Spotlight index manually. This will force it to reindex.\n\n*\n\n*In terminal run man mdutil - this will allow you to verify by using the manual function that this is a command related to spotlight.\n\n\n*Once satisfied run mdutil -i off, switching off the Spotlight index.\n\n\n*Run sudo rm -rf /.Spotlight-V100 This will delete the entire Spotlight cache.\nYou may prefer to rename it using sudo mv /.Spotlight-V100 /disabledspotlight - it will have the same effect, and gives you a backup.\n\n\n*Run mdutil -i on to restart indexing.\n\n\n*Leave for a few hours while it does its thing.\nSome references as to the safety of doing this:\n\n*\n\n*MacRumors Forum Thread: \"Is .Spotlight-V100 safe to remove?:\n\n*Apple Support Communities Thread: \"Removing/deleting Spotlight-V100?\"\n\n*the Apple Genius that helped me when I was having Spotlight issues.\n\nThis could be totally off, and not your problem at all - but on the other hand, it might help.\n", "Q: Mail count with Automator? I am trying to create file containing different statistics about things such as email count and such things, trial here: this proto returns empty file, not sure why.

It's like typing on an LCII that is trying to run Mac OS X. As I type, the computer seems to be thinking ridiculously hard about what it is doing. Periodically, these silly character suggestions will appear next to the cursor:\n\nThe response rate is so bad that I am literally typing this message one painstaking character at a time, and waiting for it to appear on the screen before typing the next.

I haven't been able to find any info in the Apple forums about it, I'm guessing because I don't know what this phenomenon is called.\n\nA: The characters appear when a key is held down, it's the same as on an iPhone to make it easier to type accents and things. Those are alternative S characters.\nYou can turn it off using:\ndefaults write -g ApplePressAndHoldEnabled -bool true\n\nin Terminal.\nHowever, that doesn't explain the overall response rate, just the characters.\nFor the keyboard rate check Accessibility in System Prefs.

On my MacBook Pro 13\" (mid 2012), It doesn't seem to have the option in settings. Is it not possible with these computers?\n \n\nA: All PowerBook and MacBook models support analog audio in via the headphone jack.\nIn your specific case, it is possible to use external microphone on MacBook pro and Air 2012 Models.\nIt looks like Apple has redesigned it to be a multifunction plug, without telling us in plain English. What they do say is you can use the Apple iPhone headset with microphone! Now that is a Hint !\n\nSince there are multiple options to connect a microphone lets take a look.\n1 - For stand alone microphone with cable you could use a USB connector type or Audio to USB converter.\n2- You could use a BlueTooth type microphone/Headset.\n3 - And last not least, you could actually use your Headphone (as marked) the 1/8 inch plug, but NOT with standard audio plug.\nHere is the how: The plug is like the headphone port on iOS devices, this jack supports audio input as well as output—with as described in Apple specification.\nLooking under the hood of Apple \"About this Mac\" you get the answer (it says it does support it).\n\nThe microphone or headset in question must be of the three-ring variety, just like Apple’s headsets. The fourth pin (ring) is for the microphone !\n\nOK, what now? Lets assume you insist on using your microphone!!!\nGet the 3.5mm 4 Position to 2x 3 Position 3.5mm Headset Splitter Adapter - M/F\n\n... this headset splitter adapter breaks the audio port out into two distinct ports - one that can be used for a microphone input connection, and the other for connecting external (output) speakers.\nI found stores in Europe (for about €10), but sure you can find it where you are.\n\nA: I post my solution hoping it can help someone.\nI've have a MBP mid-12 13in, with the so-problematic unique audio jack.\nI'me sure that external&internal usage is possible because of the iphone headset test.\nSo I bought the TRRS cable, and my first tests fails: I got an external audio detected, but no luck with the internal line.\nThen, I found an amazon comment about the cable, solved:\n\n\n*\n\n*First, connect your external and internal lines to the Y cable\n\n*Second, connect the Y cable to the MB\n\n*It should take a couple of seconds to be recognised as an external mic\n\n\nWhen I trying it fails again. But I've found the trick:\n\n\n*\n\n*The internal line must be a microphone\n\n*So after being detected by the MB as an external mic, you can unplug the mic and connect anything else (an iphone)\n\n*Note: I've can only testing with a cheap non-powered computer mic\n\nA: Yes, it seems the option is missing from your settings: this is what that preference panel looks like on my machine (13-inch, Mid 2009) (with nothing plugged into the audio port):\n\nUnfortunately it looks like audio input isn't implemented on your model :(\nThe tech specs for MacBook Pro (13-inch and 15-inch, Mid 2012) have the following for the 13-inch:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Headphone port\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Support for Apple iPhone headset with remote and microphone\n  \n*Support for audio line out (digital/analog)\n  \n  \n\n... it doesn't mention audio line in (which it does for the 15-inch).\nSorry for the bad news.  One workaround is to buy an audio input device which plugs into USB.\n\nA: The Griffin iMic is probably the most commonly touted solution for this \"new\" problem. This way you can monitor through the headphone jack, and the USB headphone jack also....I would assume. Maybe it's one or the other, however. \nEither way the digital solution may improve signal quality also. There are other cheaper versions of the iMic but it seems Griffin was like \"Hey Apple, want to make a computer that's missing stuff so we can make some more money?\"\nhttp://store.griffintechnology.com/catalog/product/view/id/623/?gclid=CLKDicGj1b0CFQaTfgodJqUAVA\nIf the link breaks just look up griffin iMic. It appears B&H currently sells it for $23.78\nI've also seen similar products via https://www.google.com/#q=usb+to+3.5mm\nI hope this helps with the \"no line-in\" problem on the 13\" MacBooks and the new 27\" iMacs. As well as the \"My line-in doesn't recognize my mic\" problem. \nAlternatively try that 3.5mm 4 Position to 2x 3 Position 3.5mm Headset Splitter Adapter - M/F that Buscar mentioned above. \n\nA: You can connect an external mic only if it has 4 pins on the 3.5mm jack. The MBP Mid 2012 takes some time to recognise the mic so just wait a little bit. You should see 'external mic' appear in System Preferences>Sound>Input\nIf your jack does not have 4 pins, i think that you can use a 3.5mm female to 3.5mm male 4 pins converter... But the 4 pins are very important to make it work.\nHope it helps\n\nA: MY COMPUTER SETUP\nMy mid-2012 MacBook Pro (\"MBP\") does NOT have a port labeled for microphone, but it DOES have a 3.5mm (1/8\") port labeled with a Headphone (not headset) icon.\nPROBLEM\nWhen I plug a microphone's 3.5mm TSR plug (TWO black stripes alternating with THREE shiny metal bands) into that headphone port, the MBP does not recognize or receive the microphone's signal/audio.\nCLUE\nBUT, when I plug in a headset (combined speaker and microphone) that has a 3.5mm male TSSR plug (THREE black stripes alternating with FOUR shiny metal bands), the MBP DOES recognize and receive the microphone's signal/audio.\nPROPOSED SOLUTION\nI have ordered a splitter (analog, known as \"auxiliary\" and \"audio\" splitter), that has one 3.5mm male TSSR plug on one end, and 2 female 3.5 female ports (unknown if TSR or TSSR) on the other end. Supposedly, one female port will provide microphone input, and the other female port will provide headphone/speaker output.\nFrom everything I've read and researched, I'm pretty sure this will be what's needed to get microphone in and audio out from the one \"headphone\" labeled 3.5mm port on the MBP.\nI'll try to remember to come back here to update once we get that splitter (http://www.dukabel.com/product_D1M2FFL30.php), to let you know if it works :-)\nALTERNATE SOLUTION\nAlso, in the meantime, we are achieving microphone input into the MBP using an old Griffin \"iMic\" USB microphone adapter. Griffin doesn't make it anymore (due to incompatibilities with new 64-bit computers, they told me on the phone a couple days ago), but it works great for the mid-2012 MBP we have right now :-)\n\nA: You can use a Playstation 2 singstar microphone USB converter (3€) on any macbook pro \n\nA: Try removing the soundflower driver. \n", "Q: Exclude apps from iPhone/iPad backup?

Apparently I changed the default to Gmail and now those notes do not appear on the Mac. I have tried changing Mac settings and accounts.\nIs there a way to change the setting on the individual note so it syncs with a new account on the phone, such as from Gmail to iCloud, or do I have to manually retype the notes after setting the note default to iCloud from Gmail?\n\nA: You can share the Notes created under your Gmail account by adding the Gmail account that you're using on your iPhone to your Mac. To do this, go to Settings → Mail, Contacts & Calendars. Select the Gmail button and add your account information and be sure to check the box next to Notes. If you already have your Gmail account set up on your Mac, follow the same instructions but when you access the Mail, Contacts & Calendars area click on the Gmail acct on the left and a list of options will show on the left. From there you can see if the Notes option is selected. If not, check the box and they should sync. One caveat: some CalDAV notes show up in Mail app instead of the OSX Notes app. I'm not sure about Gmail.\nIf none of the above work, I recommend checking Help online in Gmail (or similar; that's how I solved a shared calendar sync problem.\n", "Q: Is there anything like /etc/hosts at user level in mac?

So is there anything I can use at user level?\n\nA: There is nothing you can do to block specific Youtube content from within the system. But you have two options to avoid the problem:\nOption 1: If you want to completely keep your son from visiting Youtube, create a new user account for him. Enable OS X's parental controls on that account and block Youtube.com. You will still be able to visit Youtube from your account. Set a password for your account. You can find instructions for setting up parental controls in OS X here.\nOption 2: If you want to keep your son from watching videos that have been marked by the Youtube community as inappropriate for children, turn on Youtube's parental controls. Refer to the following instructions: Youtube's parental controls\nNote: Both options, specially the first one, will make your son be able to tell that you are using parental controls. If you don't want him to know the only option is editing /etc/hosts, but it'll be easier to just let him know that you don't want him to watch specific videos or spend so much time on Youtube.\n", "Q: How to get Mountain Lion to recognise modifier keys from external Windows keyboard By default, Mountain Lion maps Windows-key to Command and ctrl to ctrol.

It did not. \nStrangely, I noticed that my USB stick does not light up when I unplugged it and reinserted it when my mac is in the boot menu. Normally the usb stick will light up when inserted into this usb port. \nI thought my ISO is not bootable so I tried another windows 7 ISO and the results remain the same. \nIs it possible that my model is too old such that it doesn't allow booting from USB during boot time? Is it possible that older ROMS do not check for USB drives during boot time (hence explaining why my usb doesn't light up)? \nI can assure you that my usb port is functioning correctly (at least during Mac OS X run time). \n\nA: rEFIt is a useful utility for selecting boot partitions that don't necessarily show up normally (Linux bootloaders, incomplete installs for example, or if there is something out of sync with the boot sectors).\nYou could use it here to see if it can recognise your USB stick, you could also use it to boot Windows from FireWire if that's at all useful.\nYou'll need a second usb stick to run it in 'live boot' mode, if you don't want to have it installed on your system, but it's pretty small so even 20MB is enough. Download the disk image and use Disk Utility to clone it onto your second usb stick, then boot with option held and it will appear.\n\nA: All macs boot from USB. You'll need to troubleshoot further why the images you have are not blessed properly. It's rare to find a USB drive that isn't bootable, but that too might be worth investigating.\nI'd try installing OS X onto that USB drive to test whether it's a hardware issue or due to the software steps you are performing. There's not a good way to boot to single user mode and then select another volume to boot, so you pretty much use the system preference to set a boot volume or use the option key to use the Boot Selector GUI that's in each Mac's firmware to bless and set the startup boot list in NVRAM.\n", "Q: Disable line wrapping for output in the Terminal I often read outputs in the terminal that get wrapped as they are too long. Since there is no way that I can modify the printed output, I need to let the Terminal allow for horizontal scrolling.\nIs there a modification I can make to the default OS X Terminal to disable line wrapping and allow for horizontal scrolling?\nOr do you know another alternative I can use?\n\nA: tput did the trick for me:\ntput rmam\n\ndisables line wrapping.\ntput smam\n\nenables line wrapping.\n\nA: iTerm 2 doesn't seem to support disabling line wrap either. You might just use less or cut though:\nless /var/log/system.log\nexpand /var/log/system.log | cut -c 1-$COLUMNS\nless -s <<< \"$(osascript -e 'tell app \"Terminal\" to contents of window 1')\"\n\n\nA: If you are (as others suggest as a solution, although I think you asked about direct output) then redirect output to a somename.log file and open it with Applications>Utilities>Log-Viewer (or from commandline as  open somename.log).  \nIt's not in the terminal but I found the log viewer to the one best suited to deal with large amount of output (searching, scrolling, filtering).\n\nA: Use cut\nmyscript | cut -c -100\n\n\nA: Pipe the output through less -S:\n   -S or --chop-long-lines\n          Causes lines longer than the screen width to be chopped (truncated)\n          rather than wrapped.  That is, the portion of a long line that does\n          not fit in the screen width is not shown.  The default is  to  wrap\n          long lines; that is, display the remainder on the next line.\n\nI tried to explain what might be going on here, though this won't result in a way to scroll horizontally with a scrollbar, as you seem to want.\n\nA: Depending on what you are trying to stop wrapping you could use vim.  So launch vim on the file with the long lines, and then type:\n:se nowrap\n\n\nA: I suggest using lnav (easily found), it is a fantastic log and stream viewing tool and by default does single lines with horizontal scrolling. All movements by keyboard keys. You can also easily hide lines matching grep patterns so that you can concentrate on the most relevant data.\nI use it almost ALL the time.\n", "Q: apple.local Dock[255]: ECFileOperationRevealURL failed with -43 Cmd+click on any file can reveal them in Finder but now takes no effect.\nI reviewed the console log and found following error:\nMay  2 00:14:12 apple.local Dock[255]: ECFileOperationRevealURL(file://localhost/Users/suyejun/Downloads/code/) failed with -43\n\nI installed PathFinder and uninstalled it after I found this error. But the error still exits.\nI'm sure that before installing PathFinder, the functionality is ok.\nHow can I fix this? Thank you.\nOS X Mountain Lion (10.8.3)\n\nA: I suspect that PathFinder isn't actually the culprit here.  I downloaded and extracted (although didn't install) PathFinder, and searched for ECFile, and found no matches:\nMitsu:Contents ashley$ pwd\n/Users/ashley/Downloads/Path Finder.app/Contents\nMitsu:Contents ashley$ find . -type f -exec grep ECFile {} \\;\nMitsu:Contents ashley$\n\nI suspect ECFileOperationRevealURL is actually the name for some code within the Dock application itself.  I say that because I found the text ECFileOperation in a 2007 webpage where people are discussing features added to the Dock in a beta release of OS X 10.5.  I can't verify this easily on 10.8, though, as /System/Library/CoreServices/Dock.app/Contents/MacOS/Dock is now an apple-protected (encrypted) binary, which can't be meaningfully searched with grep as above.\nSo, some suggestions:\n\n*\n\n*Just to check I have the right end of the stick: you are saying that if you cmd-click an icon in the Dock, nothing happens, except that you get an entry in console.log?\n\n\n*Is this true for both applications (to the left of the Dock separator line) and folders (to the right)?  (Assuming you have the Dock on the bottom of the screen.)\n\n\n*If you create a new user account (for testing only), does the problem persist there?\n\n\n*If the problem goes away in the new user account, try moving ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.dock.plist to another location temporarily (say your Desktop), then restart.  This should reset your Dock setup.  If this fix doesn't work, you can always put the file back.  If it does work, I'd suggest setting up the Dock again from this fresh start.\n", "Q: How do apps get loaded on iOS for free I have Googled over and over and cannot get an answer to a fundamental question I have. To get an app downloaded onto an iPhone, do I need to open an apple account of some sort and pay for the account or is there a way to host the app (for free) and get it downloaded to an iPhone for free?\nThank you for helping me get started here.\nAddendum\nLet me clarify my question.\nI am starting to build my own little app. I'm a web developer looking to move into mobile app development. I want my family to be able to download it and use it on their iPhones.\nSo, can I host my app for download onto their iPhones? Can I host it somewhere else where people can down without cost? Or is the only way to get an app downloaded to an iPhone is through Apple by registering with them to do that? And if Apple is the only way, do they offer free accounts to do that?\n\nA: Web apps are easy, you just need to use Apple Configurator or the iPhone configuration utility to package the URL and add it to the home screen. You can also perform this from mobile safari directly.\nYou only need a web server and there are plenty of free web services if you don't want to host the app on a computer you control and could run MAMP or some other tool to serve http.\nOnce you cross over into native apps, it gets more complicated. There is an API and it's secured by digital signatures to ensure the OS can track the application's provenance and detect if it gets modified after it has been installed.\nIn general, iOS supports four major ways to load native applications. The first three require Apple to be involved and all carry a financial and time cost. The fourth bypasses the code checks and allows unsigned apps and has no financial cost but carries a different time cost. \n\n\n*\n\n*Through the iTunes App Store once the app is signed directly by Apple\n\n*As a paid developer by signing the app with a developer certificate (which itself is signed indirectly by Apple)\n\n*As an enterprise customer by signing the app with an enterprise certificate (which itself is signed indirectly by Apple)\n\n*Jailbreak the device to load apps that are not signed by Apple (directly or indirectly)\n\n\nSince you mentioned free:\n\n\n*\n\n*Jailbreak should cost nothing, you just spend time learning and obtaining free software to jailbreak each device.\n\n*Paid iOS developer requires a Mac with a recent OS X (not free), Xcode (free) and a $99 one year window to run all your apps on a limited set of iOS devices (100 at the moment) for that one year period.\n\n*App Store Distribution requires a delay (where Apple decides if they even want your specific version of your app to be on their store) and costs nothing during the year your paid iOS developer account is valid. If your paid developer account expires, your apps come off the store.\n\n*Enterprise Distribution is the most costly. You near a legitimate corporation with legal filing, corporate DUNS number to prove you have a financial record as a corporation, etc… It starts at a $300 payment and I'd guess months delay and legal/regulatory fees of $1500 in the US to be set up as an enterprise client of Apple.\n\n\n\nNow, you can mix apps of all 5 types above as long as your device is jailbroken. If your device is not jailbroken, you can mix the three Apple approved methods with web apps on the same device on an app by app basis.\nThe vast majority of people load apps through the app store, so all other methods are collectively called \"side-loading\". As you approach your work, think more about how the OS decides to install the app as opposed to how it's actually delivered. Once you get how code signing works, the delivery issues will work themselves out.\n\nA: The best way to register without introducing credit card details is trying to download a free app and when you'll be asked for user/pass word, just fill all the fields click the radio button of None on the payment method screen.\nFollow this steps, it's really easy!\n\nA: The answer is \"if you do not want to jailbreak an iPhone, the only way to get an app onto an iPhone is to publish it with Apple and there is a cost involved in doing that.\"\n", "Q: iPhone motherboard transplant I am in a bit of a pinch, as I just broke the digitizer ribbon cable when I was replacing the glass/LCD of a Sprint iPhone 4.\nI have a lot of iPhone 4's laying around, and I was wondering if I can replace the mother board. If I were to take the motherboard off of the phone that I broke the digitizer to, and installed it in another Sprint iPhone 4, would there be any issues?\nMy main concern is connecting to the cellular network and the persons data. Both of which is stored on the mother board, correct? (At least on a non AT&T iPhone 4)\n\nA: The answer seems to be yes. You can safely transplant the motherboard of a Sprint iPhone 4.\nAfter about 30 seconds from turning the device back on, it will connect to the service provider, and resume normal operations.\n", "Q: iPhoto 8 alternative I kind of like iPhoto 8, but it's unmantained, is there an alternative that:\n\n\n*\n\n*runs on 10.6\n\n*imports iPhoto library (events, albums, Facebook albums, hidden photos), and works more or less like iPhoto itself\n\n*is actively mantained\n\n*if it's not free, it offers an almost-fully working demo, i.e. limited in time but not in features (to be sure it actually works)\n\n*if it's not free, it has a reasonable price (i.e. 5~15€)\n\n\nMy problem with iPhoto itself is that the newer version requires 10.7, and the version I'm using has some very annoying bugs, such as every time I click on a Facebook album, it resets its privacy to \"friends only\".\n(likely such a software doesn't exist, but searching for such a topic brings up such a mess that I'm not sure, it might be well hidden)\nIf you know of a program which doesn't have all these features, but have most of them, feel free to list it anyway (no Picasa).\n\nA: Have you looked into Picasa? It has built in support for importing from iPhoto libraries. Release notes for v. 3.9 here.\nYou may not want to join the Google universe, though. Resistance is futile.\n", "Q: Solarized theme for Terminal I've installed the Solarized theme for Terminal.app and imported it. But my Terminal is all gray, I don't get color highlighting on anything. Not even running Python terminal generates any color. How can I get the color highlighting working properly?\n\n\nA: In the Solarized themes the bright green, yellow, blue, and cyan foreground colors seem to be almost the same as the default foreground color.\n\nOr if you were expecting it to add color to new places, it doesn't. Terminal setting files only change the settings that can also be changed from Terminal's preferences, like the values of ANSI colors.\n\nA: If you want coloured output from ls, look here https://github.com/seebi/dircolors-solarized\n", "Q: What is this menu bar icon with three right chevrons?

Is there any way to block a specific network? I also don't want it to show up or be usable in the Network Preferences.\n\nA: OS X and iOS all save known networks, so just forget that network and tell your computer to not ask to join networks.\nThe steps vary, but you should be able to open help from the Finder and search for \"Choose preferred Wi-Fi networks\" and it will guide you to the advanced settings for networking so you can delete any networks you don't want to join again. If you have many, you might delete them all and start fresh by only joining networks you intend to use for work purposes.\nIf you want to go a step further, delete the network password from your Keychain or change the password on the router and your mac won't re-join that network ever. \nEnjoy your break from the home network.\np.s. deleting this from terminal isn't something I know how to do, so sorry if you really wanted to learn how to script things, but this seems like something you could accomplish in 3 minutes or less without complicating things in terminal.\n", "Q: What does a 2012 Mac Mini need for microphone input? I need a simply jack Mic unamplified physically connected to my Mac Mini (late 2012 model) through Audio-IN and it doesn't work.\nI also tried the original iPhone's headphones to no avail and I wonder if this is normal?\n\nDoes the Mac Mini require a USB microphone or can I use the Audio Line-in port with another type of microphone?\nUPDATE 10/14: I tried using a 3 channel splitter like this\n\nthen I plugged my speakers and my earphones with mic but nothing to do, mic still doesn't work... (maybe just because this splitter has a 3 channel male jack but it's a normal 2 ch; I bought it for 2€ from China so it's possible..)\n\nA: The audio-in port on Mac Minis is a line-level port, meaning that a standard PC microphone may not be audible without some sort of amplifier.\nOn any Mini from 2010 and later, you can use the Apple headset (the kind that comes with the iPhone), but you have to plug it into the headphone port, not the audio-in port. There are also adapters available that allow you to use any standard PC headset with that port.\nOn older Minis, you'll have to use a USB audio adapter. The iMic is a popular one, but there are many others out there.\n\nA: My Mini is mid-2011.\nIn System Preferences->Sound if offers:\nOutput:\n- Internal Speakers\nInput:\n- Line-in\nI tried to use a simple Logitech headset (which I use on my PC) with the adapter, but it didn't work - simply nothing happens when I plug it in, Preferences stay the same, and no sound is heard.\nToday I tried different headset, the one that came with LG G4 smartphone. And it works. As soon as I plug it in, the System Preferences->Sound changes.\nSystem Preferences->Sound now shows:\nOutput:\n- Headphones\nInput:\n- External Microphone\n- Line-in\nWhen I select External Microphone, it records nicely. \nSo, it depends very much on the headset.\n\nA: had the same issue with my late 2012 mac mini today, found the adaptor that i discarded for my pc gaming headset and plugged it into the line out socket, now works perfectly in Skype, teamspeak etc\n\nA: Get a USB Stereo Sound adapter  $8 problem solved\n", "Q: Reformatting MacBookPro6,2 I have a macbook pro 6,2 and don't have the recovery discs as I am traveling abroad and left my discs at home. Is there any way to reformat my hard drive and get it to factory (or near factory) settings without the discs?\nDoes my computer have a recovery partition and can I use that to reformat?\n\nA: All Lion and later (10.7) OS X should have a recovery HD by default.\nIf you haven't changed your configuration, it likely does still have the recovery partition.  Find out by holding Option while booting. Now, the recovery HD only has disk formatting tools and terminal and the ability to connect to the App Store to re-download the installer. It doesn't actually save the installer to the drive.\nBarring that, I would download the Mac OS from the App Store and put it on a thumb drive for a reinstall.\n", "Q: How to focus on MacVim in terminal using keyboard shortcut? I have three Applications open, one window for each:\nGoogle chrome\nMacVim in server mode\niTerm2\nHow I can set up some keyboard shortcuts to focus this apps ?\nOne Idea is do it via Alfred 2 Powerpack, after double click ctrl, run the iTerm2 command, this will start the iTerm2 app when not running, or focus it when it is already open.\nSame for Google Chrome with different shortcut.\nBut I have no idea how to focus MacVim, because the app alone will run always a new window (no --remote option) when run like the both above.\nIs there a method to focus to an existing already open application ?\n\nA: See this question for different ways to assign shortcuts to opening applications.\nWhen I tried using Alfred to assign a keyboard shortcut for MacVim, pressing the shortcut did not always open a new window. You could try using a script like this though:\ntell application \"MacVim\"\n    reopen -- open a new default window if there are no open windows\n    activate -- make frontmost\nend tell\n\nOr try just using activate app \"MacVim\" or adding different arguments to open -a MacVim.\n", "Q: What kind of \"messages\" does Activity Monitor track with the \"Messages Sent\" and \"Messages Received\" columns? In Activity Monitor on OS X, it is possible to add additional columns to the process list view.  Two columns available in that list are \"Messages Sent\" and \"Messages Received\", which show up as \"Sent Msgs\" and \"Rcvd Msgs\", respectively.  Witness:\n\nWhat kind of \"messages\" is Activity Monitor referring to?\nWhen I saw \"message\", I thought at first of Objective-C \"messages\" that are dispatched with objc_msgSend(), but I can't see how those would be tracked by the operating system since most of those messages would be internal to the process itself. A debugger might track those kinds of messages when attached, but I can't see the OS doing it all the time — very high overhead.\nSo I am guessing those are heavier-weight messages. Are they a form of RPC between processes?  Or, are those messages calls from user-land into the kernel?  Seeking definitive references.  Thank you.\n\nA: Those numbers match the Mach messages in/out counts, so you seem to be correct in not interpreting them as the objc_msgSend counts. \nYou can learn more about higher level message counts by firing up Instruments (part of the freely downloadable Xcode toolset) and digging into a specific application to see what messages are being sent and when.\n\nIt can filter all allocations as well as allocations relating to ObjC and you can dig into much lower level details than just message send counts. The canonical documentation that is part of Xcode will help you make sense of these statistics and how they relate to Activity Monitor.\nSpecifically, search for NSObjCMessageLoggingEnabled and objc_msgSend in the Mac OS X Debugging Magic - Tools Guide portion of the Reference Documentation to get at the objC counts. \nSearch for mach message in Xcode and look for the IPC/Message Queues section of the Kernel Programming Guide for mach message queue details and what makes them up. They are much lower level IPC kernel traffic as you have surmised.\nYou probably can find it on developer.apple.com as well, but having the documentation local from within Xcode has many advantages.\n", "Q: Transferring text messages with upgrade from iPhone 4 to iPhone 5 My text messages did not transfer. Is there a way to get them yet? They are still on the old phone.\n\nA: I would get a program like PhoneView and just archive both device's SMS/Voicemail/call records. Unless the new phone is really new and you don't mind losing the new texts to restore a backup of all the texts from the old, there's not a way to inject or combine both stores of text messages.\n\nA: You have to first back up the old iphone 4, then restore the new iphone 5 to this backup, which contains your messages.To prevent from losing any data that only exist on your new iphone 5 but not on the old one, you should save these data before you do the backup and restore, because this will revert all settings and datas.\n", "Q: Fusion Drive: free space on SSD Is there a possibility to find out how much storage is free on a SSD of a Fusion Drive disk (SSD + HDD as a logical device)?

That space is used for incoming writes. If there's less than 4 GB of empty space on the SSD, Core Storage will start offloading data to the HDD.\nSo if all your data is less than your SSD capacity less 4 GB, then you have whatever your SSD capacity is (128 GB on all Apple supplied Fusion drives) minus the amount of your data. Otherwise, you've got 4 GB free.\nAs an aside, the reason df doesn't work in this case is that it only reads filesystems. The filesystem sits atop the logical volume created by Core Storage (the software behind Fusion) — there's no \"SSD portion\" or \"HDD portion\", to the filesystem it's all one big drive.\n", "Q: How to edit 'iTunes Movie' to be visible on iPhone's iMovie Videos that I've shot with my iPhone and are in my videos folder show up just fine on iMovie for iPhone as \"addable media\".\nBUT I recently had a professionally designed short \"intro\" video for my videos that I want to use as a lead-in to my iMovie for iPhone projects. And that intro video does NOT show up my videos folder on iPhone when I transfer it into my iPhone.\nInstead, that intro video seems to be somehow classified as a \"movie\" in iTunes on the iPhone, which can't be imported into iMovie. Any fixes here? A way to somehow get that intro video into the videos folder on the iPhone, or be able to add media from my iTunes movie folder into iMovie for iPhone?\n\nA: Yes. You will need to use iTunes to sync the intro video over to your iPhone.\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect your iPhone to iTunes and select it.\n\n*Click the \"Apps\" tab, and scroll down to \"File Sharing\".\n\n*Select iMovie from the list.\n\n*Select \"Add...\" from the lower right corner.\n\n*Browse your documents to find the intro video and open it.\n\n*Sync it over to your iPhone.\n\n*iMovie should recognize is as soon as the sync is completed and you should be able to use it normally.\n\n\nA: I had success using a different approach.  I used the Sync Photos function in iTunes to transfer the video file from my PC to my iPhone Photo library.

(Have lurked their site but I've been unable to find such).\nFor context, this question comes from https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/90459/identifying-a-lost-stolen-ipad-without-connecting-it-to-a-computer-or-downloadin?noredirect=1#comment106184_90459 - from the comments it seems like getting the serial number would be the most appropiate way to identify my lost iPad, since I have certain complications using the UDID to check that.\n\nA: I found one way.\nI am an iOS developer, and I once used this iPad for development. Xcode has an Organizer window, which keeps tracks of the devices I used for development. The iPad appears on the list, and it also displays the serial number.\nThis of course only works if you have developed with the device using Xcode. I wonder if there is a more standard way to get the serial number.\n", "Q: syncing songs from iPhone 4s to Mac I've brought a load of music on my iPhone and have now just purchased a MacBook pro.

I've read a lot of other questions about speed, but my question does not seem to be answered anywhere.  My Mac Mini is running so slow that I cannot see what I am typing. It takes up to 15 seconds to see the text I just wrote. Any process on the computer runs so slow that I see the spinning beachball all the time. \nI've looked in the Console and Activity Monitor, and cannot figure out what is wrong. No single process is taking up more than about 10% of the processor and memory is not maxed out.\nI should note this is not a very old computer.

This happened to me, as well. I emailed DropBox and they said it is normal during File-Sync. I went into DropBox Settings in the MenuBar and UnChecked All the Folders, so that the Files don't have to be on my Local Computer AFTER they have been Uploaded to DropBox.com (So, they were only needed locally to initially upload to DB without uploading via the website/browser. This is helpful if you have many Folders and Files inside other Folders.)

It came with OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard) but I upgraded to 10.8 (Mountain Lion).\nA few days ago, I tried to backup my files on an external hard drive, like I have successfully done many times before and after the OS upgrade.\nThe status on the Time Machine menu at the top of my screen said \"Preparing Backup\", instead of counting up like it usually does. It stayed that way for a few minutes, then I got tired of waiting and stopped the backup.\nLast night, I tried it again and let it sit overnight for almost 12 hours. It is still stuck on \"Preparing Backup\". What can I do to make the backup work like it did before?\nI tried Googling for this problem and the solutions I saw said to either wait longer (without any clear idea of how long) or to exclude the Backups.backupdb folder from my virus scanner (which doesn't apply to me since I don't have a virus scanner).\nEdit on 2013-5-23: Here are all the things I tried that didn't work:\n\n\n*\n\n*I tried waiting for the indexing to finish but that didn't seem to help. I let my laptop sit for about 36 hours and the status still said \"Preparing Backup\".\n\n*I found a folder on my backup drive named /Volumes/Time Machine Backups/Backups.backupdb/Elias Zamaria’s MacBook Pro (2)/2013-04-30-182726.inProgress. I deleted it and that didn't seem to help.\n\n*I tried verifying my main hard drive using the Disk Utility and everything seemed fine. I tried verifying the disk permissions and got some errors involving iTunes (I think), and I fixed them by clicking the \"Repair Disk Permissions\" button. I also tried verifying my external hard drive and it seemed fine. I tried the backup again and it froze like before.\n\n*I tried looking at the website that @lgsancho linked to. I found some things that may look useful but I didn't try them yet.\n\n*I tried running tmutil status, without the backup running and got this result:\nBackup session status:\n{\n    ClientID = \"com.apple.backupd\";\n    Running = 0;\n}\n\nI started the backup, waited for the status to change to \"Preparing Backup\", and ran the same command, and got this result:\nBackup session status:\n{\n    BackupPhase = ThinningPreBackup;\n    ClientID = \"com.apple.backupd\";\n    DateOfStateChange = \"2013-05-21 19:09:06 +0000\";\n    DestinationID = \"8BC5795A-0AAC-4976-B960-ECCE8F48842C\";\n    DestinationMountPoint = \"/Volumes/Time Machine Backups\";\n    Percent = \"-1\";\n    Running = 1;\n    Stopping = 0;\n}\n\nThe backup has been going on for about 45 minutes.

You could also try backing up to a new drive to make sure it's not a problem with the Mac as opposed to a problem with the backup drive or just a lot of changes to reconcile. \nSee this other answer for details.\nhttps://apple.stackexchange.com/a/65801/5472\nIn cases where you run into this repeatedly, you can either try to isolate what folder takes so long to back up. On a first backup, I've tried to exclude the Users folder (or several folders at the base of the boot volume if they have more than 10 GB of data) to make sure that the filseystem is OK and the backup drive is OK. At that point, you will see backups taking a minute or so for each incremental backup. You can then relax the exclusion list and know if it freezes, then you have a problem in a specific folder.\nThe other way to attack this is run disk utility (or another tool) to repair the directory structure or make a back up using another tool and wipe the drives / restore them from backup.\n\nA: Successively run: \ntmutil status\n\nAnd look at NumberOfChangeItems:\n$ tmutil status\nBackup session status:\n{\nBackupPhase = ThinningPreBackup;\nClientID = \"com.apple.backupd\";\nDateOfStateChange = \"2014-12-14 16:32:00 +0000\";\nDestinationID = \"25933E19-B889-4FAF-B421-53AFE4C68B58\";\nDestinationMountPoint = \"/Volumes/Time Machine Backups\";\nNumberOfChangedItems = 92229;\nPercent = 0;\nRunning = 1;\nStopping = 0;\n}\n\n$ tmutil status\nBackup session status:\n{\nBackupPhase = ThinningPreBackup;\nClientID = \"com.apple.backupd\";\nDateOfStateChange = \"2014-12-14 16:32:00 +0000\";\nDestinationID = \"25933E19-B889-4FAF-B421-53AFE4C68B58\";\nDestinationMountPoint = \"/Volumes/Time Machine Backups\";\nNumberOfChangedItems = 349457;\nPercent = 0;\nRunning = 1;\nStopping = 0;\n}\n\nAs long as the number is moving you are making progress.\n\nA: I just rebooted my laptop and started the backup. It worked fine.\nI have no idea why this works but at least I have some idea what to try if I have this problem again.\n\nA: Same problem encountered by me as mentioned by OP.\nHowever, after performing the following steps, it worked like a charm:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open your Time Machine drive in the Finder, select and delete the .inProgress file:\n\n(enter your username and password, or an administrator's username and password, if asked to do so) and reboot your Mac, as mentioned in this video.\n\n\n*Before connecting your external HDD for backup, open Terminal\nand execute the following code:\nsudo mdutil -a -i off\n\nto disable Spotlight, as mentioned in this answer.\n\n\n*Connect your external HDD to your computer and start the\nbackup.\n\nNow please, be patient, give it around 30 minutes.\nEven now if the backup is still stuck in \"Preparing backup\" then:\n\nExecute the second line of code given in the above linked answer (that is,\nenable Spotlight again):\nsudo mdutil -a -i on\n\nwhile \"Preparing for backup\" is still running.\n\nIn my case, I waited for 45 minutes after following the above steps, and then finally my Mac started its backup.\n\nA: I'm pretty sure it helps to delete an old backup. I struggled around with the same problem and solved it by deleting the oldest backup. See here how to do that.\n\nA: A very useful page about Time Machine: http://pondini.org/OSX/Home.html\n\nA: This might not be the reason why OP had the issue, but since this question appears high in the search result, I have another possible cause: the Disk Activity monitor of MenuMeters polls the disk too often and completely blocks TM.\nSimply disabling that monitor (while keeping the CPU, memory and network monitors) fixes the problem.\n\nA: I had this same issue and found a solution below.. hope this helps others.\nFor me, it was stuck on “preparing to restore…” for 5+ hours, seemed strange so I gave up this method and tried another route…\nThe problem, I realized now, was that my time machine backup was from macOS Catalina version, but when I booted in recovery mode, my Mac automatically downloaded the latest OS version (Monterey at the moment).\nThe solution: I installed Catalina on a bootable drive (download from App Store), and then I booted/installed from USB… once you go through that flow there will be an option to restore from time machine, and then the restore will work \n\nA: I think this is a normal issue.

So I end up having messages in my Inbox instead of in the appropriate Mail folder. Why?\n\nA: The mailbox rules on the iMac are only executed when Mail runs on the Mac. Thus to see the effect of the rule on the iPhone you have to have loaded the email on the Mac first.\nTo get the rules to work for all clients you need to implement then on the server. For most servers this means using the web version of the mail and logging on to the server there and then implementing the rules there.

I would like to transfer a bunch of photos onto my iPad without syncing through iTunes.\nI had the idea of using a USB flash drive and the Camera Connection Kit, but simply dumping the pictures into the root directory of the drive doesn't work; the iPad says that there are no photos.\nIs there any way to do this?\n\nA: This can be done by imitating the folder structure of a camera's memory card.\nFirst, find a flash drive that's compatible with the Camera Connection Kit (i.e. doesn't draw more than 100 mA). \nCreate a directory in the root of the USB drive named DCIM. Inside DCIM create a directory that has exactly 8 characters. Put your picture/video files inside this directory, ensuring that they have an 8.3 pattern filename (e.g. somepics.jpg). \nYou'll end up with a directory structure that looks like this:\n\nUSB drive root\n  -\\DCIM\n    -\\FAKECAM1\n      -\\pict0001.jpg\n      -\\pict0002.jpg\n...\n\n\nA: Connect the ipad usb cord to your Ipad and  computer, get a flash drive, connect as well to your computer.

There is a pixel in the middle of the screen that has the opposite color of what it should have:\n\n\n*\n\n*If background is white, pixel is black\n\n*If background is black, pixel is white\n\n\nSo it's not technically a dead pixel, but similar. (just more annoying because it see it on black backgrounds...)\nHow can I diagnose if this is a software or hardware problem ? Are there any standard test that I can run ?\n\nA: Dead pixels aren't necessarily \"black pixels\". Although it's common that the dead pixel stays black, they also come in different colors and, as in your case, they can change colors too.\nThe way to tell if it's a software problem is to check if the pixel appears dead right after turning on the machine. If that is the case, it must be a hardware problem because the software has not been loaded yet at this point.\nCheck this, and if it's a hardware problem, my guess is a failing graphics card or display.

I have three or four folder actions set up which stopped working some time ago, and I can't figure out why.\nThinking it could be a problem with the scripts, I created a new folder named \"Test\" on my desktop, and attached the \"add - new item alert.scpt\" sample script. When I created a new text file in the folder, nothing happened. I checked the system log to see if there were any error messages being output, but I couldn't find any. (In fact, searching the system log using Console.app for \"folder\" didn't produce any results at all)\nHow do I figure out why none of my folder actions are working?\n\nA: Folder Actions seem to have been buggy for a lot of people in Mountain Lion (myself included). There’s discussion elsewhere on Ask Different about the unreliability of Folder Actions in general, and there are quite a few threads on Apple’s support forums about the issue.\nReinstalling 10.8.4 seemed to fix the problem for the OP, but I’ll note here what seems to be a common fix. The following practice, quoted from Jehan Alvani’s blog, has been cited in quite a few places:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Create ~/Library/Scripts/Folder Action Scripts/ and drop the folder action script you want to add in there.\n  \n*Strangely, open System Preferences → Keyboard → Keyboard Shortcuts, and click the Reset to Defaults button.\n  \n*Scroll up to the Files & Folders section, and make sure that the Folder Actions Setup… listing is checked.\n  \n\nI think you want to go to the Services panel within the Keyboard preferences pane, but I’m not certain. I’m not willing to try it since I don’t want to reconfigure my keyboard shortcuts if I screw it up, and I don’t use Folder Actions anyway.\nI know the OP’s problem has been fixed, but this may be of use to other people facing similar difficulties.\n\nA: Deleting the workflow and reinstalling it will get things going again:\n\n*\n\n*Locate your .workflow file ~/Library/Workflows/Applications/Folder Actions/*.workflow\n\n\n*Move .workflow file to Desktop.\n\n\n*Delete the containing folder ~/Library/Workflows/Applications.\n\n\n*Move .workflow file from Desktop back into ~/Library/Workflows\n\n\n*Double click .workflow file to install.\n\n\n\n\nA: I wanted to reiterate the solutions from Alex and others are excellent. This process fixed folder actions automatic processing, without needing a manual trigger.\n1.Scroll up to the Files & Folders section, and make sure that the Folder Actions Setup… listing is checked.\n2. Deleting the workflow and reinstalling it will get things going again\nAfter this, my folder context manual show the option 'Folder Acton Set up', the 'folder action' can then be assigned\nHave to say, Apple's guide/help/documentation on this topic is very bad. The interface design is also terrible, after assigning the \"folder action\" in context manual, there is no 'confirm/submit' button, very weird without more help like here to figure things out.\n\nA: In Yosemite I often have to restart the Mac to make the folder actions run. Especially if I've created a folder action > then removed it > corrected the script > readded the folder action.\nBut folder actions sometimes do some naughty things. Example: Adding a name to a file > will keep readding this name until file name limit has been reached. The action will have to move the file out of the folder to make it work.\n", "Q: Dock/Expose not working, Desktop stuck with gray background (Lion) I am running Mac OS X 10.7.5 and the Dock/Mission Control/Desktop functionality is totally broken.

My desktop is working but the background is permanently stuck on Gray no matter what I change it to.\nkillall Dock reports that there are no matching processes that belong to me.  I have removed the plist and db files for Dock and Desktop (com.apple.{whatever}.plist) in the Preferences folder and rebooted multiple times (both Safe Mode and regular) and nothing will change.  Does anyone know what might be wrong? Looking for a solution short of a full reinstall.\n\nA: I had a similar issue, and running killall -KILL Dock in terminal worked for me.\n\nA: Luckily the computer was on 10.7 Lion so I had room to upgrade to 10.8 Mountain Lion which overwrote the corrupted Dock/Expose applications in the upgrade process.  My advice to anyone with a similar problem would be to upgrade OS X if possible or reinstall the current operating system if not (no need to delete user data).\n", "Q: Is there a way to make some application have different resolution on a Retina Macbook Pro? I use \"Best for Retina display\" in my settings. It's suitable for my eyes:)\nBut I'd like to get more spaces in some applications by using the highest resolution. So is there a way to do so?\n\nA: The OS doesn't have any sort of procedure to tell app A to use one screen size and app B another.\nUnless the apps you use have a preference to change layout, icon size or other aspects of layout and zoom (like a spreadsheet tool can zoom in and out regardless of the overall resolution), you'll have to pick the best resolution and then change it up as needed based on your workflow.\n", "Q: Unable to eject or erase USB drives I'm unable to eject USB drives. When I try, I get this error:\n\nThe disk \"Untitled\" wasn't ejected because one or more programs may\n  be using it.\nTo eject the disk immediately, click the Force Eject button.\n\nAdditionally, when I use Disk Utility to erase a USB drive I get this error:\n\nDisk Erase failed with the error:\nCouldn't unmount disk.\n\nThis happens on my account and my wife's account. I can partition USB drives, but I can't erase or eject them.\nAny ideas on how to resolve this?\n\nA: You can use lsof to list open files:\nsudo lsof|grep /Volumes/Volume\\ name\n\nIf you run lsof without sudo, it doesn't include processes owned by other users.\n\nA: When you have this kind of error, typically it occurs because the device is mounted and there is something accessing the information on the mounted disk. Whatever is causing you to be unable to eject the disk is the same reason the disk utility can't unmount the drive to erase it.\nLikely culprits for things still accessing your files include applications like Preview or possibly Dropbox if you use it to import the information. If the USB drives include songs, iTunes could possibly be accessing the information as well. You want to make sure that all of these types of apps are closed when you go to dismount.\n\nA: I had the same problem, found a hint for solution here:\nhttp://www.snowcrash.eu/disk-wasnt-ejected-because-one-or-more-programs-may-be-using-it/.\nIn my case the culprit was a small non-archived program file (an old crack from Mac OS 8 days) which somehow stayed open by an unknown process in the system.

Recently I have decided that since Mac does such a nice job for indexing the files, I will store many files on the Mac, so I bought a 6TB Thunderbolt external drive which is in RAID 0 Strip mode, and another 2 external drives that are 4TB each, and use them as the RAID 1 mirror mode.\nThe iMac is 1 year old, so it is still using USB 2.0, but the drive using Thunderbolt is fast.\nHowever, if I just right click an image on a website and choose \"Save Image As\", now I have to wait 30 seconds for the drives to \"wake up\", before the \"Save As\" will pop out the window to let me click the \"Save\" button at all to save the file.  Since some Mac can now boot up in 25 seconds, I need to wait a longer time than the boot up time just to save an image, which 99.99% of the time is by default just on the Mac's internal hard drive, under ~/Downloads.\nIs there a way to improve this?  I also turned off the \"Put the hard drive to sleep when possible\" in the System Preferences, but it is still doing the same thing.  For example, if the \"Save Image As\" can let me choose the \"Downloads\" folder, and just to wake the other drives up when I do select to look into them.\nOne method I can think of is, write a shell script that will ls /Volumes/WD6TB and ls /Volumes/WD4TB (the drives' names), just to wake the drives up whenever I start using this iMac.  Or else if there is a way to cause the screensaver to wake up the drives whenever there is a mouse move or keyboard action, wake the display (which it can do), and wake the hard drives, that will be a good solution too.\n\nA: The save button is checking all mounted drives, and will spin them up.  \nYour only way I can think of to do this is to prepare a couple of scripts.\nSee the man page for diskutil.  If the mount point (diskname) is BigFatDisk\nthen to unmount the disk it would be something like\ndiskutil unmount BigFatDisk\nNow to keep everything sync'd to BFD you would run a script now and then\ndiskutil mount BigFatDisk\nrsync flags local disk BFD\ndiskutil unmount BigFatDisk\nA second option is to replace the disks in the BFD enclosure with hybrid disks.  These have an SSD chunk and a spinning rust chunk, and are ideally suited for this.\nA third option is to let your disks spin whenever the machine is awake?  The amount of power they use is small, and increasingly MTBF times are being given as X spinups, not X hours.  A hard drive 2 years ago used 5-7 watts.  I'm sure it's better now.  So let's use 5.  That works out to 40 kWhr per year, roughly.  At 15 c per kWh that's 6 bucks/year.  Seems to me that this is pretty cheap compared to the hassles you have now.\nI have set my computer to turn the screens off after 20 minutes idle time, but never to turn off the CPU or spin the drives down.\n", "Q: Imessage delivery status When an imessage doesn't display delivered or not delivered beneath the message, will it update if and when the recipient is able to recieve iMessages again?\n\nA: If the message was delivered, whenever the recipient reads it, a Read [Date] will automatically be displayed beneath. Bear in mind, as Emil points out in the comments, that for this behaviour to happen, the receiver must have the Send Read Receipts option enabled. \nIf the message is marked as not delivered, it means that, for some reason, that message couldn't be sent.

If I plug it into a desktop PC, it works. What can be the problem? An USB hub would solve this issue, I suppose, but can I avoid buying one?\n\nA: I do not think it is a power problem.\nCheck in GarageBand if your device is showing up.\nIf not:\nI would start with getting the latest software for your MIDI device\n\n\nA: http://forums.rolandclan.com/viewtopic.php?f=54&t=45738\nOn my A49 you have to hold down the \"Function\" \"Pitch\" and \"Assign\" buttons on the keyboard all at the same time as you power it on.\n\nA: You will need to disenable the SIP control of the Mac OS.

This will bring up a new Finder window with the options to Search either in This Mac or in the current folder. Choose the name of the folder.\nYou'll be able to add new criteria to the search by pressing the Add (+) button on the right side of the search window. Clicking on the newly added criteria, a drop-down list will let you choose between the default ones. By choosing Other you'll be given a lot more options. Look for Spotlight Comments, and hit Ok.\nWhen using Spotlight you can search for files which do not match certain criteria by typing the operand NOT before the keyword. So, once you've configured your Search options, just typing NOT abc in the Spotlight comment criteria will do the trick.\n", "Q: save IPv4 address for different WIFI I have a macbook pro, that I use at work and in my house,\nthe problem is that i have to set up manually the TCP/IP IPv4 address for each place,\nthe address doesn't change once im on a location,\nbut I have to change it manually when I go to the office and when I get home,\nSo how can I save it so that when I connect a specific WIFI the IPv4 address will get configured specially for that place?\nThanks!\n\nA: I create a location for places like that.

There was a problem while trying to partition, so i booted into single user mode and ran the ffsck command. This returned an error, and after that, my mac stopped rebooting. I tried many things, from safe mode to repairing in disk utility, but nothing works. All im getting when i try to boot is a progress bar that stops when its about 1/9 done, and then the computer shuts down.\nWhat the hell happened?\nI have no back ups whatsoever...\nEDIT: is there a way i can somehow get the files off my hard disk using the same mac? I have no other computers.\n\nA: If the fsck modified the filesystem, it may have corrected damage to the file system by deleting a file needed to boot.\nIf you can get professional troubleshooting assistance, I would do that since without a backup, you'd hate to make the problem worse.\nTrying to fix a filesystem or writing new files to it will over-write space that could have files that you need to recover, so you'll want to shut down the computer and make a decision:\n\n\n*\n\n*Are you willing to proceed without trying to recover the files you need?\n\n*Is it better to get a quote for data-recovery and learn more about the problem than it is to try to fix this now.\n\n\nGood luck - I hate to be in this situation (either as the one giving advice or the one needing advice), but it's a problem that many have overcome, so you'll just need to figure out what's most important to you and be sure you understand what the consequences of doing a step might be. In your case, fsck isn't a good tool to run if you have precious data since it is designed to save a filesystem by making it sane after errors creep in. It's not designed to save individual files that have not been backed up.\n", "Q: Did the \"Gift This App\" option go away? I regularly gift apps to friends, but now I can't find the Gift button anywhere: Not in the sharing menu of the iPad's app store where it used to be, not under the disclosure arrow on the iTunes store under OSX. Did Apple deactivate the ability to gift apps?\nEdited to add: No really, the menu options just don't seem to be there anymore. This is what it looks like when in the Mac version of the iTunes store:\n\nAnd this is what I see in the iPad version of the app store:\n\nEither way, the gift option isn't where it used to be.\n\nA: It's there for me both in iTunes and the iOS App Store (on an iPhone, don't have my iPad handy to test). That's in the Canadian store, FWIW. Things can and do vary by country, and for that matter by what CDN node you're connected to, so it may be different for others. Best advice is to wait it out and try again in a little while, in case there was a glitch somewhere along the line.\n\n\nA: Seems like gifting an app only works for apps you haven't purchased yet. Comparing your screenshot with robmathers', yours has the Open button and his has the Buy button.\n", "Q: Given the strength and scratch resistance of Gorilla Glass, are cases of value for iPhones? Do I need a protective case for my iPhone 5?\nThis is my first smart phone. I thought one of the advantages of a modern smart phone was the Gorilla Glass and the small size and weight. It seems to me that cases add bulk and weight to the phone, so I find it odd that cases are so common.\nAny people out there with an iPhone without a protective case? What has your experience been. It is rare to see a raw iPhone on the streets. Sometimes I think this is just a) security theater (i.e. makes you '''feel''' like the phone is more safe) and b) a way to personalize the now ubiquitous device. \nThere's an article/video that talks about the efficacy of Gorilla Glass. The summary is it is quite good but that small particulate matter (sand) can scratch the glass. Typical things like coins & keys in the pockets should not scratch the screen.\nGiven that I feel the glass needs no protection, what value does a case offer?\n\nA: I have an iPhone 4S.  Like you, I originally thought that I ought to get a protective case for my iPhone.  I tried several cases, but none of them were satisfactory (too bulky, too cumbersome to open to get to the phone, too ugly).\nI now have no case for the phone, and I keep it in my trouser pocket all the time.  Instead of getting a case for the phone, though, I got a key case for my keys (which I keep in the same pocket) to prevent them scratching the glass!  That solution has worked well - the iPhone is now over a year old but looks as good as new, and I haven't added any size or weight to it.\n\nA: I can't with any degree of honesty tell you what's best for you, I can only share what I do and try to explain my reasoning.\nI am on my third iPhone (original, 4, and now 4S) and have used them uncased, in a bumper-style case(original) before settling on the OtterBox Defender, (original, and another for the 4/4s). \nI didn't do this because of fear of scratching. My original iPhone developed some patina during its years of use, including some minor scratches on the Gorilla Glass screen, but it wasn't so bad as to be bothersome. My real concern is dropping the phone. I have a fairly active lifestyle and the iPhone goes along for the ride. For example, I use it as a bike computer (and bicycle entertainment system), so it's clamped to the handlebars in a RAM mount and subjected to dust, moisture (short of downpour–I move it into a weatherproof pocket or bag in that event) and of course the potential of taking a tumble. I also use the phone while offroading and have on numerous occasions dropped the device to the ground from a lifted Land-Rover. (The seat belt loves to strip the phone out of the belt clip as I exit the truck. I pocket carry more often now, but my original and the 4 both hit the pavement more than once.)\nI don't mind scratches per say (I like tools that look like they're used)but when I moved to the 4s I sold my 4 to cover most of the cost. The protection afforded by the case is a big plus on this count. (Note that I dislike the screen protector offered by the OtterBox and have removed it from the case, so my screen is \"naked\", though I could use a stick-on screen protector if I chose to do so.)\nThat being said, I'm allowed a subsidized replacement (5s?) in October and am rethinking the cumbersome case—it makes the sleek iPhone a little too phablety for my taste and I suspect the slimmer 5 model will sit comfortably in most of my pockets. I will get (may even have) a belt case for the times when I need to go Batman (I'll make sure it has a belt loop, not a clip, so it stays on when I jump out of the truck). The bike mount can be replaced with a stem bag that has a smart phone window on top. It remains to be seen as to whether or not I install a bumper style case or just go naked. That will probably be based on how slippery I find the phone to be. Despite the (alleged) trend preferring bigger phones, I'd like to reduce the bulk and mass of my EDC load out. \nIn a related note, I completely agree with David Campbell—keys, multi tools and pocket change are the scourge of the screen (and the phone case too, but those scratches are an aesthetic concern, not a potential functional problem). You want to keep these metal objects isolated somehow if you opt for naked pocket carry. \n\nA: The iPhone 4S has glass on both sides, the glass is very slippery.\nThe primary reason for having a case on my phone is so I don't drop it when I remove it from my pocket.\n", "Q: Is it possible to hack facetime call? Me and my girlfriend are using facetime regularly for talking. I'm worried if anyone can hack our Facetime calls and record our videos? Is it possible? How safe is Facetime?\n\nA: FaceTime is quite secure. In Feb 2014, Apple published a white paper on the security used in various iOS services, which finally brought to light some of the features that others had previously inferred or guessed at. The section for FaceTime states:\n\nFaceTime is Apple’s video and audio calling service. Similar to iMessage, FaceTime calls also use the Apple Push Notification Service to establish an initial connection to the user’s registered devices. The audio/video contents of FaceTime calls are protected by end-to-end encryption, so no one but the sender and receiver can access them. Apple cannot decrypt the data.\nFaceTime uses Internet Connectivity Establishment (ICE) to establish a peer-to-peer connection between devices. Using Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) messages, the devices verify their identity certificates and establish a shared secret for each session. The nonces supplied by each device are combined to salt keys for each of the media channels, which are streamed via Secure Real Time Protocol (SRTP) using AES-256 encryption.\n\n\nA: FaceTime calls are encrypted sufficiently for most anyone's needs. FaceTime's encrypted stream acts underneath any other WiFi encryption that might also be present. If you feel that end-to-end data streams encrypted with unique keys for each recipient is safe, then I'd say have fun with FaceTime.\nSomeone with special skills, tools and time could probably crack it, but you probably don't have a high enough profile to be worth the time/effort.\n\nA: As far as I have read, you should assume your Facetime traffic is completely unencrypted. There have been assertions by Apple of encryption (the ZDNet article linked above), but they talked about using WPA2. WPA2 has nothing to do with encrypting the voice/video traffic. WPA2 is about making wireless connections to an access point private. Your Facetime traffic is sent to the AP, then to your router, then to your ISP's router then all over the place before it gets to your gf's home network or cellular provider/device. I should note that I have not done a protocol analysis of the Facetime protocol; I'm going by the published statements.\nSaying that WPA2 answers the question is like being confident in transporting large sums of money to the bank using an armored truck only between the loading dock and the edge of the parking lot and then putting the money into a Corolla and driving it the rest of the way to its destination.\n", "Q: how to get Finder to automatically open a Finder window / or always keep one open? Let's say I have all my Finder windows closed. I'm in an application, like let's say Google Chrome. I ⌘-tab to the Finder icon to switch to Finder. But it shows me nothing... no windows, because I have no windows open. I have to then invoke ⌘-N to open a Finder window. \nIs there a way to get OSX to automatically open a Finder window when I ⌘-tab to the Finder icon to switch to Finder, since anytime I switch to Finder, I always want a window? \n\nA: \nYou can already open a new window if one is not already open by pressing the \n\nCOMMAND-TAB and hold down COMMAND. \nRelease TAB, keep holding down COMMAND, \nthen press OPTION and hold it down. \nWhile still holding down OPTION, release COMMAND. Then release OPTION.\nAs far as doing it automatically you'd probably have to script something. \nSource: @l'L'l\n\nA: There is a distinction (in AppleScript terms) between reopening and activating an application.\n\n\n*\n\n*For example clicking a Dock icon reopens an application: if there are no visible windows, it opens a new default window, or if all windows are minimized, it unminimizes one of them.\n\n*The application switcher activates applications by default, but if you hold option before releasing command, it reopens the selected application.\n\n*Opening an application from the Spotlight menu, Finder, or Alfred reopens it.\n\n\nWitch has an option to tell applications with no windows to reopen:\n\nOr if for example you use Alfred to assign shortcuts to opening applications, the shortcuts always reopen applications.\n", "Q: Have Apple ceased selling Mac Pros in the UK? I thought I'd look into the specs and price of a modern Mac Pro here in the UK, but there's no mention of them on the official Apple website.

There's an app in my Mac App Store update list called \"Mahjong Deluxe Free\". I have never downloaded this app, let alone play mahjong (is that normal?).\nUpon trying to clear it from the list by updating it, I am presented with the following:\n\nThe Apple ID entered is not mine, and I have never heard of it. No one else in my house uses my laptop, and I don't know anybody that still uses Hotmail.\nI figured I would try clearing it by finding the app and downloading it with my own Apple ID, but the following:\n\nI click OK, and it presents me with a final error, saying:\n\nWe could not complete your request.\nThere was an error in the App Store. Please try again later. (4)\n\nAny ideas on what to do?\n\nA: This is caused by a Mac AppStore Receipt residing somewhere on your system that was issued for different account. Spotlight is generally of no use in finding these, since it can't go deep enough to find them within the places they are. Usually the offending receipt can be located with a simple command, that may have to be adjusted according to your file system structure. \nOpen Terminal and try:\ncd /\n\nthen\nfind . -type f -name \"receipt\" -exec grep -s -R -n -i \"com.ensenasoft\" {} \\;\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Press Control - C to cancel/stop\n\n\nif located you will should see something such as:\nBinary file Applications/Mahjong Deluxe Free.app/Contents/_MASReceipt/receipt matches\n\nIf it failed to locate anything you will need to adjust the path, for example to search a different volume:\ncd /Volumes/<Name of Volume>\n\nthen try the command again.\n", "Q: Connect to OSX via AFP over WAN with a Time Capsule on network? I have a Time Capsule set up on my LAN to handle backups between my mom's computer and my computer.\nBefore we had the Time Capsule, I could connect remotely to a MacBook Pro that I set up as a server through the AFP protocol easily. Instead of having to worry about using the right IP, I used No-IP Dynamic Updater to assign me a DNS name that I can remember.\nSince the Time Capsule was installed, however, I can no longer AFP into my mac. Instead, running the following command (hostname hidden):\nafp://****\n\nWill allow me to use AFP with the Time Capsule, and allows me to log in from there and view the storage disk on the capsule.\nIs there someway to connect to my mac from outside my LAN, but specify what device I want to connect to inside my LAN? Something like:\nafp://****:10.0.1.100\n\nWhere 10.0.1.100 is the LAN address of my MBP server?\n\nA: You could forward port 548 to your MBP server to get back the old behavior of allowing afp://**** to connect to your MBP server instead of your Time Capsule.  This would definitely make your Time Capsule AFP server inaccessible from the Internet and might (but I would hope not) make it inaccessible from your LAN.  Try it and see.  Here is one of many web pages describing how to set up port forwarding. \nYou can pick any public port you want > 1024.  I'll pick 9898 for this example.  Following the instructions on the linked page, in step 4 set up port forwarding like this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Description: AFP access to MBP\n\n*Public UDP Ports: 9898\n\n*Public TCP Ports 9898\n\n*Private IP Address: the LAN address of your server, e.g. 10.0.1.100\n\n*Private UDP Ports: 548\n\n*Private TCP Ports: 548\n\n\nThen you can access your server from the internet using afp://hostname:9898\n\nA: Pick a random port from the outside world, forward UDP and TCP to port 548 of one device with an internal LAN IP.  Pick another port for a second device, rinse and repeat.\nForward 9898 to 548 of a Time Capsule, forward 9998 to 548 of a MacBook Pro, etc. For Charlies question, afp://my.no-ip.address:9898 will reach the TC, afp://my.no-ip.address:9998 will reach the MBP.\n", "Q: OSX won't boot after re-install Got the flashing folder of death.\nTried verifying, repairing the disk.

How can OSX install on a drive BUT then fail to boot from it?\n(I could understand if the drive was failing, but this makes no sense)\nI can replace the drive but that seems silly and might not be the issue in the first place.\n\nA: Sounds like the partitioning is damaged.  If you can boot from OS X on an external drive, use Disk Utility to \"Repair Disk\".  If that reports OK, the Repair the partition with the OS X installation.  \nThe particular kind of Mac might be helpful, and the OS versions.  \nAlso, for Intel Macs, the disk must be partitioned with GUID.

But it becomes strange when I shut down the Mac, because when the machine is OFF, the fan runs riot.\nThis is how I shut it down:\nI select the apple-symbol in the menu bar and click on \"Shut Down…\". After that I get a popup-window that tells me that without any further action the Mac would be shut down in 60 seconds (counting down). This window contains a checkbox where I can choose if I want to get all windows reopened after the next start (I don't want). I click on the right button that says \"Shut Down\". Then the screen turns black, and if I listen carefully I can hear some quiet noise form the harddisk, and after that I would expect that the machine would be completely off and emmits neither any light nor any noise.\nThis is true for light but not for noise. In exactly that moment when I would expect the end of all activities, the fan starts to run at highest possible speed. I didn't even know that it can run so fast and blow out so much air. But it does. And it wont stop. Even if I wait more than half an hour the fan keeps running at highest speed. And the Mac is NOT hot! When I touch it, it feels as cold as any other peace of metal that has room temperature.\nThe fan stops only in this two cases:\n\n\n*\n\n*I physically disconnect the power cable. After doing so, I can wait as long as I want (I tried 8 hours during night). In the very moment when I reconnect the power supply, the fan instantly starts running at top speed and won't stop again (I lost patience after 20 minutes and then I pulled out the plug again).\n\n*I press the on/off-button on the back of the lower left corner of the Mac. In this case the fan stops on the spot and the startup-procedure beginns and everything is fine.\nThe fan also goes mad after long time in sleep-mode:\nWhen I do normal work on my Mac (writing text, browsing in internet) I can hear the fan at a very low level. It is so quiet that I really must concentrate to hear it. When it is in sleep mode I don't even hear this low noise. I think the fan is stoped completely in this mode. But when the sleep-mode is lasting too long the fan jumps into high-speed mode too. I noticed this today morning. Yesterday evening I set the iMac in sleep mode by pressing the on/off-button on the back of the lower left corner. Then I was watching TV for aprox. 2 hours and then i left the room and went to bed. Fan was quiet at this moment. When I came back in the morning I found the mac with the fan running on highest possible speed.\nThis happened before:\nThe day before yesterday I bought a new usb-hub. When the Mac was in sleep mode I connected the hub's UBS-cable to the mac and then connected the hub's power supply to the outlet next to the one where the mac gets its power from. Then I turned on the Mac and everything was fine. I worked some time on it (I guess 1 hour) then I pressed the on/off-button to send it to sleep, but this time it was different:\nThe screen turned black as expected, but the mouse-pointer was still visible for aprox. 5 or 10 seconds. I didn't try to move the mouse in this moment, so I don't know if it would have reacted on mousemovement. Then also the mouse-pointer disappeared and everything was as expected. Then I was away for some hours and when I came back I tried to turn on the iMac by pressing the on/off-Button. But nothing happened. I tried pressing the button for a long time (1 min) and tried to press it fast in rapid succession but nothing happened. My iMac stayed off. So I pulled out the power plug, did wait for aprox. 1 minute and reconnected it (at this time nothing happened, also the fan didn't start). When I tried to press the on/off-button this time it did work. My iMac did start and worked fine. But since this episode the fan gets crasy when the machine is shut down.

On iOS, the battery keeps time and on Macs, the SMC is responsible for knowing when the power button is pressed and if the Mac should start itself up due to a scheduled wake or power on being saved in the NVRAM.\nIf you called for service, Apple would likely focus on several things:\n\n\n*\n\n*Have you checked that the firmware and software is up to date.\n\n*Does this happen every single time, or is it an occasional thing.\n\n*Have you disconnected everything (including the mouse and keyboard) and tested to see if it's in any way related to a peripheral.\n\n\nAssuming you can reproduce this at will (it happens every time), you would probably take steps to reset the SMC to ensure it's getting proper readings from the temperature sensors.\n\n\n*\n\n*Intel-based Macs: Resetting the System Management Controller (SMC)\nIf after spending the 10 minutes it would take to read through each and every step (I feel it's important to perform the steps in order - even if they seem unrelated or unnecessary), I would expect them to want to run diagnostics to physically open the Mac to check the sensors and wiring. Your symptoms sure sounds like the SMC either is stuck in some loop and not reading the temp sensors. Failure to control the fans properly could also be a hardware issue where the SMC is receiving a signal where the correct action is to keep the fans not only spinning, but spinning at an elevated level.\n\nA: You can try a PRAM reset if you haven't already.  It would also be useful to check the output of your temperature sensors using something like iStats.  If those don't help then there's a good chance your motherboard is bad.\nMake very sure you are backing up to an external disk and have another system available for the day when this one no longer boots.\n", "Q: Networking an external hard drive I want to buy a Seagate Backup Plus Desktop 4TB Thunderbolt drive, but I was wondering if it is possible to connect my external hard drive to a network. There are two options which might help:\n\n\n*\n\n*we have a server, is it possible that I connect my external hard drive through my own macbook to the server that others could have access to it?\n\n*I might be able to construct a network and give access to the other computers to store their data on my external hard drive.\n\nA: Many modern routers offer the ability to connect a hard disk directly to the router and make it visible on the network.  That might be another option to explore.\n\nA: Since OS X can share files like a server, most people just turn on File Sharing when their Mac has files it needs to share and then plug the drive into the server for when the Mac is away from the network.\n", "Q: iMac monitor leaves watermark-like window stamps after a while I'm not sure how to compile a logic title for this question, so if the title is unclear, suggest an edit. Here's a description of the problem I am experiencing:\nWhenever my iMac has been on for a few hours the silhouette of the window that has been open for a while is imprinted in the screen. Moving around the window does not help, only when I turn off the monitor and let it cool down for a while the imprint is gone.\nBesides a window's silhouette it also seems to imprint directory folder trees, macro, and/or icons sometimes.\nI do use a screen saver, however as a developer I sometimes actively work in one window for a few hours.\nSince the iMac is 'only' three years old and I haven't had this until last week, I am wondering if anybody has experienced the same issue, before taking it in a repair shop.\nKind regards\n\nA: The proper jargon seems to be a burn in. This extensive post at the apple forums holds a lot of answers.\n\nA: LCD displays have short and long term effects due to the physics of how they polarize light and how the transistors turn on and off pixels by passing current through the liquid crystal.\nIf you were to take a photograph of your screen and show what you are seeing we might know if this is short or long term image persistence or perhaps something else like polarization effects or a defect in the operation of a transistor or the circuitry of the LCD panel.\n", "Q: iPhone 4S iMessaging to a iPad and iPhone - compilation of message threads I have an iPhone 4s.\nWhen I have conversations via iMessage to friends with an iPad a new message thread is created for the conversation, however when I iMessage their phone another message thread is created, resulting in having two conversations from the same people and as they are both iMessages it is hard to tell the difference!\nI know one is iMessaging through a phone number and another through an email, but it there a way to compile the conversation thread? Or a way to put a note on the contact so I know which conversation is which?\nplease note: the contact has both the email and phone number on it, I realise I can make them separate but is that my only option?\n\nA: I have seen people set up iMessage in two ways:\n\n\n*\n\n*The default manner where you accept messages from all email, phone that you have attached to your Apple ID (and this implies that people can send you message to more than one \"address\" and that conversations will not be threaded).\n\n*By restricting the receiving addressed so that people can only send you messages to either one phone number or one email address so that threading of all messages is forced.\n\n\nYou can change your settings on each device - just go to iMessage and disable all but one email and/or phone number for receiving messages. On iOS 6, open the settings app, tap on Messages, tap on Send & Receive, and ensure that only one address for being reached at is selected.\nThe downside of the second method, is you have to get everyone to only send messages to one account. The default settings were probably designed to ensure that all messages get to you even if it means they don't get threaded and assembled into a unified view.\n\nA: As far as I know, iMessage consider them 2 different conversations. The only way to join them is to use just one address (phone number or mail)\n", "Q: Cannot sync ringtone I have iTunes 11, I'm trying to sync a ringtone to my iPhone, but the ringtone is not added to my ringtones folder (settings->sounds->ringtone) in iOS. The file has a m4r format, and it's currently shown in the \"tones\" tab in Itunes:  \n\nI tried to sync my iPhone many times, and also selected the \"tones\" option in iTunes preferences under the \"general\" tab.

Then go over to the right side of screen and select songs. Go all the way to the bottom of the list of songs and you'll find your ringtones there. You have to uncheck all the ringtones in that music file. Now go and sync your phone again and it'll put all of them on your phone.\n", "Q: How can I browse offline my already visited websites? OK, I am online half of the day and offline the other half using a MacBook Pro. As I am coding primarily on this Mac, I am interested in caching all the websites I visit: especially forums, blogs, technical websites and Apple Documentation.\nI would like to browse my cache in an easy and smart way when I am offline.\nI would like Safari or another browser to keep trace of my browsing without explicitly having to ask. Is this possible, or do I need another tool for this job?\n\nA: Safari has a reading list function to save articles for later reading while offline. Have you investigated that option for some of the easier pages that are static and amenable to reading offline.\nXcode has an option to cache various reference libraries for offline viewing and I personally much prefer that interface over a web browser due to search ability and performance. That clearly isn't a good general solution for other developer documentation, though.\n\nA: For this purpose I use Pocket.\nInstall the Pocket app and then a browser extension (Chrome, Firefox, Safari).\nWhen you 'Pocket' a page, it will be downloaded and cached on your computer if Pocket is open, and even on your mobile device if Pocket is installed there.\nIt will reformat most articles to remove the cruft from the pages if possible, otherwise it will simply cache the page as-is.\n\nA: I don't believe HistoryHound and Pocket to be appropriate solutions because :\nHistoryHound will only work for recently visited pages that are present in the cache of the browser. If for some reasons (web developping) you need to reset the cache while offline you'll be doomed…\nIt seems for Pocket to work you need manual actions.\nI think it would be a better way to install a proxy like SquidMan http://squidman.net/squidman/ this will allow you better control of your cache, thus data for offline viewing. If needed you'll be able to share it with another device. And on top of it you may still install HistoryHound as suggested or SafariCacheExplorer : http://www.beecubu.com/desktop-apps/SafariCacheExplorer/\nUnfortunately there is no easy way to start an \"Automator\" workflow when a page is loading the idea would have been to save while surfing each pages as a \"Web Archive\"…\nYou may also opt for \"Kiosk Monster\" http://bluespark.co.nz/app.php?kioskmonster\n\nA: Maybe HistoryHound is what you are looking for:\n\nFind pages in your Bookmarks or History just by typing words you\n  remember from them!\nHistoryHound lets you do a fast keyword search on the entire content\n  of all web pages and RSS feeds you've visited recently, plus all those\n  that you've bookmarked. It's a \"personal web search.\" Just type in a\n  few keywords and HistoryHound gives you a list of pages you've viewed\n  recently, ranked by relevance.\nHave you ever tried to find something in your browser history or\n  bookmarks, but couldn't quite remember when or where you saw it, or\n  which browser you were using at the time? Or perhaps you've got your\n  bookmarks meticulously organized, but it takes forever to mouse\n  through the menus to get to something you want? HistoryHound will\n  chase down the page for you - fast!\nhttp://www.stclairsoft.com/HistoryHound/index.html\n\n\nA: I use Evernote for this (Clearly plug-in but if you want FULL SITE ACTION... I think http://sitesucker.us/home.html is your only chance.... I also think there's a Windows equivalent but these programs download the entire site to a folder you designate and then you can browse them locally... live ads and other live content won't be available but all the static stuff will be.\nWindows type of program for this is here:  http://www.httrack.com/\nGood Luck!\n\nA: WWWOFFLE caches HTTP responces, which means you will have to set Safari to use it as a proxy.  I believe that WWWOFFLE can be installed by Fink or Homebrew if you do not want to compile it yourself.\n\nA: Since you are coding for mac anyway. Why not make your own simple browser for this task.\nYou can use a webviews  WebDataSource's webarchive (webarchive docs) & writeToFile  on page load or similar notification.\nAn example Assuming _adataSource & _webView are WebDataSource  & webView synthesised properties. \ntitleString, dateString1 are abstained by code to get the mainframe's title and a time stamp respectively:\n_aDataSource =  [[_webView mainFrame]  dataSource]  ;\n NSString * dirPath = [ [NSURL URLWithString:[defaults valueForKey:@\"saveDirectory\" ] ]path];\n        NSString * nameFile =[ NSString  stringWithFormat:@\"%@/%@_%@.webArchive\",dirPath,titleString,dateString1 ];\n\n\n\n        WebArchive *archive1 = [[WebArchive alloc]  initWithMainResource:[_aDataSource mainResource]  subresources:nil  subframeArchives:nil];\n\n\n        NSError *error = nil;\n        if (!

We are talking about things written in 2004 and a lot has changed. The good news is that you should be able to find the hfsdebug binary and poke around to your heart's content while analyzing your particular filesystems as you are determining how it is and is not performing. Furthermore, if you partition your boot volume, the hot file \"optimization\" will be far less helpful than if you just let the entire drive be allocated so that the OS can guess what part of the drive is physically the fastest for access speeds.\nSome very astute engineers have opined that 10.6 was the \"fastest feeling\" OS although I've not seen any good benchmarks comparing 10.6.8 to 10.8.3 or 10.7.5. Snow Leopard clearly doesn't have all the layers of subsystems that Lion and now Mountail Lion have - so from a unix based perspective, you should have great control and understanding of what's going on in the OS most if not all of the time.\nI would also be remiss if I didn't mention that you might want to review John Siracusa's awesome reviews of each OS release to read up on the various filesystem performance improvements. Since hot file adaptive clustering was introduced at 10.3, the performance wars have moved on to building smarter storage technologies rather than smarter OS. An especially good article on this aspect would be also from Ars Technica:\n\n*\n\n*How SSDs conquered mobile devices and modern OSes\n", "Q: Turn off both displays when in clamshell mode I've been using this Macbook Pro for about 2 years now and recently got an external display for it. It is connected via a Thunderbolt to HDMI adapter.\nBefore I got the display, I could simply shut the lid to enable clamshell mode and the system would mostly power down (HDD would stop etc).\nHowever, now whenever I shut the lid, the external monitor becomes the primary display and continues to work and keep the laptop awake. I do not have an external mouse, trackpad or keyboard connected.\nIs there any way to make the laptop go back into clamshell when the lid is shut and turn both displays off? I would prefer if it were possible without disconnecting the external display, as every time I do that I lose my window arrangement across displays.\nI found this, but I don't want point two. I want both displays to wake up when I open the lid, and both displays and the mac to sleep when I close it.\n\nA: You are confusing sleep and clamshell mode. Clamshell mode means using a laptop with an external display while keeping the lid closed.\nAnyway, clamshell mode behaved differently in 10.6 and earlier:\n\n\n*\n\n*Closing the lid put a laptop to sleep even when the laptop was connected to an external display\n\n*To use the laptop in clamshell mode, you had to press a key or click a mouse button after that\n\n*If you then opened the lid, the internal display didn't turn back on\n\n\nYou can restore the old behavior by changing the boot-args firmware variable:\nsudo nvram boot-args=iog=0x0\n\nYou have to restart to apply changes. To undo it, run sudo nvram -d boot-args and restart.\n\nA: It may be easier to use the \"Sleep\" option in the  menu (upper, right). It sounds like the \"clamshell mode\" you're talking about is actually \"Sleep mode\" to the computer. I believe that this is the most effective way to get things into \"sleep mode.\"\nOther options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Setup a \"hot corner\" that puts everything to sleep.\n\n*Use keyboard commands for sleep. (Command + Option + Eject)\n\n\nA: I had this issue too, and came up with this script that monitors your lid state and puts the machine to sleep when lid is closed: https://github.com/pirj/noclamshell\n", "Q: Aborted localhost http requests -- how to troubleshoot? I've got a webserver running on localhost (not the one built into OSX -- a different, proprietary webserver).

Lately though I've been having a bizarre problem.\nSome of the resources (different ones each time) simply aren't loading -- they show status Aborted in Firebug.\n\nWhen I enable the deepest level of debugs on the webserver, I can verify that the webserver never sees the requests at all.  The webserver does not see these requests, as if they never happened.\nThe only way I've found to resolve this is to restart my macbook.  Other things I've tried unsuccessfully:\n\n\n*\n\n*changing IP and Port - doesn't help\n\n*restarting loopback interface (sudo ifconfig lo0 down; sudo ifconfig lo0 up) - doesn't help\n\n*Have disabled all plugins/extensions in FF & Chrome - doesn't help\n\n\nHow can I get to the bottom of this?

No log file functionality, so you would save snapshots of the screen to the camera roll.\n\n*Theodolite - Has log file functionality and all of the above. Can snap the screen easily, add annotations to the locations it logs, etc... A veritable swiss army knife.\n\n\n\nNone of the above apps need data connection - just your iPhone with enough battery charge to run.\n\nA: Perhaps I am misunderstanding the question. But why not just take a photo of the location you want to tag. This will (unless you have turned off location services for the camera app) record the GPS information. You can then create an album with your tagged photos and view them in a map view on your phone\nIf you export the photos you can extract the GPS info using various tools (if you are on a Mac you can simply do a \"Get info\" on the picture to find the GPS location. If you want to automatise the process you could use a tool like Exiftool.\nOther possibilities are to get iPhone apps such as MapPocket, where you can pre-download maps of the area you want to go (Also ideal for holidays abroad, to avoid roaming costs) and then view your location on the map.\n\nA: GeoTags for iPhone\nMaybe this App is a solution for you.

I recently switched to iTerm2 from the default Terminal app and have a usability issue.  \nOn Terminal, the working directory you are in shows up on the title bar along with the process and pixel size.  For example, when you click on Window to switch between different Terminal sessions, you'd see: working_directory - process - pixel_size.  \nOn iTerm2, unfortunately only the process shows in the title bar.  So if I'm working in multiple iTerm2 windows on different directories, I can't easily differentiate which is which when I click on Window to choose one.  I know I can easily switch between iTerm2 windows once I select one, but I'd like to identify exactly which window I want right away.  (By the way, I use Witch, and Command-tabbing doesn't help either because here again only the process shows up on the list).  \nAny suggestions?  I looked through all the preferences and didn't see anything.  Creating profiles isn't exactly what I'm after--I'd just like to see the current working directory in iTerm2 window titles.  \n\nA: Possibly a simpler answer is to use the string interpolation functionality offered by iTerm 2.

I'm in the UK, and recently changed from a pre-pay carrier (GiffGaff) to EE. My data usage with GiffGaff was about 100-125 MB every two weeks; with EE, I've used nearly 250 MB in the first 5 days. My usage is the same: email, web, Twitter, and some Maps.

Resetting the iPad by holding down the button on the top and on the front did.\n\nPhew!\n", "Q: Is there a guideline for the max number of active fonts I manage my fonts through FontExplorer X. Today I noticed that I have 770 fonts activated. All legitimately licensed, by the way. The Adobe CS family installs a bunch, I've purchased and have received many more from friends: I could easily activate a 1,000+ fonts. (I'm referring to individual font files, not 1,000 font families).\nAt different times I've heard that it's not a good practice to have too many fonts active at once, but I can't find any guidelines as to what constitutes too many, and I really don't understand where the overhead is spent. Is it simply the font-listing UI's in different apps, or does every active font actually bring some overhead at a general OS performance level?\nLet me know if my inquiry is unclear.\n\nA: I would say you are the slowest part of the equation in most cases. If you find yourself slowing down since you have too many choices, slim down your fonts. If not, don't worry until you notice a program you need to be responsive lagging.\nOn the CPU side, any computer will track 10,000 files as easily as it tracks 1. Unless you have software that is really poorly programmed and refuses to render a font menu until it loads a sample of each of the 1000 font faces - you'll likely not ever notice a slow down. No one cleans out their iTunes library since there are 10,000 or 40,000 music files since you never access them all at once. The smart programmer makes an ordered list to hold the playlists and only references the files when you need to play a specific song.\nYou can test this yourself by opening a word processor and a spreadsheet and open the font picker. Time how fast it loads and then go in and deactivate 900 of the font faces and repeat the measurement.\nYou'll probably have slowness the first time the program or the OS has to traverse the list of active fonts and do some caching. After that, the speed to open the UI should be basically constant whether you have 100, 1000 or 10000 items to load.\n", "Q: Is there a way to copy the link URL in Safari (Mac OS X) without using right click? In Safari, if you want to copy the link URL, you should do 3 operations:\n\n\n*\n\n*Hover the link\n\n*Right-click the link \n\n*Use the \"Copy link\" item from the main/contextual menu\n\n\nAlternatively, you can hover/navigate to the link and then select the link (usually if textual) by using the mouse/trackpad. Then you hit CMD+C and have the link copied, but these are still 3 operations (navigate/hover, select, copy). \nSo, the question: Is there a way in Safari to reduce the above to just 2 operations:  1) Hover and 2) Copy ?\nIt seems there are similar tools/plugins for Firefox and Chrome:\n\n\n*\n\n*Chrome: Copy link address\n\n*Firefox: Copy URL on Mouse Over\nThere is even a plugin for Safari which does something similar, but not exactly: Type to navigate. The issue is that this plugin is not designed to solve the above problem, so even though the plugin allows you to copy the link you have selected, it is not solving the real problem - how to reduce the steps to just 2 (hover and copy).\nIdeas are welcome!\n\nA: Select Command-L\nThat will highlight the URL field\nThen just select Command-C to copy.\nThis is the quickest keyboard shortcuts I have found.\n\nA: Depending on what you are trying to do with the link, it may be sufficient to drag it. If you click and drag a link in Safari, you can drop it in many places and get the desired functionality. For example, if you drop it in a text editor, it will drop the link URL (for plain text) or a formatted link using the title from the page. If you drop it on your desktop, you will get a webloc file. If you drop it on the Safari URL bar or tab, that tab will load the link.\nIf you really need to copy the link, one possibility is to use spotlight as a easy-access text field. Start dragging the link, hit Command+space (or whatever you have it set to) to pop up spotlight, drop it in the search field, and copy.\n\nA: Is there a wider description of your use case for this, or is this the only function you'd like to have in Safari?  \ni.e. You can use an Automator action to return all links and pass that to another action, if you are trying to pick up all links in a page via Get Link URLs from Webpages if you are attempting to automate grabbing links in general, not just the one you are hovering over.\n\nA: This can be done using the StopTheMadness extension (paid).\nSimply hover on any link and press ⌘ + C. URL of the link will be copied to the clipboard.\nIt is available in the Mac App Store.\n", "Q: iPod plugged in I've been sleeping with my iPod. \nBut it's plugged in to the wall and I always put it in bed with me while charging .\nIs it dangerous to have a plugged iPod in bed with you while sleeping .\n\nA: As with all things in life there are some risks you may want to be aware of here:\n\n\n*\n\n*You might get entangled into the cord and either endager yourself or damage the phone/cord/plug by ripping it out of the wall when you turn yourself\n\n*You may end up laying on top of your phone leading to overheating and your bed catching fire\n\n*Electro-magnetic radiation from the cord may or may not impact your sleep pattern\n\n*One of the tracks you are listening to may be much louder than the others leading to a unpleasant wake up call in the middle of the night\n\n\nOTOH I've never heard of anybody dying in their sleep due to a plugged in iPod so the probability of the more severe incidents is extremely low. And you could work around most of the risks above by getting a bluetooth headset and putting the iPod on a table besides your bed.\n", "Q: Remapping \"Command + Arrow Key\" to jump through the words of CamelCase expressions? I often go through sentences word-by-word, using Command+Arrow Keys. \nHowever, when there is a word in camel case (e.g. \"AppleForumsQuestion.txt\", in filenames or so), that won't work - Command+Arrow Keys only snaps to spaces.\nIs there any (system-wide, ideally) way to make it move the cursor to the individual \"words\" of also camel-case expressions?\n\nA: ⌃← and ⌃→ do that by default in many code editors like Xcode, TextMate, Sublime Text, and BBEdit. (If you have disabled the shortcuts for changing desktops.) You can change the shortcuts in TextMate by overriding KeyBindings.dict.\nI have tried adding something like this to DefaultKeyBinding.dict:\n\"^\\UF702\" = moveSubWordLeft:; // control-left\n\"^\\UF703\" = moveSubWordRight:; // control-right\n\nIt doesn't work in other applications though. And ⌘← and ⌘→ can't even be reassigned in DefaultKeyBinding.dict.\n", "Q: Adobe Creative Cloud: Mac App Alternatives? A couple of days ago Adobe announced that its Creative Suite Software is to be rebranded as Creative Cloud, the development of its creative suit line will come to an end.\nWhilst Adobe CS6 will still be supported and available for purchase, all future products will be provided through the subscription-only Creative Cloud service. However even with discounts, Adobe's software was out of the price range for many students and entry-level professionals.\nHowever I see a problem in that alot of people don't always have guaranteed income. If income runs short one month and they can't make the subscription payment, their access to the software that provides their livelihood is cut off. Whilst other won't want to be tied to a subscription service or use the cloud.\nSo therefore my question is:\nWhat are the best Mac App alternatives which are cheaper (or perhaps free), that provide the same or similar core functionality in each of Adobe's products to make your very own Creative Suite ?\nEdit:\nPerhaps one app per answer with a link to the Mac App Store, and brief description.\n\nA: For a Photoshop \"equivalent\", there is already Photoshop Element (80$) that is cheaper but has much less functionalities. \nOf course there is also Gimp (Free), but IMHO it's horrible to use on OSX and not available on the Mac App Store. \nIf you're looking for a simple and quite powerful software for your money, there is Pixelmator (16$) or Acorn (currently on sale for 30$).\n\nA: For an Illustrator \"equivalent\", there is Inskape, (Open Source, Free, Not on the MacAppStore) \nOn the MacApp Store you have iDraw (25$) or Sketch (50$) \n\nA: For a Premiere Pro \"Equivalent\", you have Premiere Element (80$).\nFor a real equivalent, there is still Apple's Final Cut Pro X (300$)  or Avid Media Composer (1000$, Not on MAS)\n\nA: Swift Publisher 3 ($19.99)\nPage layout editor which is a suitable alternative to Adobe Indesign. Comes with plenty of pre-defined templates to choose from.  It also has the ability to create additional templates. Allows the creation of professional-looking brochures, fliers and newsletters.\n", "Q: Can MacFusion be used under Mountain Lion? I have bought a new MacBook Pro with Retina display which has OS X 10.8.3. I have installed MacFusion from the version on their website, but I cannot mount it, getting this error: Could not mount filesystem: Mount process has terminated unexpectedly.\nCan you help me with that?\n\nA: Unfortunately Macfusion no longer works, it hasn't been maintained in a long time. Newer versions were around for a while but as near as I can tell, none of them work anymore either. Your best bet is a commercial product which can mount FTP or WebDAV disks such as Transmit. For mounting disks via SSH, I believe we're out of luck.\nSuch is progress.\n\nA: Macfusion has been forked on GitHub by another developer and a pre-2.1 development build is available that operates under Mountain Lion with no issues yet that I've discovered; both SSHFS and FTPFS work with FUSE for OS X if the MacFUSE compatibility layer is installed.\nIf you're feeling adventurous, you can download the build or build it yourself from https://github.com/ElDeveloper/macfusion2.\nAlternatively, the original Macfusion 2.0.4 can also be convinced to work again as a front end for SSH mounts and this works under ML, if you also install FUSE for OS X and SSHFS (also available from the same site), then modify it so that the sshfs-static binary points to the one from SSHFS, by running the following commands in Terminal:\ncd /Applications/Macfusion.app/Contents/PlugIns/sshfs.mfplugin/Contents/Resources\nmv sshfs-static sshfs-static.orig\nln -s /usr/local/bin/sshfs sshfs-static\n\nHowever, it's a bit finicky.  Mounting and unmounting SSHFS filesystems works fine, but attempting to remove a filesystem from the Macfusion list will fail.\nI am unaware of a way to re-enable FTPFS functionality in Macfusion 2.0.4.\nMore information: SSHFS Installation: Macfusion\n\nA: I ran across a post from the developer of WingFS pointing out his BSD licensed software will work on 10.8 to mount not only SFTP, but other services as well. I had tried macfusion2 which was failing. \nWingFS worked the first time, and so I can GBTW. It's at http://wingfs.com for those that are interested. It doesn't seem to have every feature but it got the job done, with a UI that worked!\n", "Q: Keyboard layout for math I usually need to write math with LaTeX, and after seeing this question: Entering unicode math symbols. I came here with some small questions.\nI find that not perfectly comfortable, and I was wondering if there is a way in which I could tell the system to differentiate between the left and right alt ⌥. So I could have much more symbols within one letter.\nAnd, the another question is if there is a way I could turn the caps lock ⇪ into a different key (with the same use as alt ⌥, but the system should differentiate them). In this way I could use, for instance,\n\n\n*\n\n*caps lock ⇪d to get the greek letters (in this case the letter delta δ), and\n\n*alt ⌥d to get some math symbol of my decision (in this case the partial differential symbol ∂).\n\n\nThis is not a great example, but more or less self explaining. Of course then caps lock ⇪ shouldn't be a turn on/turn off button. It should be turned on ONLY when pressed (exactly like alt ⌥).\n\nA: I believe this is all possible. In my answer on TeX.SE, I give the MathUnicode.keylayout file that I made. Essentially, my advice is: go ahead and play around with this file. \nA couple of thoughts:\n\n\n*\n\n*The XML specification for .keylayout files is available from Apple.\n\n*On line 22 you can see that I refer to the anyOption modifier. This refers to the left or right option key. But you can also write option or rightOption if you wish to distinguish between the two.\n\n*I'm not sure whether caps can be treated as a \"hold down\" key, as you want it, rather than a \"press on / press off\" key.\n", "Q: Is there a network usage utility that shows data usage by network connection I use my Mountain Lion MacBook Air to connect to the internet using various methods. At home, I use my wired connection, which does not have a cap. Sometimes though, I connect via my iPad, which uses LTE, and does have a bandwidth cap. At other times, I connect through 3G on my iPhone, where the bandwidth cap is even lower.\nIs there a utility which would run on my computer and automatically track and record the amount of data sent. I am interested in seeing the data by connection (which WiFi network I connect to) and be aggregatable by date (so I can see for today only, month-to-date, previous month, etc). For example, I would like to be able to see how many megabytes of bandwidth I have used in March 2013 while connected to a WiFi network called \"Bob's LTE\" or May 1st through May 8th 2013  while connected to \"Bob's iPhone\".\nDoes such a beastie exist?\n\nA: If you are looking for simple real time statistics, checkout iStat Pro. \nIt is a widget that provides a lot more than just network information.\nhttp://www.apple.com/downloads/dashboard/status/istatpro.html\nSurplus Meter or Net Monitor look like they would do exactly what you want:\nhttp://mac.appstorm.net/roundups/internet-roundup/4-ways-to-monitor-bandwidth-usage-on-your-mac/\n", "Q: Cursor does not go begining of the line Hello I am trying to go begining of the line. neither left arrow key or ctrl + a \nlets me do it. everytime it keeps couple letters on the right.\nhowever its a visual bug my cursor is actually in the begining \nI am not exactly sure why it happens but it happen both on default terminal app and iterm2\n\n\nP.S : it isnt only happens with this command I just didnt know what else to write to show.\n\nA: That issue is related to your $PS1, you're probably missing some escape character.\nThis one should work:\nPS1=\"\\[\\e[1;31m\\]\\u[\\w]$\\[\\e[0m\\] \"\n", "Q: iMessage Alerts When using iMessage on a Mac and an iPod Touch, we get alert for every message in each device. That means, getting double alerted at a time.\nFor example, a new message comes and both Mac and iPod alerts. Are there any ways to get notified for once ?\nThanks.\n\nA: I don't think so because it wouldn't be able to tell which device you are using and when. But what you could do is change your mac notifications to not receive any notifications for the messages app, however if you use messages.app for other messaging services, you probably won't get notifications for those either though. But once you read the message on any of your devices it should disappear, so if you were on your mac and read it, it would disappear from you iOS lock screen.\n", "Q: Mission Control view programme icons missing.

How can I get these icons back?\nThis is how my Mission Control looks like:\n\nThis is how it is supposed to look like, with programme icons:\n\n\nA: You have the \"Group windows by application\" option turned off – this tiles every window individually so that nothing overlaps (this is how Exposé used to work in OS X 10.5 Leopard and earlier).\nWhen \"Group windows by application\" is on, the tiled windows are stacked in groups based on which application they belong to, and the application icon is overlaid on the group, as in your second screenshot.\nTo enable \"Group windows by application\", go to the Apple menu > System Preferences > Mission Control and check the box.\n", "Q: Edit symlinked files in Dropbox I have a soft symlink between the Documents folder on my main computer and a folder in Dropbox, say dbDocs.

Or will the symlink just overwrite the newly edited file in dbDocs with the corresponding file from Documents? \n\nA: The quick answer is that if you open Documents/thesis.tex after editing it in your Dropbox folder on another computer, you will see the changes. As @Mark said in a comment, a symlink is simply a pointer to another location on your computer. If that other location has its contents changed, those changes will be visible when using the symlink in Documents, just as they would if you examined the file directly in the Dropbox folder.\n", "Q: My ipad mini shows 66% power but won't charge My iPad mini shows 66% power but will not charge.  Is there a power level it must drop to so it can charge?

Try another iPad charger and see if it charges.\n(note, USB 3.0 ports on Macs seem to be able to charge iPads, but I haven't discovered a PC port that will actually charge an iPad, don't rely on USB for diagnosis)\nFinally, the iPad mini came out late last year right? It's still under warranty, back up if you can and setup an appointment at the apple genius bar and they'll swap out whatever item is not functioning for free.\n\nA: Verify that you are using the charger and cable that came with the iPad and see if that will charge it. Many chargers and cables will work with other devices that will not work with the iPad. \n\nA: make sure that you provide enough current (especially if its a newer Ipad)\nMy ipad 3 needs 1000mA otherwise it will not charge. \nWhich practically means that if you use a charger for an older i-device it will not charge .

We are writing the policy of a small company to create 100 Apple ID for their employees. Half will work primarily on iPads and the other half on Macs. We have decided to try to use two-step authentication rather than the traditional, pick three security questions and answers for the work Apple ID.\nMany of our workers do not have iOS devices to carry with them, so we will rely on SMS for the pin notification part of the process and have each employee list a corporate SMS number as one of their options so that IT can assist them with resetting an account should the password need to be reset.\nEmployees with personal SMS and personal and/or work iOS devices will of course list those as additional trusted devices as part of the setup process, but we need to cover all employees wither they have a cell phone, iPod or not. If we ensure that the first SMS number is a work controlled cell phone, we can prevent losing control of these Apple ID by maintaining that service and also escrowing the recovery keys for each work account.\n\nHas anyone run into problems with using Apple ID in this manner or is there a deployment guide that Apple has published to help us decide how to implement Apple ID in the workplace?\n\nA: I will say that I have seen two small organizations do this, but the overhead of setting up the escrow of recovery keys took more effort than we are likely to save in three years of supporting the accounts. \n\n\n*\n\n*the actual setup went smoothly\n\n*people seemed comfortable with mixing work and personal accounts despite the added confusion that it can cause\n\n*we didn't run into any roadblocks registering common trusted devices.\n\n\nAlso, now that Volume Purchase Plan redemptions can be reclaimed and they are not lost when issuing expensive apps to personal Apple ID, the need to more tightly control which Apple ID is used to redeem a purchase is not nearly as valuable as it would have been in the cases where we looked at implementing this.\nThe strategy we are now taking is to just establish a written policy that work apps are to be returned to work - just like work computers and work phones and have employees sign for the tools they are provided with an HR policy to deduct value for tools not properly returned at the end of employment.\n", "Q: make new Finder windows open at current folder In Windows when I browse in Explorer, if I open a new Explorer window, it is opened to the same location as the window I had selected when I hit Ctrl-N.

But I need it on the Terminal so I can do this via SSH.\nNote, I am not asking how to set these options (e.g. through the ARD \"kickstart\" executable), I am asking how, once it is running, to determine what options it is running under.\nps -axlww | grep ARD shows only /System/Library/CoreServices/RemoteManagement/ARDAgent.app/Contents/MacOS/ARDAgent without any flags shown.\nIs there a plist file where this is stored?

It switches to the foreground, but no action is taken.\nAfter much googling and thinking, I have the impression that the easiest way to accomplish this(don't want to BUY and app for this simple thing), is to write an app in applescript for it.\nThe areas I'd appreciate help with are:\n• What is the format for Picasas call to apps: does it send the paths to the pictures I'm sending as arguments AKA parameters, as a memory block, or what? \n• How do I pick up the picture paths to create an attachment list? \n• How do I send the request to Chrome, to create a new email with the attached files? I'm thinking by \"simply\" building a mailto: string with the picture paths attached, and invoking Chrome with the mailto: string as argument(s), but I don't know if that's possible, and if not, how else to make Chrome understand what I want it to do.\nThanks,\nI've seen Webmailer, along with other apps of the same kind. Alas, they all refer to mailto links, which isn't really what I'm looking for.\nStill, I downloaded and tried Webmailer, and to sum up, the Shell Script feature MIGHT help, if I can get it to work, and if I knew what to look for.\n\n\n*\n\n*I've tried the Shell Scripts feature on mailto links in a document(TextEdit), and it permits me to log the calling arguments, which is what I hoped to do with the call from Picasa. But when I select Webmailer for e-Mail in Picasa, ABSOLUTELY NOTHING happens: even if I set Webmailer to compose an email in stead, it doesn't even start Chrome.\n\n*I'm focusing on Picasa: if anyone can tell me how to use the Email icon(quote: \"Send photos in the Photo Tray by e-mail\") in Picasa, then I'm content. From there on, I'm sure I can extend that solution to any other app from which I want to send attachments: pls refer to my initial questions above.\n\n*Regarding attachments(the reason I want to have this working in Picasa, obviously), there also seem to be a problem with the mailto protocol: I haven't found any confirmation that it supports attachments at all. That's why I'm thinking that the solution MUST involve some programming, so there doesn't seem to be much of a choice in that regard.\nThanks,\n\nA: Unless you're dying to program this yourself, you should probably check out Webmailer. It does pretty much exactly what you're looking for — a handler for mailto links and other system email actions that will redirect them to Gmail, or whatever else you want (it can work with scripts or any URL you want to give it). It's no longer maintained, but I believe it works with Mountain Lion, and it's not the sort of thing that's likely to break anytime soon.\n\nA: I would suggest that you visit the Chrome store, get the GMail extension made by GMail, install it. Research how you find and open Chrome extension files on your disk. If I remember correctly the GMail extension has the option to make Chrome + Gmail the default Mac email application. You may learn something by exploring the code of that extension. It may help you create something similar for your web mail client. Good luck.\n", "Q: iOS Enrollment of device with a PIN code sent by e-mail In my company, we would use the Apple MDM software linked to Active Directory.\nWe would use the self enrollment system of iOS devices proposed by OS X Lion Server.\nThe main problem is that to log-on, the user must input their password on the  (/MyDevices web app). \nBut our users don't know their password, because we use a biometric system for the logon on our windows machine.\nIs there a way to logon with a PIN number sent by e-mail?\nDo you have any advices?\n\nA: Mountain Lion may not support this feature, but MDM providers like AirWatch have token/PIN based enrollment for just this purpose. Users are not requirement to input user information (although you can configure it that way if you like) and they are sent their token via email or SMS.\n\nA: Full biometric authentication is too advanced for the profile manager on Mountain Lion with Server installed. Furthermore, iOS doesn't log in using a pin or pass phrase except for the lock screen. \nSo, you could use profile manager to lock the devices remotely once they were enrolled, so there's nothing stopping you from remotely choosing a PIN for each device and mailing that to the account of a person assigned to that device. \n", "Q: iTunes 11 interface illegible I'm having issues with the iTunes interface being illegible.

Without jailbreaking, the only way an app could be password protected is if the app developer builds it in. To do otherwise would require modifying the functionality of the parts of the system responsible for launching apps (Springboard), which Apple's rules don't allow, and I suspect that won't change in the foreseeable future, if ever.\n\nA: This isn't possible directly, but you can enable parental restrictions with a passcode and deactivate it when you wish to use something. However, this is a very incomplete and impractical solution as it only works on certain stock apps.\n", "Q: Time Machine hasn't been backing up the full system since before 10.8.3 Look at your hard drive.

Try entering Time Machine from the Finder and just look for those folders from there.\nIf you're sure that those folders aren't in the backup, check System Preferences -> Spotlight -> Privacy.\nTo check all the excluded items, you can execute this command from Terminal:\nsudo mdfind \"com_apple_backup_excludeItem = 'com.apple.backupd'\"\n\nIt will display a list of excluded paths.\nIf you can't identify the source of the issue, I suggest to wipe the backup drive and to make a new backup.\n\nA: Well, this thread exists, which I must have missed when I first looked into the problem.\nWhile I'm not sure why the issue was occurring, I can reasonably say that it was related to 10.8.3, and at least one other person I asked was not experiencing the same.\nAnyhow, this behavior is caused by /Library/Preferences/com.apple.TimeMachine.plist, and in particular, either the SkipSystemFiles bool key or the ExcludeByPath array.\nEdit that file with admin privs to your liking using your favorite binary plist editor, re-login, and try to run a backup.

It is jail broken.\nI connect to the internet via the university WiFi system, which provided each of us a unique username and password, and we have a set download limit.\nAfter logging in through my iPhone, after about 10 minutes, the iPhone disconnects itself and reverts itself to my data plan. \nI do not understand the cause for this. How can I rectify this? Are there any jailbreak tweaks availabe from cydia?\n\nA: One possibility is that your phone is determining that the data connection is stronger/faster than the wireless connection and is purposefully changing to the more powerful connection. To test if this is the case, you can disable Cellular data on your phone when you want it to be connected only to the wifi. Not an optimal solution, but one that guarantees your data plan is saved.\nDisabling the Cellular Data is under Settings > General > Cellular > Cellular Data and disable the option.\nIf the phone continues to disconnect with Cellular Data disabled, it's possible that your phone is experiencing the access points in the area having a channel conflict either with each other or with other wireless broadcast points in the area. This can happen if someone has one of the portable wireless access points broadcasting or when the access points in the area are not properly configured (or are on automatic channel select). There is also a possibility that the access point nearest you is on channel 1 and iOS devices really tend to prefer channel 6 or especially 11.\nI work for a company that provides public wireless access at various locations and have experienced all of the above possibilities at various points with customers on iOS devices.

I bought some cheap (around 40 USD) Chinese crap, but designed specifically for iPad Mini -- i.e. an aluminium cover with Bluetooth keyboard inside.\nThe problem is, that iPad Mini is always disconnecting Bluetooth connection with this keyboard, once it goes dark, and can't re-establish it, once it comes back. As you may read from the following, detailed description, this seems not to be a keyboard-related problem.\nSo, the general question here is, how to force iPad Mini to keep Bluetooth connection alive even once it get off? Or, how to force it to reconnect to once paired device, after it returns on-line? So I don't have to re-pair device each time, I want to use it? Details follows.\nIssue happens any time iPad Mini or Bluetooth connection is disabled -- i.e. screen is turned off, it has Bluetooth turned-off (same, as if I disable Bluetooth in the keyboard itself) or keyboard or iPad is turned off completely. Always after turning on, un-dimming or re-enabling Bluetooth, devices must be paired again. I.e. iPad Mini has my keyboard on Bluetooth devices list, but always marked as \"disconnected\". I had to tap it, enter PIN code on the keyboard and hit Enter to re-pair devices again.\nIt happens always, even after two minutes lasting screen-dim, when both devices are all the time on and Bluetooth is enabled on both of them. As you may imagine, this is very frustrating and causes using this keyboard nearly useless.\nI've contacted manufacturer (supplier) of my keyboard and got immediate reply, that they weren't able to test exactly this keyboard, as they out of iPad Minis, but they tested very similar one with iPhone 4S and iPad 2. An no matter, what they did, devices were reconnecting together after any of them were awaken. There were no need to re-pair devices or enter PIN code once they were initially paired-up. This caused supplier to think, that device is malfunctioning and ask me to send it back to them.\nJust before I did so, I made some tests with other devices. I used two Android-based devices, though keyboard is designed for iPad Mini with iOS. I conluded following tests:\n\n\n*\n\n*screen dim and un-dim in tested device,\n\n*waiting 15 minutes for keyboard to go to power-saving mode,\n\n*turning off Bluetooth on device and turning it on back,\n\n*turning off Bluetooth on keyboard and turning it on back,\n\n*completely turning off the device with Bluetooth enabled and restarting it back,\n\n*completely turning off keyboard by using its power switch.\n\n\nAnd -- shock (at least to me)! -- absolutely no problems. Exactly as supplier wrote to me -- no matter, what I would do, once both devices are brought back on-line, their pair-up and connect automatically and I can use it instantly or in worst scenario, I have to press any key on the keyboard and wait 3-5 seconds until it wakes up and reconnect.\nSo this is clearly not a hardware problem and keyboard is working just fine.\nEvery time I turn my iPad Mini's screen on, I clearly see that Bluetooth icon in status bar is grayed, meaning, that Bluetooth is enabled, but all connections has been disconnected and there is no active device connected. This does not happens on Android-based devices. If I un-dim them, reconnect Bluetooth or even restart entire device, I see active Bluetooth icon, which is nearly immediately replaced with active connection icon.\nI have read this and this topic, but it brought me no help.\nI have dig through entire iPad configuration, but found no option about keeping Bluetooth connections to devices alive or pairing them up permanently.\nIf anyone have any idea, what is wrong, or what I'm doing wrong, please share it here. Being forced to go to configuration, reconnect keyboard and enter PIN each time I want to make use of it, simply drives me crazy. On the other hand I can't send keyboard back to the supplier, because it seems that it is 100% fine and iPad Mini is doing some strange things.\nFinally, is this case something for local Apple support? Does Apple supports solving problems with third-party devices? As I convinced myself and proved, this seems to be 100% iPad Mini-related problem, but I understand that it may take years to convince Apple support representative, that problem is not caused by Chinese keyboard.\n\nA: Being \"cheap Chinese crap\" it probably has a generic Bluetooth name like \"Bluetooth Keyboard\" and maybe has a generic hardware identifier, too.  The iPad (or pretty much any computer) can get confused when paired with two different devices that do not distinguish themselves and you might have some conflicting remnant of pairing with another device.  So try deleting all the bluetooth parings in your iPad mini and then re-pair this keyboard.\n\nA: I had this problem too. Turns out the solution was dead simple - just start hitting a few keys and the keyboard will connect.\n", "Q: Where is the official Apple documentation for the Terminal App? I need a list of escape sequences Terminal.app does not implement all xterm sequences. I need to get the complete list of what it does implement.

This has been driving me nuts for close to a year. I hope someone can tell me what triggers it. I've searched many times over several months and have never found any mention of it.\nI use an MBP running OS X 10.8.3 with external monitors, external keyboard and external trackpad. Occasionally while I am manipulating windows with the trackpad (usually moving them by dragging, I think) all of the open windows for all apps will begin minimizing to the dock, one at a time, using the genie effect. Depending on the number of windows I have open, this can take several seconds. I have no idea what, specifically, I'm doing that triggers this behavior.\nIt is NOT \"show desktop\" -- the windows definitely fly down to the dock and are minimized, they do not slide to the edges of the screen. The windows are not hidden -- they don't come back with cmd-tab, for example, and they don't disappear instantly -- they \"genie\" down to the dock. The closest I've found is option-cmd-M, except that it only minimizes windows for the current app -- the behavior I'm asking about minimizes ALL windows from ALL apps.\nHelp? Please? Thanks!\n\nA: I've found no default bindings that would make this occur, but I have found an application that possibly could be triggering what's occuring. There is a background application called MagicPrefs which allows for the addition of non-default bindings. MagicPrefs would also allow you to bind AppleScript to things like this as well.\n\nA: I believe this is triggered when you have the cursor over the dock...\nthree fingers down over a window shows all the similar windows open..\nthree fingers down when the cursor is over the dock hides everything including anything on the deskop.\n\nA: three fingers swipe up will do what you are telling about, I think.  it works on my Dell\n\nA: BetterTouchTool, from http://blog.boastr.net, offers many window-related functions, such as minimize/maximize/resize and many more. Each action can be assigned to a different trackpad gesture (which you can choose!).\nJust as an example: I set up my computer to maximize windows using three finger taps on the top of the window, four finger taps to drag windows, tiptaps to close windows any many more.

Everything runs, but then the script runs every minute which is getting annoying since I'm opening a few programs in the script. If typing code it gets frustrating as it changes the active window.\nNote, this is my first applescript and plist excercise so feel free to critique my code. The goal of the script is to be scheduled to run twice daily (2 plists) - in the am change my IM status to available, open some programs and enable an email account. In the evening, change status, disable email.\nSince it's re running I figured it was simply the plist, but comparing it to other templates for accomplishing a task which repeats once daily it checks out to me.\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n          <key>Label</key>\n          <string>RMWEBENABLE</string>\n          <key>ProgramArguments</key>\n          <array>\n                    <string>/disablemail.app/Contents/MacOS/applet</string>\n          </array>\n          <key>StartCalendarInterval</key>\n          <dict>\n                    <key>Hour</key>\n                    <integer>8</integer>\n                    <key>Minute</key>\n                    <integer>2</integer>\n          </dict>\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\nSo I'm assuming in my ignorace I have something that's not sucessfully closing an if statement or somethign is just done ineffeciently.

I'm in the process of cleaning up my wickedly bad \"Digital Photos\" folder. I've got a workflow I like, but I need a better way of selecting the files.

I need to move all the *.jpg files to a single directory for easier processing, and having to do it one folder at a time after 10+ years of mis-matched filing systems is just taking way too long.\n\nA: You could also restrict Spotlight to specific folders or file types and then move all the result files.\n\n\nA: I created an Automator application that does what you're looking for.

I have not, however, been able to identify the cause. Taking a look at the System Console report shows nothing enlightening. Taking a look at /var/etc/appfirewall.log shows lots of these, though I'm not yet sure if they correlate to the Firewall request message:\n<Info>: Stealth Mode connection attempt to UDP 192.168.1.139:61264 from 192.168.1.1:53\n\nOther answers on the site don't seem to be relevant to me: one identifies Facebook Video Calling as the problem, but I don't have Facebook Video Calling installed. (Nor would I!)\nI've just tried disabling Stealth Mode in the hopes that it may resolve the issue. In the meantime, however, a few questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is it possible that the Stealth Mode issue is what I'm seeing?\n\n*If not, is there anything I can do to capture the screen at relatively low resolution continuously for a while so I can just pick up exactly what the application is?\n\n*Why in the world would the firewall dialog go away? Is this what happens if the requesting application stops requesting access, or is something else going on?\n\n\nUpdate\nThe number and frequency of the popups seems to have diminished significantly after disabling Stealth Mode, and I'm no longer seeing that particular set of messages (none today at all, in fact). Now, however, I'm seeing another message (that was appearing before as well, but with much less frequency):\n<Info>: java is listening from :::0 proto=6\n\nSome answers to similar questions have suggested simply allowing Java through the firewall. This is, in my mind, more than a little bit crazy; I have Java on my system because I have to, but it is a major security hole these days and I have no interest in letting it have unrestricted access to the internet.

I follow Unix Tool Tip on Twitter and it is interesting that many of the tips that are posted are not available on OS X.  \nFor example:\n\ncp - u will only copy files that don't exist, or are newer than their existing counterparts, in the destination directory.\n\nTrying this on my machine results in:\ncp: illegal option -- u\nusage: cp [-R [-H | -L | -P]] [-fi | -n] [-apvX] source_file target_file\n   cp [-R [-H | -L | -P]] [-fi | -n] [-apvX] source_file ... target_directory  \n\nWhy are these options not available and is it possible to get access to them on OS X?\n\nA: The reason is that OSX uses BSD command line tools and the Unix tool tip users are probably using Linux which uses GNU command line tools. \nYou can install GNU tools on OSX (and BSD on Linux).\nThe easiest way is to use a package manager like Macports, Homebrew or Fink\n\nA: Get homebrew and have it install the core utilities.

Once you've installed Homebrew, you can type\nbrew install coreutils\n\nand install the GNU Coreutils. These will provide you with sed, date, printf, wc and many other tools that ship with GNU/Linux, but not OS X. However, so as not to \"override\" default OS X binaries, they will be prefixed with g by default. So, after installing the Coreutils, if you want to use GNU sed, type\ngsed\n\nIf this is too much of a hassle to type every time, you can add a \"gnubin\" directory to your PATH and just call GNU sed with sed.

TL;DR I have a number of MP3 albums in iTunes that I would like to convert from 196kbps to 128kbps.\n\nI ripped a number of CDs into iTunes at 196kbps, but have decided that I want them to be at 128kbps to conserve space - as a compilation of them will be downloaded from the internet, by others, later. \nI opened iTunes preferences and changed the import settings to 128kbps, then selected File -> Create New Version -> Create MP3 Version, after selecting the files from one of the albums. This worked great and it created a lower bit rate copy of the files. In Finder it appends a \"1\" to the end of each track name - so I see:\n\nTrack 01\nTrack 01 1\nTrack 02\nTrack 02 1 \n     etc. \n\nHowever, in iTunes it is just: \n\nTrack 01\nTrack 01\nTrack 02\nTrack 02 \n     etc.\n\nThus it is difficult to tell - without opening \"Get Info\" on every file - which one is the 128kbps.\nI consulted this KB article, but the information in it didn't seem to exactly match my setup (even though I am running iTunes 11 on OSX 10.8). For example, in step #3 it says to go to File -> \"Create New Version\" -> \"Create Format Version\". The closest thing I could find is what I mentioned above, and I wasn't able to find \"Create New Version\". Even then it looked like it would evoke the same situation as what I have.\nAlso, when I open Finder and delete the original files, iTunes recognizing them even though they are in Trash. Perhaps there would be a re-index that?\nHow can I convert the files I have, or have iTunes display the \"1\" addendum in the track listing? Should I just re-rip the files, or is there another software I should turn to?\n\nA: Although quality will be lost when converting the bit rate to 128kbps, one option is to use a combination of a smart playlist in iTunes and Max.\n1) Either back up music library or specify a different output directory in Max, and then re-import files to iTunes.\n2) In iTunes, create a smart playlist where the bit rate is greater than 128 kbps for example.\n3) Select the files from the playlist and drag them to the conversion window in Max. Preferences in Max should be setup so that the output files will be stored in the same location as input files if you want the originals replaced. There is also an option checkbox to \"Overwrite existing files\" and \"Delete source files after encoding\". This will take care of the re-naming issue. There is also an option to add output files to the iTunes library under the iTunes 'tab'.\nDepending on the size of your library, it may be necessary to convert the mp3 files in chunks.\n\nA: I have realised that importing files I have downloaded, the bitrate of the file will remain, no matter what it is. Unlike importing a CD which will import it at the settings you choose.\nSo, to decrease file size, I set the import bitrate to the desired rate (e.g. 128 kbps) and select all of the files I want to convert. Once highlighted, right click the lot and choose Create MP3 Version. Do not click on anything until it is completely finished encoding. Only then, right click one of the highlighted tracks, and choose Delete and Move to trash.\nAs a bonus you can add columns for Bit Rate and Date Added to the track list by right-clicking in the header line.\n", "Q: Can I receive local or push notifications to my email address?

When advertising identifier is used does the App functionality will change? Will the App functions properly when the iPad/iPhone is resetted.\n\nA: UDID, which stands for Unique Device Identifier, is an alphanumeric string associated to Apple's iOS running Devices. Due to it's potential for abuse and privacy issues, Apple replaced it with the Advertising Identifier which is a: \n\nnon-permanent, non-personal, device identifier, that advertising networks will use to give you more control over advertisers’ ability to use tracking methods. If you choose to limit ad tracking, advertising networks using the Advertising Identifier may no longer gather information to serve you targeted ads.\n\nThis AdID is used for advertising purposes and does not changes the functionality of the App in any way. It can even be disabled. Reseting it, though, may mean that you'll be receiving less accurate ads. \nWith iOS 6.1 a button was added to reset the Advertising Identifier, so that future requests will return a different value.\n", "Q: iMac display sleep I program my iMac to put the display to sleep after 10 mins.

When I click the link, the OS plays the MP3 with a full screen image of a generic image:\n\nIs it possible to show album art in this view? I've embedded album art in the MP3 file, but it doesn't show up so I'm wondering if I'm doing something wrong with the sound creation tool or if there is something special that needs to be done with how the file is hosted.\nHas anyone seen a song that plays from a web page with album artwork?\n\nA: I'm just guessing here, but have you tried using an AAC-file with either that or Apple's M4A-extension? You could also try use the MP4-extension and see if it thinks the artwork is a frame from a video-file.\n\nA: Sadly it cannot be done. The generic image which mentioned is just an indication that the music is being played by QuickTime plugin and you cannot change it to the music's artwork.\nIf you really want to see the artwork while playing the music, you need to use an application on your server side so that the application plays it, such as available media players which usually use Flash to provide such features.\nHope it helps you.\nGood Luck ;)\n\nA: This can be done quite easily! You just have to embed the album art into the .mp3, which can be done with itunes and a special script.\nFollow this guide: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oClIT8f6V7E\nScript download: http://dougscripts.com/itunes/scripts/ss.php?sp=embedart\n\nA: This is quite an easy thing to do.

This exact same SSD was previously used to boot a 2011 Mac Book Pro (model ID 8,2), connected to the same 2 displays, and running in closed-lid mode, and this problem did not occur.\nThe only differences are in hardware:\na) Now using a late-2012 Mac Mini 6,2 instead of a MacBookPro8,2 as the CPU.\nb) 2nd display now attached through an HDMI --> DVI converter dongle. Previously it was attached through a Newer-brand USB --> DVI adapter.\nAnother bit of info -- if I quickly sleep-wake the display, before the display has a chance to actually complete its \"go to sleep / power off\" mode changes, the problem does not occur. Only happens if I let >5 seconds go by, long enough for the external display to go to sleep.\n\nA: I'm guessing the 2nd display is not an Apple display.  \nI believe what is happening is that the display is, in fact, going to sleep, but in such a way that the Mac thinks it has been powered off.  \nReplacing the  HDMI --> DVI converter with an Apple Thunderbolt --> DVI converter is your best bet at fixing this. \n", "Q: iMessage delivery status different on iPhone and iPad?

Here's an interesting one: ALL my interface icons have disappeared since my rebooting my MacBook from safe sleep (the battery had died).

Press Option-Command-Escape or select \"Force Quit\" from the Apple menu, and then select and quit the Finder. The Finder will relaunch automatically, and hopefully show the icons properly loaded.\n\n2) If the problem persists, it's time to clear the caches. There are different ways to accomplish this. The easiest and less error prone is to use a free maintenance utility, like Onyx for Mac, from Titanium Software. Onyx is an old school Macintosh application and will do this (and much more) for you. It's free as in beer and it's very easy to use. \nIf you feel like you want to pay for an utility, I have the fantastic Cocktail, which I brought a long time ago and I only use \"every now and then\" when I have a problem like this. I haven't compared both (or any of the other alternatives) but they usually do the same stuff under different user interfaces. Cocktail releases periodic updates and the UI is clean and nice, but other than that, any utility will do.\nSince I don't have Onyx installed right now, I'll show you how you could do this with Cocktail:\nIn Files -> Caches -> select all like in the sshot:\n\nThen go to Options and select all:\n\nand finally also select all these: \n\nfinally… click ok and in the first screen click Clear.\nIt will take a while.

I purchased Mountain Lion from the App Store and installed it, and it worked fine for awhile. Recently my machine crapped out and my disk was corrupted pretty bad, and I had to reset to factory settings, so I'm on Lion again.\nWhen I go to the App Store, Mountain Lion is there, but it wants me to pay the 20 bucks again. I originally bought it from the App Store, so I would have thought it would have remembered me, but I guess not.\nIs there any way to get it back, short of contacting Apple for support?\n\nA: From Personal Experience: I believe it's the same for everyone. It is the only item in the Mac App Store that doesn't show purchased even though it is purchased, even in UK, however I don't think they would make you pay for it again as it is linked to your account. You could call them and ask them or ask a Genius in store, I would just to be sure you don't get billed again for it, even though you shouldn't.\n\nA: When you run App Store and go to Purchases, is OS X Mountain Lion listed at all? If so, what's its status?\nIf not, it sounds like you'll need to contact Apple Support. When you purchased Mountain Lion, they emailed you a receipt that includes the order id number and date of purchase, so getting this straightened out with them should be easy.\nNote: The email sender is iTunes Store, not App Store, and the subject will include only a receipt number, not \"Mountain Lion receipt\" or the like. Search your email for \"OS X Mountain Lion\" and you should find it straightaway.\nIf you deleted that email, and the App Store doesn't list Mountain Lion as purchased, you might be out of luck. Contacting Apple in this case is unavoidable. Good luck.\n\nA: In my experience, Apple does preserve your purchase of Mountain Lion in the App Store. In face, I'm pretty sure that you can install it on multiple machines with one account. If you purchased it successfully, it should be there. I would definitely contact Apple; there's no need to pay again.\nBy the way, I'd double-check my assertion about the Mountain Lion purchase personally, but my ISP doesn't let me connect to the App Store for some reason...\n", "Q: Are DropBox files viewed on iOS devices taking up space on them? When travelling I will need all of the \"space\" I can claim on my iPad. Am I correct in thinking \"space\" is not being taken up on the iPad by DB folders, unless I have made them favorites?\n\nA: I think they cache them locally cause sometimes I'm able to view the images in my folders even while I'm offline but those files aren't on my Favorites.\n\nA: I contacted DropBox in relation to this. The files will only stay on the device itself in the sandbox area if they are favourited. If not, they will load into the memory and be dropped from memory once the application closes. Because they are cloud-based, they are \"read\" then \"dropped\" once no longer being \"read\". Kind of like a while loop in programming.\nSource: DropBox technical support\n\nA: Yes.  The files are cloud based until you favorite them.\nStraight from DropBox:\n\nHow much can I store on my phone or tablet?\nThe Dropbox iPhone app can save as many files as your iPhone or iPod\nTouch can hold or Dropbox space allows. If you find yourself running\nout of space on your iPhone, removing files from your Favorites list\nwill clear up space on your device. If you're running out of Dropbox\nspace, you can delete files from your Dropbox, or you might want to\nconsider upgrading to a bigger Dropbox.\n\n\nA: If marked as favourite then on iPad/iPod/iPhone\nLooking at file means that it is temporarily downloaded  to view until application is closed, then it is removed.\n\nA: I have the Dropbox app on my iPhone and have closed and opened it multiple times, as well as resetting the phone, since getting a notice that my phone is nearly full, and Dropbox is taking up 3.9 GB of space without anything being selected as a favorite. Therefore it would appear that the files to take up space without being selected as favorite.\n\nA: Actually there is a software called iFunBox http://www.i-funbox.com that allows you to \"Manage App Data\".\nI noticed my DropBox app was taking 3.6 GB (99% data). Now I just used iFunBox to delete 3,6 GB of \"uploads\" from DropBox, and it shrunk again - works like a charm. And DropBox also correctly recovered - picked up to upload my camera folder at the correct place.\n\nA: The best and the easiest way to release the dropbox memory is that you unlink your cell phone and then linked again... I have like 1.9 Gb (the same as the photo and video files) I try this and inmidiatlly the memory was clean... the best part is when you linked again you not have to reload your files...\n\nA: Actually it saves everything on your harddrive. I just came to realize I only had 2GB of free space on my iPad. I downloaded iFunbox on my PC and with it I discovered that pretty much every file I've ever downloaded had a copy in a Cache folder under the Dropbox app directory. A couple of those files had even more copies because I had opened them multiple times. I deleted every file on my dropbox cache and recovered 12GB of free space on my 32GB ipad. \n\nA: Just freed up about 8gb on my iPhone! If you're running low on memory just delete Dropbox & then re-install it. Apparently stuff you either upload,download, or view still gets stuck or cached in the local Dropbox app on your iPhone. Note to Dropbox: Fix this! I thought I had a virus or something for the last 2 months!

I need to use Ruby 1.9 for a programming test, and I'll be borrowing my dad's MacBook Air to do so. He's running OSX 10.7.5 and has Ruby 1.8.7\nWhat's the least \"invasive\" way to install a newer version of Ruby on his machine. Do I have to install XCode? Do I have to install RVM? Would homebrew be useful for this? If so, is it relatively simple to remove them once I'm done? I'd like to return it \"clean\" and avoid making any unnecessary changes to his system. It would be ideal if I could undo/uninstall any changes I do make.\nThanks for your help!\n\nA: The problem is that there aren't any builds for Ruby for OS X, so you'll have to at least install the Command Line Tools for Xcode to be able to build it. But once you've done that, you might as well use any of Homebrew, RVM or rbenv to install Ruby, rather than building it yourself.\nI don't think there's any major difference in terms of how easy it is to remove either of these tools, since they were all designed to be standalone and as little intrusive as possible. In fact, RVM and rbenv live in one folder only.\nThe choice is yours.\n\nWith Homebrew\nI would say the easiest way of getting Ruby is through Homebrew. Note that Homebrew has Ruby 2.0.0 as of writing this answer, so you won't get 1.9.3 through it.\nruby -e \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/mxcl/homebrew/go)\"\nbrew install ruby\n\nHomebrew and everything it installs lives in /usr/local. You can use this gist to remove it completely – just copy and paste it to a Terminal. Although I would say having Homebrew on a Mac is never a bad idea, which is the reason I'd recommend this over the other methods.\n\nWith RVM\nRVM is a little more intrusive in the way it interoperates with your shell, but if you're going to remove it after, then you shouldn't worry about it. \nInstall RVM by following the instructions. For 1.9.3, you then just need:\nrvm install 1.9.3\n\nNote that in order to use RVM you would have to change your shell's configuration file (.bash_profile) as well, so remember to clean that up afterwards. Apart from that, RVM lives in ~/.rvm, and can be uninstalled with rvm implode.\n\nWith rbenv\nrbenv is a competitor to RVM, and does the same thing. Except that if you want to install Rubies you need ruby-build as a plugin.\nFollow its installation guide and once you're done, use rbenv install 1.9.3-p392 for the latest 1.9.3 patchlevel, for example.\nTo remove rbenv, you only have to delete ~/.rbenv and remove the line that loads it from ~/.bash_profile.\n", "Q: How long (time/duration) should a complete restore on an iMac from Time Machine take? I was getting long boot times when I would log onto my account and even my kids' accounts on my iMac (2008 Intel Core 2 Duo).

My HDD is 500GB but that seems like an excessive amount of time.\nWhat would be the usual time range?\nI started it last night, but it came back to the \"Language option\" as if it restarted the disk.\nIdeas?\n\nA: After reading some Apple support threads on this topic, I found a hopeful tip that (for some reason) connecting the TM drive before launching Time Machine System Restore limits you to USB 1 speeds (and thence multi-day time estimates), but attaching it after gives you full USB 2 speed.  \nAfter suffering through about 1% of a backup estimated at 60+ hours to complete, I tried this and it indeed the projection is much better.\n", "Q: Can we have two iCloud accounts on our iPad?

You can even use all of the other services like contacts, reminders or notes.\n\nFollow these steps to add another iCloud account:\n(I took the screenshots on an iPhone, but it is smiliar to your iPad)\n\n\n*\n\n*Open “Settings” app on your homescreen\n\n\n*Scroll down to “Mail, Contacts, Calendars” and tap on it\n\n\n*You see a list of your accounts, scroll down and tap on “Add Account…”\n\n\n*Choose “iCloud” and enter your data\n \n\n*Finished\n", "Q: When creating a RAID 1 mirror set, do you need to have both disks available or can one be added later? I'm planning my transition to Mac OS and I have a pair of mirrored drives I would like to move to my future computer. Since they are currently formatted as NTFS they will need to be reformatted during the transition. What I would like to do is create a RAID 1 mirror set with only one of the drives, copy the data from one drive to the other, and then add the remaining drive to the RAID set. Does anyone know if this is possible to do, or will Disk Utility require me to have two drives to create the RAID 1 mirror set?\n\nA: This can be done from the Disk Utility app or from the diskutil command line.  Be warned that you should definitely make a backup before doing anything.  I had an issue where the diskutil appleraid enable mirror disk1s2  command I ran wrapped the volume in a RAID set but the partition is now called Apple_RAID_Offline and no longer accessible.  Ironically after restoring from backup to a new volume (I'm still trying to figure out if I can recover that original), I was able to create the one-sided mirror just using the Disk Utility.app.  I simply dragged the volume into the RAID window and it gave me a warning that it would be changing the volume to a RAID set but that the data would not be lost.  Not sure what happened with the command line attempt but it's slightly disturbing.  In either case once the one-sided mirror is created you should be able to drag another partition into the Mirrored RAID set to complete the mirror.  or use the diskutil ar add member <disk> <RAIDset> command.  \nIn your case it should be easy to create the one sided mirror first and then transfer your data to the new volume and then format the ntfs disk and add it to the mirror set.  \n\nA: I have done this in Disk Utility.  I created a mirror raid, and gave it one disk.  Later I added a second disk to it, and left the computer be for 12 hours while it rebuilt the array.\nOpen Disk Utility.  Click on the solitary raid drive (not the file system) Click on the RAID button, not the First Aid button in the panel.\nNow drag a new disk the same size into the big panel.  Click rebuild.  It will ask for confirmation.  Rebuilding takes a longggg time -- several times as long as just copying would.\nNote:  The new drive must be as large or larger.  There is no tolerance here. I had a seagate and samsung drive, both nominally 500G.  The seagate was a few sectors smaller.  Could NOT add it to the raid.\nNote:  The new drive has to have a file system on it.  You'd think it wouldn't matter, as everything is going to be overwritten, but the rebuild fails quickly if it doesn't have a file system.\nNote:  The + - button at the bottom refers to adding/deleting a raid set.\n", "Q: OS X unusably unresponsive after upgrading 10.6 to 10.8 Every other click and keystroke seems to cause my MacBook to just freeze for minutes at a time.\n(I saw How to fix OS X Lion being unresponsive? but I'm not seeing much swap activity nor is my RAM filled up, according to the Activity Monitor.)\nAt this point I'd just like to salvage my data off the machine so I can do a clean reinstall, which hopefully will address the problem.  But it's taking forever to do anything, even bring up a menu/Finder or type in \"terminal.\"\nI guess my questions boil down to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ideally, is there a service/process/etc. that I should disable/stop/kill?  (If I can even get to it....)  I don't see any processes consuming much CPU/RAM, so I have no candidates to kill.  Is there a service that I should be disabling?  I'm new to OS X so I'm not sure how to debug this issue.\n\n*Otherwise, is there any way for me to at least get a \"bare minimum\" system up so that I can copy my files off, and perhaps run a few applications so as to export certain data that aren't neatly available for copying off as files?  Should I be rescuing via a live CD (which means I won't be able to run OS X applications to export data but if that's the only option then so be it)?  What would be a good live CD for this - Ubuntu?\nThanks.\n\nA: Ultimately I discovered that there exists a Safe Mode, which you can access by pressing and holding Shift after the gray boot screen appears. In this mode the system was responsive again, and I could actually copy my data off.\nThere also exists a more restrictive Recovery Mode, which you can access by pressing and holding Command+R, and you can use Disk Utility there to copy entire disks around. However, that wasn't necessary for me (until it came time to wipe out and reinstall the OS).\n", "Q: Why does my MBP sleep on Mountain Lion and often not wake up I recently upgraded my Macbook Pro late 2010 to Mountain Lion (from Snow Leopard). Now it has this problem where it will sometimes sleep and not wake up. However, I hear that the computer is still on, since the fan is spinning, and so is the hard drive.\nThis happens intermittently, and I can't seem to isolate conditions of when it sleeps and wakes up, versus sleeps and doesn't. The battery is fine in all scenarios. Sometimes this happens when the MBP is plugged in.\nThe one constant thing I notice is when I close the lid, the front light will remain lit (but when it sleeps, the light will flash slowly). Then when I lift the lid, this light will go out.\nThe only way to get it to snap out of this \"fake sleep\" is to hold the power button until it shuts off, then start the computer again.\nWhat's going on, and how do I fix it?\nEDIT: This describes what I'm going through. Also this question, which has no answer.\n\nA: I had a similar problem with my late 2012 MacBook Pro. It wouldn't wake after a long sleep: black screen but system running (I could access it via SSH).\nBefore trying any solution, I recommend you to reset the SMC and check if the problem persists.\nAlso run pmset -g in Terminal (it won't change or break anything) and take note of your current settings.\nI solved this problem disabling hibernation, which was introduced by Apple with a firmware upgrade. I did this by running this command in Terminal:\nsudo pmset -a autopoweroff 0\n\nTo reset the original setting:\nsudo pmset -a autopoweroff 1\n\nThe autopoweroff option is undocumented by Apple (doesn't appear in man pmset); it seems to be related with the \"Deep Sleep\" mode.\n", "Q: Macbook Air not detecting correct external display resolution My Macbook Air stopped detecting the resolution of my external display this morning and I'm not sure why because it was working fine last night.

Solution was to reset the SMC (as per idownloadblog):\n\n\n*\n\n*Power off computer\n\n*Press and hold altogether left Shift Ctrl Alt and the power button for a couple of seconds.\n\n*Wait nervously for what feels like ages.\n\n*Press the power button. Probably nothing happens.\n\n*Wait even longer and avoid biting fingernails\n\n*Press the power button.\n\n*Hear startup chime with great relief.\n\n*When computer comes back up the display may still be zoomed, but if you go to the display preferences you should now be able to find a resolution that works (previously, for me, the correct display resolution was not available for the external display).\n\n\nA: On my MacBook Pro with OS X 10.8.3 I have a configuration file for each external display I connected to my Mac in this folder: /Library/ColorSync/Profiles/Displays. If you can identify the file for your display from that list, try moving the file to a different folder and reconnecting your monitor.

Are there any possible ill consequences from booting my 2007 MacBook Pro (runs 10.8.3) into 10.4.11? According to Apple it's supported. I just want to run Diablo 2.\nI found an old backup of my PowerBook G3 and if dd works right (asr strangely refuses to do it), I'll have a partition which can boot either machine, complete with a System Folder.\nBut I don't want this to affect or corrupt my real filesystem.\n\nA: As long as you're not using FileVault it won't be a big problem.  If you are using FileVault or encrypted drives in Mountain Lion then Tiger won't be able to read them but even then it won't cause damage as long as you don't erase them when Tiger complains that they are unreadable. \nSpotlight works differently in Mountain Lion so Tiger's spotlight and Mountain Lion's Spotlight will each have to reindex all your drives when you switch back and forth but that just takes time, it's not permanently damaging. \nThe riskiest part is trying to create a dual-boot disk.  \n", "Q: in Ipod touch 4 (ios version 5.0.1), Is there a way to view volume as numbers and not as a slider?

I made an OS X 10.6 USB stick and I used it to succesfully install OS X on several Mac, including a very old Mac Mini and a MacBook Pro.\nHowever I've got a problem: on my girlfriend's Mac it simply doesn't work.\nWhen I hold ALT when the system boots up, I can see the harddrive icon (so I take it that pressing ALT does indeed work) and hence decide to boot from the harddrive, but I don't see the \"Recovery HD\" nor the USB stick / \"EFI boot\" icons.  The only choice is get is \"harddrive\".\nI tried again on my Mac Mini and surely enough: I can hold ALT and I see all the icons.\nI also tried again on my MacBookPro (very old 17\" MBP, the first 17\" one if I remember correctly) and once again, I can hold ALT and I see the \"EFI boot\" icon.\nWhy doesn't my girlfriend's MacBook recognize the USB stick (and hence prevents my from reinstalling the system)?\nThe strange thing is that as far as I can tell my girlfriend's MacBook is more recent than both my MacMini and my MacBook Pro.\n\nA: If her MacBook was shipped with Lion, you couldn't be able to boot with a Snow Leopard stick. Apple Knowledge Base states that you shouldn't use earlier versions of OS X:\n\nNote: You should not use a version of Mac OS X that is earlier\n  (\"older\") than the version your Mac shipped with.\n\nIf this is the case, you have to create a bootable Lion stick.\n\nA: It may depend on the exact version of 10.6.x you have.  The \"general\" OSX install disc that Apple sold (not tied to any specific hardware) only includes 10.6.3; but, later models were pre-installed with 10.6.7, and they will not boot from the 10.6.3 DVD or USB.\nYou can use http://www.appleserialnumberinfo.com/Desktop/index.php to find out what OS the computer was originally shipped with.  \n", "Q: Command-delete shortcut is not working for me How do you delete a file you have selected in a Finder window, without using the mouse?\ndelete doesn't do it.\nWhen I looked it up, I was said that command-delete is supposed to do it, but it doesn't work for me.\n\nA: It should work in Finder by default, but did you press the right delete key?\n\n\n*\n\n*Delete (⌫) is the key that is called backspace on other platforms\n\n*Forward delete (⌦) is the key that is called delete on other platforms\n\n\nA: *\n\n*Look into \"System Preferences → Keyboard keys\" and make sure Command is enabled and mapped to the Cmd key.

This was driving me crazy because I use ⌘-delete frequently, and I often switch between the iMac and my MacBook Air (running the same version of OS X) on which ⌘-delete works fine. I just discovered by chance and desperation that, for some reason, ⌘-⌥-delete (command-option-delete) does work. It's not as good as having the same keystrokes work on both machines, but at least now there's some keyboard shortcut I can use on the iMac.\nUPDATE: For no apparent reason, ⌘-delete has started working.\n\nA: I had the same problem. Later I discovered that it was my own mistake. But also a mistake from Apple. On the extended keyboard with numeric pad there is a button says DELETE. (It's not on the short wireless keyboard) This is NOT the delete button for the combination Cmd-Delete. You have to use the button with the backarrow! So Cmd-Backarrow.\n\nA: I experience that before. and my accidental solution is command + delete after that press command + backspace.\n\nA: This may not help many, but here is how I restored \"Command+delete\". \nA while back, I was convinced that this key combination for \"Move to Trash\" was not working in my macOS Sierra. So, in System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > App Shortcuts, I attempted to manually define a shortcut \"Move to Trash\". But, I was never allowed to assign the same \"Command+delete\" key combination.\nA frustrating few weeks have passed until this morning. But, this morning, I was determined to restore \"Command+delete\" and once again went into the App Shortcuts pane. There, it occurred to me to DELETE the very shortcut and key combination I had been trying to define. So, I selected my \"Move to Trash\" Finder shortcut and clicked on the \"minus\" button to delete it.\nUpon returning to the Finder, I was stunned to see \"Command+delete\" appearing to the right of \"Move to Trash\" again.\nSo, if you have tried many things to restore the \"Command+delete\" key combination for \"Move to Trash\", one thing I would like for you to try is this:\n\n\n*\n\n*In System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > App Shortcuts, create a Finder shortcut for \"Move to Trash\" and assign whatever key combination that the system accepts.\n\n*Go back to the Finder and confirm that your key combination works.\n\n*Now, return to the App Shortcuts pane, select the shortcut you created, and press the \"minus\" sign to delete the shortcut.\n\n*Go back to the Finder and see if \"Command+delete\" has return to \"Move to Trash.\n\n\nA: For Macs (Macbooks only) using Logitech MX series, perm delete shortcut is: Cmd+Opt+Del (macOS is Monterey v12.X)\n\nA: I accidentally discovered that Fn + Delete did the job for me in macOS Sierra.\n\nA: Command-backspace seems to work.  But lots of confusion is caused by the fact that Apple insists on being \"special\" when it comes to backspace and delete keys.\nLet's be clear, the ASCII standard has a BS (ASCII code 08) and DEL (ASCII code 127).\nMost keyboards have both a key labelled Backspace, and a key labelled Delete.  (Or something similar.)\nMost systems (Windows, Linux, etc.) interpret the Backspace key to mean \"Delete the character left of the cursor,\" and Delete means \"Delete the character under, or to the right of, the cursor\".\nOn my mabook pro keyboard (which I almost never use), there is only a Delete key.  It functions as the rest of the universe expects Backspace to work.\n\nA: CmdOptBkSp did it for me for macOS Monterey with a 101+ keyboard.\n", "Q: Software to horizonally flip (not rotate) OSX's monitor output? For display reasons we've got a setup where a user watches videos on a MacBook via a mirror.  Of course, this works okay for videos normally, but the user would like to be able to do more than watch videos, including play some games and read comics and the like.\nSince the user views the display though a mirror (there are disability issues around this - I'm aware it's a relatively odd question) obviously the text is backwards. Is it possible to horizonally flip OS X's output? Either to the main screen or a external monitor? At the moment it looks like two mirrors is going to be the only solution and that's going to be tricky to arrange.\nTo be clear - I'm trying to flip horizontally, not rotate by 180 degrees. So the Apple menu is in the top right and the spotlight Notification Center are top left. \nPlease indicate/edit and OS version requirements in your answer.\n\nA: I realize how old this is, but the answer is VLC player. I have an El Capitan Macbook 13\". Open VLC, then Window - Video Effects - Geometry - Transform. From there you can rotate 90/180/270, flip horizontally or vertically, magnify, clone etc. Perfect if you have a p/w locked no remote garage sale projector like mine. \n\nA: It looks like Open Broadcaster Softare (OBS) can do this. https://obsproject.com/\nI haven't tried it in production yet. In my testing environment I have three displays. I use a Display Capture source with input from my laptop screen. I run whatever I need on the teleprompter there. I use a 24\" HDMI monitor as my primary display for managing OBS, audio apps, etc. I use a VGA 32\" monitor for the teleprompter. I tell OBS to send my output to the \"projector\" via the miniDisplay->VGA adapter. Add Transform -> Flip Horizontal, and voila! My laptop screen is displayed to the 32\" monitor with a horizontal flip. (It's mirrored and it's mirrored. :)  )\nI'm not actually broadcasting anything with OBS. I'm just using its Flip Horizontal filter to artificially mirror my laptop display to the teleprompter display. CPU usage by OBS is relatively low, since it's not having to broadcast anything It's ONLY mirroring the display.\n\nA: SwitchResX (paid) provides the exact functionality your are looking for. It allows you to horizontally flip the display output.\nThis mirror image feature is hidden in the current version because it no longer works consistently across all new macs. You can option-click the menu icon to see all the hidden features, including this one\n\nA: There is a free macOS utility from Teleprompter Mirror that will horizontally flip any selected window of a macOS app.\nUnfortunately it significantly reduces the frame rate as it is continuously capturing window contents and drawing the flipped version over it. Tested on a macBook pro 13\" (model 2017 with T1 chip) and latest macOS Monterey 12 Beta.

The messages came through on the thread messages that my ex partner has previously sent but not as an iMessage it's causing great confusion how it has been done.\nBasically, I don't get how things work so I can know if it's something I can change or if it's just the sender messing up. How can I verify my device is receiving only my messages? \n\nA: I would sign out of iMessage on the device and ensure the carrier is only sending messages to that phone number.\nOnce you've ruled out SMS to the old and new number being delivered, you can re-enable iMessage and test Apple's delivery to that phone.\nIt's almost certainly a problem with the sender's address book having wrong numbers, but removing and then adding iMessage should clear any mistaken routing if that was the cause.\n", "Q: Print from iPad without AirPrint or Wi-Fi Consider the following configuration\n\n\n*\n\n*I have a Wi-Fi iPad without 3G support. \n\n*I also have an HP printer that doesn't not have Wi-Fi capabilities.\n\n*My printer supports USB.\n\n*I am planning to buy a 3G Wi-Fi Router.\n\n\nI understand, in order to print from my iPad to a printer I need an AirPrint-compatible printer. I am also aware that for certain selected printers (let say mine is one of those privilege) you can use iOS Apps from OEM such that you can print from your iPad. But even to use it, I need a Wi-Fi enabled printer.\nI am planning to purchase a 3G Wi-Fi router so that I can connect my iPad outside a Wi-Fi network. \nNow from here I was wondering, if I can use such a 3G Wi-Fi router which suppose has a USB Port to connect my printer and provide me the option to print from my iPad?\nNote\nI am not sure if this question fits in Ask Different as my target device is an Apple Device but even then there is more than that this question would cover. So in case if you feel this question fits there, feel free to migrate.\n\nA: To print to your HP printer using AirPrint you will need some kind of AirPrint server.  It is not enough to just get network connectivity to the printer, you need some software running somewhere to handle some of the communication details.  It is conceivable that someone makes a 3G WiFi router that includes AirPrint support but I think is unlikely. \nProbably your best bet is to run AirPrint software on the computer that is connected to the HP printer so that computer can act as the AirPrint server.  You can get NetGear Genie for free (though I removed it because the version I used with the OS version I was running caused my computer to crash with kernel panics, but maybe that's fixed now) or something like handyPrint (never tried it).\n\nA: Use the HP App \"HP ePrint\" it works like a charm. First you must  connect the  HP printer to the router and share it on your network. \"HP Printer Control\" is also a nice App to add. This should solve your issue.\n\nA: I purchased this router for around 20 dollars, and installed TomatoUSB to it. (Many routers support it, just make sure you find one that does):\nhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0045HG53K/ref=oh_details_o01_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc=1\nAnd then followed these instructions to install AirPrint to the router:\nhttp://blog.qnology.com/2013/03/tutorial-apple-airprint-on-tomatousb.html \nI'm able to print from my iDevices that are on the wifi, my other computers on wifi, and that tutorial also includes instructions to install Cloudprint, through which I'm able to print from anywhere.\nTomatoUSB will work with lots of routers, just make sure the one you want to buy will support it before you buy. \n\nA: Use the app called PrintnShare on your iPad. Although it will print to all wifi printers, it will also print to your USB printer via your computer. Note the iPad does not support printing over a usb cable direct from the iPad to a printer. It will also support adhoc network and 3G printing.\n\nA: (not sure this kind of solution is of interest to the OP but it might be to someone).\nIf you have OpenWrt installed in your router, you can make it advertise and serve an old printer as an AirPrint capable printer by using these packages:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you do not know what OpenWrt is, then perhaps that is not for you;\n\n*btw, I am the author of the above OpenWrt package feed.\n\n\nA: If you don't have an AirPrint compatible printer you can use the app, Print Hub, which supports printing every filetype I've tried, has the option to connect to Dropbox, lets you edit photos before printing and it's only $0.99!\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/app/print-hub/id612603224?mt=8\n", "Q: Can't delete iCloud account from Mail, Contacts, Calendars When trying to log into iCloud from System Preferences, I'm told\n\n[appleid] is already signed in to iCloud\nTo use this as your primary iCloud account, delete it from Mail, Contacts, \n  and Calendars and sign in again.\n\nHowever, I can't delete the account from Mail, Contacts and Calendars.

Upgrading to more RAM should speed things up substantially.\nSnow Leopard, when booted up to the Finder, takes approximately 2GB of RAM to run (that is if no apps are loaded and running). Mountain Lion, however, takes approximately 3.5GB of RAM in the same situation. When you start running apps, including Safari or any web browser, the amount of memory needed by the system goes considerably above these amounts. If your Mac has less than 4GB of physical RAM, then Mountain Lion is going to use the \"swap file\" to constantly write pages in and out of RAM and to the hard drive, which is going to slow down your system operation considerably. \nIf your system will support it, it will run much faster if you can upgrade with more RAM. According to this chart, your model of Mac can accommodate 8GB, 12GB or 16GB of RAM (confirm the exact model number to be sure), so you should consider upgrading.\n", "Q: how to set CSV delimiter in OSX Lion?

Generally, it works pretty well, but on a somewhat consistent basis messages that I've sent from the Mac will disappear, but only disappear on the Mac. They stay on my phone. It's not a huge deal, but I sometimes like to go review messages via my Mac. Any suggestions?\n\nA: In the messages prefs, under the messages tab do you have the \"save history when conversations are closed\" checked or not?\nI generally don't close my conversations so I haven't lost any of my messages but if you regularly close them then this might be the option to check, if you haven't already done so.\nAlso if you have your main (Apple ID) account listed at the top of all your accounts, and make sure that you have your mobile number listed as the \"start new conversations from:\" section this, hopefully should solve your problems.\nI use messages for iMessage and for Facebook chat but it is also set up for gmail...\nHope that helps\n", "Q: Can Apple TV AirPlay mirroring use a \"secondary\" screen/display? Can Apple TV enable me to treat my TV as a wireless secondary screen (as one can do when directly connecting the TV via a cable), rather than simply mirroring my primary screen?  I'd love to stream content to the TV while still using my laptop to do work.\n(I know you can stream iTunes to the TV but that's very limited in what it can stream/play, e.g. can't stream content from arbitrary video websites.)\n\nA: iPad 2 + Air Display. http://avatron.com/apps/air-display\nUse Air Display to turn your iPad into a second monitor (totally cool in itself!), and then mirror your iPad to your apple tv. \nOR, if you, like me, only have an iPad 1, then you can use your iPad as the main monitor and mirror your laptop screen. \nEither way, you end up with three screens going, two of them the same.\nThat's the only way I know. Seems crazy that Apple can't come out with an update that allows the apple tv to be a second, rather than mirrored, screen. \n\nA: Just go to System Preferences, then Displays, and deselect \"mirroring\", then you can use your laptop screen for work while watching something on the tv. You may not be able to full screen the video without blacking out your laptop, but you can just maximize the video window.\n", "Q: Carbon copy cloner to image OS X lion and restore from disk image Is it possible to create an image of my 64gb 2012 Macbook Air using Carbon Copy Cloner so that I can recover from that image (if my Mac does not boot) even if I am not connected to the internet?\n\nA: The getting started section of the CCC online documentation will get you on your way.\nFor Carbon Copy Cloner support, please post questions to the Bombich Software Help Desk\n", "Q: Start XQuartz automatically on X11 app launch Before switcthing to Mac OSX 10.8 everytime I launch application which uses x11 it was starting x11 automatically.\nAfter switching to XQuartz and 10.8 it does not work anymore and I have to launch XQuartz manually. \nHow to launch XQuartz on demand?\n\nA: I was having the same problem. Quitting XQuartz and deleting ~/.Xauthority resolved the issue for me.  I got the idea to do this from the Mountain Lion, Xquartz, and (lost) autostart thread in the Apple Mailing List. Other suggestions from that thread include:\n\n\n*\n\n*Logging out and then back in after installing XQuartz.\n\n*Ensuring that the $DISPLAY variable is being set by by launchd and not clobbered by your shell scripts (see http://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/wiki/X11-UsersFAQ#sshXforwardingdebugging)\n\n\nA: I don't have to launch xQuartz, I just use Terminal and ssh -Y user@IP.  Then X emulation appears to be available as I can launch X windows from the server.\n\nA: I know this is an old question, but it's still occasionally relevant - so here's a different (but likely obscure) scenario that can lead to this.\nBecause zsh isn't always installed on (non Mac) systems, I've been in the habit of leaving bash as my default shell with an entry in .bash_profile which does exec zsh -l if zsh exists. This turned out to be the cause of XQuartz not auto launching in my case (even though I could manually start it from the command line) - likely because $DISPLAY wasn't set correctly in bash.\nOnce I switched my Mac shell to zsh, XQuartz will now auto launch when I run an X11 app locally or remotely.\n", "Q: Alternative Large Cursors and show tooltips I need to use large cursors when using OSX.\nHowever the standard Apple ones I can choose in System Preferences all make the cursor expand to the right and down. These then hide the beginning of any tooltip (especially in web browsers) and in some programs they hide needed information.\nI already use OmniDazzle to be able to find the cursor (and have used Pinpoint in the past) - it highlights the area the cursor is in but it does not change the cursor icon so it does not help me.\nAre there any cursors or any way to expand the cursor in other directions so I can still read the tooltips?\n\nA: You can make custom cursors with a graphics program and apply them using Pinpoint. Here's the relevant video on how it's done. \n\nA: I think Mouseposé or PinPoint will help you out by providing a  highlight around a normal size cursor that isn't opaque like the normal cursor so you can still read the tooltips.  They're not free, but it may be your only option.\n", "Q: Where is the Volume Control in an iPod Touch? I have an iPod touch for my teen who continues to put the volume on high.

I've got a Mac Pro 4,1.\nI had two KVR1066D3Q8R7S/8G planks in it and it ran on 1066 Mhz.\nNow I've bought two planks of KVR1066D3Q8R7S/8GI (the same with \"I\" at the end - stands for intel certification). I've got 32 Gbs, but the system says they run at 800Mhz.\nWhy? Is there a way to fix it? Is it because I use four slots instead of a triple setup? Will 3x8Gbs perfom better than 4x8 or is it better to have more RAM?\nUPD1:\nIf I use either three of the sticks, they all run on 1066, when i insert the fourth one, everything drops to 800 Mhz.\nUPD2:\nThat's what I have found here:\n\nSingle-processor \n  computers have four \n  memory slots. Depending \n  on the model, you can \n  install 1 GB, 2 GB DIMMs, \n  or 4 GB DIMMs. \n  The processor’s memory \n  controller has three \n  memory channels. DIMM \n  slots 1 and 2 have their \n  own channels; slots 3 and \n  4 share a channel. \n  For optimal memory \n  bandwidth, all three \n  memory channels should \n  be used, and memory \n  should be balanced across \n  the three channels.\nNote: Populating slot 4 \n  slightly drops maximum \n  memory bandwidth, \n  but depending on the \n  applications used, overall \n  system performance may \n  benefit from the larger \n  amount of memory.\n\nBut it is still confusing. I thought the bandwidth that is being described is overall bandwidth not like all chips are dropping to 800 Mhz... \n\nA: I believe this issue is caused by the fact that the Nehalem based Xeon processor you have is one of the \"Triple Channel\" variants, meaning that when you install the fourth stick of RAM you are forcing the memory into the non-channel diversified mode, similar to using 3 sticks of memory in a dual channel system.\nThis is supported by the fact that you're experiencing the issue only on the 4th stick as well as a fairly large amount of of the supporting documentation surrounding the MacPro and the processor itself.\n\nA: @Gedgar is saying that RAM always runs at the slowest speed available amongst all your chips. I'd suggest this.\nOne stick at a time (8GB should be plenty to boot)\n\n\n*\n\n*put one stick in\n\n*boot the computer\n\n*check speed\n\n*remove the stick\n\n\nrepeat with the second stick and so on.\nI'm expecting you to find a stick that's labeled wrong or not functioning properly and running at a 800mhz... \n", "Q: Can I force finder to open without loading previous files?

My lock button is also broken, so I can't reboot it.\nHow can I power the device up?\n\nA: Plugging a phone into a computer or power source via the usb cable will power it on, even if it is off – your phone is in need of repair or replacement.\nI've seen the apple logo appearing for a few seconds and then phone dying several times with dead phones. I've fixed countless phones, but I don't have a concrete answer for this problem other than it being related to the motherboard in your phone and the solution is a replacement (replacement part more than value of the phone)\n", "Q: How do I make a bash script so that I can drag its input on top of the icon?

My brother switched to an Android phone from an iPhone recently.\nWhen I attempt to text him, it still tries to send those messages as iMessages.\nTwo questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*will he receive these iMessages, and\n\n*if not, how do I default messages to him as texts instead of iMessages?\n\n\nThanks  for any help!\n\nA: Your brother's Apple ID probably still has his phone number associated with it for iMessage. The smoothest way to deal with this is to have him disassociate his phone number from his Apple ID.\nApple has a self-service web site that explains how to accomplish this:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://selfsolve.apple.com/deregister-imessage\nIf that doesn't work, this older KB article has a helpful section \"Unlink a phone number\".\nIf he has other Apple devices (Mac or iPad) that are using his Apple ID, your iMessages may be being delivered there. If none of those devices are available when you send him an iMessage, your phone will eventually offer you the opportunity to resend the message as an SMS or MMS.\nUnfortunately you can't disable iMessage on a per-contact basis.\n\nA: In contacts make sure the label for his number does not say iPhone, if it does change it to mobile. To do this select edit in the upper right corner, tap his number and select mobile. If I understand right this is how the phone knows which to send, iMessage or text.

I want to reset it\n(almost) completely and change it to my girlfriend's Apple ID.\nThe thing is: there are 2 or 3 apps whose data we really don't want to\nloose. They are free apps, so it's trivial to reinstall them under the\nnew account.\nI only need a way of backing up the data of these apps under my Apple\nID and then restoring it under her Apple ID.\nIs there a way to achieve this?\nI'm not trying to transfer purchases or anything like that, just copy\nsome data.\nNOTE: The software needs to be Windows or Linux.\n\nA: You can backup data from apps with a program such as PhoneView (Mac) or iFunBox (Mac & Windows).\n\nBrowse, manage and download most any data saved by App Store apps from your iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch. If you're looking for a quick way to download saved recordings, videos or images from your apps, this is it. Even transfer game high scores between devices. --PhoneView\n\nThis data can then be restored to a new installation of an app under a different Apple ID or even on a different device.\n\nA: Extending @grgarside's answer:\n\n\n*\n\n*Acquire iTools, iFunbox, and a Windows or Mac desktop computer\n\n*Use iTools to backup the apps to desktop\n\n*Uninstall all apps\n\n*change AppleID for App store, iCloud, etc. everywhere on device\n\n*Power off/on cycle\n\n*Reinstall the apps from App store (not from backup!)\n\n*On desktop computer, unzip the .ipa files to a staging area\n\n*With iFunbox, for each application:\n\n\n*\n\n*Manage Files and\n\n*copy Documents and Library from {desktop}\\staging_area\\{app name}\\Container\\ to {i-thing]\\User Applications\\{app name}\\ ...and you should be good to go.\n\n\n\n\nNotes:\nStrictly speaking, you should be able to use iFunbox for everything. However it crashed frequently on my Win7 system so I'm not inclined to use it more than necessary.\n.ipa files are just zip archives with a different extension. You may need to rename .zip in order to extract the contents.\nThe reason for #3 and #6 is that the appleid is welded into the app before it is downloaded and installed. For the same reason we don't use either management app's native restore mechanism.\nIf the device is jailbroken you might be able to use iTools for the whole process. (On the unbroken ipad I was using the iTools file system view did not show the User Application data.)\nThis recipe worked for the half dozen apps I needed to move, but I expect some apps have a more complicated process, e.g. copy X,Y,Z from Documents, but leave behind T,U,V and edit the headers in W,X to the new account into.\n", "Q: Does it matter if I take a photo from within Instagram or import into Instagram? I've begun using Instagram more and more on my iPhone 4S. And typically, I take a photo using the standard Photo app, and then import the photo and process it within the Instagram app.\nBut I'm wondering if there's any reason that I should be taking photos from within the app. In particular, does photo source affect resolution?\n\nA: Often, 3rd party apps that can be used as a camera offer different levels of resolution in which they capture the image. Since Instagram is a widely used, and up-to-date app, I would expect they support the highest resolution offered on your device (disclaimer: I don't use Instagram so I can't check with that app).\nAs long as you have the resolution setting (if available) set as high as possible then you should notice no difference between the built-in camera app and Instagram - you should not lose image quality during import either. \nOtherwise it comes back to personal preference. If you take the images with the built-in camera app, then your photos are automatically in Camera Roll and can be easily saved onto a computer.

Any ideas what this is and how to alleviate it?\n\nA: Now that 10.8.4 is released (build 12E55), it is still there. I've gotten a response from Apple Engineering that this is logged by design.\n\nA: As best I can tell, these are purely diagnostic messages and don't indicate a specific failure and instead are just logging state changes for the audio subsystem.\nIf you wish to suppress those messages to have a clean log, it's quite easy to modify the logging system to not log specific or general messages for certain subsystems. Just edit your question if you don't know how to configure syslog.conf or ask a follow on question if that's your true aim separate from knowing that these are placed there by design.\nYou can also reduce the volume of these messages by determining which programs you are running that call the audio subsystem so often. If you log out of all accounts, you can convince yourself that the log only is reporting actions that your user level software is causing instead of some lower level system event that you cannot control.\n\nA: On build 12E55, I've also been seeing these messages. At first, I downgraded coreaudiod back to 10.8.3's version but after playing with strings and dtruss, I found a way to stop the flood of these messages on my system with the latest coreaudiod (you still see the message once when coreaudiod starts but only then).

Currently it splits albums up by artist, then sorts the album names A-Z. Going through and manually changing the Album Artist will take way to long...\n\nI recently upgraded to iTunes 11 and for the most part I like it. However one issue I have come across (and it would seem many others are in the same boat) is that iTunes is grouping albums by artists. For the most part this is fine, but when it comes to soundtracks and compilations things get hairy...\n\nAs you can see soundtracks for games or movies (eg the Shutter Island or Sin City soundtrack) is a compilation of different songs by various artists and iTunes is displaying albums in A-Z order but grouping them by Artist...\nI've found that you need to set the 'album artist' to something like Soundtrack or Various Artists to get the grouping to work correctly. However this would take hours to do manually!! \nIs there an easy fix for this behavious? Either by automating the Album Artist or by hacking iTunes to display albums grouped by album name?\niTunes 11.0.3\n\nA: In general, you're already using the correct way to sort by album name.  Click \"Music\" then, \"Albums\"\n\nThe problem you're seeing with compilations being shown multiple times for each artist has always been a problem even in older versions of iTunes.  In order to fix this, you'll need to modify the Album Artist field in the track info.\nTo do this, press ⌘+i (Ctrl+i on Windows), then put “VA” into the Album Artist field (Note: using “Various Artists” or any matching string should also work). You can select multiple tracks with ⌘+Click (Ctrl+Click on Windows) to edit many tracks on the same compilation at a time.\n\n\nA: Have you checked the Compilation tag for these albums? Find all the tracks for an album, select them, and press Command-I. Click on the Options tab, then, next to Part of a Complication, select Yes. Click OK.\n\nA: TrinitronX posted a very good answer (similar to Joop's).  I'll TrinironX's answer one step further.  Don't just put \"VA\" in the Album Artist field!  In fact, if you follow Kirk's answer and set the Compilation flag, all of your compilations automatically get grouped together anyway (at least in previous iTunes revs).  In TrinitronX's approach they get grouped together under \"VA\" (or just \"Various\", in the default iTunes approach).\nI prefer to have my compilations comes at the very end of my Artist-based view, so I set to the Album Artist of a compilation called \"Alive Records 2009 Sampler\" to \"Ω Alive Records 2009 Sampler\".  In the Artist view, it sits at the end of my list, after Warren Zevon, and before the \"Badman Records\" compilation.\nFor your Album view, this will also keep the whole Album together, instead of breaking it apart for each combination of \"Artist + Album\".  It looks like individual tracks showing up as albums in your screenshot, but I bet if you had the exact same artist on 2 tracks on 1 of those albumns, they would get grouped together like those 2 tracks are an album.\nAnyway, recommended solution:\n\n\n*\n\n*Turn on the Compilation flag as Kirk suggested\n\n*Set the Album Artist field as several suggested, but\n\n*Set the Album Artist field to something that captures the name of the compilation, and use a leading character like my Omega symbol if you'd like the albums to sort to the end when using the Artist view.\n\n\nHope that helps!\n\nA: Here are my observations:\nFor albums that are a bunch of songs by different people:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ticking \"Part of a compilation\" for all tracks means the album will show up under the Compilations \"artist\" in Song view\n\n*If the Album Artist field is empty \n\n\n*\n\n*in Album view it will sort after all other albums (if sorting by artist) and will have Various Artists listed as the album artist\n\n*in Artist view it will show up in the Compilations \"artist\" and tracks will also show up under their respective artist if that artist has a \"real\" album\n\n\n*If the Album Artist field is actually set to Various Artists\n\n\n*\n\n*in Song view it will show up under a Various Artists artist\n\n*in Album view it will sort in the V's (if sorting by artist)\n\n*in Artist view it will show up under a Various Artists artist and tracks will not show up under their respective artist even if that artist has a \"real\" album\n\n\n\nA: To group by Album Name, select View > View Options... from the menu bar:\n\nThis will present a panel with a drop-down list of available sorting criteria. Select Title to sort all your albums by Album Name:\n\n\nA: I don't know about any hacks for this (you probably could use AppleScript, but I'm not sure). However, I do know of two ways to do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you change your view to List, you can view all your songs, sorted by Album.          \n\n*If you change the view to Artist, you can view all the albums created by that artist, but, if it's made by more than one artist, like some of my Deadmou5, it will show all the artists, and all the songs they are affiliated with.\n\nA: Apparently, the recent iTunes 11.0.3 update fixes this bug. \n\nA: Only Elegent way to get over it is to change the Album Artist.   Quick way of doing this is to go into album view, quicksort by various means to get those in front.  You mention that soundtracks and compilations are mostly to blame.   Use those as your 1st searches.    \nThen Cmd click and of the albums or that are obviously by Various Artists,   cmd-I will allow you to change bunches of them at the same time.\nEven with a huge library this will be quicker than finding some script that screws uo all kinds of other things.\nItunes match seems to have done a descent job of cleaning my metadata as well\n\nA: Hey guys I think the current iTunes is better than ever before and the issue above can be easily sorted out. Try the following when you have a compilation file that you need to view as one album. \n\n\n*\n\n*Open the file in windows highlight all tracks and then right click and select properties. You will now see a read only or hidden attribute - be sure to uncheck the \"READ ONLY\" option. \n\n*now go to iTunes adding the tracks and opening the \"recently added\" view then highlight all tracks and change the info as you require. \n\n*For best results and in order to keep your artist names and album name - change the album artist to \"VA\" adding any art work etc - and you are good to go...enjoy!\n\n", "Q: How to change the document language in Keynote and make the red lines disappear?

What can I do to speed it up just like when it was new?\n\nA: I had a white MacBook with roughly the same specifics (except for a 160 GB HD) and it wouldn't run so slowly.\nYou can try the following software fixes:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to System Preferences -> Users and disable unnecessary login items. These items are executed right after login.\n\n*Go to /Library/StartupItems and disable unnecessary startup items. These items are executed before login, just after boot. This is safe because essential system scripts are not placed there. Don't touch anything in /System/Library, instead.\n\n*Use Activity Monitor and identify third-party daemons and processes that are running in background. Disable/uninstall unnecessary software.\n\n*Open Console and look for unusual error messages.\n\n*Clear ~/Library/Caches and /Library/Caches.\n\n*Check and — if needed – repair your hard drive. You can do this booting with Recovery HD.\n\n*Check and repair permissions with Disk Utility.\n\n*Go to Dashboard and close unnecessary widgets. Some widgets run in background and use system resources.\n\n*Only if you know what you're doing, you could also check third-party kernel extensions.\n\n\nHardware improvements:\n\n\n*\n\n*Buy a SSD. The spinning hard drive is the greatest bottleneck in modern laptops.\n\n*If you're running short of RAM, consider upgrading to 8 GB if your machine supports it (4 GB should be enough, though).\n\n\nA: Buy an SSD (solid state drive), it will speed things up considerably. You can install it yourself.\n\nA: I would try a Repair Disk first. I have seen this drastically speed up slow Macs, and it's free before you spend money on hardware: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1782\n\nA: Have you tried using a system utility like Onyx? \nIt repairs permissions, and all that other fun stuff. There is actually a video about what it does in more detail on mactuts.\nI'm also fairly certain that they have different downloads for the different versions of Mac OS so you should be able to find something that can help you speed up your computer. Programs like Onyx can work to do most (if not all) of the software fixes that pietrodn suggested.\nI also disabled the dashboard using the terminal type the following into the terminal:\ndefaults write com.apple.dashboard mcx-disabled -boolean true\n\nand then type:\nkillall Dock\n\nAlso one thing that helped me speed up my MacBook Pro was moving my iTunes library to an external harddrive. Just a thought but it might help. \n\nA: This very informative article entitled \"Speed Up an Old Mac with These Tricks [Mac OS X]\" written on the 29th May 2013 by J.Bruce for makeuseof.com should provide good insight into what can be achieved including:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disable window animations and Mail animations\n\n*Get rid of Dashboard\n\n*Remove login items and tray applications\n\n*Make sure you have 5-10% free space\n\n\nA: A lot of great answers here and all totally correct. Wipe the system is an absolute and drastic way that positively removes all junk files off your system but will consume your evening to complete the task. Upgrade your RAM to increase load speed - make sure you have all the same speed of RAM, else all your RAM will run at the speed of the slowest chip. a SSD is a great and amazing upgrade, but may be too expensive for you. If you do install a SDD make sure you check the cable too as I doubt the cable on your current HDD can power the full speed of the SDD giving you a noticeable improvement, but not the total.\nQuestion. how many fonts are on your computer? As a designer/developer I once realized it took my 2008/2009ish work iMac a few minutes to boot, then 23-30 minutes to login because of my font library being massive. If you're in the same boat look into font management software, or a quick fix, delete all but your system fonts temporarily (move them to a folder outside of fontbook) and see if that improves... It helped my mac a lot. \n", "Q: Bluetooth Remote for Mac (for Plex) So now that Macs no longer come with infrared I can't use the Apple Remote to control Plex, which is pretty disappointing.\nDoes anyone know of a good Bluetooth remotes that will work with Plex? I've seen the Satechi Bluetooth Multimedia Remote, but it looks like its not compatible.\nAlternatively, I've seen this Twisted Melon IR Receiver, however its pretty big and bulk so its far from an ideal solution.\nIve been using a combination of the iOS app and the Apple wireless keyboard, but none are idea. The iOS app doesn't remember the volume of the client, and freezes, and besides, I much prefer a physical keyboard.\nHas anyone seen a small Bluetooth remote thats compatible with Plex (or, sends keyboard commands), or a small IR receiver compatible with Mac?\n\nA: The Satechi Bluetooth Smart Pointer is actually a pretty good choice. I have a number of teachers at this school who use it for their classes all the time. It works a lot like the Apple Remote that has been (essentially) discontinued for Macs. It has some additional features, like a laser pointer. To make it work with Plex, you can just use it in Accessibility Mode (this makes it behave more like a keyboard than a remote).\nOn a slightly unrelated note, it can also be used to control iOS devices, which I thought would be useless; but, it turns out to have some very convenient implementations around campus that I hadn't imagined. \nCertainly worth $50, from my perspective.\n\nA: Plex is a bit limited, when it comes to remote support, in fact, their forums are filled with posts about remote-related problems. \nI am pretty sure that no Bluetooth remote will work with Plex out of the box. \nRemote Buddy is a great tool to get various remotes to work on a Mac (and Plex). It supports quite a decent amount of remotes, which are all listed on the site. \nI would work down from there and also make my choices according to their supported hardware list. \n\nA: Try Satechi Bluetooth Smart Pointer.\n\nA: try your own iphone with the plex app...\n", "Q: Mail App is using internet connection to capacity (Retina Macbook Pro Early 2013) My internet connection is working to capacity while \"Mail\" is open.

In which case the 1000 picture limit wont be an issue?\n\n*Am I right in understanding that the pictures will lose some resolution when viewed on the ipad but will keep the resolution when viewed on my Windows PC?\n\n*Does all of the above only work when connected to WiFi?\nThanks \n\nA: Yes, photos imported into an iPad do get shared through Photo Stream. This feature is mentioned in this Apple KB article.\n\nThe 1000 picture limit is a per hour limit. Apple says (in the same KB article) that…\n\nIf you exceed one of these limits, your uploads to Photo Stream will be paused temporarily and you may see a notification message on your device. Your uploads will resume automatically once you no longer exceed one of the limits (such as the following hour or day).\n\nIn addition to the 1000 picture limit, there are further limits…\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Uploads to My Photo Stream per day: 10,000 photos\n  \n*Uploads to My Photo Stream per month: 25,000 photos\n  \n\nThese limits can not be circumvented (as far as I know) by having your computer constantly sync to Photo Stream.\n\nThis Apple KB article explains Photo Stream resolutions:\n\nOn your Mac or PC, your photos are downloaded and stored in full resolution. On your iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, and Apple TV, your Photo Stream photos are delivered in a device-optimized resolution that speeds downloads and saves storage space. While actual dimensions will vary, an optimized version of a photo taken by a standard point-and-shoot camera will have a 2048 x 1536 pixel resolution when pushed to your devices. Panoramic photos can be up to 5400 pixels wide.\n\n\nAccording to the same Apple KB article as the previous, yes, Wi-Fi is required for Photo Stream to work (emphasis not mine).\n\nOn an iOS device, new photos you take will be automatically uploaded to your photo stream when you leave the Camera app and are connected to Wi-Fi. Note: My Photo Stream does not push photos over cellular connections.\n\n\nA: Then again, if you are at all concerned about Apple's cloud services, as any sane person might be, why not sign up for DropBox - a thoroughly reputable, dependable service that is free up to a certain limit. And you can increase your DropBox size by registering friends etc. The iPhone and iPad apps have automatic Camera Upload service (when you have a connection) and installing the Mac desktop application means that those photos--and anything else synced to DropBox is available to any and all of your Macs. I use it for LAN syncing, moving things around my home network, as well. \nJust makes sense to me to have real backups of photos somewhere, and on your machine as well. Also, photos are readily shared from DropBox - though you can make as many photostreams as you like, sending them pretty much instantly to anyone with a Mac who accepts the invitation.\n", "Q: What are only necessary processes (minimal set) for OS X work? What are only necessary processes (minimal set) for OS X work?\nWhat are the differences in the sets for different versions (Lion minimal set, Mountain Lion minimal set)?\nWhat are the processes that are not needed for the OS X operates?\nI know the descriptions of the processes (here: http://triviaware.com/macprocess/all), but I don't know what is the minimal set of pprocesses to start the OS X (Mountain Lion) with GUI, (e.g. without dashboard, without notification center).\nUpdate:\nI would like to have a minimal set of processes/services for the system can boot and launch the minimal graphical desktop environment (like KDE/Unity/GNOME in Linux world) + possibility to launch the terminal (simple bash) + possibility to launch/quit processes + process monitoring + (optionally) finder.

I originally formatted this drive on a Mac. I have two Trendnet TV-IP572PI surveillance cameras that records snapshots/video to this drive over SMB. Sometimes when I mount the drive from my Mac ('Connect to server' @ smb://192.168.1.1) and attempt to delete old directories off of it, I get this error:\n\nThe operation can’t be completed because you don’t have permission to access some of the items.\n\nThis is extremely frustrating since I have to unplug the USB drive, plug it back into my Mac, and format it to get it working again. I assume this is some kind of permissions problem, and when these permissions are messed up, the cameras aren't writing to the drive. I may not notice this for days if I have been out of town.\nSearching Google for this error mostly turns up results about disabling a unix extensions setting in smb.conf on the server you are connecting to. I have no way to do this since the Samba server runs off of the Asus router. Email support from ASUS has not been helpful so far, with recommendations to upgrade the firmware and do a hard reset on the router (have latest firmware already). I believe this problem stems from mounting the drive from my Mac.\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: There are actually two messages you're referring to: \n\n\"This operation can't be completed because the item is in use\"\n\nand \n\n\"The operation can’t be completed because you don’t have permission to\n  access some of the items.\"\n\nIf you see the first one - I sometimes get that message too. Quite often this can be resolved by running: sudo lsof | grep <filename> in Terminal.app - obviously replace <filename> with the actual name of the file you're trying to delete. I typically get this when trying to empty the trash, but if the trash is not supported on the filesystem you have mounted, you may see it when trying to delete. \nWhat lsof does is it lists all open files, and shows which process opened each of them. Quite often this will be a quick look process that opened the file and somehow didn't close it (it will do that when you display a list of movie files in Finder - it will then try to show you the first frame of the movie in the preview, and it's using Quick Look to do that). \nUsually after running the lsof the files are closed (that's if lsof doesn't show anything), or I can just kill the quick look process and then empty the trash. \nAs for the other message - the best thing to do is to run ls -la <filename> or ls -lad <directory> to see the permissions on the file or the folder you're trying to remove. This may give you a better idea where the problem is. \n\nA: I found that connecting through FTP using Filezilla worked better instead. It doesn't give MacOS the opportunity to make any changes to the file structure there.\n\nA: What file system do you create on your shared drive? Looks like you are using wrong FS.\nI use Ext3 at the same router and connect successfully from my pc and from my mac. I always have necessary permissions to do anything.\nBTW you should remember, you cannot use Ext3 disk directly with your mac. Only thru the router.\nTo format disk to Ext3 FS you can do it with Linux PC (if you have one) or with router itself:\n\n\n*\n\n*Enable telnet access to your router:\na. connect to your router's control panel via web-broser (e.g. access http://192.168.1.1 or what is IP of your router is)\nb.

I know that official iOS support for bluetooth keyboards is minimal, and that AutoCorrect is theoretically unavailable. (According to Meg St. Claire via the Apple support forums, this is by design). Yet iOS seems able to AutoCorrect some words but not others: it auto-capitalizes phrases like \"The Lord,\" \"Supreme Court,\" and \"United States,\" complete with a drop-down suggestion box that can be dismissed with the [ESC] button. If you type \"teh\" on the other hand, it just red-underlines it, which can't be accessed via the keyboard; you have to tap it with your finger. \nThings I've checked:\n\n\n*\n\n*\"Shortcuts\" section in the settings -- none of the phrases I mentioned are there. \n\n*Not using TextExpander or any similar software. \n\n*The autocorrection appears system-wide -- not limited to any single app.             \n\n\nIs there any way to explain the idiosyncracy? I'm using an iPad running the latest version of iOS and an Apple Bluetooth keyboard. \n\nA: The autocorrect built into iOS since the first iPhone release has been a \"smart\" autocorrect. It is designed so that we can type quickly, trusting that the keyboard will usually get it right. I've found this to be the case, with the need to only occasionally go back after typing a paragraph to make a correction or two.\nIn contrast to what you said, I've found that typing \"teh\" does automatically change to \"the\" if I continue typing, trusting the keyboard to fix it. There are exceptions. Something to be aware of is that if you use the Backspace key, the keyboard will assume you're manually fixing something; as an example, if you type \"teh\", don't type any other keys after that, then backspace the \"h\" and type the \"h\" again, when you continue by pressing the spacebar, it won't autocorrect the word to \"the\".\nThe keyboard gets smarter if you train it by canceling its incorrect suggestions.\nIt isn't perfect. Sometimes I've noticed that it tries to change \"the Lord\" to \"The Lord\" in the middle of a sentence, which is not proper grammar. It also sometimes tries to incorrectly change \"its\" to \"it's\", and no matter how many times I correct it, the keyboard doesn't seem to learn from these two mistakes.\n", "Q: 5Gb of RAM being used with NO software running?

It seemed simple enough to just run Boot Camp 5 with a 16GB flash drive in the USB port and a Windows 8 Professional ISO sitting on the desktop with the intent of creating a bootable USB drive, but it's not working for me.  After selecting the path to the ISO file, boot camp proceeds to format the flash drive, create the WININSTALL partition, and attempt to copy the contents of the ISO to it, but it fails.\nThe error message isn't all that helpful, but the console logs seem to indicate that there is some sort of problem remounting the flash drive after formatting:\n5/15/13 2:05:05.609 AM fseventsd[40]: could not open <</Volumes/WININSTALL/.fseventsd/fseventsd-uuid>> (No such file or directory)\n5/15/13 2:05:05.609 AM fseventsd[40]: log dir: /Volumes/WININSTALL/.fseventsd getting new uuid: FD5D8B3E-A08E-4710-8925-CAA898FA70C3\n5/15/13 2:05:05.679 AM fseventsd[40]: Events arrived for /Volumes/WININSTALL after an unmount request!

I use the Notes app with iCloud. The 'Notes' folder under 'iCloud' is set as my default account under Notes > Default Account > iCloud. This ensures that new notes are created in iCloud instead of on my Mac. However, I also have notes folders in the 'On My Mac' section. I actually only use this so that I have a local backup of my iCloud notes.\n\nThe problem is that the default view when I open the app is 'All Notes'. This means that my notes are duplicated: I see both the notes in iCloud and the local backup copies. The app doesn't 'remember' the view selected when the app was last closed.\nIs there any way of forcing Notes.app to show only iCloud notes by default? \n\nA: I guess the answer's 'no', then.

I would like to see when to start recording and when to stop.\nI have found several apps in the App Store that allow remote video between two iPhones or iPhone/iPad, but found none for iPhone to Mac OS X.  (I don't have two iPhones, nor an iPad).\nUnfortunately, I have upgraded to 6.1.3 on 4S, so I can't jailbreak it for installing a VNC server, which would be the easiest and best solution.\nI'm hoping I missed some apps — can anybody suggest a solution?\n\nA: There seem to be a handful of apps available that allow your iPhone to act as a webcam for your Mac over Wi-Fi, which would allow you to view and record video from them. A few of the ones I found:\n\n\n*\n\n*PocketCam\n\n*Mobiola WebCamera\n\n*iWebcamera\nFor recording purposes, you may need to use the built-in recording functionality of QuickTime Player, although some of the apps seem to have free companion OS X software that will accomplish the same goal.\n\nA: One way around it is to connect your iPhone via lighting cable. Then you will be able to preview iPhone's screen on your mac via QuickTime -> File -> New Movie Recording (select iPhone as source).\nThat way you can see what is being recorded on your iPhone - perfect if you are recording yourself and want to somehow check if you are within the frame. It has some issues (can not start/stop recording via mac + portrait vs landscape issue) however maybe it will be good enough. It was better than anything else I found as 3rd party apps are (were?) laggy.\n", "Q: Is there a setting to make the Mac not change resolution when connecting to an external display? I am currently running 2880x1800 resolution on my MacBook Pro retina (using the command setgetscreenres).\nWhenever I connect to an external display, my Mac changes to a lower resolution. Is there a way to disable this behavior?\nAlso I've noticed that sometimes instead of extending the display, it mirrors my display on some external displays. I don't think I will ever use mirror mode, so is there another setting to make all external displays extend?\n\nA: In mirroring mode, both screens need to use the same resolution.  The external display probably can't support the huge 2880x1800, so it's lowering yours to match.\nIn System Preferences > Displays > Arrangement tab, uncheck the mirroring option.  Then you should see two separate preferences windows, allowing you to set different resolutions for each display.  Note — the Arrangement tab is only visible when you have an external display connected.\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/HT5266\n\nA: I have this exact problem, and deselecting \"mirroring\" does not work prevent the primary display from changing to this garish cartoon resolution (aka Best For Display).\nIt is false that a MacBook Pro that has a screen capable of 2880x1800 cannot handle a second screen. It does it rather well. It can even handle 2 extra full 1080p screens (actually one of my extra screens was better than 1080p) on top of the built in retina screen, all simultaneously, without any sort of slow down while doing normal work (not games).\nWhat makes this process somewhat annoying is that when you are used to working in 2880x1800, you may have your windows arranged a certain way. When the resolution goes down, the window arrangement is ruined (they're all shoved into the upper lefthand corner) and going back to the original higher resolution does not restore placement of all your windows. If it were a matter of merely going into the settings and restoring my original resolution, that would only be a minor nuisance.\nI should note that OSX will generally remember not to change your primary display's resolution after you have gone through this process once, once for each physical monitor. I believe the port used must be the same as well.\n", "Q: Notification centre in Lion and Facebook When notifications pop up from the notification centre for Facebook posts nothing happens when I click the show button.\nIf a tweet comes along the show button opens up a browser tab.\nAny ideas why this isn't working for Facebook and is working for Twitter?\n\nA: OK, go to your Facebook \nopen your settings and go to the the Notifications\nMake sure the app request and activity for OSX is checked\nIn Notification on your Mac click on the facebook and a window should open where you can post directly to facebook from your mac.\n", "Q: How to remove an environment variable on OSX using bash I'm running under Snow Leopard 10.6.8 and I recently added an environment variable which it seems to be messing my bash terminal (I guess). \nWhat I did is add the variable DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/Library/PostgreSQL/9.2/lib to my .bash_profile file, which looks like this:\nexport PATH=/Users/Carlos/pear/bin:$PATH:/Users/Carlos/android-sdks/platforms:/Users/Carlos/android-sdks/platforms-tools:/Library/PostgreSQL/9.2/bin/\n# Setting PATH for Python 2.7\n# The orginal version is saved in .bash_profile.pysave\nPATH=\"/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin:${PATH}\"\nexport PATH\nexport DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/Library/PostgreSQL/9.2/lib\n\nAnd then run the command:\nsource ~/.bash_profile\n\nSo that now I can see the variable listed along with all the environment variables when I run \"set\" on the terminal.\nThe thing is I want to remove it.

I have Adobe After Effects but it is not at all intuitive to use -- or better I need to find some button to render the sounds with the movie but now no time -- is there some easy fast-to-use software for OS X to combine sounds and videos?\n\nA: iMovie is the obvious choice. It's very easy to use and fairly reasonable in price. You might have it already if you have a newish mac or else it's $15 I think.\nhttp://www.apple.com/ilife/imovie/\n\nA: ffmpeg supports combining video and audio without re-encoding:\nffmpeg -i input.mov -i input.mp3 -c copy -map 0:0 -map 1:0 -shortest output.mov\n\n-map 0:0 means input file 0, stream 0. -c copy copies video and audio codecs. -shortest makes the combined file as long as the shorter file.\n\nA: Adobe After Effects\nI remembered now how to do it in After Effects: Composition > Add to Render Queue and then click lossless and put the cross to the audio thing.

I'm viewing courses on coursera (a free classroom site) and the material is just going too quickly.

You could import the video, edit the speed, and export.\nIf you're looking for a solution that's a bit less time consuming, you could try SpeedUpTV. Although the app isn't free, it lets you adjust playback speed on-the-fly in the app:\n\n", "Q: Restoring finder icon I have moved certain sections (downloads, music, pictures) of my user directory from my SSD to my HDD via symlinks. I have successfully changed over the image of the folder which can be seen in the finder. \nAfter removing the original folder the item is also removed from the sidebar, after creating the symlink I have added the folder back to the sidebar but have noticed that the default icons for such folders is no longer present and simply presented using a blank blue folder.\nHow can I get the original icons displayed in the sidebar?\n\nA: Goto your Home Folder > Library > Preferences and delete the files:\ncom.apple.finder.plist    \ncom.apple.sidebarlists.plist\n\nIf you can't find the files use this method: from the Finder menu bar, select Go > Go to Folder and copy the following line into the text box that opens:\n~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.finder.plist\n\nThen, restart, or log out and in again.\nEdit\nSelect Go > Go to Folder and copy the following line into the text box that opens:\n/System/Library/CoreServices/CoreTypes.bundle/Contents/Resources/\n\nHere is where you will find all the sidebar icons -\n\nNow you will have to manually change the icons for the respective folders by using Get Info on the folder that is in your sidebar and by dragging and dropping the icns file onto on the Inspector panel.\n\nA: This is a lot easier than my comment, so I thought it was worthy of answer status: \n\n\n*\n\n*go to /System/Library/CoreServices/CoreTypes.bundle/Contents/Resources\n\n*there you will find: \nApplicationsFolderIcon.icns* DesktopFolderIcon.icns DocumentsFolderIcon.icns\nDownloadsFolderIcon.icns LibraryFolderIcon.icns MoviesFolderIcon.icns MusicFolderIcon.icns PicturesIcon.icns PublicFolderIcon.icns SitesFolderIcon.icns*\n\n*open each one of these in Preview.app.\n\n*click the disclosure triangle so that you are only viewing ONE version (not all the sizes) in the sidebar of Preview.

If it's not pixelated, you'll be fine.\n\nA: The method in this video works for me (10.9).\nBelow are the steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Drag your folder to the sidebar to create a link.\n\n*On the normal folder that have the icon on it, press Cmd-I, click on the icon, and press Cmd-C.\n\n*Right click on the new link in the sidebar\n\n*Click \"Get info\"\n\n*Click on the folder icon at the top, and press Cmd-v\n\n*Now the folder has an icon\n\n*Drag the folder with Cmd and Option pressed to create an link the the fold\n\n*The link will have the same icon as the folder\n\n\nA: I am pretty sure none of these approaches actually works, at least in El Capitan. The best approach I have found is to keep the special folders in your home directory and sidebar, and symlink out the subfolders. So, e.g., I have a real Music folder in ~/, but inside that is a symlink to /Volumes/[external]/Music/iTunes/. That gets the 100Gb of iTunes content off my main volume but keeps the sidebar icon.\nLess elegant but I don't think anything else works.\nNote that if you already screwed up and deleted the special folder in your user directory, you can indeed su cp an empty special folder (e.g. ~/Music) from a new user you create, and it will work - even the permissions will probably automatically update, but check.\n", "Q: Is it possible to use the Xserve VPN service without using the DHCP service?

Is there a way to connect the latest Apple TV, which only has an HDMI output, to an older television that only has the yellow and red/white inputs for audio and video? This older television has a coaxial input as well. \n\nA: You're having a hard time determining it cause those \"yellow / white\" cables are called \"RCA\" ports, created by one of the first TV makers and ironically mostly sold off to Japanese companies.\nSearching for \"RCA to HDMI converter\" yields a wealth of converters and opinions about the best devices based on the model of TV\nsuch as this article:\nhttp://techchannel.radioshack.com/convert-hdmi-rca-1778.html\n\nA: Technically the format you want is called composite video, so you might have better luck searching for a HDMI to Composite converter.\nRCA is just the name of the connector.

I can see in Paragon Partition Manager that the drive is a GPT Hard Disk, how do i go about viewing the files on Windows? The PC I have connected it to has dualboot ubuntu, would it be easier to access the files from linux? Any freeware suggestions? I have tried googling for a few tutorials but these tend to focus on a dead HDD.\nThanks.\n\nA: GTP isn't the issue, it's the HFS+ (aka Mac OS Extended) volume inside it; in order to read that, you need HFS+ drivers for Windows (or Linux or whatever). Paragon sells a driver for this, or you could use the drivers from Apple's Boot Camp software. I can't vouch for their authenticity, but I found downloads claiming to be just the HFS+ parts of Boot Camp at MacRumors.com and MacBreaker.com.\n", "Q: Using Find my iPhone to track my daughters phone Can I use find my iPhone to track my daughters phone if we each have different apple ids?\n\nA: Only the main Apple ID on the device (the one that has iCloud backups available) is available to log in to Find my iPhone. Any secondary iCloud accounts added to the device can not be used to track the device.\nIf she doesn't mind that her Apple ID won't be the main one, then yes, you can set it up with your Apple ID as the main one and that will work fine.\nAlso, if she doesn't mind, you can log in with her Apple ID.\nIf not, you can use Find my Friends since this works across multiple Apple IDs.\n\nA: The consolidated answer is: YES, you can use Find My iPhone to track someone else's iPhone, so long as you know the main Apple ID and password that is being used on that phone.  To track the phone, install the Find My iPhone app from the App Store on your phone, then log into the app using the Apple ID and password being used on the other phone (i.e., your daughter's Apple ID).\nIf you don't mind your daughter knowing that you are tracking her location, then the Find My Friends app (also from Apple) is a better solution for tracking since it allows you to track multiple phones simultaneously without having to log into the their Apple IDs, and allows geofenced alerts (e.g. \"alert me when my daughter leaves school\").  One potential downside is that using Find My Friends will also share your location with your daughter (and anyone else you are tracking).\n\nA: To directly answer your question, you may use Find My iPhone to track your daughter's iPhone using the Find My iPhone app that you can download from the app store - without any consequence to your own Apple ID that is in use on your device. All you need to do is sign into her Apple ID in the app, and it should show her device (as long as Find my iPhone is enabled on her device).\nWhen using the Find my iPhone app, you can keep your Apple IDs completely autonomous, and all you need to know is her Apple ID.\nLike @grgarside mentioned. Find My Friends would probably be a better option either way since you can set up geofence notifications, and such.\n\nA: \"Track\" may not be the most accurate term.  You can \"locate\" (or find) your daughter's iPhone, but only if she has the app and iCloud enabled.  If she turns it off on her phone, then you will not be able to locate her phone (or her).  The app does not \"track\" in terms of showing you where she as been, from location to location. In other words, she could have it on when she's home, turn it off and go to the mall with her friends, then turn it back on when she gets home and you will not know - other than the app will indicate an \"old location\" when it attempts to find her phone and the app/ iCloud are turned off.\n\nA: Answer for ios 13+:\n\n*\n\n*On your daughter's phone, open the Find My app.\n\n*Select Share My Location\n\n*Select yourself to share her location.\n\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210514\n", "Q: Time Machine backup to Airport Extreme AirDisk I thought it was NOT possible to use the USB hard disk attached to the Airport Extreme Base Station (AEBS) as a backup destination for Time Machine backups.

Is there a way to check for weak battery? My battery dies after 2 hours of use but still outputs 3.7V in a multimeter check. Could it still be dead?\n\nA: The answer is yes it could be week.\nWhat you measuring is the Voltage without LOAD.\nIn that state even an almost completely empty battery will output the Voltage it was designed for.\nYou need to bridge it with a resistor (load) and then measure voltage.\nYour multimeter does that (LOAD) but only very small kind, like micro amps by bridging the outputs with a resistor of 1 Meg or more so it draws very small current\nTry using a LED or if you have resistors of lets say 100 Ohm, use that as load (bridge).\n", "Q: How can I shut down an unlisted php-fpm?

I received an iMessage from a @yahoo.com address saying \"hi\". I then asked who this was and the reason for the message and also how he obtained my number and email. He claimed that he has me stored in his directory as \"Abba\". I'm certainly no Abba! \nI asked him to remove me from his contacts, to which he agreed. Today the idiot messages me again saying hi. I mentioned that I would have him reported, he then called on FaceTime and hung up???? Also sent me a pic of himself!! How do I block him from contacting me, this is rather annoying?\n\nA: First, the best advice for dealing with a hungry troll: don't feed him.  \nIgnore this guy, and he will quickly get bored and move on.\nIf your device runs iOS 7, you can block FaceTime and messages from known addresses that disturb you.\nHowever, if unknown individuals are bothering you with frequent iMessage text messages, you can adjust your Notification settings to ensure that you are not interrupted with alerts when messages from unknown contacts are received (the messages will still be waiting for you in the Messages app, but you will not receive pop-up or banner notifications about them).\nTo disable notifications for iMessages from unknown contacts, go to the Settings app, then Notifications, then Messages, then scroll down to the \"Show iMessage Alerts From\" and select My Contacts Only.\nThen, ensure that the person who is harassing you via iMessages is NOT in your Contacts.  You should no longer receive alerts about his messages (but they will still be received in the Messages app).\nNote that this also means that you will not receive notifications about messages received from ANY unknown contacts - you will only receive notifications about messages received from phone numbers or email addresses that are stored in your Contacts.  So, be sure to check your Messages app regularly to see if you've received any messages from people not in your Contacts list that you WANT to hear from.\n\nA: Just as anyone can dial a phone number, whether you have it unlisted or they don't know who you are - anyone can face time or message whatever address or phone number they care to.\nWith telephones you can block things from the phone company as their software is programed to allow this. With iOS 7, it also can be programmed to block calls from a caller that you don't want to hear from again.\nFrom the settings app, use Message or FaceTime preferences to add numbers to a your devices block list. \n\n\nA: Here is my story.  I have been facetiming my elderly mother nightly for a long time.   I call my mother on her iPad through her email.  When we upgraded to iOS 7 we started to have trouble, she said she was not receiving my calls.  Finally last night some random (and angry) woman answered my FaceTime call and told me not to call her anymore. It looks like FaceTime on occasion is  connecting people to the wrong number or email address.  Seeing I'm on the calling side,rather than the recieving side, of this issue, it is not malishish, it is a technical problem that Apple needs to fix.  \n\nA: This has been happening to me a lot.  I get a FaceTime call from someone. I decline it because I don't accept FaceTime calls from people I don't know. But this one was insistent so I called it back, prefixing the number with #31# (I am in Australia on Telstra so that's the prefix they supply to block caller-id - see http://exchange.telstra.com.au/2012/06/19/how-to-block-your-number-when-calling-someone/) and spoke to the guy.  It turns out he's not a troll or spammer, but just a guy who thought he was FaceTimeing his wife and kids. I got him to try again, checking the number first and confirming it was nothing at all like my own number, and sure enough, his call came through to me, and his wife.  When his wife answered it showed up on my phone as \"answered on another device\".  So somehow his wife's number has become associated with my Apple Id.\nIt's possible that his wife used to have my number, as per this https://discussions.apple.com/thread/6259693?tstart=0 (my number is only about 4 years old) but we checked that and he claimed that was not the case. However he's not called me back since so perhaps he checked and then went and cleaned out his old contacts.\nJust today I got another such FaceTime call from another weird number. I guess it's the same problem.\n\nA: Call your phone company or go on their site and have that number/email blocked. I know verizon has a blocking option right on their website.

For example, iTunes is signed by Apple, and so it is automatically allowed to receive incoming connections through the firewall.\nWhen you installing software you are been asked if you trust them to proceed, and if you say yes they certificate is stored in your keychain. In keychain you cam modify the Trust level.\n", "Q: Tranferring Apps from 1 ipad to another I received an Ipad from my employer for work.  I also have a personal Ipad.  I set up 2 different apple ids, one for work and one for personal use.  I now want to return my work Ipad but tranfer the apps etc to my personal Ipad.  How do I do this?\n\nA: There is, unfortunately, no way to transfer apps between Apple IDs. The closest thing you can do is switch between the Apple IDs on your personal iPad. You will have to use your work Apple ID to download the apps. First you will have to login using your work Apple ID (Settings.app -> iTunes & App Stores -> Account) on your iPad then redownload whatever you want on your personal iPad.\nPlease understand one important thing that once there is an app update, or if they change your work Apple ID's email or password, you will have a problem in the future.\nI suggest that you redownload all the apps using your own Apple ID.\n", "Q: Is there an easy way to get notified of updates for all of my non-Mac App Store apps?

I'm talking about things like Skype, Spotify, Firefox etc. without having to go and start up each app first and let it do its own update check. \nI've seen sites like OldVersion and OldApps which do have information about the latest versions of apps and their release dates, which could potentially be \"scraped\" to obtain this information, but they don't seem to be updated terribly regularly as far as I can tell.\n\nA: \nAppFresh helps you to keep all applications, widgets, preference panes\n  and application plugins installed on your Mac up to date.\n\nhttp://metaquark.de/appfresh/mac\nAppFresh for Mac license for $14.99\n\nA: Macupdate Desktop does this for $20/year.\nThe MacUpdate.com website is the most actively updated website for Mac software that I know of. They often notify me of updates to software before I'm even aware that they are available, even if it is popular software that I use frequently.\nThe app can be set to automatically run even X hours or days. In addition, you can choose to be notified by email when certain apps are updated.\nFor each app that it finds out of date, you can choose to either download it and manually install it, or download and install it automatically from within the app. You can also tell it to \"Download and Install All.\"\nThe app is not perfect (obviously… what app is?), and sometimes it isn't aware of a particular app, but overall it is the best solution that I am aware of for keeping non-MAS apps updated.\n(Aside: I tinkered with trying to write my own script to check for apps and update them, but it's pretty tedious and you pretty much need to write a separate process to check each app, so spending $20/year to have someone else do it seems like a pretty good deal to me.)\n\nA: My system is to not install apps that don't have a mechanism for alerting me of their update status.\nI have an email account (or you could use rules) and RSS technology to keep track of seldom used apps. Most apps I use regularly also have internal update notifications similar to Apple's for iTunes and MAS/OS updates.\nThat bypasses the need to devote time and resources to track something the developer should have solved. Just as we don't accept cars that don't have check engine and low fuel warnings, software should be expected to be miserly of our time for routine maintenance and error conditions such as not checking for an update regularly.\n", "Q: Macbook Air not waking up from Suspend/Sleep with rEFInd boot manager installed Having installed both rEFInd 0.6.10 (updated to 0.6.11) via its install.sh and Ubuntu 13.04 on another partition I can now choose on a MacBook Air to boot either MacOS or Linux.\nWhen running MacOS and closing and soon re-opening the lid, everything is fine, but after a longer time of closed lid, the machine is not waking/starting up.

I am looking for the most straightforward way (both in initial setup and in maintenance) to set up a second partition on an OS X machine for (either) Debian or Ubuntu. I won't be running any other OSes so the ability to triple boot is of no interest to me.\nMost articles suggest installing a third-party bootloader, either Refit or Refind, as one of the first steps. Is this really necessary? In the past, I've just partitioned some empty space with Disk Utility and let the Ubuntu installer format and install to it however it pleases. Is there something wrong with this approach?\n\nA: Formatting a partition with Disk Utility on OS X and letting the Ubuntu installer do the rest of the work is a simple and straightforward approach.\nThe Ubuntu installer also takes care of configuring and installing the bootloader.\nTheoretically, you could boot Linux with only Grub-EFI, as the Linux kernel supports direct EFI boot. But this requires a lot on work on Macs, because you need to configure and install grub-efi.

It's old but has only been lightly used, until recently.\n\nA: I've had a similar problem with a 2 TB Fantom drive.

And right from the start I kept having this weird issue: sometimes while I'm working on it, the screen (and the monitor attached via displayport aswell) randomly shuts off (or goes to sleep). The computer is still active and everything is still running normally, so If I hit a key it goes back on normally... It happens even if my power cord is plugged in. \nIt's not a big deal, but it sometimes gets very annoying when it happens while I am typing.\nAny clues?\nThanks!\n\nA: Assuming it only happens sometimes and only when you are actively using the computer (key board & Mouse)\nLets find out if it is you doing it.\nCheck your settings for Display Sleep in:\nSystem preferences> Desktop and Screen saver> Hot Corners!\nIn here look if you have a setting to put display to sleep.\n\nA: Mine did the same. Apple fixed it four times and even replaced the computer without resolution of the problem. I finally discovered that it was the magnetic clasp on my Apple Watch band triggering the magnetic sensor in the upper left portion by the keyboard. This is normally triggered by a magnet in the lower left portion of the display that the tells the computer when it is shut.\n\nA: Make sure that your Display's sleep settings are set to \"Never\" on both battery power and AC power. Also, another setting might be affecting the sleep function. Go to System Preferences, then Security and Privacy, then click the Privacy tab, and then Click the Lock to Make Changes. That will allow you to click on \"Advanced\" in the lower right corner. This will open a pop-up; be sure to UNCHECK \"Log out after ___ minutes.\"  That's what was constantly putting my MacBook Air to sleep and logging me out of all open applications. Lots of GRRRR moments trying to figure it out, but once located, it took care of the problem.\n\nA: Seconding Jerry Mazza's answer above.  The same thing was just happening to my Air.  The screen just blacked out and would not return until I jiggled everything around for five minutes.\nTurns out my ipad pro with magnetic cover was sitting right next to the upper-left section of the keyboard (until my jiggling separated them).  I can do it reproducibly now just by sliding the ipad into position... poof: screen goes black.\n\nA: Make sure the upper left corner of your MacBook air doesn't touch any magnet. Turns out my kindle's magnetic cover is coming into contact with the laptop leading to the screen turing off.\n", "Q: iCloud won't let me download some deleted iTunes TV episodes again I have purchased a bunch of TV shows iTunes.\nThe original files for these shows are no longer on my hard drive and I probably deleted them. They show up in the iTunes directory, but when I try to play, I get a dialog box that says \"The TV show could not be used because the original file could not be found. Would you like to locate it?\"  If I say yes, I get a file dialog. This is not useful, because the files are no longer on my computer.\nNow, Apple tells me that if I've purchased a show and delete it from my disk (say, to save space), I can download it from iCloud:\nhttp://www.apple.com/itunes/inside-itunes/2012/03/movies-now-available-on-icloud.html\nSo, I follow the instructions, go to the iTunes Store, go to purchased TV shows and select the program I purchased, but each episode only says \"Downloaded\", and there's no way to re-download the missing episodes.\nThis is not true for all shows. For some shows that are not on my hard drive, I see a little iCloud icon and am able to click & download the missing episodes.\nIt's possible that the un-downloadable shows were downloaded and deleted before iCloud supported downloading purchased episodes, but I don't know for certain if that's the problem. It just a hypothesis I don't know how to test.\nAny thoughts on how to restore access to these deleted shows within iCloud?\n\nA: Delete them from iTunes, so they don't show up in your TV section. But don't delete them from iCloud. Then they should appear with a download button on the poster for it if iTunes in the cloud is enabled (you will see a cloud in iTunes). You can either click that download button, or go to purchases in the iTunes store and download it from there.   \nI think what you must've done is deleted the actual file, but not deleted it from iTunes. Normally when deleting something in iTunes, it deletes from iTunes, and then asks you if you want to delete the actual file as well or not. \n", "Q: MBP with Mountain Lion 10.8.3 loses connection to system SSD at random times and freezes So, out of nowhere my 2009 MacBook (2,66 GHz Core 2 Duo, 8 GByte aftermarket ram) started freezing after 200+ days of uptime (sleep time included of course). I had installed a Crucial CT256M4SSD2 256Gbyte SSD a year and a half ago and were quite happy with system stability.\nNow these logs appear quite often before freezing my machine completely:\ndisk0s2: no such device\ndisk0s2: media is not present\n\nHere is a photograph of such a log (original, larger sized photo here):\n\nThe reason I had to do a photo is, of course, because disk0s2 is my harddrive and at the moment of logging it was apparently gone - so no persistent logs for me.\nI tried a diagnose and repair with the Disk Utility, but it found nothing and the problem persisted. Uninstalled a couple of apps, but also to no avail. Any advice on how to proceed with diagnosing the problem would be much appreciated.\n\nA: A firmware update for that SSD was released early this year: have you updated?  The release notes mention:\n\nResolved a power-up timing issue that could result in a drive hang, resulting in an inability to communicate with the host computer. The hang condition would typically occur during power-up or resume from Sleep or Hibernate. Most often, a new power cycle will clear the condition and allow normal operations to continue.\n\n(Personally I'm using a CT128M4SSD2 and have decided not to update unless I encounter issues.)\n\nA: This is probably similar to a horrific bug in the original firmware of my Crucial SSD (I think a different model, but I don't work on that machine anymore). After a certain number of hours—so the long uptime is relevant, but in a lifetime way—the drive would shut down every hour, after exactly 60 minutes. I assume this was some testing code that inexplicably got burned into real customer hardware.\nA firmware upgrade fixed this. I thought I did it from a Linux machine command line (which would usually work on a Mac), but maybe not.\n", "Q: Drag email from mail.app to create a shortcut, not eml The title is self-explainatory.\nOnce I succeeded, and there was .inetloc file including XML\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n    <key>URL</key>\n    <string>message:%3CCAODRpat8f6Ca07rDHa+-uq23Cp1nk5E9MEReXbX8YaXfMcu8BA@mail.gmail.com%3E</string>\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\nBut now I can't recall how I did that.

Is it currently possible through an app (regardless of whether the iPhone is jailbroken) to cycle through different ring tones for each new message and call that comes in? \nFor example, if a user has 50 ringtones on their phone, the ringtones would cycle with every incoming message or call.\n\nA: Unfortunately, unless the device is jailbroken, this wouldn't be possible. The APIs available to Apple iOS developers don't allow the change of system level events. Even creating ringtones on the device to use is somewhat convoluted.

It doesn't make any difference what I am doing on it whether it be CPU intensive or the machine is just idling, without fail after an hour goes by it starts to beach ball and becomes totally unresponsive. I let it sit for an hour the other day but it just kept beach balling, so all I can do is hold the power button to shut it down and then restart it, but after an hour the same thing happens again.

If anyone has any ideas what could be causing this please let me know. \n\nA: I found the CULPRIT, my SSD needed a firmware update. \nCrucial Offers Firmware Update For Crucial m4 SSD BSOD\n\nA: I would start with running sysdiagnose every time the Mac becomes unresponsive. Once you have 5 to 10 events, you could start the process of troubleshooting this for a software issue, but if the problem is something that happens all the time, you will quickly start to notice a pattern to what and when this happens.\nIf it's an infrequent issue (and it is cured 100% of the time from a reboot), it's more of a resource exhaustion / rare bug and having detailed sysdiagnose snapshots is even more invaluable for teasing out what part of the software stack is getting stuck and causing the Finder / UIServer to mark the cursor as non-responsive.\nThe next time this happens, press the shortcut and start seeing if the logs can help you.\n\n\n*\n\n*How do you get system diagnostic files from OS X?\n\n*shift+control+option+command+. - You do have to wait for 5 to 10 minutes after pressing the key command before pulling the plug in some cases to let the tool finish. On a system where the CPU or IO or network isn't blocked, you can time how long a sysdiagnose runs by issuing it from the terminal: sudo date; time sudo sysdiagnose; date … and be sure to press enter after sysdiagnose warns you of what it will collect to start the collection.\nEventually, a Finder window will open showing the sysdiagnose report - or you will pull the power / forcibly shut down the Mac. Just knowing it was blocked to tight to not even be capable to run sysdiagnose is valuable troubleshooting information.\n", "Q: iPhone upgrade without deleting data I have a iPhone 4, which is IOS 4.3.3. Now i need to upgrade it to the latest OS version, WITHOUT deleting any data. I have not tried to update my phone contacts in the last few years fearing it would delete the data. Can someone help me out?\n\nA: Okay, let me walk you through it step-by-step. The first thing we'll need to do is sync. Then we will backup, and then put the new OS on.\nSyncing\n\n\n*\n\n*Take your iPhone and plug it into your computer (using the charging cable that came with it)(it should have a USB, and iPhone connector)\n\n*If iTunes does not automatically pop-up on your computer screen within 1 minute of pluging in, click the icon for iTunes on your computer.\n\n*In iTunes, your iPhone should pop-up after a few minutes. Make sure that you are syncing all that you will want when the whole process is over. Go to the different tabs on top to make sure that you are syncing apps, notes, calendars, etc... Once you know that you are syncing all that you want, you must look for the sync button (it should be located at the bottom-right of iTunes within your device \"Summary\" page). Click it.\n\n*To be extra careful, once the sync is over, you should click sync again (this will ensure that you have successfully synced your iPhone).\n\n\nBacking Up\n\n\n*\n\n*Now you will want to Backup your iPhone to make sure that you won't lose any of your note, calendars, and so on. To do this, click the \"Summary\" tab in iTunes which will display a picture of an iPhone. After this, scroll down to the \"Backups\" section of this page, and finally, click \"Back Up Now\".\n\n*Once this is done, you should probably do it again to ensure that your information has been successfully backed up. Just follow the same steps above.\n\n*Finally, move on to the step shown below.\n\n\nUpgrading iOS\n\n\n*\n\n*Now, in the same \"Summary\" page, scroll down to the \"Version\" section of the page. In here (IF YOU HAVE COMPLETED ALL STEPS ABOVE), click \"Check For Update\". In the window that appears, click \"Download and Update\".\n\n*Confirm all of the following prompts that appear (Terms and Conditions, and so on...), and let it do its thing.\n\n*Have a cup of Hot Chocolate and wait for the download to finish. Once this has occurred, confirm any other prompts that appear (if they do).\n\n*Watch a little TV while you wait for the OS to update into your iPhone.\n\n*Once it is done doing this, it will restore the information into your phone and do a sync automatically in order to put in your apps and everything.\n\n*Once you get any indication that it was finished (MAKE SURE THAT IT IS FINISHED)(IT USUALLY TAKES ABOUT A DAY FOR THE WHOLE PROCESS TO FINISH), unplug your phone and enjoy.\n\n*Take a break! Go to bed, have a cup of tea, whatever! You now feel wiped out, and wish you never had asked...Don't worry about it, you now have the latest iOS.\n\n\nA: Upgrades aren't supposed to delete data, but you can't really test if your data is corrupt, so you need to perform and test your backup if you fear losing data.\nYou might want to test your backup on a new device (borrow one from a friend) before your upgrade yours to see how your exact data does on the current \"latest\" OS.\nThat way you can wait or correct things (sync elsewhere, back up to paper, fix the corruption, etc…) before you upgrade.\nAgain, you could just upgrade and cross your fingers, but it's more about your data than the upgrade causing millions of people to lose data. Only the people with problems in their specific device or settings/data have issues when upgrading and it's hard to know if you are going to experience pain until attempting the task.\n", "Q: Any ideas why my Airport Extreme identifies itself as a Time Capsule in Time Machine?

Since you've done so much troubleshooting, it's going to be unlikely someone can drift in and point out an obvious flaw in your reasoning (but if they do - we might have a quick resolution.)\nThe real data missing is what you've done to isolate the issue. Can you summon this on demand? Does it happen immediately after a reboot?\nYou'll need to have some process to keep track of when the issue arises - once you have 5 to 10 events, then it's much easier to go over the system.log and top process listing to see if any patterns emerge.\nA single sysdiagnose is very hard to pinpoint a problem by a non-expert. Ten events where sysdiagnose was run and there is data on what was connected, what you were doing, and ten sets of detailed logs is often very easy to narrow down your specific issue.\n", "Q: How transfer iTunes playlists from two computers to same iPhone?

I see the grey screen with the apple logo and the rotating circle. After a minute or so I get a kernel panic. All peripherals except the Apple keyboard are disconnected.\nI tried booting from my install DVD, this gave a kernel panic too.\nWhen booting multiple times in safe mode, this is the last line on the screen: \"localhost mDNSResponder: Adding browse domain local\"\nWhat I already tried:\n-Downloaded and burned another Install DVD, same problem (first disc is original)\n-Switched the memory modules and booted with just 1 inserted\n-Ran the Apple Hardware Test, no problems found.\n-Replaced the DVD drive\n-Ran fsck -fy , no errors\n-Cleared the PRAM \nAny ideas?\n\nA: It is probably your video card.  The 2007 MBP's were prone to this.\nHere is how you can tell.  Download the Ultimate Boot CD.  Burn it to a DVD or a USB Stick\nYou will launch Linux with a ton of useful diagnostic tools.  Run everything, but especially the video display diagnostic tool.\nMine was throwing errors and I was able to definitively find the cause of the problem.  I was able to find a guy in Tampa that would upgrade the video card on the Logic Board for about $100.  I did the service and it worked great. MBP still running to this day. Let me know if you are interested and I will post his info.\n\nA: You can try clearing the Parameter RAM (PRAM).\nWhen you hear the startup chime, hold down Command-option-P-R  (yes, that's four keys) until you hear the chimes twice more.  See if that helps.\nYou can also verbose mode at boot.  At the startup chime, hold down Command-V. The screen should start displaying the boot log kind of like an old CRT terminal.  At some point, an error should get displayed and the boot process will stop.  Hopefully, the screen will not get erased with the gray screen, but will remain as it is so you can see what was happening when the panic happened.\n\nA: This is no doubt an issue with either your loaded kexts, logic board, or GPU. There isn't any other reason at boot-up for it to crash. I just had my logic board, batttery, trackpad, screen, and keyboard replaced and I'm still having kernel crashes.\nOSX El Capitan is by far the worst Macintosh OS I've experienced. \nAs someone above said, try clearing the pram, and reset the SMC.\nNOTE: A Firmware PW will prevent both from reseting.

It's been running like a champ for most of its life. However, within the past few months, I've noticed a considerable degradation in the speed and responsiveness of the computer as a whole.\nI figured this might be a disk problem - so I ran the disk utility and it produced no noticeable improvement after a repair. Then I figured it might be a RAM usage problem - and I monitor and purge my RAM as often as I can (although I've not had to do this in the past). I figured it may be a problem with the system files, so I reinstalled OS X.\nAfter all of that, the computer is still pretty slow. When I have only Chrome and iTunes running (with a handful of non-intensive small programs in addition), the computer will still operate at a snail's pace and use up almost all of its 4GB of RAM. \nI'm seemingly out of options to attempt to improve the performance of my computer to the level that it was about a year ago.

After that, the display never worked. Apple Stores and Authorized Repair places insist on me paying over $1000 for a full logic board replacement before they'll do anything else to it, so I've been using it as a desktop machine with an external display since then.\nSometimes I leave the computer's display propped halfway open to help with heat. It's been that way for days. Tonight I briefly had a USB hub go funky, with lights blinking that shouldn't have been blinking, so I restarted the computer.\nWhen it restarted, the years-dead display worked. But it didn't work perfectly; solid-white and solid-black areas flickered shades of yellow, green, and blue incessantly. But those flickering corrupted areas moved perfectly with app windows as I dragged them around, so I think it was some kind of corruption of the graphics data and not physically broken display pixels that I was seeing.\nI was elated, and started trying to fix the display. First, I rebooted. Didn't help; after the reboot it looked just as it did before. So, step 2, I zapped the PRAM.\nOn that reboot, the display stayed dark, just as it has for years. I zapped the SMC after that, and the display is still dark. Clicking \"Detect Displays\" in System Preferences doesn't help.\nI'm furious that this thing got my hopes up and immediately squashed them. Is there anything, no matter how complicated or technical, that I can do to make this thing acknowledge that display? I am 100% comfortable with the command line or anything even more arcane that I need to try.\n\nA: Well speaking of \"arcane\",and \"those kind of guys\" are still around, for clarity see the answer below :) \nSo what you need to do is open it, remove battery, and clean the mother board and plugs ect.... using NON metallic cleaning objects like toothbrush and q-tip. \nUse alcohol (for grease) and Vinegar(or pure lemon juice without sugar) for calk deposits from your spill. \nThe density of interconnects is very high and even a small amount of semi-conductive dirt can do what you are experiencing, so give it a good scrub.\nGood luck :)\n\nA: Years ago, an independent Mac repair guy opened up the case of a Powerbook on which I'd spilled a little coffee, poked very gently around with a q-tip, probably with alcohol on it, but maybe only water, cleaning up all the little dried granules he could see. \nNote that I am not recommending you do this, just passing along a story. \nHe also knew what wire went where--fixed several of my machines over the years. Are those kind of guys still around? Find one.\nThere used to be information on the web about bringing a \"dead\" Powerbook back to life. Google is, in this case, your friend.\n\nA: One thing with weird hardware errors (assuming it maybe one), is that they sometimes come and go randomly.  This can be pretty mean, because this randomness (a) usually coincides with something you do (b), because you're doing all kinds of things and it happens just during one of those.   Which makes you think (b) caused (a) (in your case PRAM reset caused it to break again).\nI'm not saying it's clearly a hardware error (it could be a broken or damaged flat wire or a thermal thing), just don't necessarily jump to conclusions about what caused what.\n", "Q: iPad typing by itself I have an iPad that I've been using for 9 months or so already. And I was using it just today (reading an article from the Internet) it accidentally flops (forgive my English) over my chest but when I open it up for reading again it starts to type by itself or at least it will not respond when I touch a button on the screen for example. \nI tried to turn it off (by pressing the two buttons) but once It shows the slider to finally turn it off. The slider does not badge at all. So, I forced to cancel the shutting down of my iPad and here it is again going back to typing by itself.\nAnd I was looking in the Internet and lo behold I am not alone. There had already been many case like this and it looks it has no solution at all for the moment.\nI am living in an island nation (actually group of islands) called Federated States of Micronesia and we bought it from the mainland (USA) and I know probably some of your suggestions would be to ask for replacement. However, it would take very long if ever I will be allowed to return it to them.\nSo, my question then is, does anybody has this similar experience or at least from someone that they know of? And is there any possible solution to this one?\nIt has almost the same problem as this video except that mine does not open an application but keeps on typing by itself when the keyboard is up or it just simply freezes that no matter where I touch on the screen it does not respond except if I press the Home button.\nAny good advice will be much appreciated.\n\nA: If you are typing, and it is not responding, but yet it starts typing by itself afterward, this is probably the effect of a slow down of your CPU or running out of RAM. When this happens, the keyboard does not show a key clicked, or a word typed until after you actually tapped the key.\nIn order to fix it:: try shutting down all open apps by double-pressing the Home button, holding down one of the apps until little red badges pop-up on all of them, and tapping that little red badge on each app until they all disappear.\nThen do a hard restart:: Hold down the Sleep and Home buttons until the device turns off, then hold the Sleep button until you get the boot screen to turn it back on.\nTest it out. Hope this helps.\nUPDATE\nIn newer versions of iOS, the method to shutting down applications has changed. Instead, your open applications appear as tiles that you may scroll left to right. Swipe each of these up to shut off all of your open apps.\n\nA: Not software! Hardware problem. Its either a problem with the digitizer ribbon cable and its connection or the tape is missing across the home button side of the digitizer and it is making contact with metal frame.  Reseting or reinstalling the os will NOT cure the problem.\n\nA: Shut down the Settings app, then all the other apps should work okay. There seems to be a problem with just that app. Unfortunately, you can't delete it and download a new one because it's an Apple app.\n\nA: Most likely the most recent operating system that was downloaded from the cloud is corrupted. You must download the operating system by plugging the iPad into a computer where the operating system is downloaded as a zip file and unzipped in the computer and transferred to the iPad by Cable\n", "Q: Facetime with more than one apple device Is it possible for four people to make a Facetime call with the following setup?\n\n\n*\n\n*one using an iPhone 4, \n\n*one using an iPad 2 (both of which have the same email address)\n\n*another two people who have independent email addresses\n\n\nA: Do you want to place calls between two iDevices using the same Apple ID?\nBy default, all devices connected to the same Apple ID utilize the primary email address associated with that Apple ID. This means they'll all ring if a FaceTime call is placed to that email address. It also means you can't place a class between two devices, just as you can't use one home phone to place a call to your house and answer it with another phone. But luckily, Apple has provided a rather easy workaround for placing FaceTime calls on the same Apple ID.\nTo place a FaceTime call between two of your Apple devices, you will simply need to add a new email address to one of the devices. This will allow FaceTime to differentiate between the two and place a call to a specific device.\nYou can add a new email address to FaceTime in the iPad settings. Simply select FaceTime from the left-side menu and tap your finger where it reads \"Add Another Email...\"\nOnce you add a new email address, you must verify it by going to that email's inbox. There should be an email waiting for you from Apple with a link that will verify the email address. \nSource - http://ipad.about.com/od/iPad_Guide/ss/How-To-Use-FaceTime-On-The-iPad_2.htm\n\nA: I don't believe so. I think at the moment, Apple's Facetime only allows a one-to-one chat. So 2 people using different Apple ID's. If they had group chat, they would definitely have posted it up on their website, with instructions on how to do it on their support site.\n", "Q: Where to get older bootcamp drivers? I recently partitioned my MBP 15\", early 2011 model, so I could run windows. I installed Windows XP and now I have no Wifi. I've installed the bootcamp drivers off CD of Snow Leopard and the disks that came with my machine. No luck, there are no wireless drivers.\nWhat I am planning to do is install Windows 8. How can I get wireless drivers on my XP partition? Or if I download windows 8 on my OSX and make a bootable flash drive and upgrade the os, will I have Wifi that way?\nThanks\n\nA: This website contains download links for the latest version of the Boot Camp WindowsSupport for older devices:\n\nFor Windows XP, Apple has provided Boot Camp Drivers Update v2.1 and v2.2 which…\n\nis intended only for use with Microsoft Windows XP and Microsoft Windows Vista running on a Mac computer using Boot Camp.\n\nBoth updates require Boot Camp 2.1. It also notes that…\n\nThis download contains complete copies of Boot Camp Windows XP Drivers (version 2.1). If you have Boot Camp drivers already installed, it will update them.  If you do not have any Boot Camp drivers installed, it will install version 2.1 drivers onto your already installed Windows OS.\n\nThis should fix your XP issue, since it contains the latest XP-compatible drivers. If not, your only option will probably be Windows 8 (or Windows 7).\nWith regard to installing Windows 8, Boot Camp 5 brings full Windows 8 support.\n\nA: I recently installed XP SP3 on an old MacBook Pro 1,1 15\" Core Duo (running OS X 10.6.8) for Boot Camp you must use the Snow Leopard original install/upgrade DVD (post XP install) which includes the Boot Camp 3.0.4 drivers for XP 32 bit.  AFAICT the Apple Boot Camp 3.2 \"update\" drivers are the last that were compatible with XP 32bit SP3 (note you must be running SP3 and install the 3.0.4 drivers off the OSX Snow Leopard DVD in XP post first boot in order to get everything working). \n\nA: Boot into Windows and insert Leopard DVD, you will see the Boot Camp drivers installer on the disk :-)\n", "Q: How to not compress inserted pictures in Powerpoint 2011 for Mac? I am trying to make a presentation for a conference, and am facing a problem that I cannot solve. I have a powerpoint presentation initially created with Powerpoint 2010 for Windows. I am facing picture compression issues as described here. In addition to this saving problem, that pictures become worse quality every time I save the file, I am experiencing problems while trying to insert files. All pictures are inserted blurry. This applies for emf, png and, pdf. The solution here does not work as pictures are still inserted in lower quality\nI see that it is possible to disable the feature in Advanced settings under Windows, but I cannot find these advanced settings from Powerpoint for Mac 2011. How can I import/insert pictures to Powerpoint in their original quality? How can I control the picture compression?\nI am working on Powerpoint version 14.3.2 and OS X 10.8.3\n\nA: In Word and PowerPoint for Mac 2011, you can change the compression behaviour for a placed bitmap image via the Format Picture ribbon. Double-click the image to bring that ribbon to the front, then click the Compress button and choose the option Keep Current Resolution. Or, choose File > Reduce Size to bring up the dialog box. This needs to be done before the presentation is saved with the newly placed image.\nIt's different for vector graphics from PDF files, which PowerPoint will simply convert into bitmap graphics and compress as soon as the presentation is saved with the newly placed PDF file. This can be avoided in MS Office by using vector graphics in the .EPS file format or in Microsoft's own .EMF format, which can be exported from most vector graphics editors, e.g., Inkscape, OpenOffice Draw, Adobe Illustrator, etc. (Beware: PDFs exported from bitmap editors like GIMP, Photoshop, or Pixelmator are not vector graphics images.) \n\nA: You might be out of luck if you do not have the originals, as you know now the 2010 was compressing the pictures.\nFirst save the picture to hard drive and open it with something like iPhoto.\nIf you like the quality there we can continue.\nIf you do not like the quality it is the end of the road, no advanced settings will help here. \nYou could report the picture file size here, like is it in 500k- 1Meg, or more or less than 100k.\nIn second case your only option is to keep the picture size as small as possible to retain the quality (resolution).\nEDIT:\nIf the pictures look good in original presentation then lets try this.\nDo not copy paste.\nUse presentation mode (full screen) and make a screenshot (press cmd+shift+4).\nYou will get a cursor allowing you to select the picture., and once you have done that it will save it. \nNow take look at that result first, and if happy then import it in to power point.\n\nA: Thanks to Buscar for making me to look more deeply into this. It seems that the preview/editing space in PP for Mac visually compresses the pictures (i.e. text is somewhat sharper than pictures, no matter how high quality they are). However, this difference disappears in the Slide Show mode. \n\nA: When using lineart, logos, etc from a vector file (not too complex), it is possible to use vector graphics in Powerpoint. Enlarge it 400% in illustrator and export it as a .WMF file. This allso works for other office applications.\nYou can also export vector graphics using the newer file format .EMF (However, there is stil issues exporting gradients and more complex artwork.)\n\nA: Actually I solved the problem by realizing that Powerpoint is really bad in compressing photos. I tried to insert a 20MB jpeg and it looked awful in my Powerpoint Mac 2011. I solved it by adjusting the resolution with Photoshop and then pasted it - the results are a huge improvement!\n\nA: I have the same problem. My workaround for this is: don't save to ppt or pptx, directly save as PDF after you insert the PDF figures. In that way, it can keep the best resolution and in vector format. \n", "Q: iTunes Helper still running even if it is off I want to disable iTunes Helper.\nI have remove it from Settings > Users & Groups > Login Items, but it's still running after restart.\nDid I miss anything?\n\nA: iTunesHelper will run if you open iTunes, or do something that opens an iTunes service.\nThe only way to completely disable iTunesHelper is to…\n\n\n*\n\n*Quit iTunes and remove iTunesHelper from Login Items.\n\n*Go to /Applications/iTunes.app/Contents/MacOS/\n\n*\n\n*You can use Finder's Go to Folder to go there - paste in the path as above.\n\n\n*Rename iTunesHelper.app to something else (e.g. iTunesHelper-disabled.app).\n\n\niTunesHelper should not run automatically now.\n", "Q: What Is Graphic Switching & Are There Reasons to Turn It Off? I was tinkering about in the System Preferences of my Macbook Pro yesterday, when I came across \"Automatic Graphic Switching\" within the Energy Saver pane as exemplied below:\n\nWhat exactly is Graphic Switching, and are there any reasons or instances when it shouldn't be automatically enabled & switched off ?\n\nA: Graphics switching is where the integrated graphics is switched for the discrete graphics when more performance is required (and where performance is more important than battery life & heat output).\nYou can see the current graphics card that is enabled, and forcefully switch between the two, with gfxCardStatus.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Integrated graphics should be used when you need battery life over performance (the Integrated Only option in gfxCardStatus can be used to force integrated graphics in circumstances where OS X believes that the discrete graphics is required).\n\n*Discrete graphics should be used when you need performance over battery life (this is usually not required to be set manually with the Discrete Only option since OS X is happy to switch automatically).\n\n*Dynamic Switching uses the default OS X graphics switching.\n\n\nWhen 'Automatic graphics switching' is disabled in the Energy Saver system preference pane, only the discrete graphics is used.\n", "Q: What determines the model name displayed in System Information compared to the model number? I've just purchased a used Mac Pro that was sold to me as a \"5,1\" model, which according to everymac.com and Apple's support site, should be a Mid 2010 Mac Pro. However the model display in System Information/About this Mac shows it as an \"Early 2009\", as does the Apple warranty check.\nIt does have the 3.2GHz Quad Core Xeon processor which was only available with the Mid 2010 model (again, according to everymac.com) and the latest firmware for the 5,1 Mac Pro. I'm not sure if the latter is an indicator though as some searches around the web suggest that it was possible to upgrade an Early 2009 model with the 5,1 firmware which should make it a Mid 2010.\nSo, I'm wondering if this is just a case of Mid 2010s reporting themselves as Early 2009 Mac Pros in general, or if this model has had both an upgraded firmware and upgrade processor?\n\nA: I think the model name shown in System Information is determined from information encoded within the serial number. It looks like the precise details of this are private to Apple, but some information is given in this MacRumors post (which includes the image below), and it looks like some sites may have reverse engineered it.\n\nBe aware it is possible under some circumstances to change the serial number reported to the software running on the machine. Specifically: logic boards supplied by Apple to service providers have a \"blank\" serial number, and service providers must \"serialize\" them (this is only possible once, from the service provider point of view) by running some special software and providing the desired serial number via keyboard input. (This is why I suggested checking the serial number printed on the hardware in my comment on the question.)\n", "Q: Making Hidden Apps Appear Faded Whilst Sitting On The Dock?

There have been many different questions like this and all have seemed to come down to the same answer. It violates the EULA. The problem is they all bring up another question. How binding is the EULA. We all know Psystar was sued for making machines with OSX installed on them. The problem is they were selling them. Not using them.\nNow what if you put it in a virtual machine and don't sell it. Is it still against the law? Apple has gotten sued before for taking their competitors apps off their market. Also Windows recently got in trouble for their secure boot which didn't allow people to install other OSs on hardware.\nHow legally binding is the EULA?\nIs there a legal way to do it?\n\nA: Snow Leopard Server specifically allowed installation in a VM.  Normal Lion and Mountain Lion also allow installation in the VM in the EULA.  Parallels and VMWare both support installation of Mac OS X guest machines for those versions.\nThe EULA only allows it if the VMs are running on Apple hardware.\n\nA: A EULA is a contract, not a law. Trouble, if it comes, comes in the form of a lawsuit: \"You agreed not to do X; you did X, harming me , for which I demand $$$ as compensation.\"\nThat means \n\n\n*\n\n*one party must have been harmed, and\n\n*would need to know or believe that they have been harmed, and\n\n*would need make a claim to that effect, and\n\n*would need to back up that claim, with evidence sufficient to\n\n*convince a judge (assuming the other disputes the claim).\n\n\nThe said party might not know that the EULA had been violated, might not be able to prove a valid contract existed, might not be able to convincingly show harm, or might not feel that it's worth the trouble to pursue, for example, one person experimenting on their own, vs. a training company running a dozen such VMs off a single user license.\nHow legally binding is a EULA that you haven't actually signed, but was assumed by the licensor based on your having made use of the software? Here I'm out of my depth. Shrink-wrap EULAs (the kind that claim to bind you once you open the package that contains and conceals them) have been known to have been invalidated. One might conceivably be able to convince a judge that ticking a box that says you agree to some referenced but not necessarily presented terms, doesn't constitute agreement. Or not. Do you feel lucky?\n(IANAL, TINLA, etc.)\n", "Q: install Lion on Imac with macbook-pro HDD copy Is it possible to do a new lion install on an imac if you copied/cloned the HDD of your macbook-pro (with CCC)?\nIn theory that is ofcourse, because it won't.\nThe installer log, mentions:\n\n\n*\n\n*missing of authentication module \"ConfigurationProfiles\"\n\n*unable to find service discovery callback for module \"PlistFile\"\n\n*and some more details\n\n\nis there something I can do to fix?\nWhat I can not understand is why a complete copy of the macbook will make my imac work again, but I can not do a fresh install?\nThis problem that I am trying to fix started out with the imac hanging in the grey screen. After that I try'd the normal things like cmd+R but it just did not install from the app store, wich led me to believe it was a hardware problem, bad sectors and all. But like I mentioned above, I am running lion now, but not the way I want to. I don't have anymore technical knowledge to understand this. I just did the apple hardware test. Appaerantly I have a HDD error 1291;\nUPDATE\nI researched the error from the apple test some more. Everything starting with MOT is related to the fan. I turned the computer off and pulled out the power cable. Then I hold the powerbutton for about 6 seconds. (read it somewhere, but I forgot the details). After a period of cooling of, I started again with the original SL DVD and it finally installed. The only thing was that I could not login for some reason. It also used the information from my previous attempts to install from the macbook copy. The login screen showed the computername of my macbook. CONCLUSION: This install still did not qualify as a fresh install. Next I erased the volumes again. This time I used the zero fill option. The next attempt to do  a install leaded to the same impossible error \"can not install on this HDD\". After reading some more in the install log and googling some more, the one thing that was keeping me curious and the log does not tell you that, is that the volume in diskutility shows \"ownerEnabled=NO\". It is not possible to change that in diskutility and as far as I know, not in terminal either. I made the change by using \"TargetDisk\" with my macbook. On the selected volume press CMD+I and change the setting in the bottom to Ignore ownership. Now I try'd to install Lion from my downloaded version right onto that volume. It took about 3 minutes. After I booted the imac without \"targetdisc\" It did not boot, instead you wil see a folder with a questionmark. Ok, the conclusion is that you cannot install lion when your booted from another computer. It just leaves an installfolder with some information if you inspect the volume.\nAfter this I tr'd to do an install from the SL DVD again. I was waiting for it to fail again, but to my surprise, I got a fresh install and now I am downloading the software updates to get to version 10.6.6 wich is the minimal required to upgrade to Lion.\nThis endavour has cost me 4 days altogether, but I am happy it is 4 houers before I had an appointment with the genius-bar and I had to carry the imac al the way to the store.\nBest thing I learnt from this, is to absolutely make a backup!\nBecause I cannot not with absolute certainty say it was because of the \"ownership issue\" because I did some other thing after, but I hope it can help someone being stuck like me.\n\nA: Method #1\nDo you have a Snow Leopard DVD? Install it on the iMac, make the Software Update, Download Lion from the App Store, Install it. Then boot the MacBook in Target Disk Mode and use Migration Assistant to import your Data to the iMac.\nMethod #2 (if iMac is capable of Mountain Lion => if not, use MLPostFactor)\nDownload Mountain Lion on the MacBook via App Store, boot the iMac in Target Disk Mode and install it this way from the MacBook. After Install worked, use Migration Assistant.\n", "Q: Automated transcripts of conference calls What's the best way to get an automated transcript of a FaceTime/Skype or simple audio conference call?\n\nA: A simple answer is NO.\nThere are lots of Dictation software but they really only work for Dictation (one person talking in a quiet room. \nEven than you have to train the software to your specific voice and how you pronounce stuff to get accurate text output\nYou can try to use them for transcription a conference call, but you will end up editing a lot.\n\nA: As Buscar notes, even the best dictation software isn't really going to work for transcribing a conversation. However, you might want to read this blog post by Andy Baio on how he uses Amazon's Mechanical Turk to get transcriptions done cheaply.\nThe gist is, take your recording and chop it up into small chunks (he uses 5 minutes), and create Mechanical Turk jobs to transcribe each one. It's not free, but it looks like it's substantially cheaper than other paid transcription services, and the work of getting the recording onto the site could be automated relatively simply.\n", "Q: No keyboard backlight until password entered Since updating to OS X 10.8.3 on my MBP, my keyboard backlight does not come on until I enter my password and my desktop comes up.  This makes it very difficult to enter my password at night with low light because the keys are not backlit.\nHow can I enable the keyboard backlight before password entry?\n\nA: Assuming you are FileVaulted, fold your screen down just short of crushing your fingers. The light is sufficient to illuminate the kbd enough to be able to enter your pwd.\n\nA: When FileVault is enabled it encrypts everything on the SSD and doesn't allow even the computer to have access to that data until you enter your password.

That is, to be able to send the mic input from the Bluetooth device out the jack and receive audio input from the same jack and route to the Bluetooth headphone.  \nBasically, the iPhone would receive the Bluetooth output, convert to analog and send it to the jack while simultaneously receiving input from the jack and converting to output for Bluetooth.  \nIs this physically possible on the iPhone hardware?\n\nA: No. \nThough you could conceivably write an app that would do this, there is no way to configure this given a stock iPhone. \n", "Q: Macbook pro evolution between 2011 and 2013 models Is there an easy way to understand how Macbook pros evolved from 2011 to 2013?\nIt seems (to me at least) that until the retina display was introduced there were no revolutionary changes in the macbook pro line between 2011 and 2013 (just incremental processor upgrades).\nAnother way to ask the question would be: would an i7 macbook pro from 2011 be able to hold her own against an i7 2013 model? (By hold her own I mean would say: a java developer notice any real difference).\nThanks.\n\nA: I would download the Mactracker app (runs on Mac and/or iOS) to compare the specs.  I've compared them briefly and those two models seem pretty similar to me, retina graphics aside.  I'm happily using a mid 2009 MacBook Pro for iOS development, although I've upgraded it with 8GB of RAM and an SSD.\n\nA: The big difference between the 2011 and non-Retina 2012 models (there are no 2013 models, as of May, 2013) is the move from Sandy Bridge to Ivy Bridge, along with updated discrete graphics in the 15\" model.\nThe Ivy Bridge processors bring a bit more speed, but more importantly for the MBP, they're more power efficient. That equates to improved battery life over the 2011 models, which is probably the most noticeable difference for everyday usage.\nDepending on the tasks and specific models of CPU, Ivy bridge will probably yield a 5-10% performance improvement.\nThe other big addition is USB 3, which is a nice thing to have if you want high-performance external storage without paying the high costs of Thunderbolt drives.\n", "Q: How to access data in iPhone backup file directly I have just gotten rid of my iPhone 5 but did a full  backup of picture and such beforehand.

I just want a clean, fresh installation of Mountain Lion, separate from my current one.\nCan 'Internet Recovery' install to a 2nd partition? or would it hose my default one in the process?\nBy using Disk Utility to re-partition the SSD, have i blown away the recovery partition that is apparently hidden away on the disk when it comes out of the factory? (when i hold down the option key on boot, it gives me the option to boot into recovery so i assume its still there?)\nWhat is the best way to create a fresh copy of OSX alongside the default one?\nIf have read that the App Store Mountain Lion is different from the pre-installed Retina one - is this still the case?  and if i did download it, would i have to pay for it?\n\nA: The best way is to boot into your current OS X install, and download the Mountain Lion installer from the Mac App Store. When the installer asks which drive to install to, select your second partition.\n\nInternet Recovery is different to the Recovery HD partition.\nGenerally…\n\nAs long as you have a valid Recovery HD partition, trying to boot into Internet Recovery will instead boot your Mac into standard recovery mode.\n\nBoth recovery modes download OS X anyway…\n\ninstalling Mountain Lion from within recovery mode requires an Internet connection to download the actual OS.\n\n…so I recommend using the Mac App Store to install Mountain Lion as I mentioned above.\n\nDisk Utility shouldn't let you remove the Recovery HD partition unless you are in Debug mode. It is unlikely that you have accidentally deleted the Recovery HD partition, and since you can select it when holding alt to select a boot drive, I doubt very much that it's gone.\n\nThe App Store Mountain Lion installer is the universal installer capable of installing on any compatible Mac.

If I open a Finder window to the Applications folder and search there for iPhoto, it doesn't show up either. Other applications are included in the results if I search for them (including iMovie and GarageBand).\nThe only folder in the list of folders to exclude from searching in the Spotlight Privacy tab is my Time Machine backup drive.\nI'm running 10.8.3.\nDo you know why iPhoto isn't showing up when I do a Spotlight search?

I paired my Apple Bluetooth keyboard with my Macbook Retina running 10.8.3 today, and noticed that my fan starting running really loudly.\nOpening Activity Monitor, it showed that a task, \"SystemUIServer\" was using between 80 and 90% of my CPU. Distnoted was also up there, using 10%. 60+ GB of swapfiles in private/var/vm were created, which was a huge size in comparison to my 250gb hard drive that only had 90gb free prior. (These were removed upon a restart)\nLooking at my menubar (a google search showed that SystemUIServer often has to do with menubar icons, I saw that my wifi icon was glitching a bit, frequently flashing. Clicking the icon, I saw that its status kept switching between \"Wifi: On\" and \"Wifi: Searching\", about five times per second. \nscreenvideo: http://f.cl.ly/items/3o0d1u2j0x2P1l33203Q/screenrecord.mov\nTurning Wifi off resulted in everything going back to normal. (With the exception of no wifi connection anymore)\nDoing some debugging, I found that turning bluetooth off and restarting the computer fixed the problem, up until I turned bluetooth back on, in which case the symptoms would immediately begin again.\nFurther debugging leads me to believe that it is specifically my bluetooth keyboard (I also use a magic mouse) causing the problems. Turning bluetooth on but remaining unconnected with the keyboard does not cause any problems. Connecting to the keyboard immediately starts the symtom, and disconnecting immediately relieves the symptoms.\nI had it connected with just the magicmouse, after about half an hour the problem started happening again...\nSorry for the wall of text, I just wanted to document everything about the situation. It may also be worth noting that I also started using Time Machine with an external hard drive right before this started, but I don't think it's related.\nAny ideas? I'd like to be able to use my bluetooth keyboard...\n\nA: Bluetooth and WiFi do use the same 2.4GHz1 frequency bands (as do many other things), so they could interfere relatively easily. It also doesn't help that there are a lot of networks in your area. However, I find it highly unlikely that the interference would cause you to lose your connection, given that the video shows a full 4 bars when you are connected.\nPersonally, I would suspect a hardware issue in this case. The Bluetooth and WiFi connections are most likely controlled by the same chip in your computer, so it may be malfunctioning only if both of its services are being used. Try reproducing the issue on someone else's wireless network, and take it in to an Apple Store if you can. If you cannot reproduce it on someone else's network, it may be that your router is picky with its connections, or something else completely.\n1 802.11n does allow using a 5GHz band instead, so you could try that if your router and computer support it. It isn't very commonly used yet, so there is typically little interference there.\n", "Q: How can I open all the files in all the subdirectories of a folder? I'm trying to recursively open all the files in a folder, including its directories. I've been playing around with open /path/to/folder/*, and this will open all the files inside that folder but not include the sub-directories. \nIf I had a folder tree that looked like this:\nFolder\n>subfolder1\n>>file1.jpg\n>>file2.jpg\n>subfolder2\n>>file1.jpg\n>>file2.jpg\n>subfolder3\n>>file.jpg\n\nHow could I open all the files in one terminal command?\n\nA: I would suggest \nfind . | xargs open\n\n", "Q: Mail app correctly marks spam but does not move it to the junk mail folder as by message, Mail app does not bother moving mail correctly marked as spam in the spam folder -- this only happen when I am at home, and only during the week-end.

I could try to delete the account and recreate it, but since it's my work email, and the server is showing some problems, I am quite lukewarm about this solution (Mail app problem in Lion).  Is there another less drastic way of solving the problem?\nI'm on OS 10.8.3 all latest whistles and bells.\n\nA: *\n\n*You need open the preferences window (command + ,)\n\n*Click on Junk Mail pane\n\n*Select: \"Move it to the Junk mailbox (Automatic)\"\n\n", "Q: How can I stream audio to multiple computers at the same time? I'm trying to stream music to different computer's speakers simultaneously. Currently I'm doing this by physically timing the start of the song on each computer. \nAre there any built in utilities or applescripts that will sync one instance of a song on two devices? I'll resort to commercial options if necessary but I'd prefer some nifty scripting.\nI have a 2006 Intel iMac and a 2012 Macbook Air.\n\nA: You can combine AirPlay in iTunes 11 and up with something like AirSever to accomplish this with good results and very little effort. (Note: For more options on how to turn your Mac in to an AirPlay receiver please see: Can I use a Mac Mini as an Airplay audio receiver?)\nInstall the AirPlay receiver software of your choice on the machine you want to stream audio to.\nStart iTunes on the machine you want to stream audio from. In the upper left hand corner of iTunes, right next to the volume slider, you'll see the output device selection icon. It looks like this:\n\nPress it and select the \"Multiple\" tab at the top of the screen. Select both \"Computer\" (which is the computer you're running iTunes on) and the name AirServer machine from the list.\n\nPlay something in iTunes and should play, simultaneously, on both machines.\n\nA: I've been using Airfoil to do this for years.  Only one Mac needs to have the music: it is streamed across the network to the other.  You need a reasonably well performing network for this to work well: sometimes my WiFi plays up and the audio can get a little out of sync as a result.  For me, it works best when using their software on both Macs (Airfoil on one, Airfoil Speakers on the other).  There is a small delay when you press play before the music starts, to enable a buffer to be built up.\n\nA: You can use VLC (free, open source, cross-platform): it has a feature to stream music/video across your local network, thereby allowing to be used to stream audio to multiple computers at the same time.  \nGuide:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Download VLC media player \n  \n*Install VLC on each computer you plan on streaming to or from.\n  \n*Open VLC on the main computer (the computer which has the files you want to stream). This computer will control all the streaming and file\n  playing.\n  \n*Click File, then Wizard. Select Stream to Network, then click next.\n  \n*On the input screen you can either use what is currently in the playlist or a saved file. You can select music files, video files,\n  discs, or even playlists. I chose to use a playlist. \n\n\n\n  \n*On the streaming screen select RTP Multicast. Next fill in the address you will be using. I used 239.255.100.100. Click next.\n  \n  \n  \n\n  \n*On the Encapsulation format use whatever is already selected, and then proceed to the next screen.\n  \n*On Additional Streaming Options in the Time-to-Live option put the number of how many routers you have. For example I have two routers,\n  one wired, and one wireless so I would put 2 in.\n  \n*Click Finish to start streaming. Note you will not hear the file playing, because we need to connect to the stream, which is the next\n  step.\n  \n*Open another instance of VLC. (You can do this on the same computer or different one.)\n  \n*Click File, Open Network Stream, and then choose UDP/RTP Multicast. Enter the address from step #6 (239.255.100.100) and leave\n  the port numbers alone. Click Ok and then you should hear/see the\n  music/video being played (may take a few seconds). Do this step for\n  each computer that wants to watch/listen.\n\n\n", "Q: disable iMessage on one or more devices but not all I have an iMac, iPad, a MacBook Air, and an iPhone.\nI want iMessages to work only on the iPhone.  How can that be accomplished?\n\nA: On the Macs, in Messages.app, go to the menu Messages > Preferences, select the Accounts tab, select your Apple ID in the column on the left (if it is there) and press the '-' button to remove it.\nOn the iPad, go to Settings, Messages, and turn off the iMessage switch there.\n", "Q: I can't delete a calendar event I did not create I have a calendar event that I did not create but is recurring.  I have declined the request, yet it still shows up on my calendar.  Because I did not create it, I can't delete the event.\n\nA: My first thought would be to disconnect the calendar (I'm assuming this is a shared calendar of some kind) on all your devices, and then reconnect the calendar to see if the reoccurring deleted event still happens. \nIf the event is still getting downloaded to your device and spamming you constantly, you may need to contact the creator of the event to remove it from the calendar or otherwise change some settings.\n(Is the calendar causing you problems using Exchange, iCloud CalDAV or Gmail CalDAV? I tend to find Gmail CalDav really finicky with iOS devices especially.)\n", "Q: MacBook screen very dark after resuming on OS X 10.8 I have a MacBook late 2008 aluminum model (5,1).

But... this issue can be difficult to diagnose whilst it is intermittent, so perhaps wait for a while and see if it gets worse (which is then not so good for you, but easier on a technician).\nIn the meantime: a minor suggestion -- instead of holding down the power button when you encounter the issue (which doesn't give the software a chance to clean up), try ctrl-alt-cmd-eject, which should shut down more safely.\nEDIT: I forgot one important thing -- try resetting the SMC, since I believe this controls power to the inverter.\n", "Q: Do I need to be concerned with timezones when creating events in my iCloud calendar? I live in California, and I need to enter over 20 events onto my calendar. These events are taking place on the east coast of the United States, which is where I will be during the events. How do I enter these events on my iPhone (to my iCloud calendar) so that the events list the correct times?\nIf I create an event beginning at 8pm and ending at 10pm for example, I do not want the event time to be shifted by three hours (going from PDT to EDT) when I travel. Since I am managing about 20 events on the calendar, it would be a hugely unpleasant task to update all of the events by hand.\nFor this example event going from 8pm to 10pm, do I:\n\n\n*\n\n*enter the event on my calendar as 8pm-10pm while in California\n\n*enter the event on my calendar as 5pm-7pm (which would be the local time in California of an event 8pm-10pm on the east coast using daylight saving time)\n\n*locate or change a setting on my iPhone that makes calendar events disregard timezones\n\n*do something else?\n\n\nA: If you have a number of events you want to enter and you have their times in another zone, it's very handy to use Calendar's time zone support.\nFirst, go to Calendar->Preferences, and click Turn on time zone support.\n\nThis will enable a dropdown in the titlebar of your Calendar window:\n\nYou can then use this menu to change the display of everything in your calendar to a new time zone.  Pull it down and select Eastern time (or whatever other time zone or city your event is in), and Calendar will convert all your times to that zone.\nAt this point, you can start entering events, using the times listed in the program for the event.  You will also see a new detail in the event detail popup:\n\nThis shows what time zone the event is in.  \nOnce you've entered all the events, turn the time zone back.  That will display all your events in your own time zone.  If you are syncing with your phone (which knows what time zone it is in) all the events will remind you at the right time.  \n\nA: Your calender knows the time zone you are in. I am east coast. If you want to get me on a conference call at noon your time, you send me an entry for just that, noon. My entry will be the correct time for me, 3PM. \nTo be clear, set the appt for the correct Cal time. \n", "Q: MacBook Air 2012 Mini DisplayPort not working with HDTV I'm trying to connect my 2012 11\" MacBook Air to my Panasonic p60st60 1080p plasma HDTV using a new Monoprice Mini DisplayPort to HDMI adapter & 6' HDMI cable.\nMy TV displays a \"No signal\" message and my Mac does not show a secondary display option under System Preferences > Displays. I thought it was a handshake issue so I turned off the TV and Mac, turned on the TV, turned on the Mac, but the problem persists. \nAny ideas to get this working? Thank you.\n\nA: I have exactly same set up down to the MBA 2012 + Adapter and Cable. \nIt has been working flawlessly since.\nSo far I used it on 3 different TV models.\nIn your case I would say it is the adapter, they tend to be flaky (what do you expect for $6).\nBut, you can take a look in the Console and see what the \"Windoserver\" is doing when you plug in the cable.\nIf you live in the USA, go to store like Best buy or Walmart, get another adapter and try it. If it works you have your proof. If it does not just return it to the store for full refund.\n\nA: What happens to me sometimes is that it seems like it is connected yet applying a little more pressure will start the connection. depending on your tv \"no signal\" might switch to \"detecting\" stop applying pressure and enjoy your tv. I have research a lot and it seems as if the OS will get confuse easily before buying a new cable or adapter try testing them if you can.\n\nA: You have to unplug it and replug it. May take more than a few attempts but give it 5 seconds or so before trying again. Problem still happens even on later models. \n", "Q: What is the server URL thru which Apple updates occur?

In a picture I took this afternoon with my iPhone 5 I noticed a purple line on the photo:\n\nAt first I thought it was a software issue so I rebooted the phone. Unfortunately, after a reboot the line was still there on new photographs.\nUpon closer examination it appears that the rear lens of my iPhone 5 has somehow become scratched. Is there a way to fix this?

The camera lens is cheap. But it takes much time to replace the scratched one:\n\n\n*\n\n*Tear down the front LCD screen\n\n*Tear down all the small parts, battery, motherboard, dock flex cable, and camera etc\n\n*Use a heat gun to heat the camera lens, use something to make the lens out\n\n*Use Glue to glue to new lens on the original position of the back housing\n\n", "Q: Downgrading from 4.2.1 to 3.1.3 I have an iPhone 3g and I'm trying to downgrade it from 4.2.1 to 3.1.3.\nI downgraded it successfully and use redsn0w to boot it.

I use Pocket and I love it as a way of saving articles to read them later, and how it allows me to browse, search, and read them easily. \nHowever, when I read articles, I like to create highlights (in yellow) and add annotations. Pocket doesn't offer highlighting. \nThere's a great OSX app for PDFs, Skim, that highlights and annotates perfectly when I'm reading a PDF. But it would be so much better to not have to convert a web page to PDF in order to highlight and annotate it. \nI would like to be able to create my own library of archived web articles (like Pocket allows me to do) that I can tag, search, and mark up. \nIs there a \"read it later\" type app that will allow me to create my own library of archived web articles that I can then highlight and annotate?\n\nA: A recent update of Instapaper (May 8, 2014) allows highlighting. Any highlights you create are saved into your saved version of the article and are visible online as well.\n\nA: Yes there is.

Apple's support article states that you can only connect one non-Thunderbolt monitor per Thunderbolt port.\nAdditionally, you can look at hooking a second screen up via USB, using a product like those made by DisplayLink.\n\nA: There recently was a similar discussion here at Ask Different:\nTwo Monitors Setup On a MacBook Pro\nThe MacBook Pro described in that post has similar options/limitations as your MacBook Air when it comes to multi-monitor setups.\n", "Q: Received a FaceTime call from unknown person I have received a FaceTime call from unknown source. I'm not sure who this person is, nor do I know the caller's email.\nWhat can I do? I don't want unknown people contacting me. It was from an iCloud email address.\n\nA: Block that caller!

In the case of Lion and Mountain Lion, the default is MacOS Extended (Journaled). Case-sensitivity at the disk level can mess with certain apps, and the OS makes it look like files are indeed case-sensitive when you interact with them on the command line.\n\nA: The article you have seen the non-journaled options in (mentioned in your comment) seems to be talking about 10.6, so I think this option has been removed since.\nIn my experience, enabling journalling doesn't affect accessibility from Linux or Windows:\n\n\n*\n\n*If your external disk is plugged into your Mac and those other platforms are accessing your data across the network, the journalling isn't visible to them.\n\n*If you are plugging your external hard disk directly into a Linux or Windows machine, they will need some (probably additional) software to provide access to the (non-native) MacOS Extended format drive... and journalling has been around for quite some time now, so I'd expect most software to implement it (apologies for the handwaving here).\nI agree with @MattDMo's answer: I'd say use the default Mac OS Extended (Journaled) if you will be using the drive with Macs only, and MS-DOS (FAT) otherwise (which is fine for storing data, although not really applications without special measures).\n", "Q: How do I search Mail.app by country code? I want to look at just the emails sent to me from the .ru (or any other domain code), and I'm not having ay luck. Searching from:.ru orfrom:\".ru\" doesn't work. A wildcard approach doesn't work either. Anybody out there know the trick?\n\nA: You can make a smart mailbox where \"From\" \"ends with\" \"ru\".\n\nA: Just type .ru in the search box, hit enter, then click the Any drop down that appears and change it to From.\n", "Q: Customize delimiter character with Excel CSV save-as Is there any way to do this?  I need to use a pipe \"|\" as my delimiter.  On Windows you can change this during the export.  On Mac I haven't found a way. As a side note, my files have commas in the data itself.\n\nA: If you're willing to move away from Excel, you could try using OpenOffice or LibreOffice to create .csv files. They're both free, they both have most of the functionality included in Excel, and they both allow tabulated data to be saved as a .csv file using any character as a data separator or text delimiter (including the pipe, of course).\n\nA: Well, wouldn't you know it, I don't need this functionality anyhow.  Excel is smart enough to detect cells that have commas in them, and in this case, it will automatically delimit the text with surrounding double quotes.  I wasn't giving Excel any credit!\n\nA: All well and good, but don't try to use low level text file manipulation utilities on the files that you create (ie *IX programs like awk). They won't be able to distinguish commas inside quotes from those without. Pipe delimiters are better as they clash less frequently with normal everyday usage (eg commas in addresses, or as separators in numbers).\n\nA: I typically use TextEdit to do something like this. Open the source data in TextEdit and go to Edit > Find > Find & Replace. Then replace | with ,, replacing all instances. Save the file using an extension of .csv and you are now good to import into Numbers or Excel.\n", "Q: URL of calendar running on mac server (to subscribe in google calendar) I am running OS 10.8 server on a mac mini. I have the calenddar service enabled and created an extra user for calendars.\nI have no problem subscribing to those calendars by creating an OSX server account on other macs using the \"Mail, Contacts & Calendars\" setting in system preferences.\nIs it possible to subscribe to such a calendar online, using google calendar? Google Calendar has an option to \"add via URL\" (right click on further calendars at the bottom left) -- how can I figure out what the URL of my calendar is?\n\nA: Subscribing to a Calendar and accessing a Calendar account are two very different things. As you mentioned above, you can access this calendar from a Mac by visiting \"Mail, Contacts & Calendars\". However, to subscribe to a calendar there is a slightly more involved process.\nFirst, go to your primary Mac that you use this account from. Open the Calendar or iCal app. Locate the calendar you'd like to access from Google from the Calendars sidebar. Right-click this calendar and select Publish... You can now enter a website U RL, user ID and password, choose your settings and click \"Publish\" to publish your calendar.\nTake the URL that it published to and you can now subscribe to this published calendar in Google Calendar (via add via URL).\nKeep in mind... when you publish a calendar, it essentially sits on a Web Server. That means you will need to have a web hosting provider to publish to. If you do not, you can always start the Web Service on your OS X Server and publish to that.\n", "Q: Is TimeMachine Apple's System Restore? I have recently moved to Mac from Windows. Rarely I find that I may have to use System Restore to fix an issue that the OS has incurred. What I would like to know is whether Time Machine is the Mac equivalent to this feature?\nI do not need Time Machine file backups itself as I already make regular backups using rsync. But if Time Machine can also backup the OS will use it.\n\nA: Yes, TimeMachine is Apple's way of doing backups (both user, and whole system, as long as you aren't excluding system files).\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/ht1427\n", "Q: Not able to send emails through Microsoft Outlook on iPhone I use Microsoft Outlook as my email client but I also have separate Gmail account on my iPhone 4S which has no problems sending or receiving emails. On my Outlook account at home I can always receive and send emails but only receive from my iPhone. When sending a message from my iPhone it says that the recipient has been rejected by the server. \nIt keeps trying to send but keeps rejecting. \n\nA: There are two methods for adding an Outlook account to your iPhone:\nIn the Mail, Contacts, Calendars --> Add account section of the Settings app:\n\n\n*\n\n*When adding the account you select \"Hotmail\" (Outlook) and type in your email and password.\n\n*You select \"Other\" and type all information required.\n\nUnless its too hard and it may delete something that you need, delete the mail account, and create another one using the opposite method of how you originally created it.\nThis may help. (If it does, upvote or confirm)\n\nA: When you add an account to your email accounts, have you entered the correct information?\nI have my work email address connected through MS Exchange fine, and is on my iPad.\nEmail: sample@outlook.com\nServer: mail.outlook.com\nDomain: outlook.com\nUsername: sample@outlook.com\nPassword: *****\nDescription: Outlook Emails\nUse SSL: On\n\nObviously, you replace the details with your own.\n", "Q: How do I read this Activity Monitor report? I was trying to figure out why my Mountain Lion server was running slow, and I when I opened Activity Monitor this is what I saw:\n\nQuestion 1: how am I getting >400% of CPU on the summed CPU column, when I only have 4 cores available?\nQuestion 2: given that I have all this CPU activity, how am I getting these usage reports in the lower-left corner, esp. the 38% idle one?\n\nA: Check this out for a previous post. But, adding a bit to that answer...\nFirst - while you have 4 physical cores, you have hyperthreading active, which allows each core to serve as 2 virtual cores. This will give you a theoretical maximum CPU usage of 100% x 8, or 800%.\nSecond - the % reported in the activity monitor is showing total CPU% (so it won't exceed 100%). Looking at the CPU numbers in your table, you're using a bit more than 485% out of the maximum of 800%. 485/800 is about 60%, which is your total usage reflected here...\n", "Q: Transferring an iTunes library between Apple IDs, users AND computers? Okay.\nSo I finally got my own MacBook Pro after a few years of sharing my mother's Mac. I have my own Apple ID and everything. The thing is... I spent hours, if not Days uploading music onto her computer from legitimate sources and hard-copy CDs. I named, cataloged, sorted and optimised my playlists and I do not wish to do such a thing again, especially considering this MacBook Pro has no built in disk reader.\nI understand that I can 'share' libraries with my mother's computer, but that only seems like a short term solution as I only have access to said library when I'm in close proximity to her Mac, and I see no way of simply transferring the data.\nIs there a way that I can transfer an iTunes Library from one Apple ID to another over separate computers?\n\nA: If it's music you ripped yourself, or is otherwise DRM-free, you can just copy the iTunes library and files over to the new computer via networked file sharing, or a USB hard drive or similar. When you open iTunes it should read the library files and load everything automatically.\nApple's support article on moving your music to a new computer should be exactly what you need.\n\nA: If your iTunes library is anything like mine and is somewhere above 200GB, I recommend doing a firewire transfer from one computer to the other. If your computers have different firewire plug shapes, the adaptors are relatively easy to find in big box electronic stores. I found mine at Best Buy.\n\nA: Apple has a very detailed article on this:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204318\nIt includes the authorization, purchase / download aspects in addition to how to step by step move the files and library itself.\n", "Q: iOS Mail uses wrong return address tl;dr: I have several email addresses on the same Mail account, iOS defaults to the wrong one as the sender, and I can't figure out how to change that.\nFull version:\nI set up my email accounts on my Mac. In Mac OS X Mail's Accounts prefs, it's possible to list several email addresses for an account in a comma-delimited list. I do this, and it works well on the Mac. In the Composing prefs in Mail, I set Send new messages from to my primary email address, and that's the one that gets used by default.\nOn iOS, Mail uses a different email address in the From and Reply-To headers. (It's an address I only use for email to/from Yahoo groups). I haven't been able to find anything like Mac OS X Mail's Send new messages from setting, so I don't know how I can change this. As a result, email from iOS defaults to having a return address that I really don't want it to have. I only get the preferred address if I remember to change it, every single time.\nDeleting the address isn't an option-- I do actually use it, sometimes.\n\nA: iOS Mail app doesn't function like you are hoping it will unfortunately. The best suggestion I have is to add this mail account twice in iOS Settings, once using each email address you prefer it to have.\n", "Q: Is there a way to find the age of a specific Mac?

Please recommend something that's as minimalist as the iMessage app, not a big flashy mess.\n\nA: There is no app that can manage SMS/MMS as well as your other instant messaging networks. You will need to use Messages app for iMessage & SMS/MMS, and a third-party app for any other IM networks (such as AOL, Google Talk, Yahoo!, etc.).\n", "Q: Daisy-Chaining a DVI Monitor on a Thunderbolt Display? I currently have a mid-2012 MacbookPro that is connected to a 27\" Thunderbolt display. I also have a 17\" Samsung Syncmaster that only has VGA & DVI port on it. So I bought the MiniDisplay-to-DVI converter and tried hooking it up to the TBD's thunderbolt port. \nIt didn't work. The TB port doesn't recognize the monitor at all. When hooking the monitor up directly to the MBP, it seems to work fine. Are there compatibility issues when using the MiniDisplay-to-DVI converter?\n\nA: I would just like to chime in here and note that it is possible to get that DVI display to daisy-chain, but the caveat is that you have to put another Thunderbolt device in between the Thunderbolt display and the Mini DisplayPort->DVI converter.\n\nApple's notes one other caveat about the Thunderbolt display: older\n  Mini DisplayPort displays won't light up if they're hooked directly\n  into the Thunderbolt port on the newer LCD. Macworld's testing found\n  that Mini DisplayPort LCDs can be added to a Thunderbolt chain and\n  work as normal by hooking them into another Thunderbolt peripheral.\n\nSee: http://www.tuaw.com/2011/09/18/thunderbolt-display-daisy-chaining-spec-cleared-up/\n\nA: The Mini DisplayPort to DVI converter will only work when plugged directly into the MacBook Pro. You cannot plug it into a Thunderbolt Display for the purpose of daisy chaining. See this support article for details. Your only option of powering two displays via Thunderbolt alone is to purchase two Thunderbolt Displays.\nDo you have a Retina MacBook Pro? If so connect the Syncmaster via the laptop's HDMI port. It should work (in theory) using an HDMI to DVI cable.\n\nA: Indeed you can run 2 physically connected non TB displays plus a TB display from a retina with adapters. I have one TB to DVI and a HDMI to DVI that hang 2 24\" Samsungs off the MBP with the additional TB port being used by a TB display.  In addition I use my iPad as a 4th monitor with the Air Display app.\n", "Q: Date Taken changed to Import date in iPhoto I am not seeing the answer for this problem - I imported 14K photos from my PC to Mac, had them ready and cleaned up, no dups, etc., then after importing, most of the photos do not have the correct date taken, which causes a lot of problem to viewing all my photo. It is taking the date created as the date taken. I cannot seem to change anything else about it. With all pictures I have, I renamed ALL of them to the date taken in the format 2013-0520-xx, just so I would be able to keep up with them in the transfer. So I am able to know the date by the file name stored outside of iPhoto. Then I ran iPhoto for the first time, and everything is a mess without a way to fix it. HELP\n\nA: The problem is most likely, that your original photos didn't include timestamps. So iPhoto changed the date to the day you imported it. You have to use ExifTool or Lightroom or any tool that can edit EXIF metadata correctly and then import the files again.\n", "Q: Unable to enable PHP in OSX 10.8 mountain lion I have enabled php according to PHP's instructions and uncommented,\n#LoadModule php5_module libexec/httpd/libphp5.so\n\nin /private/etc/apache2/httpd.conf.

Does an account has to be logged on to trigger the Time Machine backup, or does Time Machine run without any session active?\n\nA: Time Machine is a system-level daemon, not a user-level process. Time Machine will work even if you are not logged into your Mac.\n\nA: No. Mac OS X doesn't mount external drives so even if backupd was told to back up from an ssh session using tmutil startbackup the external drive that Time Machine normally uses would be absent and the backup would fail.\n\nA: It is possible for the disk to be mounted while all users are logged out, but MacOS and other backup programs do not incorporate this feature.  The only one that can mount drive with no one logged in is CarbonCopyCloner.  Of course, it's not as simple as time machine.\n", "Q: Does TimeMachine has an higher priority than the sleep delay? When a long backup will soon occur or is running, will it go on and end even if the enter-sleep-mode settings is foreseen earlier?\n\nA: There is a sleep assertion for Time Machine.

I could not get the keyboard shortcuts for zoom in/out in Aperture 3 on my Swedish Keyboard.\nAccording to the documentation it should be Command+= and Command+-\nI have searched the Internet, but it only shows the same as above.\n\nA: Firstly, I'd check which keyboard shortcuts are documented for zoom in/out in the relevant menu.  My View menu (in Aperture 3.4.4) is as shown below: note the keyboard shortcuts to the right of the menu option.\n\nI read that '=' is shift-0 on a Swedish keyboard.  On my UK keyboard, '=' has a key to itself (pressing shift-= produces '-'), so I'd guess that the issue is to do with the shift key.\nSo, secondly, a different approach -- if we can't work out how to generate this key combination on a Swedish keyboard, I'd suggest changing the keyboard shortcut.  To do this, go to Apple menu > System Preferences > Keyboard > Keyboard Shortcuts.  Select Application Shortcuts on the left.

I have read otherwise (I forget where) but wanted a definitive answer. \nI would love to be able to buy all my movies, tv shows, etc from iTunes, store them DRM free in the cloud for my devices and watch them on my TV (Apple TV / XBMC).

Is anyone aware of any legal alternatives that would give me a good legal argument for storing MP4 copies of my (legally purchased) movies and TV shows in the cloud?\nThanks!\nEdit: I'm in the UK, but interested in UK and US options.\n\nA: There are currently no major options for getting legal access to DRM-free video content. Your main options are to download videos with DRM (i.e. iTunes), stream videos with DRM (i.e. Netflix), illegally download movies without DRM (i.e. The Pirate Bay) or stick to watching obscure independent art house films, which you can sometimes find available to purchase with no DRM.\n", "Q: How do I virtually disconnect an external monitor? I have a iMac that is connected to an external monitor to extend my screen. Into that same monitor I have a separate Windows box that I need to run sometimes. The Windows box goes in through VGA and the iMac through HDMI. The problem I'm running into is that when I want to use the monitor for Windows, there is no simple way to get my iMac back to just that monitor. If I leave it extended, some apps are open in the other 'monitor' and I can't access them without work arounds. If I turn on mirroring, the resolution on the iMac drops significantly, even if I tell it to keep the iMac screen size. I can't turn the other monitor off as that defeats the point. I have to unplug the HDMI to get it to perform correctly. Is there any way (command line, an app, preferences, etc) to toggle between using the display and not on my Mac?\n\nA: There is no way to \"virtually\" disconnect a display on a Mac, like you can on Windows. The Mac needs to disconnect physically. The easiest way to do this is by purchasing an inexpensive KVM Switch, to physically switch between the Mac & PC.\n\nA: This similar question has an answer that refers to SwitchResX.  The marketing information for that application says SwitchResX can let you disable an unused Display.\n\nA: Use VLC player to play your movies.

MacOSX contextual menus allow me use Pocket [Formerly Read it later] to archive all, and also read, some of the enormous amounts of content that I come across daily on my browser of choice - Safari. \nOn iOS [iPad/iPhone] however, the native 'Add to Reading List' feature for Safari is the most tightly integrated option when 'long-clicking' a URL in many different apps, like Mail [all newsletters with links]. This has caused a lot of grief for me as half on my links are saved to the Safari Reading List, and half to a Read-it-later service like Pocket. \nConsolidating it in a seamless way when using iOS is a challenge if you wish to avoid opening the webpage in safari first, then clicking a bookmarklet, etc. \nWeb-based trigger services like 'IFTTT' are only useful when the content has already made its way to Cloud services that it supports, like Pocket, Evernote etc.\nOne conceptual solution to this problem could be something along the lines of having a script run on my mac that is periodically looking for new items in the 'Reading List' plist file and extracting the url when it sees a new item added [since iCloud syncs iOS and MacOSX Safari]. Perhaps Alfred or some other automator service could then get it to a spreadsheet on the cloud which can then sync with IFTTT and Pocket etc. \nMaybe this particular design is not technically feasible or outright wrong, but I would be really grateful if someone with more expertise or nous could suggest an implementation or similar solution.\nTL;DR\nHow can I sync Safari's 'reading list' URLs to Pocket/Evernote etc automagically?\n\nA: I had this same idea a few months ago. I came up with a solution that works, using Ruby.\nI use this gist to parse the Safari Reading List plist file:\nhttps://gist.github.com/andphe/3232343\nThen I use the ruby Pocket gem to add each item to Pocket.\nIn the end, I went with Pinboard instead of Pocket, and I have a working project up on github that does exactly that, except using Pinboard.\nThe example code that you'd benefit from is:\nhttps://github.com/prokizzle/pinboard_tools/blob/master/lib/srl_to_pinboard.rb\nWhat you'd ideally do to make it automatic is have Hazel monitor the Safari Reading List plist file for changes, and then run the ruby script if it's recently modified. That way, every item will make it from SRL to your read later service of choice.\nHope that helps.\n\nA: I use the same bash command as Neglectogram above, but used it within a somewhat primitive script I wrote, which uses Pocket's \"add by email\" solution as outlined in the other answer to this post. I go in to detail here as there seems to be a demand for a solution to this and such I want even novice users to be able to use this (if it works properly).\nMy script focuses specifically on Evernote and Pocket as asked, but would work with any service which has the same \"email your content in\" feature.\nThe result is as desired, whereby the script: \n\n\n*\n\n*extracts all of the links in the reading list (BUG: takes all\nbookmarks from Safari, so I temporarly deleted all my bookmarks and\njust left the reading list, not ideal I know but it works).\n\n*Iterates over each of these links and sends them to Pocket/Evernote/whatever service individually.\nTo use the script yourself:\n\n\n*\n\n*Simply open it up in any text editor and replace the email addresses with your Pocket/Evernote account email address depending on which service you want to use and the recipient email addresses with Evernote or Pocket \"email in to us\" URLs. (Change addresses on lines 11, 13 and 14 to your own).\n\n*If just using Pocket, you need to send FROM your Pocket account email address TO add@getpocket.com\n\n*If using Evernote, you can send FROM any of your email addresses TO your specific Evernote Email Adress.\n\n\nHere is the script I wrote below... (note, I am using Mac OS X, and as such this is a bash script and may not work on other OSs)\n#!/bin/bash\n# Script to export Safari's reading list into a text file, then import this into Pocket or Evernote (or any service with a \"email in content\" feature).\n\n# First take all of Safari's Reading List items and place them in a text file.\n/usr/bin/plutil -convert xml1 -o - ~/Library/Safari/Bookmarks.plist | grep -E  -o '<string>http[s]{0,1}://.*</string>' | grep -v icloud | sed -E 's/<\\/{0,1}string>//g' > readinglistlinksfromsafari.txt\n\n# Now loop over each of those URls within that text file and add them to pocket.\nwhile IFS= read -r line\ndo\n    echo $line\n/usr/sbin/sendmail -i -f {{CHANGE THIS insert your pocket account email address here}} {{CHANGE THIS TO EITHER add@getpocket.com OR YOUR EVERNOTE EMAIL ADDRESS}} <<END\nSubject: $line\nFrom: {{ CHANGE THIS to your pocket account email if using Pocket, otherwise any of your email accounts will do.}}\nTo: add@getpocket.com {{ OR IF USING EVERNOTE YOUR EVERNOTE EMAIL ADDRESS}}\n\n$line\nEND\ndone < readinglistlinksfromsafari.txt\n\nAbove is the template for you to change, and below is the exact script I used, complete with email addresses for Pocket, to act as an example.\n(On Mavericks, this send to pocket ALL element in Bookmarks.plist, then also Bookmark)\n#!/bin/bash\n# Script to export Safari's reading list into a text file, then import this into Pocket or Evernote (or any service with a \"email in content\" feature).\n\n# First take all of Safari's Reading List items and place them in a text file.\n/usr/bin/plutil -convert xml1 -o - ~/Library/Safari/Bookmarks.plist | grep -E  -o '<string>http[s]{0,1}://.*</string>' | grep -v icloud | sed -E 's/<\\/{0,1}string>//g' > readinglistlinksfromsafari.txt\n\n# Now loop over each of those URls within that text file and add them to pocket.\nwhile IFS= read -r line\ndo\n    echo $line\n/usr/sbin/sendmail -i -f myemailaddress@gmail.com add@getpocket.com <<END\nSubject: $line\nFrom: myemailaddress@gmail.com\nTo: add@getpocket.com\n\n$line\nEND\ndone < readinglistlinksfromsafari.txt\n\nI hope this works for you all, and you find it helpful as this is one of my first public scripts etc. Any question just let me know!

On average, especially if your machine gets used quite a bit; I would recommend restarting your Mac (or any computer for that matter) at least once a week. A lot of it depends on how you use your Mac.\nIn the end, if you're Mac isn't a server, then restart it every once in awhile. \"Always-on\" is meant to be for Servers, and even then, servers have to be restarted from time to time.\n\nA: No, with the exception of restarts for software updates, shutting down your iMac or Mac Mini is not necessary. You are quite correct that you can put your device to sleep for long periods of time or even leave your device up and operating without causing any damage to the device, so long as proper precaution is taken to ensure surge protection for your electronics.\nAn even better solution would be to provide some form of backup power supply with a USB link to your device that works in OSX so that when a power loss is detected the device will shut down properly for you to be able to resume your uptime later. Most servers or datacenters have operated this way for years already, and the difference between the service life of servers and home hardware has come increasingly closer over the last decade. The days of the recommendation being to shut your PC down whenever you aren't at it are becoming increasingly out-of-date.\n\nA: It's mostly a personal preference at this point I think.\nI'm happy leaving my 2012 iMac on all the time. I sleep it overnight and any time I'm away from my desk for more than a few minutes. The power consumption during sleep is extremely low; by Apple's data, only 1.03 watts, versus 0.22 W for power off (on the 27\" model). Even idling it's a pretty efficient machine.\n\nA: The benefits of shutting down vs. sleeping is an oft-asked question. Over time, reasons to prefer shutting down have either been resolved or significantly ameliorated.\nFor instance:\n\n\n*\n\n*It used to be that shutting down early macOS (then OS X) machines caused issues with timed log clean-up routines. This has been resolved with the OS recognizing when routines haven't run and rescheduling them.\n\n*Similarly, long-running systems used to exhibit instability relating to memory issues. Shutting down the computer cleared the memory, temporarily resetting things. However, memory management has subsequently improved in later versions of macOS and this is no longer a significant issue. \n\n*A shut down system used to be significantly cheaper. However, advances in hardware and software have improved the ability of Macs to sleep efficiently. In 2020, a 27\" iMac with Retina 5K draws 0.27W when shutdown and 1.25W when asleep (compared to 40W when idle) (source). Apple prepares environmental reports on all its devices extending back several years that you can check. Copies are available from the Environment section of Apple's website.\nIn addition to these changes, features like Power Nap improve the utility of sleeping Macs.\nFor me, I set automated sleep and wake times and almost never reboot.\n\nA: I apologize for necroposting (old thread) but I am compelled to correct one critical fact.  I agree that it is generally fine to let your modern Mac run while leaving sleep and energy management to the operating system. \nBut...\nApple does not call \"Shutdown\" \"Idle\"!  From Apple directly we have: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201897\n\n\n*\n\n*Power consumption data (Watts) is measured from the wall power source and includes all power supply and system losses. Additional correction is not needed.\n\n*\"Max\" is defined as the maximum possible power draw based on the computer's power supply rating.\n\n*\"Idle\" reflects the power used with only Finder open, using the default power management settings.\n\n\nTomRou read that page that he quoted incorrectly. \n“You can read more about this on Apple's site and select the report for your Mac.”\n\nA: It's not necessary... and, speaking about power consumption, it has ho sense (iMac). It was big disapoitment, when I realize (by meter), that iMac (2011) consumes 9W in sleep mode, but also 9W if it is OFF – so you have to unplug it, to have 0. Nine W – that's like one small energy-saving light bulb... :(\n\nA: I have an older iMac it only draws 2W @ 240V AC once it is in sleep mode. I suspect your system is pulling closer 0.9W you may want to check it with a more accurate meter. \nWhen my system is shutdown it is pulling well under 1W @ 240V AC\n\nA: I leave all my Mac devices on all the time, has had no effect on battery life (where applicable), or performance.\n\nA: Yes - turn your unit off, as opposed to Sleep or Restart, at least once per week to enable the built in Apple optimization processes designed to run at shut down and startup to do their thing. Give your units a night off. And do not leave power plugged in 24/7 to the various Macbook units.\n", "Q: publickey error using cvs I'm trying to get a copy of the repository for scrotwm using their cvs repository, but I'm having some trouble. I'm running the pull according to this example: http://onethingwell.org/post/5609933530/scrotwm-osx.\nSadly, when I run the cvs pull I get the following error message: \nPermission denied (publickey).\ncvs [checkout aborted]: end of file from server (consult above messages if any) \n\nI haven't managed to get anything else working with cvs, but it looks like an ssh error of some kind. My github is working fine, and I know how to set up new ssh keys for github, but I haven't been able to find anything similar for cvs. Any ideas on places I should look?\n\nA: It may be because scrotwm has been renamed to spectrwm and I'm guessing the old CVS repository has been removed.\nAs per the above link, you can clone the new git repository using either of the following:\n    $ git clone git://opensource.conformal.com/spectrwm.git\n    $ git clone https://opensource.conformal.com/git/spectrwm.git\n\n", "Q: How to install Windows 8 with BootCamp 5 Assistant via USB? I was able to put Windows 8 setup files on my usb from the installer. Now I just upgraded my machine to Mountain Lion. I have gone through the BC Assistant and it only asks for my Windows CD to be put into my drive. There is no longer an option to install via other media. \nAnyone know of a workaround to install with USB stick?\n\nA: This doesn't exactly answer your question but may help solve your problem: create a bootable Windows DVD from the Windows 8 setup files, as explained  here.\nI did it myself some months ago when upgrading Windows XP to Windows 8, and it worked without a hitch.\nYou will need:\n\n\n*\n\n*Access to a Windows computer.\n\n*oscdimg.exe, a command-line tool for creating bootable Windows ISO files. This file is part of a larger download:\n\n\n*\n\n*For Windows XP SP2 with KB926044/2003 SP1 with KB926044/2003 SP2 you'll need the Automated Installation Kit at http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=10333\n\n*For Windows 8/7/2012/2008 R2/Vista/2008 you'll need the Assessment and Deployment Kit at http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30652\n\n\n*Windows 8 setup files.\nThe steps are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download and install oscdimg.exe.\n\n*Put the Windows 8 setup files in a folder. While any name will do I found C:\\WIN8AIO to be a popular choice, so I'll use it.\n\n*Open a command prompt as administrator and create the ISO image C:\\WIN8DVD.ISO like this:\n\\path\\to\\oscdimg.exe -lWIN8DVD -t10/26/2012:00:00 -m -u2 -bC:\\WIN8AIO\\boot\\etfsboot.com C:\\WIN8AIO C:\\WIN8DVD.ISO\n\nFor more information on oscdimg.exe and its command line options see this article at Microsoft.\n\n*Burn C:\\WIN8DVD.ISO and use it with Boot Camp Assistant on your Mac.\n\nA: This article entitled \"How To Easily Install Windows 7 & 8 onto An External USB Storage with PWBoot\" published on the 27th May 2013 by K.Chen for nextofwindows.com maybe helpful and provides step by step instructions (which should be followed very carefully).\nPWBoot (Portable Windows Boot) aims to simplify the process of making Windows Operating System to boot from any USB storage devices.\n", "Q: How to make non-editable non-savable PDF into editable and savable? My university provides forms such as here in non-editable and non-savable form (it also has some odd sign such as 'Print form' that I need to remove). I am able to print the document with Illustrator and edit it this way even without the 'Print form' but if I print it through browser, it has this odd sign 'Print form'. I don't want to rewrite things again-and-again. Is it possible to make the PDF so that people without Illustrator were able to edit and save it?\n\n\n*\n\n*Is there a way to make the PDF editable and savable in OS X?\n\n*Is the only way do it with Adobe Illustrator?\n\nA: Preview in Mountain Lion allows you to inform all the fields available in that form. If you need to actually remove fields, you can use Infix to convert it to a standard PDF.\nI just tried on the link you gave and it worked perfectly.\n", "Q: Pure Genius Or Pure Stupidity: Does An Old Mac G5 Make A Great BBQ? This question has some humor as well as practical implications for owners of Apple Mac G5s.\nI came across this earlier on today as an alternative recycling option:\n\nSource Macgasm\nIs this really a viable option (if a little extreme) & what other recycling methods exist for an old Apple Mac G5 ?\n\nA: Personally, I would lean against this for several reasons:\n\n\n*\n\n*The aluminum used in the Mac Pro cases isn't food grade metal.\n\n*Some of the adhesives in the case were potentially noxious.\n\n\nI realize it's tongue in cheek, but keep safe, people. :)\nEdit:\nThe frame of the Mac Pro(s) are basically aluminum. So you can take it to your local metal recycler and have it scraped for aluminum in exchange for money.\nYou can also refer to Apple's recycling policies.\nEbay/Craigslist are other options, as there are system rebuilders who would love to make use of an old Mac Pro case.\n", "Q: Sort order tiebreaker for \"Album by Artist\" If there are two tracks in an album made of various homemade MP3 files (rather than an imported CD or downloaded) that have the same \"album by artist\" value, what is the tiebreaker value that controls how iTunes orders those tracks?\nI even deleted the files, removed all the ID3 tags, renamed the files with a \"00 - \" prefix to try and force the order, but still they display in a random order in the Albums view. In the Songs view when sorting by name they are correct, but when sorting by \"Album by Artist\" they appear to be sorted randomly, and the order is consistent with that in the Albums view.\nCan anyone help? If I can just find the field that controls it I'll edit each track in iTunes to have \"01\" to \"14\" in that field to force it.\nMany thanks in advance.\n\nA: You need to set the Track Number tag for each file. That's the only way iTunes determines track order. If there is no track number, it defaults to either alphabetical, or to the order in which the tracks were added. (I've seen both, and don't understand why it chooses one or the other.)\n", "Q: Is it possible to find or wipe a lost iPod Touch if Find My iPod was not previously activated? I lost my 3rd-generation iPod Touch. How can I find or remove the personal info on it? The password feature was disabled at the time I lost it. Is there a way to activate Find My iPod or wipe out the data on it?\n\nA: In short, it is, unfortunately not possible to activate Find my iPod on a device that is no longer in your possession.\nIf Find My iPod was actually enabled, you can go to www.icloud.com and login to your Apple ID to see more information on the device and to set it so that the data is erased after being connected to the internet (if it wasn't already). If you log in to the iCloud web portal and the iPod isn't shown, then it was likely not enabled. In this situation, it would be impossible to activate it.\nRemember, either way, the iPod must be connected to the internet in order for any changes to be made.\n", "Q: Bluetooth Not Available - Mid 2010 Macbook Pro I have a 13\" mid 2010 Macbook Pro running 10.8.3. For some reason, I started it up the other day and my Bluetooth is now for some reason unavailable.\nI've had this problem in the past, and if my memory serves me correctly the only way to get it back was just to let it come back on it's own. However, it's very annoying that this happens apparently no reason and this is just not good enough.\nI've tried the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Restart, shut down, suspend/resume cycles\n\n*Reset SMC\n\n*Reset PRAM\n\n*Deleted any Bluetooth.plist files in ~/Library/Preferences\n\n*Verified permissions\n\n\nAnd nothing has worked. Any suggestions?\n\nA: I reviewed a similar problem with the same model on the MacRumors forum and the original poster responded that it was definitely a hardware issue. In researching parts to see if you could fix this yourself -- in case you are out of warranty -- I found that the Bluetooth hardware is part of the display assembly. This means you'll need to replace your display. The part itself is about $500 at iFixIt and the fix is consider \"difficult.\"\nThe only other suggestion I saw mentioned was to re-install OS X, but I would lean toward a hardware issue.\nGood luck!\n\nA: I have the same problem with my Mid2010 15\" right now. I purchased an Airport card on ebay for about $30. And my Mac is already out of warranty so I'll change the Airport card (where the Bluetooth chip is also located) on my own.\nI'll let you know how this turned out...\n\nA: if a hardware issue, get a bluetooth dongle for about $1.50 and plug into your usb.  Look on Amazon.  I know the bluetooth dongle isn't a techy fix, but it's fast and cheap.  Check out Amazon.  About two years ago I bought 5 for 72¢ each.\n\nA: Just checked.  Right now Amazon has:\nGeneric Mini Bluetooth USB 2.0 Dongle Adapter\nby Generic\n$1.09\n", "Q: Changing email addresses on my @me.com and @icloud.com When I was married I started both my @me.com and @icloud.com accounts.  The accounts are my first name and last (previously married) name run together.  Now that I am divorced I don't want that as my email.  I would rather have a different name at the front of my email.  How do I go about changing both accounts to another name and getting all my devices and itunes accounts moved over. \n\nA: Unfortunately, as was stated, you cannot change your @me.com or @icloud.com email addresses independently of your Apple ID. What I would recommend doing is setting up a Gmail (or other) address and using that as your primary Apple ID email (as well as all your normal email for that matter).\nIf you have a Mac you can even move all the email from your @icloud.com/@me.com account to your new Gmail account simply by setting up both and dragging the folders from one mail account to the other. \nAfter you set up a Gmail email address you can edit your Apple ID preferences at this site. That way, all you ever basically see is the new Gmail account.\n\nA: Unfortunately, depending on your situation, you may not be able to change your email address. You can check this Apple support page out for details.\nIf you sign up for an entirely new account, you'd lose the purchases you made under your existing one.\n\nA: Go into icloud mail and select preferences in settings on the left sidebar at the bottom. Select \"Accounts\" which will list your @me.com and @icloud.com aliases.  The @me.com cannot be changed, but you can create a new alias of the email address you would prefer.  This address will be an @icloud.com address.  \nThen go to \"composing\" tab.  Set default address to the new alias you created.  Then below that, deselect all the other email accounts and select the new alias.  \nThis doesn't get rid of the @me.com email, but when sending mail, it will at least use your preferred address sending and receiving.  Occaisionally the @me.com will pop up, but for the most part you can just forget about that address and use your new icloud alias.  \n\nA: I think the easiest thing to do here would be to change your Apple ID name, which is used to form your @me.com and @icloud.com email addresses.\nI haven't done this myself before, but Apple's HT5622 document includes the following, which seems to explain how this can be done:\n\nHowever... I don't completely understand this (eg exactly what they mean by \"Apple ID Name\").  So perhaps the best approach is to contact Apple Support and ask them.  Their page for Apple ID Support is here.\n", "Q: How to enter boot menu without command key? My Macbook air has a keyboard issue, the Z key does not work except upon startup where it becomes stuck for several seconds.\nThis interferes with opening the boot menu on startup, because it detects the combination of Command + Z instead of just Command, so I can never enter the boot menu.\nHow do I get into the boot menu with my faulty keyboard?\nEDIT: I have tried an external keyboard but the system still recognizes the faulty internal one.\n\nA: You could try installing rEFIt, which will give you a boot menu every time you boot up.\nhttp://refit.sourceforge.net\n\nA: I've checked Apple's knowledgebase and the web and cannot find a startup key sequence that uses the Z key.\n\n\n*\n\n*Startup key combinations for Intel-based Macs\n\n*OS X keyboard shortcuts\nAs for how to get your MacBook Air (MBA) to recognize an external keyboard on startup, you may need to connect an external monitor and the external keyboard (using USB, not Bluetooth). Then startup the MBA with the lid closed (either using a power button on the external keyboard, or push the power button on the MBA and close the lid).\nLike the other poster, I'm not sure what you mean by \"boot menu,\" but hopefully this will help.\n\nA: If it's an older MacBook Air with an infrared receiver you can try holding the \"Menu\" button on an Apple remote to access the Startup Manager.  The newer (Late-2010 and up) MacBook Airs don't have infrared capabilities though, so this is limited to the pre late-2010 MacBook Airs.\nI seem to recall that this trumps keyboard keys being held down but after a quick search I couldn't find documentation to confirm/deny that.\nAlternately you could set the desired startup disk in the System Preferences > Startup Disk preference pane, or use the bless command in terminal to designate a startup disk.\nThe only other option I can think of is removing the bottom case, disconnecting the top cases (keyboard is part of the top case) connection to the logic board and then using an external keyboard.\n", "Q: Can the Finder resume a file copy? I know about rsync and how to use it, but sometimes I just want to copy files using the Finder. However, if that fails, I have to do everything all over again, since the Finder does not seem to be able to resume a file copy action. Is there a way around this?\n\nA: No, the Finder does what it does and that is do its best not to leave anything unfinished.  If it can't finish a copy it deletes the partials.  \nYou could probably hack together a scriptlet that would let you drag and drop files onto it that would then rsync the file somewhere. You could even make it a folder action.  But it would be limited in where the files end up.  \n\nA: Finder now supports resume, since Monterey, after you cancel a copy. I'm not sure if it works when the copy is interrupted, eg by a connection drop.\nYou can find a guide here https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/pause-copying-file-resume-it-later-monterey/\nYou pretty much get a resume icon next to the greyed out icon of the item whose copy was incomplete.\n", "Q: How to specify group id for a user-defined group When I set up my accounts in Snow Leopard Server, I was able to give an explicit group id to my user-defined groups using the old Workgroup Manager.

You just have to download it and install it.\nYou can also do it using command line tools, but since you're used to Workgroup Manager, just use that.\nAdded May 2018:\nIn later versions of OS X, you can edit the group IDs directly from the System Preferences → Users & Groups control panel. Ctrl-click the group name and select \"Advanced Options...\" from the popup menu. That will display a form that lets you change the group ID (as well as the group name and the group UUID). Be careful though, as this just lets you change the mapping of number to name. Any resource associated with group ID 1025, for example, will still belong to group 1025, even if you change the group name associated with that ID. Which resources are associated with a group by ID, which by name, and which by UUID, I do not know.\n", "Q: What is the software different between Apple Lisa and first Macintosh? Lisa is released before Macintosh, but LOTS of books mention that the development of Macintosh involve a lot of effort and innovation. So, what are the Apple Lisa and Macintosh software major different? Also, is this the Lisa is the first Apple desktop using a mouse? Thanks. \n\nA: I'm pretty sure Apple had a mouse for the Apple II line although I'm not sure if it overlapped with the Lisa and Mac.\nThe first Lisa had its own operating system which used an early version of Bill Atkinson's quickdraw routines, had overlapping windows, pull down menus although if memory serves it had a document model more like OpenDoc than what the Mac had a bit later.\nAfter the Mac came out in 1984 the Lisa was rebranded \"Macintosh XL\" and it used an early version of the Macintosh OS until it was phased out.\nIn short, the Lisa was the bridge between the ideas that Jobs, Atkinson and others had seen at Xerox PARC and the Mac.\nHere's an excellent history: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_lisa\n", "Q: make applescript close keynote after presentation is over does anyone know how i would achieve the following?\ni want to make applescript close Keynote AFTER the slideshow is finished. any idea? mybe via the class \"playing\" in keynotes application properties? but i dont know hw to write it.\nmy code so far\ntell application \"Keynote\" to open \"/Users/bla/Desktop/bla1.key\"\ndelay 3 set var to properties of application \"Keynote\"\nrepeat if var contains \"playing:false\" then\nexit repeat\nend if\ndelay 1\nend repeat\n\ndo shell script \"killall 'Keynote'\" \n\nthx \n\nA: If you run this to kick off the keynote then it will quit Keynote as soon ( well within 5 seconds ) as you stop presenting (esc).

Outside of iOS updates? I realize that safari is updated when iOS is updated. But is it ever updated silently, like chrome or firefox, for more minor additions? Say for bugs in webkit/nitro.\nOr is it more like the stock android browser, or internet explorer? Which only are updated when the platforms they reside on are updated.\n\nA: Safari is only updated with iOS updates. As far as I know, there is no background updating, and updates only happen along with iOS updates.\n\nAbove is a screenshot from the new features of iOS 6 - listed is Safari as one of those updates.\n", "Q: iMac as video server for iPad How can I use an iPad to view video files that are stored on an iMac in the same local network?\nThe only idea I have so far, is to set up a HTTP server on the iMac, and browse the video files with Safari on the iPad.\nDoes OS X provide a more elegant way to do this?\n\nA: You can use iTunes Home Sharing. \nFor it to work, you need two thing:\n\n\n*\n\n*All your movies in mp4 for iTunes (Ideally with Metadata and Images, looks cleaner and is easier to search on the iPad)\n\n*An iTunes Store Account\n\n\nYou then put all the movies in iTunes, leave it open and activate \"Home Sharing\" in iTunes->Preferences->Sharing\n\nCheck \"Share my library on my local network\"\nThen, go on your iPad, make sure you are connected with the same iTunes ID and go in the standard Video app. You shall see you library that can be shared. Tap it, let it load and there you go, you have access to movies from your iPad! (it also include TV Series)\n\nA: Take a look at Plex.\nDepending on how you'd like to configure Plex on your iMac, you can not only serve your media on the LAN, but also securely over the WAN to your personal iOS devices - or to a web browser.\n\nA: In addition to the excellent suggestions of Plex and iTunes Home Sharing, have a look at Air Video. You run the app on your iOS device, and download the free server component to your Mac or PC. You point the server program at your files, and it handles all streaming and transcoding (so you can use formats iOS doesn't support).\n\nA: I've tried both Plex and Air Video and they're both decent. I'm now using StreamToMe because the (serving Mac) CPU utilization is significantly lower using StreamToMe's server component (ServeToMe) than the other two in my experience. I tested ServeToMe on an old white MacBook Core 2 Duo w/ 2 gigs of ram. Upon selecting the media (video in my case) file to view on iOS, the server component of all three of these softwares begins to encode the file in real time (as I understand it) to stream it to the iOS device. With StreamToMe the beat up old MacBook was still usable while it was encoding a video and with the others it had a lot more trouble keeping up.\nAll the Best\n", "Q: What's a good iPhone app for playing MP3 music?

I bring my MacBook Pro back and forth between home and work. I have a Magic Mouse in both places. I guess because they are both the same model, I have to re-pair the mouse with the computer every time I go back and forth. They have very similar names so I'd like to rename them something like \"Work mouse\" and \"House mouse\". So far I haven't found a way. Is it possible?\n\nA: In addition to other answers that indicate to use a secondary click on the device shown in the Bluetooth menu, also note that this is not possible while the device is connected with the cable.\nI obtained a new Magic Mouse and connected it using the cable to my computer running macOS 10.14.3. The device was recognized and a system dialog informed me that \"$PreviousOwner's mouse\" had been connected to my system over Bluetooth and was ready to use. Naturally I wished to rename it, but the contextual menu only contained the option \"Remove\". There was neither \"Rename\" nor \"Disconnect\".\nAfter having removed the cable and reopened the Bluetooth menu, the contextual menu showed the two options that were previously missing, and I was able to proceed with the rename without further problems.\nI later reconnected the cable and noted that the two options again disappeared.\n\nA: With the new update, you may not find the cog wheel, so instead you can go into bluetooth settings and right-click (click with two fingers) the device you wish to rename.\n\nIt should come up with a context menu.\n\nSelect Rename, which will open a window where you can rename your mouse to anything you like.\n\n\nA: You can do so in System Preferences. Open the Bluetooth panel, select your Magic Mouse and click the cog wheel at the bottom to select \"Rename\" from the context menu.\nThis option will only be available if the mouse is not plugged in.\n\n\nA: I was having the same issue and noticed that the context menu was different when rename would fail:\n\nI was able to get the full menu (with \"Disconnect\") and successfully rename the device by not using it while attempting to rename (I was using CTRL-Command to bring up the context menu).\n\nA: For macOS High Sierra 10.13.6 (17G65), to rename, go to System Preference → Bluetooth → Control + click to open rename option.(for other macs use a double click on the object you want to rename then click rename, for others, use this technique: click on the item click the log, then rename.\n", "Q: how to make an \"archive\" button for Mail.app in mac os x mountain lion to work with gmail accounts? has anyone tried to build an \"archive\" button for apple mail to move mails from the Inbox to All Mail in Mail.app (Mountain lion)? \nthere is this page: http://stl.techinno.nl/archive/\nbut it wont work with the mail version on mountain lion. \nThanks! \n\nA: You could assign a shortcut to a script like this:\ntell application \"Mail\" to tell account \"Gmail\"\n    messages of mailbox \"INBOX\" whose flagged status is false and read status is true\n    move result to mailbox \"[Gmail]/All Mail\"\nend tell\n\nThis would only move selected messages:\ntell application \"Mail\"\n    selected messages of message viewer 1\n    move result to mailbox \"[Gmail]/All Mail\" of account \"Gmail\"\nend tell\n\n", "Q: is it worth it to install SSD internally, instead of using USB3? I prefer to keep my boot drive external, so that I can quickly boot using another Mac if my primary Mac fails. I use a USB3 drive dock to connect the drive to my Macs.\nI bought a 120GB SSD w/SATA3 (6.0Gbps) interface, capable of pushing >500MB/sec read and 260MB/sec writes, sustained.\nUSB 3.0 is pretty fast -- spec'ed at 5.0Gbps. I'm thinking that performance over USB 3.0 should be at least in the same ballpark as SATA3 (6.0Gbps). It's about an hour of risky, careful work to install the SSD internally in my Mac Mini, is it worth it?\n\nA: YES, it's definitely worth it. With my setup, sustained transfer speeds were roughly 75% better using SATA, vs. USB3.\n\nI tested both configurations using ZoneBench as follows:\nSSD: 120GB OWC Mercury Electra 6G \nMac: Late 2012 Mac Mini, 2.6Ghz core i7, model ID Macmini6,2, 16GB RAM\nHot-Swap unit: StarTech USB3-to-SATA dock, model SATDOCK22U3S ver2\n  All speeds are in MB/sec (mega-bytes per second)\n\n  Configuration A: SSD connected via Hot-swap USB 3 Dock\n  Lowest / Avg / Highest R/W speeds:  95 / 150 / 185\n\n  Configuration B: SSD installed in internal HDD bay in 2012 Mini (direct SATA):\n  Lowest / Avg / Highest R/W speeds: 145 / 250/ 460\n\nAll tests were repeated 5 times at intervals of 1 hour, under normal system usage. (A few apps open & idle, CPU & system I/O load 99% idle.)\n\nAs one can see, in this configuration, taking the trouble to mount the SDD in the Mini's internal SATA bay is well worth the massive performance gains.\n\nA: It is worth it since you'll have your fast drive connected internally. Only in the case where  you're worried about being able to boot off another server quickly, backup/clone your Mini to that USB3 drive would I keep the SSD externally connected.\nThe decrease in reliability of SSD vs. HDD can be countered by an automated backup system. You are doing backups, right?\n", "Q: How do I enable key repeat on iOS? I am working on a project in iOS and would like to enable key repeat. I have done quite a bit of looking around and have failed to come up with any option like that (which surprises me quite a bit, actually).\nIs there a way to enable key repeat on an iOS device? \n\nA: The other answers here are inaccurate. The correct answer is \"sort of\"\n@MichaelGoerz Comment is correct. There seems to be a bug in iOS where key repeat only works for certain keys instead of all keys as expected. For example backspace will repeat per your settings but \"w\" won't. I recommend filing a bug report with Apple at https://bugreport.apple.com in an effort to prod them to fix this. This bug is highly irritating especially when using remote desktop tools where holding down a key might be required. \nI occurred to me that this may also be by design, an attempt by Apple to be \"helpful\" by only allowing the most commonly used repeating keys. Due to the fact that the Settings->General->Accessibility->Keyboard->Key Repeat menu makes no mention of this I am treating it as a bug.\n\nA: It seems like this is a bug right now and happens with Magic Keyboards as well as other Bluetooth keyboards (there is no keyboard discrimination).\nIt looks like the keys a-z, A-Z and 0-9 don't repeat. However, all other keys seem to work fine (including the symbols above the numbers on a conventional QWERTY keyboard).\nI have tested this on an iPad Air 3rd gen and iPad Air 5th gen with the Magic Keyboard and some other 3rd party Bluetooth keyboard.\nI contacted Apple support who got in touch with the engineering team responsible for this. They confirmed from them that it is a bug and they're aware of it. They said they would try their best to escalate it, otherwise cannot guarantee that it's fixed.\nApple is pretty opaque with this kind of thing and they were not willing to provide an issue to track online etc.\nAlthough the lack of transparency is not ideal I do think we should appreciate that they acknowledge this is a bug as opposed to shrugging it off as expected behavior. Bugs happen!\nI assume like any engineering team, this can be reprioritized if management decides this is more important. I would suggest contacting Apple to try to add to the pressure, or better yet, find someone you know that blogs about tech and have them do a little excerpt about the newest iPad and this odd behavior (maybe even compare it to any other tablet that doesn't have this bug).\nIf I find an improvement, I'll try to update this post. Hope this helps.\n\nA: Yes, iOS allows key repeat for Bluetooth keyboards, and you can even change the key repeat rate as follows (quoting LucaMarconato):\n\nIf you go in Settings->General->Accessibility->Keyboard->Key Repeat\n  you can set the Key Repeat Interval to 0,03 seconds (the minumum\n  allowed).\n\n\nA: No.*\n*At least not for the software keyboard. I believe that an external (USB or BlueTooth) keyboard will repeat such keys.\n\nA: Yes, sort of. I needed to repeat the * for separation of text. I was able to create a keyboard shortcut to place a line of stars by double tapping the * key. Worked for me, hope this helps.\n\nA: I concur with the others: by default, the iOS settings only allows auto-repeat for non-alphanumeric characters (everything, except letters and numbers). But you can make it work with alphanumeric characters using wantsPriorityOverSystemBehavior. What I did was:\nfor key in 0x061...0x079 { // all 26 lowercase roman letters\n    let K = Unicode.Scalar(key)!\n    let key = UIKeyCommand(input: \"\\(K)\", modifierFlags: [],  action: #selector(insertKey))\n    key.wantsPriorityOverSystemBehavior = true\n    basicKeyCommands.append(key)\n    let keyS = UIKeyCommand(input: \"\\(K)\", modifierFlags: .shift,  action: #selector(insertKey))\n    keyS.wantsPriorityOverSystemBehavior = true\n    basicKeyCommands.append(keyS)\n}\n\nThis gives me self-repeating keys for all lowercase and uppercase letters. If you want self-repeating keys for numbers, you need to be more careful: on many non-English keyboards, the numbers are not the default character for the key (you need to type shift to get the number, and you have characters & or ç without shift). So the previous approach won't work. I used a similar approach, but only for English keyboards:\nif let keyboardLanguage = self.textInputMode?.primaryLanguage {\n    if keyboardLanguage.hasPrefix(\"en\") {\n        for key in 0x030...0x039 { // all 10 numbers\n            let K = Unicode.Scalar(key)!\n            let key = UIKeyCommand(input: \"\\(K)\", modifierFlags: [],  action: #selector(insertKey))\n            key.wantsPriorityOverSystemBehavior = true\n            basicKeyCommands.append(key)\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nFinally, if your application users can switch to languages with multi-character input (Chinese, Japanese, Hindi-transliteration), you need to deactivate these keyboard shortcuts specifically for these:\nif let keyboardLanguage = self.textInputMode?.primaryLanguage {\n    if (!keyboardLanguage.hasPrefix(\"hi\") && !keyboardLanguage.hasPrefix(\"zh\") && !keyboardLanguage.hasPrefix(\"ja\")) {\n        // Insert here the first code snipet.\n    }\n}\n\nThis key.wantsPriorityOverSystemBehavior setting is available on iOS 15 and above.\n", "Q: Latest OS X 10.8.3 Memory Leak I have 8Gb memory installed.

If you show All Processes, you may be able to find the process(es) that are tying up memory.  You can click on a column to sort the results. My current machine has process 0, kernel_task, at 1.55 GB.  Firefox has 1.04 GB.  Surprised me.

My Airport Extreme broadcasts 5 GHz and 2.4 GHz channels separately.\n2.4 GHz operates on channel 4 and 5 GHz operates on channel 44. The network is WPA2 protected. 'Router Mode' is off. 'Radio Mode' is 802.11 a/n - 802.11 b/g/n (Automatic). And my 'Country' is selected to United States.\nAlso everything, including my network gear and things that connect to it, is up-to-date. And I'm not on any other DNS.\nRecently I made the Airport Express extend the 5 GHz channel instead of the 2.4 GHz one because of 5 GHz's better performance.\nBut now when I connect to my 5 GHz channel I get worse performance than my 2.4 GHz one.\nBelow are the screenshots of my tests on both of the channels. The faster one is the 2.4 GHz one. (by the way, I know it's a shame but unfortunately that's the situation in my country at the moment, hopefully there will be fiber soon)\n\n\nWhat exactly is causing this woeful performance on 5 GHz? What am I missing here?\n\nA: The 5GHz is all hype.  It can be faster, only if you're close to it.  2.4GHz is still superior in range and as you know, WiFi speed drops off the further away you get from your access point. \nThe only time I've found 5GHz useful is: When many other networks are interfering with mine. (in between two large apartment buildings with 12+ networks bouncing within the corridor, it's nice to switch off of the 2.4GHz)  \nOr, if I'm in the same room as the AP, I can get a strong signal.  Then 5GHz is sometimes faster.\nhere's something interesting from wirecutter.com\nNo matter what they are called or technology they use, repeaters start out with a minimum 50% throughput loss. The reason is that a repeater must receive, then retransmit each packet using the same radio on the same channel and with the same SSID. If the repeater is very efficient, then your loss will be close to 50%. But if it’s not, throughput loss can be higher.”\nThanks to that 50% loss in bandwidth right off the top, just about all wireless extenders suck.  \nhttp://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-wi-fi-extender/\n\nA: Before making any attempt to use any wireless channel,\nyou should first analyze your wireless environnment and\nits pollution level.\nFor this kind of analysis, I advise you to use\niStumbler which is a pretty good tool to analyze wireless\nenvironnment.\nOnce you have sorted all your neighbor networks along their signal\nstrength, you'll be able to choose a free channel. This may as well\nbe on channels from 802.11b than the ones coming from the 802.11a.\nIf you find equally free channels on 802.11a and 802.11b, here is\na trick to help you choose between channels of each sort.\nIf you are rather far (between 15m and 25m)\nfrom your AirPort Express I advise you to\nchoose the 802.11b. If you are rather near (below 15 m) of your AirPort\nExpress, you should choose the 802.11a.\n\nA: Try rolling back the AirPort Extreme firmware. When I updated to the latest (7.6.4 IIRC) on my Airport Extreme I had much worse wireless performance on both bands but 5ghz was deteriorated to the point that it ceased to work in the same locations that it worked fine pre-firmware update. You may have to install Airport Utility 5.6 which is the last version of the old airport utility. They can both exist on the same Mountain Lion Mac. I rolled back to 7.6.2 and 7.6.1 (7.6.3 is for the new Apple TV style airport express only AFAIK) and didn't get any relief until rolling back to 7.6\nAll the Best\n\nA: I have the same setup as you (5GHz Airport Extreme on top of 2.4GHz router - the wifi of this one can be on or off), except that something I did changes completely this scenario. The 2 base stations are close, so there is no reason I should not set the Airport as a repeater using an Ethernet cable and not as and extensor.\nThe problem, as everyone called out, is that the repeater is another point on your network and this time makes a lot of difference because it's another wifi transmission. \nSo, if you are going to extend the wifi range or want to go with 5GHz, from another router, make sure you do the hard work of wiring, because it will be only once, but you will benefit every time you use it and a lot. Remember, wifi is already kinda lossy transmission.\n", "Q: How to untangle Multiple iOS devices sharing one Apple ID for iMessage I pay all our Internet bills and iPhone bills (3)/ just so you know when I ask this q I am not trying to get use off someone else's account.\nWe have a Mac, a Mac mini and MacBook\nWhen I recvd my iphone, it synced with my husbands apple ID off his computer, now when I am asked for ID password I use his.

My friend has an iPhone 4s, it was bought from in the USA from Virgin Mobile. I want to do a factory unlock (unlock the SIM). I already know how to jailbreak, would jailbreaking work? Any help would be appreciated.\nI read this answer, but was told the following:\n\nVirgin Mobile USA iPhones are CDMA. If you need a refresher - CDMA\n  means the phone is locked to the network forever.\nYou will never be able to unlock your iPhone from Virgin Mobile USA.\n  They do not use sim cards - so there is no way to unlock it.\n\nIs that correct? My question is, is it possible to unlock CDMA iPhone 4S from Virgin Mobile?\n\nA: Of course, it's possible!  \nSimply buy a Gevey Turbo SIM ultra S CDMA.  Note: type \"geve\" into google and watch it autofill with \"gevey sim\".  Good news- You're in luck because the price is not bad for the CDMA Gevey SIM turbo at this time. \nsometimes, they're close to $100.  only $35 right now.\nalso, i've included some other links to help explain\nhttp://theiphonewiki.com/wiki/Gevey_SIM  (Personally been using iphonewiki for iOS firmware for years, totally legit.  NOTE: the reference to musclenerd possibly the most knowledgable mofo on baseband, unlock, JB etc.) \nhttp://www.applenberry.com/unlock-cdma-iphone-4s/ \n\nA: Unlocking a CDMA phone is a touchy thing. CDMA means no SIM card, so you are mainly stuck with another CDMA carrier, and most of the time, they won't be using the correct bands for you phone. \nIn short: not worth it, you won't be able to change to another carrier with it\nIf you are certain that your future carrier runs CDMA networks and uses bands that your particular phone support, then go for it. \n\nA: Here you go:\nhttps://community.virginmobile.com.au/t5/Phones-Forum/Unlocking-Iphone-4/td-p/8564\nWorked with my 4S as well.\n\nA: There is another question and answer thread that explains the issue in more detail, but for all intents and purposes if you purchased a CDMA iPhone from a carrier then you will be 100% out of luck; you simply cannot use another provider’s SIM card.\nThe only way you could ever expect to use a CDMA iPhone with another GSM network is to get a factory unlocked phone directly from Apple. But if you get any CDMA phone from a provider like Verizon, Sprint or Virgin Mobile you are basically locked into their CDMA network. No chance to just pop another carrier’s SIM card in there to get GSM service from someone else.\n", "Q: Airport express with double NAT is super slow We have a satellite modem which will hand out a single IP address via DHCP. We're unable to make changes to this modem.  We want to share the network connection to a PC with ethernet and wirelessly to an iPad.\nWe've put a new Airport Express in, with the modem connected to the WAN port and the PC connected to the ethernet port. As the modem will only hand out a single IP, we've setup the Airport to share this address (NAT) and to hand out addresses (DHCP).  \nNaturally, we're getting the double-nat warning, which is expected.  The setup works in that, the PC and the iPad both get address via DHCP from the AirPort and can surf the web. \nHowever, when the modem is connected directly to the PC, download / upload is 5Mbps / 1Mbps.  Via the Airport it's 50Kbps / 220Kbps.\nWe've tested both ethernet cables between the modem and the PC and they don't appear to be the cause. \nAny ideas on why the AAE is so slow when setup in this configuration? \n\nA: I've had better luck with configuring AAEs when using the older airport utility 5.6 via Macbook - if you're using the iPad to manage setup, it's likely that you're on a newer version of AirPort Utility.   The newer versions are simplified and probably best for the most.  However, it's actually more difficult when stepping outside the  default config settings.  \ntl;dr if there's anyway you can manage your AAE via Macbook, then try installing a previous version of the aiport setup utility  & things will make more sense.

The only limitation being that you'll be restricted to listening to them in the same (file manager) app and not with the Apple's Music app. \n\nA: If you wish to listed to your MP3s in the Apple's built in Music app for iOS, syncing via iTunes on desktop is your only resort.\nIf you subscribe to the paid Apple Music service, you can turn on iCloud Music Library and get your MP3s in your iPhone without syncing it with iTunes on desktop. (However, from your MP3 collection, only the songs matching with the ones available in iTunes Store will be made available).\nFor more information, you can refer this Apple support document, Turn on iCloud Music Library.\n", "Q: iOS Developer Account With VISA Debit Card Can anyone confirm whether Apple accepts VISA debit card to buy iOS Developer account that costs $99.\nI can use the same card to purchase apps from the App Store but is this card can also be used to buy iOS developer account?\n\nA: According to Apple iOS Developer website, only valid credit cards are accepted. Googling suggest attempted purchase using debit card didn't work, unfortunately.\nIt’s up to your bank to code whether the card is valid for Apple to charge in the region it decides to charge you for this product. Globally, many (if not most) debit cards will work for any Apple transaction, but some will not if your bank establishes a limit for transactions in the regional online store Apple uses for your transaction or otherwise restricts your card to local or country-specific ATM only. There are debit cards with very strict terms that will not work with Apple.\n\nA: I've used debit cards for years. But I'm in Europe, where debit cards are standard; it's possible that things are different in the US.\n\nA: I have just used VISA Debit card which works for me :)\nForm says credit card details and however debit card works. \n\n\nA: Yes it works. I have VISA Debit card issues by ICICI Bank in India. I bought the Apple Developer Program enrolment with that card and it was successful. I do not know about other banks. But in India and with ICICI it certainly works.\n\nA: Debit cards with \"Verified by Visa\" or \"3D SecureCode\" will failed on international transactions. \nPlease use any debit cards without these verification steps in order to bypass the USSD command to send you the verification code to your phone. \n", "Q: Choose display when doing a screen capture with external display I have a Macbook with an external display. I use both displays and when I do a screen capture (⌘ + ⇧ + 3) I get two files on the desktop, one for each display. Is there a way to choose which display to grab the screenshot from when doing the screen capture?\n\nA: You might use ⇧⌘4 (Save picture of selected area as a file) and just drag the selection around one display.\nscreencapture -m only captures the main display:\n-m      Only capture the main monitor, undefined if -i is set.\n\nI don't know if -S supposed to capture the display of the selected window, but options like -Sw or -SW only seemed to capture the selected window.\n-S      In window capture mode, capture the screen instead of the window.\n-w      Only allow window selection mode.\n-W      Start interaction in window selection mode.\n\n-R (rect) captures a specified area:\nscreencapture -R0,0,1920,1080 /tmp/screencapture.png\n\n\nA: Thanks to Lauri Ranta's answer, I made a Keyboard Maestro shortcut. I thought I'd share it so that other people can re-use it.\n\n\nA: I am using macOS Catalina 10.15.7 in April 2022.\nThe option of \"⇧ ⌘ 5\" gives an option to select \"Screenshot and recording options\". The default is \"Capture Entire screen\". This can be changed dynamically to \"Capture Selected Window\". If \"Capture Selected Window\" is selected, then a camera icon replaces the pointer, and I can select which screen to take a screen shot of, by pointing the camera icon at the external monitor, for example.\nI also map the keyboard shortcuts for screen capture so that instead of \"⇧ ⌘ 5\", I can just press the \"F5\" key.\n", "Q: Symlink TO dropbox folder in different user account Recently purchased a new Mac to be used as a family Mac. We share my Dropbox account and I have installed this into my user folder. \nQuestion: Can I create a symlink into my wife's documents folder TO the Dropbox folder in my account?\n\nA: If your wife's account has read/write access to your Dropbox folder, then a symlink should work. You might need to give special permission to your Dropbox folder to your wife's account, and apply those permissions to enclosed items…\n                                               \n", "Q: Install a new color profile on Mac OS 10.8 I have a IIYama screen that curerntly display garbages (very, very poor quality). \nOn the IIYama website, I found drivers for my screen (ProLite B2409HDS), it contains the following files:\n\n\n*\n\n*2409hds.cat\n\n*2409HDS.icm\n\n*2409HDS.inf\n\n\nAnd some other files for Windows 7.\nBut my issue is, on my Display preferences, I can't see any button to add a new profile using my icm file :\n\nIf I click on Open profile, I get a ColorSync profile that looks like when I open the given 2409HDS.icm file manually, so I think there is a way to add it... But can't find it!\nAny suggestion ?\n\nA: I finally found how to add profile: put the icm file on that directory:\nMacintosh HD\\Library\\ColorSync\\Profiles\n\nAnd you'll see your profile here....\nAnyway, this did not solved my issue, it looks like Apple really want us to buy their incredibly expensive screens. I surely regrets paying 30 boxes to upgrade to 10.8.\n", "Q: How does the Airport Access Control work? I would like to set some rule on my Time Capsule and Airport Express in such a way that some cell phones can connect only in specific time slots.\nIn my network both the devices are connected to a router, which provides the Internet connection. Time Capsule and Airport Express create two networks with the same name and password (i.e. one is not an extension of the other).\nI tried to set up some rules in this way:\n\n\n*\n\n*Phone MAC address\n\n*Time slot 1: from 12AM to 1 PM\n\n*Time slot 2: from 2PM to 11:59PM\n\n\nHowever the phone is still able to connect form 1 to 2 pm.\nI also tried to modify the default rule in order to set up the time constraints for all the clients and then I added a rule for allowing the connection to my laptop all without constraints (all the day, all hours). With this second option I wasn't able to connect my laptop to Internet. \nHow can I configure a filter for not allowing the phones to connect from 1pm to 2pm?\nAlso:\n\n\n*\n\n*What's the time my airport bases are using? It is retrieved from the net and is it based on my default time zone?\n\n*When I insert a rule and specify a time slot. Is the time slot the period in which the connection is allowed or the period in which it is not allowed?\n\n*Which is the priority assigned to the rules in case of constraints?\n\n*And finally, do I have to set up the same rules on both the stations right?\n\n\nA: First of all, I would suggest setting this up with the Time Capsule first (unplug the AirPort Express). Then, once you have it working on the Time Capsule, you can duplicate it with the AirPort Express.\nOption 1\nIf you want to lock things down as much as possible, then \"No Access\" should be the default:\n\nAnd then create a new entry for the cell phone for when you do want to allow access:\n\nHowever, that will mean that you have to create entries for all of your other devices as well.\nOption 2\nSo your alternative is to make the default \"Everyone is welcome\":\n\nBut then specify when the cell phone is allowed to access:\n\nWhich to try?\nI would use Option 1 unless you have so many other devices connecting that it would be impractical. \nOption 2 seems like it would be easier to setup, but I have to admit I have not tried it myself.\nTime Zone\nTime Zone information is set here:\n\nNote that I am still using AirPort Utility 5.6.1 because I find it a lot easier to use than AirPort Utility 6.\nYou can use 5.6.1 on Mountain Lion, despite what the installer will tell you.\nSee http://www.tuaw.com/2013/01/22/use-automator-to-get-the-airport-utility-5-6-1-working-on-os-x-1/ and http://www.macworld.com/article/1167965/mountain_lion_and_the_ancient_airport_base_station.html for details on how to install it.\n", "Q: How to prevent sending of hostname via DHCP? I am trying to prevent OS X from sending its hostname to the DHCP server. For example, in OpenSuse systems there is DHCLIENT_HOSTNAME_OPTION=\"AUTO\".\nI cannot find a similar option in OS X for this, does somebody know more?\n\nA: I was trying to answer the opposite question: why does my Mac NOT send a hostname in DHCP requests. \nAfter discovering that some Macs send hostnames and others do not, I found the cause in my case: spaces in the Computer Name.\nFor the gory details, see my Server Fault posting. if you don't want your computer to send a hostname, you could put a space or another unusual character in the Computer Name, and that should do it.\n", "Q: Outlook for Mac 2011: How to find the folder where a message is stored? When I perform a search in Outlook for Mac 2011, I can't seem to figure out how to determine which folder each of the search results is stored.\nThis questions has been answered for Office for Windows: http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook-help/i-can-t-find-the-folder-where-a-message-is-stored-HA001140027.aspx\nThis is probably completely obvious, but I can't seem to find it...\nUpdate: I'm still looking for a solution that doesn't require me to switch to View -> Reading Pane -> Below\n\nA: The easiest method to show which folder an email is currently located is to right click on the header bar in Outlook and add the \"folder\" (visible columns have a check mark to the left of it) column to the current view. This will show you which folder said email is contained in when you perform a search. If you no longer wish to have the \"folder\" seen in the current view just reverse the process to hide it again. If this is your only customization to the current view you can alternately choose to \"reset to defaults\" by right clicking on the header bar and choosing the reset to defaults action.\n\n\n\nA: Based on other answers, I found what seems to be (IMHO) the easiest approach: perform a search and \nselect \"All Items\"\nin the main ribbon (menu bar). You should see a column labeled \"Folder\" with the location of the item. I've, personally, been searching for a better answer for some time but thanks to this post, I came up with the aforementioned solution... with one click (with Reading Pane > Right).\n\nNote: If for some reason, the Folder column is NOT displayed in \"All Items\" view, you can right-click on the column headers and select \"Folder\".\n\nA: I simply double-click on the the message to open it in a new window. In the window bar or header, the folder name will follow the subject name of the message with a hyphen. In the example below, the subject is \"Attached Image;\" the folder is \"Scanner Email.\"\n \nI will add that I recently lost a folder somewhere within all my other folders. I knew the name of the folder by doing the above after doing a search for something in that folder. But I had no idea where it went and didn't want to expand every folder to find it. So I put my cursor in the search bar, which opens up the Search tab, then clicked on Advanced> clicked on the drop down menu where \"Item Contains\" shows> clicked on \"Folder\"> since I knew the name of the folder, as I mentioned, I could select: \"Folder\" \"Is\" and when I click on the button \"none\", it opens a drop down menu where I can scroll down and select \"Choose Folder.\" Once I started typing in the name of the folder, it brought it up with the full path. Hope this helps someone in the future. \n\n\n\n\n\nA: You can arrange the messages by Folder. This way you see the Folder also with Reading Pane > Right. To arrange the messages: View / Arrange by / Folder. Or click on Arrange by: (top of the messages list) / Folder.\n\nA: Search ALL FOLDERS will show you the folder, even in reading pane Right!\n", "Q: apple tv ssh script automation I have a Apple TV 2nd generation that is jailbroken and I run xbmc on it. At times it gets hung or freezes up. At that point, I open up the terminal on my macbook and run this script.\nssh root@apple-tv.local\nit asks me the password. I type in alpine\nthen I run \"killall AppleTV\"\nIs there any way to make this a one click operation, like a desktop icon that achieves the same result? Maybe an Apple Script or a Automator workflow?\nAny ideas please?\n\nA: you could ssh root@apple-tv.local killall AppleTV, also you might want to change your passwd from the default. As for a icon, you could but the above into a file and name it with a .sh extention, which could then be 'clicked on'.\nIf you don't want to be prompted for a ssh passwd, set up some ssh keys.\nSetting up ssh keys\nIf you already have a key on your computer, skip to step 2\n\n*\n\n*ssh-keygen -t rsa and follow the the prompts.

Can anyone recommend any OS X terminal emulators that don't have this feature?\n\nA: Old question here ... but thought I'd add that this has been supported in iTerm for almost two years now https://gitlab.com/gnachman/iterm2/issues/2900\nJust uncheck the \"Adjust window when changing font size\" box in the preferences.\n\n2020 Update\nThe box is now here:\n\n\nA: As far as I know, you can't do this in Terminal (I don't use iTerm, so I can't speak to that). The reason is that Terminal's window sizes are defined by characters, rather than pixels. Hence, when you change fonts, the window resizes based on the proportions of that font, so as to preserve the format of the existing content on the screen.\nIt sounds a bit silly at first, but given that a terminal simply displays only text characters, it makes sense — if a window is sized by pixels, you'd often end up with wasted space when the size of the window doesn't exactly match a character boundary.\n\nA: Based on your update to the question, have a look at the ZOC Terminal.  It it is commercial, can be used for local shells and also SSH and other connections, but offers tabbed sessions and the ability to control what happens when the window is resized (for example the there is a choice to retain the the rows/columns and instead shrink/grow font size, etc.).  Have a look at it's Session-Profile>Layout settings page.\n\nA: I have had this same issue for years. I recently found not a solution but a workaround for OS X, which does not require you to change terminal emulators. It uses an application called Spectacle: https://www.spectacleapp.com/\nSpectacle provides keyboard shortcuts for positioning and resizing windows (but not the fontsize, as far as I can tell). When I want to change the size of my font, I issue the default command to do so, which creates the unwanted re-sizing of the window. I then reduce or increase the size of the window using the Spectacle keyboard shortcut, until I get it back to a preferred size.\n", "Q: Running out of hard drive space, yet Disk Inventory shows only 190GB used vs. 480 GB used in HD Get Info? How is that possible? I'm down to 20GB on a 500GB hard drive and would like to know what's eating up the disk space, so I can clear out any large things I no longer need.\n2 screen shots are showing me Disk Inventory results and my Storage report in \"About This MAC\" \n\n\nThe MAC HD is showing 347GB \"OTHER\" space being used, whereas DISK INVENTORY is showing only 190GB Total used.  What am I missing or don't understand about what Disk Inventory is doing/showing, and how can I find significant files eating up the 347GB that isn't videos, photos?\n\nA: Time Machine local backups\nIf you use Time Machine, my guess is that the discrepancy is from local backups. If so, you can free up that space by connecting your Time Machine drive and running letting Time Machine complete a backup.\nOnce you have done that, you might want to disable local backups by issuing this command in Terminal.app:\nsudo tmutil disablelocal\n\nbut keep in mind that the local backups are meant to provide a safety net for those times when your Time Machine drive is not attached.\nIf the cause is not Time Machine, try OmniDiskSweeper\nIf that is not it, I recommend using OmniDiskSweeper to check your drive space.\nODS is a free app, and works very simply. When you launch ODS, it will show you a \"Drive List\" showing all of the available drives. Choose your main hard drive and then it will start searching. \nThe results are shown in a very simple column format, similar to the Finder. The largest folders will bubble to the top, and will let you see exactly where your disk space has gone.\nUsing OmniDiskSweeper as root\nODS will only calculate the sizes of the folders that you can read. 99% of the time, that should show you the problem.\nHowever, if you want to be sure that you are seeing everything you can launch the app as root using this command:\nsudo /Applications/OmniDiskSweeper.app/Contents/MacOS/OmniDiskSweeper\n\nBUT BE VERY VERY CAREFUL WHEN DOING THIS, since ODS will allow you to delete files.\n", "Q: Siri says \"speak you like to\"; is there something messed up with my phone? Whenever I ask Siri to call a business, she will go through each result and say \"Speak you like to call it, get directions...\". Is there something wrong with my phone? \"Speak you like to\" is definitely not idiomatic english (at least not in the US), so it's hard to believe something like this would slip by Apple QA. Am I missing something?\nEDIT:\nI've found exactly how to reproduce it. I'm using Best Buy as an example, but I would imagine any business will do.\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect a bluetooth device (I use my car, but a headset may work)\n\n*With the phone locked, activate Siri and say \"Call Best Buy\"\n\n\nShe'll say something like \"I've found two places named Best Buy fairly close to you. The first is X miles away. Speak you like to...\".\n\nA: No, there's nothing wrong with your phone.\nYes, Apple messed up. \nEver wonder why you have to have an Internet connection to use Siri? All the voice-to-text transcribing is done on Apple's servers - and those servers tell your phone exactly what to display and what to say. \nSo, you should probably tell Apple about it - post something on their support forums, file a Radar, something. Most likely, it can be fixed server-side.\n", "Q: Can I have color ls output automatically if my TERM is \"xterm-256color\"? Can I have automatic color output for ls if my TERM environment variable is set to xterm-256color?\n\nA: If you are using bash, you could add export CLICOLOR=\"YES\" to your ~/.bashrc.\n\nA: Just for the sake of anyone who might come along and wonder how to restrict this to only when the TERM is a certain value, you could put something like this in your shell's \"rc\" file (.zshrc or .bashrc etc):\ncase \"$TERM\" in \n\n    xterm-256color)\n        export CLICOLOR=\"YES\"\n    ;;\n\n    *color|xterm*)\n        export CLICOLOR=\"YES\"\n    ;;\n\n    vt100)\n        export CLICOLOR=\"NO\"\n    ;;\n\nesac\n\nNote that the 2nd example is just there to show why you might want to use 'case' instead of 'if/then': the ability to use wildcard matching and use multiple entries separated by |\n", "Q: Excel 14.1.0 (110310) on OSX 10.7.5 doesn't have Full Screen function I have OSX 10.7.5 on 2009 MacBook with Excel 14.1.0 but I don't have Full Screen function.

The screen and keyboard light up but are unresponsive. The only way out is a long-press of the power key.\nAny ideas how to diagnose or solve this?\nUPDATE 1 (per Bravado's question): There aren't any useful logs in /Library/Logs or ~/Library/Logs, but the syslog (via Console.app) contains a single interesting line amidst everything else which looks normal:\nkernel[0]: DarkWake thermal limits breached. Going to sleep!\n\nUPDATE 2: I remembered that a long time ago I had run sudo pmset -a hibernatemode 0 in an attempt to disable deep sleep which results in lengthy resumes. I've set it back to the default using sudo pmset -a hibernatemode 3... let's see if that helps...\n\nA: Did you look in ~/Library/Logs/CrashReporter/  if there are new entries that date from the crash?  Or look at the syslog (Utilities, Log-Viewer) if anything shows there prior to the hang? \n\nA: As described in my update, I ran sudo pmset -a hibernatemode 3 to reset the sleep mode and I've had only two of those crashes in the last six months.\nFWIW, running two Thunderbolt displays on a lid-closed MacBook is hell. Now that I only use one Thunderbolt display, things are generally much more reliable.\n", "Q: Is there an application that can see hand gestures to turn on the screen and scroll? While I am cooking with dirty and wet hands, I want to see the recipe on my smartphone without dirtying it.\nHow may I turn on the display and scroll without touching the phone?\nIs there an application that can see hand gestures to turn on the screen and scroll?\n\nA: There may not be an 'app for that' but you can do what I see in many Chinese take-out places - put some cling plastic wrap over the screen like they do with the keys of the cash-registers. OtterBox also makes cases with screen protectors. Cling wrap is far less expensive, though.\n", "Q: Applescript to get Dropbox file direct/share link Is it possible to retrieve the direct/share link of a file that is in my Dropbox folder, but not in its Public subfolder?\nI'd like to use that for an Alfred workflow. I saw many tutorials on how to do that for files that are in the Public folder but I'd like to use the new way Dropbox handles files sharing.\nThanks!\n\nA: To generate a shared link from a private folder you must make a request to Dropbox's servers using authentication with the Dropbox API. See the docs here.\nI am not sure you can do that from an applescript, maybe you can use curl. But if you want this in an Alfred workflow you can always use another scripting language like php or python, which are more suitable.  \n", "Q: My MacBook Pro Restarts Itself I've turned on my MBP this morning and twice it's just shut itself down and restarted.

in backtrace:\n     com.apple.NVDAResman (8.1)  \n      ^^^^^^^^ this is the driver which crashed\n\nIt is a crash in the video driver.  There may be various reasons for this, one could be hardware beginning to fail (overheating maybe also).\nThere seems to be a known problem with 2010 Apples and the video boards.  There is a thread in the apple support community about it and the guy who started it got his board replaced under warranty.\n\nA: first I would check the RAM\n\nIf you have 2 sticks of RAM, take out 1 stick and see if the situation improves using just the 1 stick. \nIf you still have issue, it could be that stick you just\n  tried to boot with, so swap it and try the other stick of RAM you removed\n  first. \nIf testing both sticks of RAM 1 at a time doesn't change your\n  situation, then its safe to assume RAM is probably not the issue\n\nI would then try to startup in safe mode and see if you still get the crash\n\nTo start up into Safe Mode (to Safe Boot), do this:\n1 Shut down your Mac and wait 10 seconds. \n2 Press the power button\n3 Immediately after you hear the startup tone, hold down the Shift key.\n4 You should press the Shift key as soon as possible after you hear\n  the startup tone, but not before. \n5 Release the Shift key when you see the gray Apple logo and progress indicator (spinning gear).\n\nIf still no luck, then it is likely another hardware issue such as graphics card (mentioned by @Bravado) and would need to take to apple\n", "Q: Mountain Lion ssh -X problems How to run on Mountain Lion X11 forwarding via SSH?\nExample:\nssh -X some@example.com xterm\n\nmy /etc/sshd_config has\nX11Forwarding yes\n#X11DisplayOffset 10\nX11UseLocalhost yes\n\n# XAuthLocation added by XQuartz (http://xquartz.macosforge.org)\nXAuthLocation /opt/X11/bin/xauth\n\nRestarted sshd with\nlaunchctl stop com.openssh.sshd\nlaunchctl start com.openssh.sshd\n\n(and from the Preferences -> Sharing too)\nStarted XQuatrz, and from the xterm I run\nssh -v -X mrp@192.168.1.17 xterm        #this part not works :)\n\ngot the next:\ndebug1: Authentication succeeded (keyboard-interactive).\nAuthenticated to 192.168.1.17 ([192.168.1.17]:22).\ndebug1: channel 0: new [client-session]\ndebug1: Requesting no-more-sessions@openssh.com\ndebug1: Entering interactive session.\ndebug1: Requesting X11 forwarding with authentication spoofing.\ndebug1: Sending command: xterm\ndebug1: Remote: No xauth program; cannot forward with spoofing.\nX11 forwarding request failed on channel 0\nxterm: Xt error: Can't open display: \nxterm: DISPLAY is not set\ndebug1: client_input_channel_req: channel 0 rtype exit-status reply 0\ndebug1: client_input_channel_req: channel 0 rtype eow@openssh.com reply 0\ndebug1: channel 0: free: client-session, nchannels 1\nTransferred: sent 2656, received 2480 bytes, in 0.1 seconds\nBytes per second: sent 29582.4, received 27622.1\ndebug1: Exit status 1\n\nfrom the xterm\n$ echo $DISPLAY\n/tmp/launch-BHtJfJ/org.macosforge.xquartz:0\n\nchanging it to :0 doesn't helps\nrunning from the xterm\n$ xauth list\njonatan.local/unix:0  MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1  f4f85682af36ae7d95cd3d244cb6beb2\n192.168.1.9:0  MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1  f4f85682af36ae7d95cd3d244cb6beb2\njonatan.local:0  MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1  f4f85682af36ae7d95cd3d244cb6beb2\n\nAny idea?\n\nA: You need to open XQuartz, go to X11 → Preferences → Security, there are two check boxes: disable the first, enable the second. Restart XQuartz and try again. You will also need to define the $DISPLAY variable like this:\nexport DISPLAY=clienthost:0.0\n\n\nA: Not sure how this could happen, but from the SSH source where the error message comes:\n/* Try to open a socket for the local X server. */\ndisplay = getenv(\"DISPLAY\");\nif (!display) {\n    error(\"DISPLAY not set.\");\n    return -1;\n}\n\nIt indicates that indeed ssh thinks the variable is not set at all (i.e. not malformed or something, but missing).  \nI'm not sure if SSH does change the user context so it gets a different environment.  You can try \nssh -vvv ....\n\n(multiple \"v\") to get more debug output, maybe this gives a hint somewhere in startup.\n", "Q: Mac external drive, file rights I have a mac that just received an external drive which I formatted and plugged in.\nWhen I am logged in as a normal user it all looks fine.\nBut when I am logged in as root the system recognizes ownership of the drive as '_unknown'.\nAlso, I can't change the ownership of any files/folders within the drive to root.\nI do 'sudo chown root somefolder' but nothing happens.\nWhy is this happening? How can I make the mac recognize the external drive correctly?\nFurther info:\nVersion: OSX 10.7.5.\nExternal drive is connected via USB.\nIt's a 3TB externa Lacie drive.\nI formatted the external drive by just clicking the 'Lacie setup' program that appears when you connect it.\nFilesystem: when i typed mount i recieved (hfs,local,nodex.noswich.journaled). \n\nA: In the Finder, get info on the volume (under the File menu). First, check the General section of the info window to make sure it's in one of the Mac OS Extended formats (probably \"Mac OS X Extended (Journaled)\"); if not, you'll need to reformat it. I'm not familiar with the Lacie setup program, but you can use Disk Utility to do this.\nIf it's in Mac OS X Extended format (or a variant), expand the Sharing & Permissions section of the info window, and see if it has an \"Ignore ownership and permissions\" option at the very bottom. If it's there and enabled, click the padlock and authenticate as an administrator, then disable the \"Ignore...\" option.\nExplanation: when OS X sees a new external volume, it assumes it's either come from another computer, going to another computer, or both.  Since there's no general correspondence between accounts on different computers, OS X figures there's no point in trying to track file ownership and simply disables it. If you enable ownership in the Info window, OS X will start storing & respecting ownership on files on that volume.\n\nA: Permissions are annoyingly complicated, often because of Access Control Lists.\nPathFinder from CocoaTech provides more extensive info on permissions than Finder, and has a trial period, but basically Terminal is required to get complete information.\nThere are actually three levels of obstruction to complete file control in OS X:  permissions, access control lists and flags.  The \"ls\" binary program (\"list directory contents [Unix equivalent to Windows \"dir\"]) requires command line flags to show all restrictions.  After starting Terminal, type:\ncd /Volumes\n/bin/ls -AFleO\n\nThis shows the current permissions, flags and Access Control List entries for each volume attached to the OS.  On my system, this produces:\ndrwxr-xr-x  30 root    wheel  - 1088 May  6 23:17 AltBoot/\ndrwxrwxrwx  46 root    wheel  - 1632 May 16 11:43 BackGround1/\ndrwxrwxrwx+ 37 root    admin  - 1326 May 24 14:07 BackGround2/\n 0: EBC292CE-0E64-4416-A676-288A96E46764 allow list,add_file,search,delete,add_subdirectory,delete_child,readattr,writeattr,readextattr,writeextattr,readsecurity,writesecurity,chown,file_inherit,directory_inherit\nlrwxr-xr-x   1 root    admin  -    1 May 14 20:40 Ground@ -> /\ndrwxrwxrwx+ 13 xxxxxx  staff  -  510 Feb 22 17:46 GroundTM/\n 0: EBC292CE-0E64-4416-A676-288A96E46764 allow list,add_file,search,add_subdirectory,delete_child,readattr,writeattr,readextattr,writeextattr,readsecurity\ndrwxrwxrwx  11 xxxxxx  staff  -  442 Feb 22 17:46 VMware4/\n\nThat long list of characters after \"BackGround2/\" is an ACL entry.  The dashes on the file line are where any flags would be listed.  The system flag can be set in multiuser mode, but can ONLY be unset in single user mode.  My father managed to get that flag set on some of his pictures, and it took me a long time to find out why I couldn't delete or change the owner on those files.  And he would never touch Terminal in any way.  \nUse the manual page command man chflags to get more info on how to set and unset the flags.  If all you see is dashes, then no flags are set.  \nTo remove the ACL entries, the command for my example would be \"sudo /bin/chmod -NR Background2/\", which would ask for an administrator password.  CAUTION !  Bad things can happen when you are the super user.  See man chmod for more info on ACL entries.  (I am putting /bin/ before the commands because only the Apple supplied programs in the /bin directory can affect ACLs.  There are GNU programs which can be added to OS X and have the same names, but cannot present or modify ACL entries.  These are available from MacPorts MacPorts.org.\n", "Q: Keyboard layout not usable in all programs I have used Ukelele to create a keyboard layout file (foo.keylayout) that lives in ~/Library/Keyboard Layouts. I used a US english layout as a base and have added some keymappings that let me type æøå (Norwegian characters) by pressing the left alt/option key and the ', ; and [ keys, plus some other symbols I use often – all using the left alt/option key.\nThis works great in most programs, like this text area in Chrome, in Finder, Macvim, Terminal… almost everywhere.\nBut, in Evernote and Sparrow, these mappings do not work, and if I show the current layout in the menu, I see that it switches back to the US layout when I bring one of these programs to the front. It is not possible to switch to my own layout in the dropdown menu – it switches back to US again immediately.\nIs it possible to fix this – or is this because of the technologies used by Evernote and Sparrow?\n\nA: Things you could try:\n\n\n*\n\n*Move the keyboard layout to /Library/Keyboard Layouts/. Keyboard layouts in the user library can't be selected in password dialogs or the login window.\n\n*Change the ID from Keyboard > Set Keyboard ID... in Ukelele.\n\n*Save the keyboard layout as a bundle instead of an XML file.\n\n\nTo apply changes to a keylayout file, you can for example run sudo touch /Library/Keyboard\\ Layouts/ and log out and back in.\n", "Q: My SD card slot doesn't work My SD card slot on the latest MacBook (Mid 2012) won't mount my SD card. The SD card doesn't appear in Finder, Disk Utility, Image Capture or anywhere. I know it's not a software problem, because nothing changed before and after. How do I fix it?\n\nA: I blew hard in the SD card hub. Now it is working fine.\n\nA: My Mac book stop seeing the cards, I used  a can of air to clean out the reader and it works fine now.\n\nA: This thread says that there's a switch in the SD card slot that detects when a card is inserted, and it can get clogged by dust or jammed or something. If you play around with a toothpick (or anything that fits in that hole), it'll fix your problem. Toggling that switch helps.\n\nA: for me sticking the SD card in and pulling it a bit out again ( just a few mm ) seems to get it mounted. \nThere's even a video that explains how to put it in and pull it out a bit here \nBut I find that putting it in under an angle works better:\nSticking the card in under a angle with the cut off corner against the top of the SD slot and then pushing the card in seems to get it mounted every time.\n\nA: Maybe some dust is stuck in the card slot. To remove, gently blow into the slot and try to insert the card again.\n", "Q: How can I change the default save location of Office for Mac?

I am thinking about installing the free Avast anti-virus software on my MacBook Air (2012).  Once Avast has completed its first scan of all of the files, does its continued operation noticeably affect battery life?\nIs the answer to this question known for alternative anti-virus programs?\n\nA: I tried installing Avast and adding this to crontab:\n* * * * * ps -o \\%cpu= -p $(pgrep -i com.avast) | awk '{s+=$0}END{print s}' >> ~/Notes/avast.txt\nThe average CPU use (for one core) after about a day was about 1.5%, but I'll keep it running for a few more days or weeks.\niStat Menus displays CPU power consumption in Sensors > CPU Package Total. Approximate CPU use and power consumption on my iMac:\n\n\n*\n\n*5%: 5W\n\n*100%: 13W\n\n*400%: 25W\n\n\nSo 1 percentage point increase in CPU use (for one core) from being near-idle might correspond to 1-2% increase in CPU power consumption. The ratio might be higher for laptops though. And the percentage change in total power consumption depends on the power consumption of displays and other components.\nIdle power consumptions with display off or at maximum brightness:\n\n\n*\n\n*11-inch MacBook Air: 4.7W, 9.0W\n\n*15-inch MacBook Pro with Retina Display: 5.3W, 17.6W\n\n*21.5-inch iMac: 14.1W, 41.8W\n\n\nA: In general; yes. Most anti-virus programs do on-demand scanning, meaning they check all files as they are being requested by various programs. This real time scanning requires drive access, processing and some memory, all of which contribute to a slower machine with less battery life.\nHowever, I'd heavily advice against the use of anti-virus programs on Macs. Anti-virus programs for Mac usually don't have any Mac virus signatures that they check for. The main point of these programs is to check for Windows viruses, and prevent accidental infection of coworkers'/family/friends' Windows PCs. Mac anti-virus programs tend to be scams, which although may offer legitimate detection of Windows virus, are simply meant to pray on users and push them into purchasing a paid product.\nApple does a GREAT job at patching up various vulnerabilities, so you should rest assured that your machine is very secure, as you're likely not a high profile enough personality to be worth the effort to hack.\n\nA: Avast free Mac Security does somewhat drain battery life. However, despite the disadvantages, I strongly suggest that you use it. I own a Macbook Pro Retina 2014 running OS X Yosemite and Avast has blocked 5+ web threats. I also use Avast to scan files from unknown sources and to scan files shuttled from USB sticks. From my experience, Avast lowers the battery life of my computer by about half an hour.\n", "Q: Understanding how safe boot fixed a boot problem Background\nMy friend asked me to look at her early 2011 Mac Mini with OS X 10.8.3. She said that: \n\n\n*\n\n*she installed software updates\n\n*she couldn't remember which updates were installed\n\n*when the Mac restarted, it hung at the Apple logo with the spinning gear wheel. \n\n\nI used Disk Utility to check permissions and the disk. Both checks found a few errors,  all of which were repaired. This did not help; after I rebooted, it hung at the same screen. \nSeveral resets of the PRAM did not help. \nSuccesses\nA safe boot succeeded, the desktop appeared. I re-checked permissions and the disk; no errors. \nThen a normal boot succeeded – this surprised me. \nQuestion\nCan anyone guess what was wrong and what was fixed? \nSince it's not my Mac, and I don't know how it's really used, I can't guess. \nI see Apple article HT1564, Mac OS X: What is Safe Boot, Safe Mode?, I'd like to understand more. \n\nA: I assume that at least one of the updates required a restart. \nAs Disk Utility found problems with the file system, it's possible that: \n\n\n*\n\n*some such problems existed before your friend attempted to install updates; and/or\n\n*some such problems arose from a forced shut down or forced restart during a problematic installation (before an automated restart), or force whilst awaiting progress following an automated restart (impatience with the spin). \n\n\nNo mention of force from you or your friend, so let's assume that: \n\n\n*\n\n*HFS Plus file system problems were present but unknown before installation\n\n*those problems caused an apparently successful installation to have a problematic end result. \n\n\nIn the 2013-05-06 edition of Apple's article: \n\nA Safe Boot deletes the dynamic loader shared cache at (/var/db/dyld/). A cache with issues may cause a blue screen on startup, particularly after a Software Update. Restarting normally recreates this cache.\n\nNot only blue screens. \nAlternative symptoms might include hangs of the type seen by you and your friend – the asynchronous progress indicator with the Apple logo. \nAlso, I do not find that a normal restart recreates that cache. To see whether the cache was recreated, at your friend's Mac in Terminal you might run the following command – be prepared for your friend to enter her administrative password at an on-screen prompt: \nsudo update_dyld_shared_cache -verify\nIf the output indicates that a file does not exist, then there may be: \n\n\n*\n\n*a problem with Apple's documentation (inconsistent with normal behaviour of the software); and/or\n\n*a problem with the software (abnormal behaviour). \n\n\nIf the command completes with no visible output, there's no problem (the file exists and is verified).\nReference\nupdate_dyld_shared_cache(1) Mac OS X Manual Page\n\nA: Starting up in safe mode also verifies (or repairs) the main OS X volume (like Macintosh HD, which is different from verifying a drive).\nStarting up in safe mode and restarting is the first troubleshooting step suggested in http://support.apple.com/kb/ts1417.\nThe verbose startup output when starting up in safe mode corresponds to the messages shown when verifying a volume in Disk Utility:\n\n\n\nA: Please read this succinct, clear Apple Support document.

I recently began to see some odd behavior on my MacBook Pro on Mountain Lion. I noticed the fans coming up and applications behaving sluggish. I checked the \nActivityMonitor (see below) and the results kept me puzzled: Although I list all processes, only very few show up that cause medium CPU usage, still the system CPU is at close to 70%.\nI've wondered about this behavior quite a while ago already and then - just as now - the problem just went away after about 10-15 minutes of lagging and fanning.\nWhat can cause these symptoms?

However, when the phenomenon occurred, my macbook's temperature went up excessively, as did the fans. That's not predicted by the \"throttling\" hypothesis, since presumably that would decrease energy use, so there's something else going on here.\nIt always went away after a little while (10 to 15 minutes), but something about the problem made the hairs on the back of my neck stand up, so I looked after a more permanent solution. I had a friend take a look, and he mentioned Count Foraii, so I did some more research (and talked with a few, shall we say, contacts), then covered my laptop in salt and set it on fire. \nIt hasn't done it again since.\n\nA: When your cpu is overheating system throttle it's frequency and voltages to cool it down, so this can explain lagging and fanning for a some amount of time and then returning to normal.\n", "Q: Can I decrypt a dm-crypt filesystem on OS X? I've been an Ubuntu user for years, and I just got my first Mac. One thing I haven't yet figured out is how to decrypt my encrypted filesystem on which I store my SSH and GPG keys on my flash drive. I used this guide in the past to set it up, and have just been running the shell script to decrypt and mount it since then.\nHowever, I cannot figure out how to decrypt it on OS X.

However, now I want to downgrade to Snow Leopard again. \nI made a USB thumb drive formatted as MacOS (External Journaled) to install Snow Leopard again (my CD drive doesn't work, that's why I made the USB flash drive). \nAnyway, when I'm trying to boot from the USB drive with the Option key and press the MacOS Install DVD icon, it gets stuck on the Apple logo forever. \nMy question is, do I have to first erase Mountain Lion completely and then try installing from the USB drive or is this a kind of a hardware problem? I'm thinking of formatting my hard disk but I'm scared of the Apple logo getting stuck again.\n\nA: The reason you can't boot from from the USB stick may be because it's a version of Snow Leopard that predates the one your Mac shipped with. Is the source version of Snow Leopard you're using a retail disc?\nAlso, downgrading directly from a newer OS is not supported behaviour. I've seen it attempted successfully (at least superficially) on a few occasions and, among other things, the OS does downgrade but the data doesn't. So iCal's data is geared up for the newer OS, etc etc.\nSo. The only way you're going to be able to do this properly is going to be by wiping your internal hard drive with Disk Utility, installing Snow Leopard, then setting everything up from scratch (manually installing your apps, moving important data, etc). I know it sucks, but it's going to be the only way everything will work properly.\n", "Q: WiFi: No Hardware Installed and using wifi adapter I am getting an error 'WiFi: No Hardware Installed' and am trying to use a micro usb wifi piece (http://www.amazon.com/computers-accessories/dp/B005CLMJLU).

Right around when I bought iPhone 5s for my wife and me I also moved in to a new, larger house. I was finding that wifi performance on our fancy new phones was terrible: I have a 35mbps internet connection but the performance was so bad that iCloud backups could rarely complete. The SpeedTest app would show that performance varied between 5mbps and 0mbps (no activity, just frozen). At first Apple replaced our iPhones, but that didn't help one bit.\nSince then, I've learned a few things: 2.4GHz signals perform poorly on iPhones and moderate on other devices, wile 5GHz performs very well (30mpbs+) on all devices, though range is limited with the iPhone compared to my MBP.\nIn order to compensate for this, I set my house up with two Airport Extremes connected via ethernet wired in the house: a 4th generation connected to my cable modem on one side of the house, and a 5th generation (hosting printer + disks) connected via ethernet broadcasting wifi on the other side of the house. I had hoped by doing this I could just use the 5GHz signal and the range issue would be addressed with my phones.\nSurprisingly, I found performance to be incredibly spotty -- to the point that network activity would stop entirely until I turned wifi off/on on the phone. On other devices, everything was fine. Debugging this further, what I discovered is that my 5th generation AE basically freezes up wifi traffic on my iPhones after a certain amount of traffic and it never recovers. I confirmed this by sending a separate wifi signal from that base station and connecting directly to it. Sure enough, SpeedTest clearly shows the weird behavior.\nI've tried various things:\n\n\n*\n\n*Holding Alt in the advanced settings to only broadcast N signals\n\n*Broadcasting combined as well as separate 2.4GHz and 5GHz signals\n\n*Switching between \"automatic\" and manual channels for both frequencies\n\n*With authentication on and off\n\n*With guest wifi on and off\n\n\nSo far, the results are consistent no matter what: my 5th generation AE seems to simply lock up when sending data through my iPhones. One strange thing I can't find answers on, and my gut says is part of the problem, is what exactly \"data rate\" means when looking at connected clients. For my laptops, it's always very high (150Mbps) but for my iDevices & AppleTV, it can range between 1Mbps (usually) and sometimes as high as 60Mbps. I can't find any documentation on what this really means, but I am assuming it's not a coincidence that higher numbers equal better performance \nDoes anyone have any tips on what to do here? I'm past my Apple Customer Care period for all my AEs and iPhones, but I'm glad to pay $20 for a one time ticket if it'll help. Is it possible my 5th gen AE is just broken? Has anyone else had 5th gen AE + iPhone 5 wifi issues?\nThanks!\nPS: I'm attaching a screenshot from my iPhone showing the weird behavior on my 5th gen AE. This does not happen on the 4th gen and I would just use that if it weren't for the unexpected range and 2.4GHz performance issues I'm also seeing.\nPPS: The wildcard in this whole thing may be interferrence. I have read that sattelite dishes can sometimes cause problems (we have DirecTV). Our house is not in a dense urban area, but we are on a hill and not too far away (half mile?) are quite a few major broadcast towers for the Portland TV (and radio?) markets.\n\n\nA: To understand signal vs noise, and how to interpret those numbers, see very useful guide, Airport Optimal Base Station Placement. \n", "Q: Upgrade os snow leopard to mountain lion without time machine My OSX is 10.6.8 and i want to upgrade to the last lion mountain version but i dont have any external disc drives, so i am not able to do a backup with the time machine.\nIs it very risky to do the upgrade without the time machine backup?\nTanks,\n\nA: Rule: Always back up at least your own document, photos etc — or your whole User Directory, if you've got the space - before any big changes. \nYou don't necessarily need to backup the OS — though a disk clone onto an external USB, made with SuperDuper or CarbonCopyCloner, is an instant rescue, right at hand, in the event of a crash or data loss, as well as another Startup Disk from which to repair your hard disk. \nIf you've got access to an OS install image, download or disks, in the event the upgrade doesn't go well and you need to downgrade, you don't need a clone (though it's easier) but just a copy of whatever you don't want to lose. \nRelated Rule: Always routinely back up / copy to somewhere else anything you don't want to lose. \nYou don't need Time Machine. It's just one method, one kind of external drive. \nI use Arc, for example, which backs up what I tell it to (to very cheap storage using A3) every night, silently, from the menubar. I also clone every few weeks to a small USB external.\nAnother inexpensive way is to copy / backup to a flash stick - mine holds 16GB, which is enough for my work. A photographer or video person would of course would need much larger backup and storage.\nIt's a broad subject — but just don't mess with big changes \"unprotected.\" Data loss happens. \nSave your data to DropBox, that's one easy step.\n\nA: Partition a section of your hard disk's free space, and copy the files you want to keep into there.\nUpgrade your version of OS X to Mountain Lion and then once the upgrade is complete, check it out. If everything is OK, move the important files back into the main drive and extend out the partition to recover the lost space.\nSecond option is to install DropBox and ensure it keeps a backup of the files that you want. Or use Mega, because they give you more free space and it's encrypted (don't forget your password!), and do a clean install, then copy the files you want back down afterwards.\n\nA: Not really? While it is always best to have a backup, as long as you have enough free space on your hard drive it should work.\n", "Q: Mail sent on iPhone via Safari or Twitter or other apps is never received, but email sent from within Mail is fine I am using iOS 6.1.4 on iPhone 5, and I've noticed that at some point in the past few weeks - I do not know exactly when it began - any email I try to send from within any non-Mail app, such as sharing links from within Safari, InstaPaper, Twitter, or Tweetbot, are never received by the recipient. The email does not show up in my Sent Items folder either. There is no error message displayed when trying to send these emails - I press Send and the email window is animated into the background as normal.\nI do not have any problem with sending emails from directly within the Mail app itself, these are received fine by recipients and show up in the Sent folder as expected. I have verified that the emails that originate from within Safari or other apps are not simply ending up in a Spam folder.\nI have two email accounts set up on my phone, Gmail and an Exchange account for work that I leave disabled/inactive most of the time. The Gmail account is set up as Exchange and the server name is listed as m.google.com with Use SSL enabled.\nHas anyone seen anything like this before or know what might be the cause?\n\nA: I thought I had tried this before, but powering off and restarting the phone has fixed everything. \n\nA: Your Gmail account shouldn't be set up as an Exchange account.  Gmail disabled Exchange ActiveSync for free Gmail accounts.  Instead, you should set up your Gmail account on your iPhone as an IMAP account.  Gmail's help details how to do it, but in short:\nFirst, you need to make sure that you have IMAP enabled on your Gmail account.\n\n\n*\n\n*sign in to Gmail on the website\n\n*click the gear icon to go to Settings\n\n*select \"forwarding and POP/IMAP\n\n*select \"enable IMAP\" \n\n*click \"save\"\n\n\nNow, back on your iPhone, set up your Gmail account as an IMAP account.\n\n\n*\n\n*open the Settings app\n\n*tap Mail\n\n*tap \"add account\"\n\n*tap \"Gmail\"\n\n*enter the requested information (use your full Gmail address, including @gmail.com)\n\n*tap \"next\"\n\n*tap \"save\"\n\n\nConfirm that it's working, and then you can delete your old Exchange-based entry for Gmail.\n", "Q: renamed vecLib.framework, now can't use PAM, sudo, App Store... Error Code -8076 Well, I think I really messed things up :) While trying to build the NumPy Python math module with Intel's Math Kernel Library (MKL), I was running into some problems with the Accelerate and vecLib frameworks overriding the MKL. At any rate, I decided it would be a good idea to rename /System/Library/Frameworks/Accelerate.framework and /System/Library/Frameworks/vecLib.framework temporarily. Nothing happened after moving Accelerate.framework. However, after entering \nsudo mv vecLib.framework/ vecLib.framework.old\n\nI got the following error:\nsudo: unable to initialize PAM: No such file or directory\n\nOops. Unfortunately, the mv command worked, but now when I try to use sudo I get the same error, but the commands don't work. When I tried to rename vecLib through Finder, I get:\nThe operation can’t be completed.\nAn unexpected error occurred (error code -8076).\n\nwhich apparently is some sort of permissions error. \nSo, my question is how can I get sudo working again? App Store.app won't even run, so I can't reinstall XCode (which is apparently where vecLib.framework comes from) or anything else. I'm afraid to reboot because I'm worried the computer will hang, whereas (as you can tell) at least it's working for now, albeit without any elevated permissions capabilities. \nAny suggestions?\nBTW, I'm running 10.8.3.\n\nA: Just try restarting. Even if you can't start up normally, you can still probably start up from the recovery partition or in single user mode.\nIf nothing else works, try doing an upgrade install of OS X by starting up from the recovery partition and choosing Reinstall OS X. It downloads an OS X installer and replaces some system files with the initial versions. I have done it twice so far and it fixed multiple issues both times, so I have started to consider it as a troubleshooting step (but no-one ever does it when I recommend it here).\n", "Q: How can I use Jabber with OTR on IOS?

I acquired them from a client I did some work for awhile back who gave me some Apple hardware that he wasn't using anymore as payment since they were struggling. I don't have a huge Apple knowledge base...\nIs there a way I can link these two base stations together to create a bridge to connect a wired device to my network across my house? The wall I need to go through doesn't have a good way to run a cable so I'm looking for alternative solutions, I basically want to connect a CAT6 cable from my device to one of the Airport Express stations and then I want to connect a CAT6 cable from my router to the other Airport Express station and have the device be reaching the router.\nI searched for a couple of articles and from what I read you can create a WiFi to ethernet bridge using just one of these devices since my router isn't an Apple router. I was hoping someone here may have a creative solution on how I can use both of these devices to accomplish my task.\nThanks!\n\nA: You may be able to do this with the \"Extend a wireless network\" option within the Airport Extreme, but a better solution may be to use power adapters to extend your network.\n\nA: I think this should work. \nYou can plug in one into a router on the network side and configure that Airport Express it as to create a wireless network (i.e. that Airport will make a WLAN with name and password).  You can test that part if with a mobile phone or laptop you can log into that WLAN to access your stuff there.\nThen with the device side, configure it's WLAN as \"Join existing network\" and give it the name and login credentials of the other.  You may have to provide the device with a static IP address though that would fit into the LAN on the other side.\n", "Q: Create hotkey to open a menubar app? Is it possible to create a hotkey (or other trigger) that opens a menubar app?  I don't mean launch.  I mean, cause the menubar app to display its contents.\nLet's say, for example, I wanted to create a hotkey to open a menubar weather app.  Can this be done?\nThe app I'm trying to open is open source on Github, so I'm open to coding the trigger into the app if need be, but I have no clue how to do that, which means I'd prefer a simpler solution.\nI'm using Mountain Lion.\n\nA: You can assign a shortcut to a script like this:\nignoring application responses\n    tell application \"System Events\" to tell process \"QuickHue\"\n        click menu bar item 1 of menu bar 1\n    end tell\nend ignoring\n\nThere is a bug where clicking some status menu items causes scripts to be blocked for about 5 seconds. One workaround is to terminate System Events after the click command:\nlaunch application \"System Events\"\ndelay 0.2\nignoring application responses\n    tell application \"System Events\" to tell process \"Time Tracker\"\n        click menu bar item 1 of menu bar 2\n    end tell\nend ignoring\ndo shell script \"killall System\\\\ Events\"\ndelay 0.1\ntell application \"System Events\" to tell process \"Time Tracker\"\n    tell menu bar item 1 of menu bar 2\n        click menu item 2 of menu 1\n    end tell\nend tell\n\nThe first two lines are needed when System Events is not already running.

I have about 300 songs that were purchased with my ex-wifes account.  I can't play them because they have a different Apple ID and were purchased by her account.  Does anyone know how to \"sort\" for those songs so I can deleter them?\n\nA: Doug's AppleScripts for iTunes contains a script that should be useful for you. The Track Down Purchases script can sort your purchases into playlists separated by account name, which should make it easy for you to find and subsequently delete songs not on your account.\n", "Q: If I put my old mac hard disk system drive with bootcamp in a USB caddy, after replacing it with an SSD, will it appear as 2 drives when plugged in? I'm going to replace my MacBookPro system drive / hard disk with an SSD.

One for the MacOS partition and one for the NTFS partition?\n(When I've put a partitioned drive in a USB external caddy and then plugged it into a Windows machine, several drives appear, 1 per partition.)\n\nA: You'll see drives like as it was internally, just with a different icon.  You will even be able to boot from the external MacOS (press and hold alt-key when the system chimes on power-up), but this (boot from USB) will not work for Windows.  \nBut the files will be accessible as before.\n\nA: Yes, you will see a mounted drive for each existing partition on the existing internal drive.\n\nA: I did this before and the partitions appear on the desktop like USB pen drives or other drives you plug in.

My 1 TB Time Capsule drive is full with Time Machine backups.  I'd rather spend $130 on a 3 TB drive than $500 on a new 3 TB Time Capsule.\nIs an external drive attached to a Time Capsule supported for Time Machine backups?  I have read that trying to use Time Machine with an Airport Extreme and an attached external drive is not supported and is in fact unreliable.  Does that extend to Time Capsules with an external drive?\nI realize that a Time Machine backup cannot be split across drives -- I would move entire backups to the 3 TB drive.\nI bought my 1st generation Time Capsule (MB277LL/A) in 2008. I am running Mountain Lion.\n\nA: Yes. You can use Time Machine with a drive connected to a Time Capsule.\nThis Apple support doc - Backup disks you can use with Time Machine (as of Sept 2015) - says:\n\nTime Machine can back up the data on your Mac to these backup disks:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*An external USB, Thunderbolt, or FireWire drive connected to your Mac\n  \n*An AirPort Time Capsule's built-in drive (any model) \n  \n*An external USB drive connected to an AirPort Time Capsule (any model) or AirPort Extreme (802.11ac model only)\n  \n*Network volumes connected using Apple File Protocol (AFP)\n  \n\n\nA: Update: Now Officially Supported\nAt the time this was written (May 2013), the answer below was correct. Apple introduced new hardware, the Airport ExtremeBase Station (802.11ac) (6th generation) in June of 2013, and backing up to an external drive connected to an AirPort Extreme Base Station (802.11ac) or later AirPort Time Capsule is officially supported. Unfortunately, Apple no longer makes the Time Capsule or AirPort extreme. Also note that while for a long time Apple only supported network backups using AFP (Apple Filing Protocol), they have dropped AFP in favor of current SMB (that is, SMB3) protocols. This support article seems to be getting updates as the support situation evolves. \nSo, in 2019, your options for wireless backups appear to be a NAS with SMB3 support and advertised Time Machine compatibility or a Mac shared as a Time Machine backup destination (see support article linked above).\nOriginal Answer\nIt is not officially supported.  \"Time Machine can’t backup to an external drive that's connected to an AirPort Extreme, Time Capsule, or a drive formatted for Microsoft Windows (NTFS or FAT format). (Click on \"Setting up Time Machine backups using an external drive\" to reveal the information.)(Update August 2019: the original link now redirects you to current documentation. For historical information, see also Disks that can be used with Time Machine) This is usually because of issues with the network file system not guaranteeing that writes have completed on disk before giving a \"success\" status. \n\nA: Yes, it's supported.\nMy 2015 Time Capsule hard drive failed after two years of use and I was considering getting it fixed. Instead, I've attached a 2TB Western Digital USB drive formatted as OS X Extended Journaled. \nTime Capsule immediately detected it (you can see this in Airport Utility) and I could switch to the new drive in my Time Machine preferences pane.\nNote that the USB drive has to have it's own power source, as Time Capsule doesn't provide any power on it's single USB port.\n", "Q: Is there way to quickly call the active contact on the Message app?

Run Activity-Monitor (Applications>Utilities) to see how much of your RAM is used.  Most Mac stuff runs well on 4GB, but if you run memory intense stuff (Parallels-Windows, Video Editing, editing large pictures with photoshop) you should see an improvement.  But even if you don't need the RAM, you should not see a performance penalty (i.e. it may or may not run better, but won't run worse).\nUnless your computer is already slowing down to a crawl with the current configuration (when doing memory intense work), adding 2x 2GB should be enough (giving you a total of 8GB).\nSo, given your configuration, I'd add 2x 2GB to the free slots and keep the memory that is already there in the other slot.  \n\nA: Apple has a bunch of support articles on their Support site, just pick the one which applies to your model.\n\nA: I second Patrix's answer.\nAs for the overall performance impact, as long as you install the correct type of RAM in duals (meaning 2 sticks of the same type), it should boost your performance.\nYou need to pay attention to how much RAM your iMac model takes as maximum. You already have 4GB; check if it's possible for you to replace both sticks to 2x4GB for a total of 8GB.\nUpdate based on the comment below:\nThis article lists the steps necessary to add/change RAM for your iMac model. Your iMac model (Late 2009) contains 4 RAM slots; each slot can hold 4 GB maximum for a total of 16 GB RAM. The RAM type is SO-DIMMs 1066 MHz DDR3 SDRAM.

I recently did a \"restore\" of my iPhone, and loaded data in from a backup (an iTunes backup, not iCloud) So, all my apps were gone- I had to re-download them. So I did, but I noticed that when I did so, the data was all still there.\nHowever, I didn't (and don't want to) reload all the apps I had installed. So, what I want to do is be able to see which other \"not currently installed\" apps have data on the device, and be able to delete some of them. How do I do this? \n(Or, was it actually just pulling this data from iCloud, despite that I was using an iTunes backup?)\n\nA: Yes, you're just syncing the App's data with iCloud, as no files are leftover when an App is deleted. \niOS apps (and now  OS X  apps too), are Sandboxed. This means that each App has its own space in disk, with its own directories, which act as the home for the App and its data.Deleting an app from the iPhone deletes this sandbox, deleting all data associated with the App.\nSo, if an App supports iCloud sync, whenever you install that App with your Apple ID, in any of your devices, all the information will be synced. \n", "Q: Mail.app Assumes Google is the Desired Service for a Self-Hosted Domain I am migrating from Google Apps for Domains to a self-hosted service. After removing my Google account from Mail, and attempting to add my self-hosted account, Mail and System Preferences always default to Google as the provider for my email. DNS records have been switched (mail flow works fine from my self-hosted service).\nEvery time I attempt to add a new account, it assumes I want the Google account it discovers and not my personal email.\nI have uninstalled Gmail from the Google Apps for Domains control panel, but this has not helped (yet). I have also removed my preferences folder for Mail.app, but this does not help either.\nI cannot delete or rename this Google account; other services are attached to it.\nAny suggestions?\nI had previously thought that by changing the passwords to differ after uninstalling Gmail, it was working. However, while it lets you add a different IMAP account, the type is still \"Google IMAP\", which causes issues when trying to setup the accounts properly (most notably because I also have a self-hosted CalDAV account).\nAfter further testing, I have found that any IMAP account I attempt to create is set as a \"Google IMAP\" account once I provide the self-hosted domain (meaning, even if I create it with fictitious information and later supply the domain only when I have to). How can I address this?\n\nA: I was able to finally resolve this. Here's a simplified version of the breakdown (in a corrected order), in hopes that it is helpful to anyone trapped in this in the future:\n\n\n*\n\n*Setup the self-hosted service\n\n*Switch DNS records to point to the self-hosted service\n\n*Ensure your Mac or iOS device is aware of this DNS change (e.g. dig domain.com mx in Terminal returns what you expect to see)\n\n*Uninstall Gmail and Calendar from the Google Apps for Domains Control Panel (your data will not be lost; you can reactivate them later)\n\n*Remove the Google Apps account from your device\n\n*Add a new email account with the correct information:\n\n*\n\n*After clicking \"Continue\" on the screen where you enter your name, email address and password, immediately press \"Cancel\", then\n\"Continue\" again. This ensures no automatic search for services is\ndone.

I had an update to install so I installed that update, to no avail.\nI haven't tried resetting the entire device yet mainly due to I don't see that helping either as this is happening on multiple devices.\nAs my iPhone is the camera that I usually use, this is really frustrating and especially as I noticed this during my daughters very first football practice.. Does anyone have any ideas on that the problem is and how I can fix it?\nUpdate 2013-05-31\nAs suggested by @bassplayer7 I reset one of my devices without restoring it from backup and that brought the camera app back. He suggested I reset it again after that and restored it from backup to se if that fixed the issue, however, I am keeping it this way. Having a freshly formatted phone was really great.\nI am however going to look into the actual issue on my iPad and try to find a fix for everyone else having this issue. Resetting should not and can not be the only solution to this problem.\n\nA: It can't be deleted it's one of the built-in apps. If you can't find it on any of your homescreens or app folders, and you can't find it via the spotlight search screen (swipe your first home screen to the right), then is it hidden by Settings > General > Restrictions > Camera being set 'off' ?\nIf not then have you tried a reset to see if you can find it after the iPad has restarted ? Press and hold both the sleep and home buttons for about 10 to 15 seconds (ignore the red slider), after which the Apple logo should appear - you won't lose any content, it's the iPad equivalent of a reboot.\nIf that doesn't find it then have you got an Exchange email account set up on the iPad ? If so then the account administrator might be hiding the Camera app - you could try removing the account and see if it re-appears.\n", "Q: Samsung SSD in older Imac (24\" Alu)? Trim support? I have an older 24\" iMac (Model 8.1 with Mountain Lion) and would like to extend its life a bit by adding a 256GB SSD.  Samsung SSDs seem to be coming down in price (and are possibly well reusable if the iMac retires at some point) and I've looked at the tear-down of the model which appears to be doable (no glued parts).\nDoes anyone have experience with putting 3rd party SSDs in an older machine?  And if so, will it support SDD TRIM?\n\nA: I installed a (Samsung) SSD into a late 2008 Aluminum MacBook, which worked fine.\nApple does not automatically support TRIM for drives that aren't their own, but it can be enabled, for instance with this app: http://www.groths.org/trim-enabler/\nWorked for me, just needs to be re-enabled after every system software update.\nAnd yes, my MacBook is now a lot faster, so installing an SSD can definitely breathe new life into an old machine.\n\nA: Yes, I'm posting this from an 24\" Alu (7,1 model) which uses a Corsair SSD. I'd assume it would be the same with Samsung. Trim can be enabled.  Instructions are here (it will patch the kext driver for the SSD and worked fine for me).\n", "Q: Auto close windows that pop up? I have some apps that keep popping up ad windows. I want to find a way to automatically close certain app windows as soon as they appear. On Windows, I normally make a simple app in AutoIt and run it.

My question is one of confusion.  All over the internet I have seen people looking for the ability to use a Mac to write to NTFS, or people formatting drives to FAT32 so that their Mac can share a storage drive with a PC.  \nI am experiencing the opposite effect.  \nI recently hooked up a Western Digital (WD) My Book 3 Terabyte drive to my network.  I connected both my PC and my Macbook Pro to it.  The Mac put a bunch of hidden folders on the drive, and my PC added it's own shared files.  The drive, from the perspective of the PC says the drive file format is NTFS.  I am able to access the shared drive as a Guest, from my Mac, and I can view all the files, add files (I added a picture) and pull music off the drive, and play it.  \nI don't have a problem with this, but I'm wondering how this is possible?  \nI have made 1 attempt to back-up on the network drive using Time Machine.  It was too slow over the wi-fi so I canceled, but it didn't come up with any pop-ups that said the back-up was failing.  \nBecause it's a network drive, is there some kind of conversion going on?  I haven't installed any programs to write to NTFS on my Mac.  \nI would also like to know if I am damaging the Network drive in any way by using both the MAC and PC on it.  \nNote:  My MacBook Pro does not see the Network drive as a Hard Drive, and I cannot use the Disc Utility to format it.  It only sees it as a shared drive in the Network.\n\nA: Over the network it does not matter what file system is used on the hardware drive, because the computer hosting the drive (making it available through the network) will access it.  Your Mac will just make generalized requests over the network for files, folders, etc. and the host will access the file system and serve the files. Network requests are standardized and the host answers them and converts between those and the actual file system on the hardware. \nWhat you were reading about not being able to write to NTFS, was people who either had a partition with NTFS on their native HD in the Mac computer or who were attaching USB drives.  In both these cases, the Mac has to access (and possibly modify) the file system on drive directly (without an intermediate agent) and needs to be able to deal with the specifics of the file system directly.\nAnd no, there is no danger of damage (well, not unless you or the Mac intentionally delete files or move folders that are needed otherwise).\n", "Q: Safari 6 freezing I've recently upgraded to Safari 6 in Lion and I'm seeing some pages freeze: I cannot scroll down and sometimes cannot click on anything. Safari is still alive and working but the freeze cannot be fixed by reloading the page.\nA short Google session turned up a few comments about this being a problem with Javascript (apparently Safari is using a new engine). Sure enough, if I disable Javascript (using the Debug menu), then the freeze is gone after reloading the page.

Driver without iTunes? On a Windows 8 machine, I've connected an iPhone 4s. Windows makes a audible chime for 'device connected', but doesn't allow charging in any USB port.\niTunes isn't installed, and cannot be installed at this time under corporate policy.\nThe iPhone shows as a generic device / toaster under Control Panel's Devices as below. The iPhone does NOT show as charging.\nIs there a driver to install to ensure the iPhone is detected and can charge via USB without installing iTunes?\nI've tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*forcing Windows Update \n\n\n\n\nA: Just download iTunes, open the .exe file with winrar or some other similar software and then run the AppleMobileDeviceSupport(64).msi executable from there.\n\nA: Hm, if your company denies access for installing iTunes, I doubt you would be able to tweak/install drivers. Having said this, you might want to try this to only install the needed driver without having to resort to iTunes: Install iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad drivers without installing iTunes \n\nA: No driver is needed on the iPhone side (nor should it be required on the PC end).\nThe iPhone - even if 100% totally dead - should present itself as a USB device that would like power to run. Once the charging circuitry starts, on a Mac the iPhone asks for any high power ports to charge the phone more rapidly than a typical USB device.\nThis is basically something the computer does so your PC should just send the normal USB charge over the power lines. The charge will be slower, so you might power off the phone (or lock the screen) to let it use as little power as possible to maximize the charge from your PC.\n\nA: Windows is \"stupid\" and has typically installed the wrong driver. Yes, over the Apple driver and yes, it does this regularly.\nAmong other things, drivers decide how much, if any, power is available to plugged in USB devices.\nThe fix is to remove Window's drivers and upgrade them to the Apple one:\nTo remove Microsoft's broken driver\n\n*\n\n*Go to the Start menu via Win or Cmd\n\n*Type \"Device settings\" to go to the app that manages drivers\n\n*Locate, under \"Other devices\" the device called \"iPhone\" with \"Driver problem\"\n\n*Remove the driver\n\nTo install Apple's correct driver\n\n*\n\n*Go to the Start menu via Win or Cmd\n\n\n*Type \"Device Manager\" to go to the windows app that manages drivers\n\n\n*Locate, under \"Portable devices\" the device called \"iPhone\"\n\n\n*Right click and choose \"Update driver software...\"\n\n\n*Choose \"Browse my computer for driver software\"\n\n\n*Search for driver software in this location\n C:\\Program Files\\Common Files\\Apple\\Mobile Device Support\\Drivers\n\n\n\n*Next/Finish\nNote: you need to install iTunes to have the drivers in that folder (I think)\n\nA: If the driver is not installed properly, the phone will not be detected by the computer and if that happens, the phone will not charge.\nMake sure drive is installed properly.\n\nA: under devices and driver, simply remove the iphone then unplug it and plug it back in\n\nA: I had the same problem. Went to the suggested location (see post below) and let Windows search for an update for this driver online. It found it, updated it, and then the iPhone began charging.\nNo iTunes installed on this machine. \n\nA: Just download iTunes, open the .exe file with winrar or some other similar software and then run the AppleMobileDeviceSupport(64).msi executable from there.\nIf you receive an \"Apple Mobile Device Service failed to start\" error, run the AppleApplicationSupport(64).msi executable as well. Otherwise, you may have issues such as the iPhone prompting you to trust the computer every time it is connected.\n", "Q: Is there an app available from the App Store (iOS) to find out the LAN speed? I'm trying to see if it would be worthwhile to upgrade my PC computer to a 5 GHz wireless adapter. The only device I own that is capable of using the 5 GHz band is my iPad. So, I'm trying to see if it's possible to measure LAN speeds on my iPad. So, any ideas?\n\nA: If you want to measure the speed (bandwidth) between your iPad and your PC, take a look at iperf.  It is available for computers and there are versions on the App Store for iOS too (the one I use seems to have gone away, but searching the App Store for \"iperf\" reveals several possible options).\nYou run an iperf server at one end (eg the PC), and a client at the other (eg the iPad).  It runs for a configurable amount of time (I think the default is 1 minute), and then tells you how much data it managed to transfer.\nCompared to eg copying a file, the figures you get this way are a more accurate reflection of the available network speed, because copying a file requires retrieving the data from a hard drive, writing it at the other end, sending acknowledgements, the overhead of the file transfer protocol etc... iPerf is simpler than that: it just transfers data as fast as it can.\n\nA: Yes - Apple's AirPort utility will show you the connection details for each device that connects to an AirPort base station. If you don't have Apple networking gear, I don't believe there are plug ins to make other routers look enough like Apple gear, so this clearly won't help everyone.\nThe utility shows you three items that are most critical to determining how good a link you have between your device and the base station:\n\nHere you can see there is a decently fast Data Rate negotiated between an iPad and a base station as well as RSSI and PHY - or Physical Layer Radio Mode of the 802.11n standard\n\nAt this point, you can then do the math - what is the bandwidth / latency / speed upstream of the router and also see how your computer is currently connecting to the network. If you find that the limiting factor is often the link between the computer and the router - you can upgrade knowing you will improve that bottleneck and place it somewhere else (or at least raise it to a higher speed on Wi-Fi)\n\nA: Off the top of my head, I cannot think of any applications on the iOS store for an iPad that would measure local network speed. Your PC on a 5ghz wi-fi adapter is more than enough speed for the internet. Unless you do intensive file transfers within your local network, what you already have or an upgraded WAN will be fine. You don't need the LAN cable.\nHowever, to measure your local network speed, get onto two desktop computers, and then sharing a large file between them. Record how long the file transfer takes, and then report back here with the results.\n\nA: Given your setup the limit on speed is probaly the Wan. I would try testing on both WiFi speeds, I would doubt yousee much difference, probaly more important to check you channel is not affected by other nearby WiFi stations.\nThere are iOS apps that can test the speed of loading from a web site.\nThe one I have used is Speedtest\n\nA: I myself found the apps speedy net and wifiperf with which you can measure network speed between two ios or mac devices or a mac and ios device over your router. Maybe this information is usefull for you or anybody els that surfs by.\n\nA: You could try connecting a gigabit ethernet computer to your router and running a transfer from the iPad to the computer, then trying a transfer between the wireless computer and the ethernet one and comparing the speeds\n\nA: There is iPerf/iPerf3 distribution on IOS named as NetPerf which can test wireless to wire(LAN) bandwidth or vice versa\n\nA: i believe cloud check\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/app/cloudcheck/id722428563?mt=8\nor wi-fi sweetspot\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wi-fi-sweetspots/id855457383?mt=8\nwill kind of do that for you.. but it appeasr to give instantaneous connection speed.. not negotiated speed.\nnor does it provide other details such as band/freq etc..\nbut its (currently) free so migth be worth a look.\n", "Q: Syncing old phone with new computer - what is this message?

For my heavy used documents, I'd like to store them on my home screen.\nI'm prepared to jailbreak if needed.\n\nA: If you jailbreak, you can install file:// in MobileSafari from Cydia. this would allow you to place text files somewhere in your filesystem (using iFile, also available from cydia) and access them from MobileSafari. for example, a file called text.txt in the root / directory would be file:///text.txt.\nYou can just open these files in MobileSafari and then add them to your home screen.\n\nA: Unfortunately, I cannot give you any answer to adding a text file to the home screen without jailbreak. The answer above should tend to your jailbreak needs. But, if you are interested in how to add a text file to the Safari bookmark menu, read on.\nNothing is actually stored on the home screen. It just links to the apps and web links. But, you use PlainText. So you can do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Safari and navigate to any webpage, about:blank will do.\n\n*Save the page as bookmark.

How do I edit songs that are in the Music app on my iPhone 5?  I need to delete some songs that were automatically synced that I don't want.\n\nA: iOS 7 has changed the face of the Music app somewhat. The biggest thing that was introduced is that now, all of you iTunes store music purchases show up automatically in the Music.app. This allows you to stream those songs without actually storing them on your device (an excellent option). \nAs a result you have two options:\n\n\n*\n\n*You can manage music the old way by opening Settings.app -> Music -> and disabling \"Show All Music\". This will prevent your purchases from displaying in the music app. To delete any songs that you have on there, you can swipe (from right to left) and select Delete (on the actual songs themselves - this doesn't work on albums).\n\n*When \"Show All Music\" is enabled, I don't believe there is any way to remove songs that were purchased through iTunes. If you are not on wifi, you can go to Settings.app -> Cellular -> disable \"Music\", which will prevent any songs that haven't been downloaded from streaming over cellular data (and which would prevent those songs from playing if that's your desire).\n\nThe following is is for iOS 6\nYes, you can.\nTo delete single songs in Music.app slide from one direction towards the other on a particular song and select \"Delete\". You can also use this approach with Playlists, Albums, Artists, etc.\nIf you seeking to delete or edit playlists you can see those buttons at the top of each playlist.\nKeep in mind, unless you make the needed changes on your computer, these deleted songs/artists/albums/playlists with sync back to your iPhone.\n\nA: Actually, there are methods to only check and sync certain songs to your iOS. After connecting your iPhone to iTunes, uncheck the songs you don't want to transfer, then find and check the \"Sync only checked songs and videos\" box and \"Sync only checked songs and videos\".\nA better solution I personally prefer, is to use something like imElfin iTransfer, which allows me to choose and transfer songs and other stuff very flexibly.\n\nA: For iOS 11, there is no longer an option under Settings > Music named \"Show All Music\". Instead, from the Music home, you select \"Downloaded Music\" row, and the \"Songs\" and \"Playlists\" rows under this scene will be filtered accordingly.\nI have a similar problem to yours. My smart playlists looked fine on my Mac in iTunes but when I synced them to my iOS device, the smart playlists pulled in songs that I did not want from my iTunes Store purchases. I had unchecked these songs in iTunes on my Mac. On iOS, these unwanted songs had a cloud icon beside their name in my smart playlists.

I have a 13\" late '11 MBP OS X Lion 10.7.5 I am trying to hook up to my LG HDTV with a Thunderbolt HDMI cable.  Getting the display onto the TV is a snap.  The audio, however, is not working.  The thing I'm noticing is in the Sound tab the TV is not an option for Sound Effect, Output, or Input, only internal speakers and aggregate device.  \nI have updated my software, reset SMC and PRAM, gone to Audio MIDI Setup (where the TV isn't optional), plugged the Thunderbolt in while the TV was off/on, etc.    Can someone tell me why the TV is not appearing in the Sound options?\n\nA: That model of MBP supports audio through that adapter, so you should be getting sound. It could be any number of things. I think your problem is on the TV side, but Here are a bunch of things to try: \nFirst, make sure you're connected to your TV and getting an HDMI video signal to the  video input you've selected.\nGo to your MIDI Audio Setup again and make sure that your thunderbolt output is set to \"Use this device for sound output.\" Highlight it, and go down to the setup (gear icon below) to set it.\nFrom your Apple Menu, open your System Preferences and choose Sound. Try setting your \"Use audio port for:\" to Sound Input, as it may be hogging the audio out channel and not letting your thunderbolt use it. Make sure your system volume is turned up there too.\nIf you have various sound drivers installed and showing up in Audio MIDI Setup, just leave them alone for now, and DO NOT use any aggregate devices. Select your thunderbolt output and make sure the volume sliders are turned up. You should see the speaker icon next to that audio output selection too. We're not interested in \"Sound Effects\" in this case, so don't worry about that.\nRecheck ALL your connections.\nMake sure your volume is turned up on the MBP.\nTHe content you're trying to play probably has a volume control of it's own too. Make sure it's turned up.\nAnd make sure that your TV volume is up, and not accidentally on Mute.\nIF your TV's set up to play audio through your amplifier (surround, etc.) make sure your amp is on, set to TV as it's input, and volume is up. Don't turn these all up to max! When you find the culprit, you don't want to blow anything out.\nMake sure your TV isn't in SAP mode.\nCheck to make sure you don't already have an audio source plugged into the audio jacks for that input on your TV. HDMI only on that TV input.\nCheck the setup options for Audio in the app you're using to play your content. If it's a movie, for instance, and you're using VLC as your player, check your Audio Device setup in the Audio menu option.\nMake sure your TV isn't setup to expect audio from it's Stereo input jacks, as if you were connecting via component video and audio. Light up the menu options on your TV, and just double check your Audio options settings. Maybe that input port on your TV is pre-set to expect only separate stereo jacks on that input. Just a thought. You might try another HDMI input on your TV just as a test.\nTry a different HDMI cable if you've got one.\nThat's all I can think of. I have a feeling one of these will solve the problem.\n\nA: I have had the same problem but I put the adapter in my iMac and both sound and display worked. The adapter manufacture support (StarTech) said it was my MacBook Air's thunderbolt port and I should take it to Apple to check out.\nWait till I tell you what I did and got it to work. I have bootcamp set up so I booted my MacBook up on the Windows side and it worked perfectly. Now that I know that the port is good I still do not know why it will not work on the mac side of my computer.\n\nA: I had the same problem. went to system preferences, open sound, output, selected my samsung tv as output and it instantly switched sound from laptop to tv.\n\nA: Some monitors don't have speakers, when plugging into the two I have, there is no option to send audio through to the monitor; on other television monitors the option is there. The OS X sees the monitor and calls it by name, so there must be something in the return signal sent from the monitor that \"tells\" the OS if it is capable of audio.\n\nA: Using the Sound Setting in System Preference solved the problem. Once the HDMI is plugged between the adapter and the TV, a new option shows up in the Sound setting. I think it says \"Use TV as sound output\", then choose that. The sound control transfers to the TV (but you can't control Audio in Mac in this setting, it's disabled). Of course, you will use the TV remote from here on.\n\nA: After all these years, most the above answers are wrong. \nHe has NO OPTION for his TV in the Sound Tab Output when he plug the TV. \nIf his TV was showed up on the Sound Preference then it's another case\nBut gmacd77 share some green light there. Not sure did he finally managed to get it working under OSX\nI have exact same problem. I've tried 4 adapters, 2 TVs and test with 3 Macs.. everything works normally\nOnly my MacbookAir6.2 under OSX are having this Issue\n\nA: System Preferences → Sound → Samsung HDMI is the solution.\n\nA: \"System Preferences → Sound → Samsung HDMI is the solution.\" \nThis got downvoted but it actually worked for me.  \nSystem preferences, sound, selected tv.  Then it didnt work and I raged a bit.  THEN i realised I had to click on \"Output Sound\" which opened a new tab.   Then i clicked select output sound and then clicked on my Tv.  Worked.\nI was happy about it because this problem has been pissing me off for a while.  \n", "Q: Read Remote Changes to a Published Calendar before Publishing I have a calendar in Calendar.app which publishes to a server as an ics file. I can subscribe to this same calendar using the URL used to publish to it (both actions require authentication). However, this requires two separate calendars. What I want is to be able to publish to it and view any updates to it, as it might be changed from another client.\nThe current behavior is that any remote change to this ics is smothered by the next update from the local published calendar, which never checks the ics for changes before completely rewriting it.\n\nA: I discovered this is \"working as intended\", and switched to a CalDAV implementation, as it performs the functions I'm looking for.\n", "Q: Application update, what will be the release date in appstore I recently have released a game for the iOS iPhone devices for which I saw was at the top of the \"Release Date\" list under the relevant category.\nUnfortunately, I had to remove the game from the App Store due to some changes, so I changed the release date to somewhere in the future while I uploaded an update which is waiting for review.\nWhen the update will be approved, Will it be considered released at the same day of the update approval or at the day when the first version was approved?\n\nA: Nowadays, apps submitted to the App Store will take 6 to 8 days to be reviewed based on how many apps are queued for review.\nIf your application is showing the status Waiting for Review, it means your app is not yet reviewed by Apple. Once the review process has started, your app will show the status  Under Review.\nUpdates and new releases follow the same rules.\nYou can also refer here.\n\nA: Well, my update is finally up in the air but unfortunately it is no longer appears as on of the firsts in the release date tabs so Apple probably is using the release date of the first version. \n", "Q: Macbook Pro Keyboard Functions Stopped Working on Bootcamp I have a MacBook Pro 15\" with Mountain Lion 10.8.\nI've had the laptop for about 8 months now and I installed Bootcamp probably around a week after I got it.

If I reset my password using the Mac OS X install media, will I loose all data stored in my computer?\n\nA: No you will not, resetting your password using the installation media will leave all data intact. However if you are using Filevault you would need your password or the recovery key to access any encrypted data. \n", "Q: Turn off encrypted backup on iPhone that has a profile without removing profiles I have iPhones that have profiles on them that were password protected profiles and those passwords have been lost.  So we need to wipe the iphones and was hoping to to a backup first and then restore without the profiles on there.  Problem is, it won't let me do a backup without encrypting first.  I have read that in order to not encrypt the backup you need to remove the profiles, but in this case we can't remove the profiles.\nIs there any way to turn this encryption off??\n\nA: When you have a profile that enforces encryption of backups, you really only have three options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Live with the encrypted backups and do nothing.\n\n*Get someone to remove the profile (or wipe the device along with the profile and start over being careful to not allow profiles that force you into encrypted backups).\n\n*Somehow exploit a bug or flaw in the security of iOS and bypass this lock. I would expect you to pay big money or have some assistance from NSA-like organization to accomplish this last item unless someone publishes a weakness in iOS that we could take advantage of to bypass the security your iPhone has configured.\n\n\nAs it stands, you will likely have to remove the profile to bypass the restriction that iOS has on not doing a backup in the manner you wish.\n\nA: You can't access your old encrypted iPhone backups if you can't remember the password. However, iTunes can create a new backup of the iPhone without encrypting the backup, see here for details.\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/ht4946\nAlternatively, you could use a 3rd party app to backup your iPhone without iTunes.\n\nA: I had a similar issue and found an installed (provisioning) profile is not letting non-encrypted backups to be made, see my write-up here: https://wiitez.blogspot.sg/2016/12/how-to-disable-iphone-requiring-backup.html\n\nA: There is software that basically spends all day guessing it. I had to do this once when I remembered most of the password but forgot exactly it (forget which one I used). You can put in perimeters o speed things up like 12 characters no numbers no special characters. And when it guesses it you pay for the program and can unhindered the password.\n", "Q: Copying all my data to new disk, without resorting to Time Machine/Migration Assistant or cloning I want to move all my data to a new SSD drive, and I want to create a workflow that does not use cloning or Time Machine.  The reasons why I do not want to clone my drive or to reinstate my data from Time Machine/Migration Assistant (TM/MA) is because both methods suffer from 'crud transfer'.  I have always used Time Machine to move my data to a new mac, but over the time I noticed that:\n\n\n*\n\n*TM/MA does not honour the install receipts, so I end up with quite a lot of stuff whose origin I do not remember, especially for obscure packages such as ZFS for OSX\n\n*a number of OS specific files are transferred as well.  I had a problem on ML due to a com.apple.whatever file that originated either in SL or L, and got passed on by reinstating my data from TM/MA.  Only problem was, this plist was (1) not playing nice in ML and (2) slowing Mail to a crawl.  I'd like to avoid this experience again.\n\n\nSo, is there a specific 'workflow' that will allow me to copy all my data to the new disk?  I can install ML on the new disk allright and copy all that is the old drive under /Users/me.  Is there more to do?   Any specific SNAFU in moving /Users/me/Library as a single block, especially between OS releases?  I will basically reinstall all my programs, but I find that less hassle than debugging obscure problems.\nBecause I am planning to do this for every OS upgrade (and I also need to move some data from a SL machine to a ML one) I will sum it up:\nis there a way of safely and completely moving all my data, and all my preferences and history to a new Mac with the same OS release, or a different OS release, without losing anything but avoiding carrying over obscure OS specific files that will cause obscure bugs in the future?\nAs I mentioned above, I found that TM/MA does not do the above (and loses installation info), and I disk cloning would not work for data transfers between OS releases. \n\nA: The answer is simply no, because no program will be able to know all the specifics of installed programs (MA probably comes closest to 'knowing' most of the specifics of Apple software but as you found, it did so for 99% only), much less drivers, **nix level installes (MacPorts, etc.). \nIf you have a well working copy, then clone the disk (SuperDuper, etc.) and then upgrade the new disk to the new operating system.\nIf you have trouble with your current installation, make a fresh install, then plug the old disk into an USB case and coppy the /Users/(you)/ folders.  This will avoid installed software , old drivers etc.  Then install the software you need (most of it will pick up the essential config data from /Users/you/Application Support/). \nThe first is quick and painless.  The 2nd usually is still quicker than you mostly think and gives you the nice good feeling of a fresh start :-)\n", "Q: Restoring my iPhone - will I get my content back? I have to restore as new so I can turn off the restrictions code and then be able to delete apps. Will I be able to get my contacts, music back etc?\n\nA: Yes. If your iPhone was ever connected to iTunes, or synched with iCloud, it was backed up.\nTo get your music back, it needs to be on iTunes. Same story for all of your apps.\nYour contacts, messages and notes are all backed up in iTunes or iCloud.\nWhen you've restored your iPhone, make sure that you choose the option to restore from a backup.\n\nA: If you backed it up, yes.

I have an iso containing Windows 7 that was given to me by a friend. He said I could just put it on a flash drive and install Windows 7 with Bootcamp, but I don't know how to do that the right way.\nHow do I load the iso onto the flash drive and use that for Bootcamp?\n\nA: Valid ISO images are explicitly supported by Apple in the latest Bootcamp software, so you should be good to go by following this guide and setting up Bootcamp to install Windows 7 in a separate partition on your main mac volume.\n\n\n*\n\n*http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5634 - Boot Camp: System requirements for Microsoft Windows operating systems\n\nA: This article entitled \"How To Easily Install Windows 7 & 8 onto An External USB Storage with PWBoot\" published on the 27th May 2013 by K.Chen for nextofwindows.com maybe helpful and provides step by step instructions (which should be followed very carefully).\nPWBoot (Portable Windows Boot) aims to simplify the process of making Windows Operating System to boot from any USB storage devices.\n", "Q: Can Windows 7 on Bootcamp cause problems? If I install Windows 7 on my Macbook Pro using Bootcamp, can Windows cause problems on the OS X partition? Can it overwrite OS X system files or corrupt my data? My main concern is that I need to use Windows 7 for some school and work related things throughout the year, but I want to keep OS X clean and healthy throughout the process.\n\nA: Bootcamp will create a separate partition for the Windows installation. This NTFS-formatted Windows partition is completely separate from the OS X partition.\nMoreover, you can always delete the Windows partition and return your HDD to its original state.\nIn other words, Bootcamp should be pretty safe and won't touch your Mac installation nor should it touch your files on the Mac partition.\n", "Q: Textmate 2 and Latex How can I set the main file in Textmate 2 in order to make it compile my complete dissertation and not the file I am editing?\n\nA: You need to tell your Latex editor where the main file of your dissertation is placed, in regard to the document you are editing. To define it, add this command to the header of the .tex file that you are editing: \n%!TEX root = ../Main.tex\n\nJust edit the path to your main file (in this example \"../Main.tex\") from the file you are editing. I usually have a file \"main.tex\" as master document and I link the chapters or sections of the document which are placed in sub-folder. \nTo try it out, open the menu Bundles -> Latex -> Project Management -> Open Master File\nWith this line in the head the main.tex file will open. Then you can compile it directly from the included .tex file with Bundles -> Latex -> Typeset and View \n\nA: To set the master file on a project basis, put\nTM_LATEX_MASTER = \"/path/to/main.tex\"\n\nin a file called .tm_properties in your project root.\n\nAs an alternative, have a look at the Subfiles and Standalone packages.\n\nA: Alternatively to the above suggested way, you could set a TextMate Variable that should be called TM_LATEX_MASTER and point it to your main latex document (copy the path into the variable value field next to the variable name).\nThe place where you can set TextMate's variables is under TextMate's Preferences (cmd+,) and go to the \"Variables\" section. \n", "Q: Using a apple tv box as a second monitor to your osx machine I've heard that you can use as ipad as a second monitor to you macbook by using software like iDisplay.\nIs it possible to use apple TV in a similar capacity?\nIf so then:\na.

You'll have to wait a few more months.\n\nA: This isn't something as easily accomplished since for iOS to act as a second display, an App provides that functionality. Since you cannot add apps easily to an Apple TV, you are constrained to mirroring the display, not extending it from OS X.\n\nA: It's not possible at the current moment.

I want to connect these three displays to my MacBook Pro with Retina display. Is there any way I can do that?\nThe office also has other iMacs and Cinema Displays of varying ages and technologies available for use. If there is no possibility of making my current setup work, is there any conceivable configuration that would make three displays possible?\n\nA: The Retina MacBook Pro (13 and 15) both allow for two external monitors using either both Thunderbolt Ports (and correct adapters) or two external monitors (one using HDMI to correct adapter and the other Thunderbolt to adapter).\nIn both cases, three displays work - the retina display and two external monitors. To add a third display, you'll need a USB display card (there are many and some are cheaper than $30 with performance to match the price) or a software solution to drive the iMac over VNC or similar networked protocol.\nOut of the box, the Retina MacBook Pro are not designed to run three external displays so you'll need something extra to make things work.\n\n\n*\n\n*http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5219#dispnum\nSee note 4 in the above article for RMBP details.\n", "Q: How do I stop/freeze my secondary display?

The \"without a file extension\" makes things interesting since unless the file is typed, quicklook (and the spotlight importer responsible for determining what type of file each one actually is) has less context to decide how to classify a blank README file.\nHave a look at the qlcolorcode plug in for colored syntax quick look and QLStephen for README and other ASCII plain text files.\n", "Q: Deleted iCloud contacts keep coming back Tried to delete several contacts on iCloud.com, but they keep coming back! I have tried several times with no success.\nThese contacts are still on my device with iCloud sync enabled.\nIf I don't want to disable iCloud sync do I have to remove these contacts on the devices as well?\n\nA: I had the same issue before. After some experiment, here is what I have found working:\nGo to Setting > Mail,Contacts,Calendars > Fetch New Data > iCloud > Select \"Push\" (if you select \"Fetch\", the iPhone changes will supersede changes made on iCloud. It is up to individual preference)\nAfter \"Push\" is selected, you may make all the changes you want to iCloud Contacts. Your iPhone will be updated in the next Sync.\nHope it works.\n\nA: iCloud is a way to keep the same data accessible via all your Apple devices.\nIt isn't set-up to allow you to keep different data on different devices.  If it were, then what would be the point of the service?\nThey're appearing in iCloud repeatedly because you have sync turned on.\nHowever, you can disable just the syncing of contacts by going to Settings -> iCloud -> Switch Contacts to OFF.\nHope this helps!\n\nA: These contacts are most probably stored not only in iCloud, but also on your device separately, in the device-only contact group called \"on my iPhone\".\nYour situation is probably a remnant of the times when you synced the contacts via iTunes. Then they got migrated to iCloud and were effectively doubled, but you only saw one contact in the Contacts app, because your iPhone (or iPad) displayed only one entry when contacts were doubled like that.\nWhat you need to do is go to the Contacts app, touch \"groups\" and turn off the iCloud group(s), but leave the group \"on my iPhone\". Then you will be able to ultimately delete the contacts that were there.\n\nA: Have you tried to set your (possible) iPhone / iPad / iPod Touch onto airplane mode, and then doing the change from the http://icloud.com with your log-in, deleting specific contacts, then waiting for a couple of minutes and bringing the devices back from airplane mode and then checking what the status is in them and on the iCloud?\n", "Q: Block Ads via AirPort Is there any way to block ads via an Apple Airport? I'd rather block all ads that way so that I can block ads on my iDevices.\n\nA: You can set the Airport base station's DNS to a service such as OpenDNS.

But its free.\n", "Q: Connect LED Cinema Display (Mini DP) via HDMI Is there any way I can connect an LED Cinema Display via the HDMI port on my MacBook Pro with Retina display? I know there are various dongles that adapt for HDMI cables from Mini DP, but if I were to plug such an adapter into the back end of a LED Cinema Display, and connect it to my rMBP via an HDMI cake, would that configuration work?\n\nA: You don't need to use an adaptor (supposedly) -- thunderbolt ports are the same as mini display ports, so according to Apple you do not need an adaptor, because it \"will work just like it was connecting to a Mini DisplayPort connector when plugging in directly to the Thunderbolt connector on your Apple computer.\"\nThat said, I am also trying to figure out how it works, because it doesn't for me currently.

When I create an event on the web app, it gets synced to the iPhone.\nUsing the iCloud calendar works fine both ways.\nWhat might be the problem? I've tried to disable the calendar syncing, and re-enabling it, but that did not help.\n\nA: It often takes a few minutes for the cloud to sync, that's normal.\nI'd suggest double checking your phone to ensure your push settings are all set the way they ought to be.

We are not interested in the apps like Netflix, etc, so we would like to avoid connecting the device via HDMI and thus keep it hidden.\n\nA: No, the Apple TV video output works solely via HDMI. Audio can also go via optical out. The Apple TV is an AirPlay receiver. What you are suggesting is an AirPlay transmitter, like the iPad and iPhone are, which send a video or audio stream to an AirPlay receiver, like the Apple TV. You won't get around to connecting the Apple TV to the actual display with HDMI. \nThe Apple TV itself is very small, so you should be able to mount it next to or behind the TV / display.

A lint free microfiber cloth and my AM screen cleaning fluid.\nHowever there must have been a small particle of something nasty either on the screen itself or on the cloth (I always keep the cloth stored away to prevent this exact issue!) the scratch that is left on the screen is admittedly tiny (~2mm) but it is there, it is bugging me and I would like to get it sorted if possible.\nI've been reading up on various methods that might help but nothing definitive.  \nToothpaste!\nThe toothpaste method that is often mentioned is unsuitable for the matte Retina display as others have reported that it left the area around where they applied the toothpaste with a glossy effect as toothpaste is actually very abrasive.\nPencil Eraser\nThis method I'm really not sure about on a rMBP screen.

I wouldn't be surprised if the surface was treated to reduce glare, but can't point to a public specification other than the glass is \"high quality\" and \"optically pure\" in the various marketing materials and product announcement videos.\nThe scratch itself likely is the beginnings of a fresnel lens and will distort the pixels behind it. You might be able to fill it with a substance designed to mimic the refractive index of glass - but my experience is that people do more harm than already exists when trying to polish and/or fill gaps in Apple's clear glass panels.\n\nA: I've just got back from my local Apple Store after making an appointment with them yesterday.

In Mountain Lion, Mac OS X can use its dictation/voice recognition to turn your speaking into text.\nSuppose I have an audio file of my voice speaking. Is there a way to use this dictation ability to turn that audio file into a text file?\nI suppose the brute force solution would be to plug headphones into the audio port and hold them up to the microphone. Is there a more software-based solution more analogous to Unix pipes?\n\nA: You can install Soundflower. It's a great utility that creates virtual input and output devices. So you could route QuickTime player, for example, as the input for the dictation.\nhttp://cycling74.com/soundflower-landing-page/\n\nA: On Mavericks, you can use the dictation on an audio file if you use Soundflower plus an audio player which allows you to choose the sound output device, such as Audacity. This way you won't be affected by Mavericks muting the system sound output during dictation, because the output will go into Soundflower before it gets muted, and you set the dictation to receive only from Soundflower. This also has the advantage of other sounds that may occur (such as a reminder notification sound) not causing interference. It will also work better than previous Mac OS X versions because the enhanced dictation in Mavericks (which needs to be enabled first) does not cut off the dictation after 30 seconds. \nThis webpage provides the details on how to use the Mac OS X 10.9 dictation on an audio file:\nhttp://www.leveluplunch.com/blog/2013/12/30/convert-recorded-audio-text-using-osx-dictation-audacity-soundflower/\n\nA: In Yosemite, Whenever we try to use the dictation feature in OSX it mutes other sounds and active only the build-in microfone. You need to set some hidden preferences to make this work. Open Terminal and enter the two commands below:\ndefaults write com.apple.SpeechRecognitionCore AllowAudioDucking -bool NO\n\ndefaults write com.apple.speech.recognition.AppleSpeechRecognition.prefs DictationIMAllowAudioDucking -bool NO\n\nAfter doing this turn off dictation in Systems Preferences, wait a few seconds and then re-enable it. You should now be able to dictate while audio is playing. I’ve only tried this while using a headset/headphones, it’s probably not advisable without. :)\nTo restore your system to it’s virginal state, run these commands in Terminal and then restart dictation:\ndefaults delete com.apple.SpeechRecognitionCore AllowAudioDucking\n\ndefaults delete com.apple.speech.recognition.AppleSpeechRecognition.prefs DictationIMAllowAudioDucking\n\n\nA: As of Catalina/Big Sur, the built-in Dictation feature will no longer accept audio from any virtual microphone or system outputted audio. Oddly it often seems to ignore the microphone selected in dictation preferences and just using a different one.\nBut there's a solution! Just use the Voice Control feature instead of the dictation feature. This happens all offline so the quality is somewhat worse and it's not as consistent as the Dictation feature. This post touches on that topic: https://machow2.com/dictate-offline-catalina/\nReading between the lines, it seems like Apple is trying to prevent their fancy cloud-based speech to text service from being use for automated transcription... Similar to how built in macOS text-to-speech functionality (say) refuses won't output using the high quality Siri voices.\n\nA: If you have Rogue Amoeba's Loopback software, you can create a 'virtual dictation' device and play back audio through it to the Dictation service.\nThey have a complete guide here, but here's the rundown:\n\n*\n\n*Launch Loopback and create a new 'Virtual Device' named something like Transcription.\n\n*Add your playback app as a source (e.g. Quicktime, Music, Podcasts, whatever).\n\n*In the Keyboard System Preference pane, under Dictation, select your new Transcription virtual device under the microphone as the audio source.\n\n*Open an app that supports dictation like TextEdit.\n\n*Start playing audio from the playback app\n\n*In TextEdit, click Edit > Start Dictation...\n\nI just tested on macOS Monterey and it seemed to work pretty well for my spoken word files.\n", "Q: Special Characters Suddenly Won't Insert I've frequently used Special Characters, accessed with Command ⌘+Option ⌥+T, and have been able to insert characters into text fields by double-clicking them. However, this has stopped working. I can still bring up the Special Characters window and navigate through it, but double-clicking an entry only adds it to the Recently Used section - it doesn't actually insert them into the focused text field. The window also seems to act as if it's not in focus, as the various UI elements inside the window are highlighted with grey rather than blue. Clicking inside the window does not focus it, and clicking on the title bar only focuses the title bar, and not the rest of the window, as can be seen below:\n\nDo any of you have an idea as to what might be the cause of this? As far as I'm aware I haven't changed anything between when it worked and when it stopped working.\n\nA: I had this exact same issue, and user Tom Gewecke's advice seems to have fixed it for me. I simply removed two plist files in ~/Library/Preferences, and then rebooted. The files were com.apple.CharacterPicker.plist and com.apple.CharacterPaletteIM.plist. I don't know which of those files had the issue, but after removing them and rebooting they've regenerated, and everything's good again.\n\nIf you're comfortable with Terminal\nYou probably know how to move files around, just move these two somewhere else, or rename them:\n\n\n*\n\n*~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.CharacterPaletteIM.plist\n\n*~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.CharacterPicker.plist\nIf you just want something you can copy and paste, here you go:\nmv ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.CharacterPaletteIM.plist{,-backup}\nmv ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.CharacterPicker.plist{,-backup}\n\nReboot after this, and fingers crossed, it will work for you again.\nIf you're not so comfortable with Terminal\nOpen up a Finder window and press Shift ⌘ G (Shift Command G), then type ~/Library/Preferences/, and press Enter. There will be many files in that folder, you're looking for the ones called com.apple.CharacterPaletteIM.plist and com.apple.CharacterPicker.plist. When you find them, you can probably just remove them, but it's always a good idea to back them up. Just move them to another folder or something. \nWhen you've done that, reboot your computer, and see if the Special Characters window works again.\n\nA: Are you opening /System/Library/Input Methods/CharacterPalette.app/ directly? If it is opened directly, double-clicking doesn't seem to insert characters.\nIn any case, you could try running killall CharacterPalette or opening the character viewer from the input menu instead of the menu bars of applications.\nCharacters can also be inserted with drag and drop or by selecting Copy Character Info.\nIt's normal that the whole window appears gray, because it isn't a key window. And it's normal that the background of selections is gray instead of blue, possibly to indicate that the views don't support keyboard navigation or multiple selections.\n", "Q: Where are the PNG files for the UI theme stored?

Is there a way to establish rules for mails processed on the iPhone (4s, iOS 6.1.3)?\nIn my case, I am interested in automatically forwarding certain emails to another email account once I receive them.  \n\nA: At first glance it isn't possible in a stock installation of iOS 6 and using the default mail app. If you jailbreak your phone, it appears that at least one tweak, Mail Enhancer Pro, will allow you to have rules on your iPhone itself.\nHowever, there are a number of good options, other then jailbreaking, that may work.\nFirst, if you use an IMAP email account, then you may be able to use your computer to route the mail. The changes will obviously reflect on the device. For example, if you have a Mac, then you can use Mail.app to create a rule to forward particular emails to the address you desire.\nSecond, depending on who provides your email, you may be able to route the mail there. I would say Gmail is an example of that. If you go to your Gmail account and navigate to settings, you can set up rules in there.\niCloud mail provides rules as well. If you go to www.iCloud.com -> Mail -> Settings (icon in the upper left corner). You can select the Rules tab and set up actions that would work apply to the mail you receive to your @me.com, @icloud.com, or @mac.com account.\n", "Q: Transfer movie using itunes I am trying to follow the simple instructions given at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAI2V5q-4Bs to transfer a movie from my laptop to my ipad.

The reason here is that standard and error output are sent via two different channels (and only visually combined afterwards by the shell). If you pipe the output into another command only the content of standard output will be inputed into the next command.\n", "Q: Prevent double click on application focus When I click on an application in OSX, this focuses the application and raises it to the front, but does not pass the click through to the application. However, I frequently wish to focus an application to perform an action, and my Windows/Linux training has taught me to click where I want my click to register. In OSX, this becomes a problem because I click once to focus and a second time to trigger a click event - but the window responds as though to a double click - when toggling something with a click, the window focus click is only treated as a click when I send another, toggling the object twice.\nWhat setting(s) should I change to support either passing that first click like other popular WIMP GUIs or to consume that first click completely and use it only for focusing the window? If not settings, are there software that solve this problem?\n\nA: Pending a better answer - in Cocoa applications on OSX I can force a \"click through\" to the lower window without focusing it by ⌘-clicking. This appears to be a good solution - just needs to be more discoverable.\n", "Q: 2010 2.66 GHz 12 core Mac Pro not utilizing all 24 threads? I just recently purchased a 2010 Mac Pro.\n \nI am wondering why all 24 threads never go past 50% usage when doing CPU intensive tasks.\nMy coworker has a 2009 2.93 GHz 8 core Mac Pro and we both tried converting a dvd with Handbrake, and in activity monitor on the 2009 Mac Pro all 8 cores/16 threads were close to 100% usage but on the 2010 Mac Pro all 12 cores/24 threads never went passed 55% usage.\nWe are running Mountain Lion on both Mac Pro's\n\nA: It could be as simple as the application you used to test had a resource constraint other than CPU that prevented it from saturating the CPUs. For example, perhaps handbrake was limited in how quickly it could stream data to or from disk. That would limit how much work the CPUs could be given to do. Given that your CPUs will be faster and more plentiful than the older Mac, it isn't a surprised to not saturate the CPUs with the same workload.\nI/O contention is used as an example. Without analysis, I don't know what would prevent the CPUs from being the bottleneck. It could be synchronization between that many threads, I/O, a lack of work that can be done in parallel, etc.\nHere is a quick test you can use to give the system independent tasks. Open terminal and run the following command. Change the 8 to double the number of CPU cores you have. (double to allow for hyper threading)\nfor ((g=1;g<=8;g++)); do ( dd if=/dev/zero bs=100m count=10 | bzip2 -c > /dev/null & ); done\n\nRunning that was enough to keep my CPU busy for 10-15 seconds. I have a quad core i7 macbook pro. Your CPUs may need more work, so you can change \"count=10\" to some larger number as well.\n", "Q: In-App Purchases - How can I know who did the charge-back? App purchases and in-app purchases can be cancelled with charge-back if you send a message to iTunes Store Support within a time frame of a few days and provide them a good reason.\nI'd like to know if is possible to know what Apple-ID or User did the charge-back. \nTake the following behavior of an User. (you in this case means the app developer):\n\n\n*\n\n*User makes a $99 in-app purchase and receive YYY 'Gold Coins';\n\n*User buys in-app stuff using the 'Gold Coins' (Potion, cards, whatever);\n\n*User receives the items and requests a charge-back;\n\n*Apple accepts the request and gives user the $99 back;\n\n*Apple informs you that you received a charge-back, but does not specify anything related to user like device's UDID, account or anything;\n\n*Without user info, you can't remove the in-game items user got through the purchased coins;\n\n*User shares this behavior with other users;\n\n*Everyone does the same;\n\n\nWhat will happen? Game/app 'economy' becomes hell and you get nothing.\nSo, is there any secret way (or a not so simple to notice option that I've missed somewhere) on iTunes Connect that allows you to know WHO did that so you can act properly by removing the items/cash/whatever (or even temp/perma ban if the behavior continues)?\n\nA: You are not privy to customer details from any of Apple's App stores unless you are selling a subscription and the user opts in to sharing data.\nOther than requiring the users to make an account to play and working within Apple's UUID / temporary device ID framework, you have no realistic way to determine who is spending money or who is asking Apple for a refund.\nHave your lawyer (or you if you're the business person responsible for agreements) look over the terms and conditions that explain when you do and do not get customer data.\nBarring that, you can always open a support ticket with developer support since you are a paid developer to ask them to look into any patterns of unusual sales for your specific application.

I've had failed hard drives before, and this doesn't seem like a failure because the hard drive is working quietly (there's no clicking noise at all even during the freezes) and I get a verified SMART status in Disk Utility. Are there any alternative theories to the kernel disk0s2: I/O Error in console or is it definitely an impending hard drive failure? Could it be due to overheating? WD drives get really hot. Any theories?\n\nA: That is definitely the sign of some failure related to your HDD. The SMART status is not real helpful in many cases either; for instance if you have bad blocks it probably won't detect them. \nMy recommendations would be back-up everything, then reformat the drive and see if the problem persists - or send it back to WD, since your HDD should be covered under warranty. \n", "Q: Is it possible to create a new 8gig partition as installer in lion is it possible to create, let's say 8gig partition in your HD and create an installer just like having it created in usb to dvd, so that I can do a clean re install Mac OS Lion?\n\nA: You can do a clean reinstall from the recovery partition without needing any external media:\n\n\n*\n\n*Hold command-R on startup\n\n*Erase the Macintosh HD volume from Disk Utility\n\n*Choose Reinstall OS X\n\n\nIf you don't erase the OS X volume first, Reinstall OS X does an upgrade install.\nSee OS X Lion: Erase and reinstall Mac OS X.\n\"Startup disk\" probably means the main OS X volume (like Macintosh HD) here:\n\nSelect your startup disk from the list on the left, and then click the Erase tab.\n\nIf you erase the whole drive, it also erases the recovery partition and EFI partition, and your Mac will try to start up in internet recovery mode when it is restarted.\n", "Q: Can I gather the associated email address from an iMessage that was sent from a phone number? Imagine this:\nI exchanged my phone number with a nice lady on the street. I have iMessage activated, so does she (when I text her, I see the \"iMessage\" text).\nAn hour later she sends me an email. The email I used as an username when I activated my phone.\nQuestions:\n\n\n*\n\n*How did she extract my email from my phone?\n\n*Is there a service that I can use to extract email from a phone?\n\n*Why can't I extract her email?\n\n\nBTW, googling the subject gave me nothing - not even another person asking the same question.\n\nA: I see the mostly likely cause of this being the possibility that your default sending address is set to your email address. I say this because it appears that you initiated the conversation.\nYou can check (and change) this by going to Settings.app -> Messages -> Send & Receive. Under \"Start new conversations from:\", observe whether your email address or phone number is selected.\nIf your email address is selected, this would be an easy explanation as to why this happened.\nOtherwise, as far as I know, (and I have just went over this to verify), it is impossible to extract the email address that is associated with an iMessage phone number from just a regular iMessage \"text\".\n", "Q: Client certificate required after installing certificate Using safari on OS X 10.8.2 to connect to an internal server via https:, safari indicates a client certificate is required.  Tried dragging the certificate from the url field to the desktop and adding it to the system keychain which did not work.  Went to the server and exported the certificate then added it to the system keychain which did not work as well.\nWhat could be the problem?  The server is a windows machine running IIS.\nAny suggestions to try something else?\n\nA: You are looking for a client certificate.  It would seem if you are trying to obtain it from the URL that you are actually getting the server certificate to place in your keychain.\nNormally a client certificate is a certificate that identifies the user, or at times the machine, that the request is coming from (ie. not the server you are accessing via Safari).\nA client certificate would normally reside in your Login keychain and not the system keychain as it identifies you.\nThe client certificate is normally provided from the server by some other means rather than accessing the browser, as that is an insecure delivery method.\nYou need to talk to the owner of the internal server and ask them to provide a client certificate, or if two-way certificate identification is not required then have it turned off in the internal server instead.\n", "Q: Can I get service for my Windows PC iTunes at a Genius Bar? I have a general question to ask.\nIf I have iTunes running on my Windows PC, and something was wrong, could I bring it into the Apple Store's Genius bar for them to service it?\nDo they service Apple software outside of Apple hardware?\n\nA: Apple retail stores support iTunes on PC. The depth of troubleshooting is typically deleting iTunes and associated applications from PC and re-downloading iTunes. That said many people have received great how-to info regarding iTunes on PC or Mac in Apple retail stores\n\nA: I went to the Apple store and asked my questions. \nThey do offer some service for iTunes on a PC. They just won't go beyond anything iTunes-- example the registry or other driver issues. So if it's very much a PC issue, they don't address those. I would think it would be similar to their web browser Safari.\nAs for service for Apple software on non-Apple hardware, say Mac OS X on an hackintosh, they will not service.\n", "Q: Will I still have a geo-tag if I take a screenshot on my computer? I am sure the answer is no but I am always a bit more investigative.  \nLet's say I took an picture with my iPhone 5 and the image has geo tags.  I email it to myself and then I take a screenshot my using the Preview tool.  Will I still have geo-tag information on that image or since I took a snapshot only on my Mac, it won't have it?\n\nA: It sounds like you're talking about taking a screenshot on your Mac of the iPhone image, in which case, no, it won't have any geo-tagging information embedded.\nHowever if you want to remove geo-tags from any photos (screenshots included) that you do have, the more convenient way is probably to use a tool like ImageOptim to strip out the EXIF data (which is the metadata containing geolocation data, amongst other things). That way you preserve the quality of the original, and you don't need to bother exactly trimming the size of the screenshot you take to the photo.\n\nA: Seems that Preview.app can show you if a GPS tag is present or not.\nIn Preview.app, open the inspector window (using Tools > Show Inspector) and select the \"More Info\" tab (with the \"i\" icon).  If you see a GPS tab (within the More Info tab), along with General, Exif and so on, then the image has a GPS tag.\nI'm not absolutely sure that this feature of Preview is a reliable way of determining the absence of a GPS tag.  So: an alternative I've also used is jhead.  This is a command line tool which can also show any GPS tags present in an image.\n", "Q: Is there a keyboard shortcut to navigate full screen windows of the same application? Or is there some app that will let me do it. This bug has been forever since Lion. Isn't it about time apple fixed it?\n\nA: Witch also includes full screen windows, and ⌥⇥ selects the next window from the current application by default.\nOr if you use an application that has its own implementation for full screen windows (like WriteRoom), ⌘` usually includes custom full screen windows.\n\nA: Try Contexts for Mac. I replaced the built-in apps switcher with this utility which lets me to view full screen windows including a feature to search active windows by title.\n\nA: You mean something like ⌘-tab, but restricted to windows of the same application?  I indeed installed Witch in the past for the ⌥-tab option, but don't use it anymore, either.\n\n\n*\n\n*I am using fullscreen windows a lot, but I am just using ⌘-tab and Ctrl-left/right for navigating between spaces.\n\n*Maybe using tabs within the same full-screen window is another possible workaround (depending on the application)?

We are planning to develop an iOS app using PhoneGap, so we have also purchased $99 Developer license for it. So far we are good, but as per my research I found that we cannot build iOS app on windows, we compulsory need mac for it.\nMy question, is it necessary to use mac even if we don't have intend to submit to app store currently? Just we need to test our app on iPad so that once we have bug free application we can purchase mac and build release version out of it before we submit to app store.\nIs this possible? Since we are a Java shop and this is our first project for iOS, please excuse me if I am asking something obvious.\n\nA: So the bad news is that XCode is needed for its iOS Simulator as well as its Application Loader facility for actually uploading the programs to iOS devices for \"real\" testing. You'll need XCode for signing your apps before submitting to the App Store. Unfortunately, XCode is only available for OS X.\nHowever, the good news is that you may be able to purchase OS X and run it in a virtual machine such as VMWare Workstation. I don't know how straightforward this is, as it is rather difficult to get OS X to run on non-Apple hardware, but a quick Google search shows that it is possible. This method would (likely) be cheaper than purchasing a new Mac, although the Mac Mini retails in the US for only $599. Some posts I've seen indicate that this may or may not be legal, others say you need OS X Server for virtualization. I'll leave the research up to you.\nThere are also services such as MacInCloud that allow you to rent a Mac server that you can access from Windows via remote desktop, or through your browser. Unfortunately, I don't think you'd be able to use Application Loader, as you have to physically connect the device to your computer, but it would work for development and simulation, at least.\nGood luck!\n\nA: Run on PhoneGap on a PC until you hit a roadblock.\nYou can always post here on whatever specific roadblock you hit, but as the iOS toolchain has matured, you don't necessarily need Xcode to make an app anymore.\n\n\n*\n\n*RubyMotion (non Xcode solution, but still requires a Mac OS)\n\n*WebApp frameworks\n\n*PhoneGap and other frameworks\nSo, you have dozens of tools to start and once your delay to development costs you more than the $250 it might cost to pick up a used Mac - you can decide to buy tools that make your development move faster or cost less due to quality or other costs to development that better tools will reduce for you over time.\n\nA: It is possible to run OS X in VMWare Player on Windows 7 - I have seen it done and used it this way.  However, the biggest drawback is performance - and it took two people a few days to get it working correctly.  My suggestion would be to skip the Windows 7 platform and go directly with a MAC since your plans include that anyway.\n\nA: You can use Smartface for iOS development on Windows; in any of the development step it does not require any Mac or Objective-C knowledge.\nOnly at when submitting to AppStore Mac and Developer program subscription is required.\n", "Q: kernel_task is using 90% CPU, what could be the cause?

I read somewhere that I should try safe boot and see the effect but there is none.\nAny ideas as to what is causing it?\nThanks\n\nA: It might actually be spotlight trying to index your drive. \n\nA: I found a way to fix this issue, thought I should post it since it might help someone else. Granted this fix kinda worked for me since my fans are at their full rpm but you should read the explanation first and then choose to follow the steps yourself, anyways the info. is here: http://www.rdoxenham.com/?p=259 \n", "Q: The safest, most reliable way to move files from drive A to drive B I am trying to come up with the safest way to move data between two drives, designed to handle the worst possible circumstances. For example: if you were trying to move the only existing copies of pictures of your child being born while a crazed monkey was roaming the halls and might pull the power cord on your Mac and/or the external drives at any moment.\nNote that there is a similar question for syncing, but I'm asking specifically about moving which is a different problem, because (amongst other reasons) you have to be able to tell which files have been moved and which have not. You also need to account for the possibility that some files might have been copied to the intended destination but not removed from the source.\nThis solution does not have to use the GUI. In fact I find the Terminal comforting. I don't mind installing new programs (especially if available via brew). Only requirement is that the solution be compatible with Mac OS X 10.8. \nHere is the work-flow solution that I have in mind:\n\n\n*\n\n*cp (copy) files (if needed)\n\n*checksum files (either after copy or if an existing copy of the file is found)\n\n*Move original file to trash (not rm!) after a file has been moved to new location\n\n\nMore specifically:\n\n\n*\n\n*User specifies where files should be moved to (target/destination folder). Call it $DEST (This would be similar to the --target-directory flag to GNU mv\n\n*User specifies files/folders which should be moved to $DEST. Call that $INPUT\n\n*Script would then look for each file/folder from $INPUT on $DEST.\n\n*If file/folder is found on $DEST then checksum it against $INPUT copy.\n\n*If checksum matches, move $INPUT copy to trash.\n\n*If checksum does not match, replace $DEST copy with $INPUT\nNote: while I do care about permissions (technically I care about \"executability\"), I do not care about \"ownership\" as I am the only user of this local system.\nBefore I go and re-invent the wheel, does something like this already exist?\nBasically I want as much assurance as possible that a good copy has been made before I delete the original, without doing a full sync between the two drives.\n\nA: I'd use the same solution as for syncing, with the option given to rsync to remove the source files. Something like this:\nrsync -azv --remove-source-files $INPUT $DEST\n\nAs you mentioned, why reinvent the wheel? rsync checksums each transferred file to be sure it has transferred correctly.\n", "Q: Sharing Google Calendar with wife so she can see it on iPhone So I have two calendars that I share with my wife. One is normal (which she can see all details for) and the other (my counseling calendar) is for my therapy client schedule. I want her to be able to see when I'm busy but no details, as I put the client's name so I know who I'm going to be counseling at the appointed time. I set the share settings to public but so it wouldn't show details (only free/busy time). And when she logs into her Google calendar on a computer, it shows up correctly, i.e. it only shows the appointments for me as being \"busy.\" \nSo the main issue is this: I cannot get her iPhone to be able to show my counseling calendar. When she goes to the Google Sync page on her iPhone where you can choose which calendars you want your iPhone to sync with, my counseling calendar will not show up. It will only show up if I give her rights to see details... which is unacceptable because of patient confidentiality, etc. \nHas anyone heard of this problem or have any ideas??\n\nA: The iOs Calendar client doesn't support availability-only calendars, that's why they are not listed on the Google Sync settings page.\nSorry!\n", "Q: Installing windows on late 2009 iMac 27\" I've sucessfully installed Win 7 x64 twice on my imac before.

BAM! No Windows anymore!\nWhat happened??\nBasically whatever normal operation you did before in creating a new\n  partition has resulted in the MBR (Master Boot Record, which handles\n  Windows booting) being corrupted. So how do you fix something related\n  to PC when you're on a Mac?\nBefore you start: First, make sure you can boot properly into Mac OS\n  X. In Mac OS X, in System Preferences, select Startup Disks option.\n  Choose your Mac OS X drive as the startup drive. You can press the\n  restart button to test and see that the setting is saved. Second,\n  uninstall rEFIt if you have it installed as it overrides Single User\n  mode which is required for this fix. Third, if you have TUXERA NTFS-3G\n  installed, disable it. Once you have disabled it, unmount and then\n  remount your Boot Camp partition. This is so that the Boot Camp\n  partition loads with Apple's native drivers rather than Tuxera's weird\n  drivers (which are only useful within Mac OS X).

I've read many things about connecting an external graphic card via USB, PCIe, Thunderbolt, etc... but I'm not a Mac hardware expert and I don't see anything that could work with no doubt on my Mac.\nCan you help ?\n\nA: With a Mac Mini that old, you are out of luck if you want anything better than the built-in HDMI.  However, there are USB-to-DVI converters, also known as external graphics cards, that will work fine to connect a second display.  I have had good results with this one.  Two 1920x1080 monitors are a lot better than one!\nNewer Minis (the 2008 Core 2 Duo model with GeForce graphics, and later) have two video ports, one of which is a DisplayPort connector which with the right adapters can run a 30\" monitor at 2560x1600.\n", "Q: Maintaining 1:1 rendering on high res screen (Snow Leopard) I hace A Dell U2713HM screen that is 2560x1440 capable, but my Mac Mini is only 1920x1080 capable.

How do I transfer my contacts from iPhone to Gmail ? I am not sure which is the correct site to ask this question, because it is a non-technical question. Can anyone guide me please?\n\nA: There are a few ways to do this, but the primary way is actually built into iOS. I gathered the information from this link where there is a good comprehensive run down of all the details in setting up a Gmail account and getting the syncing going.\nSet up Gmail using the Exchange trick so that contact syncing will continue in the future:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Open the Settings application on your device's home screen.\n  \n*Open Mail, Contacts, Calendars.\n  \n*Press Add Account....\n  \n*Select Microsoft Exchange\n  \n*In the Email field, enter your full Google Account email address.\n  \n*Enter your Google Account password as the Password.\n  \n*Press Next at the top of your screen.\n  \n*Enter m.google.com in the Server field.\n  \n*Leave the Domain field blank.\n  \n*Enter the user email address as the Username.\n  \n*Press Next at the top of your screen again.\n  \n*Select the Google services (Mail, Calendar, and Contacts) you want to sync.\n  \n\nAnd then to transfer your contacts to Google it looks like you will need to transfer your current contacts to iTunes:\n\nIf you have all your contacts on your device and want to import them into Google, you can synchronize your Google Contacts with iTunes. All Contacts and Calendars that you sync with iTunes will be put into the On My iPhone Contacts and Calendar groups on your phone. iOS currently doesn't allow you to move Contacts or Calendar events from the On My iPhone groups to the Google Sync groups.\n\nNote that you will have to turn off iCloud contacts sync if you sync with iTunes.

Every piece of software on my Mac honored my /etc/hosts file entry when my hosts file was symlinked (aliased) to another file, except Safari.

To do that, I have a complete copy of each site running on my local network.  When I wish to work locally, I have always just added an entry for \"example.com\" to my local /etc/hosts file, and that has always overridden DNS, making it possible for me to access the local copy of the website in any browser, including Safari and Firefox.  I can work without affecting the actual live site, then upload changes when they're complete.\nRecently, however, this technique stopped working for both Safari and Firefox, but not for Chrome, so for a while I was limited to using Chrome for local development.  I searched google and tried all the suggested fixes -- CR at the end of the hosts file, only one entry per line, various Firefox configuration changes using \"about:config\", etc.  Nothing worked.\nThen I tried this simple thing:  in addition to putting the IPV4 version of the address in the /etc/hosts file, I also put the IPV6 version.\nBefore:\n10.0.1.23       example.com\n\nAfter:\n10.0.1.23       example.com\n0:0:0:0:0:FFFF:0A00:0117        example.com\n\nAs soon as I added the IPV6 entry, both Firefox and Safari started hitting the correct (local) server.\nThere are various websites that will translate IPV4 addresses to IPV6; just do a google search on \"ipv4 to ipv6\".\n\nA: In some cases, loopback addresses need to be added for both IPv4 and IPv6 in the /etc/hosts file.\nSay we already added a blocking entry for the IPv4 address of website.com:\n127.0.0.1 website.com\n\nIf dscacheutil -q host -a name website.com returns addresses for both protocol versions:\nname: website.com\nipv6_address: rand:omin:vali:dipv:6addr:ess5\n\nname: website.com\nip_address: 127.0.0.1\n\nthen we need to add another line into the hosts file:\n::1 website.com\n\n\nA: I spent quite some time on OS X El Captain 10.11.4 to block sites using /etc/hosts file instead of using Parental Control in System preferences. At the end it simply  worked like this:\n127.0.0.1 www.website.com\n127.0.0.1 website.com\n\nI tried a lot of variants, but I was always mapping to 0.0.0.0 (0.0.0.0 website.com). That never worked in any variation.\nUnlike some suggestions on the web, these were useless:\n\n\n*\n\n*There was no need for IPv6 blocking like fe80::1%lo0 www.website.com or ::1 website.com\n\n*There was no need for dscacheutil -flushcache, but just do it in case.\n\n*It does not matter if you paste it at the beginning or end of the hosts file\n\n*Browsers seem to have been responded differently: Chrome and Safari blocked it immediately once the correct hosts file was saved, Firefox kept ignoring it for a while (not clear if restarting it was enough).\n\n\n*\n\n*Try to use New Private Window or restart the browser for testing it. \n\n\n*Do not add http:// or https:// at the beginning of the address\n\n*No other commands were necessary.\n\n*Do not disable (= comment out by adding a # at the beginning) lines that are in the hosts file already.\n\n\nUseful checks\n\n\n*\n\n*Check if the system recognizes your redirection dscacheutil -q host -a name website.com -  it should display:\nname: website.com\nip_address: 127.0.0.1\n\n\n*Check if the syntax of the hosts file is correct by: cat -vet /etc/hosts. This shows invisible characters:\n\n\n*\n\n*Lines should end with $\n\n*Between 127.0.0.1 and website.com should be only a space or a tab, which is displayed as ^I.\n\n\n*Note that for some sites, like facebook for instance, you might need to block a lot of addresses.\n\n*I think that the hosts file should end with a newline.\n\n\nA: I had wrong line ending. It has to have LF, I had CR.\n\nA: I had this problem too but the solution is really easy\nLet's suppose you create an Alias in the host file to your machine with the name localhost2\nThat entry in the host file should look like this:\n127.0.0.1       localhost2\nWhen you type \"localhost2\" in the safari url bar you will notice in the dropdown that the default option is to search that in google, you should select the option saying \"Go to Site localhost2\"\n\nA: Make sure your /etc/hosts has exactly these attributes. I was copying, modifying and replacing the file using my own userid, every other program kept working except safari...\n$ ls -l /etc/hosts\n-rw-r--r--  1 root  wheel  1004 Sep 24 16:03 /etc/hosts\n\n\nA: For an https address example.com, I had to include both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses for both example.com and www.example.com before it worked. Like this:  \n##\n# Host Database\n#\n# localhost is used to configure the loopback interface\n# when the system is booting.  Do not change this entry.\n##\n127.0.0.1       localhost\n127.0.0.1       example.com\n::1     example.com\n127.0.0.1       www.example.com\n::1     www.example.com\n255.255.255.255 broadcasthost\n::1             localhost\n\n\nA: According to this blog http://thecoredump.org/2011/09/editing-the-hosts-file-in-mac-os-x-lion/\nYou have to put the entry at the start of the host file.

Sometimes I've got a Bluetooth keyboard with me, and sometimes I don't. So this may be crazy, but I would like to use my iPad for full-fledged web development and programming, and want I to know what my options are.\nCloud9 seems to be nearly perfect for this in concept except for a fatal flaw: the web interface does not fully work with iPad browsers Safari or Chrome. You cannot, for example, double click to open files.\nWhat other options do I have? Ideally I would like to have command line access to my editor of choice (Vim), and be able to use web debugging tools like the developer tools in Chrome.\n\nA: I was all ready to call you mad, but this is looking considerably more workable than I'd have thought.\nThere is an iOS port of Vim, and if that doesn't work well then you can always use one of many terminal emulators to shell into a remote host and run Vim there. I might recommend the latter ahead of the former, actually; it's not clear how you're expected to get files onto the device for editing and then put them back into their testing environment, whereas running Vim directly on the testing host obviates the concern entirely. Multitasking is a concern here, in that if the emulator doesn't get any CPU time then your connection will time out, but judicious use of GNU Screen, and perhaps an emulator such as Prompt which can maintain connections for a while even when backgrounded, should relieve that problem pretty handily.\nAs for debugging tools, the ones built into Safari only work when your device is tethered to a computer running the desktop version, but Firebug Lite is said to work in iOS Safari and presumably would work just as well in iOS Chrome, and its bookmarklet can be added to the browser's bookmarks bar for easy access. (It doesn't seem to be working right now in any of the three browsers in which I've tried it, including Safari on my iPhone, but I suspect that's a transient issue related to the apparently quite recent release of a new version with major changes.)\nBeing similarly equipped with an iPad and Bluetooth keyboard, I'd considered trying the same thing you're looking to do, but wrote it off as unworkable. Thanks for giving me the impetus to investigate further and discover that it can very likely be done pretty well after all.\n\nA: Mark O'Connor has written a compelling series of articles (starting with this one) about doing web development using an iPad as a thin client to a Linux remote server. \nYou basically just need an SSH client app for the iPad (there are several: Mark mentions iSSH), and you have access to VIM or whatever other tools you can run on the server.\n\nA: I use two apps for coding on my iPad, though I only use them in emergency situations.\nThe first is iSSH. It lets you log on via SSH to servers. It also does X forwarding, so I can log in to my workstation in the office if need be.\nThe second is  Koder, which is basically a mini IDE for an iPad. It supports FTP, (S)FTP, Dropbox, WebDAV, and local development. Also, it has Firebug built in to it :)\nI'm not sure I'd like to use it 100% of the time (Zend Studio on Xubuntu works very well for me) but it is workable.\n\nA: Doing development on an iPad is definitely possible, but how well it works for you will depend a lot on your workflow. In particular, you may run into trouble when it comes to debugging, especially if you need a good JavaScript debugger.\nDebugging\nAs an experiment I recently tried some editing of a (mostly JavaScript) webapp I've been working on using my iPad. The editing went relatively smoothly (I used Textastic), but debugging the JavaScript was a pain. As far as I'm aware, the only thing that comes close to a proper debugging tool on iOS is Firebug Lite, which has some substantial limitations. Because it's not integrated into the browser, it can't catch a lot of problems. No syntax error catching (you're left hunting for that missing bracket on your own), and no reporting of HTTP issues if an external script isn't loading properly.\nThe interface is also pretty rough to use on a touch device — small tap targets, and it resizes strangely if you try to zoom. As someone who relies a fair bit on Safari and Chrome's developer tools when doing JavaScript development, I found it fairly frustrating when I ran into any sort of bug.\nThat said, if your development is more server-side, or you otherwise don't depend on those sorts of debugging tools, the iPad could very well make a good development environment for you.\nEditor Options\nIf you just want to use Vim, then an SSH client like Prompt or iSSH would work well, combined with a remote server somewhere (which you'll need anywhere for viewing files). If you want an option that doesn't require network access, there is an iOS port of Vim, but it's worth noting that the files are only accessible through iTunes (i.e. you can't upload them to an SFTP server or view them locally with Safari).\nIf you want a more native experience, Diet Coda is worth a look, as it integrates a lot of useful tools — SFTP, a full SSH client, code editor and browser. It's definitely on the pricier side of iOS apps, but I've read good things about it.\nTextastic is another good editor, with some nice extensions to the software keyboard (useful for making changes in a pinch if you don't have a Bluetooth one with you). I'm not a big fan of its file access model however. There's not much concept of syncing — rather you download files from a source (SFTP, Dropbox or WebDAV), edit them locally, then re-upload. An option to edit directly into Dropbox or SFTP would be nice, but that's a bit of a personal preference.\n\nA: If you're just looking for a straight text editor, Textastic has a lot of nice features.\nFor full-fledged web development, check out Diet Coda. It has built-in SSH terminal, SFTP, a great text editor, etc.\n\nA: You could use the OnLive Desktop product.\nExcerpt from their website:\n\n\"Based upon OnLive's instant-action cloud gaming technology, OnLive         Desktop delivers a seamless Microsoft® Windows® desktop experience\n  with cloud-accelerated Web browsing with full Adobe® Flash.\n  Instant-response multi-touch gestures enable complete and convenient\n  viewing and editing of even the most complex documents, with\n  high-speed transfer from cloud storage or Web mail attachments.\nRich media, such as video, animation, slide transitions and even PC games—never before practical via remote desktop delivery—run fluidly\n  and dynamically with instant-action interactivity. OnLive Desktop\n  makes remote feel local.\"\n\n\nA: Prompt is the best SSH client for iOS. Using Prompt you can remotely use Vim, and Firebug lite for debugging. (As suggested by @Aaron Miller.)\nPrompt is developed by Panic, the development team behind Diet Coda. It is also included within Diet Coda.\n\nA: You can use Koding, that is responsive and works perfectly in your browser. You won't need to install anything on your iPad. You'll have access to all the power of a server in your browser. Worth checking out.\n\nA: There is a brand new app called \"Dringend\". It's just like xcode - you can programm and build/test Apps on Mac & iOS -> https://itunes.apple.com/de/app/dringend-development-environment/id822329054?mt=8\n\nA: Debugging on iPad\nI will probably get slayed for this, but this would be my solution to you requirement:\nIf you want to do a proper web debugging your best choice would be selling the iPad on ebay and getting android tablet. I have struggled for days do get around iPad's/Apples inability to provide solid solution for debugging on the go (unless you fancy dragging your iLaptop with your iPad as well).\nI have found only one app in app store called MIHTool, which didn't work properly at all.\n\nA: I think GoCoEdit - The Remote Code and Text Editor is a great alternative Code Editor for iPhone and iPad.\n\nA: I think Buffer Editor is the best Code Editor for iPhone and iPad.

I've executed the codesign executable properly, I believe, but I still get the Gatekeeper warning. Simple question:\nWhen I verify the signing, I get the following output:\n$ codesign --verify --verbose /Applications/My\\ App.app\nApplications/My App.app/: valid on disk\nApplications/My App.app/: satisfies its Designated Requirement  \n\nNothing in there leads me to believe that there's a problem, but I guess I don't really know what I should see. Does this response indicate that the app is signed or something else?\n\nA: Based on the comments I think I have a something close to an answer:\nI think it will be the fact that it is Thawte.  We have a Thawte cert for Windows, and we could successfully sign Mac software with it, but Apple/MacOS treated it as if it was self signed or signed with not enough authority.\nFor Mac-signing we signed up to the Mac developer program ($100/year) and got an Apple created cert.  With that for example MacOS did let people start the signed app when it was downloaded from the internet.\n\nA: You are correct - codesign --verify --verbose is the terminal manner to verify that an application bundle is properly signed. I also like to pass the app through a display:\ncodesign --display --verbose=4 /path/to/App.app/\n\nBy inspecting the details, I ensure the proper code signing certificate was selected.\nYou can also test things by changing your settings (or AirDropping the file to a Mac that hasn't run that app) to only run apps that are signed - and double clicking it in the Finder.\n\nA: See:\nChecking apps for a \"GateKeeper\" Developer ID?\n\ncodesign -dvvv <path to app.app>\n\nShould output something like:\nExecutable=/Volumes/Big Disk/F376/Projects/<My App>\nIdentifier=<My Bundle ID>\nFormat=bundle with Mach-O thin (x86_64)\nCodeDirectory v=20100 size=3958 flags=0x0(none) hashes=189+5 location=embedded\nHash type=sha1 size=20\nCDHash=761b0d1XXXXXXXXXX0dc8dd42e38eb445fb5341f\nSignature size=8504\nAuthority=Developer ID Application: XXXXXX\nAuthority=Developer ID Certification Authority\nAuthority=Apple Root CA\nTimestamp=May 7, 2013 3:07:59 PM\nInfo.plist entries=30\nSealed Resources rules=4 files=128\nInternal requirements count=1 size=224\n\n\nJust a heads up, at this time, signing with a 3rd party valid code signing certificate is not going to pass GateKeeper.

Especially as the preferences for 'On start up, use' and 'New windows open with: Same Profile' seem to make setting a new default unnecessary. \n", "Q: Scripting on iPad - accessing features like accelerometer, GPS, etc Are there any scripting languages for the iPad that can access native functionality like accelerometer, GPS, text messages, etc?\nI know that it is possible to write Scheme and Python scripts but I don't think they can access any of the native functionality. \nIs there any way to do this? \nIf not, why not? Is it that Apple won't allow scripting environments in to the app store or is it the case that no one has bothered creating it?\n\nA: techBASIC 3.1 supports the following connection and build-in sensor technologies:\n\n\n*\n\n*Bluetooth LE.\n\n*WiFi via TCP/IP, HTTP, FTP.\n\n*HiJack (An A-D converter that plugs into the headphone jack).\n\n*Built-in accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer.\n\n*Access to composite information for heading, location (GPS/hotspot/cell tower), elevation, direction of travel.\n\n*Send emails (with user intervention).\n\n*Take photos or access the photo library.\nIt does not support:\n\n\n*\n\n*The serial port.

Besides using Python to get current GPS location, the author is building a GPS Radio Tracking System, and uses Python as the scripting language.\nHowever, for apps I use either techBASIC, or another basic called SmartBASIC. \nIn one app I just use algebra and trig and geometry if I want to determine heading and using the built-in accelerometer, I can predict where the user will be in say 2 hours and produce a weather report by calculating what the anticipated GPS will be based on heading and speed of travel.\nMost languages will give you native GPS data, and in SmartBASIC, it will also give you an off-by error, a +/- reading as well.\nSmartBASIC, once you turn GPS on, it starts storing every point in an array, in case you are building an mapping app. You have access to all the past readings. If you want the current GPS, you need to loop your GPS call until there are no more readings.\nIn techBASIC, you can specify a wait period, which I believe has the same function.\nI've tested both and the GPS readings are spot on. Even though you say the device's GPS sensor provides the same data, if you are not careful coding it, you will get different results.\nGood luck.\n\nA: Look at techBASIC ( http://www.byteworks.us/Byte_Works/techBASIC.html ).

To be able to open it, you need to right-click the folder and select the Show Package Contents option.\n\nOnce installed, make sure the app’s folder is not on your desktop or you will not be able to copy files to it.

If you don’t see this option, it means you’re accessing the app. Right click and select Open to bypass Gatekeeper and you will find a folder named Obscurity in the window that opens. Double clicking to open the folder will either yield an error or an empty folder. Open it via the Show Package Contents option and drag files over this folder. Close it when you’re done.\nThe files will not be indexed by Spotlight and will not appear in All Files in Finder. The best thing about this app is that it accomplishes its purpose of hiding your files.\n", "Q: How to I protect my jailbroken iPhone/iPod Touch/iPad? People always say, \"Jailbreaking can cause security problems.\" That might be true, but in some instances, you just need to jailbreak it.\nHow can I protect my iPhone and my data when it is jailbroken? Is there an app (through Cydia), that allows me to modify anything, or is there no easy application that does this? I'm pretty sure jailbreaking just removes the part of the OS that only allows you to download apps from the App Store. You think you would be able to modify that file/part of the system and allow it access to Cydia or whatever, and then somehow create a secure network and screen apps for viruses or whatever.\n\nA: On a general level, I'd personally secure a jailbroken phone by re-enabling the code signing restrictions of iOS, ensure sandbox requirements are upheld and turn off all remote access. Furthermore, disabling all root accounts and choosing secure passwords for all remaining accounts that your specific jailbreak process creates or modifies would be prudent. \nApple has teams of people to police third party apps, set up sandboxes, audit security, etc… When you jailbreak, you take responsibility for all of those activities which carries a large technical burden to know what to check in the first place and then how to secure things.\nAt some point, this exercise becomes a bit metaphysical  - Do you trust Apple to engineer and watch the device? Do you trust yourself to be up on securing unix systems (Practical Unix and Internet Security, 3rd Edition is a fabulous book)? Do you trust the jailbreak to document what changes it has made and allow you the control over security you desire?\nThere are clearly times when a jailbroken phone (in the hands of a knowledgable operator) can be more secure than Apple's current iOS if it patches a vulnerability that you need to have closed now and not when Apple patches it - but for most, sticking as close to Apple's configuration as possible is the best plan from a security stance.\n\nA: Update: I found this:\nOne thing you can do it change the root password of your iPhone to prevent viruses from getting in with the common password.\n\nA: Aside from changing you default passwords if you install openssh, don't install from shady repositories. Thats the only real risk I can see. Some people may try to call whatever exploit was used to allow jailbreaking a 'security issue', but often with each jailbreak there is a package you can install that closes said hole.\n\nA: Yes, changing your root password and \"mobile\" password is a very good way of preventing viruses, but the way to go is not to install from repositories/sources that have a bad reputation. \nWhat you said about \"download apps\" is correct. In fact, Cydia itself has root access. What it does is it downloads the ipa and installs it as a application. The app store is unaffected.\n", "Q: How can I set up a shell script as a wrapper to the main executable of an app? I have an application that I want to launch via a shell script that does some setup and then launches the app itself with some specific options. Ideally, this script would be run whenever the application would normally be launched, i.e. when I click on it in the dock, double-click in the Applications folder, launch from QS, or even click on a file that opens in this app.\nRight now I have an applescript wrapper \"App\" for my script, but the downside is that it appears as a separate app from the main app that sits in my dock, so I have to remember to not click on the main app's icon, but launch this alternate app instead. \nSo is this something that is possible to do? One idea I had is to rename the main executable in the app to something else, and then replace it with my script. Is that a reasonable thing to do, or is there a better solution?\nFor those who are curious, I am trying to set up Emacs.app to launch a daemon and then open using emacsclient. Basically, I want to have this script launch instead of emacs (and I'm going to modify the script to take file arguments and open them as well).\n\nA: Use /Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/Emacs (or other executable in that directory). \nGenerally, application bundles are structured as above. Use Terminal to 'ls' your way to the file.\n\nA: I would start with a tool like Platypus to make your script have all the accoutrements of an App and test to see that things work as expected.\nAutomator also has a nice GUI for deciding how to handle arguments to a script - and we have several questions here that explore how to pass arguments into and out of an Automator action / applet.\nWithout more details on how your daemon is designed and how you launch it, I can only pick away at some of the elements to your solution, but since anyone can edit this answer to provide more details (or answer a stand-alone answer) - perhaps this can get the ball rolling to get you a solution.\n\nA: I was able to get what I wanted by going into the App folder Contents/MacOS and renaming the Emacs binary to Emacs.real. Then I put in my script and named it Emacs to replace the binary, and set it up to call Emacs.real after doing the necessary setup. Then launching the app launches my script.\nUnfortunately, there are other issues with Emacs' daemon mode that prevent me from using it, but at least I solved this issue!\n", "Q: iOS6 and Bluetooth OBDII Adapters Does anyone know of a OBDII Bluetooth adapter that works with iPhone? I would be developing an application for the iPhone 5 where Bluetooth 4.0 is supported. I have found several adapters, but they do not support Bluetooth 4.0.   \nI am aware that Apple restricts Bluetooth development for Bluetooth versions before 4.0. Is there anyway to work around this so I could use older versions of Bluetooth? I am open to Jailbreaking the device if needed. \nWiFi adapters are not an option. \nThanks\n\nA: Dash ( http://drivewithdash.com/ ) is promising a Bluetooth 4.0 ODB-II module, but it's not available yet; it's a Kickstarter project as of this writing ( http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/shred444/drive-with-dash ).\nAlso take a look at Automatic ( http://www.automatic.com/ ), as Brad Larson mentioned in the comments above.\n\nA: I am beta-testing Automatic right now. It isn't exactly a ODBII device, as much as it is a  driving assistant. It does log ODBII codes, and allows you to clear the vehicle's computer when one comes up. \nHowever, it also determines when you do hard brakes, hard acceleration, and when you exceed 70 MPH, effectively trying to coach you into better driving habits. It also logs your trips, gives you your gas mileage, gas cost, and when GPS is used, your complete trip is logged on a map, with time started and stopped.\n\nA: the LELink device by \nhttp://www.outdoor-apps.com\ndoes work with iPhone.\nI am also working on an application and have so far issued an \"ATZ\" command and got back \"ELM v1.5\" using ios core bluetooth library.\nYou need a 4s or later iPhone.\n", "Q: Determining The Complete Size Of A Folder & Its Sub-Folders in Finder?

I am about to scan my photo collection. To save time, I would like to scan multiple photos at once. How can I automate the splitting of photos in a single scan?\n\nA: The builtin \"Image Capture\" in macOS does this just fine. Just set \"Auto detection\" to \"Detect Separate Items\". See here for a more thorough explanation: https://appletoolbox.com/how-to-scan-photos-images-by-using-iphoto-on-a-mac/\n\nA: Photoshop and the cheaper Photoshop Elements both have options that can take one large image and automatically crop out sub-images. In Photoshop, the command you're looking for is File → Automate → Crop and Straighten Photos. In Elements, it's Image → Divide Scanned Photos. For more details, read this and this.\nIf you don't want to spend the money on Photoshop, you can download ImageMagick, and use this script to perform the separation. However it's worth noting that it's a command-line tool, so some familiarity with the command-line would help, although if you read the instructions on the script page carefully, that should be enough to get started.\nWhatever tool you use, when you're scanning your photos, make sure you leave some space between them, and use something that will give a high contrast background, so the software will have a better chance of picking up where one photo begins and another ends.\n\nA: Another 3rd party app for this: SnipTag. Like Photoshop, it can crop 5-6 photos scanned together. Additionally, it can batch crop scans: upload a batch of such multiple scans, and one click crops them all. It supports JPG, PNG, TIFF formats and any DPI setting. It's cheaper than Photoshop, and also includes a metadata editor (I actually downloaded it for batch-editing metadata, and discovered the auto-cropping feature later.)\n", "Q: what is the hotkey to move to a particular desktop out of all the desktops I know i can use 3 swipe left and right to move to the previous or next desktop, but I think it would be more helpful to have a hotkey to do it and not just moving previously or next, but rather to a particular one.\n\nA: *\n\n*Open System Preferences\n\n*Select \"Keyboard\" under \"the Hardware\" section\n\n*Select the \"Keyboard Shortcuts\" tab\n\n*Select \"Mission Control\" from the left table\n\n*Expand the \"Mission Control\" section\nOnce there you can see, set, and enable shortcuts to individual Mission Control screens.\n\n", "Q: Is there any way I can hide all files and folders from the OS X Desktop, but leave the Hard Drive(s), CD's, External Drives, Network Drives there? I was hoping there was a way I would be able to make all folders and files hidden on the OS X Desktop, but leave the Hard drive(s), network drives, CD's/DVD's, etc. But if I was to go into the Desktop Folder using Finder, the items would still be there. So, basically the opposite of the Finder Preferences of showing specific items on the desktop, to hide the files, etc. but leave the HDD's, CD's, etc.:  \n\nThanks a lot\n\nA: What I do is just have a folder on the desktop which I occasionally throw things into when the desktop gets too cluttered - at least you only have one thing visible on the desktop. You could also try https://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/48203/desktop-pirate\n\nA: While the comments above are correct (the Desktop folder and the actual Desktop are the same thing), you still can choose to hide all your files/folders on your desktop if you wish to do so:\nFrom the terminal:\ndefaults write com.apple.finder CreateDesktop -bool false\n\nthen you need to restart the Finder for it to reflect the modification:\nkillall Finder\n\nTo switch things back to the default:\ndefaults write com.apple.finder CreateDesktop -bool true\n\nthen you need to restart the Finder:\nkillall Finder\n\nBut - bear in mind that this method will hide everything on the Desktop.\n\nA: From Terminal use \nchflags hidden ~/Deskop/foldername/ \nfor each of the folder (see man chflags), or even \nchflags hidden ~/Deskop/* \nThis will make them disappear from Finder.\n", "Q: Installation stuck at grey boot screen on Macbook Pro 4,1 (Early 2008) I would appreciate any help you guys can give me since I would really like to upgrade my laptop to Mountain Lion.\nComputer: Macbook Pro 17\" 4,1 (Early 2008)\nRAM: 4 GB RAM\nHard drive: 128 SSD Hard drive\nVideo card: NVIDIA GeForce 8600M GT\nCurrent OS: Snow Leopard 10.6.8\nSteps I have taken but failed to properly install the OS.\n\n\n*\n\n*Dowloaded Mountain Lion at least 3 times from the App store to make sure the download wasn't corrupted.\n\n*I even tried making a Lion Bootdisk so I can install Mountain Lion on a USB drive (Install ESD.dmg).\n\n*I have even tried installing Lion first thinking I would take it one version at a time but gets stuck on boot screen too.\n\n*I even changed my hard drive to a new blank SSD drive to see any difference.\n\n*Each time I install Mountain Lion or Lion, everything is good until the installer has to restart the laptop.\n\n*Laptop gets stuck at the grey boot screen with the Apple logo and the loading circle.

I mean is Objective-C the only language available, or can you use a standard C compiler/linker that is optimized for the sufficient executable format(Mach-O/PEF)?\nMy basic question is, can other languages be used to generate the equivalent object, binary, or otherwise shared library file format of code parsed and loaded by Mac OS X-like versions?\n(E.g., C, C++, D, etc.?)\n\nA: You can use C or C++ too to compile binaries and executables.  Objective-C is mainly the source for developing for the MacOS user interface (Cocoa), but even there is still the old school interface (Carbon) available, just for the latter sample projects and docs are hard to find these days.\nBut if you want to create a tool that works like classic unix tools (stdin/stdout) or a shared library, C or C++ are absolutely viable solutions. E.g. you can download Xcode and from the Gui or command line (gcc) you can easily compile a simple int main(int, char**) { printf(\"Hello World!\"); return 0; } program.\nAlso, Objective-C is just a C-extension, so you don't have to use its features.\n\nA: There are lots of other languages that can be used to create iOS apps.

This option only changes System and other files that belong to the OS). \n(Of course, be careful not to select a full erase/reinstall option. And a full time machine backup is still highly recommended. If things go wrong, you can then do a full erase/install, and the installer will prompt you to restore personal files via your time machine backup.)\n\nA: Try to start up in safe mode first (by holding shift on startup). You might be able to use Finder normally.\nIf that doesn't work, you can back up files to an external disk by starting up from the installation DVD, opening Disk Utility, and saving a disk image of the Macintosh HD volume.

See the screenshot at:\n\nAs you can see in the screenshot, the font for the apostrophe character (which includes a big space after it) isn't actually Cambria; instead, it's\nＭＳ 明朝 (Body Asian)\nIt seems that Cambria automatically uses this font for apostrophes, and that the apostrophe character for this font includes the extra space.\nHow should I go about fixing this so that apostrophes appear correctly? I'm guessing it might be some kind of font conflict, but I'm not sure: and I don't know how to fix font conflicts, in any case.\n(Originally posted at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16873412/incorrect-apostrophe-character-in-ms-word-2011-on-mac)\n\nA: After updating OS X to 10.9 and opening Word for the first time since the update I encountered the same problem. I spent half a day testing all the suggestions put forward here and in other forums responding to the same query (including checking autoformat preferences/searching for font duplicates/verifying fonts/testing in new mac user account/repairing permissions etc.) with no luck.\nFinally, I deleted the Cambria font from the Font Book and reinstalled again. I reopened Word and tested and the problem seems to have disappeared.\nI'm using OS X 10.9 and Word for Mac 2011, v14.3.8.\n\nA: Normally you would not expect this kind of thing (font substitution) to happen unless your default font had no character for the Unicode curly apostrophe.  Is it possible you have an old, non-Unicode (e.g. Postscript) version of your font installed that is being used by mistake?\nPS I have found a reference to this same problem in the MS Forums from 2011. Perhaps it will help:\nhttp://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/mac/forum/macoffice2011-macword/normal-template-is-using-asian-font-for/d79e850a-8df0-4540-bc93-cf3901b7cd99?msgId=54e54894-ebbb-4764-845d-35785d362b40\n\nA: Is your OSX Language & Text setting set to something other than English?  (I'm guessing that it IS set to English, based on your screenshot.)\nIt's possible that Word's default language is not set to English (US) (or your English-speaking country of choice).  Ensure that it is set to the correct language by opening any document in Word, then go to Tools/Language, select English (US) (or whichever English variant is appropriate), then click the \"Default\" button and verify the change to the Normal.dot template.  Then, create a new document and type text that includes an apostrophe, and report back on the result.\nReference: http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2007-word/extra-space-after-apostrophe/13edb10b-6a5f-464e-8f33-0b41c63c4680\n\nA: Two options for the unsophisticated that worked for me:\n\n\n*\n\n*Under Word > Preferences > AutoCorrect > Replace as You Type unselect\n\"'Straight question marks'\" with 'smart quotation marks'\". Unfortunately, this leaves you with straight quotation marks and apostrophes.\n\n*Use Calibri as your font while writing, then convert everything to\nyour font of choice when you are done. Unfortunately, this can be a pain where you are trying editing a document or finalizing the spacing.\nI did not have any luck with adding all the word fonts to font book or with changing the proofing language.\n\nA: I solved the problem by:\nhome menu\n-typography\n--tick the box saying AV with an arrow above and an arrow below, pointing in different directions (switch on kerning). \nI don't know what other problems this might cause elsewhere in my document, as Word is a mystery at best. \n\nA: I've seen this problem and the cause turned out to be that Cambria was simply turned off in FontBook. I fixed it by highlighting all the fonts in FontBook, enabling them and then resolving any duplicates it caused.\n", "Q: ipad mini bought London UK may 2013 I have a house in france, and just charged the ipad mini with a french plug.

The reason you have so many site-packages directories (you actually have more than you listed in your question) is that it seems like you've installed a python.org version (the /Library/Frameworks/... one) and perhaps a third-party version from Homebrew or some other package manager (MacPorts by default installs into the /opt/local directory). Your version of pip was also installed from that source, so if you want to use the python.org version as your default then you'll need to install pip again (make sure you use the setuptools version, as distribute is defunct).

Every time I boot my air back up it tells me in the App Store that there is still an update that needs to be taken.\nAny suggestions?\n\nA: Do you happen to have FileVault enabled? If so, you cannot update the firmware on the drive at this state. \nThe firmware update happens before the OS decrypts/unlocks the drive, thus at FW update time, the drive is not accessible.\nThe only solution I know is a bit of a pain: \n\n\n*\n\n*turn off FileVault\n\n*run the update\n\n*turn FileVault back on\n\n\nA: File Vault was not turned on and I could not find the cause. I did a reinstall and tried the update from a new install of OS X. The update took and all is well. Perhaps it had something to do with me having a bootcamp partition? No idea.\nReinstall worked however.\n\nA: After several tries with the same result described above, I did a safe-restart (holding the shift key) and the firmware update began. Something other than FileVault was obviously creating the same problem.\n", "Q: Aperture: Library over multiple Hard Drives I switched to Aperture some time ago. And right now, the moment has come that I want to save some space on my internal hard drive. What I found on the Apple website is this:\n\nI can't seem to find this feature. Online tutorials simply suggest to create multiple libraries and switch between them. But I'm looking for the kind of solution that Apple suggests in this screenshot: I want to use Aperture with my library (one single big library) and Aperture manages where all pictures are stored, across the multiple hard drives. It should be something going on at the background, out of my knowledge. I just want to be the clueless user of the application.\nHas anyone found how to do this?\n\nA: This is a very easy operation that basically is one menu item away.\n\n\n*\n\n*File -> Relocate Originals…\n\n\nSo, just connect whatever drive you want to store some photos on and select those photos (by project, album, smart folder, whatever) and then relocate them.\nA standard file dialog will appear and you can move them to whatever folder you want on the other drive(s).\nAperture will then update the database and move the large / original version of each photo to the drive selected. When you are using aperture and the drive is not connected, you still have a preview version to work on / edit / crop / correct / etc… If you perform some operation where the original is needed, Aperture will ask nicely that you connect the drive, but for routine tasks - you may not even need the original version for daily use.\n\nA: I cannot say that I have Apple's exact solution for doing this, but to span one large library upon multiple hard drives, you can combine your hard drives with RAID to form one large drive. Now, this will only work in special cases. RAID cannot be spread between an internal and external hard drive. For RAID to work the best, the hard drives should all be the same hardware and in some type of RAID enclosure.\nNow, what you might be looking for will probably be closer to this Span Aperture Library over Multiple Drives It uses symbolic links to span it over multiple drives, but this is much more involves and requires the use of Terminal.\nApple does not actually seem to have a straight-forward easy way to span your library. Otherwise, symbolic links and RAID are your best bet.\n", "Q: Are there iOS/iPad apps that work well to edit XML? I'm surprised that a google search doesn't turn up dozens of XML editors for ipad. All I can find are generic code text editors that happen to \"support\" XML. Well duh. \nI'm looking for an ipad app that lets me edit arbitrary XML as something other than a generic text box with code completion. It could at least give me an expandable tree view of nested tags for example. And it could allow me to add a child tag or duplicate an existing one. Or do a structured search of the document based on identified symbols, or even some automated manipulation based on symbols.

The status of the LVG is 'Offline' and the status of the PV is 'Checking'. It has been this way for over 10 hours on a 128GB SSD.\nTo me it seems this status indicates some kind of intermediary status, as if the conversion/encryption has not completed yet, is that assumption correct?\nIs it safe to shut down the machine in this state?\n\nIn Disk Utility.app the disk name is shown in red! I can run the Verify Disk command and the output seems ok (ends with 'The volume {UUID of the LVG} appears to be OK' and 'The partition map appears to be OK'). \nBut in the output of Verify Disk I see mention of a logical volume ('Logical Volume Group contains 1 Logical Volume'), which the output of diskutil cs list does not show.

In System Preferences FileVault is encrypting with 18 minutes left.

Is it via the Headphone/Audio Line-Out Port?\nIf so, do I connect it directly to the optical port of the Amplifier or do I have to also buy a DAC?\nRegards,\nValentin Ivanov\n\nA: Yes the iMac have optical out, most Macs do.\nYou need one of these Toslink adapter that plugs into standard 3.5mm audio plug for iMac to output optical from that.\nThose are pretty cheap, and most are bundled with the cable itself or some audio accessories.

If you hold on to home and power then just hold home, it goes past the hard reset and into dev mode.  To get out of it, you can either connect to itunes and force a reset or press home and power for 3 seconds only.  That should get you out of it...\nI can't tell you how many times I had this issue.

I want to print via USB, but iOS does not mention the interface when I connect directly to my non-Wi-Fi printer.\nREALIZE: I do not want to print wirelessly I want to do so via USB, but iOS apparently does not have drivers/kernel extendablr modules to support printing like this, such as with Lion.\nAny workarounds? Any device drivers?\nI will write one myself if there is no program to help with this.\n\nA: Source of everything I'm about to say: I'm an iOS developer.\nNo.\nYour iOS device does not contain the necessary drivers to print via USB - and here's why:\nDevelopers\nWe are kind of, well, lazy. We don't want to write more code than we have to - we want to write one thing once and have it work.\nNow imagine all the iOS devs now have to take into account that you can print from USB. Now we might have to write code to take that into account, there might be subtle differences in the drivers, etc.\nThe nice thing about AirPrint is it just works. Not just from the user's standpoint, but also from the developer's standpoint. Developers can basically 'layout' the paper just like they would a bunch of views onscreen, send it to a print controller, and let it handle everything else.\nNice and easy.\nYou\nYou're a user. You want things to just work, right? Even as a developer, I want the stuff I'm using to just work (See Stack Overflow for thousands of examples).\nIf Apple put in kernel drivers and USB printer drivers and all whatnot, the user now has to manage that, and Apple has to conform to HP's, Canon's and Brother's requirements.\nWith AirPrint, the manufacturer conforms to Apple - a much better experience for you and me, the users.\n\nA: The only printing ability native to iOS is AirPrint which requires either an AirPrint enabled printer in your WLAN or a AirPrint driver on your Mac/Windows computer.\n", "Q: Does Apple care if I develop a software compatibility layer to run iOS apps on it? I was considering building a compatibility layer for Snow Leopard to run iOS apps on it without touch-screen controls so thay way you can have OS X and iOS running together.\nIs there any terms against this?\n\nA: No.\nWell, kind of.\nIf you do build such a thing, Apple probably won't allow it in the Mac App Store - that's my gut feeling. However, they wouldn't be able to keep you from distributing it on your own.\nBut...\nNote: From this point on, I will only be talking about this idea. Nothing more. And don't get discouraged.\nThere's a problem here: architecture. From what I understand, you want to make an app-like-thing that allows you to run iOS apps on OSX.\nHere's the thing: All modern OS X machines run on an Intel architecture. All modern iOS devices run on an armv7(s) architecture.\nWhy's that a problem? When an iOS developer compiles their code, the compiler that's all the little statements and methods and things and turns it into instructions.\nIntel chips and armv7(s) chips have different architectures - meaning different instruction sets, meaning - well, you would have to get hold of the developer's source code for an app to be able to pull this off.\nNot just one app - every app you want to run in this layer.\nStill, there might be a way to do it. If you find it, you can make lots of money.

If I put a picture on my Mac to photostream and it moves to my iPhone's photostream and I delete the picture from my photostream on my Mac, will there still be a picture left on the iPhone in the camera roll?\n\nA: No.\nWhen you delete an image from Photo Stream, there is a message (at least on iOS) that says something like\n\nThe image will disappear from Photo Stream on all your devices.\n\nHence, deleted means no longer in Photo Stream anywhere.\n\nA: Yes. the photo remains on the camera roll, but deleted from the stream. \n", "Q: How do I get OS X 10.8.x to keep Finder windows open after a restart? I just installed OS X 10.8.x on my Mac. An annoying thing I've discovered is that, whenever I restart the computer, it closes all the windows I have open in Finder. This is extremely annoying as I often have a large number of windows open to help me keep track of what I've been working on that day and need to back up. I check the \"Reopen windows when logging back in\" on the restart command but, as far as I can tell, it just reopens my applications, which isn't really what I'm looking for.\n\nA: Try unchecking System Preferences > General > Close windows when quitting an application. 10.7 restored the state of applications by default but 10.8 doesn't.\nThis enables restoring state in just Finder:\ndefaults write com.apple.Finder NSQuitAlwaysKeepsWindows -bool true\nkillall Finder\n\n", "Q: In the app store how do you determine if an app is iCloud compatible before purchase? A few months ago on the Arqade site I asked if the iOS version of Chrono Trigger put save games in the cloud. DCol provided a great answer detailing how to check if iOS apps you own backup to the cloud:\n\nTo check for other games/apps (if you own them) look under Settings >\n  iCloud > Storage & Backup > Manage Storage.\nThe apps listed under 'Documents & Data' sync between devices.\nThe apps listed under your device's name are backed up, but not synced\n  via iCloud unless they are also in the previously mentioned list.\nSome games/apps sync using cloud servers other than iCloud (Eg:\n  Dropbox). In this case, they would appear in the back-up list, but not\n  the Documents & Data list, but would still be syncing.\n\nWhile his answer is still the best one given the question I asked I was about to ask a similar question concerning another game. Obviously this won't scale. Is there a way in the app store to determine if an app (game) is iCloud (or other sync service) compatible before purchase?\n\nA: Honestly the best option is to just read the description in the App Store, the developer's website, and any reviews you can find. There's nothing in the App Store metadata that will tell you whether it uses iCloud or not.\n", "Q: How to remount an internal drive as read-write in mountain lion Suddenly a secondary drive with HFS+ partition changed from read-write to read-only. How can I use the mount command to reverse it in mountain lion?\n\nA: The answers in this thread did not work for me, but this did:\n  sudo mount -u -o rw /Volumes/VolName\n\n\nA: This happens sometimes when a drives filesystem is corrupted. Run Disk Utility and check the filesystem and drive for errors.\n\nA: Occassionaly when this happens to me I need to use the disk utility included with OSX to verify and repair the disk.

I've read quite a bit on Ask Different and elsewhere about how fitting a Solid State Drive (SSD) is one of the best ways (if not the best way) to increase the performance of your Apple Mac computer.\nAFAIK this is a piece of hardware that is fitted internally inside the computer in place of the regular hard drive (and therefore takes a bit of technical know-how).\nHow then does an External SSD as exemplified here fit into the equation of increasing the performance of your Apple Mac ? (or am I getting the wrong end of the stick.)\n\nA: It's definitely worth going internal. Someone asked the question some time ago here and the conclusion was, that even with USB3 (which only the newest Macs have), the internal version is more than 50% faster.\nUSB3 external will probably still be faster than a regular 2.5\" MacBook drive (assuming that you have a MacBook), maybe even with USB2, but with older hardware (and thus older connectors, e.g. just USB2) the margins will get slimmer.\nIt may depend on your machine (e.g. if you still have warranty or if it is one that is hard to take apart, like the the very new superslim iMacs), but having retrofitted an SSD into a 2009 iMac I can say the benefit does outweigh efforts IMO.\nAlso given the SSD you linked there, you can get a current Samsung of the same size less expensive and spend the rest of the money for someone skilled to put it into your machine.\n\nA: There are two factors at play here:\n\n\n*\n\n*How is the storage drive connected to the CPU? (which bus and what else shares that bus)\n\n*How are the bare drives comparable for file access times?\n\n\nFor the jump from HDD to SSD - the bigger factor is the drive and not the bus. There are many benefits to having a drive internal, but benchmark speeds isn't a prime reason. My guess is that if you had the same SSD mounted via USB 3.0, FireWire, Thunderbolt and SATA internally - any of these would get most of the speedup of an internal drive.\nI would expect it to be hard to even measure the difference between Thunderbolt and SATA direct connect and I would also expect that if someone didn't know how the drive were connected, you couldn't observe the speed difference between the other connect methods on a modern Mac (but that a benchmark would reveal average access speeds a bit slower on USB or Firewire than if it were connected over a lower latency / higher bandwidth bus).\n", "Q: Writing to plist file multiple preferences same time I need to write about 50 preferences to a .plist file. Is there any way to write just once to plist file? My current code has 50 defaults write lines.\ndo shell script \"defaults write testing.testing mypref \" & \"Kjlk\"\ndo shell script \"defaults write testing.testing otherpref \" & \"something\"\ndo shell script \"defaults write testing.testing thirdpref \" & \"whateva\"\n...\n\n\nA: Mac's default command is not designed to work like that.  \nYou will see a substantial speedup by having Applescript make (or call) one shell script to issue all 50 commands. You can wrap both versions of the script in a date call or use the time function to time the shell script if you are not sure where the delay lies on your Mac.\nThe vast majority of the delay will likely be Applescript looping and then forking each an environment for each script to be executed. By writing one script, not only will the startup be reduced to 1/50 of the time, it will likely execute far faster overall.\nIf you really wanted to, you could write yourself a function to parse multiple inputs; but it's probably easier for you just to have 50 lines of shell script.\n\nA: As demure's answer mentioned, a single do shell script commmand would be faster:\ndo shell script \"defaults write testing.testing mypref Kjlk\ndefaults write testing.testing otherpref something\ndefaults write testing.testing thirdpref whateva\"\n\nYou can also use System Events to edit plists:\ntell application \"System Events\" to tell contents of property list file \"/tmp/test.plist\"\n    make new property list item at end with properties {kind:string, name:\"key\", value:\"value\"}\n    make new property list item at end with properties {kind:string, name:\"key2\", value:\"value2\"}\n    set value of property list item \"key2\" to \"value3\"\nend tell\n\nBoth took about 0.5 seconds adding 100 new keys. Multiple do shell script commands took about 2 seconds. \n\nA: \nIf you really wanted to, you could write yourself a function to parse multiple inputs\n\nThanks. I think i will create one shell script.\nI have no idea what above quote means.\n", "Q: How to use the Homebrew installed git on Mac?

However, once it is unlocked, all contents are accessible to the User unlocking it. Is there a way to keep individual users' files encrypted, while making the 'general' part of the disk, and the files belonging to the user unlocking the disk accessible? \n\nA: In general, you can't keep any files from an administrative user that knows how to modify file permissions.\nFileVault is to keep untrusted users out of the entire disk - so you cannot allow an admin user/password into the hands of someone you don't trust.\nYou can make individual disk images and encrypt them with passwords that are not shared and that will ensure that other Admin accounts cannot look at the files. They could copy the store somewhere else and try to brute force things, they could install keyboard monitoring software to hope to catch you typing the passphrase, but they can't get into each user's private store without another piece of information.\nThis was one benefit of the older FileVault implementation where each user had their own store / their own key and the risk of cross contamination of user files was lessened.\n", "Q: Can I clone my Time Machine backups folder to an image file, to essentially backup the entire Time Machine? I'm interested in creating a clone of my Time Machine backups (the Backups.backupdb folder) so that my local backup strategy isn't entirely dependent on the external HD being alive. My hope is that I can backup the entire Time Machine contents to a single file (a disk image, sparse bundle, I'm not entirely sure of correct terminology) and then upload this file to a service like Amazon S3.\nIs there a method for doing so that is known to work well and result in an image file that can later be restored to an actual external disk and have all backed-up contents still be usable?\nI have one caveat to my situation which might complicate things - I have about 25GB of other data in other folders on this external HD which I would like to not include in a clone. I've taken a look at SuperDuper and it seems like it would clone the entire HD just  fine, but I don't see how to exclude files - and CCC doesn't even show the Backups.backupdb as an option in it's file picker (even after following these instructions).\n\nA: The answer is yes and the tool I would use for this task is Disk Utility.\nYou can use the File menu to select New Disk Image from Folder… and choose only the Backups.backupdb folder as the source of the image.\n\nYou can start and see how it works, but I wanted to add some commentary as well since you already are seeing difficulties with other utilities explicitly not wanting any part of cloning Time Machine data.\nSince this folder contains hard links, if you don't choose a tool that respects hard links, you will end up with individual copies of each file and not the efficient storage that Time Machine uses.\nFor network use, you might choose a sparse disk image format which will be easier to copy to S3 and not lose the entire file if the transfer aborts in the middle.\nIf I were you, I'd perhaps pick important backup intervals and only move those to the offsite storage, but networks are fast enough that you could push an entire backup set to the cloud if you didn't mind paying the data transfer costs and waiting for the upload to be written to S3.\n", "Q: Command+Click does not work in Google Scholar + Firefox For example, see this page:\nhttp://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&q=cancer&btnG=&as_sdt=1%2C33&as_sdtp=\nWhen I do command+click on the article titles, Firefox does neither open a link nor open a tab.

When I do right click and manually choose \"Open Link in New Tab\", it works well.\nIs this only my problem, potentially a problem of one of my extensions?\nFirefox 21.0, OS X Mountain Lion\n\nA: No, it's not a problem restricted to your computer:\n\n\n*\n\n*Other Mac users (including me) have experienced similar problems with scholar.google.com and other websites when using Firefox 19.0.2 and version 20.0, or, in my case, with the same setup as yours (OS X 10.8.3 and Firefox 21).\n\n*Windows users have also reported this issue, for example here and here.\nI don't think it is not a problem caused by extensions, either. The problem seems rather related to how Firefox deals with some CSS code and Javascript plugins.\nThe extension NoScript can be used as a workaround at the cost of reducing functionality, because it blocks, among other things, JavaScript.\nAfter installing NoScript scholar.google.com behaved as expected when I ⌘-clicked the links.

Which one do I have to trust to?\nAnd if it isn't enough, I know that each partition retains a 10% of its size (even if it's tunable in a second moment with tunefs); so I'm able to use (by default) only up to 90% of it.\nI'm not expert enough to know if the HFS+ journaled filesystem will place any additional (hidden) file, but I suppose that I'm on the right way… can you tell me something more?\nI really appreciate any help you can provide.\n\nA: The sleep image file gets created to store the contents of RAM, so you should be able to make things fit by checking the math carefully.\n\n\n*\n\n*How OS X and iOS report storage capacity  - http://support.apple.com/kb/TS2419\nSo, once you've made sure you don't have errors in powers of 2, you can make a small allowance for the filesystem overhead and try using a partition to store this one file. You will want to also consider that the OS will take control of this file on a very low level and perhaps cause the file to be written to the root filesystem even if you take pains to properly mount the auxiliary filesystem. Also, since swap files get written to this same directory, your plan might cause unintended consequences, so be sure you have a good backup and can recover any file should the machine run out of space for /private/var/vm and freeze out whatever app you have running.\n", "Q: Can't run vi from terminal Every time I execute these commands:\nvi\n\nor\nvim\n\nin the terminal, it gives me the following error:\n-bash: /usr/local/bin/vi: No such file or directory\n\nor \n-bash: /usr/local/bin/vim: No such file or directory\n\nHow do I get it to look at /usr/bin instead of /usr/local/bin?\ntype -a vi vim\n\nreturns\nvi is /usr/bin/vi\nvim is /usr/bin/vim\n\nand\necho $PATH\n\nreturns\n/usr/local/bin:/opt/local/bin:/opt/local/sbin:/opt/local/bin:/opt/local/sbin:/opt/local/bin:/opt/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages:/Users/carlo/android-sdk-macosx/platform-tools:/Users/carlo/android-sdk-macosx/tools\n\nI effed up my settings when I was screwing around with MacVim and Homebrew.

In September, the link is now https://secure-appldnld.apple.com/iTunes11/041-8597.20130918.PmmEw/iTunesSetup.exe so you can see trying to pass around direct links is not a good general solution.\nThe best thing to do in this case is check that you don't have any DNS blockers or other web site plug in that attempt to control / restrict downloads and try refreshing that page (or try in another browser).\nApple support might also be a good place to open a ticket, since they usually support people looking to use iTunes or Apple ID for free since you can't spend money with them without these accounts and tools.\nOther things to try:\n\n\n*\n\n*Change your network (have a friend download the file from a different router / internet connection) and share it over Dropbox or other means - this would fix DNS issues or other network effects.\n\n*Change your browser - if Chrome or Firefox have add-ons, blockers, etc. - try disabling all browser scripts and extensions or even another browser like Opera or Lynx or Safari\n\n*Change your computer - downloading from another computer might show the problem is with DNS settings or something else specific to your PC.\n\n\nA: I couldn't download iTunes Windows 7 64 bit from Firefox 25.0.1, but had no problem when I used IE 11.

As such, I like to take my MacBook up there and work on a single task in the morning, which rearranges all my windows to accommodate a single screen, and that's fine.\nBut when I return to my external displays, I need the ability to make all my windows (at least if they're open) return where they belong. It only needs to associate an app with a location; I don't need it to remember locations of specific browser windows, etc.\nIs there a setting in OSX or an app (I'm willing to pay for it) that will allow me to either associate a layout with a monitor setup, or even just to save multiple layouts that I can snap back to when I switch configurations?\n\nA: There's an application call Stay that does this and works very nicely.\n\nA: I'm also looking for a such tool.

I'd like to update to the most recent firmware WHILE retaining my untethered jailbroken status, Cydia, and the unlocked feature of the phone which allows me to use it without a data plan. \nI've been told to simply update the phone in iTunes - will this retain all the things I mentioned above?\nWhen I click on update iPhone, it says iTunes will \"Verify this update with Apple\" (or something along those lines) - what does this mean? Does this mean that Apple will know I'm using an iPhone w/o a data plan and will they then notify AT&T?\nLastly, the \"backup\" that you can create in iTunes is only information - Like, if I tried to back up from a 6.1.3 to a \"backup\" that was created with a phone on 5.1.1 firmware it would NOT restore the phone to firmware 5.1.1, correct?\nThank you so very much for your time, whoever is able to answer these questions. It means a lot to me. Thank you again, Sebastian\n\nA: OK, I'll try to answer one-by-one.\nUpdating without loosing jailbreak\nI'm afraid that it's no longer possible. The most recent iOS version - 6.1.3 - does not currently have a jailbreak available. You would keep all you info, but wouldn't keep your jailbreak - nor be able to get it back soon.\nVerify this update with Apple\nIt just means that Apple will sign your update and get stats on what kind of devices are updating, etc. Ever wondered where those percentages they get for the Keynote graphs are coming from? Now you know.\nThey won't tell AT&T. Even if they did, there is nothing wrong with using a phone without a data plan. Who cares, anyway?\nThe Backup\nYes, it's only information - apps, app data, settings, pictures, etc.\nRestoring to that backup would keep your data and put you on iOS 6.1.3.\n", "Q: How to store password for Logical Volume in keychain?

The old phone had 500+ pics on it and was backed up to icloud. However, photostream is only syncing 100 photos onto the new phone. Please advise. \n\nA: Photostream is a funny one, I have spent some time looking at the workflow so I think I know what is happening here.\nWhen you take a picture with an iOS device (assuming wifi etc): \n\n\n*\n\n*It is uploaded to the iCloud.\n\n*It is stored there for 30 days.\n\n*During those 30 days it will be pushed to other photostream devices (iOS, OS X).\n\n*After 30 days it is 'purged' (deleted) from the iCloud servers.\nSome points to note:\nAlthough it is purged from iClouds servers it will STILL appear in the photostream album on your iPhone.\nThus take this example:\nIf I take 50 pictures on my iPhone 2 months ago, and 2 new photos today. and then bought a Brand new iPhone and signed into iCloud the following would happen,\nOn my original iPhone the photostream album would have 52 photos.\nOn my new iPhone only the 2 photos taken within the last month would push down to the phone.\nSome extra points.\n\n\n*\n\n*I guess this is why Apple says photostream doesn't count towards iCloud storage! They only store items for 30 days.\n\n*Although photos may no longer be in the cloud devices still sync - ie if you delete an old photostream photo (older than 30 days) on your iPhone it will delete on any other device that it synced to during the original 30 day period.\n\n*iOS only holds your last 1000 photos in it's Photostream album, to keep a photo forever you must save to camera roll, OS X (iPhoto, Aperture) holds them all.\n\n*A nice example of this behaviour was when I first got Aperture on my mac, I couldn't understand why so many of the photos in my iPhones 'Photostream' album were not syncing across, check the dates on the photos and you will see!\nFinally You can manually add photos from iPhoto, Aperture, or the Windows desktop to your photo stream. You may want to do this if you’d like to add photos that don’t appear in your photo stream automatically. \nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/PH2606\nAdditionally, after you asked this question, Apple has documented some of the photo stream limits, but you should be well under the volume of photos that would be capped to enter the stream assuming they were all recent photos and no device exchange in the middle.\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/HT4858\n", "Q: Sent iMessages never get delivered I have an iPad 2 and something weird is happening with iMessage.

She's moving to Hong Kong and I want to keep in touch but all she has is an iPad mini. I'm not even sure if she gets my FaceTime either.\n\nA: iCloud is having some iMessage issues as of late. I've had the same problem. It does eventually work itself out as Apple is aware and addressing it. However, at the moment they're stating all their services are up. \ncheck here if you're curious\nhttps://www.apple.com/support/systemstatus/\nI disabled iMessage/iCloud on all my devices (and my fiancé's [compare to you and your friend]) and then re enabled and it started working again.

I was wondering how I can copy this to my hard-drive, so I can play it whenever I want. I tried the disk utility and copy the disk to an image, but that only copied the files and folders, thus not making it playable as a videofile.\n\nA: My presumption is that when you burned the DVD using iMovie - it was encoded within a VIDEO_TS folder and you will need some software to move the video and sound files (which are hidden and obscured on the filesystem) back into a format that can be played on your Mac and/or burned back to a fresh optical drive.\nDepending on the version of software that wrote the DVD to disc, you might be able to locate the raw video files (or find them on a backup). Barring that, using Disk Utility to simply clone the volume onto a new drive isn't a good choice, but I've had great luck with programs like the little app factory's RipIt.\n", "Q: Logging out and in on OS X takes 4-5 minutes?

I know this amount of RAM is \"officially unsupported\" which is why I mention it.\nLately logging out (to restart into boot camp) takes 4 or 5 minutes, and logging back in does as well. When logging out, the Finder disappears and it goes to the gray screen that you see just before it restarts... but then sits there for 4-5 minutes. When logging in, you see the \"enter user name / password\" screen with the spinning progress indicator... which again takes 4-5 minutes.\nIs it copying all 24GB of RAM to disk, and restoring it, to re-open windows in saved states or something like that?

In time my photo collection grew bigger and bigger and since Photostream just dumps everything into one folder I'm looking for a tool that would automatically sort the entire collection into folders using this format:\nYYYY-MM-GEOLOCATION\n\nexample:\n2013-05-Rome\n\nwhere GEOLOCATION is either the city or the region where the photo was taken. this can be gathered from the GPS information in the EXIF data of each image (just like the Places function in the Photos app on iPhone)\n\n\nI'm looking for a tool that would:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a folder structure as described above\n\n*Move photos to their respective folders based on date and Geo-location information\n\n\nI have found AmoK Exif Sorter but it can't interpret the GPS information in the photos. Do you know a tool that can help me do that.\n\nA: Answer #1  Requires script writting, exiftool, and the creation of a places database.\nA partial answer would use a script and exif tool.\nExiftool can read both the exif and IPTC as well as most other metadata in an image.  Geolocation is part of the data it can read.\nSo if your photostream is in folder ~/PhotoStream  (I've no idea where you keep it.)\nforeach photo in ~/Photostream {\n  (year,month,lat,long) = exiftool {bunch of flags} photo\n  foreach placename in ~/Placenames {\n    # Place name has lat, long, name, radius\n    # Calculate angular distance from present lat/long to each placename\n    distance = sqrt((picture_lat - place_lat)^2 + (picture_long - place_long)^2)\n    if (distance < place_radius) { # found one!\n      if not exists directory year-month-placename {mkdir MyPics/year-month-placename\n      move file year-month-placename\n    }\n}\n\nThe problem with general sorting for geographical data is that it is intrinsically two dimensional.  If you sort just by lat, you end up with New York City being adjacent to Rome.  \nThe script above while not enormously difficult will take some time to get working right, mostly due to the place names.\nAnswer #2 Sort into folders by date, and add places manually.\nI would suggest that unless your place names are fine enough grained that they change multiple times in a day.  (E.g. you have separate entries for your hotel, the temples, the coliseum...) that doing a first bin by date, then rename the resulting folders manually.\nI recently went through my aperture file (15000 images) and essentially did this by hand.  Few of these pics have geolocation info.\nA:  Renamed each image in the format yyyy-mm-dd hh-mm-ss.  Aperture can do this automatically.\nB:  Make a batch of year folders. Made a project in each one called 'unsorted'\nc:  Manually moved each year's pix into year folders/unsorted.\nd: Make a batch of month projects in each year folder.\ne: Move the pix from unsorted into appropriate month folder.\nf: In some cases I would make a special project yyyy-mm-project_name where I had a large number of photos dealing with a single topic.\nThis didn't take as long as it sounds.  \nMuch longer was going through each folder and applying keywords.  Well worth doing.\n", "Q: Can one Mac mini run twelve displays? At work we have two Mac minis and each can run six monitors (twelve total).\nI want to use only one Mac mini. How can we do this?\nUpdate:\nWe have tried using a Thunderbolt PCIe expansion chassis.\nWe discovered some limitations of OS X and Thunderbolt.\nThunderbolt Expansion Chassis: Graphics Cards - FAIL\nMac OS X does not yet support video pass through. We tried multi-channel graphics card in a three-bay PCIe expansion chassis. FAIL. So not all graphics cards will work. When talking to Magna we learned that this is supported in Windows, but not Mac OS X. Maybe WWDC will announce further functionality from an OS end.\nThunderbolt Expansion Chassis: USB Graphics - FAIL\nUtilize more USB graphics cards with USB 3 capable PCIe Cards. We discovered that the USB 3 PCIe cards developed by CalDigit does not support anything but hard drives. They said they will support a more full USB 3 spec in a couple of months when their next release comes out, but didn’t guarantee USB graphics cards.\nUSB Graphics Cards: Partial Success\nUSB graphics card makers are advertising the support of six USB graphics cards on one computer. Add HDMI and Thunderbolt. That makes eight displays from a Mac mini.\nWhy?\nBecause it is there.\nBecause the cost is right.\nIt is cool.\nHopefully a replacement for the linear processing of information like unto a PowerPoint presentation.\nWhat?\n\n\n*\n\n*Twelve 1080p LED monitors\n\n*Two Mac minis\n\n*FileMaker Pro\n\n*Eight USB-to-DVI dongles\n\n*Two HDMI ports\n\n*Two Thunderbolt ports\n\n\nA: Not if you’re trying to do something different on each display.\nIf you’re just looking to mirror the same content on twelve displays, then it should be okay: you just need a bunch of DVI splitters such as this one on Amazon.\nTo elaborate somewhat: the Mac mini is probably the least powerful Mac you can buy today (putting aside refurb models). It only has an integrated graphics processor, and while the Intel HD Graphics 4000 is better than some of the graphics cards Apple has used in the past, it’s still no substitute for a proper graphics card.\nIf we look at the Mac Pro tech specs page:\n\nSupport for up to six displays\nConnecting more than three displays requires installation of two ATI Radeon HD 5770 graphics cards.\n\nEven though it hasn’t been updated properly in several years, the Mac Pro still outstrips the Mac mini considerably. You might be able to fiddle it somewhat and get an extra display or too on top of what Apple cite, but I think twelve would be a struggle on a Mac Pro. Doing it on a mini is probably impossible.\nAnother comparison: the Verge tested a Retina MacBook Pro, and were able to drive three external displays with it (four total). That’s one of Apple’s most modern Macs, and it was struggling:\n\nThere’s certainly a performance hit overall, and when trying to play four separate videos at once on all four displays (one of which was the 4K footage), we did notice the frame rates begin to drop.\n\nNote that three external displays is more than Apple specifies for that machine. (Two running at 2560 by 1600 pixels.)\nDriving twelve individual displays on a Mac mini is almost certainly impossible. I would guess that you probably can’t get a Mac from Apple today that will do it, even with a lot of work.\nYou can add graphics processing power, but eventually it won’t be your graphics that are the bottleneck. Trying to draw windows across twelve 1080p displays (nearly 25 million pixels) will strain what the window drawing tools in OS X are capable of. I suspect memory and CPU power would rein you in.\n(That’s not to say that you can’t get computers that will drive twelve displays: you can buy such machines for trading floors, or maybe build a Hackintosh that will do it, but I’m fairly sure Apple don’t cater to that market.)\nAlso, what on earth are you trying to drive twelve displays from a single Mac mini for? If you really need to drive twelve displays, you need to buy several machines.\n\nA: There is no way to get a Mac Mini to run this many displays, I'm sorry to say. My brand new MacBook Pro has trouble running more than two at full resolution, and the Mac Mini is a low power machine by all accounts. On top of that, you take a huge performance hit every time you connect a monitor, even more so when you use a DisplayLink (USB video adapter), which is what I'm assuming you're using. If you wanted to try a Mac Pro with a few beefy graphics cards, you might get 12 displays out of it, but I'm seriously questioning why on Earth you would need 12 individual displays unless they're all displaying the same thing. If that is the case, there's no problem at all, but then you need to be more clear in your question.\n\nA: In the simple case, you could get a DVI signal splitter and run the same presentation on hundreds of displays (think like a warehouse TV retailer needing to have 100 TV running from one input playing their demo loop). \nAssuming you actually need to control each display as a desktop that the OS can control, most people end up finding that RAM and the GPU on whatever computer you use is the limiting factor and not the physical dongles and USB video out devices that act as alternate screens.\nSince you have 8 USB to DVI dongles, it should be trivial in time and cost to get a USB hub and see what happens when you try 12 of these to see whether the GPU+RAM lags to the point of disfunction before adding anoer piece of hardware breaks down that chain to add a new display to the OS. \nMy experience is you will want to get a proper display wall solution for this sort of one computer and many display setup since they almost never are a situation where you want to mirror the exact same image on all 12 displays. \nI've had good luck with Barco solutions, but they are pricey. \n", "Q: How can I turn on my iPhone using assistive touch? How do I turn on an iPhone back after turning it off using assistive touch? My lock button on the top is broken so I have no other way of turning on my iPhone.\n\n\nA: By default, charging will turn the phone on. You can try charging the phone. \n\nA: You can do as revolver said but if both your home button and lock button are not working anymore, you can goto Settings > General > Auto-Lock and turn it to never which will never dim your display and thus locking it will not turn off your screen.\nSome problems with this however is it will drain battery power, probably isn't good for hardware and the screens always on, glowing jeans :)\nIf you really wanted to goto the hassle of doing so, you can turn your brightness way down and turning back up when in use which will be alot safer.\n", "Q: What is best way to get and play Age of Mythology on Mac? I have a 15 inch 1st gen MacBook Pro retina with windows 7 installed using boot camp and I would like to get the game Age of Mythology (with expansion) which I never had. What would be the best way to get the game and play it? For example, would it be best/possible to buy the windows version and play it on the 64 bit window 7 portion of my computer.\nNote: Not sure if this question is better in Ask Different or Arqade. Will move question if prompted.\nThanks ahead of time for any advice.\nUPDATE\nI would like to get the game at a reduced price since it is so old so paying the full price for the OS X version is not preferred but will be considered.\nUPDATE\nAnd I would like the Titans expansion too.\n\nA: I would try PlayOnMac, it's an easy-to-use wrapper for a program called WINE which basically replicates all the Windows code a normal win32 application needs to run. They have a database on their website of games that work on it, you might try there.\n\nA: That game is available on Windows and OS X - you can buy either the windows or os x version and use either, I would suggest OS X if you'd prefer not to have to boot windows to play it. Your machine will be fine to play it!\nHowever if you want absolutely the best framerates windows tends to be faster for games.\n\nA: I ended up being patient and did not make any purchases until recently when Age of Mythology: Extended Edition was released on Steam. It includes the Titans expansion and is likely to have more content added like what was done for Age of Empires II on Steam.\nI do have to boot into Windows to play but it runs really well (graphics look awesome) through Steam.\n", "Q: One mini displayport on Radeon HD5870 not working after an OS reinstall; why? (Mac Pro) I've searched in every way I can think, and read forums until my eyes bug out, and have yet to run into my situation, so here goes. I have a very nice Mac Pro that I purchased pre-owned (8 cores, 32GB of RAM, super clean, inside and out). It was loaded with OS 10.8.2, placed on a SSD system/boot drive. In order to \"clean house,\" I did a fresh install with the disks that came with, which ran 10.5.6.\nThe reinstall went great, and cleared some space, but I found that my second of two mini-displayport monitors (Dell P2210s) was not working. I upgraded to Snow Leopard, and it STILL isn't showing up. I know that the monitors and cables are good, because they work when I plug them into the right-most mini-displayport output on the ATI Radeon HD 5870 video card installed in the unit.\nNeedless to say, both monitors worked fine when I received the unit. I can see the \"Detect Display\" button on my \"Preferences\"/\"Display\" menu, but that does no good. I've reset my SRAM, tried hot-swapping and cold-swapping the monitor in the left-most output, and have had no results. My next step is to try using a DVI-D cable and see if it recognizes, but has anyone out there ever heard of a displayport output just going kablooey for no other reason than having done a fresh install of the OS?\nThe bottom line is that the right mini-displayport output on the video card works great, and the left one does not, anymore.\nI tried unplugging the power cables from the video card and re-plugging them, but, just to clarify, everything worked just fine, out of the box--both monitors were immediately recognized, and easily configured. There were no shocks, no traumas, no dropped CPU, nothing that would be an obvious cause to the problem.\nThanks in advance for any help; I'll post here if I come up with a solution...\n\nA: I've not had your issue exactly, BUT I've found DVI connection to be the most reliable with external monitors and OS X.  AS you said, you intended to try DVI-D next.  I imagine that would get both monitors firing up.\nSide note: OS X 10.8 seems to despise 10.5.  I've had a bunch of unrelated madness crop up due to failed mountain lion install and then recovery via  at some point using 10.5 install disc.  Disastrous results. \n", "Q: iPhone 4 movies won't play in Quicktime, no sound in VLC I've taken many videos with my iPhone 4, but when I uploaded them to my Macbook and try to  play them in Quicktime, they only show one frame and they don't play.  \nWhen I try to play with in VLC, they play but without sound and with improper orientation (portrait video is played in landscape mode).\nThese videos play just fine on the phone.  What do I need to do to get proper playback on my laptop?\n\nA: I had the same (or at least similar) issue: A video taken with my iPhone 4S (running the most up-to-date iOS 6) would not play in Quicktime player, but it DID play in the Finder preview, surprisingly. I finally figured out what I did wrong: I first downloaded all of my \"Camera Roll\" to my Mac in iPhoto, then exported the files from there to a Finder folder. However, I didn't pay attention that the default export file type is .jpg - which is obviously not the right one for a video. So I went into iPhoto again, selected the movie file, chose \"Export\" and then selected \"Original\" instead of \"JPEG\" from the \"Kind:\" pull-down menu. (Stupidly, iPhoto reverts back to \"JPEG\" the next time you open it - why? Also, why is there no easier way to download picture and movie files from the iPhone to the Mac than the route I just described? But this is besides the point of this discussion...)\nAnyway, now the video plays in all the right ways as intended. - might be something to try?\n", "Q: Is there a way to unlock a password protected iPad? A friend's father died a couple of weeks ago. He usually used the same numeric password on all devices. But not on his iPad. I can't even reproduce the password via the fingerprints. The lock time is already at 60 minutes. Is there some kind of an exploit or process at Apple which can help us to retrieve the information from the iDevice or is a full reset the only way to use it?\nPS\nThis isn't a question about morals or ethics. The friend has reasons to try to recover the data. The loss of her father left a million questions open and she thinks there might be answers in his personal data.\nI appreciate any answer, but please, don't judge over a fate or a question, before you are sure what the reasons may be.\n\nA: I'm not sure a general answer can be given with the lack of details in this specific case, but like any data recovery situation, it pays to stop and get some professional help to at least understand your options.\n\n\n*\n\n*How valuable is the data? Give an order of magnitude guess. $10, $100, $1000, $10,000, or more? The solutions for each involve different timescales and tools.\n\n*STOP trying to guess the passcode - it could have a 10 guess and the iPad erases itself trigger set. The trigger could even be less than 10 incorrect guesses. Your next attempt to unlock it could be your last chance to save the contents.\n\n*What else is available? In almost all cases, a computer exists that will unlock each iOS device - so rather than trying to guess the passcode - see if you can locate that computer instead.\n\n\nHere are support articles that should help anyone in this situation:\n\n\n*\n\n*iOS: Understanding passcodes  - http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4113\n\n*iOS: Forgotten passcode or device disabled after entering wrong passcode  - http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1212\n\n*iCloud: Find My iPhone overview - http://support.apple.com/kb/PH2696\nOnce you realize that time is on your side and that the system is designed to not be compromised by someone that finds the device, your chance of success will increase with the added care you bring to the task. That design notwithstanding, there are often circumstances when a passcode gets forgotten or not handed to the device's current owner and you have a few avenues to get the passcode reset or bypassed without erasing the device's contents whether you try to crack the PIN with a tool or work around the security by locating the computer that can unlock the device for you.\n\nA: Apple provides access to law enforcement with a warrant. This access is typically done through password guessing in a manner that does not risk resetting the iPad. I do not know if Apple will provide this service in the situation that you describe, but it's possible that they will if they are contacted by an attorney or ordered to do so by a court (for example, if there is material on the iPad that is required for probate.)\nWhat do you hope to find on the iPad? Most information on the iPad is simply a copy of what is in cloud-based services, and you can usually get access to those directly.\nAnother option that you have is to go after the backup. This is a useful option if the iPad was synched with a desktop. Frequently the backup can be accessed directly (if it is not encrypted).\nFinally, if it is an iPad 1 or 2 the security is not as strong as on an iPad 3. You may be able to get a computer forensics professional to get you access. Many investigators have such services available. You may be able to get the iPad opened for a few hundred dollars.\n\nA: you can probably be hopeless now... sorry for ya but if he updated it to IOS7 you are in really big trouble. \ntry doing this: hold down the close button until you see the slider, dont slide it. then close your smart cover. open and press cancel\n", "Q: Launchd - Run as if you're logged in as a user using sudo Is there a way to do this?\nBasically I'm trying to run a script that needs to launch a program.\nPutting the script in /Library/LaunchDaemons works fine, but everything gets run as if its the root user. This doesn't work because it needs to run as if its a real user, but using the sudo command.\nSo I moved the script to ~/Library/LaunchDaemons but now it won't launch the program, presumably because its getting run as the user and not with sudo permissions.\nSo I'm stuck. Logging in as the user and going to a terminal and running:\nsudo my_command_which_launches_a_program\n\nWorks absolutely fine, and exactly how its meant to work. So I want to basically emulate that, but in a Launchd script, if possible.\nThanks\n\nA: \nit needs to run as if its a real user, but using the sudo command\n\nI think this belies a false assumption you are making. When a user runs sudo foobar, then the foobar command is run by the root user.\nThe only things that can be different when running foobar as root (instead of the user running sudo foobar) are the shell and environment variables available such as $HOME or $PATH.\nIf your application requires a specific shell or environment variable, just ensure that that shell or environment variable is set by the LaunchDaemon you are creating. That will save you a lot of heartache over trying to get launchd to replicate the exact experience of a specific user running sudo foobar.\nTo those downvoting, this information is backed up multiple times on StackExchange here, here, and here for starters.\n\nA: You put the plist into /Library/LaunchDaemons but edit it to say which user the script will run as\nThe key you need to add is UserName. For example I run a newserver as user _news\n<key>UserName</key>\n<string>_news</string>\n\nDocumented in Apple's launchd man page\n", "Q: some system binaries are lost After installing some RAM my macbook pro would not start,\ndiskutil showed HDD failure.\nBooting in single user mode and running fsck several times to repair the disk lead to a running system.\nBut now, some of the Unix binaries (as well as some data) - like rm and less - are missing.\nI have copied them from another mac.\nThe question is: if I reinstall OSX will it also install those and any other that might be missing?\n\nA: If you mean doing an upgrade install from the recovery partition, it does replace many system files with the initial versions. It might not replace all files though, and for example setting or cache files might also be corrupted.\nIf you have backups, it won't take that long to try it out and see if there are still things that don't work. I'd just erase and reinstall OS X though.\n", "Q: How to open a Finder window even if one is open on a different space already, in Terminal? I often use open . to open the current folder from Terminal.app. From time to time this doesn't work. The reason is that the folder in question is already open in some other Finder window on some other Space.\nHunting down this Finder window by searching all spaces takes too long. Neither do I really want to go a different space. I just want to open a new Finder window right there on the current space, regardless of other Finder windows open anywhere else.\nI tried open -n . but this just hangs.\n\nA: You might use a script like this:\n#!/usr/bin/osascript\n\ntell application \"Finder\"\n    make new Finder window to POSIX file (system attribute \"PWD\")\n    activate\nend tell\n\nThe script above always creates a new window.

I have just bought a 2560 x 1440 monitor for my macbook pro. I've tried the mini DisplayPort to DVI and the mini DisplayPort to HDMI cables to connect to the display but both will only push 1080p to the monitor. Will a mini DisplayPort to DisplayPort cable run the resolution or do I need the dual link DVI adapter?\n\nA: Mini Displayport to Displayport is the best solution, provided your monitor has a Displayport input. A mini Displayport to Dual-link DVI adapter is also a possibility, but those tend to be expensive and not always reliable. If Displayport is an option, go with that.\n\nA: I had issues trying to use a HP Z30i with 2560 x 1600 resolution.\nThe only way to drive it at full resolution was with Apple's\nMini DisplayPort to Dual-Link DVI Adapter\nhttp://store.apple.com/us/product/MB571Z/A/mini-displayport-to-dual-link-dvi-adapter\nOther approaches (HDMI, Mini DisplayPort to DisplayPort,\nand Mini DisplayPort to DVI) only provided lower resolution\n(1920 x 1200).\n", "Q: iPhone doesn't show location in certain apps My iPhone 4 has several apps that I use location services on.

Well designed. \n", "Q: Any way to \"right-click->open\" application using application launcher or AppleScript? I'm an avid launch service (Quicksilver/Launchbar) user, and have been frequently stymied by Gatekeeper… The default \"Open\" actions behave like double-clicking an application package, which is insufficient for triggering the dialogue for circumventing Gatekeeper. I used to get around this by asking the respective launcher to \"Reveal\" the app, and then right clicked it from Finder.\nI recently installed Path Finder 6 on my machine to replace Finder/TotalFinder. The problem is, there isn't a way to trigger the \"open\" right-click action from Path Finder that allows one to circumvent the Gatekeeper block for unsigned applications… So now I have to \"Reveal\" from QS, and then \"Show in Finder\" from Path Finder. The ideal situation would just be to figure out exactly what command is being called when you right-click->Open, and implement that as an action in QS or Launchbar… an Apple- or shell-script would be ideal, but I can't figure out what the system command is for that higher level \"Open\". \nAny experience with this out there?\n\nA: You could create an Automator service with a Run Shell Script action like this:\nfor f; do\n  q=$(xattr -p com.apple.quarantine \"$f\" 2> /dev/null)\n  if [[ $q ]]; then\n    xattr -d com.apple.quarantine \"$f\"\n    open \"$f\"\n    xattr -w com.apple.quarantine \"$q\" \"$f\"\n  else\n    open \"$f\"\n  fi\ndone\n\nSet the input type to files or folders (just folders doesn't seem to include application bundles) and set \"pass input\" to \"as arguments\".\nOr in Alfred 2 you could add a File Action trigger and connect it to a Run Script action like this:\nf=\"{query}\"\nq=$(xattr -p com.apple.quarantine \"$f\" 2> /dev/null)\nif [[ $q ]]; then\n  xattr -d com.apple.quarantine \"$f\"\n  open \"$f\"\n  xattr -w com.apple.quarantine \"$q\" \"$f\"\nelse\n  open \"$f\"\nfi\n\nIf you want to keep Gatekeeper enabled but make it ignore some applications, just run something like xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /Applications/SomeApp.app.\n\nA: I've discovered how to get halfway there… It appears that PathFinder does have an \"Open\" option, and it just has to be enabled in the preferences under the Features -> Contextual Menu tab. So now I just end up with the QS -> \"Reveal\", and then right-click -> \"Open\" in PathFinder. \n", "Q: I want to play my guitar via iRig through my computer with my iPhone 4 I want to play my guitar via iRig through my computer with my iPhone 4. The earphones are uncomfortable, and the wires keep tangling with the guitar. I've connected my iPhone to the computer, but what do I do now?\n\nA: If you absolutely postively must play it through your computer (see below for better options), you could try installing XBMC on your computer and using AirPlay off your iPhone to play through your computer speakers.\nBetter options: attach the speakers on your computer (if you have external speakers) to the headphone jack; get a 1/4 inch to 1/8 inch adapter and plug it into the microphone port on your computer, then pirate acquire Ableton Live; get a decent audio interface for your computer, you'll get way better sound out of it.\n\nA: In addition, take a look at Airfoil.  it allows streaming wireless audio from a mac to a phone and vice versa.  It supports any application, including Ableton.  And has some advanced options for MIDI mapping etc. You'd need Airoil and Airfoil speakers on your computer.

The mouse still moves just none of the apps respond. This is especially strange since I have the sandybridge with 16gbs RAM. I would like to try to go and kill an emulator I am running to fix the issue, in Linux I would do this with ctrl+alt+fx to get to a terminal and type my kill command. This doesn't appear to work in OSX, is there another option?\n\nA: There are no virtual consoles like in Linux; there is no way to interact with the system using the connected keyboard/mouse/display outside of the regular GUI which you have already found to be unresponsive.\n\n\n*\n\n*To bail out with a minimum of needed interaction, there is a shortcut to kill the frontmost application directly: ⌥⇧⌘⎋, Command-Option-Shift-Escape. This is precisely the same action as the usual Force Quit dialog, except that it does not ask you to choose an application.\n(Tip: If you press modifier keys while a menu is open, in this case press Shift while the Apple menu is open, shortcut variants like this one will be displayed.)\n\n*If you have another machine or even a phone around, another thing you can do is connect via SSH (turn on Remote Login in Sharing preferences) and use that to kill the runaway process. However, if your runaway program is hogging the RAM then I recommend you SSH in before you start work, as making a new SSH connection while the system is stuck in swapping will be just as sluggish, but using an existing connection is less problematic.\n(Note that in the unfortunate case where your OpenGL program is hitting glitches in the graphics driver, as opposed to merely consuming resources itself, you may find that the system continues to be unusable even after your process exits, since the entire GUI rendering is based on hardware-accelerated graphics processing.)\n\nA: i have never used Linux.. but alt + cmd + esc will open up force quit which will allow you to force quit an application. You can also do cmd+ [space] to open Spotlight and then you can open any app, including terminal.\n", "Q: iPhone drive removed upon installing iTunes When iTunes is installed my iPhone does not appear as a drive in Windows Explorer.\nWhen iTunes is removed, the iPhone does appear as a drive.\nI use Windows 7 64bit\nI would like to have iTunes to backup locally and have iPhone as a drive so I can download pictures from it.\nHow can I have both?\nThis may or may not be related to the following error I get after installing iTunes and attaching+detaching my iPhone via USB:\n\n\nA: Do you have any images in your camera roll?

I accidentally erased a mail and then did a search for it and it came up under All mail?\n\nA: \"All Mail\" in apple mail basically is just what it sounds like: a catch-all for everything on your e-mail account. I believe it does include your trash, but not your spam folder. That might be why it included an \"erased\" message.\n\nA: This is a setting under Mail's preferences, under the first pane, General: \n\"When searching all mailboxes, include results from:\n         ▢ Trash\n         ▢ Junk\n         ▢ Encrypted Messages \"    \nTip: Spotlight makes a hell of a lot faster and cooler messages search than that little box in Mail and its wretched chiclets.

Will I be able to detect a difference between \"Power Nap mode\" and just plain \"having the screen off\"? \n\nA: You will not be able to connect to your Mac without waking it up. Modern Macs can be accessed remotely without needing to power on the display; this behaviour saves energy but is not Power Nap.\nApple's Power Nap technical note describes what the state is and how it affects your Mac.\nPower Nap does not leave your Mac in a generally usable state; only specifically designed processes are permitted during the power nap state.

The ones I can remember trying are:\n$HOME = /directroy\n$HOME = \"/directroy\"\nsetenv HOME /directory\n\nI may be missing something simple but I'm unable to find a solution.\n\nA: In bash (the default shell of Terminal on 10.8) the syntax:\nHOME=/your/path\nexport HOME\n\n\nA: Expanding on @patrix comment, change your $HOME/.bash_profile file to add the following lines:\nMYROOT=/path/to/dir/you/want\nexport MYROOT\ncd $MYROOT\n\nThis way you will get you will start your shell in /path/to/dir/you/want and using cd $MYROOT will bring you back there.\n", "Q: Disallow wiping via Profile Manager Is it possible to prevent end users from remotely wiping their iPad in Apple Profile Manager?\nI work at a school and I can foresee kids managing to steal each others passwords and remote wiping their iPad.\n\nA: Profile Manager has since been updated to allow the prevention of device wiping by users.\n", "Q: Full-screen apps and desktop arrangements \nThe picture above is a screenshot from Mission Control showing the desktop and full-screen apps. The problem is that I want a different arrangement. I want the order to be Safari-Desktop-iTunes. I can't drag the desktop between Safari and iTunes apps, and when I drag Safari to the left of the Desktop, it goes back to its original place. So how can I modify the place of the Desktop? (I want to use only one Desktop, I know that it is possible when other Desktops are added) By the way I'm using Mountain Lion.\n\nA: As far as I know, mission control is set up in such a way that the dashboard and the first desktop are immutable (i.e. cannot be changed). There might be a flag or something for it somewhere that you could disable that behaviour, but it would definitely require some serious digging since it's part of how mission control is written.\n", "Q: How to \"merge\" my Messages transcripts in OSX? EDIT:  Perhaps a better way to say all of the below, is this:  Is there a way to restore my Message (iChat) history onto my iMac, from my iCloud backup?  All of my iDevices have the complete chat history, so this seems reasonable.\nOriginal post follows...\nMy system got into a very weird state today, so I decided the best option was to restore to a new HD from a Time Machine backup.  The last backup I had was from a month ago, but it restored fine.\nNow I have my new HD with 1-month old data, and my old HD with current data that I want to recover parts of.\nI found today's messages transcripts in ~/Library/Messages/Archive and I can view them just fine.  But even after I added today's folder to my live Archive folder on the boot drive, Messages will not see the current chats at all.\nHow can I \"import\" or \"merge\" or otherwise get my latest Messages transcripts to be blended in with the old ones?\n\nA: How about restoring from your backup just the Messages Archive folder contents? (Open that folder in the Finder; then choose \"Enter Time Machine\" from the Time Machine menu in the Menu Bar; then select the most recent backup that has your full Messages history.) On restore, if anything presently in that folder has the same name, you'll be offered the choice to keep old/new/both.\nRelatedly, check out this answer:\nhttps://apple.stackexchange.com/a/117558/10581\n\nAs far as merging goes, there are two ways: in the Finder, or in the Terminal. Both of these would require restoring your Time Machine backup of ~/Library/Messages/Archive to another, temporary location.\n\nThe Finder method is done by holding the Option key while dragging things to a location containing other things of the same name(s). If the destination contains items with the same name(s) as what is being dragged, it'll offer an option to Merge. But if what is being dragged contains items that are older than those in the destination, no Merge option will be offered.\nThe Terminal method is to use a command-line tool called ditto. This is something like using the command cp (to copy items), but it will automatically merge if there are name conflicts.\n", "Q: Web-based wireless login: remember password When connecting to some wireless networks, the first webpage that I try to load redirects to a login screen.  It becomes possible to access the internet only after logging in.  I'm sure most people here are familiar with the situation.\nIt seems that OS X is smart about this and it brings up this login screen in a separate window as soon as I connect to the wireless network.  I don't need to open a browser and log in separately.  The system show me the login page as soon as I connect to the network, which is quite convenient.\nQuestion: is it possible to coerce this special window to remember the username and password, like browsers are able to?\n\nA: The special window is an instance of Safari, just without all the navigation bits.\nWhy don't you try copy-pasting the URL of the login screen to your browser, typing in your password, and telling safari you want to save it when it asks?\n", "Q: Can multiple accounts use same Dropbox, with access control There are 7-8 different user of my Dropbox account. we are using the single account in all PC's. I want: \n- Certain users not to view few files.\n- Certain Users should not be able to edit few files.\n- Only few Users should be able to delete a file or can we check which user or PC deleted a specific file\nPlease suggest if this can be done on any file sharing software or sky drive etc?\n\nA: Since you came here to ask this, I'll volunteer that a Mac with OS X and Server configured would host files exactly as you wish. Some users could have read/write access and others read only. You could further restrict shares, folders or files with ACL so that arbitrary files are hidden from all but users that are supposed to see the files.\nYou might also be able to get dropbox group software or Microsoft skydive to do similar, but we're not the best place for that support or answer.\n", "Q: How to troubleshoot WLAN WPA2/WPA not working after updating to OSX 10.8.4? I've tried to update my macbook pro to osx 10.8.4. While my macbook rebooted, it said, that the update failed. After this failed update, my Mac will no longer connect to my TL-WR841N router.\nI clicked the OK button and waited until it completely started. Then I tried to connect to my wlan (with no success). I got a \"Connection timeout.\". So I disabled/re-enabled my wlan, removed the wlan interface in the network panel, rebooted my macbook, added the network panel and got rid of the connection timeout. But it wasn't working: I got the error, that I couldn't connect to this network. I tried a lot: Repaired the access privileges in the utility program, changed my location in the network panel. I also reseted my router, but this was not the problem, because I could connect to it with my iphone without problems.\nThen I discovered that I can connect to every network that has no encryption or has WEP encryption. I changed my wlan security settings in my router to \"NO\" and \"WEP\" (just for testing) and I could connect. But when I change it to WPA or WPA2 I can not connect (Yes, the password is right)..\nWhat can I do now? How can I solve that? OSX 10.8.4 log says that it improves some points concerning wlan, so I think it has something to do with that. However beside the wlan my macbook is working great and (in contrast to the error message when updating), the \"About Mac\" panel says OSX 10.8.4.\n\nA: Since the update told you it failed, you might need to re-apply the update by connecting to a wired network or downloading the whole update from another computer if yours is off the network.\nBe sure to download the 10.8.4 Combo updater and re-apply the update to be sure the drivers all installed properly and no pieces of your software were missing or corrupted. Since normal updates are a delta (only the changed items get written), it's a slim chance that something odd happened and a re-install of the patch might help fix things up for you.\nOnce you've gotten the OS X update installed, should the problem persist, you can troubleshoot it as normal. The two avenues I would pursue to troubleshoot this would be to dig into Wireless Diagnostic first to see if it can identify your issue.\n\n\n*\n\n*/System/Library/CoreServices/Wireless Diagnostics.app\n\n\nThis tool is substantially better on 10.8.4 than it was on previous versions (when it was called Wi-Fi Diagnostics) and it has helped me solve several tricky network issues already.\nThe second would be to go into the Network preference pane and clear all known wireless network settings:\n\n\n*\n\n*Network Preference Pane\n\n*Wireless\n\n*Advanced\n\n*Delete all preferred networks\n\n*Then make a new \"test\" location and try re-joining the affected network (or joining another network to ensure this isn't just a coincident failure of the wireless card and not related to the update)\n\n\nA: i have the exact same problem except that the installation of 10.8.4 went fine. i also installed the combo to make sure. my MBA refuses to connect to any WPA2 router. I tried 3 different networks and it is always the same issue. When I remove WPA2, it connects fine. \n", "Q: Understanding install of mod_wsgi on apache terminal commands I'm installing a django development environment on OSX. Apache is, of course, installed by default. From my (very limited) understanding of Macs, I don't believe there is preconfigured functionality for interfacing python with apache in this default install (?). So, my first step is to install this interface, mod_wsgi, and I am following this person's tutorial on how to do that. He includes these terminal commands:\ncurl -o mod_wsgi.tgz http://modwsgi.googlecode.com/files/mod_wsgi-2.5.tar.gz\ntar -xzf mod_wsgi.tgz\ncd mod_wsgi-2.5\n./configure\nmake\nsudo make install\n\nI'm confused about these commands. I don't want to just type them and move on; I want to understand what's going on. Can someone explain to me what they mean? \n\nA: To do this you will need to install Xcode from App Store and then its command line tools from an option in Xcode as you need a development environment.\nIt might be easier to use a package manager like Macports or Homebrew after that to install apache and  mod_wsgi. the writers of the package will have sorted out any issues.\nI will explain the commands in the line after each one\ncurl -o mod_wsgi.tgz http://modwsgi.googlecode.com/files/mod_wsgi-2.5.tar.gz\n\nGet the source code from the given server. curl is a program that downloads via http. You could just enter the URL in your browser and download the file. The curl command puts the mod_wsgi.tgz in your current directory. \ntar -xzf mod_wsgi.tgz\n\nUntar the file - ie get all the individual files out of the package and put them in the correct subdirectories. If you had downloaded in your browser the default action would have down this unpack, or select this file in Finder and double click to extract.\ncd mod_wsgi-2.5\n\nChange directory into the top level of the source code. If you had used the browser in the first two steps then cd ~/Downloads/mod_wsgi-2.5\n./configure\n\nThe source code can be built for many versions of Unix, Linux and possible other operating systems. configure is a shell script that calls on certain programs in Xcode to generate the correct source code files so that this setup will build on OSX. The ./ is required as your current directory is not on your path.\nmake\n\nMake an executable and support files out of the source code. This will all be in or beneath your current directory. make is a program that does things based on a set of rules held in makefiles.\nsudo make install\n\nThis puts the executables in a directory that can be used by apache. make install uses the make program as above but with a command install to do something different (actually if you had not done make before it will also do the build as in the command above as that is defined as a dependency on the makefile but don't do this because of the sudo) sudo is a command that makes the rest of the line run as the root user, this is needed as you should not have permission to write to the directories the executables should end up in, this you need a special command to get that permission. Note that your user needs to be set up to use sudo, if you are an Administrator then that will be sufficient.\nThis should give you enough pointers to help you read up on anything that I have started to explain.\n", "Q: Is \"suspend-to-disk\" memory dump encrypted when using FileVault2? I am conserned about cold-boot attacks on my full disc encrypted (filevault2) laptop. \nTherefore I am wondering if the memory image dump to /var/vm/sleepimage is encrypted before it is saved to disk?\nI notice that the suspended drive asks me for my password before unlocking so it appears this is the case, but could anyone confirm this?\n\nA: Everything written to the volume under Filevault 2 is encrypted live and in-stream by the kernel / device drivers.\nAs long as there isn't a bug where data leaks to outside the core storage wrapper, you don't need to worry about someone analyzing the contents of your RAM by snooping the locked drive.\n", "Q: how to record video with mixture of line-in and out? I want to create a guitar video when I'm playing guitar simultaneously with a track playing. So I want to write mixture of line in and out. Is it possible in Photo Booth?

The other day it went south, with OSX telling me that it could not repair it and leaving it in read only mode. I was able to salvage everything on it.\nNow I reformatted it and it is happy again. Or is it?\nIs there a way that I can stress test it or otherwise assure that it is once again reliable or should I just throw it out?\n\nA: I would put the hard drive in your machine, burn a bootable live Ubuntu Linux CD, and then boot from the CD and run the Disk Utility program that comes with Ubuntu.  This will run the internal SMART self-tests which are a lot more thorough than what you get from Mac OS' Disk Utility.  Here's an excellent page explaining how.\nI'd be wary of a drive that seemed to fail once and then was reported OK by OS X Disk Utility.  What you want to look for is failed reads and/or writes, which indicate the disk is failing physically.  With what you know so far, you can't distinguish a hardware problem from a software one (i.e. the filesystem may have been corrupted and then repaired without any low-level failure on the disk, or a low-level failure may have precipitated filesystem problems).  The SMART status as reported by Linux will give you the straight dope.\n", "Q: File Vault 2 and ssh I am considering enabling File Vault 2 on my Macbook Pro, which frequently stays at work overnight, and which I often need to log into remotely using ssh.  What are the ramifications of using File Vault 2 for a machine that needs to receive ssh connections?  Specifically,\n\n\n*\n\n*Will I need to stay logged into my user account overnight, or will I still be able to sign out and leave the machine at the login screen when I leave?\n\n*Can the machine sleep without requiring keyboard authentication for File Vault 2 when it wakes up?  Right now, I allow the machine to sleep and utilize \"Wake for network access\".  Will this still be possible with File Vault 2 enabled, or will I need to prevent it from sleeping?\n(I'll note that I'm aware of the sudo fdesetup authrestart option to restart the machine from remote without physically being there, which is helpful only if these other issues are not a problem.)\n\nA: The only time the machine will need the filevault key to unlock is at boot, at all other times the system is effectively decrypted with the key in ram.\nAs soon as the machine powered off, it will be locked again.\nYou do not need to be logged in, and waking the machine up from sleep is no issue.\n\nA: With ssh you can remotely login: \n\n\n*\n\n*before a local login\n\n*after a local log out. \n\n\nIf you have the home directory on a volume that's separate from the startup volume. you could use Core Storage to encrypt only what's required (allow the Mac to restart without authentication). If you take this approach then you should be prepared to remotely unlock the volume with diskutil(8).\n", "Q: Confounded by permissions problem on NFS share I'm setting up an NFS server (Ubuntu) to serve files to several Macs (10.7).\nThe way it's set up, I can log in from any Linux client and read/write over NFS exactly as expected.

I have a file with a name such as \"Today's Date.txt\"\nWhat I am interested in is stripping away all special characters using the terminal  such as:\n\" - , ' ' [ \n\nThe reason for this is because I plug these into a script later and it is too much of a headache accounting for and changing the names individually. \nSpaces \" \" and Underscores \"_\" and the alphabet \"A-Z, a-z\" are ok and so is replacing the characters rather than erasing them.\nAt first I thought the terminal command \"iconv\" could help me by converting to a simpler encoding, but I tried out several of the encodings and it seems I might be mistaken.\nI know regular expressions might help me but sadly I am not well versed in them. I found this question that seems realated, but I dont know how to implement it or if it covers the same cases as mine.\nThe reason I posted this here is because this question might be unique to the character set OSX supports for filenames and the encoding it uses...although it's more likely I have no clue what I'm talking about.\nThank you for your help in advance.\nEdit: The command\nsed 's/[!@#\\$%^&*()]//g'\n\nSeems to work very well but I can't get it to work for my original usage case and others: \n' ` \"\n\nEscaping them doesnt work either.

The gsub function searches and replaces all occurrences of the regular expression you input. The gsub part would look like this:\ngsub(\"a\",\"b\")\n\nWhere in my example, all occurences of a would be replaced by b. Like in the comment above [[:punct:]] sounds like it stands for all punctuation marks. However, I do not know what the 1 on the outside of the brackets stands for.\n\nA: This would only replace single quotes with underscores:\nfor f in *; do mv \"$f\" \"${f//'/_}\"; done\n\nThis would only keep alphanumeric ASCII characters, underscores, and periods:\nfor f in *; do mv \"$f\" \"$(sed 's/[^0-9A-Za-z_.]/_/g' <<< \"$f\")\"; done\n\nLocales like en_US.UTF-8 use the ASCII collation order on OS X, but [[:alnum:]] and \\w also match characters like ä in them. If LC_CTYPE is C, multi-byte characters are replaced with multiple underscores.\n\nA: I recently had the same problem and had to strip the filenames of all files in a folder of special characters. I used this command, which is a combination of both answers posted here, but also keeps periods. Maybe it helps someone.\nfor file in *; do echo mv \"$file\" `echo $file | tr -cd 'A-Za-z0-9_.-'` ; done\n\nremoving the echo in front of mv \"$file\" executes the command.\n\nA: If you have a specific set of characters that you want to keep, tr works very well. \nFor example\ntr -cd 'A-Za-z0-9_-'\nWill remove any characters not in the set of characters listed.

I have an old game DVD (Chessmaster 9000) that I bought legit (I swear), and I would like to play it on my Mac Air, which has no optical drive. With another game (Civ V) I've had success data-dumping the DVD to an iso in linux, and then mounting the iso on the Mac Air.

I have a Macbook Pro which has a 750GB HDD. I'm currently using Bootcamp to run Win 7. If I want to upgrade the HDD to a SSD but keep my stuff from both the OS X side and the Win 7 side what are the steps to backing it up?\n\nA: Here's what I would do (haven't done it step by step, but I have fairly lot experience with swapping drives, making copies of partitions etc.):\n\n*\n\n*Ensure you have the necessary parts and tools. You’ll need an external USB enclosure to copy between the old and new drives, plus a couple of different screwdrivers. For a 2012 MacBook Pro, see these instructions.\n\n\n*Exchange the drives (put the SSD inside)\n\n\n*Place your old drive in the external USB enclosure\n\n\n*First test: power on with the Alt key pressed when it chimes, select the external OSX and see if you can boot OS X from the external drive (this should work).\nNote: you will not be able to boot your old Windows from the USB drive (booting Windows from USB is difficult/impossible and not covered here).\n\n\n*Boot into recovery mode. Access this by holding Command+R when turning on the machine until Apple logo appears.\n\n\n*Using Disk Utility, format your new drive. You may need to click View > Show All Devices to get the right drive/partition to show. Be sure to choose APFS for the file system if possible—this has much better support and performance for SSDs.\n\n\n*Install a fresh copy of OS X on the SSD.\n\n*\n\n*Ideally you should aim to install High Sierra or later which has support for Apple’s APFS file system—this has improved support for SSDs—although if you have an older Mac, consider whether it has the power to run a newer OS.\n\n*Even though you have a copy of OS X on your old drive, it appears you need an internet connection for this to occur. It may require a download of 5-10GB, so be prepared for this.\n\n*If your clock got reset when you were installing the SSD, you may get an error when attempting the OS X installation. In this case, you can try opening a terminal window and typing ntpdate -u time.apple.com which will sync your machine to the correct time over the internet.\n\n*Allow 30-90mins for the setup files to download, then another 30ish mins to install.\n\nIf you have a time machine backup you can alternatively restore that through the installer (in which case you can skip some of the installation process and the copying/migration-assistant step below) but you might not get the benefits of upgrading to APFS if your previous OS X used the HFS+ file system.\n\n\n*Now boot OS X from the internal SSD drive. It may ask you if you’d like to migrate all your apps and documents from your old drive, and you can generally choose “Yes”. Apple’s Migration tool is very robust and effective. A recent migration of mine took 2 hours for about 135GB of data.\n\n\n*Once you’re successfully booting OS X, eject and disconnect the USB drive to make sure bootcamp or Windows will not mess with it.\n\n\n*Run Bootcamp Assistant to make a suitably sized partition for Windows—at least 100GB is recommended. Note that Bootcamp Assistant will only work on an internal drive where your OS X install is the only single partition (plus recovery partition from the install).\nYou can optionally proceed with making a clean Windows install if you’d like to start fresh, or simply just to check that it boots OK. Otherwise continue with the cloning process below.\nThe point of the above is to create a partition layout on the SSD that both MacOS and Windows recognize.  The central thing there is, that bootcamp assitant will only let you do this from an original OS X partition layout.\nNow you should have an SSD with a fresh OS X and a partition for Windows.  Your other drive is still in the original state, so you can always put it back.\nIf you find that you are missing any apps or functionality from your previous OS X (this should be quite rare), then you can clone your OS X by booting from the external OS X again, then use SuperDuper (or a similar tool) to copy your current OS X to the SSD.  But in general, it’s best to boot the fresh OS X from the SSD and use the Migration Assistant and copy your setup from the external drive.\nTo clone your Windows partition from old to new drive:\nFor less-technical folks, consider using WinClone, which performs many of the following steps with less trouble (it could save you a couple hours, potentially), but it costs US$39.99.\nHere’s how to do it with free software:\n\n*\n\n*Download a copy of gparted. You can either get a copy that can be made into a bootable USB stick (recommended), or choose a i486 ISO and burn it on a CD.   This is a graphical tool which lets you modify/clone/resize partitions.\n\n\n*Boot from your newly created USB or CD (you can generally choose all the default menu options as it’s booting up) and run gparted.\n\n\n*Be very sure to identify which drive is your old and which is your new before proceeding. If you copy in the wrong direction you will permanently lose data.\n\n\n*Copy the old (external) Windows partition to the internal one. Select your external Windows partition, choose copy, then select SSD Windows partition, and choose paste, then click apply. This will perform a clone of the partition, copying only the parts of the partition containing data (it’s smart enough not to copy the empty space) and it will also automatically resize it to fit the size you specified in the Bootcamp Assistant earlier. This might take 30-60mins.\nSomething about using gparted or resizing the partition can cause issues with booting so if you cannot restart into Windows at this point, you may need to follow these additional steps to repair the Windows boot record. (Note: the following steps apply to Macs prior to 2014 that used the Legacy BIOS/MBR method of booting Windows. Since 2014, most Macs use a newer GPT/UEFI method, in which case the commands below might not apply.)\n\n\n*Disable Apple SIP by restarting into recovery mode (hold Command+R when restarting), open Terminal, and type:\ncsrutil disable\n\n\n\n*Reboot into OSX, install the gdisk command line tool, and use it to regenerate the hybrid GPT+MBR boot records. The instructions can get a bit long, so I suggest you read them here. If you are also booting Linux, you may need to ensure you include your Linux partition in the list of bootable partitions during the MBR creation step. (I’m only booting OSX + Windows so I cannot test this step with Linux.)\n\n\n*If Windows will still not boot (at this point I was seeing a blue screen of death with an error about winload.exe), you need to repair the boot files by booting to an installation disc/USB of the Windows version you have, then choose repair Windows installation. If the automated “Start-up Repair” option doesn’t work, you can try running these commands from the Windows installer command line:\nNote: first check that C:\\ is actually the correct drive that you intend to perform the repair on. Otherwise replace c: in the commands below with the relevant drive letter.\nbootsect /nt60 c: /mbr\nattrib  -r  -h  -s  c:\\boot\\bcd\ndel c:\\boot\\bcd\nbcdboot c:\\windows /s c: /f BIOS\n\nSource: https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/333605/30551\nAfter all that, you should have a functioning dual booting system. Remember to hold Option when turning on to choose your OS, or choose it from within OS X System Preferences > Startup Disk.\n\nA: I've done this a few times and WinClone is well worth the US$30. It's basically SuperDuper or CarbonCopyCloner for your Bootcamp partition.\n", "Q: Where can I find a comprehensive and detailed technical software manual for OS X?

I've got a bunch of Mac disk images (.dmg files) that are 100 GB or larger. I'm currently on an iMac with a few hundred gigabytes of free space, but I'm going to be moving to a Mac laptop with 128 GB storage.\nSo, I'm wondering, would that be a problem when I have less than 100 GB of free space on my computer, but I'm opening a disk image larger than 100 GB? My guess would be no, but is ANY space on the internal drive used at all when mounting an image? \nHow exactly does mounting an image work, does it just change the way the operating system sees the files as one file (the disk image) rather than the actual files within the disk image, until it is mounted? Therefore, no internal space is necessary for the mount operation?\nFollow-up question: Is it any slower to read from a DMG on an external drive than it is to read from any other files on the same external drive? Basically, is there any performance hit from having files in a DMG?\n\nA: There certainly isn't the same amount necessary as the DMG, so you sure can mount a 100GB DMG into a file system that has less (there will be trivial consumptions, maybe a few kb, but nothting that you'll notice).\nThe whole thing works in the way, that the system attaches a file-system driver to the file with the DMG.  The driver will present the DMG file to the system like an \"external\" drive and perform file requests on behalf of the system on the contents of the file.\nEssentially the driver will says to MacOS:  We have a new volume here. So MacOS will then ask the driver.  \"Give me a list of content in it\", and then the driver examines the inside of the file and presents the list of files organized inside the DMG.

So try the Safe mode and see if it happens.\n", "Q: Airport express and Airport utility I moved and had to change my network.\nAfter juggling for reconfiguring my airport express station, I found out it was impossible to connect to them, even after a factory reset : they just would NOT appear in the Airport Utility 6.2 program that is meant to manage those things.\nHowever, I could see all of them appear in the bonjour browser, so there is no network issues.\nFaced with that issue, I saw some other people could not either use their Airport Express anymore. I am now using the old utility as they are, which necessitates a hack, but works perfectly.\nHowever, I still don't understand if there are anything we are doing wrong.\nThat seems wrong that Apple gave no way to use its product.\nHas anyone be able to manage its airport express with standard Apple program ? \nI dont understand the rationale of what happens and must be missing some information..\n\nA: Download the Lion version 5.6 of Airport Utility , which actually works with setting up / reconfiguring an Airport Express.\nBoth versions (ML comes with 6.x) can be used on Mountain Lion. Keep both around, for now.\nThough once setup, my AE responds well to AU 6.x. \nI don't know why .. but then, ours is not to reason why, is it.\n", "Q: Native RSS reader which allows to set explizit the status of an article I am looking for a native RSS reader for Mac OS which allows me to mark an article as read or unread explicitly by a short cut. All RSS reader I found mark an article as read immediately after viewing them. So I lose the overview which articles I have read and which not.\n\nA: Thank you for your answers. After trying different web-based tools and native applications I returned to Thunderbird. Thunderbird supports RSS-Feeds as well and allows you to specify the amount of time you have to view a mail or article until it marks it as read. It also allows you to disable this at all and to mark articles manually as read.\n\nA: I haven't used it, but I think Yoleo might have the ability to do this.\n\nA: Have you tried  Feedly?\nMany options as to marking / keeping Read articles. \nNice on the web too - they have a Safari extension.\n", "Q: How to use two internet connections independently I have two internet connections, the one is high speed and I connect to through WiFi and the other is a slow PPPoE connection. I have a 5 gig cap for the WiFi connection and a 20 gig cap for the PPPoE connection so the idea is that I use WiFi for general internet browsing, emails etc and the PPPoE connection for torrents.\nUnfortunately, I don't know how to use both at the same time. Is there any way that I can setup my torrent client to only use the PPPoE connection, and not the WiFi?\n\nA: This is an admittedly convoluted method, but you could run the torrent app in a vm. Vbox, Parallels, Fusion, whichever. Then you can bind the vm's networking to a specific network interface. The default for the vm networking is usually \"Auto\" which means it uses what the Mac uses and that's dictated by the service order in the Networking System Prefs. But you can also bind to a specific interface and that will keep the vm's traffic on that connection. \n\nA: Yes. Bind your torrent client to the desired interface.  Azureus (vuze) for example has this functionality in advanced settings mode.  The client will show your available interfaces and associated [local] ip addresses to help you choose.  If your client does not perhaps you could switch.  You'll additionally gain the ability to \n\n\n*\n\n*block connections from horrible/poor clients (useragent filtering via plug-in) -- preventing wasting your resources on non-sharing peers\n\n*limit transfer speed by time of day (plug-in)\n\n*block connections from horrible/poor clients (useragent filtering via plug-in) \n\n", "Q: Is there a way to launch uTorrent and not display the GUI window? Since uTorrent to my best of knowledge doesen't support a daemon/server mode, I would like to add it to launchd to start upon login (and restart after a potential crash), but without the app window opening. \nIs there a way to do this?\n\nA: Try saving a plist like this as ~/Library/LaunchAgents/utorrent.plist:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC -//Apple Computer//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd>\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n    <key>Label</key>\n    <string>utorrent</string>\n    <key>ProgramArguments</key>\n    <array>\n        <string>open</string>\n        <string>-gjWa</string>\n        <string>uTorrent</string>\n    </array>\n    <key>RunAtLoad</key>\n    <true/>\n    <key>KeepAlive</key>\n    <true/>\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\nIt can be loaded with launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/utorrent.plist or by logging out and back in.\n  -W, --wait-apps   Blocks until the used applications are closed (even if they were already running).\n  -j, --hide        Launches the app hidden.\n  -g, --background  Does not bring the application to the foreground.\n\n/Applications/uTorrent.app/Contents/MacOS/uTorrent would display a visible uTorrent window if uTorrent wasn't already running.\nAnother option might be to add a line like this to crontab:\n*/5 * * * * pgrep -xq uTorrent && osascript -e 'launch app \"uTorrent\"' || open -gja uTorrent\n\nopen -gj shows the main window if uTorrent is open but has no visible windows. launch shows the main window if uTorrent is not open.\nPrograms run from crontab are run in the system security / login session. For example Mail can't access keychains if it is opened by cron.\n", "Q: Start the recording using the MIDI piano keyboard?

(I know about the count-down feature)\nPS : With cubase, you can define a key on your piano that will be used as command key.\n\nA: If you have any other buttons available on your keyboard, you can use the GarageRemote software to program them as transport controls for GarageBand. Instructions for M-Audio Axiom series keyboards are available here. I'm not sure about programming an actual keyboard key.\n", "Q: What causes the popup alternate characters from showing? I have the latest version of Mountain Lion 10.8.4 but can't use the new hold key to show variations option. So, when I press the n key and hold it down, it would be nice to see the two alternate ñ and ń characters.\nI press but nothing happens. Does anyone have ideas on how to fix this?\n\nA: Are there any background applications or kernel extensions that could disable the popovers? For example KeyRemap4MacBook disables them.\nWhat input method do you use? The popovers don't work with all input methods, or custom keyboard layouts that are not saved in the bundle format.\nYou could also try to run defaults write -g ApplePressAndHoldEnabled -bool true and reopen applications.

I own a MacBook which I purchased approximately 6 years ago (I'm not sure exactly what version it is, but I can get that information if needed). It is running OS X Leopard, and I want to install Mountain Lion onto it. \nIs this possible? If so, how? If not, what is the most recent OS I can get on the system?\n\nA: Probably not. The system requirements for 10.8 say \"MacBook (Late 2008 Aluminum, or Early 2009 or newer)\". You'd also need to install 10.6.8 or 10.7 first in order to install Mountain Lion from App Store.\nSee these Apple KB articles:\n\n\n*\n\n*System requirements for OS X Mountain Lion\n\n*System requirements for OS X Lion and Mac OS X v10.6\n\n*How to identify MacBook models\nEveryMac.com has a list of maximum OS X versions supported by different Macs:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.everymac.com/systems/by_capability/maximum-macos-supported.html\n\n*http://www.everymac.com/mac-answers/os-x-lion-faq/macs-compatible-with-os-x-lion-hack-options-for-incompatible-macs.html\n\nA: Some older MacBooks are supported by MLPostFactor, although even then they want you to install 10.7 (Lion) first.  Upgrading has enough pitfalls that I would recommend not skipping major OS versions anyway, meaning upgrading to Snow Leopard then Lion then Mountain Lion. \nHowever, if your MacBook is supported by Mountain Lion and you want to risk upgrading in one operation, you can create a bootable Mountain Lion USB drive and install from that. \n", "Q: Removing an icon from Mac OS X menubar when Cmd+Drag won't work I noticed this message icon show up on my menubar and I can't tell which app it belongs to.

I have a BIOS password on it as well. \nIf there is a way to automatically select a user at the FileVault screen by pressing Enter or so, then please tell me. What I think I need to do is boot into Single User Mode, but I need to know exactly what prompts I'll encounter until it will display on the external monitor.\n\nA: The simplest thing to do is boot the Mac in target mode (hold the T key down) and connect it via Thunderbolt or Firewire to another Mac so you can have visibility without repairing your Mac's screen. Alternatively, you could just remove the drive from the Mac and use a cheap $5 USB to SATA connector to mount the volume on a Mac to enter the Filevault passphrase to decrypt the volume.\nPresumably, your system isn't booting since even in the blind, you should remember if you have to type in a user name and then press tab or return and then type the password.\nUser selection works by arrow keys and the space bar will select the user (and if you only have one user enabled to unlock the FileVault drive, you boot to a password screen so you only need to enter the password and press enter).\nYou can type the first letter of the user account and then type the password to get logged in. This assumes your user doesn't share a first letter with another account that is sorted before yours. In this case type the letter and then arrow key over to the second, third account and then type the password.\n\nA: Since you tagged your post with MacBook Air, I assume that this is the Mac you are talking about. Thus, target disk mode is not an option. EDIT: I assume you have one of the early MacBook Air models, which don't support target disk mode.\nAs far as I know, there is no way to boot into recovery mode (which supports external screens), if you haven't unlocked your Mac with your firmware password before. \nSome startup key combinations that you can use when your Mac starts, such as those which use the Option or Command keys, may not respond if a firmware password has also been enabled.\nIf you have a firmware password enabled on your Mac, you must successfully enter that password before you can boot to another startup volume, or before you can access the Startup Manager.\nSo the only solution I can think of is to get the drive out our your MacBook and mount it externally through a docking station on another Mac. \n\nA: Ok, this is based on your comment about having two users.\nI have Mountain Lion with two users and tried a reboot here.  On the login screen (where you normally click the user to enter the password), it seems you can press \"Alt+I \" (in your case) to get the password prompt for the user that has a name starting with \"I\" (in my case either Alt+M or Alt+S).  \nAfter pressing Enter, the field for the password opens, so you could type \"password\" and get to the desktop.\nI don't know about File-Vault, or what it would look like, but if you know how to get to the User-Login screen without seeing it, the above will get you logged in and that may display the 2nd monitor.\n(Regarding your other comment about it being hard to put the drive into a Mac-Mini, you don't need to put it \"into\" the Mac.  A cheap USB case will let you connect the drive to any computer or Mac via the USB port.) \n\nA: To get the initial output on your external monitor you need to do this:-\n\n\n*\n\n*Plug in the external monitor, and ensure it's on.\n\n*Open the (powered off) macbook lid\n\n*Hit the mac power button, and immediately (fast as you can) close the lid\n\n\nSo long as the lid is closed right from the start, it will use the external output properly.  If you hear the chime and the lid is open, it will not use the external output until after the O/S boots.\n\nA: I am assuming you have not used Time Machine to keep all data in case this happens.\nI have just received my wife's MacbookAir with a cracked screen, she has backed up with Time Machine, all i do now is get a new machine and load it from her back up drive. First i connected it to an external screen then connected using Thunderbolt to HDMI port on my tv. Problem solved. Please use back up on your machines.\n", "Q: How can I stop/start all Mac OS X Server services at once? When doing maintenance on our OS X Server (10.8.4), I need to shut down all server services one by one. While it is not too much of a drag to click all services off, perform maintenance, and back on, I wonder, if there is a way to automate this procedure. \nIs there? \n\nA: You could do it from the command line and/or write a script with the relevant services:\nsudo launchctl list\n\nAnd for ssh (remote login) for example\nsudo launchctl stop com.openssh.sshd\n\nBringing them back up then with start (instead of stop)\n", "Q: Disabling all non-essential system resources I am running a lab experiment on my Macbook Pro and I'm calculating the results of a program (physics simulation) so I need all of the available CPU I can get. Since the program that I have to run requires full access to the GPU I cannot boot in safe mode because it seems to reduce the graphics quite a bit. Things that I am doing now:\nQuitting all application (of course), quitting Finder, disabling all sharing services (in system preferences), plugging laptop into AC adapter, reducing screen brightness (not sure if it will help), turning off wifi/bluetooth, disabling time machine, disabling all notifications and disabling sounds.\nThis is probably sufficient but is there something else I could do?\n\nA: You can disable user defined non-essential system resources by:\n\n\n*\n\n*Opening the Activity Monitor\n\n*Selecting the My Processes view:.\n\n*Sort by Most Memory and look at all memory-consuming processes.\n\n*Or Sort by CPU usage.\nSee the sample picture below:\n\n", "Q: My clock is slow over long period of time - Macbook Pro 2011 13\" When i leave my macbook alone for a day (doesn't matter if it's asleep or off), and access it after, my clock is always slow about an hour.\nI know this isn't an OSX issue, cause i use bootcamp too and the same thing happens there.\nIt also doesn't matter if i'm on battery or if i'm plugging in.\nI'm certain it's not a time zone issue either... it can be slow 35 minutes, or slow 135 minutes, depending on how long i leave it alone.  Its like the macbook is living in another time dimension.\nSome piece of hardware on the macbook that is responsible for keeping the time is messed up... but i don't know what that piece of hardware is and if i can replace it.\nCan someone tell me?\n\nA: The clock time is keep by a battery or capacitor on some models. It is a small battery on the motherboard and used when the computer is off.\nWhen the computer is on and online it will automatically update the clock time.\nNormally that battery last 3-5 years. \nTry setting the time manually, by getting the actual update for apple time server.\n\nsudo ntpdate -u time.apple.com\n\nthen you will see something like\n\n8 Jun 14:30:11 ntpdate[28267]: adjust time server 17.151.16.14 offset\n  0.000336 sec\n\nYou generally don’t need to do this if you use the “Set date and time automatically” feature within the Date & Time settings.\n\nIf that did not work, reset your SMC and PRAM (System management Controller)\nI can not believe it is your battery but everything is possible :(. Assuming you do not have 2 left hands, you could do that your self.\n\nA: after a long time, i figured out my problem.  \nSo just to reiterate, my clock would not reset by some consistent number.  But it would always reset around 3-5 hours, depending.  I noticed it was doing it even during use.  I would check the windows event log, and it showed that the hardware reset my time.\nThis happened to me twice after doing a CLEAN osx install, and then a CLEAN windows 8 install.  After i install the bootcamp drivers, my clock was erratic in Windows 8.\nI solved my problem when i went into OSX, and did a \"get latest time from internet\" (it was already set to automatic, but i explicitly made it do that).  Afterwards, i reset back into Windows 8 and REINSTALLED the bootcamp drivers a second time.  The second time... it did something that fixed the service that kept resetting my time.  My time is always correct now.\nSo if you are having trouble, trying installing your bootcamp drivers TWICE.  Must be a glitch in latest windows 8 drivers.\n", "Q: For the Apple SSD drives, will they run slower with less free space available? From what I understand, most SSDs will run slower once there is 20% or less free space available, due to TRIM/garbage collection. However, are Apple SSDs the same way?\nThe reason I ask is because I've seen some drives that are advertised as 256 GB but actually are 280 GB or so in size, so even if they are \"full\" they can still run at peak performance.\nSo, I'm thinking of getting a Mac Mini from Apple with an SSD preinstalled in it. Would I have to leave 20% free space at least for peak performance?\n\nA: The drives are provisioned with space set aside to handle garbage collection and bad block replacement. I'm sure it's possible to drive the create benchmarks where a measurable drop in performance is shown under certain conditions but I've used six different SSD's in three different MB/MBP and have never noticed a drop in performance even when the drives were almost full.\n", "Q: iMessage between iPhone and MacBook Pro If i am on my MacBook Pro's iMessage and messaging someone that has an iPhone through iMessage will their replies and my messages show up on their phone bill. if it shows up will it be as data or as texting?\n\nA: iMessage uses data not SMS. It can use either Wifi or 3G. However, it is a free service for all users. The only charge anyone can receive for iMessage is if they had to pay for every byte of data they used, but most contracts and even pay as you go offers data, and iMessage doesn't use up much data unless you send a photo or video.\n", "Q: How do I show all hidden & invisible files on the command line (both .files and invisible flagged files)? Is there a way to show only the hidden and invisible files in a directory using the command line?\nFor instance ls -a | grep \"^\\.\" will show all the files hidden by a period as the first character, but what about files hidden with the invisible flag or listed in .hidden (mostly deprecated in practice, don't worry about that one so much.)?\n\nA: If the files are indexed by Spotlight and files in subdirectories can be included, you could use mdfind:\nmdfind kMDItemFSInvisible=1 -onlyin .\n\nOr test for both GetFileInfo -av (attribute invisible) and if the name starts with a period:\nshopt -s dotglob nullglob\nfor f in *; do [[ $(GetFileInfo -av \"$f\") = 1 || $f = .* ]] && echo \"$f\"; done\n\nGetFileInfo is part of the command line tools package that can be downloaded from Xcode's preferences or from developer.apple.com/downloads.\nDifferent ways to list only files that start with a period:\nshopt -s nullglob; printf %s\\\\n .[^.]* ..?*\nshopt -s dotglob nullglob; GLOBIGNORE='. ..'; printf %s\\\\n *\nls -a | grep -E '^(\\.[^.]|\\.\\.[^$])'\n\n", "Q: Full voice control for Mac What's an app that let's my control my Mac with voice commands, always on, with no keyboard and no mouse? I'm talking about an iMac mounted on a wall that is always listening for voice control commands.\nThe only app support really needed is a web browser -- I'm not asking to control photoshop with my voice or something!\nBut it must be a setup that never requires me to connect a keyboard or mouse, even if it crashes and needs a reboot. \n\nA: If you want to totally control your Mac with your voice, I should strongly recommend to use dragon dictate 3 for mac from Nuance. But you need to know some Applescript to implement some user command.\nYou should also buy Plantronics microphone for quality based recognition.\nRegards\nClaude\n", "Q: iCloud data storage deletion Is there a way to permanently erase all the data on iCloud or some category, or once stored is the data always available on iCloud, with no option to delete permanently?\n\nA: On iOS\nYou can go to Settings > General > Usage > Manage Storage. You can then select an app that you wish to remove iCloud data for, tap Edit, then delete the data that you no longer need on iCloud.\n(Some apps only have a Documents & Data section - this means that it will remove all data from iCloud, without any option of selecting individual files.)\n\nOn Mac\nYou can go to ~/Library/Mobile Documents and delete individual apps/files there.\n\n", "Q: What font is used for the file extensions in mac icons?

Since I only use the machine locally, I would like to delete that folder, but doesn't matter how many time you delete or hide it, it keeps appear again.\nAny tip?\n\nA: You can hide it from from Finder by setting the hidden flag with Terminal\nchflags hidden /path/to/folder/\n\nand if you want to remove the flag\nchflags nohidden /path/to/folder/\n\n", "Q: Deleting photos When I try to delete my photos from my iphone to get more storage space (which I have run out of) it says that they will delete every where. I don't want then to be deleted from my iPad as my iPad syncs with my iPhone. Can you help please?\n\nA: If you delete from your \"My Photo Stream\" you will get this warning. The Photo Stream is automatically synced across all devices using your Apple ID. If you delete from one, it will delete from all that sync to that stream.\nIf you switch to Albums and select Camera Roll, you will be deleting photos from your iPhones storage only.\n\nA: Connect to iTunes, select your iPhone in the sidebar, import all photos.\nOnce all photos are imported, you'll be presented with a dialog box that will allow you to delete all the camera roll photos.\nThen you'll need to use iTunes to sync the photos you want.\n\nA: The fastest way I've found to bulk delete photos off an iPhone, is the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*In Photos, click on the button at the top left until you get to \"Years\"\n\n*For each year click on the strip of photos.

It runs 10.7.5 and can't update any further, it's got a 1.83Ghz Core2Duo and 4Gb RAM, and I've stuffed a 128Gb Apple SSD in it.\nI'm trying to install nginx on it to act as a small home web server, to quickly share files with colleagues and host some development I'm doing. I'm used to do this on Debian installs, but it's the first time I'm doing it on OSX and I want to do things well.\nSo I've installed nginx with Homebrew:\nbrew install nginx\n\nand I'm trying to set it up so that:\n\n\n*\n\n*it loads at boot, without the need to login (via /Library/LaunchDaemons, though I'm not proficient with that yet) – can anybody help me with the plist?\n\n*it runs as www-data, not root – can anybody tell me which is the best way to create this user account? It does not need to be able to login through the window manager, it's just meant to be a unix account. Though I'd appreciate being able to connect to the mini with AFP as www-data and directly share the /var/www (or equivalent) folder on my LAN, that'd help me drop files easily. Probably /usr/local/var/www from what I understand. Again, I'm accustomed to doing that with Debian (with the help of netatalk and avahi).\n\n\nWhat's the best setup for doing this? Directory structures, configuration files?\nAny pointer appreciated for the nginx.conf too, cause the stock config provided by Homebrew is quite different from what I'm used to on Debian.\nAlso, won't it conflict with the stock Apache? I want to run it on port 80 (and eventually make it available to the whole world).\n(PHP would be welcome too, but for now I just want a solid, plain old webserver, before adding PHP to it).\n[Note: I'd rather tag this question nginx, but I can't as I haven't earned enough rep here. Can somebody tag it for me?]\n\nA: If you type brew info nginx you should get answers to many of your questions.  In particular, you should see something like:\nTo have launchd start nginx at login:\n    ln -sfv /usr/local/opt/nginx/*.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents\nThen to load nginx now:\n    launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.nginx.plist\n\nSo I expect if you link the plist to /Library/LaunchDaemons instead of ~/Library/LaunchAgents it will load at boot.\nI don't know what you want to change, but it's the same nginx as you use on Debian, so you can copy over your Debian nginx.conf if you want.  Also the brew package comes with a set of default/example configuration files installed under /usr/local/etc/nginx/.  \nThe default conf runs on port 8080, so you have to edit it to run on port 80, and yes it will conflict with Apache running on port 80 so you have to turn Apache off or put it on another port.  Apache config files are in /private/etc/apache2/ and you can turn it off via System Preferences -> Sharing -> Personal Web Sharing.  (Note that this option has been removed in Mountain Lion.  Mountain Lion still ships with Apache, but it is disabled by default.)\nYou can, of course, set it up however you want, but if you're looking for what's easy and Mac-like, just follow the Apache setup, which uses user and group _www and uses /Library/WebServer/Documents as document root and serves user content out of ~user/Sites.\n", "Q: Copying 85000 files...(takes literally for ever) So I have these 85000 files (totally 2.5gb) that I wish to copy from my Mac to my ReadyNAS NV+ [X-RAID] with RAIDiator 4.1.10 [1.00a043]\nIt's a bunch of Matlab files.\nAnyway, it's like it cannot be done. I went thru the wired network and let it copy all thru the night.

I'm using the finder.\n\nA: If your NAS supports FTP or SFTP, you could try with a client like Cyberduck. That could be more efficient than through the Finder (with AFP).\n", "Q: Stress Testing Your Mac For Optimal Performance? Stress testing maybe considered a useful way to determine if your Mac is performing at its optimal level of performance & may also be an indicator of faults of any components within your Mac.\nWhat methods exist (ideally free if possible) to stress test to the max the following components:\n\n\n*\n\n*CPU\n\n*Hard Disk\n\n*Ram\n\n\nThereby identifying any problem(s) that may exist & if your Mac can handle them ?\n\nA: There is a built-in hardware test designed by Apple.\nWith the introduction of Intel-based Macs, Apple has built the AHT utility right into your Mac. \nSimply hold down the D key while starting up your Mac to boot into the Apple Hardware Test.\nI would not recommend using garden variety www not approved test programs. This would be the same as if you have a car with a speedometer marked 150 MPH would you actually drive it @155 MPH to find out if it holds up using non OEM tires?\n\nA: CPU: purchase an app which can use up all the cores @ 100% and let it crank until your Mac is a pile of smoking plastic or the power goes out, which ever comes first. Rendering a large & complex animation with the Radiosity setting in Strata Studio Pro can do this for you.\nHD: If you don't mind zapping the contents of the HD, run DiskUtility and then Erase the HD using the most stringent Security option available - a 7-pass write with zeros. It'll take days, but the disk heads will be in constant motion the whole time. With a MTBF usually measured in the millions of hours, it'll take more than a century to zap a perfectly constructed disk drive, given perfect electronics and no power dips/sags.\nRAM: Take a look at Memtest 4 and run it endlessly.\nIn essence, I don't think I really, truly understand what you want to stress test here. To me, making sure these three components work optimally would mean:\n\n*\n\n*making sure the Mac has clean, filtered & conditioned power from a\nhigh-end battery-backup device;\n\n*guaranteeing near-perfect environmental conditions (constant temperature,\nlow humidity and low particulate levels)\n\nYou could also purchase 'Enterprise' grade hard drives.\nAll bets are off, though, should a gamma wave come through your neighborhood. In this case, you'd probably be more worried about keeping your skin from bursting into flames.\n2022 Edit:\nWith the prevalence of SSDs over HDDs, the suggestion to erase the drive with a a stringent security regime is not recommended for SSDs.\nSee this link at MacSales for information about how to check the health of a SSD on macOS.\n\nA: A simple way to test the CPU, fans and general heat management. It's an old Unix trick.\nWarning: This can fry your system if your tempreture sensors are malfunctioning. Even if they are not, it will stress the system enough to affect operational lifetime if you repeat it to often. Never run for more than 120 seconds! Never run unattended!\n1) Open Activity monitor and choose Window->CPU Monitor. This will provide a floating window showing a bar graph with one bar for each core. Your total number of cores they system sees both the hardware and virtual cores so your number of hardware cores is 1/2 the number of bars e.g. if you see 8 bars you have four hardware cores. This is the number to test. \nI will term this window the \"Core-window\"\n-2)because when the system becomes stressed it might not be able to switch the GUI. If you wait to select the Killall-window unitl after the system cores are heavily taxed, you might not be able to stop the stress command before it damages the system. \n3) Watch the Core-window. One of the bars should rise to the top and stay there.  When the bar reaches the top, the core is maxed out. Hit return and activate the killall yes command.\n4) Now that you have the system tested, you can max out all the cores. The virtual cores don't really count so count of the number of real cores. Now, repeat the step above exactly except that  in the Yes-window type 'yes > /dev/null & then repeat for the number of real cores you have e.g. for 4 cores the command would be 'yes > /dev/null &  yes > /dev/null &  yes > /dev/null &  yes > /dev/null but do not hit return. \n5) Hit return and immediately click over to the Killall-window and prepare to hit return. \nThe time it takes the fans to come one and/or the system to lock up or crash will tell the type and scope of your problem. \nA) Fans should come on about 10 seconds in. If they come on nearly immediately. You may have cooling issues e.g. dirty air intake\nB)In all the systems I've done this on, the fans will reach maximum in under a 60 seconds. If they don't reach maximum within 90 seconds, you probably have bad fans. \nC) If the system shuts down or locks up before the fans can be heard or before they max out, you have either bad fans, heat sink etc. \nThis is also a good way to stress a system to test how software behaves under system load. However, in those test you usually only max out about 25% of the cores. \n(There is a way to stress test drives as well manually but time precludes me detailing it. I'll add it later, time permitting.) \n\nA: I would argue against 'stress-testing' for any reason. You're not looking for a leaky gasket or seeing if a valve blows.\nFirstly, as pointed out, SSDs not hard drives are now the norm. You're not going to learn anything about its 'optimal performance' by filling it 100% full of data, one or more times. You might do nothing but shorten its life; though write-cycles are sufficiently high these days.\nRAM\nmacOS will try to use as much RAM as it can, and will often 'fill' any spare memory with cached data. If your memory was reporting errors, your Mac wouldn't start.\nCPU\nAgain, even if you use 100% of all your cores: what will that tell you? You might gain some insight into the performance under load; though arguably, you'd get more useful 'real-world' results just running whatever task you're actually planning on doing.\n", "Q: Apple Programming Guides on Kindle?

Instead, the computer has a private IP address and sends all traffic to the private IP address of a router which then forwards the traffic the the public internet using a public IP address.\nThe only reliable way to determine the public IP address associated with your computer's traffic is to contact an external source and have it tell you what IP address it sees your traffic coming from.\n\nA: The external IP address you seek is really an arbitrary network router somewhere upstream of your connection, so your proposed solutions are all valid in needing an external device to confirm the external address. \nIf your Mac has a true routable internet address, then it is \"external\" already whether or not your routers use NAT or not.\nTo know about external routing details, you need to have access to the routers or to another computer that will run a traceroute or otherwise log the source IP address it needs to send responses to for the packets that originate from your Mac.\n\nA: I don't think you can get an external IP without connecting to any external source as the IP Address you are looking for is not connected with your computer internally. External IP address is assigned to you by your Internet Service Provider. That is how the Internet and all other computers outside your local network see you. You can get this address by connecting to external source. I use IP-Details.com to check my external IP address mostly.\n", "Q: can't install xcode, issue with MobileDevice.pkg I am trying to install xcode on my mac version : Mac OS X Lion 10.7.5 But I'm having a problem,\ni download xcode version 4.6.2 from Appstore after i installed the app i clicked on the icon in the launchpad and it just opened and ask me to install device support so i click install and it ask for my password so i entered the pass and it wrote:\nAn unknown error occurred.

I have been on the phone with an Apple agent and no luck.  It seems strange to me that this file would not be in the trash bin or somehow be able to be extracted.  Where could it have gone?  Is there someone out there or a product that can help me locate this back up? BTW, I thought it was an older back-up so I deleted it. (the name confused me- Iphone 3 rather than Iphone 5).  They are not on iCloud and I do not use Time machine, so my only hope is to recover from my iMac.\nThanks\n\nA: You can get one of many data recovery softwares. They are not free. It doesn't matter what kind of content you lost, so recovering the iTunes backup is the same process as recovering a text document, etc.\nFirst of all, stop using the computer (or that particular hard drive). The more you use it, the more files are written to disk, and you lower your chances of being able recover the file.\nI have had good experiences with Data Rescue in the past. (http://prosofteng.com).\nIf the deleted file was on the same drive as your OS (the boot drive), you will need to use a different system for the recovery software. You can download and install your recovery software of choice on a different Mac, then boot your iMac in Target Disk Mode and connect them via FireWire. (http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1661)\nIf the deleted file was on an external drive, you don't need a second Mac; just run the recovery software. In any case, you will need to know the location the file was deleted from. Normally that would be ~/Library/Application Support/MobileSync/Backup/\n", "Q: Change apple ID associated with Mac App Store application How can I change the Apple ID associated with an application downloaded from the Mac App Store? For example, when I try to update an application, it says for me to login with the account that downloaded the application.

Maybe in the Package Contents?\n\nA: Sorry to say, you can't do that. \n", "Q: Internal Mic Option Disappears when using Apple Earbuds Does anyone know of a way to use my macbook pro's internal microphone while using my Apple \"Earpods\" for sound? When I look at the Sound Prefpane without my earbuds in the internal mic option is there, but when I plug in my earbuds with microphone it goes away.\nIs this intentional? Why does it just disappear? What's the point of even having a preferences if you cant choose which one you want to use?\n\nA: As long as you don't plug the earbuds in all the way, you can still use the built-in mic. The catch is that you'll only get audio in one ear of the earbuds.\n\nA: Use any stereo 3.5mm to 3.5mm plug. Out that in your computer and the plug in the headphones to the adapter. The stereo adapter will not see the mic, so the computer will not see the mic.\nYou can get these 6 inches (15cm) long or so, maybe even shorter. If you want just an adapter without a cord, get a stereo splitter. Search for “headphone splitter” and you can find plenty under $5.\n\nA: Plugging in the Apple earbuds with the built in mic (the plug on the left) cuts out the Macbook's microphone. This is useful for things like Skype and other IP telephony, as well as for relatively hands-free use of the iPhone 5. The iPhone 5 also has noise-cancellation which may be why the earbud mic sounds nasty when connected to the computer. You will need to plug in a normal 3-conductor set of earbuds/headphones, (the plug on the right,) to get the internal mic working.\n\n\nA: You should be able to bypass the headset mic and use the Mac's internal mic if you select internal mic (double click it to select it) on the sound input preference tab and then plug in your headset.\nThis troubleshooting procedure is detailed on apples website at: https://support.apple.com/kb/PH25716?locale=en_US&viewlocale=en_US\n\nA: Use a 3-connection 1/8\" TRS extension cable.\nThere is no software option exposed to the user for this operation. However I regularly use the big-ass cozy Sony DJ headphones with my MacBook and the built in mic to take phone calls. This works because the MBA/MBP has a sensor for 4-connection TRS male connections and will disable the built in microphone. A simple 3-connection extension will work perfectly fine as a \"4-connection to 3-connection adapter\". \nThe shortest such cable I found on Amazon is 12\". You can search for \"YCS Basics 1 Foot 3.5mm Stereo Headphone Extension Cable\".\n\nA: I agree this behavior is very annoying. \nI have found that even a 4-connection adapter, like this very short and cheap one works. It does keeps the built-in mic as input and costs less than $2. \nThe key to making it work seems to be: First plug in the adapter alone, then plug the headphones in. Plugging them together may cause input to switch.\nTo actually gain some new functionality with your purchase, getting an L-shaped adapter like this one will prevent the annoying and dangerous sticking straight out which could cause your jack/headphones plug to get mangled.\nI wish there was a software solution too but it seems not!\n", "Q: System-Preferences Applescript using osascript cannot select its window This AppleScript (based on an answer in a MacWorld form) will tell me whether or not Screen Sharing is enabled:\ntell application \"System Preferences\"\n    reveal pane \"com.apple.preferences.sharing\"\nend tell\n\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    tell process \"System Preferences\"\n        set screen_sharing_toggle to value of (checkbox 1 of row 2 of table 1 of scroll area 1 of group 1 of window 1) as boolean\n    end tell\nend tell\n\ntell application \"System Preferences\"\n        Quit\nend tell\n\nset newvar to screen_sharing_toggle\n\nSo if I run that in the AppleScript editor it returns true or false depending on the setting of Screen Sharing.

(-1719)\n\n\nA: So there are two ways this script can fail:\n\n\n*\n\n*Command line version unable to get the System Preferences window.\n\n*Running it will cause the complaint about enabling access for assistive devices.\n\n\nWell the latter case as it turns out is self-explanatory: This script requires that you have enabled access for assistive devices.  The former is still not obvious, but if you quit System Preferences and restart it then it might work; it finally did for me, and I have amended the code above to get System Preferences to quit at the end.\n", "Q: How to test if video is local or stream? If I watch a video in QuickTime Player, how I can test in my AppleScript, if this video file is on my Mac or is it streamed live from the net?\n\nA: If you open AppleScript editor and then open dictionary and choose your version of quicktime player, you can see the dictionary your system supports.\nOn Mountain Lion - you would look under the Standard Suite and inspect the document property to see that file would tell you if the movie is saved locally.\nPresumably, you could then infer that you are playing HTTP or RSTP streaming video, but I don't see any way for AppleScript (or automator) to know if the stream was previously recorded or live from the dictionary Apple provides for the version 10.2 of Quicktime Player.\n\n", "Q: keyboard input stopped being accepted after login I just disabled my screensaver successfully by entering my password, then after that my machine no longer accepts keyboard input.  The only thing I was able to do is change windows with option-left/right/up/down, but no other keys worked.  The mouse worked.\nI have ssh and vnc sessions open.  The VNC session also does not accept keyboard input, so it cannot be a physical problem with the keyboard.  The ssh session does, so the computer is alive and well in some limited sense.\nHow can I debug this?  Are there any command-line equivalents to KeyboardViewer.app?  Any recommendations short of 'reboot the machine' would be very helpful.\n(running 10.6.8 on this machine)\n\nA: I'd start with any apps or utilities that might intercept USB devices. I once had a forgotten keyboard tool that was used to alter mapping of command and option keys that was not compatible with a system update and caused a similar problem. \nUSB Overdrive? Keyboard macros? Virtual machine apps? Any similar things could be capturing the USB input from the keyboard and failing to pass to the OS. \n", "Q: how to reinstall xcode command-line tools? I had serious problems from two versions of Xcode on the same machine. I removed all Xcode app instances & many other non-System 'xcode'-related files, then reinstalled the app (4.6.2), fixing my original problem. But xcodebuild and xcode-select are still not available, which I need to run PhoneGap for iOS.

I'd make a junk admin user that I'll delete and use that user to install Xcode and the command line tools and then finally restore from Time Machine.

I'm wondering if this could either be a Hard Drive failure or possibly graphics or logic board issue.  I made an appointment to the genius bar tonight, hopefully someone will be able to tell me something.  Does anyone have the same issue OR have been able to fix this?\n\nA: The fact that it boots perfectly fine in safe mode points to a problem with your graphics card. Safe mode disables all hardware drivers besides those absolutely essential to the operation of your system, and that includes hardware graphics rendering. The reason your graphics are so choppy in safe mode is because everything is rendered in software (i.e. by your CPU) rather than in hardware (by your GPU). I doubt it's a hard drive issue simply because you have no problem installing ML or booting up. \nThe good news? Since your repair was around a year ago, you might be able to convince the Apple Store people (talk to the manager) to replace your logic board for free.\n", "Q: Stop iPhone alerting me when I'm in a phone call When I'm in a phone call, I still get alerts for emails and texts.

This will disable all sounds and vibration.\n\nA: In iOS 15, you can accomplish this using a custom Focus. I created a custom focus called “Telephone” that activates automatically while using the FaceTime or Phone apps.\nUpdate: Unfortunately, iOS appears to treat the call in progress screen as a separate app from the Phone app itself, so this technique doesn’t quite do what we want.\n\nA: download a silent ringtone. Set your phone alerts to this ring tone. its the only  way.\n\nA: Quickest way to shut off text tone, or any other, is to tap volume up or down one click, this cancels tones.

They gave me a case ID but told me to go to the local service and let them handle it.\nThis time, they concluded that the HDD/SSD bracket/cable (don't know the correct English term for this) was loose. After testing with a different one, they concluded that this was the problem. The cause was probably due to not using ESD protection when installing the new RAM or SSD. I will get it back tomorrow, and hopefully this is the cause and not a faulty logic board.\nEDIT: It seems like this didn't solve anything, but it now beeps three times when crashing and on boot, which indicates faulty memory. Ordered new, now waiting...\n", "Q: Does iPod Touch 5th gen 16GB (mid 2013) still have built-in Camera app for use with front-facing camera? Recall: At the end of May, Apple introduced a lower-cost iPod Touch (5th generation, mid 2013) with just 16GB of storage, in one color (silver), no hand-strap, and no iSight rear-facing camera – but the front FaceTime camera remains.  So:\n\n\n*\n\n*Does this low-cost model of the iPod Touch 5th gen still ship with the iOS built-in \"Camera\" app, for use with the front-facing FaceTime camera that remains?\n\n\nI'm asking because this is the first iOS device that has only a front-facing camera, and I'm not sure if it is for FaceTime only, or if the camera can still be used for stills and video (facing the user's direction, of course.)  Thanks!\n\nA: The answer is yes — the iPod touch 5th gen 16GB does still have the Camera app. Here's confirmation direct from Apple's recently-updated iPod touch manual:\n\n\n*\n\n*iPod touch User Guide - For iOS 6.1 Software (June 2013) [PDF]\nIn Chapter 9, \"Camera\", on page 54, it states:\n\nWith iPod touch, you can take both still photos and videos, using the\n  FaceTime camera on the front or the camera on the back (available on\n  some models).\n\nThere's also an accompanying image showing the built-in Camera app's user interface, and notes indicating controls for the flash and to \"Switch between cameras\" may not be available on some models:\n\n\n\nFinally, I've also learned that third-party apps that use cameras on iOS devices should continue to function provided they use the iOS APIs correctly — as demonstrated in Apple sample code — to query the device for camera capability and the available cameras.  (When a third-party app assumes a rear-facing camera is always available on a camera-supporting device, such an app won't necessarily operate correctly on the iPod touch 5th gen 16GB.)\n", "Q: How can I get Launchbar to open the Wireless Diagnostic app? I use Launchbar Version 5.5 (1008) to start programs from the keyboard and can't figure out how to start one specific app that comes with Mountain Lion 10.8.4 Build 12E55.\nHas anyone figured out how to launch the /System/Library/CoreServices/Wireless Diagnostic.app by assigning a custom shortcut or custom indexing rule?\n\nI suspect the fact that the app needs an administrator password to run is messing up the indexing or the launching of the app, but can't be sure. To get Launchbar to index the CoreServices, I added the path /System/Library/Coreservices to the Specific Places and it finds other tools in CoreServices but not the one app I want. \n\nI also tried letting the index rule Search Everywhere and selected Include applications inside the Library folders.\n\n\nA: I emailed the developer and got a very clear reply. The application has a white list to avoid putting unknown CoreServices into play, so the steps I took to index that folder were for naught. The 5.5.1 update to the app fixes this one tool.\nIf you can't update or want to learn how to index this file manually, read on...\nI needed to instead use the Launchbar Custom List function to explicitly index the services I desired.\n\nAlso, the developer has a practice of updating the white list once Apple's update can be tested, so unless you need something like I did right after a new OS is released, just waiting for a LaunchBar update might also solve this problem in the future.\n", "Q: How to install Snow Leopard from XP on MacBook? The only OS installed on my MacBook is a XP pack 3. \nI would like to install Snow Leopard on XP but when I boot from CD , It does not work I have a \"panic kernel error\"\nany help ? \n\nA: you have to make a bootable usb disk.\nTransmacfor for Windows (2-week trial) can format USB drives for mac and restore .dmg files to USB drives.\nhttp://www.asy.com/scrtm.htm\nDownload Transmac and install in Windows\nIn the right-side panel of Transmac, right click on your USB Drive >> Format Disk >> Format with Disk Image\nPoint to your .dmg file and click Open.\nyour USB Drive has to be at least 8GB.\n", "Q: Wireless display from one laptop to another Here is my setup:\n\n\n*\n\n*macbook pro retina physically connected to 2 external monitors, and keyboard+mouse.\n\n*17 macbook on its own\nWhat I want to do:\nI'd like to somehow use one of the external monitors connected to laptop (1) to display the screen of laptop (2).  \nThe idea is that I don't want to have to connect/disconnect anything.  I want to be able to, on demand, use 1 of the displays connected to (1) to display what is on (2) without physically adjusting cables.\nIs this possible?  Bonus points if someone can suggest a software kvm style solution so that in addition to using the monitors connected to (1), I can also use the mouse + keyboard connected to (1) to drive (2)\n\nA: *\n\n*click \"System preferences > sharing\" and enable the screen sharing. \n\n*on screen sharing preferences copy the Adress that is like this \"vnc://...\" save to a txt file and send to the other computer through airdrop.\n\n*open safari on the other computer, paste the addres and press enter, the screen of the first computer will apear.\nYou don't need any software, doing this steps you will control bouth computers with 1 mouse and 1 keyboard :) \n\nA: *\n\n*Install Reflector on the Mac to receive the screen data over the network.\n\n*Configure AirPlay to extend the sending Mac's screen.\n\n*Wait for OS X Mavericks which will allow the remote screen to be a full screen with a Dock and full control rather than a mirror display that Mountain Lion allows.\n\n\nReverse this when you want to have a different keyboard and mouse to drive. IF you're OK with mirroring just the one remote screen to the local Mac with many screens, you might also be able to just use Remote Desktop (Apple's version, Screens app, or other VNC control to bring the remote Mac's display to the local Mac).\n", "Q: Spotlight constantly indexes MacBook Air (Lion). Takes up 50+% of cpu So I noticed my Air was running very slow. Opened Activity monitor and noticed a process mdworker taking up most of the space. I googled it and it seems to be related to Spotlight.\nI opened Spotlight and there appears to be a progress bar along with the message that it is indexing my MacBook Air. I've let this run for ages now but it seems to be stuck at 95%. I tried restarting but I get the same thing. Force quitting mdworker does nothing as it just seems to start again.\nWould anyone have any ideas on how to solve this? Thanks!\n\nA: Try to erase the Spotlight index by either running sudo mdutil -Ea or by temporarily adding your startup disk to the privacy tab in the Spotlight preference pane.\nIf that doesn't work, try to run:\nsudo lsof|grep mdworker\n\nor \nsudo mdutil -Ea;opensnoop -n mdworker\n\nto see if the indexing hangs on some specific files.\n", "Q: Any need to verify disks after hard reboot? About every few days I need to reboot my 2012 MacBook Pro Retina.\nI noticed these messages in the logs regarding \"Journal is read-only and journal is dirty. Can not mount volume\".\nAny need to \"Verify Disk\" in Disk Utilities?\n\n\nA: OS X doesn't normally seem to repair drives or volumes after hard resets or kernel panics, or at least the verbose startup output looks the same, and you don't probably need to do that manually either.\nIn this case you could try verifying the drives or volumes (logical partitions) as troubleshooting steps though. Note that the Verify Disk button performs completely different operations depending on whether a drive or a volume is selected. HFS+ volumes that support live verification can be verified even when they are mounted as the root filesystem, but you have to start up from the recovery partition to repair them.\nAccording to Apple KB article TS1417, running fsck is not usually necessary.\n", "Q: Any advice on troubleshooting instability in Mountain Lion OS X 10.8.4? In all cases of crashes, I can SSH to the machine, but I can't figure out anything useful to remedy the situation.\nThis freeze happened when sizing the crop in Aperture.

I find that hard to believe that this issue cannot be troubleshooted via ssh or the logs.\nNeedless to say, freezing every 3 days is awful. My guess is that the issue is related to updates related to Aperture or Chrome. I'm pretty sure I've been running Chrome every time the machine has crashed.

I had a similar issue with graphics-instability in my 2009 Mac Pro. After I replaced the graphics card I realized the original one was chock-full of dust blocking basically all airflow to the GPU fan. I disassembled it and cleaned it out and it is now running fine (albeit with smcFanControl ramped up a bit, because it seems my chipset also runs hot or has a bad sensor).\nWhat I'm trying to say here is: try to make sure you have good air-flow in addition to ramping up the fan speeds. Easiest is just to feel if there is flow, but if there is not, some disassembly may be required. The stability of my machine was improved drastically by those two measures, though.\n\nThis thread speculated (similar due to the LO_WAT_ALERT error) about ram usage and free swap space, but ultimately solved it with a mobo replacement. \n\nA: if you can ssh into the machine, I would have a detailed read of the syslog output.  You could also post it here but there is going to be a lot to go through. \nProbably best to ssh into the box just after the display crashes and run it then piping the output as such:\nsyslog | tail -n 100 |open -ef\n\n", "Q: Why can't I remove this top entry in the firewall options? I go into the System Preferences, Firewall, then Firewall Options. I can't select the \"File Sharing (FTP)\" entry to remove it. How can I?\n\nUpdate: I'm running OS X 10.7.5, and nothing is enabled in the Sharing preference pane. At some point I must have turned on an FTP daemon for some testing, and forgot about it.  I can do this:\n$ ftp localhost\nTrying 127.0.0.1...\nConnected to localhost.\n220 127.0.0.1 FTP server (tnftpd 20100324+GSSAPI) ready.\n\nTurns out I could shut it off with:\nsudo /bin/launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/ftp.plist\n\nI still feel like I should have been able to block it in the firewall preferences pane.\n\nA: OS X automatically creates firewall entries when a service (like AFP or SSH) is started through System Preferences. \nThat's handy, because you don't have to bother with firewall rules. The OS configures the firewall as necessary for the selected services to work. The downside is that those entries can't be edited or removed from within the Firewall pane, you need to stop the service instead, which is somewhat counterintuitive.\nCould it be that you have enabled FTP file sharing in System Preferences > Sharing?\nIf you are using Mac OS X Leopard or Snow Leopard you need to uncheck \"Share files and folders using FTP\", the firewall entry will then go away (credit: picture from eHow):\n\n(Apple dropped FTP support on OS X Lion, though it can be enabled and disabled through the command line:\n\n\n*\n\n*To enable and start the service:\nsudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/ftp.plist\n\n\n*To disable and stop it:\nsudo launchctl unload /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/ftp.plist\n\n\n*To start/stop it when the system is running:\nsudo launchctl start com.apple.ftpd\nsudo launchctl stop com.apple.ftpd\n\n)\n", "Q: Downgrading from iOS 7 to a recent full backup of iOS 6.1.3 I have a device (iPhone 4S) that is running iOS 7, but I was wondering: Is it possible to restore a full backup of the same device running iOS 6.1.3.\nI'm not worried about losing data from the iOS 7, but I would like to restore the device to its previous state under iOS 6.\nIs this possible?\nAgain, to reiterate: I'm not looking for clean downgrade/install of iOS 6, I wish to restore a full back-up containing an earlier iOS. Thanks.\n\nA: Note: this will only work if downgrading from a prerelease beta OS to a regular version.\nYou can only ever restore an iOS device to the latest public version.\nDowngrading is super easy: Just put your iPhone into DFU mode (plug into iTunes, power off, hold down Sleep/Wake and Home button for 8 seconds, let go of the power button and continue to hold down the home button until iTunes alerts you. The screen should be black) and follow iTunes through there.\n\nA: Don't quote me on this, but I believe there's a download list of ISPWs for iOS 6.1.3 on the home page of the iOS Dev Center. You should be able to download an image and reload your device the same way you loaded it with the beta image. I believe the 6.1.3 images listed here are still being signed (by Apple).\nIf you can successfully get your device running a clean install of 6.1.3, you should be able to do a restore from there.\n\nA: First of all \n\nApple’s official word is that you cannot downgrade your device to iOS\n  6 after installing the beta. This means you shouldn’t install iOS 7\n  unless you are happy running buggy software for a few months.\n\nTo try to downgrade users must first download the IPSW for their device (from here). \nThen connect the device to a Mac or PC with iTunes open. Next press hold the Home and Sleep/Wake button simultaneously for 10 seconds and then release the Sleep/Wake button until iTunes detects your iPhone has been put into recovery mode. While this happens, your iPhone’s screen will remain black.\nWith the device still connected, in iTunes Option+Click (Mac) or Shift+Click (Windows) the Restore iPhone… button. A window should open, in it locate the iOS 6 IPSW you downloaded, select it and confirm your selection. iTunes will now attempt to downgrade your device, after which point you can restore from local or iCloud backups.\n\nA: It doesn't look like it:\n\nNewer devices like the iPhone 5, iPhone 4S, iPad 4, iPad 3, iPad 2, iPad mini and the iPod touch 5G are regrettably “stuck” on whichever firmware they’re currently running – no downgrade method exists, as of now.\n\nhttp://www.evasionjailbreak.com/untethered-6.1.3-jailbreak-6.1.4-ios-7-guide-for-iphone-5s-and-future-devices/\nAlso: http://jailbreakmeme.com/you-cannot-downgrade-ios-7-to-6-1-3-iphone-ipad-ipod-touch/\n", "Q: iOS Developer Contracts Missing After watching the WWDC 13' announcement of iOS 7 I wanted to download and install the beta release of the new OS using my paid developer account. I logged on to iTunesConnect and was greeted with a message telling me I would need to review and agree to the new Developer Agreement and Paid Applications agreement before I can make any app updates. Additionally, my subscription expires on JULY 19th (about 39 days from now). I don't want to (and can't afford to) renew it until it's actually close to expiring.\nFor whatever reason, I cannot seem to find where I'm supposed to go to can accept the updated documents. The \"Contracts, Tax and Billing\" section only gives me the option to view the current documents in place, not renew or review the revised copies. Additionally, the \"Member Center\" simply wines at me to renew my subscription, not telling me where the agreement documents are.\nIf anyone else is having this issue, please let me know how you got through it. I've contacted Apple Support and I'll post what I hear from them.\n\nA: Since Apple has a support department to help paid developers, have you made use of that support?\n\n\n*\n\n*https://developer.apple.com/support/technical/\nFrom your description, it's likely you are not making a mistake and the problem is on the server end, but it could also be something where a warning is being dismissed as whining and the information is there for you to assemble and act on.\n", "Q: Macbook Pro Retina OSX 10.8.3 - Itunes - Windows 7 PC I have been a PC guy for 35 years.

I don't want to waste anymore time hoping to get it back if it's that easy to do so. Please help me out!\nSomeone please help..idk what to do. I've read on other questions that I still may have a chance, how?\n\nA: It wouldn't hurt to report it stolen to your local police and to Apple, especially if you have the serial number.  If you don't have the serial number but you have the purchase details, your dealer may be able to recover the serial number.  \nFrom apple.com/au/contact:  \n\nIf you have lost or found an Apple product, contact your local\n  law-enforcement agency to report it. You can also find a list of\n  serial numbers associated with your Apple ID and get information about\n  using Find My iPhone for iPhone, iPad, iPod touch or Mac.\n\nSoftware running on the machine (About This Mac, System Information) can look at the serial number.  It is hard (but not impossible) to wipe the serial number from the machine.  \nI wonder what happens if the thief (or reciever of stolen goods) sets up the machine and Find My Mac.  Does Apple use the serial number, or just the user's Apple ID?\n", "Q: iPad mini and MacBook Pro 2011 Remote control over Keynote?

Now I'm going to bring my laptop to repair center, and there is a chance that they will replace it to me. It means that I could get back totally clean OS. Will \"time machine\" help me to get everything what I had before ?\n\nA: Yes, Time Machine should restore all your applications, personal files, and preferences, provided you have not made any files private the Time Machine system preferences pane.\nWhen you get your new Mac (or freshly installed OS), it will ask if you want to restore from a Time Machine backup, and I think the process is self-explanatory from there.\nOne caveat - if you have partitioned your hard drive, I believe only the first partition will be automatically restored. You'll have to manually restore the others.\n", "Q: Where did the iAds Network page go?

As a Apple developer I received an invitation to the iOS7 beta. When I logged in, the website said my developer account was expiring \"soon\", and I needed to renew it prior to accessing the beta program. I found this a little strange, as I have had a membership all year.\nBut no problem: I renewed the membership. However, I then received an notice saying would take 24 hours to process my account renewal, and to contact them via email if the renewal has not been processed in this time. I have worked as a Project Manager for large banks and insurance companies, and often transactions are processed in batch via COBOL programs on a mainframe.\nIn banks it is due partially to the number of transactions, but mostly because the systems are old and to update them is a major effort. I am surprised that Apple has the same system, are they also running COBOL batch programs on a mainframe to process membership renewals?\n\nA: Apple do not publish information about the technology behind their web site or online services.\nIt is believed much of Apple's sites are backed by Java based processes stemming from Apple's WebObjects era.\n\nA: Unix system administrators often use cron to schedule processes/jobs to run at certain intervals, and this is most likely what is happening here, and on many sites across the net where actions like mailing list unsubscribe requests produce a similar message saying it will take a certain amount of time for the process to be completed. \nDatabase operations can be \"expensive\" in time and processor power, as a connection needs to be opened to the DB, the commands need to be executed, returning information needs to be processed, and finally the connection needs to be closed. For a time-sensitive operation like signing up for a site or service, the provider usually opts to run these DB operations in real time, but other, less-sensitive operations may be scheduled to avoid excessive DB open/close requests.\n", "Q: Does apps backup on iCloud consume space? iCloud comes with free 5GB space.

I'm primarily a PC/*nix user and just have a MacBook Pro for the occasional iOS dev work.  Rather than clutter up my desk with multiple screens, keyboards, etc, I use my Windows box as my primary and do full screen remote connections to the other machines.  Works great for the various Windows and *nix boxes I need to access.  However, the Mac only allows me to connect (via VNC) at the resolution of the built-in screen.  The built-in screen is pretty low res compared to my large desktop monitor on the machine I'm connecting from.  Currently I can either work inside a small window, or stretch it to fit (making the pixels huge).  What I'd like to do is have a remote session at the full resolution of the machine I'm connecting from.  Any good solutions for this use case?\n\nA: Mac OS doesn't have a terminal services centric design, so the loginwindow ties the remote screen resolution tightly to the actual physical screen dimensions.\nSome easy solutions are to connect the Mac to a display (or a display dongle that simulates a plug and play monitor of a resolution of your choosing to the OS) so that the OS allocates a larger pixel boundary when the user logs in.\nAlternatively, you could get software like SwitchResX to force the display to a size of your choosing.\n", "Q: Can podcasts be grouped or organised in iTunes?

Is this true? \nThat wouldn't make any sense at all. So Find My Mac is basically useless if someone has an ethernet cable..\n\nA: Find My Mac needs two things to work:\n\n\n*\n\n*An working internet connection, so that the Mac can contact Apple's servers and register its location.\n\n*A means of determining the Mac's location.\n\n\nFor the first condition, either a wired ethernet or Wi-Fi connection will suffice. For the second condition, only Wi-Fi will work, because the Wi-Fi radio is used to triangulate a position, based on Apple's database of Wi-Fi networks around the world. Essentially, you can take the names of Wi-Fi networks around you and their relative signal strengths, and Apple's database (and others like it) can determine where you are, within a relatively small radius.\nWhile you can get a rough geolocation based on an IP address, it's not nearly precise enough to be useful for locating a Mac, hence why an ethernet connection alone is not enough (it could probably determine the city the Mac is in, but nothing more concrete).\nA few useful things to keep in mind based on this:\n\n\n*\n\n*A Mac can be located if the Wi-Fi adapter is turned on, but not connected to any networks and the ethernet connection has an internet connection. You can test this easily enough yourself.\n\n*If your Wi-Fi is on, but not connected (nor is the ethernet) to the internet, Find My Mac still won't work.\n\n*Turning off Wi-Fi will disable Find My Mac, regardless of whether there's any ethernet connection. However the Find My Mac service does cache recent locations (although I'm not sure for how long).\n\n\nSo, for the best chance at recovering a lost Mac, make sure that the Wi-Fi adapter hasn't been turned off. If you need to do so (i.e. getting on a plane, etc.), be sure to turn it back on when possible.\n", "Q: 3 (2 monitors + Ethernet adapter) devices to 2 Thunderbolt ports on a Retina MacBook Pro? There are 2 Thunderbolt ports, but I have 3 devices. Is there a way to attach all 3?\nI've read stuff about \"daisy-chaining\" but I don't know what it means.\n\nA: How Daisy Chaining Works\nDaisy chaining is connecting multiple devices in series, as in this diagram:\n\nNote that this shows some disk drives, but they could be any Thunderbolt devices.\nEach device in the chain (except for the last) needs two Thunderbolt ports — one to connect to the downstream devices (those closer in the chain to the Mac) and one for the upstream (to pass the data on to the devices further along the chain).\nAdditionally, each chain supports a maximum of six devices, and there can only be one non-Thunderbolt display, and it must be at the end of the chain.\nMaking Your Situation Feasible\nBecause of these limitations, you won't be able to connect the devices you have using Thunderbolt alone. Unfortunately Apple's ethernet adapter doesn't have multiple ports for passthrough, so you can only use it at the end of a chain. If your displays were Thunderbolt based, it would be do-able, but it sounds like they're not.\nThe best suggestion I can give you is to use the HDMI port on your Retina MBP to connect one of your monitors (this will work if it has either a DVI or HDMI input), however this limits the resolution to 1920x1200, so for hi-res panels (like those found on some 27\" and 30\" displays), you won't be getting the full benefit of the display.\nIf you're still stuck, there are USB 3 ethernet adapters available now that will do full gigabit. There might be a bit more overhead than the Thunderbolt adapter, but it's better than nothing.\n\nA: A daisy chain is just another way to say connecting electrical devices, computers, dvd players, toaster ovens, etc. together in series. In other words, thing A connects to the wall. Thing B connects to thing A, thing C connects to thing B, and thing D connects to thing C...etc. etc. \n", "Q: getting filters to use reply-to rather than the originating email address I'm receiving emails that are send to me by one email address (a web server)- which I don't want -  and have a reply-to field set to a users email- that I do want.\nI'd like to auto reply to these emails so the users' know I have received them, but the filter is sending the reply back to the originator (which is a no-reply address) and not using the reply-to field address, whee I'd like it to go.\nDoes anyone know how to force Mac Mail to use the reply-to field when replying to a message?\n\nA: You could use the \nRules in Mail and\nWhen message arrives from ??\nForward to: someones.email.com\nwith predefined and automated message text that you write only once.\n\n", "Q: Run Makefile from Finder I often travel using Finder in the source directories of various project (LaTeX articles, programming stuff) for which the compilation is piloted by a Makefile.\nI was wondering if there is a simple way (Service menu, Automator whatever) to invoke the corresponding command (make) in the good directory directoly from Finder (right-click something). \nI'm running OS X 10.8. \nThanks by advance for your suggestions\n\nA: You could use a function like this:\nfmake() {\n  cd \"$(osascript -e 'tell application \"Finder\"\n      POSIX path of (target of Finder window 1 as alias)\n  end tell' 2> /dev/null)\"\n  make && make install\n}\n\nOr save a function just for the cd command and use history-search-backward to run something like cdf && make && make install.\nOr open Automator, choose the Service template, set the input type to no input, and add a Run AppleScript action like this:\ntry\n    tell application \"Finder\"\n        POSIX path of (target of Finder window 1 as alias)\n    end tell\n    tell application \"Terminal\"\n        do script \"cd \" & quoted form of result & \" && make && make install\"\n        activate\n    end tell\nend\n\nWithout the try block Automator would show an error dialog if the script exits with an error.\n\nA: Admitted, this is a clumsy way but maybe better than nothing:\ncreate a text file named makeit.command and just put one line of text into it:\nmake\n\nThen chomod the file 755\nchmod 755 makeit.command \n\nIf you want to run a make, drag/copy it to that folder and then double click it.\n\nA: I like Lauri Ranta's AppleScript answer.

Here is a link to an Automator workflow saved as a Service that runs the make command on the directory selected in the Finder: \nRun Make\nI tried this new service of mine and I didn't like it because sometimes you may want to do the shell command \"make\" and other times you may want to do the shell command \"make && make install\", or you may want to build a different target \"make fullbuild\" or something.  That's why I was thinking that a service called \"Connect to Selected Directory\" would be best.  \n\nA: I tried adding #!/usr/bin/make -f as the first line of Makefile and making it executable but it does not run in the correct folder. So I've settled for a solution along the lines of the answer by The-Dood.\nOpen a terminal and go to the folder where you have you project and Makefile, then type this:\ncat <<EOF > Makeit\nmake -C `dirname $_`\necho 'Press enter to continue'\nread\nEOF\nchmod +x Makeit\n\nNow double-clicking Makeit should invoke make on the same folder. You can add any other arguments when calling make or edit Makeit at will.\nThis solution works but it may not be terribly convenient because you need a copy of Makeit in each folder.\n", "Q: How to tell if Macbook is using 802.11ac I just got a new Macbook Air and a new Airport Extreme, both of which support 802.11ac.\nIs there an easy way to tell if my Macbook Air is connecting to the Airport Extreme via 802.11ac?

There is no way to connect to an iOS device by Thunderbolt that I know of.\nConnecting just the iPad display to the computer would be as close to impossible as to make it unfeasible. The displays in iOS devices use the DSI protocol, so would need custom-made circuit boars for the connectors, and custom low-level drivers to interface with the GPU, and the OS.\nThe only truly high-DPI (>120) monitors that I've seen are for medical applications (e.g. this one), and they only give quotes when you contact them.\nSo for the moment, Wifi display apps such as Air Display are the best solution for Retina displays.

For the last problem I mentioned, you might be able to ask a question in the comments about how it looks before you buy anything. The author says that the pictures look nothing like the real thing, but it never hurts to ask. You don't want to get stuck with a monitor that the screen looks old at a glance (one of those that has lots of glare and looks kind of flimsy), even if it is high resolution.

I have a lot of useless files on my hardrive and I need to clear some of them out:  some of said files will go into the trash with no problem, Some of them let me put them in the trash, but dont actually ever leave my harddrive, and last but not least there are the stubborn ones that won't even give me the option of putting them in the trash. Why is this happening? How can I fix it? What can I do to prevent this from happening again? \n\nA: Their probably not being moved because you don't have the permission or they're currently in use. The sure fire way to delete files like this is by:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Terminal from /Applications/Utilities\n\n*Type sudo rm [file path]\nYou can even drag and drop files into terminal to have all their paths listed, so you can delete them all in one shot. Be sure you have a good backup since if you delete something that is needed, you won't get asked twice before the system deletes it. There is no trash can or undo with sudo rm\n\nA: One question about the \"useless\" files you want to delete: are they system files or are they files you created? If they are locked or you do not have the premission to delete them, I see two reasons for that: \n\n\n*\n\n*The files belongs to the system and you should not delete them!!!\n\n*The files permissions are broken, you should repare them with a tool like Onyx (there are other tools to do it)\n\n\nOnce you checked that, and repair the permissions, try again. If the trash still do not empty, try to empty it while pressing the \"option\" key on the keyboard (\"alt\" key). This will force to empty the trash. \nAnd another hint, the files you want to delete might be locked. To unlock a file, select it (outside of the trash) and look for the file's information (press \"command-i\"). There is a box to check to lock-unlock the file on the bottome of the window. \n", "Q: installation stuck in a loop due to damaged HD Right off the bat I'll admit it was stupid to jump into trying to install a new version of OS X to the only partition without having taken adequate  precautions (no backups or recovery disks), but unfortunately it's done.  (the failed installation attempt, not the installation itself!)\nI'm on a mid-2011 MBP that was running Lion. I download the installer for the latest OS X beta version to my HD and started installation process from there. The system rebooted and the  installation started, but after 1 minute into the estimated 43 minutes  for the installation to complete, I get an \"Install Failed\" message: \"OS  X could not be installed on your computer. The OS X upgrade couldn't be  started because the disk Lion DP GM is damaged and can't be repaired.  After your computer restarts, back up your data, erase your disk, and  try installing again. Click Restart to restart your computer and try  installing again.\"\nRestarting just repeats the process and the same problem recurs. I went  into \"Disk Utility\" from the Installer's menu, and trying to verify the  offending volume returns \"This disk needs to be repaired. Click Repair  Disk\". Unfortunately the \"Repair Disk\" option stays greys out.\nIs there any way I can \"revoke\" the installation process (via the  Terminal perhaps?) and get back to my previous set up with Lion (without  losing data, obviously), so I can start over the right way this time?\nAny advice is appreciated.\nUpdate:\nI'm not able to back up my main volume (\"Lion DP GM\") with Disk Utility. It barely starts before I get the following error:\n\nUnable to create \"Lion DP GM.dmg\" (Input/output error)\n\nI tried booting in recovery mode and reinstalling Lion, but it didn't work. Under the disk \"Lion DP GM\" where I would install it, it says \n\nThis disk is locked\n\nWhen the OS installer is running, I can see - via Terminal - the contents of my main volume under /Volumes/Image Volume, whereas in Recovery Mode it's under /Volumes/Lion DP GM \nUnless someone has some bright ideas how to restore things back to how they were, I would at least like to attempt backing up the entire \"Lion DP GM\" disk to an external disk via Terminal (since Disk Utility failed). What command would be the best way to attempt this?\nUpdate #2:\nIn the end I copied just the bare essentials to an external drive via Terminal, which didn't cause any problems. Then I erased the whole partition, and did a USB installation, which completed successfully. Disk Utility on the new version of Mac OS X is no longer complaining of HD errors (although I'm not sure whether that means I'm in the clear or not).\n\nA: If you haven't already made backups, you can start up from the recovery partition and save a disk image of the main OS X volume (or other volumes you use) to a different drive in Disk Utility.\nThe first thing I'd try would be to do an upgrade install of 10.7 by choosing Reinstall OS X without erasing anything first. If that wouldn't work, I'd do a clean reinstall and restore files manually.\nSee these Apple KB articles:\n\n\n*\n\n*Mac OS X v10.5, v10.6: How to back up and restore your files\n\n*OS X Mountain Lion: Reinstall OS X\n\n*OS X Mountain Lion: Erase and reinstall OS X\n\nA: Since your install didn't complete, it's entirely likely you still have a Mountain Lion recovery HD and can simply wipe the entire drive and start over with Mountain Lion to ensure it's really a hardware issue (or rule out a hardware issue).\n\n\n*\n\n*OS X Mountain Lion: Erase and reinstall OS X - http://support.apple.com/kb/ph11273\nJust power it off, press the power button and hold the option key to boot into Recovery HD. From there you use Disk Utility to erase the entire drive (repartition it if needed). You could also connect the Mac to another computer in target disk mode and repair / erase the volume and then go back to recovery HD (or run Mountain Lion installer from a second Mac with yours still in target mode).\n", "Q: twitter client for iPhone 3G and iOS 4.2.1 I am running iPhone 3G with iOS 4.2.1.

I create a bunch of Titles but seems like I have to reposition that title to the bottom of the video manually for each Title and it's very cumbersome. Am I doing it right?\nThanks\n\nA: There are two different ways to do this - the way you are doing it, and the other is by using a text track in QuickTime.\nThe advantages of the way you are doing it:\n\n\n*\n\n*You get more exact control over the font\n\n*You can ensure they show up\n\n*It works 100% of the time.\n\n\nThe advantages of doing it the other way (with a text track in QuickTime):\n\n\n*\n\n*The captions are optional, and can be turned on or off by the viewer.\n\n*A single video file can be captioned in different languages, and those captions can be selected by the user.\n\n", "Q: Notification when a special AppleID/device connects to internet? I like to know when my wife's iPhone is connected to wifi (Internet). It's for good! I'm not spying or anything! She is in a place where she doesn't have celular data connection. I like to know when her iPhone is connected to Internet via wifi so that we can communicate. Is there an app/website/service for this? I'm sure it's possible somehow using AppleID. I can think of two non-optimal ways now.\n\n\n*\n\n*I can login to icloud.com using her AppleID user/pass and use Find My iPhone service to see if the phone is connected.\n\n*I can send a message via iMessage and check whether the message is delivered or not.\n\n\nBoth of these are polling methods. I'm looking for an interrupt based solution. Computer Engineers know what I'm talking about.\n\nA: By default, iOS devices only connect to Apple's push notification servers when they connect to the network, so you would need to interact with that system as a paid developer or consumer of a MDM solution that allows you to send notifications and retrieve status when messages are sent and received to that phone.\nIt's not a hard engineering problem, but you need to get software installed on her device by jailbreaking or by means that Apple approves. An app that registers for a local notification and attempts to send a http request to your web server is all you'd need to track each poll interval that she has an internet connection.\nRealistically, you will probably end up asking here to reply to a message you send and trusting that iMessage will send a \"delivered\" message to your phones promptly after her phone registers to the APNS servers and gets the messages that are queued for her device/account.\n", "Q: Setting defaults for Magic Mouse When I log on the Guest user, the Magic Mouse settings are not as I want them to be. E.g., I would always like the right click enabled and the tracking speed set to fast, but these settings default to unwanted values. So every time after login on Guest, I must change these settings manually.\nIs there a way to change the defaults setting for the Magic Mouse so that every new user will get these changed defaults ?\n\nA: This is a two step process. The system make all new accounts from this template:\n/System/Library/User Template\n\nUnless you need to only change a specific localization, you'll be putting files into /System/Library/User Template/Non_localized/Library/Preferences\nThe two step process is knowing where to change a file and what change to make.\nI don't have an answer to the second part (no Magic Mouse handy), but you might be able to do that part yourself. If you make a new account and change only that mouse preference and dig through the ~/Library/Preferences to isolate the file(s) that encode that change (sort them by date and the newest files should be the ones you changed to configure the mouse). Second, you need to copy that file into the default user template so that when the system makes a new account (guest account or any new account), that user gets the modified mouse settings you have copied into the template to replace the default values for that setting.\nAn alternate method is to look inside the file(s) to see if the settings can be written easily by a sudo defaults command:\n\n\n*\n\n*How can I prevent the iCloud dialog from showing up for new users?\n\nA: First of all you may need to unhide the hiden files so open terminal and run those commands :\ndefaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles TRUE\n\nkillall Finder\n\nTo switch back, do the same but substitute FALSE for TRUE. \nNow \nLogin to your guest account, there set chrome as your default browser (or even Firefox) \nThen do not logout !

I did a backup of my hdd disk (as I always do with Time Machine) and used the disk utility to restore that backup to my ssd disk. The restore worked perfectly, but Finder is always crashing and restarting and crashing... So I googled a lot and tried to create a second user account. There the problem does not occur. So it seems to be a account-specific problem. But how can I see where the problem is? I don't want to use the new account, because all settings and preferences are gone.\nThe crash report:\nhttp://pastebin.com/qQjJedDD\n\nA: You could just try reinstalling OS X from the recovery partition (see http://support.apple.com/kb/PH10763). It fixed a similar issue I had where different applications started crashing on launch. It keeps most user files and settings in place, so it might not fix account-specific issues though.\nOr if you don't want to recreate settings, try copying directories like ~/Library/Preferences/ and ~/Library/Containers/ to the new account.\n\nA: You could try and move the finder preference file found at ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.finder.plist \nout of the\n~/Library/Preferences/ folder and do an immediate relaunch of the finder.\nThe pref could have a corruption or Possibly ( a guess ) hold a reference that is linked to the old HD that is causing the problem.\nYou need to do the relaunch quickly or the setting in memory may get written to file before you do.\nTo relaunch you can hold the 'alt' key and click on the Finder dock item. You should then see the Relaunch Menu item.\n\nThe finder will disappear and the come back in its default settings.\nA tip so you know you have a new finder setup is to sort the desktop by for example name. When the finder comes back up the sort should not be on and the folders/files on the desktop will not be ordered but dispersed.\nThere are other ways to Relaunch the finder but it is best you try that first.\n\nA: Same SSD change, same Finder crashes.\nI solved my crash by one reboot in Safe mode. \n", "Q: Will I be able to upgrade to iOS 7 on iPod Touch 4G? I bought an iPod touch 4G and I'm looking forward to iOS 7... until I read on this site that it is only compatible with the iPod Touch 5G. Does that mean that I'm \"Out in the woods\" for security? Or does this just mean I don't get the new Airdrop, iTunes Radio, and camera filters?\nI don't mind that much that I don't get the new look (although if I could, it would be nice), but I just want my device to be secure.\nThe thing that I don't get about this is Apple supported the iPhone 3GS up until now (It is three models old), but when another device is one model old, \"No! We can't support this device!\" Apple could be changing it's views on how to run their business so they make more money, but I like my iPod Touch just fine. In fact, I like the older design better and I can't see running out to the store to spend 300 bucks to get a design I don't like as much just to have a security upgrade.\n\nA: Towards the end of the WWDC keynote, Craig Federighi showed a slide listing the devices on which iOS 7 would be supported. In the official keynote video, this occurs around the 1:54 mark.\nHere’s a picture of the slide:\n\nIt reads:\n\niPhone 4 and later\n  iPad 2 and later\n  iPad mini\n  iPod touch (5th generation)\n\nThis matches the images and descriptions on the pages for iOS 7 for Apple’s website, so this seems to be the canonical list.\nIt’s possible that Apple will add support for the 4th generation iPod touch between now and the release, but currently it looks like you won’t be able to upgrade.\n\nA: The public page for iOS 7 shows that the iOS is designed to run on the iPod touch 16/32/64 (and they separate the low end model from the higher two) and there is zero reference to generations.\nFrom the information I've seen that Apple released, we can only assume iOS 7 will support the current for-sale models:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.apple.com/ios/ios7/features/\n\n*http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1353\n\n*http://store.apple.com/us/browse/home/shop_ipod/family/ipod_touch_16gb\n\n*http://store.apple.com/us/browse/home/shop_ipod/family/ipod_touch\nUnless you have a reference to some other details, it's probably too early to expect a detailed list of what models will run an announced. We can edit this as new information arrives or the iOS 7 gets released when there will clearly be an article listing in detail what devices can upgrade and what shipping features support what models.\nAlso, Apple has a history of issuing security updates for several prior versions of OS and there's nothing concrete to point at. The article you link seems to be reading the tea leaves as I do (looking at the physical pictures to identify the generation of iPod touch, but until there's a public announcement, it's anyone's opinion that can be offered.)\n\nA: Maybe, but the iPod Touch 4th gen has 256 MB of RAM while all other devices for iOS 7 have at least 512 MB of RAM... If you want, wait a while or send feedback to Apple, or just buy a new iDevice.\n", "Q: How can I avoid seeing an Apple ID password field on my iPhone 5?

The phone should remember the password for that given action and not bother you again.\nOr perhaps your password has been corrupted so try going to Settings/iTunes&App Store, tapping on the box that says \"AppleID: youremail@some.com\", and signing out and then back in again. \n\nA: I've had good luck with the following steps.\n\n\n*\n\n*Sign out of all services that had that Apple ID stored (clearly we can assume you've checked the account and password on another device and aren't just entering the wrong password again and again).\n\n*Go to preferences and set the date and time (best is if it's connected to the internet and can get a good automatic sync from a time server).\n\n*Sign in to iCloud first with that Apple ID (since it populates several other entries by default in many cases).\n\n*Sign in to all services you wish to use for that Apple ID.\n\n", "Q: Backup jailbreak I had a jailbreak on my iPod 5 (6.1.2) but then I upgraded it to 6.1.3 and I had backed it up when it was jailbroken and when i had restored it it asked if I wanted to use a backup and I used the one I did while I was jailbroken and now I have battery percentage on my iPod 5.

And you can make it work through most firewalls if you're both using Messages. Messages will broker the handshake to start the session and then turn it over to the screen sharing app.\nStart up Messages and make sure Screen Sharing is enabled:\n\nFind your buddy in your contact list in Messages and click on them.

I recently attempted to follow this tutorial to upgrade my device (iPhone 4) to iOS 7 without being a developer or registering a UDID. \nI loaded and installed iOS 7 and got to the configuration screen. However efter attempting to go through the configuration process it says:\n\nWe’re unable to complete your activation. This device is not\n  registered as part of the iPhone Developer Program. If you are a\n  member of the Program, please register your device in the iPhone\n  Developer Program Portal.\n\nThe problem is this is also what it says on iTunes so there is no way to access it from the computer. \nHow can I downgrade back to 6.1.3? I suppose I could register as a paid developer for iOS 7, but that involves forking over $99 and I'm not even sure I could revert to iOS 6 even then.\nAdditional Information:\n\n\n*\n\n*I started with an unjailbroken iOS 6.1.3.\n\n*I downloaded iOS 7.0 CDMA for iPhone 4 from here\n\n*I have Verizon\n\n*I Have the iOS 6.1.3 version for my iPhone downloaded from here, but I am unsure how I can restore from it because iTunes will not let me do anything because of the above mentioned message. \nUpdate: I managed to entere recovery mode by pressing \"power\" for 3 seconds, \"home\" and power for 10 seconds, and just \"home\" until it had entered recovery mode. I have then begun to restore the phone which requires iOS 6.1.3 to download again through iTunes. Note that the first time you restore it may not work. Mine still booted to iOS 7 until I tried again.\n\nA: It is likely the baseband was updated along with the OS, but if you have a good backup of the phone, I might try restoring it in recovery mode.\n\n\n*\n\n*Power off the iPhone\n\n*Plug in the iPhone to your computer via USB.\n\n*Press and hold the \"power\" button with one hand for 3 seconds\n\n*Hold down the \"home\" button as well for ten more seconds\n\n*Release \"power\" button but continue to hold \"home\" button until device enters recovery mode.\n\n\nI don't have a device to test this and it might not work. You might have to get a jailbreak tool to modify the OS and/or firmware of the device and then restore 6.1.3 on it.\n\nA: Once you upgrade to iOS7 from iOS6, you will not be able to downgrade from iOS7 back to iOS6. You can downgrade the beta, but not the production release.\nCaveat: According to this post, as long as Apple is still signing iOS6 releases, you can downgrade. Once the signing stops, the downgrades will also.\nEDIT: According to iMore, as of today, you can no longer downgrade.\n\nA: [Copied as an answer here since this question \"Will it be possible to downgrade from iOS7(Final) to iOS 6.1.3?\" was marked as duplicate and bmike suggested that it be moved here to provide additional information]\nYou can downgrade by following the steps here (it's for iOS 7 beta, but will work for the release version too).\nKeep in mind that Apple usually stops signing the older version of iOS shortly after the release of a new version. Until the time Apple continues signing iOS 6, you will be able to downgrade the OS. Nobody can predict when Apple would stop signing iOS 6.\nOnce Apple stops signing iOS 6, it wouldn't be possible to downgrade (unless you look or wait for jailbreaks, hacks and such solutions, which would depend on the iPhone model you have).\n", "Q: using OSX server in conjunction with Windows server We have a mixed shop, about 60% windows and 40% mac.  The Mac users use the Windows server for sharing files with all users and for access to the internet.  I would like to have a mac server for running backups of the Macs and storing Mac software.  Is it possible to configure things so that the Macs are connected to both servers and using each one for the above-mentioned purposes, using the same cables?  Hang one server off the other, maybe?\n\nA: Yes - servers work well together and you could configure things in just about any manner you wish.\nAs long as you can map out on paper how you want things to connect, you can configure the server and clients to connect to either or both servers at the same time. You'll have different shares on each server for many cases, but you could have one directory run for both servers so people's names and passwords were centrally managed and not different on each server.\n", "Q: How to troubleshoot 802.11ac bandwidth problems I have a new Macbook Air with 802.11ac, and a new Airport Extreme with 802.11ac.  I'm trying to transfer a large file across my LAN (I have a network drive attached to network via wired ethernet).\nIf I transfer the file over (wired) ethernet, I'm seeing transfer speeds of 60-70MB/sec, which seems reasonable.  But if I transfer the same file via wi-fi, I'm only seeing rates of 15-17MB/sec.  If have tried to remove as many variables as possible by connecting my computer to the same cable that is connected to the Airport Extreme, and in that case I'm seeing the fast (60-70MB/sec) speeds, but the same transfer over wi-fi -- even if my laptop is right next to the Airport Extreme -- is much slower.  I have confirmed that the laptop is connecting to the Airport Extreme via 802.11ac.\nMy assumption is that 802.11ac operating properly should have produced transfer speeds just as fast as what I was seeing over wired ethernet.  What am I missing?  Is it possible there's a software bug, or perhaps a configuration problem?\n\nA: I would run /System/Library/CoreServices/Wireless Diagnostics to see if the tool can pick up on any problems with channel or interference. The drop off in speed seems too large to account for a switch from wired ethernet MTU to the overhead for WiFi, but it could be something that will get tuned with an update.\nThe good news is you get free support within 90 days of purchase so you could call AppleCare or visit a genius bar to review the Wireless Diagnostic scans and have them escalate the case to engineering at no cost to you if this slowdown persists. I'm sure they would be very interested in a test case where the hardware and software isn't working as expected.\nIn the mean time, you might have more details on SNR and Transmit Rate that might point to a reason why your transfers are slower over wireless than over wired.\n\nYou can even see how this tool can be used in action in this answer - where I turned on a microwave to show that there was some interference from that device.\n\nA: AnandTech has done some troubleshooting on this issue and has found some problems with the TCP/IP stack in Mac OS X.  Hopefully Apple can release a software patch soon to fix the issue.\nhttp://anandtech.com/show/7085/the-2013-macbook-air-review-13inch/10\n", "Q: Web access via Ethernet broken but Airport to same router works fine I've seen lots of questions asking what to do when Ethernet works and Wi-Fi doesn't, but I seem to have the opposite problem.  System details are as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*2009 Mac Mini (Intel Core Duo)\n\n*OS X 10.6.8 (Snow Leopard)\n\n*Fairly\ntypical home network, with Centurylink ADSL service coming through an\nActiontec DSL modem into a Buffalo wireless router/firewall/base station.\n\n*Other computers in the house connect wirelessly to the Buffalo router which is configured to hand out IP addresses via DHCP and forward DNS requests to the DNS server (I'm using Google).  One of the Ethernet ports on the router is connected to the uplink port on a Netgear minihub, and two Macs (the Mini and an old G4 tower) are connected to that minihub.\n\n\nWith this setup my Mini can see the router in Network Preferences, and seems to be getting the DNS server address correctly via DHCP.  I can ping outside servers by IP address or by name and get response times under 100 ms.  Yet WWW access is incredibly slow.  Most pages that I open in Safari will take 5-10 minutes to load, if at all--usually the progress bar gets halfway through the title of the page and then just freezes.  This is a recent development (but of course I can't think of anything that might have changed to trigger it).\nIf I activate Airport and change the order of preferred networks in the Network Preferences pane to Airport first, Ethernet second, all of a sudden everything works fine.\nI realize there is room for some hardware diagnostics to be done here.  I can take the minihub out of the equation by connecting the Mini directly to the Buffalo router, and I can try different Ethernet cables.  Beyond that I'm not sure what to do.  What can be done at the command line or via diagnostic software to see where the request packets are going and why nothing's coming back?  I'm really baffled as to why ping to a server by name works fine, but Safari doesn't--my limited understanding of TCP/IP says that if the former works, the latter should too.  And why does wi-fi work fine, but a hard-wired connection straight to the router doesn't?\nEDIT: Here's the output of ifconfig -v with Airport active and Ethernet inactive.\nlo0: flags=8049<UP,LOOPBACK,RUNNING,MULTICAST> mtu 16384\n    inet6 ::1 prefixlen 128 \n    inet6 fe80::1%lo0 prefixlen 64 scopeid 0x1 \n    inet 127.0.0.1 netmask 0xff000000 \ngif0: flags=8010<POINTOPOINT,MULTICAST> mtu 1280\nstf0: flags=0<> mtu 1280\nen0: flags=8822<BROADCAST,SMART,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST> mtu 1500\n    ether 00:25:4b:bc:f6:48 \n    media: autoselect\n    status: inactive\nfw0: flags=8863<UP,BROADCAST,SMART,RUNNING,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST> mtu 4078\n    lladdr 00:25:4b:ff:fe:bc:f6:48 \n    media: autoselect <full-duplex>\n    status: inactive\nen1: flags=8863<UP,BROADCAST,SMART,RUNNING,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST> mtu 1500\n    ether 00:25:00:f9:4c:d1 \n    inet6 fe80::225:ff:fef9:4cd1%en1 prefixlen 64 scopeid 0x6 \n    inet 192.168.11.10 netmask 0xffffff00 broadcast 192.168.11.255\n    media: autoselect\n    status: active\nvmnet8: flags=8863<UP,BROADCAST,SMART,RUNNING,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST> mtu 1500\n    ether 00:50:56:c0:00:08 \n    inet 192.168.186.1 netmask 0xffffff00 broadcast 192.168.186.255\nvmnet1: flags=8863<UP,BROADCAST,SMART,RUNNING,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST> mtu 1500\n    ether 00:50:56:c0:00:01 \n    inet 192.168.37.1 netmask 0xffffff00 broadcast 192.168.37.255\n\nEDIT AGAIN: Here's the en0 section from ifconfig -v with Airport inactive and Ethernet active.\nen0: flags=8863<UP,BROADCAST,SMART,RUNNING,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST> mtu 1500\n    ether 00:25:4b:bc:f6:48 \n    inet6 fe80::225:4bff:febc:f648%en0 prefixlen 64 scopeid 0x4 \n    inet 192.168.11.200 netmask 0xffffff00 broadcast 192.168.11.255\n    media: autoselect (10baseT/UTP <half-duplex>)\n    status: active\n\nEDIT #3: Here's the output from netstat -i for en0 with Airport inactive and Ethernet active.\nen0   1500  <Link#4>    00:25:4b:bc:f6:48   352450  1385   289436     0     0\nen0   1500  alex-chambe fe80:4::225:4bff:   352450     -   289436     -     -\nen0   1500  192.168.11    192.168.11.200    352450     -   289436     -     -\n\n\nA: It could be an duplex mismatch problem: small packets, like the ones ping sends, get through while large packets (as generated when browsing the web) get delayed or lost, which leads to poor performance.\nThis problem may arise either when the autonegotiation process between your Mac Mini and the Netgear minihub fails or when speed/duplex mode are set manually and don't match at both ends.\nTo solve the problem you first need to check the Ethernet settings: \n\n\n*\n\n*Open System Preferences>Network, select Ethernet from the list on the left and click Advanced....\n\n*Select the Hardware tab.\n\n\nThen:\n\n\n*\n\n*If configure is set to \"Automatically\":\n\nautonegotiation is on.

Switching between applications is easy with command-tab.\nSwitching between tabs is easy with command-} or control-tab.\nSwitching between separate windows within an application is easy with command-`.\nHowever, that last one doesn't seem to work with Google Chrome (Version 27.0.1453.110) on OS X 10.8.4. Is there a leopard shortcut specific for Chrome to switch between different windows?\n\nA: For those using Snow Leopard 10.6.8, these options can be set under the OSX \"System Preferences\" > Keyboard > \"Keyboard Shortcuts\" Tab > \"Keyboard and Text Input\".\nApparently, by default Cmd+` is set to \"Move focus to next window in appl...\". However, this shortcut doesn't work for me because my keyboard is Japanese, and therefore I need to press Shift to access the `. It turns out that OSX always receives a Shift+Cmd+@. So, what I did was to replace that shortcut with Cmd+@ and now it works.\nHope that helps people having similar issues.\nPS: You can use the \"Move focus to active or next window\", which defaults to Ctrl+F4, Shift+Ctrl+F4 for the previous window.\n\nA: This issue is so annoying for me, and today I finally got it resolved! So, in hope to help some poor soul like myself, I want to share what I did:\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to System Preference --> Keyboard --> Shortcuts tab --> Move focus to next window\n\n*Set it to ⌘ + `\n\nA: @Hugo Chrome allows to set up more users to get more \"environments\" inside your chrome (bookmarks, opened tabs, session and so forth). it's very useful to split your business and private browsing.\nSo, ⌘ Cmd-Shift-M is very useful. :)\n\nA: My case was slightly different - one chrome window was normal ( not maximized ) and another chrome windows was maximized. The above solution cmd + ' didn't work in my case.\nWhen one chrome window is maximized it gets its own space, found that i can use control key + left or right arrow keys to switch back between these 2 chrome windows.\nHope it helps.\n\nA: Interestingly, the ⌘ Cmd-` shortcut doesn't work for me (Chrome 38.0 on Mac OS X 10.9.50).\nBut ⌘ Cmd-F1 seems to work instead (and works for other apps too).\nThough, again, it doesn't work if the windows are spread across desktops/spaces.\n\nA: Control + F4 will switch back & forth between open chrome browsers but only after configuring the Function keys to only work with Fn key in System Preferences > keyboard options. \n\nA: So I found what was , for me , the real problem.\nI went into System Preferences\" > Keyboard > \"Keyboard Shortcuts\" Tab > \"Keyboard and Text Input and I found this:\n\nSorry for Italian lang.\nStart from bottom, third row.\nHave attention for cmd + ' at first it was cmd + `\nSo I simply changed it and now It works perfectly. \nHope this can help.\n\nA: ⌘ Cmd+` works for me with the same versions of Chrome and OS X, so it might be something specific to your installation.\nYou could try temporarily resetting Chrome's preferences or disabling extensions. Or change the shortcut from System Preferences or test if it works on a different account.\n\nA: To show Chrome windows (this applies to other apps as well) press: Control-↓ (arrow down).\nActive windows of the current application would be shown larger (if you've multiple monitors, they will show on other screen as well), including minimized at the bottom. \nFrom there, use arrow keys to switch between different windows and confirm your selection with Enter or Space (to switch between all apps press Tab). It should work for multiple displays as well. Hit Escape to cancel the selection.\nAbove tested on El Capitan (10.11).\n\nA: To switch between users in Chrome, use ⌘ Cmd-Shift-M and then use your arrow keys to select the user you want and hit Enter.\nThis isn't as fast as a key combination normally is but it is quicker than using the mouse. To see where this key combination comes from see Chrome's support forum.\n\nA: There will be ShortCuts “Alt+PageUp” & “Alt+PageDown” available in the next version of our extension TabIt - NewTab (precisely in v15.01). They will allow to switch between neighbouring Chrome windows.\n\nA: In order for any suggested keyboard shortcuts to work, none of the windows can be in Full Screen.  To exit Full Screen, choose View > Exit Full Screen.\n\nA: If you have Chrome Windows maximized (ie. each Chrome window is in its own Spaces), the keyboard shortcut to toggle between Spaces will do the job for you. By default keyboard shortcut to toggle between Spaces is control + right arrow key or control + left arrow key. If this doesn't work, check for keyboard shortcuts on your mac under System Preferences > Keyboard > Mission Control and attributes 'Move left a space' and 'Move right a space'.\n\nA: You can toggle between windows in the same Space/desktop, and also across all of them.\nTo toggle between windows of the same application in the same space use  Cmd ⌘  +  `  (\"Move focus to the next window\").\nHowever, what shows windows in all spaces from the same app is the \"Application Windows\" shortcut:  Ctrl ⌃  +  ↓  which shows all of them:\n\nNow you can either use keyboard arrows or click the one you want to transition to.\nPro tip\nWhat's very helpful to me is using configuring a hot corner so I don't even need to press keys.\n(Preferences -> Desktop & Screensaver -> Hot Corners):\n\n\nA: [MAC users] When you have several google sessions open or other applications as vscode with different projects per window, you can switch between them using COMMAND + TAB after that UP or DOWN to choose.\n\nA: I had the same problem and when I went in to system preferences and keyboard shortcuts the shortcut was set to cmd+. When I marked it and gave it the same shortcut, It suddenly works just fine:)\n\nA: I just do control+left/right arrow. Not sure if this only works because I have the swipe between apps enabled with my apple mouse...\nUPDATE\nI found that the problem was apparently in chrome itself(for me) and that to make it work you need the chrome windows to be minimized for it to work. The problem might be in the shortcut itself, but \"cmd+`\" does work with other applications. So, the solution I'm currently using is just to minimize and then manually increasing the window size to fit the full screen.\nFound this answer from https://superuser.com/a/1177594. If this isn't the problem, try the other solutions.\n\nA: Review the mission control shortcuts for switching between OSX spaces.

I can't stay on it & need to roll back to Mountain Lion. Any ways of doing that? Please help!\nI originally installed Mountain Lion & Mavericks through the Mac App Store.\n\nA: If you backed up your Mac before installing OS X Mavericks please take a look at:\n\n\n*\n\n*OS X: About OS X Recovery (http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4718)\n\n\nIf you want to do a clean install, take a look at:\n\n\n*\n\n*OS X Mountain Lion: Erase and reinstall OS X (http://support.apple.com/kb/PH11273)\n\n*OS X Mountain Lion: Reinstall OS X (http://support.apple.com/kb/PH10763)\n\n\nA: To reiterate the obvious, you cannot simply roll back to a previous version of the OS. Many parts of the system like iTunes and iPhoto keep backup copies of library files so you can revert back once you handle the OS erase / reinstall.\nOther data buckets like iCloud sync and email, calendars, contacts should be exportable or stored elsewhere. You may have to re-implement the settings you choose since they may be changed to a format that doesn't allow a simple copying back of preference files from a newer OS to an older OS.\n\nA: Since the question does not mention backups, I guess there aren't any.  What you can try in this case, is to make a time machine backup (e.g. on an external USB Harddrive) of the current Mavericks partition. \nThen do a clean install (as suggested by jaume) and then use the migration assistant getting your data back from the Maverick backup into Mountain Lion.\n\nA: I had the same issue as you. I was stuck in Mavericks and any time I'd try to boot and select a Mountain Lion installer, it wouldn't work.\nThis is what I did:\n\n\n*\n\n*Booted holding cmd + r, which then showed the recovery options\n\n*Open Disk Utility\n\n*Erase the hard drive\n\n*Shut Down\n\n*Boot computer\n\n*It should show a rotating globe and a progress bar\n\n*After that is complete, you should be able to install Mountain Lion!\n\n", "Q: How can I get Nike+ to play songs from Spotify? Recently I've started using the Nike+ app on my iPhone to keep track of the distances and times when I go for a run in the park. I noticed that it has a power songs feature, which I haven't tried out as yet, I imagine it would allow me to specify particular songs that I can listen to while running. \nWhen I try to use the power songs feature, it only lists the songs that I have in iTunes, I only have a small collection of itunes songs that I would care to listen to whilst running and would prefer to find a way of using the songs that I have on Spotify instead.\nI have an unlimited Spotify account so I can store my playlists offline. I am not registered with Nike+.\n\nA: I'm afraid there isn't a solution currently available for this.  I've been using Nike+ alongside Spotify for over a year now by starting my Spotify playlist then starting a run in Nike+ and selecting \"no music\". I used to use iTunes playlists which worked with the power song feature and while that was kinda cool it's really not something I miss.\nYou might email them through their support page (couldn't find a feedback form) and mention it as a feature for future revisions.\nhttp://nikeplus.nike.com/plus/support/#contact\n\nA: I use Nike+ and Spotify.

I would like to put streaming video on the television (Like the Stanley Cup Playoff) which is via my web browser, I would also like to be able to surf the net on the monitor while the game is streaming on the tube.\nI am totally new to Mac, I have never even had an iPod so I am unsure what limitations may or may not exist.\nAny assistance would be wonderful\nRob\nEDIT: I do own an Apple TV. If I got a Mac Mini would it replace the Apple TV? I want to be able to surf netflix and my iTunes on the television but I would also like to be able to work on the computer on the monitor at the same time, I don't know if this will do that though.\n\nA: The Mac mini has an HDMI port and a thunderbolt port. You can hook your TV up via the HDMI port and your monitor via the thunderbolt port, although if you are planning on using a non-apple monitor you will most likely need an adapter. Essentially you'll have a dual monitor computer. Move a browser window with the game on to the TV.

If you're using MySQL, you can use MySQLWorkbench. Commercially, there is the Navicat line of products. I haven't used them though. They are available on the Mac app store. \nLooking just now, I see Wikipedia has a page on data modeling tools.\n", "Q: How to copy all messages of a conversation in one folder? For archiving purposes, I would like to copy/move all messages of a conversation in one folder, including sent messages and messages stored in different folders. I tried several things, like \"Cmd+A\" while one message of a conversation is selected, but nothing seems to work. Is there a way to do that?\nThe idea is the following: I use an IMAP account an whenever a project is finished, I move the corresponding folder on the server to an archive, e.g., from ./Mail to ./MailArchive. At the moment, all mails are included except the mails I sent. To get a complete archive, the sent mails should be in there as well.\n\nA: The answer above about selecting all the messages in a conversation is good, but it forgets that you specified that the messages are not all in the same folder. What you need to do is create a smart folder first to get all the messages into a \"virtual\" folder, then select them. The smart folder could use a condition such as a specific word or string in the subjects of the emails, or you could simply grab all your emails (Sender contains @, for example), then use the Command-Shift-K shortcut to select the conversation, if they all come up as a single conversation.\n\nA: This is doable, but needs to include all the folders where emails are part of the conversation thread. \nTo start you must be able to see your list of email folders, then select the inbox, then hold the command key, and select the rest of the folders that need to be part of the thread. You now have a mess of emails from a bunch of folders visible. \nSelect one of the messages in the thread. Mail should now highlight the rest of the messages in the thread. You can add another thread by command clicking another email.\nNow do cmd-shift-k to select all the messages in the thread(s). It's under the View menu, Select, All messages in this conversation. \nYou can now move them all, the easiest is to right-click, or Ctrl-click, and select the option to move them, and the destination folder. You can also use the Move to or Copy to options in the Message menu.\n", "Q: changing the meta key in emacs I am running emacs 24.3 through the terminal on OS X 10.8.4. I would like to modify the meta-key which is currently set to be the ESC key. I have successfully changed the meta-key from ESC to option/alt however I am interested in remapping the meta-key to be the left-shift key. As I never use the left-shift key, I wouldn't mind remapping it permanently for all applications on my machine.\n\n\n*\n\n*How can I change the meta-key in emacs running from the terminal to any other key?\n\n*Specifically, I would like to change the meta-key to left-shift as this would be really close to where my fingers are usually placed.\n\n*Can this be configured through emacs via emacs-lisp? Or, must this be configured through OS X settings such as how I changed the caps-lock key?\n\n\nAll help is greatly appreciated!\nEDIT: How can I do this both on my mac and when I connect remotely?\n\nA: Meta key problems with emacs seem to be very common, especially on OSX where alt/option is used to input special characters by default.\nIf you are using AquamacsEmacs[Aquamacs Homepage] or CarbonEmacsPackage, you may be able to set the modifier keys within your .emacs or other preferences file.\nSpecifically to map shift to meta, I'd try this (Note: this is untested):\n(setq mac-shift-modifier 'meta)\n\nIf that doesn't work, there may not be an easy way to remap shift in this fashion.  You may need to look into the define-key function in emacs lisp.\nOtherwise, if you're using emacs via the terminal, from homebrew, or some port of xemacs with XQuartz, you might want to look into using xmodmap\n\nA: What about using a macro/hotkey program like Keyboard Maestro?

I like to keep the iTunes Mini Player in the bottom left corner of my screen, since it doesn't overlap anything else there and I can always see it. This works fine, with the following exception:\nWhen I change iTunes to the standard iTunes window again to select a different playlist or  browse my selection, and then switch it back to the Mini Player, it's still in the bottom left corner, but is now positioned a bit too high, basically above the dock, instead of to the left of the dock. Which means I have to move it down again.\nIt seems like Windows have a natural tendency to avoid positions next to the dock, with the bottom of the window at the very bottom of the screen.\nIs there a way to work around this, to force the window to stay at the bottom of the screen?\n\nA: The dock will automatically push windows up above it to avoid the problem of losing windows. This is something that cannot be changed I believe. The only way to get it down that far would be to hide the dock or place the dock on the left/right side.\n", "Q: How do I send ASCII text to printer (over USB)?

I can't see any virtual device under /dev/ that seems to correspond to the printer.\nThe output from System Information looks like this:\nGeneric Bulk Device:\n\n  Product ID:   0x5011\n  Vendor ID:    0x0416  (Winbond Electronics Corp.)\n  Version:   3.00\n  Serial Number:    1234567890\n  Speed:    Up to 12 Mb/sec\n  Manufacturer: Generic\n  Location ID:  0x14100000 / 1\n  Current Available (mA):   500\n  Current Required (mA):    100\n  1284 Device ID:   print00\n\nIs there a way to send text (ASCII) to the printer?\nWhen Mac OS X tries to identify the printer it manages to send PostScript code that the printer outputs verbatim so at least some parts of the communication with printer works. If I just could avoid sending PostScript code and instead just send ordinary text.\n\n\nA: I managed to install a raw printer driver and print to it from the command line.\nUsing CUPS/Gutenprint's web interface at http://localhost:631/ I added a printer with device URI \n\nusbtb://Generic%00%00%06/Generic%20Bulk%20Device?serial=1234567890\n\nand selected \"Raw\" as the make for the printer.

This type of printer accepts raw text and prints it. They typically support 255 characters and must be configured to on of a few supported character sets, such as ASCII or CP437.\nThese printers accept \"raw\" input - meaning characters, spaces, line breaks, etc. They sometimes support images also.\nBasically you'll need to\n\n*\n\n*Add a raw printer through CUPS (common unix printing interface)\n\n*Send raw text, PDF, or PS to the printer\n\nSteps\n1) Turn on CUPS web administration\n\n*\n\n*Open a Terminal\n\n*Enter the command $ sudo cupsctl WebInterface=yes\nThat will enable a feature that lets you add and remove printers from the CUPS localhost web administration site.\n2) Find printer address\nIf it's a local printer:\n\n*\n\n*Run the command $ lpinfo -v | grep usb\nYou'll get a response that looks like:\ndirect usb:///80Series%20Receipt%20Printer%20200DPI?location=14200000\n\nThe usb:///<printer name>?location=<locationID> is your printer address on the USB hub. Copy that text.\nIf it's a network printer\nYou'll want the IP address and port of that printer.  The full address will be:\nsocket://<ip address>:<port>\n\nFor example:\nsocket://192.168.1.12:9100\n\n3) Add printer\n\n*\n\n*Go to your CUPS Administration Page (http://localhost:631)\n\n\n*Click Administration\n\n\n*Click Add printer\n\n\n*Click AppSocket/HP JetDirect (Don't click your existing printer if it shows up), click Continue\n\n\n*Paste your printer address from Step 2 in the Connection input, click Continue\n\n\n*Give the printer a name and description, click Continue\n\n\n*Select Raw in the Make selection and click Continue. If you are super lucky you might see your manufacturer here. Good luck.\n\n\n*Select Raw Queue (en) in the Model selection and click Add Printer\n\n\n*Select printer options. For Raw Queue (en), you'll see a Starting Banner and Ending Banner.  You'll probably want to select None for both of those.\n4) Connect new printer to MacOS System Preferences\n\n*\n\n*Click Administration\n\n*Click Add class\n\n*Fill out the form. The Name field will be the human-readable name you want to appear in the Printers and Scanners section of System Preferences.\n\n*Select the printer you just added from Members and click Add class\n\n*Your printer should now appear in your Printers and Scanners\n\n*(optional) - turn off CUPS web administration by issuing the command $ sudo sudo cupsctl WebInterface=no in your Terminal\n5) Find your printer\n\n*\n\n*In your Terminal, issue the command $ lpstat -p.

Corporate policy at my job requires a lockscreen passcode on iDevices with corporate email on them, even personal. Yesterday, I set my password, then 5 minutes later had to use it. When I entered it, the phone says it was wrong. I entered it the magic number of wrong times, and so began the Great Purge of 2013 (data wiped from device). I stopped this from finishing (power + home button until it shut down).\nI'm willing to let this process complete, as long as I'll still be at 6.1.2 when it finishes. Does anyone know how long the process takes with a 16GB iPhone 5 (A1428)? I've read the Apple article about it, which tells me that it supports hardware encryption, and the process should only take minutes, but I let it go for about 2 hours, and nothing. I wonder if, by \"minutes\" Apple means like 600 minutes or something. \nDoes jailbreaking affect the amount of time the wipe takes? Any input would be helpful. I'm just really trying to avoid 6.1.4.\n\nA: So I verified that deleting the hardware encryption key should not take very long at all. My problem was that the phone was jailbroken on 6.1.2 (not sure what the EXACT problem was). By following this procedure, I was able to delete all content and settings manually, with the file browsers iFunbox and iTools. Unfortunately, it didn't delete the errant configuration profile that locked me out of my phone, so I still had to update to 6.1.4.\nI wish I had the time to investigate the issue further, but as this is my primary phone, I just needed it back operational. \n", "Q: How to make Numbers accept the \".\" instead of the comma \",\" when inserting data? I'm from elgium. In Dutch, as probably in some other languages, you write numbers like this: 3,141592, where in English it'd be 3.141592, but the Numbers app only interprets my input as a number when I use a comma, which messes things up when I export it as a csv. How do I make it accept the . instead of the ,? My system language is already set to English.\n\nA: Numbers seems to use the decimal separator selected in System Preferences:\n\nI didn't find any way to use both comma and period as decimal separators though.\nNote that if you change the region from the menu at the top, it also affects things like the default values of locale variables in Terminal and iTerm.\n", "Q: cal command - start monday I was wondering - is there a way to make 'cal' (a terminal program) start the week on monday? \nUsually it can be done with the -m flag, but this does not have any effect on the Mac.

The full document is 950 KB.\nI want to extract the figures and tables at the end of document into a separate file, so I open the document in Preview and drag the pages I need onto the desktop. This creates a new file, foo (dragged).pdf which is 2.2 MB.\nHow can the last 10 pages of a 35-page document be 2.4 times larger than the original document? Is OSX adding lots of metadata to these pages? I consider this a curiosity more than a problem, but still... \n\nA: The Mac OS does not optimize PDF files the way Acrobat or other PDF generating applications usually do. It may also be that when you drag the page to the desktop is is making a PDF that is really just a wrapper for an bitmap image.\nYou could try using \"Export As...\" by right-clicking a thumbnail of a page and see if that results in smaller files. Another choice would be to delete all of the pages you do not want to keep and then save the file.\nHere is a decent thread about optimizing PDF file sizes in Mac OS. https://discussions.apple.com/thread/3213814?start=0&tstart=0\n\nA: PDF files are text files with some binary fields in them, so you should be able to just open the two files in a text editor (or use more / vi / grep ) to inspect each. A file comparison tool might also help you discern whether Preview is re-encoding the assets in a sub-optimal manner.\nAutomator also has some PDF processing tools including compression, compression of images and rendering the pages as images. I would try exporting the resulting PDF from Preview and select the Quartz filter of \"reduce file size\" to see if perhaps that would reduce the size.\nYou can see several related questions where others have noticed this effect where the standard settings increase the size of some types of content.\n\n\n*\n\n*Why does combining a PDF cause its size to be significantly larger?\nAs a postscript, a 35 page paper in ascii format weighing in at 950K is pretty efficient but also still an order of magnitude larger than some basic texts that are in the 60 page range even with illustrations on each page.\nTake for example this book from Project Gutenberg - The Cat and the Mouse by Hartwell James and John R. Neill\n\n\n*\n\n*The plain text (UTF-8) and HTML versions are in the 70 kB range\n\n*The ePub version is a sleek 45 kB with no images, but swells to 2.8 MB with images.\n\n\nIf I take the HTML version and inspect it in Safari, it's clear the 75 kB is just the main text/HTML file and not all the included images. Printing that page to PDF using Safari (which uses the same rendering engine as Preview) - I get a 3.7 MB file that can be compressed with Quartz reduce file size filter to 2.2 MB.\nHopefully these examples help you in deciding whether to generate all versions of your files in LaTeX or live with the libraries for PDF generation on OS X.\n", "Q: Keyboard stays lit during sleep When I put my computer to sleep the keyboard stays lit.

And same goes to the graphics?\nI'm getting a sense that Apple's trying to lower their performance on CPUs, thus extended battery life, then ultimately increase the lowered performance by putting a faster SSD; and Apple did that because they really have nothing to show around to the developers and the public in WWDC anyway so they launched a new macbook air which the only thing it does is stays on for 12 hours.\nAm I correct? Please correct me if I'm wrong.

I know there's a keyboard shortcut to cycle between windows, but It would be nice to have them more clearly displayed in Mission Control. There's the five finger open hand swipe gesture that can be used to spread out the windows a bit, however, I find that it doesn't separate the windows sufficiently, and the gesture is temperamental in itself.\nAre there any modifications, work arounds, selection commands or anything that could make window selection easier?\nExamples of grouping:\nThis is mission control with separately grouped windows.

The last thing I want is to pay for all the apps again... \n\nA: I moved from Germany to the Netherlands four years ago. I have only a single account. Once I got a Dutch credit card, I was enforced by Apple to switch countries for my account. This had the following effects on my account:\n\n\n*\n\n*I was no longer able to update my iOS apps in iTunes on a Mac. It told me that there are updates, but when I wanted to perform them, it refused to do so. \n\n*I was always (and am still) able to update my apps in the AppStore on my iPad (which I had already in Germany).\n\n*I am no longer able to buy stuff on the German AppStore on my iPad.\n\n*I can buy stuff on the Dutch AppStore on my iPad.\n\n*\"Dutch apps\" and \"German apps\" are indistinguishable on my iPad.\n\n\nI later bought an iPhone in the Netherlands, which was never associated with my account while it was still a German account. Same picture as with the iPad: I can buy only in the Dutch AppStore, but can run my old apps and the new ones. Old apps update from the Dutch AppStore, even if I bought them in the German one.\nBoth the iPad and the iPhone got updated versions of iOS and the situation stayed the same. \nYou should check if the apps you are running are available in your destination. If so, it worked for me. \n\nA: I had a similar problem once. I've got a couple of apps bought in the US app store using a gift card, and my primary store was in ireland. I simply used a different account to buy using the gift card. The only thing I had to do is to login to another account and that's it.\nThen I moved to another country, and like guwac said, I had to change the credit card.\nNow I have apps from 3 different stores using 2 different accounts.

Everything was working great till this morning, where when I woke up I noticed that the device had no WiFi. Sometimes sbSettings crash so I rebooted the phone. From that time on, the phone restarts every 2 minutes , has no signal \"no service\" , the Wi-Fi and Bluetoooth in the settings are -greyed out- that means I cant select them.\nI cant even close the device, as when I do it automatically restarts! The only way I found to finally close it was to plug in to my pc, put it in airplane mode and then shut it down. Like this it remains closed.\nI used iPhone Enterprise Configuration app to get the logs from the phone the 2 minutes that it stays open , before it restarts again.\nThe console logs .\nI read some dozens of forums with people with the same problem and i tries solutions, like putting the phone on aeroplane mode, restart and then back to normal, i also tried opening data-3g, take off the sim and then restart the phone and put the sim back again, but nothing seems to work.\nHas anyone ever encountered something like this before? My problem can actually be exactly described here .\n\nA: It seems like your iOS software might be corrupted. I would suggest you to backup your iPhone through iTunes (no worries, iTunes doesn't detect whether your device is jailbroken) and restore your device to factory settings, restore from your backup and jailbreak again. If everything goes smoothly, try to be careful when adding sources or downloading apps and tweaks, because if you add untrusted sources, viruses might be downloaded and since file viewing is possible on a jailbroken device by users, viruses can too.\nIf you're afraid to lose your jailbreak settings and any configurations you have made or you have bought paid apps, I recommend you to backup all of your apps and tweaks by downloading OpenBackup via Cydia. I doubt you'll be able to do all that because the process of downloading and installing the app, and backing up the contents take more than 2 minutes. I was using iOS 5 when I was tempted to upgrade to iOS 6 and my iPhone was \"bricked\", so I had to give up my jailbreak and restored my iPhone (same as yours that time, iPhone 3GS). Few months later I bought an iPhone 4S and tried to jailbreak it and I was happy to realize that my jailbreak settings were still there! So I hope when you restore your iPhone and jailbreak again it will have all your jailbreak settings.\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: Phone number format How can i stop Contacts from autoformatting phone numbers? It doesn't seem to matter which region I specify in settings it always registers phone numbers in a strange format: the first two numbers together then a space.  Why can't I just manually format ?\n\nA: I think this is a great question. I believe it used to be possible. The only way I know of now, is to use a custom field (like \"Department\"), change the label, and use it as if it were a phone number. It's hokey but it works.\n\nA: \"Why can't I just manually format?\"  You are not alone.  See this thread: apple discussion\nAfter some googling and experimentation, I have found what I believe are the intended methods of entering phone numbers are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Type the number without a country code and OS X (and iOS) will format it with your computer's region/country settings.\n\n*Type the number with a country code (and a space) in front and the computer will format it based on the standard formatting for that country.\n\n\nSome examples (I live in Australia):\n0345678910 -> 03 4567 8910 (AU landline format)\n0456789012 -> 0456 789 012 (AU mobile format)\n+61 0345678910 -> +61 (0)3 4567 8910  (+61 is AU country code)\n+61 345678910 -> +61 3 3567 8910  (I think this is more correct than previous line)\n+1 2345678901 -> +1 (234) 567-8901   (USA)\n+33 123456789 -> +33 1 23 45 67 89  (France)\nNo doubt, it isn't prefect.

In an update for MS Office for Mac, the installer asks to close Chrome and Safari — why?\n\nWhat do those programs have to do with Microsoft Office?\n\nI only have Word, Excel, and PowerPoint.\n\nA: Presumably, the Office installer can modify/update the Microsoft Silverlight.plugin (which is installed in /Library/Internet Plug-Ins/), which Safari and Chrome could potentially be using.\nIt's primarily just a precaution against updating files which an application is actively using.\n[EDIT]\nAfter further investigation, it looks like it's actually the fact that the installer modifies the fonts in /Library/Fonts/Microsoft/ which is the motivation behind requiring that several apps not be running.

To the touch it's hot in the top-left above the keyboard (where everything plugs in) and iStat gives the CPU temperature as between 50-70 degrees C (CPU Die, CPU proximity usually 2-3 degrees less).\nI see from various searches this seems pretty normal for MBP and shouldn't in itself damage anything.\nMy question though is about the fans - they're always just plugging along around 2000 rpm.\nIf, using iStat, I set them to use a profile with say minimum 4-5000 rpm then, naturally, everything cools right down. With the default profile I get the temperatures above.\nSo, is this right? Presumably when I say 'default' it's using Apple's determination for fan speeds. But is it normal for it to get to 70-degrees or thereabouts without the fans automatically speeding up?\nAnd as a supplementary question assuming it is working correctly in not speeding up for those temperatures; is it a good idea to perhaps use iStat to have the fans speed up when charging/plugged in (when it gets the heaviest use via Thunderbolt connectors)? Other than battery life being less my guess would be running everything cooler would give a longer life to components?\nMany thanks in advance for reading my long and meandering question!\n\nA: You should check the fans(s) in a MBP on a somewhat regular basis. There is a grid in the exit that channels the air coming out of the fan which tends to plug with lint. Remove the bottom cover of the machine and remove the fan(s). You will probably find a wad of lint obstructing the grid.\n\nA: I don't think there's any reason for the fans to go above what Apple recommends at that temperature. My CPU has been at 85-90% idle for a while now and the CPU temp is 145-155˚F (62-68℃), with the fans at just a little under 4000 rpm. That's completely normal. My laptop has been this way for three years and never had any issue, and same for the laptop I had for four years before that. If you're at that temp, I see no reason why the fans would need to be above 2000 rpm. 68-70℃ for a CPU is not really hot.\nIn my (admittedly not expert) opinion, what you're experiencing is perfectly normal and harmless.\n\nA: What you are experiencing is quite normal for MBP. It may vary quite a lot with an ambient temperature above 28 degrees C.\nThe only inconvenience with the high speed of the fan is the noise. Rather than that, you can keep it faster and the MBP will be cooler. Obviously also the fan life will be slightely reduced but they are so performing that most probably you will not see the end of the fan life.\nAnother trick is to make sure the MBP is placed on a surface that can dissipate temperature. A wooden table or a glass table as well as your legs are not the best heat dissipators.\n\nA: I have an old style 15\" 2.6Ghz Macbook pro and I did not like the way Apple doesn't run the fans until the laptop gets above 75 degrees celcius.Then the fan speed goes up and down over and over again. \nSo I use SMCFancontrol to keep the fans at 1600rpm this keeps the laptop at 60 degrees celcius to 70 degrees celcius. It still allows the fans to speed up but it's higher than the base speed Apple has set up to 3000 rpm and the fans are almost slient.  \n", "Q: iMessage vs SMS on command I've got a really dumb question. I just got my new (to me) iPhone 4 on a plan and activated through a service provider. Yay! My iPhone was restored to a backup of my iPod so all the data and stuff transferred, and in trying to text my mom (who is on an iPhone 5), all my texts come through iMessage unless I explicitly turn it off.\nHowever my mom appears to be able to change messaging me between the two services on command. They all appear in the same conversation for me, but since all my messages are sent as iMessage, she has to switch to a different conversation (the iMessage one) to see my replies to an SMS.\nAny idea why or how I might be able to prevent that?\n\nA: I would check your address book entry on your mothers iPhone. iMessages can be registered to phone numbers, or email addresses. My guess is that because you're sending iMessages they are arriving under your email address on your mothers iPhone. Then, when she sends SMSs to you they go out under your phone number. So, check her iPhone's address book. Ensure that your entry has both your email address and phone number under the same entry.\n", "Q: SSH works locally but not remotely I have remote login turned on, and when I'm at home, I can access the Mac via SSH just fine, by using the local IP address.

Or am I missing something really obvious here?\n\nA: If all your machines are running Lion or Mountain Lion, and you're using the same iCloud account on them, then you can use iCloud to ssh as described in this blog post from One Thing Well\nFirst, find your Back To My Mac account number by running.\ndns-sd -E\n\nThen SSH to another machine like so\nssh -2 -6 username@computer-name.[account number].members.btmm.icloud.com\n\nYou can also add this to your ~/.ssh/config to make it easier\nHost mac-remote\nUser username\nHostName computername.[account number].members.btmm.icloud.com\nAddressFamily inet6\nProtocol 2\n\n\nA: Here's what I have setup in the past, which does allow me to access my Mac via ssh:\nOn my AT&T gateway, I setup the firewall settings to push all internet traffic directly to my Airport Extreme. While the Airport Extreme is by no means an enterprise class firewall, it actually works really well for home/small office security needs. I then use the Airport Extreme to send all traffic on port 22 to the internal IP address of my Mac mini. I have my DHCP settings on the Airport Extreme setup with a static map, which always gives the same IP address to my Mac mini. I then use Terminal, and type in the following:\nssh UserName@MyPublicIPAddress\n\nAfter this, I'm asked for the password of my user name. Once I put in the password, Terminal then gives me a prompt for the user account that I logged in as through ssh.\nKeep in mind that by sending all ssh traffic directly to your home system you are opening up a big security hole. Even with a strong password, you're still at serious risk. I've only done this on a few occasions, and for very specific reasons. When I used to run OS X Server at home, I had ssh forwarded directly to my server. The server's logs showed that I was constantly under attack. People trolling the internet had found my server, and they were constantly trying to break in. After I noticed that, I setup VPN so as to have one more barrier between my server and the outside.\n", "Q: how do i restore my wiped erased imac OS X My iMac was stolen,using the find my iphone app I erased, wiped it. 2 days later I got it back.

I installed some temp. monitor which showed the GPU was reaching nearly 70 degree celcius. This seems like a lot. \nI was viewing flash using chrome. I normally use linux and I know there are different versions of flash there, some better than other. Are there any wellknown problems with chrome and the stock flash plugin? Should I be using Safari? Should I install some other flash plugin? Or should I just totally avoid using flash on my Apple devices?\nThanks.\n\nA: Flash has many problems, including making your computer run hot.  I have an older dual quad core i7 iMac, and Flash does that to my computer too.  It's also a large security hole.\nI'd recommend removing flash completely, and when you need to run it, do so using Google Chrome.  Chrome has a sandboxed, often updated version of Flash. It won't solve the issue with it taxing your system, but it is a bit more secure.  \nTo answer your questions at the end:\n1 - Chrome works fine - Flash is the problem.\n2 - For Flash, I'd say use Chrome only, and leave Safari out of this.\n3 - Chrome provided Flash is probably your best bet\n4 - I avoid Flash as much as possible, but I do love me some Google Street View.  Gotta use Flash for it.\nGood luck.\n", "Q: Very high MacBook Battery consumption on Sleep I got an alleged trouble on my late 2008 Unibody MacBook.\nI've never worried about this trouble because I thought that was a normal thing but I'm start thinking that it could be a trouble trouble.\nMy MacBook, on stop status, consumes around 30/35% of battery a day, is it normal??\nI changed battery around 2 years ago and now it has 250 cycles and health is 93%.\nSince I remember it has got this trouble and a format doesn't change things.\nIs it normal or could it be a trouble?\n\nA: Your option to get free support that is best would be to take it to the Genius Bar where they have some fairly fancy battery diagnostics. Any Apple Authorized Service center has access to similar tools from Apple.\nAs a consumer, you could check the System Information (System Profiler on older OS) and review Power details under Hardware:\n  Charge Information:\n    Charge Remaining (mAh): 6638\n    Fully Charged:  Yes\n    Charging:   No\n    Full Charge Capacity (mAh): 6693\n  Health Information:\n    Cycle Count:    54\n    Condition:  Normal\n\nThe above details are from a new MacBook Pro with an internal battery. It's in great shape. The below details are from a 14 month old MacBook Air where the battery is not going to make it to it's design life. I'll have to pay for the replacement since at the 1 year point when the warranty was in force, it was still \"within spec\"\n  Charge Information:\n    Charge Remaining (mAh): 1957\n    Fully Charged:  No\n    Charging:   No\n    Full Charge Capacity (mAh): 4357\n  Health Information:\n    Cycle Count:    119\n    Condition:  Normal\n\nYou might be able to tell if it's just a battery by inspecting your condition, cycle count and FCC - but these data are much more valuable when you have it logged every month of the Mac's life or can compare your values to thousands of other data points (which is presumably part of what Apple does in its diagnostics).\n", "Q: Is Mac Mini's Fusion drive useful if I mostly use windows 8 through Bootcamp? I am considering of buying a Mac Mini with a 1TB Fusion Drive. However I will rarely use OSX (except for iPhone application development) and will mostly be running Windows 8 through Bootcamp. In this setup, is it worth for me to spend extra 250$ on the Fusion Drive?\n\nA: My understanding is if you want to use Bootcamp, you'll have each drive formatted and available to the software as a two-drive system and not as a one drive - fused hybrid item.\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot Camp 5: Frequently asked questions - http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5639\nOut of the box, the BootCamp software will see if you have a CoreStorage fusion drive and just put the Windows partition on the spinning HD. There, it won't even get to see the SSD nor likely any of the data that exists on a core storage volume (which is a mix of files stored on the SSD and on the HDD).\nI'd still get the fusion drive since you can always experiment with the BootCamp default situation, experiment with virtualization, and decide to partition both drives to be stand-alone and run BootCamp to install Windows on the SSD itself. Worst case, you don't like the experience and take advantage of Apple's 14 day return policy to get a different Mac if you don't like your Mini once you've tried it for a week or so.\n\nHere's what you'll likely see when you get your Mac. The SSD will be disk0 and the DHH will be disk1 and the combination of disk0s2 and disk1s2 will be the raw space that fuses into Macintosh HD to be a logical:\nMacMini:~ me$ diskutil list\n/dev/disk0\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *121.0 GB   disk0\n   1:                        EFI                         209.7 MB   disk0s1\n   2:          Apple_CoreStorage                         121.0 GB   disk0s2\n   3:                 Apple_Boot Boot OS X               134.2 MB   disk0s3\n\n/dev/disk1\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *1.0 TB     disk1\n   1:                        EFI                         209.7 MB   disk1s1\n   2:          Apple_CoreStorage                         999.4 GB   disk1s2\n   3:                 Apple_Boot Boot OS X               134.2 MB   disk1s3\n\nIn system profiler under storage, you'll see something similar to this:\nMacintosh HD:\n\n  Available:    1 TB (1,000,499,220,480 bytes)\n  Capacity: 1.11 TB (1,111,826,497,536 bytes)\n  Mount Point:  /\n  File System:  Journaled HFS+\n  Writable: Yes\n  Ignore Ownership: No\n  BSD Name: disk2\n  Volume UUID:  32F084C9-A737-34BE-9567-165721D02C07\n  Logical Volume:\n  Revertible:   No\n  Encrypted:    No\n  LV UUID:  CDBF5035-78F6-4302-B90E-2B9034324A26\n  Logical Volume Group:\n  Name: Macintosh HD\n  Size: 1.12 TB (1,120,333,979,648 bytes)\n  Free Space:   115 KB (114,688 bytes)\n  LVG UUID: D0EFA715-18BE-408E-8149-838206F04AFB\n  Physical Volumes:\ndisk0s2:\n  Media Name:   APPLE SSD SM128E Media\n  Size: 120.99 GB (120,988,852,224 bytes)\n  Medium Type:  SSD\n  Protocol: SATA\n  Internal: Yes\n  Partition Map Type:   GPT (GUID Partition Table)\n  Status:   Online\n  S.M.A.R.T.

My Macbook with Mountain Lion 10.8.4 doesn't sees it, nor does my wife's Macbook. Strangely, my iPad and iPhone can detect it and the network traffic goes through it, and everything works smoothly. However, the Airport Utility (version 5.6) on my Macbook does not see it.\nAdditionally, I can play music from my iPad or send the YouTube voice channel to the Airport Express, so the device works, but my Macbook still doesn't see it.\nI have a MacBook (13-inch Aluminum, Late 2008) but I don't think that matters. I think that the OS version will matter here, because two weeks before it worked well.\n\nA: The Airpoat Express seems to respond best if its settings are completely cleared first.\nTo do this, on both the older and newer model, you have to insert something in the one of the two tiny dots which is a hole, and press down in there WITH the unit unpowered, continuing to press while sliding the AE into its little base and for a few moments after. \nThis is most easily accomplished by having the AE in the base ready to move into place - then perform the pressing and connecting. I don't need to add, this is a total PITA, but it gives you an AE looking for settings--which you promptly input into AU. \nThere is a supposed Reset done by pressing while in place and powered, but it tends to accomplish nothing.\n", "Q: Apps disappeared after unlocking, backup and restore of my iPhone I unlocked my iPhone yesterday and backed up and restored my data using iTunes, however my apps did not come back onto my phone when I restored from backup.\nHow do I find them on my computer in my backup, and restore them to my iPhone?\n\nA: Probably you didn't transfer your purchased apps to iTunes before you restored the phone. Under normal circumstances you would have gotten a warning message about this. Look under Applications in iTunes, check the iPhone tab and see if your apps are listed there, if not they are not backed up. If you have connected your iTunes software with your iPhone Apple account the apps should sync automatically.\nOnly way to get them back otherwise is to go to Appstore and download them again. Easiest way is to enter Appstore, go to the Update tab and press Purchases/Not on iPhone. (Using the same Apple-account you won't have to pay for your purchased apps again.)\n\nA: I thought I had this problem but in fact I just needed to let iTunes sync the iPhone after the backup had initially restored and I'd registered the new handset on the phone network. The phone appeared fine and I had many apps - but not all. After letting it sync they all returned :)\n\nA: Actually, the apps are not automatically uploaded to the phone after a recovery.\niTunes normally stores the apps on your computer,except if you manually moved or removed them.\nso what you can do after a restore is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open iTunes\n\n*Connect your phone\n\n*Go to \"Your Phone> Apps\"\n\n*Click on the \"install/uninstall/suppress\" button of one of the app (this will make the \"Apply\" button appear in the lower-right corner)\n\n*Click on the Apply button.\n\n*Wait, wait, wait... the more you have apps, the longer it is to process\n\n\n(The buttons name may vary as I translated their name from my iTunes install which is in french).\nWhile the apps are being uploaded, you should see their greyed icons with a progress bar on the phone.\n", "Q: Why do settings disappear? Mail, usuallly Long-time Mac user, curious why, from time to time, Mail settings just plain disappear. \nI only discover this when Mail suddenly can't connect. Have to input passwords again. \nAnd not the same password or place (several email accounts.) Could be the server p/w missing, or the POP3. One of life's little mysteries, has persisted since at least Lion.\nThe keychain entries are fine, the keychain and in fact whole system well-maintained. So where do they go? What erases them and why? \n\nA: Here is the explanation from my provider's tech support:\n\nWe think you should turn off [automatically manage connection\n  settings]; there should never be any reason for it to use different\n  ones. You always want it to stick with the recommended port 587\n  (etc.), no matter what.\nThe trouble with that feature is that if your ISP connection stops\n  working for a second, and Apple Mail can't connect, it will think \"oh,\n  the settings might be wrong, so let's try a different port\". It tries\n  something else at random, and maybe it works, because your ISP\n  connection is working again. But Apple Mail wrongly assumes the port\n  setting was the trouble -- so it saves the new setting! And then\n  you're using something weird that only works on certain networks,\n  etc., when it would have been better to keep the original \"works\n  everywhere\" port number.\nApple Mail is the only program we know of that does anything like\n  this, and it's not a good idea, really; it's designed to help people\n  if their mail server company changes things, but can cause problems in\n  other cases. We've even seen cases where it randomly changes the\n  settings to something that can never possibly work on any servers,\n  although it's not supposed to.\n\nAs evidence for this explanation, when I turned it off and it revealed the port settings, they were different for each account (but all were wrong).\n", "Q: Windows 8 version specifically for Mac I really dont understand this. My school sells products to students via onthehub.com.\nThey offer a separate version of Windows 8 Pro that they claim is specifically for Macs. How does this make any sense? They say it is tailored to work with parallels or bootcamp and those type of things.\nI am assuming they are only making the claim for 'security' sake? Let me know your two cents. I really just want to use it on my PC.\n\nA: Perhaps they have selected an OEM version or otherwise made sure that the version being selected somehow addresses the need they perceive their Mac community would prefer.\nThe upgrade pricing seems odd since OS X isn't an eligible version for consumer upgrades, but perhaps the university has negotiated a special agreement and wants to only offer the upgrade price to Mac users and not PC users?\n\nA: I have used onthehub.com to purchase a Windows 8 license recently.  I saw the distinction between the regular and Mac versions while I was browsing the site.  I was actually going to buy one of each, a regular version of Windows 8 Pro for my PC and a Mac version for my Parallels VM on my Mac.  The site wouldn't let me buy both.  It appears that there is a licensing restriction that OnTheHub will only let you buy one or the other.  \nMaybe that ties into the reason for having a separate Mac version - you are then blocked from buying the traditional PC install.\n", "Q: Password protected partitions on mac os x I have two partitions first is primary with os x installed and second is empty, I want to password protect this second partition so when I double click it must ask for password and then tell me read write files.\nI searched on internet but mostly people saying create a disk image apple encryption and you have password protected folder but I simply wants a password protected partition which ask for password who ever assess it.\nPlease tell me is there any benefit of creating standard user account sudo command can bypass it.\n\nA: simply format the second partion as Mac OS journaled encrypted via Disk Utility\n\nA: The way to solve the problem on OS X actually is to create an encrypted disk image and put that on the second partition. This gives you all the benefits you'll get from an encrypted partition and works without additional software.\nAlternatively you may want to look at TrueCrypt which offers partition-level encryption (among others) and also works cross-plattform. It's a bit more difficult to configure/use but there are some good tutorials on the site.\n", "Q: .htaccess protected site cannot be accessed by iPad I have been working on a website on a test server test.domain.com for a few weeks now.

Access was granted again.\nHow come that I was not asked for entering the details again in Safari on the iPad? Where can I check how these details were stored if they had been?\n\nA: Consider clearing Safari's cache of cookies and site specific data. This should clear Safari's record of login information used for your test web site.\nClear Cookies and Data\n\n\n*\n\n*Tap Settings;\n\n*Tap Safari;\n\n*Tap Clear Cookies and Data.\n\n\nApple publish further steps for clearing other Safari information in iOS: Safari web settings.\n", "Q: Speed Up Podcasts on iPod Classic I'm looking for a way to listen to podcasts at 2x on my iPod classic.

With easily I mean it should support editing in batch and replacing the files automatically, ideally started with a script directly in iTunes.\n(I do know about audacity, but I want something a little more automated)\n\nA: There's no such way to do that, actually.

Although it says it will remove the game and all of the data when trying to delete it does not.\nIs there a way to permanently delete the data when I delete the game from the iPad and iPhone?\n\nA: If the game is saving game data via iCloud, the data might have not been deleted when you removed the app from your iOS device.\nGo to Settings > General > Usage\nThere will be a section called iCloud with a Manage Storage option. Tapping this will load all your data stored on iCloud.\nUnder the Documents & Data section, check to see if your game has data saved to iCloud. If it does, simply tap on it and tap on the edit button in the top right hand corner to bring up the Delete prompt.\n\nA: In iOS 8, just go to Game Center app > Games > swipe left on games you want to remove and tap the button.\n\nA: You can hide apps from that list by going to iTunes on your computer (you don't have to connect the iPad, just log in to your iTunes account):\n\n\n*\n\n*Click the iTunes Store button. \n\n*Then click on the \"purchased\" link either on the bottom under Features or on the top right under Quick Links (that's for iTunes 11, it's somewhere else on older versions but still easy to find). \n\n*Find the app you want to hide, hover your mouse over the icon and an \"x\" will appear in the upper left corner. \n\n*Click the \"x\" and the app will be hidden on purchased list on Apple servers. \n\n\nNow you can check your iPad.

A couple people in this MacRumors forum thread have experienced the same, as has the author of this blog post. No indications as to how to get rid of it however.\nI haven't seen any error when testing say, so it may be some combination of hardware that causes it, but if the sound output is as expected, I wouldn't worry too much about it, and it will probably be fixed eventually.\nIf you're using say in shell scripts and need the Terminal output cleaned up a bit, you could always pipe it through grep: say test | grep -v \"MTBEAudioUnitSoundOutput::PropagateProperty Error -10851\".\n\nA: I'm just piping stderr to /dev/null for now, i.e.:\nsay test 2>/dev/null\n\n\nA: The error number is a constant named kAudioUnitErr_InvalidPropertyValue\nIt also shows up when using the NSSpeechSynthesizer API with the new voices in Mountain Lion.\nNSString *string = @\"Hello World\";\nNSSpeechSynthesizer *synth = [[NSSpeechSynthesizer alloc] initWithVoice:nil];\n[synth startSpeakingString:string];\n\nreference: https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/AudioUnit/Reference/AUComponentServicesReference/Reference/reference.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40007291-CH7-SW1\n", "Q: iPhone 4s turns itself off It started today and happened twice, my iPhone turns itself off even battery has 15%-17% charge, I can't open it, empty battery sign appears when I plug it in to charge, it begins to charge from 15%-17%, I couldn't find the reason, it has the latest iOS update, what could it be?\n\nA: The clue is that it begins to charge at 15% or so.. you have some bad cells in the battery, so they are not considered for charging, but are part of the 100% the battery should have.\nTake it in to Apple and have them look at it!\n\nA: From what it sounds your battery is damaged, you should take your iPhone to a Apple Authorized Service center for further investigation.\nDid this behaviour occur when you were outside, in cold?

I'm going to delete my OSX partition, leaving only my Windows 7 partition, and install Truecrypt, but I get the message saying that the first 32 kB of my system drive needs to be free in order to use TrueCrypt.\nWith the Macbook Pro, it looks like there is a 200MB GPT partition at the beginning of the drive.  If I'm going to use Windows 7 exclusively on this MBP, can I delete that 200 MB partition, or will this cause me booting issues?\n\nA: The first partition on an Apple Disk Utility drive is a 200MB EFI System Partition. OS X 10.8 and older do not need it for booting, but it is used for staging firmware updates. If it's removed, firmware updates won't be possible. Depending on exactly what TrueCrypt wants, you could resize the EFI System Partition, as 200MB isn't really required, by changing the start sector and then reformatting the EFI System partition (as FAT32).\n", "Q: Send 1 bookmark from IOS to Mac w/o iCloud or Email I do NOT want to sync all my bookmarks across all my devices via iCloud, etc. Far too many bookmarks on my Mac that don't need to be on iPad, etc.\nBut sometimes I find a site on my IOS device & I want to have that site bookmarked in my Mac automatically or at least send the site link to my Mac to put it into my Mac bookmarks folder later.  I can't find any way to do this. Any ideas?\n\nA: You can paste it into a note or calendar event if you sync those via iCloud.  Or you could send it to yourself via iMessage.\n\nA: iCloud Tabs does exactly this, but there doesn't seem to be a way to enable only that feature without also enabling bookmark syncing. But it's well worth it: any tabs that are open on one device are automatically listed on all others, without you having to do a single thing.\nOn your iOS device, \"iCloud Tabs\" gets its own top-level folder in your bookmarks, so you can effectively ignore the bookmarks that are synced from your Mac.\n", "Q: Camera roll trying to send email from inactive account I have an iPhone which had an exchange account as the default for mail.

And when I turn it back on battery drains by about 3 or 4 percent. Could this be a battery problem or a sign to another major problem? So the only way I use my phone nowadays is while its plugged in. Battery also drains like hell. While using 3G battery goes from 100 to 50 in an hour. Are the random shut downs related to the excessive battery drain? Just last month I changed my battery IC beacause it displayed the \" charging is not supported with this accesory\" warning. \n\nA: It sounds like you need to backup your iPhone with iTunes and change your battery... but I'm a little confused by your post. You have tried to put a new battery in it already? If so your issue is probably related to other internal components of your phone and not the battery. The 3GS is quite old now. It may be time for an upgrade.\n\nA: The battery draining down a few percents is normal behavior, but going from 100 to 50 in an hour is not (unless you are running some crazy large processes). The 3GS is an old phone, so that wouldn't surprise me that the battery life is a bit sketchy. My advice would be to have the battery replaced. I'm unsure of if your data will be lost during the process, I don't think it will, but back it up on iTunes first just to be safe. \nSecond, no the random shutdowns are probably not related to your battery issue. If the phone randomly goes black and fades away, that's a battery issue. If the phone goes through a proper shutdown, then it is not. My advice would be to do a total restore, and if that doesn't work, it's a hardware issue.\n\nA: I had the same problem. Your battery is dead, plain and simple. So you basically have tree choices: \n\n\n*\n\n*buy a new iPhone;\n\n*replace your battery, but that might damage your phone if not done properly and may end up costing more than you'd want;\n\n*buy an external battery and let your 3GS be permanently plugged into that battery. They make pretty nice shell cases with embedded batteries, you may want to have a look at these. \n\n\nA: Make sure that there aren't any background apps processes running on your iPhone. Insufficient memory on your iPhone could cause it to restart while memory-intensive processes could drain the battery quicker than usual.\n", "Q: What does unregister really do? Today I lost my iPhone and because of that I proceeded to unregister it from Apple as http://support.apple.com/kb/ht2526 indirectly suggests.\nWhat does it really mean to unregister a product?\n\nA: It removes it as being registered to your name in Apple's system. When you call Apple support from the iPhone, a screen pops up saying your name, the serial number of the phone, and information related to the phones previous issues. When you unregister it, that information goes away and it appears as a device that has yet to be registered.

If i backspace to the word, I see an overlay with the word as I typed it, but can't figure how to revert to it without using the mouse. Any suggestion?\n\nA: ⌘ Command + z for Undo will undo the auto-correct.\n\nA: After you've got the overlay with the previous, uncorrected spelling, you can press the down arrow key, then Return/Enter. This accepts the selected, uncorrected spelling.\n\n\n\n\nA: Same.

I'm thinking of replacing my home router (an older D-Link box) with the latest gen Airport Express base station. \nI currently have an older Airport Express unit (like this) that I want to use in another part of the house to extend the network, but not sure if the latest Express units can be extended... \nOr do I need to get the Airport Extreme to function as the base? \n\nA: Looks like the answer is Yes. \nFrom Apple Forums:\n\nThe AirPort Express can only \"extend\" a wireless signal....using\n  wireless only....from another AirPort Extreme, Time Capsule, or\n  AirPort Express.\n\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/4650868?start=0&tstart=0\n\nA: Yes you can extend the network this way. But you will face half the performance on a bridged network that you will get with a simple wifi network, as well as face reliability issues. I've done this with Airport Express before and faced all those issues myself. Since then I build my networks differently, always with a four port wired router at the core and a hardwired or powerline (if the other router is really a long way away) connection to each router.\nIdeally you'd be able to hardwire an ethernet connection to both Airport Express from the older D-Link box. As the Airport Express wifi is unlikely to outrun the 100 BaseT wired on the older D-Link box, you'd enjoy great performance and great reliability with two independent wifi networks.\nBoth Airport Express can be set to use wired bridge which means all devices on both wifi networks would be using the same DHCP settings and would allow them to communicate directly (even over two different wifi networks). Curiously you'd actually get faster throughput this way than with bridged wifi as both Airport Express would be able to communicate at full speed with their respective devices.\n", "Q: Why does my 3TB Seagate HD keep formatting as a Logical Volume Group This is really annoying. I have a brand new Seagate 3TB 7200 RPM hard drive that I am trying to format/partition in Disk Utility. Every time I change any settings or erase the drive, it changes it to a Logical Volume Group and subsequently changes the partition to a Logical Partition. Then I have to use Disk Utility in terminal and manually erase it.\nThis is really weird because I have two of these exact same drives and I zeroed out and partitioned the first one a couple of months ago without any issue whatsoever. I am not doing anything different than I always do when setting up my HDs. \nI'm running OSX 10.8.4 on a 2009 Mac Pro. \nEdit:\nI am not trying to make a Fusion Drive. The drive will be partitioned as GUID Partition Table with 1 partition and Mac OS Extended (Journaled) and then when I erase the drive or change the number of partitions, or the partition map—any of these adjustments makes it instantly a Logical Volume Group. Again, to clarify, this is ONE drive, I shouldn't be able to make it a fusion.\n\nA: I also have this issue... MacPro, 3TB drive (Seagate).

I am writing a book and trying to add a service to provide syntax highlighting to text selected in Pages with Automator. I have a service accepts selected text and runs it through a shell command (pygmentize) which converts it to syntax highlighted RTF.\nThe problem is that when the text is returned, Automator treats it as plain text and I get gibberish back. I've tried changing the accepts back and forth between rich and plain and it doesn't make any difference. I've tried piping the output through textutil to no avail.\nMy only work around for now is to have the shell command copy to the clipboard with pbcopy and then use an Automator to grab the contents of the clipboard. I'd rather find a way to do this without having to wipe the clipboard, any suggestions for getting Automator to treat my shell commands output as rich text?\nIs there anyway to make this work with AppleScript?\n\nA: I usually use scripts like this instead of Automator services:\ntry\n    set old to the clipboard as record\nend try\ntell application \"System Events\" to keystroke \"c\" using command down\ndo shell script \"export LC_CTYPE=UTF-8; pbpaste | /usr/local/bin/pygmentize -g -f rtf | pbcopy\"\ntell application \"System Events\" to keystroke \"v\" using command down\ndelay 0.05\ntry\n    set the clipboard to old\nend try\n\n\n\n*\n\n*If the clipboard is empty, trying to get it results in an error.\n\n*pbpaste and pbcopy use ASCII if the locale variables are unset. I couldn't get pygmentize -f rtf to work with non-ASCII characters though.\n\n*Without the delay set the clipboard to old would sometimes be run before the text would get pasted.\n\n\nA: Possible Race Condition\nI'm learning a lot from @Lauri Ranta's answer, but I think that the answer can still be improved.\nI believe that her script has what's called a \"race-condition\".  A race-condition can be a problem because it is a \"race\" to see which process will finish first.  There is the pbcopy process which could take different amounts of time, depending upon how much text is being copied, and then there's the delay process in AppleScript which pauses for the same amount of time, but it might not be enough time.  Maybe a race-condition is why the delay was needed to prevent an error from occurring, I'm not sure, but it could be a problem.\nFor race conditions, you don't want to pause too long and slow everything down and you don't want to pause to little and cause a possible data loss such as the old clipboard being restored when pbcopy is still copying.\nI believe that it would be good to call the Unix command called \"wait\" as part of the shell script to wait for the pbcopy to finish and then do away with the call to \"delay\" in the AppleScript portion.  That just feels better to me.\n", "Q: Choose Default Out CHANNEL for OS X Audio I need to get my default audio output to outputs 3/4 of my audio interface. What is the easiest way to do this?

The name I randomly chose was \"._\". The folder immediately disappeared and Finder would not allow me to undo the operation. (I know; bad convention, but it was going to be temporary, so didn't think it would be an issue.)\n*** NOTE: Viewing invisible files/folders was already turned on before this incident. *** (I can still see hidden files except THIS one.)\nLooking through Finder, the folder was no longer visible. It was also not indexable (of course) by Spotlight Search.\nSo, two questions...\n\n\n*\n\n*Primarily, \"How do I get it back?\"\n\n*Why did this happen? Is \"._\" a reserved system name? Is this repeatable?\n\n\nUPDATE: Language addressing $ cd into the wrong working directory was removed from OP to reduce ambiguity and verbosity. Corrected solution moved to answer section.\n\nA: All files and directories starting with . are Finder hidden files. System reserved dot directories are . for current directory and .. for parent directory. This is carried on from OS X Unix heritage.\nFor your file, there is a chance that you have an extra space after the _ or some unprintable character. Try mv ._ then hit TAB to find out if it will perform a completion on the name. If it does then continue typing the new name you desire. Note that you might need to hit TAB twice or more until you get that particular file name displayed in case you had other files that start with ._ in that directory.\nNote that files and directories starting with . can be viewed in Finder upon desire and that you can search for on ASK DIFFERENT. They are called hidden files.\n\nA: How to Get it Back\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Terminal\n\n*Navigate to folder containing missing \"._\" file/folder.\n\n*Run $ ls -a to confirm existence of \"._\".\n\n*Rename $ mv ._ ._something_else\n\n*VOILA!

So my iPhone was just stolen. I have a long - 8 digit - pin. I'm also on the beta version of iOS 7. I think I have Find my iPhone installed and enabled.\nIt's apparently \"offline\" - it's standard practice to turn a phone off straight after stealing it, according to the police. I gave the police my Apple logon details, and I'm hoping the crims are dumb enough to turn it back on at some point.\nI don't know whether I need to or should cancel my SIM. I'm sure they won't be able to get in to the phone for a while, at least until iOS 7 is publicly cracked. My concern is them taking out the SIM and racking up a phone bill. I'm on Tesco Mobile so the contract is cheap, but overages and non-UK-geographic calls are a bitch.\nIs my SIM in any way protected?\n\nA: If you did not use a dedicated SIM-Pin then your SIM is not protected.\nIn other words, if you lose your iPhone someone can easily take the SIM card out of the iPhone and use it it in a different phone.\nThe iPhone PIN only protects the contents of the iPhone NOT the SIM card.\nYou have to use a SIM pin to protect the SIM card, it's available in the iPhone settings.\nSo if you lost an unlocked/unprotected SIM card, you should immediately call your provider and cancel the SIM card. They can send you a new one.\n", "Q: How do I stop my 2013 Macbook Air from putting the computer to sleep?

How can I do this?\nThanks for your help.\n\nA: knodi was close, but pmset sleep 180 does not mean \"180 x display sleep time\" it simply means 180 minutes.\nBefore you change any of your pmset settings, I would take note of your current settings. If you enter this line in Terminal.app:\nsudo pmset -g live | tee -a ~/Desktop/original-pmset.txt\nit will show you the current pmset settings and it will also save a copy to ~/Desktop/original-pmset.txt so you can keep it as a reference.\nManipulating computer sleep time with pmset\nIf I want my MacBook Air to go to skeep after 60 minutes of idle time when it is plugged into wall/AC power, I can set that using:\nsudo pmset -c sleep 60\nSimilarly,\nsudo pmset -c sleep 0\ntells my MacBook Air not to put the computer to sleep, even if the display goes to sleep.\nIf I wanted that same setting for when the MacBook is on battery power (not AC/wall power), then I would use\nsudo pmset -b sleep 0\nI can also set different sleep times for disksleep and displaysleep\n(You can read more about pmset at https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/pmset.1.html or man pmset in Terminal.)\nI would be very interested to know if sudo pmset -c sleep 60 (or whatever value you choose) actually works for a Haswell-based MacBook Air.\n\nA: Maybe not the best answer but hope this might help a bit.\nNot sure why you don't have the options I have.\nBut it might be because you have a macbook air.\nThis is how it looks like on my macbook pro:\n\nI actually use an app called caffeine:\n\nCaffeine is a tiny program that puts an icon in the right side of your menu bar.

This seems to work, macbook air won't fall at the normal sleep rate, 2x of the display sleep time.\n", "Q: What makes a webpage's sound continue after the page is closed? Some websites that have sound/music keep the sound running even after the web browser is closed on iPad. Some other websites stop the sound when the page is closed. I suppose there must be some coding within the HTML to control this. How is this done?\n\nA: As you may see, websites that keep the music running appear as the music app (here on iOS 6) \n\nIt uses the HTML5 audio feature. In the website you gave (coffitivity.com). They use the JPlayer plugin for jquery to use the HTML5 audio API. \n\nA: I was able to get this to stop on my iPad Air by going to Settings->General->Multitasking and turning off Persistent Video Overlay. (I did leave multitasking turned on.)\n\nA: The same seems to happening under Safari Version 7.0.1 (9537.73.11) and MacOSX 10.9.1.\nA youtube video is watched and then a new web site is opened by typing a new address into the address bar. The new web site is loading but the youtube video sound still continues. closing the window and opening a new window \"resolves\" this. \n\nA: It plays out of cache when it is started. Whatever page you're on will attempt to download the entire audio and video in order to give the user a higher quality playback. There's an issue in the latest Facebook on iPhone where the audio keeps playing even after leaving the post. Depending on how much cache memory was used the audio will just keep on playing. For Facebook they blindly added the caching feature and didn't bother flushing it or killing the related process. It's called lazy development and poor QA result decisions. Releasing the rest of the updates was more important than fixing the symptom.\nFor the posts about minimizing the window I can only say LOL.... Good god. The active pages don't stop just because you minimized the window or opened a new tab while leaving the original open.\n", "Q: Missing library file: libSM.6.dylib When executing an application I receive the following error:\n./WordMaker WordMaker_BatchConfig.moos\ndyld: Library not loaded: /opt/local/lib/libSM.6.dylib\n  Referenced from: /Users/josh/Desktop/FabMapV2_MacOSX/bin/./WordMaker\n  Reason: image not found\n\nIt appears that this library file relates to X11, which I have installed (i.e. XQuartz), however it is located at /usr/X11/lib/.\nHow do I fix this problem?

I recently replaced the ribbon cable which connects the top case assembly on my macbook pro 4,1 (early 2008).  My keyboard is now working but unfortunately the fans are reving up to 6000 rpms and staying there.  after a visit to the apple store i've discovered it's due to a faulty palm rest heat sensor.\nsurprisingly, the genius at apple failed to inform me that this particular heat sensor is actually part of the cable i replaced.\nnow i could go buy another cable, but seeing as these run $80 a pop i thought wouldn't it be nifty if i could tell my mac to simply ignore the faulty sensor and just rely on the 13 others which are working fine.\npresumably this is a function of the SMC, but can it be changed? \nas a temporary workaround, i found a nifty little terminal utility which allows me to set a slower fan speed.  obviously this is less than ideal for a variety of reasons, but it does prove that user interaction with the SMC isn't impossible.\nany ideas?\n\nA: I have the same problem.  I used this program.  You can set which sensor (only one as far as I can tell) to tip the fan to higher speeds.  Best solution I could find, but if one of your other chips overheats, you might be out of luck.\nhttp://www.crystalidea.com/macs-fan-control?ref=fancontrol_mac\n\nA: You could install \"HDD Fan Control\" and control the fan speed with different parameters.

I could fully automate spinning up a headless VM, except that I need to know the IP of my host machine for configuring VNC stuff. \nI use either of the following two commands to get the current IP address:\nipconfig getifaddr en1      # For IP address assigned to wireless\nipconfig getifaddr en0      # For IP address assigned to ethernet\n\nThe problem is that I have to tell my script whether to use en0 or en1. I use wireless at home and ethernet at work, so I can't make an assumption.\nI could use:\nifconfig | grep '192'\n\nand parse the resulting line (both work and home assign class C addresses), but I'd rather not have to do that.\nIs there a way to determine which NIC is currently connected to the network from the command line? Or at least a better way of determining the host IP?\nMy machine uses Mountain Lion, if that's relevant.\n\nA: I would think your problem is determining \"service order.\" The basic magic you see happen in the System Preferences > Network where the highest ranking connected service sorts to the top.\nThis Mac OS Hints article discusses a similar problem and solution.\n\nA: How about \nifconfig -au|egrep \"en\\d:\"|cut -d: -f1\n\nwhich will show you the names of any 'en' interfaces that are in an up state\n", "Q: Software recommendations for projector titles/slides and simple visual effects at an event I'm looking for recommendations for software to use to run companion slides and visual effects on a projector screen at a public event.\nIdeally, I'd like something that can:\n\n\n*\n\n*Show titles/slides full-screen on an externally connected display\n\n*Show movies full-screen on demand\n\n*Show specific images on demand (i.e. 'go to John Doe's introductory slide', which I don't think a presentation tool like Keynote could achieve given its reliance on slide order)\n\n*Show simple visually interesting animated graphics - something to leave running while people are finding their seats.\n\n*Preferably be free or relatively cheap.\n\n\nI considered Processing, but it seems a bit heavyweight for my needs. Keynote and PowerPoint are probably insufficient, given that I will need to jump around my different items quite a bit if the event order changes, and I can't really exit the presentation and click on a different slide while the event's running.\nThanks in advance for any recommendations.\n\nA: You can do this in either Keynote or Powerpoint by building a simple menu system in a master slide. Simplest is to build a menu slide that will hold all the content you want to target and jump to. Then make a link back to this main menu slide on the master of all your slides. You can make it visible or quite small. Your choice. \nIn Keynote the main menu slide is done via Insert > Text Hyperlink.\nIn Powerpoint you have far greater capability with macros, but can easily jump to a slide in the same way. \nI believe macros can be linked to text or graphics (button) where with Keynote, it's a text link. \n\nA: The previous answer is an excellent one.  An alternate is to use Presenter View in PowerPoint, where one screen shows a view specific to the presenter (the previous link will show you a screenshot of it in PowerPoint for Windows; it's also available in PowerPoint:Mac), and shows the actual slides on the projector.  In Presenter View, you can see the full list of slides, and you can elect any of them.  This means that you can jump to any slide in the presentation without it being visible to the audience.  \nThis is obviously also useful for regular presentations, where a future slide answers a question that has been raised in the audience.  You can just jump to that slide, answer their question, and then go back to where you were with a minimum of fuss.\n", "Q: Periodic update of macports Yet again it happened.

Inside this file, add the following line:\nexport PATH=$PATH:/foo/bar\n\nthen save and quit. Exit Terminal.app (or whichever term program you're using) and restart it. /foo/bar should now be in your search path, to make sure type echo $PATH and see if it's at the end.

I'm trying to download the wwdc videos using curl .. however, my mac goes onto sleep mode after an hour. Can I resume the half-completed downloads or do I have to re-start?\n\nA: You could try using wget -c:\n-c\n--continue\n    Continue getting a partially-downloaded file.  This is useful when you\n    want to finish up a download started by a previous instance of Wget, or\n    by another program.  For instance:\n\n            wget -c ftp://sunsite.doc.ic.ac.uk/ls-lR.Z\n\n    If there is a file named ls-lR.Z in the current directory, Wget will\n    assume that it is the first portion of the remote file, and will ask the\n    server to continue the retrieval from an offset equal to the length of\n    the local file.\n\n", "Q: Which free alternatives to Little Snitch can I use to block internet traffic per applications? Little Snitch can block internet traffic of a particular app. Can I do something similar without (paying) Little Snitch, either by using free alternatives or configuring the OS X firewall directly?\n\nA: Use Radio Silence. Very simple application, but does the job nicely, however it costs $9.\n\nA: If you know which server an application is trying to contact, and want to stop it from doing so, you can reroute all communication to a bogus IP address (like 0.0.0.0) or just reroute traffic to itself (the local host).

Install it, restart the machine, open System Preferences and select TCPBlock. Unlock the pane then select the plus icon then Select Applications and choose Adobe Photoshop.\n\n(sorry about download.com link)\n\nA: TCPBlock\n\nTCPBlock is a lightweight and fast application firewall … you can prevent selected applications on your computer from opening connections to the network.\n\nTCPBlock is free and can be downloaded from MacUpdate, however TCPBlock doesn't appear to work with El Capitan and is no longer being updated.\nPF Firewall\nOS X comes with the PF firewall, which can be configured to block all connections to certain servers in all apps. Blocking all connections from a single app is not possible as far as I am aware without external software.\nYou can use IceFloor as a GUI for the PF firewall.\n\n\nA: LuLu is a great free, shared-source, macOS firewall that can block unknown outgoing connections, unless explicitly approved by the user. It runs on OSX 10.12+ and runs well on macOS Mojave. It can be configured to allow or block Apple signed binaries and has clear GUI based rule set that can be edited. Whilst it is free users are encouraged to support its development - which seems fair.\n\nA: I think you can through the firewall as stated in this article:\n\n\n*\n\n*Click the System Preferences icon in the Dock.\n\n*Click the Security icon.\n\n*Click the Firewall tab.\n\n*Click the Start button to turn on your firewall.\n\n*Click the Advanced button.\n\n*Click the Automatically Allow Signed Software to Receive Incoming Connections radio button to select it.\n\nThis enables the firewall.

My iPhone was stolen this morning. I've had the SIM, but not the IMEI blocked.\nIt was turned off immediately by the thief. I'm hoping that, as it's got the iOS 7 beta, they'll be unable to crack it and confused, and might turn it on. Will Find my iPhone still work if the SIM is blocked?\nThe network support guys assured me it works on a lower level than standard 3G internet access. Is this the case?\n\nA: In the limited sense that Find My Phone needs a data connection, blocking the 3G (or whatever G) data connection via the carrier would prevent a remote erase / location while the device is outside Wireless range of a known hotspot.\nFind My iPhone relies on a connection to the Internet, through any medium. Wi-Fi, cellular or cans with bits of string. If the thief connects it to the Internet, then it should be picked up by Find My iPhone, even if they don’t connect it via 3G.\nIf the thief turns the device on and connects it to the Internet, Find My iPhone will kick in.\nYou can check with Apple whether your Find My Phone enrollment should prevent activation of the device if they restore it to factory settings. Anyone running the publicly released iOS 7 version would not need to block the SIM as the activation lock would prevent removing the Find My Friends association by preventing an erase / restore cycle.\nFinally, the cell company still could locate the device by their cell towers whether the IMEI/SIM is blocked or not.\n", "Q: How can I extract the Mountain Lion installer from the recovery partition I just got a new macbook pro, and I want to swap out the internal hard disk with an SSD. My machine did not come with install media, so I was planning on trying to make some based on the recovery partition.\nI have already used sudo chflags nohidden BaseSystem.dmg to get to the BaseSystem.dmg file on the recovery partition, but it is only 456.6MB, far to small to contain the (4.3GB? 4.75GB) Mountain lion install disk image. Where is the disk image hidden?\n(I have blank DVDs of both sizes, but no erasable USB sticks.)\n\nA: You don't need to worry about having to copy any data, making USB sticks or having the media present. Use Mountain Lion's Internet Recovery procedure, all files is downloaded and installed on the new drive without having any files.\nYou replace the HDD and start with Command-R...\nSee OS X Internet Recovery for more info about the procedure, quote:\n\nIf you happen to encounter a situation in which you cannot start from the Recovery System, such as your hard drive stopped responding or you installed a new hard drive without OS X installed, new Mac models introduced after public availability of OS X Lion or OS X Mountain Lion, automatically use the OS X Internet Recovery feature if the Recovery System (Command-R method above) doesn't work. OS X Internet Recovery lets you start your Mac directly from Apple's Servers. The system runs a quick test of your memory and hard drive to ensure there are no hardware issues.\nOS X Internet Recovery presents a limited interface at first, with only the ability to select your preferred Wi-Fi network and, if needed, enter the WPA passphrase. Next, OS X Internet Recovery will download and start from a Recovery System image. From there, you are offered all the same utilities and functions described above.\n\nRegarding \"Where is the [OS X] disk image hidden?\", the Recovery Partition is a minimal bootstrap that connects to a wi-fi network to download the complete OS X 10.8 install, that's why it is so small. See here for further info: About OS X Recovery.\n\nA: So, here's how I got a Mountain Lion Install DVD from the recovery partition. It's a crazy workaround.\nI started with this article (http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20110831105634716&query=lion+usb) \n\n\n*\n\n*Mount the invisible recovery partition.\n\n*Mount the invisible BaseSystem.dmg disk image.\n\n*Run the Installer from there, targeting a USB stick with >5gb free space.\n\n*When the machine reboots, yank the USB Stick out.\n\n*After it boots normally, reinsert the USB stick and look around on it for the InstallESD.dmg\n\n*Burn the InstallESD.dmg to a DVD\n\n*Replace your hard drive\n\n*Install from the DVD.\n\n\nI do not recommend this procedure; It's persnickity and slow. Also, the only advantages it has over making a bootable USB drive is that you don't have to erase your USB stick, and you get a DVD backup installer in the end.\n", "Q: How to export files from hard drive in Snow Leopard CD? I have a macbook 5,1 that won't startup. I'm going to reinstall Snow Leopard with the CD, but is there a way to export some of the files that are in it? I can't seem to gain access to them through the terminal in the SL CD:\ncd Desktop outputs  No such file or directory\nand\npwd outputs  var/root\nif I cd ~/ then ls, there is only a Library folder, and no Users folder etc.\n\nA: Keep in mind that you are booted to a different volume/system when you boot to the installer DVD.\nWith that in mind you can use ls /Volumes to get a list of volume names.\nPresumably you will see Macintosh HD (or different name if you renamed the internal volume) listed, if so you can use cd /Volumes/Macintosh\\ HD to switch to the internal drive. If your internal drive is named differently then keep in mind that spaces should be replaced with \\ (a backslash followed by a space) in Terminal. Once you're in the correct volume your earlier commands should work as expected.\nThat same ls /Volumes command should show the path of your external hard drive as well.  You could copy the files using something along the lines of cp /Volumes/Macintosh\\ HD/file1.jpg /Volumes/Backup\\ Drive/Folder1.\nIf you are attempting to copy everything from the hard drive you can use the following command to force a copy of everything, skipping over corrupted data that would otherwise cause the process to hang or stop...\ncp -Rfv /original/data /destination/drive\n\nor, following my previous example\ncp -Rfv /Volumes/Macintosh\\ HD/ /Volumes/Backup\\ Drive/\n\n", "Q: Is there a way to use a Thunderbolt monitor with Bootcamp (WIndows 7) and not need to restart each time it's connected? So, I'm using a brand new Mac Book Pro with Bootcamp and Windows 7 and I have at giant 27\" thunderbolt display.  The problem I'm having is at the office I take my laptop with me to meetings.  Upon returning, when I plug the monitor in (as I did with previous monitors) this one will not turn back on.  I am required to restart Windows each time which is, well, unacceptable.\nSince the FAQ says that Bootcamp requires a reboot once the display has been ejected. I would like to spend money on hardware or time/money on software to get around this design limitation.\nHow can Windows and thunderbolt displays work the same way as OS X with respect to not requiring an OS restart to reconnect the display?\n\nA: Yes.\n\nThunderbolt hot plug is supported under Windows 8 or 8.1 on all 2014 and later Mac computers.\n\nNo - if you run older OS or hardware. In that case, this appears to be something you have to live with. The options are running Windows in a virtual machine so that Apple’s OS X drivers handle the hot plug for you or interrupt your workflow to accommodate the Windows drivers.

I have a 17\" MacBook Pro and occasionally need to design software that's optimized for smaller resolutions. Some of them I can work with by setting my display's resolution to the target system's, but there are a few resolutions (1400x900, for example) that aren't supported on my machine.\nIs there a utility that will display a rectangle on the screen that will show me what the resolution would be for smaller displays?\nBTW, I'm using Mac OS X 10.8.4 (Mountain Lion).\nThanks,\nChuck\n\nA: have a look at xscope.\nIts not expensive and it has \"Screens\" and \"Frames\" function which both should to be doing what you need.\n\nA: If you just need an outline (or more) that shows a specific size, why not just create an image and use it as a wallpaper?

So try adding the line to .bash_profile instead.\n\nA: Most Bash shell customizations, including the PS1 shell prompt, should be set in ~/.bashrc, which applies to all interactive shells.\nYou'll also need a ~/.bash_profile—which should only contain items for login shells—and it should source ~/.bashrc, e.g.,\n[ -r ~/.bashrc] && . ~/.bashrc\n\nIf you have a ~/.profile it should only contain POSIX-compatible commands and nothing Bash-specific, which means you should prefer to use ~/.bash_profile for login commands when you have a ~/.bashrc for it to source.\n", "Q: Why doesn't my VPN work with my new Mac?

How do I set up Xcode to use this and not the built-in version of clang?\n\nA: This is a copy of my answer on StackOverflow: How can I force Xcode to use custom compiler?.\n\nPeople say it is possible with custom toolchains. I didn't make a research on them because easier solution worked well for me:\n\nIt is also possible to run frontend plugins directly by setting appropriate \"build settings\" of Xcode. (Several ways to do this, you can set them on the command line for instance: xcodebuild build FOO=bla.) Here are a few build settings that I found useful to inject C flags: \nOTHER_CFLAGS, OTHER_CPLUSPLUSFLAGS or to replace the compiler(s) and linker(s): \nCC, CPLUSPLUS, LD, LDPLUSPLUS, LIBTOOL \nThe same approach works to control the \"analyze\" action: CLANG_ANALYZER_EXEC, CLANG_ANALYZER_OTHER_FLAGS \nDisclaimer: some of those build settings are undocumented (afaik). Use at your own risk.\n\n(Taken from [cfe-dev] Compile/refactor iOS Xcode projects)\nFor me it was enough to define the following User-Defined Settings in Build Settings of Xcode projects:\nCC=my-c-compiler\nCXX=my-cxx-compiler\nLIBTOOL=my-linker-for-static-libraries\n\n\nA: Custom toolchain answer:\n\n*\n\n*See the structure of /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr because that's how you'll need to arrange your installation. Also we'll use the ToolchainInfo.plist file.\n\n\n*Copy the default xctoolchain bundle from above, and  paste it into ~/Library/Developer/Toolchains. In the ~/Library/Developer/Toolchains/my_toolchain.xctoolchain/ToolchainInfo.plist file, change the identifier to something else.\n\n\n*In the usr folder, delete the bin folder. Go to /usr/local and create a alias of the bin folder. Move that alias to usr folder in the toolchain. Do the same for every other folder. You can also create one single alias to the parent folder of the installation and rename it to usr and move it to toolchain file.\n\n\n*In ~/.bash_profile, add a line export TOOLCHAINS=org.llvm.13.0.0git or and replace the org.llvm.13.0.0git with your identifier.\n\n\n*Open Xcode, Xcode menu > Toolchains  > select your toolchain.\n\n\n*Every time you build a project, remember to set Enable index-while-building functionality to NO or you might get a build error.\n\n\n*For your custom Clang, you might need to set export SDKROOT=\"/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.14.sdk\" or corresponding to your OS in the ~/.bash_profile too.\n", "Q: Does the iTunes Affiliate Program work with the Volume Purchase Program? Can one earn affiliate commission through the iTunes Affiliate Program for purchases made through Apple's Volume Purchase Programs for Business or Education?\nIn case it makes a difference, we're based in the U.S., so we would be using the LinkShare-powered program.\n\nA: That would be called Double dipping.\nAs Volume purchasing (authorized) user you get the benefits of Volume purchase.\nMeans, you have to register with Volume Purchase account, that is not the same as the associate account.\nYou can not get at the same time the affiliate commission on top.\n", "Q: How can I convert a DMG to ISO on Mac OS X (preferably for free)? I have medical records within Windows software within a DMG disk image. How can I convert the DMG to an ISO format on Mac OS X? Is it possible to do it within Disk Utility or CLI easily, or do I need an external utility?\n\nA: You can use hdiutil to convert from .dmg to .iso directly:\n$ hdiutil makehybrid -iso -joliet -o [filename].iso [filename].dmg\n\nRenaming .cdr to .iso is bad advice! An .iso has a slightly different format that allows PC users to play the DVD as well.

Use Convert then select your dmg file. In the Save As dialog that follows, select DVD/CD master. Disk Utility will insist on saving the new ISO as a .cdr file, but it is really an ISO. You can rename it to .iso in the Finder, if you like.\nAt http://osxdaily.com/2012/07/18/convert-dmg-to-cdr-or-iso-with-disk-utility/ there are screen shots that walk through this process.\n\nA: You must mount the cdr people.\n", "Q: How to tell whether Little Snitch is running or stopped?

I am curious as to how I get the max connection? Option + Click on my WiFi shows I am connected only using \"n\" and on the 2.4Ghz frequency. Why would it not be on \"ac\" and 5Ghz?\n\nA: Operating at 5GHz means that (in the margin - there are other factors) 802.11ac will penetrate walls, ceilings, floors less well than 802.11n at 2.4GHz.\nThe AirPort Utility allows you to setup a separate Network Name for the 5GHz frequency (Wireless Tab / Click Wireless Options). This means that you can explicitly select whether to connect a device via n/2.4GHz or ac/5GHz.\nIf you do this you can use /System/Library/CoreServices/Wireless Diagnostics  (via Option+Click on WiFi) described here: How to troubleshoot 802.11ac bandwidth problems (note don't continue with the default assistant - select Utilities from the Window menu) to examine the relative performance of ac/n from different locations.\nIn my case I observed that with clear line of sight ac reported a Tx Rate of 867 Mbps compared to 145 Mbps for n. In contrast, several rooms away ac dropped off to the extent that n had better performance.\nReverting the changes above (so both 2.4GHz and 5GHz have the same network name) and repeating the tests, saw the connection automatically switch from ac to n as signal dropped off. \nIn contrast, I've not (yet) seen an automatic switch from n to ac at a location where powering Wifi off/on gets (and holds) the ac connection. \nWhile less than perfect in terms of \"just doing the right thing\", this is perhaps understandable - triggering a switch when quality drops below some threshold rather than continuously looking for a \"better\" connection when what you've got (albeit n rather than ac) is rated as \"excellent\". Of course this is an OS X behaviour ... perhaps Mavericks will address it?      \n\nA: This behavior is still happening with a mid-2015 MacBook Pro 15\" and OS X 10.11.5.\nApparently, this is in spec:\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/message/23356016\n\nA: It seems to be a global problem affecting a lot of new MacBook Air. You may need to wait a software update. \nOn Cult of Mac\n", "Q: prevent doubleapple files creation when tarring directories (Snow Leopard) I'm looking how to prevent tar from saving or creating .AppleDouble shadow files and preferably do it in an automated manner. There are a few questions asking why this happens, but I want a solution that helps me prevent this in practice.\nWhat do I need to do using terminal when I tar a directory to prevent these files from being generated?\nThe duplicate (linked above) as it has been pointed out shows a whole bunch of lines which I do not understand. I'm pretty new to working with Terminal, so that is probably the reason why I don't grasp it.\n$ xattr -l file.jpg\ncom.apple.quarantine: 0002;50d20c48;Tweetbot;\n$ tar -cf 1.tar file.jpg \n$ tar -tf 1.tar \n./._file.jpg\nfile.jpg\n$ COPYFILE_DISABLE=1 tar -cf 2.tar file.jpg \n$ tar -tf 2.tar \nfile.jpg\n\nI just cannot imagine that every time I want to tar a directory I need this bunch only to achieve not getting duplicates.\nRegarding the solutions given below in the comments, does it mean that every time I want to tar something I have to use that whole line? Or is there a way to tell the system to set this as the default behaviour when tarring files?\n\nA: @LauriRanta answered the question by giving two solutions. \nThe first solution is to use COPYFILE_DISABLE=1 tar -cf directory.tar directory each time you want to tar a directory without the hidden files.\nHer 2nd solution however - and also the one I was looking for - shows how to automate the whole lot by using an alias. If you don't know what an alias is (I didn't) there is a great tutorial available here that shows how to create a temporary alias (only valid for current session) and a permanent alias (stays valid even after turning your Mac off).\nI used Lauri's suggestion with a few additions to create a permanent alias:\nalias tarc=\"COPYFILE_DISABLE=1 tar --exclude '\\\\.DS_Store' -zcf\"\n\nso next time I want to tar a directory without overhead I only have to write tarc chosen-gzipped-tar-filename.tgz name-of-directory-i-want-to-tar/ and beam it up to my webhost.\nThanks for all comments and input!\n", "Q: Why browsers ignores /etc/hosts behind a SOCKS proxy? My MacBook in office does not have internet access. So I set up an instant SOCKS Proxy over SSH to surf the web.\nHowever, when I try to add an entry to /etc/hosts, the browser does not go to the site I expected ...\nMy MacBook's WIFI is off and is connected to the company LAN:\n IP address:  192.168.8.250\n Subnet mask: 255.255.255.0\n Router:      192.168.8.1\n DNS server:  8.8.8.8\n\nBe default, there is not internet access.\nThere a Linux development box (192.168.12.128) which has access to the internet, so I set up an instant SOCKS proxy to gain internet access for my MacBook:\n ssh -fND localhost:30000 ohho@192.168.12.128\n\nThen in my MacBook's System Preferences > Network > Proxies\n (Enable) SOCKS Proxy\n SOCKS Proxy sever: 127.0.0.1:30000\n Bypass proxy settings for these Hosts & Domains:\n   *.local, 169.254/16, 127.0.0.1\n\nNow I can surf the web, so far so good.\nFor development, I set up a few entries in /etc/hosts for virtual hosts purpose:\n 127.0.0.1 air.company.com\n\nIn bash:\n $ ping air.company.com\n PING air.ohho.es (127.0.0.1): 56 data bytes\n 64 bytes from 127.0.0.1: icmp_seq=0 ttl=64 time=0.046 ms\n\n $ curl air.company.com\n <html>OK</html>\n\nIt looks good and curl returns the content of the index.html nicely.\nHowever, if I try to open the site:http://air.company.com in the browsers (Safari/Chrome/Firefox), none of them returns the result like curl did. Chrome give an error:\n\nThis webpage is not available The webpage at http://air.company.com/\n  might be temporarily down or it may have moved permanently to a new\n  web address.

Why?\np.s.\nIf I disable the SOCKS proxy, the browser returns the content from 127.0.0.1 correctly.\nIf I disconnect the LAN cable, the browser returns the content from 127.0.0.1 correctly.\n\nA: Your browser is asking the SOCKS proxy for the sites, it is not connecting directly. Therefore putting the IP address in the exceptions list doesn't work, as your computer is not performing the look up of air.company.com to 127.0.0.1. The SOCKS proxy is.\nTo avoid this, place the full domain name of what you are accessing locally in the exceptions list in System Preferences > Network > Proxies.\nSo for air.company.com you'd see an exception list (from your example above) of:\n  *.local, 169.254/16, 127.0.0.1, air.company.com\n\nYour computer will now connect to air.company.com directly, and therefore make use of /etc/hosts.\n", "Q: How to uninstall TrueCrypt? How to uninstall TrueCrypt 7.1a from my Mac cleanly? The instruction on TrueCrypt website is Windows-only.\n\nA: The TrueCrypt installer is an mpkg file that contains multiple pkg files within it. You can right click the installer in Finder, open package contents and see the pkg files. Essentially, it installs MacFUSE and the TrueCrypt application. If you examine the TrueCrypt mpkg file with a tool like Pacifist, you'd see the list of files it installs and the locations.\nTrueCrypt does not come with an uninstaller on OS X. But there are at least two ways to attempt to uninstall it completely:\n\n\n*\n\n*According to help on the TrueCrypt forum, uninstalling it is a matter of removing MacFuse and the TrueCrypt app (you need to have an account on that forum to see this post):\n\nsudo /Library/Filesystems/fusefs.fs/Support/uninstall-macfuse-core.sh\n  sudo rm -rf /Applications/TrueCrypt.app\n\nOR\n\n*Try UninstallPKG to uninstall any application installed with a package (requires OS X 10.8 or later). I haven't used this, and do not know if it will be able to remove MacFUSE and TrueCrypt.\nOnce you've done this, check the list of files/locations reported by Pacifist, see if any of those are still around and remove them.\n\nA: Are you seeing a installation folder or an .exe file. Either way, the installation would not have gone anywhere, and I think it should safe to delete either. After you complete the delete, you can run a search for \"TrueCrypt\" to see if anything is left, but I doubt it would be.\nHowever, I ran a check on TrueCrypt (truecrypt.org) and there is an OSX installer. If you have that, there may be more to be done. But you said you got a Windows installer, so I'll leave it at that.\n", "Q: How to add a file into zip? I have a quite large zip file with archived documents and I want to add a new file into it. \nHow to do it quick and easy? The archive is quite large, so extract+add+compress+delete is not preffered option. \n\nA: AFAIK There's no (free) onboard app to achieve this.\nThe easiest way would be to do it via command line.\nzip /path/to/zipfile.zip file1 file2\n\nIf you want to add all(!) files within a directory and subdirectories, run\nzip -r /path/to/zipfile.zip /path/to/dir\n\nIt will also add .DS_Store files and that like, so be careful with the latter command.\nHowever, if you're fine with spending some money, you could take a look at http://macitbetter.com. They provide an app called BetterZip 2 which is also capable of doing what you want.\n\nA: For when you prefer a UI (versus command line), Commander One providers a free UI for direct viewing and editing of ZIP files.\n", "Q: Is it normal for a 15 inch rMBP to get extremely hot during use? Sometimes when editing images, creating websites, using Adobe software, my Retina  Macbook Pro, seems to get very, very hot. Not just on the bottom but on the top by the screen as well.\nTo be more specific, I own a 2013  15\" Retina Macbook Pro with a 2.4 Ghz i7. \nIs this normal? Could this damage my computer in any way? If so, should I do something to prevent it from happening?\n\nA: Your computer is designed to run all 4 cores and generate heat like a 60 w lightbulb would. Internally, the CPU doesn't get as hot as a filament does - but it does approach the boiling point of water before it will slow itself down to avoid overheating.\nThis control is built into the chips themselves so even if your fans stop working, the machine should run as fast as it can given the amount of heat that escapes through the warm aluminum frame. The heat that you have noticed may simply be the system working as designed with passive cooling assisting the fans.\nHere is an article explaining a bit on how you can measure the internal temperatures, how the loading of work on the CPU spins up (and even sound recordings of) the fans:\n\n*\n\n*http://www.anandtech.com/show/6023/the-nextgen-macbook-pro-with-retina-display-review/12\nMy guess is your mac is running normal as it can be quite uncomfortably hot and still operating as designed. However, if you are worried, you should call AppleCare and ask them for assistance in determining if it's running safely.  Rather than trust that our understanding of how hot your Mac is since you could be someone who is underestimating danger, or another that over estimates it and I'd hate to not have you get a second opinion or know exactly how hot the internals and case are. Consulting the manufacturer would be a great next step for you.\n\nA: The unit probably gets hot from pushing all those pixels with the discrete graphics card. If a mac gets too hot it will shut down before damage is done. I believe that functionality is built into intel CPUS. Forum post about shutdown temps.\nHave you tried cleaning your mac out with canned air? It might be a bit dirty inside. \n\nA: Mine gets plenty warm when I am using it for anything more than browsing the web or email. Actually, even when that is all i am doing, it doesn't exactly stay cool.\nAs mentioned in other answers, Intel CPUs do have excellent thermal protection built into them (unlike some other CPUs). There are videos on YouTube showing CPUs and how they behave when their heatsink was removed - don't try this at home, kids! One popular brand let out some of the magic smoke and died. The Intel one just got slow.\n", "Q: How to determine reason for SSH broken pipe Over the last week, my SSH connection to an Amazon EC2 instance keeps getting disconnected with\n\nWrite failed: Broken pipe\n\nReading through a few sites, I assumed it was due to no timeouts being set so I created a ~/.ssh/config file as follows based on \n\n\n*\n\n*https://superuser.com/questions/374087/how-to-increase-the-default-time-out-for-ssh-on-os-x\n\n*https://serverfault.com/questions/367205/error-encountered-when-setup-github-on-mac-write-failed-broken-pipe\n\n*http://www.ericmichaelstone.com/?p=5852\n\n### Stop timing out connections\nServerAliveInterval 120  \nServerAliveCountMax 20  \n\nTCPKeepAlive yes\n\n### SSH Connection pooling for faster additional connections to a machine\nControlMaster auto  \nControlPath /tmp/ssh_mux_%h_%p_%r\n\nHost *  \n  ControlMaster auto  \n  ControlPath ~/.ssh/control/%r@%h:%p  \n  ControlPersist 3600  \n\n### Make it so ssh-ing from one server to another passes keys around automagically\nHost *\nForwardAgent yes\n\n### Get rid of SSH connection delays\nGSSAPIAuthentication no\n\n### Use less encryption on servers I cant get to off-network\nHost 10.* 172.* 192.168.*  \nCiphers blowfish-cbc\n\n\nThese settings didn't seem to have an effect, yet I realized that when I'm not at home, the connection stays idle like it has for the last year.

Let's assume it's a variant of linux.  \nThe first thing you should do is increase the amount of logging your SSHD provides.  You have two ways of doing this.  You could either change the options so that SSHD always starts with the debug flags, or you could start up another instance on a non-standard port.  Either way, the secret to getting debug output is to use -d's.  From the man page on an Mint (Ubuntu variant) server \n\n\n-d      Debug mode.  The server sends verbose debug output to standard error, and does not put itself in the background.  The server also will not fork\n                 and will only process one connection.  This option is only intended for debugging for the server.  Multiple -d options increase the debugging\n                 level.  Maximum is 3.\n\n\nFrom your client, you can use the verbose options for ssh TO the server, such as ssh -vvv user@host.com -p port you used for your sshd.\nOne more thing I would suggest is to get rid of most of the items in your config file, just to make sure you're not adding to the problem.\nNone of these things are answers, but they could get you closer to one.  \n", "Q: Safari not accepting website certificate I've been using an internal website at work without any issues until today when I received the error message:\n\n\"Safari can't open the page \"https://...\". The error is: \"The server \"...\" did not accept the certificate.\" (NSURLErrorDomain:-1205)\n\nI've looked in my Keychain to see if there was a certificate that I could delete and re-add, but nothing shows up there matching the URL of the website. I've fixed this problem once in the past (accidentally) by deleting my entire keychain and starting over but I didn't mean to do it the first time and I'd rather not do it again.\nThe website does load without an issue in other browsers without any errors/warnings. It's just Safari that's barfing.\nHas anyone else seen this? Know how to fix it?\n\nA: I've since solved the problem, though I'm not sure if this is the right answer for everyone.\nThe problem seemed to come from the certificate automatically generated from apple (com.apple.idms.appleid.prd.[large character string]). A quick Google search didn't tell me what this certificate was for, but I'm sure that deleting it was probably not the best solution. Ignoring that thought, I deleted it anyway and now I can log in without a problem. I'm sure that something bad will happen with other things on my computer (private key, other certificates, something), but it hasn't happened yet so I'm calling it a win.\nUPDATE:\nA couple of months on, I still haven't had anything bad happen so I guess this solution didn't break anything else.\nUPDATE 2:\nAbout a year on, this problem still comes up from time to time (even with 10.10). I keep deleting the certificate in the keychain and it keeps working for a while.\n\nA: Have a look in \n\n/etc/certificates\n\nfor certificates that begin with your certificate name.\nCheck for any duplicates of the name with different GUID values.  If this is the case you will find that the certificate has either been updated or replaced at some point and is still registered to an application.\nCheck *.plist files for the particular certificate name to find where it is being used.  Then you can determine how to fix that particular case.\n\nA: Open Keychain Access to examine your Certificates. Sometimes I trash expired ones .. but instead of deleting a Certificate, you can tell the system to trust it. That's the place to do so.\n", "Q: possible to drive two external mointors with mid-2013 new macbook air?

The cursor sometimes start to lag. I figured, the reason for this could be the distance between my Mac and the mouse (about 1.5 meters / 5 foot). \nI bought an external USB Bluetooth dongle I want to plug into my monitor on my desk, so the mouse is closer to the controller. However, I can't figure out how to make OS X use the external dongle instead of the built in controller. \nWhen I go into System Prefs > Bluetooth and hold the Option key to display the reception, I see that it is the strongest when it's next to my Mac and not when it's next to the dongle. So what can I do to change that? Thanks!\n\nA: I've often had the exact same problem! I've found that the following method works consistently to switch to the external adapter. Starting with the external bluetooth dongle unplugged:\n\n\n*\n\n*Turn off Bluetooth\n\n*Wait about three seconds\n\n*Plug in dongle\n\n*Again, wait about three seconds\n\n*Turn on Bluetooth\n\n\nThis works every time for me. No reboots or additional software required!\n\nAdditionally, there's a much quicker way to see which bluetooth adapter your mac is currently using. With your external Bluetooth adapter unplugged:\n\n\n*\n\n*If there's no Bluetooth icon in your menu bar, go to system prefs -> Bluetooth and check \"Show Bluetooth in menu bar\"\n\n*With the external dongle unplugged, option+click on the Bluetooth icon in your menu bar\n\n*Note the sequence of letters and numbers after \"Address:\". This is the name of your computer's internal Bluetooth adapter. (I usually just pay attention to the last two characters)\n\n\nNow, try to switch to your external adapter, and repeat the above steps. If the address changes, your computer is definitely using the external adapter.\n\nA: To force the system to use USB Bluetooth dongle by default, run the following command:\nsudo nvram bluetoothHostControllerSwitchBehavior=always\n\nThis will modify your boot kernel arguments.\nTo do opposite, use never. The change would be applied after the reboot. To return to the default, run:\nsudo nvram -d bluetoothHostControllerSwitchBehavior\n\n\nA: Looked in here: /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration. There i found a bluetooth plist file. I trashed it, rebooted, and then my USB dongle was finally recognized. I did not need to reset any SMC, NVRAM.\n\nA: I just went through this using this no-name adapter on OS X 10.10: http://www.amazon.ca/dp/B00E38N7QE/ref=pe_386430_30332290_TE_3p_dp_1\nThe easiest way to use the USB adapter is to reboot. If you hold down the Option key while clicking on the Bluetooth menu icon, the MAC address of the adapter should be different. You can also verify in System Profiler. You'll know it's working if any existing pairings break.\nI've found that a BT 4.0 adapter is working better than the built-in adapter in my 2010-era Macbook Pro. Especially with a headset, there's much better sound quality.\nThe on / off button in System Preferences is a little buggy. Turning off the adapter works fine, but clicking \"on\" turned the internal adapter back on. I had to unplug the adapter, plug it back in, and then turn Bluetooth back on.\nIf you want to work around this without rebooting, you can use Bluetooth Explorer from the OS X developer tools. You'll need a (free) developer account. There's a ton of useful tools to debug interference, pairing issues, and so on.\n\nThis is now part of a package called \"Hardware IO Tools for Xcode V x.x\" and can be found at https://developer.apple.com/downloads/\n\nA: You shouldn't have that much of a reception issue from 1.5 meters. Even with some interference between the mini and your mouse, BT should be fine so I might be suspect of something else causing the issue rather than the Mac Mini BT card. But yeah, go into System Preferences > Bluetooth and turn it off.\n", "Q: Gtk2 randomly crashes I have a small program in C that I wanted to add a GUI to, so after looking around I decided to use GTK+. I installed gtk2 using MacPorts (version installed was gtk2 @2.24.18_1+x11).\nI am compiling my program with\ngcc -Wall -Wextra -pendantic `pkg-config --libs --cflags gtk+-2.0` myprogram.c -lpthread -o myprogram\n\nThere are no errors during compilation, but when I run it, after some amount of time I will get random errors appearing such as:\nGdk:ERROR:gdkregion-generic.c:1110:void miUnionNonO(GdkRegion *, GdkRegionBox *, GdkRegionBox *, gint, gint): assertion failed: (y1 < y2)\n\nGdk:ERROR:gdkregion-generic.c:337:void miSetExtents(GdkRegion *): assertion failed: (pExtents->y1 < pExtents->y2)\n\nAssertion failed: (ret != inval_id), function _XAllocID, file xcb_io.c, line 529.\n\nFatal IO error 35 (Resource temporarily unavailable) on X server /tmp/launch-7OAilk/org.macosforge.xquartz:0.\n\nAssertion failed: (! xcb_xlib_unknown_req_in_deq), function dequeue_pending_request, file xcb_io.c, line 179.\n\nIt looks to me like these errors are caused by a bug in Gtk/Gdk/XQuartz, is there any easy way to fix this?\nI am running OS X Mountain Lion 10.8.4, XCode 4.6.2, and XQuartz 2.7.4 (xorg-server 1.13.0).\n\nA: This seems actually to just be a result of my poor programming. I was trying to perform drawing from a thread which was not the same thread that called Gtk_Main, resulting in undefined behaviour and the various error messages above.\n", "Q: Mac Book Pro 2013 battery I got a new Mac Book Pro, (not retina) and the battery indicator is only showing 98%.\nIs this something of concern? \nI have found this:\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/4228218?start=0&tstart=0\n\nSit and watch it constantly, this will take some hours, it will charge to 100% from time to time, usually just a little less (like 98, or 96) in order to protect the battery from overcharging.\n\nBut I was looking for something official, but couldn't find it.\nAnd the official \"battery link\" doesn't say anything about this:\nhttp://www.apple.com/batteries/notebooks.html\n\nA: I haven't found \"official\" information on this, both my 2007 Macbook and my 2011 Macbook Pro will rarely show a 100% charge, I assume it's normal behaviour.\nTake into account that the battery measurement is only an estimate so even if it shows 100% it does not mean that the battery has reached exactly full charge.\n", "Q: Possible to chain mac minis together? Is there a guide to extending a mac mini by adding several mac minis together to add cpu and memory capacity?\n\nA: What exactly is your use case? There is not any way to connect two Mac Minis together and have them function as a single machine. But there are ways to split the workload between two different Macs.\nSome programs may let you designate master and slave computers, which would allow you to have one computer control the actions of another. Isadora, a video/performance application, is one example.\nIf you're looking for a more general use case, there are multiple options for automating actions on a Mac. For example, if you wanted to offload converting video files via handbrake, you could have Hazel watching a folder on the second Mini. When you put a video file there, Hazel could automatically run handbrakecli with predefined settings.\nHere's an example rule:\n\nHere Hazel is watching the folder \"pinboard-backups\"1. When it sees a file that is a movie it runs a script executing handblakecli (I've set it up so that the converted file ends up back on the first Mini. You could have Hazel running there as well set up to rename the file).\n\nAfter it runs the script, it moves the file to the trash.\nThis is just one option; there's plenty of other methods out there. I'd be happy to help point you in a more specific direction if you let me know what you'd like to do.\n1: Probably not where you'd be keeping them, but the folder I was editing at the moment.\n\nA: I understand what you are asking, that is what is called a CCNUMA -- or Cache-Coherent Non-Uniform Memory Architecture.  The easiest thing to do computationally intensive tasks across multiple computers, whether Mac, GNU/Linux, UNIX, or Windoze, is to use MPI or Hadoop.\nMPI can, and is difficult to install and use without being a programmer.  Hadoop on the other hand can be relatively straight forward and is in fact used by Big Data, and CERN to mine, collect, and share data.\nHadoop uses Map/Reduce, which is fairly simple to understand, and thus to work with, implementation however, is not the most pleasant.\n", "Q: \"Verification Required\" when installing free apps? When I tried to install a free app, AppStore says:\n\nVerification Required\nBefore you can make purchases, you must tap Continue to sign in, then\n  verify your payment info.\n\nI never had this problem before. How do I install free apps without providing Apple with my credit card information?\n\nA: It is indeed possible to create an Apple ID without a credit card, see \"Creating an iTunes Store, App Store, iBookstore, and Mac App Store account without a credit card\" at http://support.apple.com/kb/ht2534.\nIf you entered credit card information in the past you can dissociate it from your Apple ID as follows.\nOn an iOS device\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Settings.\n\n*Tap iTunes & App Stores:\n\n\n*Tap your account and select \"View Apple ID\".\n\n*Select Payment information:\n\n\n*Select None:\n\n\n*Confirm with Done.\nOn a Mac\n\n\n*\n\n*Open App Store.app:\n\n\n*Select menu Store>View My Account.\n\n*In the Apple ID Summary section locate the Payment Information line and click Edit >:\n\n\n*Select None as payment method:\n\n\n\n*Click Done to confirm.\nIf you don't see a \"none\" option, you may need to disable family sharing and then try the above steps again.   \n", "Q: To set up Gmail app as default mail program in iPad? When I press some email-link on Safari, it goes to mail app.\nHow can you make it go to Gmail app?\n\nA: At the moment, unfortunately, Apple doesn't allow default apps to be changed.\nSome apps came up with various hacks to open Google Chrome instead of Mobile Safari when you press a web page link within that app but at the moment there is no such hack for mailing. And if there was, frankly, Apple would't implement it into Safari themselves.\nMaybe in the future, Apple will allow default apps to be changed but basically you're stuck right now.

I downloaded Adobe Reader, Cloud Readers, iBooks and PDF Reader iPhone edition from the App Store, but all of them require iOS 5.\nPlease suggest the best PDF reading app for iOS 4.2.1, or suggest some steps to upgrade to iOS 5.\n\nA: The 2nd generation iPod touch can’t be upgraded to iOS 5.\nOne PDF reader that still works on pre-iOS 5 devices is GoodReader, although according to their site it requires iOS 4.3.\nIf you connect your iPod touch to iTunes, then there should be an option to update to iOS 4.3. The instructions in this Apple Support article explain how to update an iOS 4 device (see Update your device using iTunes).\nThere may be other PDF readers that can run on iOS 4 devices, but I don’t know of any by name. Pre-iOS 5 devices are now a very thin sliver of the iOS installed base, so most developers have dropped support for them.\n\nA: Here are some I discovered using vintapps 3.1.3:\nAdvanced PDF Reader,\niPDF,\nPDF Word Excel File Viewer,\nPdF+,\nReflowPPDF\n\nA: Sorry, but your iPod cannot upgrade to iOS 4.3.1/5.0.1.

I have recently used the terminal and entered the command sudo -s and then dscl . -list /users  so I could see all accounts/users who have access to my mac. \nHow do I know which names are supposed to be there and which aren't? Luckily I read on another post that nobody and daemon appeared in their list so that calms me down slightly, but does anyone have a link to a list of which accounts are suppose to be there? \nRight now, there are over 25 names, a lot look like file locations but I am freaked out!\n\nA: All users account starting with an _ are automatically generated by the system. For example, _lp is an account used to manage the Printing Services without the use of the priviledged account root.\nThis is a separation of priviledges and a good protection.\nFor all other account names,\ndaemon and nobody are also generated by the system.\nFor the remaining accounts, let's say you see a suspect user account bond, use the following command:\nfinger bond\n\nto check what bond account is used for and when it was last used to connect on your system.\n", "Q: Hazel rule using Python script I am using a Hazel (Noodlesoft) rule with Python script.

The Iphone is not synced to this Macbook but to my home computer, but I'm away from home, and I don't want to sync it to the Macbook because it will wipe everything else in the phone.\nI could copy the file from the Macbook to Dropbox and download it to the Iphone from there, but my net connection here is pretty slow. Isn't there any way to copy the file from the Mac to the Iphone without syncing?\nI'm using OS X 10.8.2 in the Macbook, iOS 5.1.1 on the Iphone and iTunes 10.6.3.\n\nA: You can use iTunes to move files directly without a sync over USB.\n\n\n*\n\n*Attach your iPhone, iPod or iPad with the datacable to your the Mac.\n\n*In iTunes, in the top right corner, click on your device. In my case it's an iPad.\n\n\n*Now go the the 'Apps' tab and scroll down to 'File Sharing'\n\n\n*Choose the program you want to sent your file to\n\n\n*Click on the 'Add' bottom in the bottom right\n\nThe newer versions of Dropbox app supports syncing from their servers and local WiFi syncing over a LAN so you can experiment with this if you don't want to try iTunes. Apple's documentation can be found here. There are also third party tools that sync files, but for one file it's hard to justify downloading anything and just use iTunes for the task.\n\nA: The app I use to transfer any video out there into my iPhone is WALTR. It is Mac-compatible. The software is ridiculously simple. I just drag-and-drop the file and it appears in the native iOS app. The thing that I like the most is the fact that it gets the job done. I am very satisfied. \nYou can find a quick 2 step guide by following the link down below:\nhttp://softorino.com/waltr/windows-guides/transfer-video-iphone-6-without-itunes\n", "Q: Treat MacBook screen as monitor even when closed? Background\nI have a MacBook Pro running 10.8.3. I have one external monitor plugged in, and the MacBook is largely stationary because it is a work computer.\nWhen I go home for the night, I lock the screen, turn off the monitor, and close the laptop (I often have things running into the evening or overnight, hence no sleep or shutdown). When I arrive in the morning, I open the laptop and turn on the monitor, and all the windows are gathered on the laptop screen.\nI'm assuming what happens is that when I close the laptop, the OS decides that only the external monitor is an available display, makes it primary, and moves everything there, and then when the laptop opens it repositions everything to the \"new\" primary display.\nWhat I Want\nI want to be able to close the lid of my laptop, open it again, and have all of my windows be where I left them, all while leaving my external monitor plugged in. Is that possible?\n\nA: I'm not sure that this is quite the solution that you're looking for, but the utility Stay does make sure that windows return to a set position when connecting an external display. I haven't had a chance to use it myself, but since purchasing a new external display, I must say it's tempted me. \nYou might also check out this related thread on .SX, which has more suggestions.\nA quick search pulled up this article, which might also solve your question by disabling the sleep signal sent when you close the lid… Someone with stronger terminal-fu than myself might know some direct CLI commands to do this directly. \n", "Q: MacBook backlight turns off when brightness is set at 100% I was using my MacBook today when suddenly the backlight turned off, right while I was in the middle of using it. I know it was the backlight because:\n\n\n*\n\n*I have an external display, which remained on, and I could still see my desktop (so the computer hadn't turned off)\n\n*The windows that were on the internal display didn't move over to the external display, meaning that the internal display itself was still on, but just not illuminated\n\n\nAfter some experimentation, I discovered that I could get the backlight to turn back on by holding down F1 (to lower the brightness) until the brightness setting reached 0, then holding F2 (to raise the brightness) until it was back at 100%. It was as if the system didn't \"know\" that the backlight was off until I manually lowered the brightness to 0, and then it would know to turn it back on when I raised the brightness.\nHowever, after doing this, the backlight would only last for a few seconds at 100% and then it would turn off again.\nFinally, I tried raising the brightness slowly from 0, and was able to work my way back up to 100% without it turning off. It's been working since.\nIs this a hardware failure or a software glitch? I'm running OS X Mountain Lion (10.8.4) and the issue persisted through a reboot.\n\nA: The issue is caused by a burnt out soldering attaching a cable to an iron bar component situated in the lowest part of the screen. It is part of the module named 612-0035-a. It is the LCD inverter. It is not user solderable with standard equipment.\nThere's no need to buy an entire screen to fix this, just a new LCD inverter. To prevent same damage from happening again, it is recommended to brace from power surges.\n\nA: I was able to resolve the similar problem by resetting the PRAM on my MacBook. I followed the helpful article on The Next Web, which along with explaining the how, when & why of resetting PRAM and SMC also contains the instructions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your machine. Yes, all the way down, not sleep or logging out.\n\n\n*Press the power button and then press command-option-p-r. You have to make sure you get those keys pressed before the gray screen comes up or it won’t work.\n\n\n*Hold those keys down until your Mac reboots again and you here the startup chime.\n\n\n*Let go of the keys and let your Mac reboot normally.\n\n\nA: I'm sorry to tell you but I had the exact same issue on a 2008 MacBook White and it was never resolved. I went several times to different Apple Stores and they tried fixing it. Unfortunately, they always failed.\nFor me this scenario went on over a period of about 2 years. At the beginning it only happened rarely but got worse over time. Towards the end the MacBook was unusable without an external screen.\nI know my answer doesn't 'solve' the issue as such but I thought I'd share my experience and prepare you for what is ultimately unavoidable. As you say yourself, there are some tricks (like going up slowly in brightness letting not overheating parts) but they only worked temporarily for me.\n", "Q: Is it possible to configure the 2013 Airport Extreme to use a syslog server? I know it was (and still is) possible to configure the earlier Airport Extreme and Airport Express stations to forward syslog events to an external server.\nThe trick is to use AirPort Utility 5.6.1\nBut is it possible to do the same with the current (mid 2013) model? Will AirPort Utility 5.6.1 work with these models?\n\nA: Well, I bought one and tried.\nAirPort Utility 5.6.1 complains about incompatible hardware and missing parameters, but apart from that it works :) It's possible to configure the syslog server.\n\nA: Although this questions is nearly three years old, the Airport Utility limitations still exist. I did not want to roll back to 5.6, so I searched for another solution, which I found.\nThese are the basic steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*In Airport Utility, select the base station to configure, and click edit. \n\n*Then go to File, and export the configuration file.\n\n*Open the configuration file in a text editor, and search for the key slCl.\n\n*Edit the string field to match the IP address of the system logger.\n\n*You can also set the log level by adjusting the string for key slvl.\n\n*Finally, go to File again and import the configuration file to update the settings.\n\n\nKudos to Frits Hoogland and his blog \"How to make apple wifi routers do remote logging\".1\nRelated to this, please see my post on the details actually making it into the log: Airport Extreme firewall logging\n", "Q: Is office for the mac the only way I can open and save as word documents? When apple people interact with people who use MS word, is the only way to do this by purchasing Office for the Mac or can pages make do?\nI believe pages can output to a format that is word friendly correct?\n\nA: There are various solutions for dealing with Word documents on the Mac:\n\n\n*\n\n*Quick Look, built into all versions of OS X since Leopard, can preview Word documents. It doesn’t always get the formatting right, but it’s good for a quick inspection.\n\n*Pages, part of the iWork suite, can open (in .doc and .docx) and save (in .doc) Word documents. This isn’t perfect either. One useful feature is that it shows you a list of warnings when you open a document, highlighting Word features used in the document that aren’t supported in Pages. Pages costs $19.99 in the Mac App Store.\n\n*NeoOffice is an open-source port of OpenOffice to the Mac, which can open and save to a wide variety of formats, including Word documents. NeoOffice can be downloaded for free from their website.\nThere are a handful of other word processors on the Mac that can handle Microsoft Word documents (Nisus Writer Pro and Write both spring to mind), but I don’t have enough experience with any of them to say how good they are at handling Word’s formatting.\nIf you’re using advanced features of Word, or very complicated formatting, then your best experience will be using the native Microsoft apps. But for simple formatting, any of the apps I just mentioned will probably be sufficient. It really depends on what sort of documents you’re likely to be dealing with.\n\nA: TextEdit opens Words documents. Preview can show them.\n\nA: Pages and LibreOffice/OpenOffice/NeoOffice and others can open most Office documents.\nExcel can be opened by Numbers and numeric\n\nA: iWork Pages can export to .doc format. LibreOffice/OpenOffice can save to .docx. \nBut in both cases you will have compatibility problems when using some layouts or other functionnalities. \nSo if you want to work on the same documents I would strongly recommand MS Office Mac. It will save you a lot a times. \n", "Q: Found Virus Bloodhound.PDF.20 on the time machine external drive, how to remove Just got a bran-new work-issued macbookpro loaded with Symantec endpoint protection (not by choice), it's less than 2 weeks old.
