["Q: Can't boot into Recovery via Wired Windows keyboard, can't log in to accounts either I recently bought an iMac Mid 2011, and it has 3 accounts on it, all locked with passwords. I have an external Windows keyboard and external (wireless) mouse.\nI don't know the passwords so I thought I'd try to boot into Recovery, which I couldn't do. It just kept starting into the system.\nI tried different USB ports for the keyboard, I tried the far right and far left, I've tried literally every key combination, none of them work.\nHow the hell can I do this? I have a MacBook Pro but I'm not sure if you can turn it into a wired keyboard (sounds quite dumb).\n\nA: I think there is a delay before the keyboard starts, so when it shows you the white/gray screen, just hold Alt + Win Key + R for 2 seconds, then let go and instantly hold it again for 2 seconds.\nJust keep doing that until it doesn't boot into the OS and then you know it's doing something.\n", "Q: Dual boot MacBook Pro 14.1 w/ Mojave/Ubuntu 22.04 won't set permanently macOS as default boot option after each Ubuntu session I just installed Ubuntu 22.04 on a partition. I'd like macOS 10.14.6 to be the default system to boot and having the possibility to choose Ubuntu only if I hold option key to get into the Mac startup manager, but Ubuntu takes over as the default system every time after I log into it.  My first try was changing the boot order with sudo efibootmgr -o xxxx,xxxx, and the second one was entering the Mac startup manager by holding option, then select the macOS option by pressing ctrl while clicking on the ↑ icon under macOS boot device.  Both work on the immediate (I automatically log into macOS if I reboot from both systems) but the first time I boot Ubuntu one of the described actions need to be remade (boot order is reset and Ubuntu is first again), otherwise  if I reboot the computer, I need to get into the startup manager to not get automatically into Ubuntu.  How could I permanently set macOS as the default boot option independently from the last used OS?\n\nA: The Ubuntu installer places .efi files in the following folders on the hidden EFI partition. The MokManager is repeated with with the same filename and Secure Boot is repeated with different filenames.\n\n\n\n\nType\nFilenames inEFI/Ubuntu Folder\nFilenames inEFI/BOOT Folder\n\n\n\n\nGrub\ngrubx64.efi\n\n\n\nMokManager\nmmx64.efi\nmmx64.efi\n\n\nSecure Boot\nshimx64.efi\nBOOTX64.EFI\n\n\nFall Back\n\nfbx64.efi\n\n\n\n\nThe Mac Startup Manager only recognizes, as a boot option, the BOOTX64.EFI file in the EFI/BOOT folder. When selecting this option, the Secure Boot file will automatically make Ubuntu the default to boot.\n\nPossible Solution #1\nCopy the EFI/Ubuntu/grubx64.efi file to EFI/BOOT/BOOTX64.EFI file. This will cause the Mac Startup Manger to instruct the firmware to boot Grub instead of Secure Boot. Grub will not change the boot order.\n\nNote: A future update to Ubuntu may undo this change.\n\n\nPossbile Solution #2\nInstall and configure the rEFInd Boot Manager. (Preferable to the EFI/BOOT folder in a new EFI partition.)\nBelow are two possible ways to configure rEFInd.\n\n*\n\n*Always display a menu where the Grub installed with Ubuntu (or possibly just Ubuntu) could be chosen, but would by default always boot macOS after a short delay. In this case, you would make rEFInd the default to boot.\n\n\n*Do not display a menu and always boot the Grub installed with Ubuntu (or possibly just Ubuntu). In this case, you would make macOS the default to boot.\n", "Q: Change 'New Quick Note' keyboard shortcut How to change the shortcut fn+Q to create a quick note to another hotkey?\nMy Logitech K380 doesn't support fn+letters as valid hotkeys.\n\nA: You can set it in System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Mission Control (left pane) > Quick Note (last item in right pane).\n", "Q: Disk space arithmetic So I am trying to clean up my disk a little and ended up looking at the disk utility.\nCan someone explain this... \"thing\".

So available (80 below) is different from free (67)\nSeriously, I need help here...\nB\n\nA: It says 80GB available because 13GB of the data can be purged if necessary. However, it still exists, so it says 67GB is free in the top bar.\n15GB is used is the macOS “system” volume. The “other volumes\" includes your \"macOS – Data\", which are your docs/apps. The distinction is made so Apple can block (by default) editing of the macOS volume to secure apps from interfering with macOS (enforced by the signed-system volume and SIP).\nThe remaining 3 volumes are Preboot, Recovery, and VM. These do specific things and often take up very little space. For example, VM is swap space. It can often be 0B in an idling state. Swap is used when the OS removes data from RAM to the disk so the OS can better use your RAM.\nYou can list all volumes, without any being hidden, by using the diskutil list command line tool in a shell.\nCheck out this apple support page for more details.\n", "Q: Mac Studio Display audio is choppy I have one of the Mac Studio Displays with audio issues. The audio is choppy, cuts off, etc. Switching to alternative sound source works, but it's $1500 display and I expect it advertised six-speakers audio system to work.\nIs there any permanent fix or any fix to this issue yet that would not involved shutting down your system overnight?\n\nA: Apple released a firmware update (v15.5) that is supposed to fix the audio problems.\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213110\nYour Mac will reboot while the update is installed, but it's not 'overnight' -- it's a few minutes.\nIf you've already installed that, then I would take it back for a replacement unit.

This is quite strange as I see in almost every post, they suggest the firmware needs to read the BOOTx64.efi to detect the bootable system.\nI started diving into EFI partition because my Mac Mini 2018 did not show startup disk choices when I held down the Option key when starting, it just booted into macOS directly. But in macOS System Preferences -> Startup Disk, I can see my Windows BootCamp disk.\nAny light to shed on me?\n\nThe reason why my Mac did not respect my pressing on Option key has nothing to do with the bootx64.efi. It turned out to be the misbehavior  of my Logitech MX Keys. It never successfully sent the signal to Mac even though I was using the Unifying receiver. I changed to a cabled keyboard and everything worked fine.\n\nA: The macOS operating system looks at the files in the Windows partition to see if Windows is installed on your Mac. The macOS operating system does not look at the files in the EFI partition, as suggested by your question.\nThe full path, for the macOS boot file, is /System/Library/CoreServices/boot.efi.\nWhen using the Boot Camp Assistant to install Windows, a /Volumes/EFI/EFI/Boot/bootx64.efi file is created. This file is the same as the /Volumes/EFI/EFI/Microsoft/bootmgfw.efi file, which is also created when using the Boot Camp Assistant to install Windows.\n", "Q: How to remove list of Homebrew commands on every terminal start-up? This is more of an annoyance than something that actually affects my code, but I figured I'd ask about it in case someone else has found a solution.\nEvery time I start up my terminal, this long list of Homebrew commands populates, and it is just incredibly irritating.\nAny advice on how to stop this from populating every time i startup my terminal? I'm on a Mac if that matters.\nAny help or insight would be much appreciated. Thanks!\n\n\nA: So I did a bit of digging, and I found that the issue stemmed from my .zprofile file. With the new M1 macs, we are required to add a line of code to a file titled .zprofile when installing Homebrew by running the command below.\necho 'eval $(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)' >> /Users/$USER/.zprofile\neval $(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)\nAfter looking in my .zprofile file, I noticed several lines of the following code: eval \"$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew)\", which I believe is an older version that does not work with the new M1 macs. I must have typed that command in several times when it wasn't working because (again, after digging) I learned that the echo command adds a new line to the .zprofile file every time it's run. (Src: comments from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69422964/brew-command-line-mac-is-not-working-without-following-steps).\nTo solve the problem, I went into my .zprofile file in TextEdit and removed all of those extra lines of text. Now, when my terminal loads, it is clean!\n\nA: The shell in your case (which you can determine by typing echo $SHELL ) has startup files that are the most likely source of this. You may need some help editing that file for syntax errors as well.\nWorst case, you can search here for questions relating to dotfiles and your shell if that helps narrow down what this means for next steps for you.\nVery rarely, it can be startup commands for the application that you run to get to your shell.\n", "Q: Using WINE on Catalina / opening Freehand files I have a Mac updated to Catalina, on which I've installed Wine 1.8.6. I use Wine just to launch the legacy app Freehand (in a Windows version), to convert some old graphic files.\nHowever, I am surprised that many versions of Wine don't install on Catalina. v1.8.6 was the only one that I was able to install; and when I go to launch an .exe file,, Wine gives me an error:\n\nPrefix creation exited with error - You find a logfile to help with\ndebugging on your desktop.\n\nI don't know how to fix this problem. Anybody know a good and straightforward solution?\n\nA: Wine doesn't work on Catalina, because it uses 32-bit code, which is no longer allowed on MacOS.\nThere are other ways you can open old Freehand files. FH10 files can be opened in Preview and Affinity Designer. Alternatively, install Mojave on an external disk and boot to that; or run Mojave in a VM. Or find a friend with a Windows PC.\nYou could try CrossOver, which is another Windows emulator that works on Catalina. It is paid-for software, but there's a 14-day trial, which should be long enough to convert all your files. https://www.codeweavers.com/crossover\n", "Q: Transfer iCloud GCBD (China Mainland) data to iCloud global? Just like the title goes. No one wants GCBD.\nEvery article I found on the internet suggests that there are no way but to backup everything yourself, then create a new account and select region besides China Mainland, try to get all of those backup data back to your new account. However it is not only tedious but also poses a risk of losing part of the data (e.g. Live Photo, Device Backups).\nIs there really no way to transfer it more elegantly?\n\nA: No, there's really no other way of transferring the data than by taking a copy and re-uploading it.\nApple does not provide a service to transfer the data directly between the two regions.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro won't start up on Mondays EDIT:  Solved it... resetting the NVRAM did the trick.\nI have a 2018 MacBook Pro running macOS Catalina.

It's probably 'even more true' trying to go from Monterey back to Catalina. Catalina wants to see a Time Machine drive formatted as HFS+; Monterey uses APFS.\nCatalina will still be able to read the drive, but it won't be able to think of it as a Time Machine drive.\nYou will have to copy data manually.\nI'm unable to test this, but if it doesn't recognise it as a 'special' Time Machine drive, you will possibly be able to Get Info & 'Ignore ownership on this volume'. That will give you permissions to copy data from it like any other drive.\nWork from the folder in Backups.backupdb/[MacName]/Latest\nNote that database structures like Apple Mail will not be able to be used by the older OS; they will be incompatible.

Parallels Desktop keeps commenting lines which as it needs to connect to that domain. I tried changing access of /etc/hosts to 444 but it suddenly changed to 644.\nIt seems like Parallels Desktop needs to edit /etc/hosts to define hosts on its local network.\nHow can block access of Parallels Desktop from these domains without changing /etc/hosts?\n\nA: Configure Parallels Desktop to stop editing /etc/hosts\nYou don't mention which domains you are trying to block access to, but you can configure Parallels Desktop to stop fiddling with /etc/hosts, which will hopefully prevent this issue.\nAccording to this Parallels Knowledge Base article, you can prevent Parallels Desktop from updating /etc/hosts as follows:\n\n*\n\n*Open the /Library/Preferences/Parallels/network.desktop.xml file and locate the following line:\n<NATDAllowEtcHostsWrite>1</NATDAllowEtcHostsWrite>\n\n\n*Set the setting above to \"0\" (disabled) so that no records will be created in the /etc/hosts file.\nNote that turning this setting off won't let you access a VM by hostname. Instead, you will have to use its IP address, which can be inconvenient, for example when connecting with SSH to a VM.\nMore information\nIn Parallels Desktop Pro Edition a virtual machine's name will be automatically registered in the host's /etc/hosts records if the following statements are true:\n\n*\n\n*The VM is in Shared or Host-Only network mode;\n\n*and the VM gets an IP address from DHCP (not a static).\n\nFor example, say you have a VM named rhel6.3 which is in shared networking mode with the DHCP-assigned IP 10.211.55.4. When you start the VM, a new record will be created in /etc/hosts:\n10.211.55.4 rhel6.3 rhel6.3.shared #prl_hostonly shared \n\nNow, by using either the rhel6.3 or rhel6.3.shared name, this VM can be accessed from the host or any other VM in the shared networking group.\nUse firewall software\nAlternatively, if the above method doesn't work, you can block the domains by using a firewall software like Little Snitch (Little Snitch offers a free trial).\n", "Q: Make iPhone use speaker for calls when charging I have a few MagSafe charging stands (with phone vertically oriented), and I expected that iPhone would automatically pick speaker mode rather than assuming I'd be holding the phone against my ear.\nIs there a way to configure the iPhone to assume that when it's on the charging stand to always select Speaker when it's charging?\nUpdate: I already had Auto-Select Speaker in Call enabled which seems like it should do what I want automatically, but doesn't\n\nA: Although this may not entirely answer the question (in fact, maybe not at all) since it will probably not allow you to specify the kind of loudspeaker on the iPhone, I still want to share it since it may lead you to a solution that works for you anyway.\nIn the Shortcuts app, you can determine whether the iPhone is connected to a charger and then select a playback destination to iPhone, headphones, TVs, HomePods, etc.\n\n", "Q: Does macOS allow users to specify which monitor to enable Night Shift if a external monitor is connected?

I have a file with the name:\nthis is my app.ipa\nI'd like to rename this file:\nmv $(path)/this is my app.ipa $(path)/this_is_my_app.ipa \n\nDoes not seem right... Thanks in advance.\n\nA: You have to either escape the spaces:\nmv $(path)/this\\ is\\ my\\ app.ipa $(path)/this_is_my_app.ipa\n\nor use quote marks:\nmv \"$(path)/this is my app.ipa\" $(path)/this_is_my_app.ipa\n\n\nA: Depends on the shell.\nMost are enclose in quotes - either \" or ' - they do have different effects in expanding environment variables. POSIX shells don't expand ~\nso\nmv \"$(path)/this is my app.ipa\" $(path)/this_is_my_app.ipa \n\nPOSIX shells also allow escaping characters using \\\nmv $(path)/this\\ is\\ my\\ app.ipa $(path)/this_is_my_app.ipa \n\nAlso if there is only one file with a similar name use wildcards\ne.g.\nmv $(path)/this*.ipa $(path)/this_is_my_app.ipa \n\nor\nmv $(path)/this?is?my?app.ipa $(path)/this_is_my_app.ipa \n\n\nA: While you could precede each space with a \\ character, you would be better of enclosing the entire file name with a pair of double quotes\"\", as shown below. Here I assume path is  a variable, which also may contain spaces.\nmv \"$path/this is my app.ipa\" \"$path/this_is_my_app.ipa\"\n\nOr, a suppose you could also use the following.\nmv \"$path\"/this\\ is\\ my\\ app.ipa \"$path\"/this_is_my_app.ipa\n\nIf path is executable with output, then you are correct to use $(path).\n\nA: Other answers explain the various ways to enquote or escape spaces.  But as another option, tab-completion is your friend here and whenever you have filenames that are difficult to type — whether due to characters that need escaping, accented or otherwise unusual characters, or just length.\nSpecifically, if you start typing the command and current filename:\n   mv $(path)/thi\n\nand then press tab, your shell should automatically complete to the escaped filename:\n   mv $(path)/this\\ is\\ my\\ app.ipa\n\nafter which you can continue typing the command.  (If you have multiple files whose names begin the same way, tab-completion should complete the name as far as the first ambiguous character.)\n\nA: Here is a bit of a different approach which may be useful to you.\nThis following code will rename the file \"this is my app.ipa\", in the current working directory, to this \"this_is_my_app.ipa\"\nfor f in ./\"this is my app.ipa\" ;do echo \"$f\" |mv \"$f\" \"$(sed 's@ @_@g')\" ;done\n\nThis following version will rename all files, in the current working directory, ending with \".ipa\" which also contain spaces in the name... by replacing blank spaces with underscores.\nfor f in ./*.ipa ;do echo \"$f\" |mv \"$f\" \"$(sed 's@ @_@g')\" ;done\n\nThis following version will rename all files, in the current working directory, which contain spaces in the name... by replacing blank spaces with underscores.\nfor f in ./* ;do echo \"$f\" |mv \"$f\" \"$(sed 's@ @_@g')\" ;done\n\n\nA: Or you could type mv and a space then drag and drop the file into the terminal, it will add the full path of the file all properly escaped (and then you type another space and the new name)\nOr you could copy the path, then type mv and a space then ⌃-⌘-V (or in the menu: Edit → Paste Escaped Text) and another space and the new name.\n\nA: Use quotation marks when specifying long filenames or paths with spaces. For example, typing the copy c:\\my file name d:\\my new file name command at the command prompt results in the following error message: The system cannot find the file specified. The quotation marks must be used.\nRegards,\nPeter\n", "Q: Should I upgrade Mac OS El Capitan to High Sierra on Macbook white 7,1 mid-2010 (w/ 4GB RAM & SSD)? On the MacBook white 7,1 (mid-2010) the operating system can be upgraded this way:\nSnow Leopard 10.6.8 → El Capitan 10.11 → High Sierra 10.13\nI have no special reason for upgrading, apart from the fact that some web sites nowadays are poorly compatibly with outdated browsers, and also that old systems are possibly more vulnerable. The browser used is Firefox.\nI upgraded the MacBook mid-2010 to MacOS X El Capitan and cannot see performance issues with the following hardware : 4GB RAM, Core\n\n*\n\n*4GB RAM\n\n*2.4 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo Processor\n\n*NVIDIA GeForce 320M 256Mo\n\n*SSD 256GB (TLC NAND)\n\nI wonder if I should upgrade to High Sierra, or if this would involve a loss of performance. I think it should be ok but would appreciate any feedback from people with same kind of hardware components that did the upgrade to High Sierra.\n(N.B. I have a backup of Snow Leopard if necessary but would like avoid doing the job twice.)\n\nA: From the standpoint of having current browser support, consider the following.\nI have High Sierra installed on a 2011 iMac.  The version of Safari included with High Sierra is to old to work properly with may websites. In such cases, I have installed and use the current version of Microsoft Edge. The table below shows El Capitan and High Sierra support for the current version of some popular browsers.\n\n\n\n\nBrowser\nEl Capitan\nHigh Sierra\n\n\n\n\nSafari\nNo\nNo\n\n\nFireFox\nNo\nYes\n\n\nMicrosoft Edge\nNo\nYes\n\n\nChrome\nNo\nYes\n\n\n\n\nFrom this, I would conclude you should choose High Sierra over El Capitan. If you first upgrade to El Capitan, be sure to install all El Capitan software updates before upgrading to High Sierra.\nFYI, I have been using High Sierra for years and have never had to reinstall. My internal drive is the original HDD. This means I have High Sierra installed on a JHFS+ volume. Since you have a SSD, I would assume your High Sierra upgrade would be to a APFS volume. In other words, the installed would automatically convert your JHFS+ volume to APFS, unless you instruct the installer not to.\n\nA: This might get closed as 'opinion-based' but before it does… my opinion;)\nNot worth upgrading from El Capitan to High Sierra.\nBoth OSes are equally out of date compared to modern systems. Both will increasingly require workarounds to connect to the internet - which should really be avoided for either. Keep it offline as much as humanly possible.\nNeither will properly be able to interact with such as the App Store - which won't really matter much as neither will be able to use any new apps from it. You will be hard pushed to find any new apps that will support that far back - so long as your current old apps still work that's not an issue.\nSo, as either is an island in the stream, dropping further & further behind 'today', then the only important thing is how each behaves.\nEl Capitan was a really good, solid OS. Probably the pinnacle of the old OS X. The Sierras were an unmitigated disaster, saved eventually by Mojave… which you can't use without hacking - not recommended if you want performance & you can't hack it right up to a current OS anyway - so don't.\nHigh Sierra uses a poor early implementation of APFS which was very troublesome. Avoid.\nStick with El Cap.

You're going to want to try replacing the cable first as it is very easily accessible on your model (the cable running over the middle of your battery) & if that doesn't make a difference, replace the trackpad itself which you will need a T5 screwdriver for. Hope this helps.\n", "Q: Apple Watch app to trigger shell scripts on remote UNIX box I've finally switched from a Pebble Smartwatch to an Apple Watch, and I need a replacement for this app: https://store-beta.rebble.io/app/568a4cfa496916a93f00004e\n\nThe watch displays a list of shell scripts. I select one of them, and the script is run over SSH. It's a very fast way to trigger all sorts of actions in my home.\nIs there anything like this for the Apple Watch? I want something simple and minimilistic, and I do not want to rely on a third-party middleware service such as IFTTT.\nPaid apps are fine if they are available for one-time purchase (as opposed to by subscription only). Apps distributed only in source code form are fine as well, as I have an Apple Developer account.\n\nA: Yes, you can use an app such as sshRequester.\n", "Q: Apple Watch Web Browsing app I'm finding the Apple Watch to be surprisingly capable for browsing the web! If I send myself an iMessage with a link to nytimes.com, I can log in to my New York Times account, scroll through the homepage, and read full articles. Ditto for Amazon, and even social media websites like Twitter!\nThe only problem is, I really don't want to do my web browsing inside of the Messages app! If someone sends me a text, I can't read their message without closing out of the current web page. It's also confusing in the app switcher.\nAre there any Apple Watch apps which act as a simple wrapper for Apple's existing webkit implementation? I've seen Parrity, but that's not what I want—Parrity renders websites remotely and then provides a screenshot for the watch. I want to use the version of webkit that Apple built into WatchOS.\nIn the event that there's some sort of App Store policy against apps like this, I have an Apple Developer account which I can use for sideloading.\n\nA: Apple's WebKit-based web browser implementation on the Apple Watch is not available for third party developers to use in app.\nIf you yourself are a developer, you can just use WKWebView as a private API to render web pages in a side-loaded app. You cannot however distribute it on the App Store.\nA more practical and straightforward approach is to use the built-in browser that you have found inside the Messages app. The same is inside the Mail app, and you can also access it by searching the web with Siri.\n", "Q: How to move ( not copy ) photos from one album to another Within Photos, how to move a set of photos from one album\nto another one without copying them?\nLike you can move a file within the filesystem from one folder to another\nwithout copying it.\nI already tried many key combinations while dragging:\n⇧+drag, ^+drag, ⌥+drag, ⌘+drag\nwith no success.\nWhy does this basic function seem to be hidden or… missing?\nThe function of moving is much more needed in real life\nthan the one of copying.\nDoes this explain why so many users cry that they\ncannot organize their photos without exploding the duplicates number?\n\nA: Photos is not designed to work the way you are trying to use it. Photos creates a database with links to your files and any edits you make; it doesn't work with or show you the original source files.\nIf you want to work with files and folders, I recommend looking at other software. There are lots of solutions that use files and folders organize photos. Professional photographers often use solutions like this in conjunction with editing tools. For example, ApolloOne states as one of its major features that it \"does not use a database\". Xn View is another example. Google will give you many others.\n\nA: There does not appear to be a way to add a photo to one album and remove it from the first album in one action.\nYou'll have to add it to the new album, then remove it from the old album.\n", "Q: Using Apple Shortcuts app output I must be missing something with Apple Shortcuts.\nOnce you have a result, how can you get it written in the application you're using if it's not an application in Shortcuts catalogue ?\nLet's say for the sake of simplicity I want to use a shortcut that writes my name at the cursor location in my application\nAt some point I can finish the shortcuts \"program\" with\ncopy text to clipboard\nAt that point I only need to press cmd-V to get it done\nBut what if I want Shortcut to do it ?\nI can't figure it out\nI could maybe get an AppleScript to use system events to do it but this seems overkill.\nAny idea ?\n\nA: Given the answers received, I consider the topic closed.\nOn top of that, using an apple script is not as difficult as I imagined\nYou only need to add two shortcuts steps:\nGet Clipboard\nExecute AppleScript \n\nwith the corresponding script\non run {input, parameters}\n    tell application \"System Events\"\n        keystroke \"v\" using {command down}\n        return input\n    end tell\nend run\n\n", "Q: Why does my new iPhone Quick Start migration have 2 different iOS requirements? Old phone - iPhone 6S running iOS 11.0.3\nNew phone - iPhone 13\nWhen trying to do \"Quick Start\" on my new iPhone, the instructions say to bring an iPhone with at least iOS 11 near to the new iPhone.\n                                                                 \nI do that, but the transfer fails and says \"Transfer Not Supported.  Bring an iPhone running iOS 12.4 or later nearby to start transferring data.\"\n                                                          \nSo are the original instructions are wrong and iOS 11 is not sufficient, or is there something wrong with the transfer process?\n\nA: No, nothing is wrong and it’s almost always best to update each device as far as possible before starting the transfer.\nIn the case of a new phone, you can set it up new with no data and update or connect to a computer and restore it. For the existing phone, once you’re sure you have a good backup, update it all the way on the current version.\nOh, most importantly, congrats on the new phone - the 13 is a powerhouse and nice step up for your kit.\n", "Q: How to block, disable or otherwise prevent the playing of YouTube video ads on MacOS Safari? On iOS Safari, although not the most convenient, one may refresh the video whenever a video ad comes up at the beginning of the video, and that should pretty much do the job — the video starts immediately thereafter. In fact, one may simply start watching by immediately refreshing once the subaddress of the video starts loading. This bypass may or may not work on iPadOS.\nThe same, however, does not work on MacOS.\nHence, the question is what add-on, app, terminal code or other solution or work around is available to prevent the ad-disruption of YouTube videos?\n\nA: I use an app called Wipr to block ads on YouTube. It works for me both on macOS and on iOS (in Safari). It costs $1.99 as a one-time purchase.\nI believe there are free alternatives, but I've had the most luck with Wipr.\nHere's a screen recording showing before/after with Wipr: https://gfycat.com/mildanimatedlangur\n", "Q: Installing Java 19 on macOS 12.01 Monterey manually (without Homebrew) I would like to install Java 19 from Arm 64 Compressed Archive on my Mac running macOS 12.01 Monterey and Chip Apple M1 Pro without using Homebrew.\nI unzipped the file in the folder jdk-19.jdk to /usr/local.\nI changed the ownership as follows:\nsudo chown -R root:wheel /usr/local/jdk-19.jdk\nand/or:\nsudo chown -R joseluisbz:staff /usr/local/jdk-19.jdk\nand I was trying to give Terminal complete control over the disk using this tutorial.\n% ls -al /usr/local                                                                                                                                            \ntotal 0\ndrwxr-xr-x   7 root        wheel  224 Sep 27 20:12 .\ndrwxr-xr-x@ 11 root        wheel  352 Oct 17  2021 ..\ndrwxr-xr-x  15 root        wheel  480 Sep 27 22:19 bin\ndrwxr-xr-x   4 joseluisbz  staff  128 Dec 20  2021 include\ndrwxr-xr-x@  4 root        wheel  128 Sep 27 19:44 jdk-19.jdk\ndrwxr-xr-x   9 joseluisbz  staff  288 Mar 10  2022 lib\ndrwxr-xr-x   3 root        wheel   96 Mar  2  2022 share\n%\n\nWith nano I created ~/.zshenv using this tutorial with these contents:\n#export JAVA_HOME=$(/Users/joseluisbz/Downloads/jdk-19.jdk/Contents/Home)\n#export JAVA_HOME=$(/Applications/jdk-19.jdk/Contents/Home)\nexport JAVA_HOME=$(/usr/local/jdk-19.jdk/Contents/Home)\n\nBut, when I source the file, I get:\nsource ~/.zshenv\n/Users/joseluisbz/.zshenv:3: permission denied: /Applications/jdk-19.jdk/Contents/Home\n\n\n*\n\n*What am I doing wrong?\n\n*What other alternatives can I try?\n\nA: \nWhat am I doing wrong?\n\nWhen setting JAVA_HOME, you are using this notation: $(), which zsh interprets as command substitution: command substitution tells zsh to interpret the path within the brackets as a command, execute it, and return the result.\nIn the specific case of JAVA_HOME=$(/usr/local/jdk-19.jdk/Contents/Home), zsh tries to execute /Applications/jdk-19.jdk/Contents/Home, but since it is a directory and not an executable file, it fails and displays this error:\npermission denied: /Applications/jdk-19.jdk/Contents/Home\nTo fix the issue, in your file ~/.zshenv change from:\nexport JAVA_HOME=$(/usr/local/jdk-19.jdk/Contents/Home)\nto\nexport JAVA_HOME=/usr/local/jdk-19.jdk/Contents/Home\n", "Q: Switching to the first tab in Mail using Applescript or Shell I am looking for a way to switch to the first tab in a Mail window. It seems like there is no universal way to address tabs in macOS programmatically. I have tried Apple scripting with and without using \"System Events\", but with no luck. And most scripts on the net are regarding Safari.\nThese do not work:\ntell application \"System Events\" to tell process \"Mail\" to tell window 1 to tell radio button 1 to click\n\ntell window 1 of application \"Mail\" to set current tab to tab 1\n\nIt seems like Mail handles the tabs as if they were windows. But this does not help since the indexes of the windows/tabs shuffle around depending on how they are set up, whichever tab was selected last etc., and I always want to address tab #1 independent of the window index number and name/contents.\n\nI have traversed the Applescript Dictionary but cannot find anything suitable. Any hints would be appreciated. It would also be nice to know if it can be solved using Shell since I am going to use it for a Keyboard Maestro action.\n\nA: This is not optimal, but as a \"hack\", and if you do not rearrange the tabs after the initial setup, you can use the smallest id value to determine the first tab of Mail's window and do the switch. A thank you to CJK for the simplification of this script:\ntell application \"Mail\"\n    if (id of window index 2) < (id of window index 1) then set index of window index 2 to 1\nend tell\n\n", "Q: How to remove these message from intelliJ when I enter a new Terminal window?

The purpose of the script is to match each filename contained in the text file with a file in an input folder and move those files to one of eight output folders based on another field in the text file.\nMy problem is the filenames in the text file have .jpg extensions and the files in the input folder have been processed so they contain .png as the extension.

they can just be replaced when getting the name from the row.

I performed some tests, but you might want to use a smaller test set before turning it loose on production files.\n", "Q: How to change the default behaviour so that CMD + Tab brings the app on top? I have many apps.\nCMD + Tab is the fastest way to switch (me using keyboard only)\nBUT\nIt is rubbish because it does not bring the application on top.\nAfter some search, apparently this is a feature not a bug: Cmd+Tab switches to the correct space, but doesn't bring app up to front\n\nWhether it was intended as a feature or not, it is clearly a usability issue, aka a bug\n\nI just want to use CMD + Tab and bring the app on top by default (change the setting somewhere) rather than relying on a very tricky additional keypress.\n\nAnother related question: Bring all windows of active application to top\nOn my machine I don't have \"Bring All To Front\":\n\n\nA: Take a look at the answer on Cmd+Tab does not work on hidden or minimized windows.\nIt's incredible that Apple has to add so many features and none of them meets such a simple feature of use.\n", "Q: Progress indicator when copying local files on MacBook Pro is also visible on Mac Studio I am using a MacBook Pro and Mac Studio. Both devices are running macOS 12.5.1 Monterey.\nWhen I am copying files from one location to another on my MacBook Pro (both local to the MacBook Pro) the file copy progress appears on the MacBook Pro as expected, however, the progress also appears on my Mac Studio. I can cancel the progress indicator on the Mac Studio without impacting the copy progress on the MacBook Pro. Also, the copy progress indicator still persists on the MacBook Pro.\nI would like to disable this secondary indicator on the Mac Studio, but I'm not sure what mechanism causes this?\nI was thinking something to do with Handoff, but again I am unsure. Both are on the same local network.\nThis is a screen shot of what appears on my Mac Studio. Its the same progress indicator thats on the MacBook Pro.\n\n\nA: I believe @Ezekiel is correct in that this is the behavior of universal clip board. In the above scenario, the progress I am seeing is from Universal clip board copying the contents of my MacBook Pro's clip board to my Mac Studio's clip board. In this case, the files are multi gigabytes in size. This has the effect of impacting performance on my Mac Studio while this is copy is in process. My assumption is that is not really an issue for small files. Although I like the utility of universal clip board, I can not tolerate the impact in performance and will most likely disable this functionality on my Mac Studio.\n", "Q: What is AirPlayXPCHelper?

It's also the same .sys file: igdkmd64.sys every BSOD.\nI deleted the .sys file, and now when it boots, it'll show the Win 11 icon, then it fades out after a minute or so, then the screen goes black for another minute or so and then it restarts.\nI've gone into Safe Mode and opened Device Manager and now it shows the AMD Radeon driver installed but also shows the Intel display driver which I have deleted many times, which it might be using instead of the AMD one, but apart from that I don't why it's doing this when it's not in Safe Mode.\nI booted out of Safe Mode, and it let me into the Desktop for 1 minute before BSODing with the same .sys file. It must have reinstalled itself after I deleted it. However, it has just let me back into the Desktop without BSODing but for how long- and it BSODed when in the Desktop.\nAlright, in System Information > Display, it shows the IGDKMD64.SYS driver next to Driver but also shows Intel(R) HD Graphics! So, was it AMD? Let's have a closer look. Under the first listing (Intel HD Graphics), the second listing (AMD Graphics) shows \"Name\" - \"AMD Radeon HD 6700M Series\"?! What's going on?!! I have no clue.\nOn the Intel listing it says Resolution: Not Available, but on the AMD one it says 2560 x 1440 (1 hertz), which means it is using the AMD one but then switches to the Intel one (when out of Safe Mode) which results in the crash.\nI guess my theory below is correct! It shows the Driver for the AMD thing as \"ATIKMPAG.SYS\". But, even if I delete \"IGDKMD64.sys\" (for the Intel thing), \"IGDKMD64.sys\" comes back.\nMy theory is that it's switching between the AMD Driver and the Intel Driver, which then it crashes.\n\nA: I have an iMac (21.5-inch, Mid 2011) with 16 GB of memory. I have a triple boot of macOS High Sierra, Ubuntu Linux release 22.04 and Windows 10 version 21H1. I decided to reformat the Windows 10 volume and install the current Windows 11 release in this volume. Windows will remain BIOS booting, where as both macOS and Ubuntu will remain EFI booting.\n\nNote: Some actions given in the following procedure are not actually necessary to install Windows 11 on my Mac. These actions are included for others, who may adapt the procedure to their own particular needs.\n\nInstallation Procedure\n\nNote: I used a wired Apple keyboard and wired Logitech M110 mouse.\n\n\n*\n\n*Create an USB flash drive installer: Using macOS, I downloaded the following ISO file.\nWin11_22H2_English_x64v1.iso\n\nI also used the Boot Camp Assistant to download the Windows Support Software for this Mac. This should be the same as found at Boot Camp Support Software 5.1.5621. I copied the contents of both downloads to a MBR partitioned, ExFAT formatted USB flash drive, then renamed the file AutoUnattend.xml to NoAutoUnattend.xml. Below is a Windows 11 File Explorer view of the files and folders in the root folder of this flash drive.\n\n\n\n*Install a clean Windows 11 Pro from the flash drive: I started by UEFI booting from the USB flash drive. I proceeded with the installation until the window shown below appeared.\n\nNote: Reaching this window causes the drivers in the $WinPEDriver$ folder to be automatically loaded.\n\n\nNext, I selected the red button with the white X. In the popup, I selected the OK button. Next, I selected \"Repair your computer\", \"Troubleshoot\" and \"Command Prompt\", in the order given. This opened a Command Prompt window titled \"Administrator: X:\\windows\\SYSTEM32\\cmd.exe\". In this window, I entered the following commands. You may need to substitute different drive letters and index value.\ndiskpart\nlist volume\nselect volume c\nformat fs=ntfs label=BOOTCAMP quick\nactive\nexit\ndism /get-imageinfo /imagefile:d:\\sources\\install.wim\ndism /apply-image /imagefile:d:\\sources\\install.wim /index:6 /applydir:c:\\\ndism /image:c:\\ /add-driver /driver:d:\\$WinPEDriver$ /recurse /forceunsigned\nbcdboot c:\\windows /s c: /f bios\nbootsect /nt60 c: /mbr\nexit\n\nFinally, I selected \"Turn off your PC\" to shut down the Mac.\n\n\n*Install updates from the internet: First, I unplugged the ethernet cable from the Mac. From the Mac Startup Manager, I selected BIOS booting of Windows from the internal drive as the default. After booting to Windows 11 on the internal drive, I entered Audit Mode (by pressing the key combination  control+shift+F3). I installed the Windows Support Software (Boot Camp Support Software). When asked, I did not restart the Mac. Instead, I connected the Mac to the internet and opened the Apple Software Update application. I updated Apple Software Update before updating any other items. In my case, I needed to update Apple Software Update twice, then I installed the other updates, which included an update to Boot Camp. Afterwards, I restart the Mac. Finally, I installed all updates (including optional updates) offered by Windows Update. As you can see below, this included an AMD graphic driver update.\n\n\n\n*Setup the Mac for the Out-of-Box Experience (OOBE): From the the System Preparation Tool, select the options as shown below, then select the OK button.\n\n\n\n*Finish the installation: I turned on the Mac and followed the instructions. Among other tasks, this step created my user account.\nFinal Configuration\nThe information below came from the Windows 11 System Information application.\n\n\n\n\nItem\nValue\n\n\n\n\nOS Name\nMicrosoft Windows 11 Pro\n\n\nVersion\n10.0.22621 Build 22621\n\n\nSystem Manufacturer\nApple Inc.\n\n\nSystem Model\niMac12,1\n\n\nSystem Type\nx64-based PC\n\n\nSystem SKU\nUnsupported\n\n\nProcessor\nIntel(R) Core(TM) i5-2400S CPU @ 2.50GHz, 2501 Mhz, 4 Core(s), 4 Logical Processor(s)\n\n\nBIOS Version/Date\nApple Inc. 87.0.0.0.0, 6/14/2019\n\n\nSMBIOS Version\n2.4\n\n\nBIOS Mode\nLegacy\n\n\nSecure Boot State\nUnsupported\n\n\nPCR7 Configuration\nBinding Not Possible\n\n\nInstalled Physical Memory (RAM)\n16.0 GB\n\n\nTotal Physical Memory\n16.0 GB\n\n\nKernel DMA Protection\nOff\n\n\n\n\nThe images below show the use of AMD graphics.\n\n\n\n\nNote: I selected \"Enable AMD Video Quality in supported video player applications\", as shown below.\n\n\nActivation\nWindows 10 was activated before installing Windows 11.

The phone number is not linked to Apple ID I use on this iPad.

I thought it could access some device id and link it to my number in their servers on first launch, but the launch without internet connection still shows it.\n\nA: The information is stored in your Keychain. This information persists even when you delete the app and its data files.\nYou cannot see these entries when you look at Settings > Passwords. There's no Apple provided user interface for looking at or removing these entries from the Keychain.\nIf you want to get that information specifically removed, you'll need to use functionality from the maker of that social networking app. Apart from that you can of course erase the phone completely (Settings > General > Reset > Erase all content and settings), but that would also delete every other apps and their data. If you use iCloud Keychain syncing, you might need to clear that keychain as well.\n", "Q: SSL errors everytime I fetch or push from/to Github I've been having this issue the past few days and I don't know where the issue is coming from.\nWhen I try to brew update, or pull anything from git, I get this error:\n➜ brew update\nfatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/adoptopenjdk/homebrew-openjdk/': LibreSSL SSL_connect: SSL_ERROR_SYSCALL in connection to github.com:443\nfatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/': LibreSSL SSL_connect: SSL_ERROR_SYSCALL in connection to github.com:443\n...\n\nIn order to temporarily fix the issue, I need to reboot my computer.

For years we have been running everything on OS 10.14 without any issues. We recently updated our OS to 12.1. Many of the Applescripts are now broken. I've spent the better part of the day trying to get one that imports music files into Music (the script used to use iTunes), sets all the tags, and converts them to other file formats and found that many of the steps simply do not trigger seemingly from permissions issues. Changing:\nset newfile to (\"path to file\")\n\nto\nset newfile to alias (\"path to file\")\n\nfixed the ability to import the music track in. I also ran:\n-e 'tell application \"Music\" to activate'\n\nfrom Terminal to see if that would fix the permission, and and that did fix many of the steps if I run the script from the Script Editor. However, the scripts need to run from Filemaker. So, 1) is there a similar command I can run to allow FileMaker to run the scripts without issue (I tried adding Filemaker to the Privacy Pane - both Accessibility and Full Disk Access - but no luck), and 2) are there \"general\" best steps when upgrading Applescripts to work with OS 12?

Expecting one boot to recovery or a SMC to fix a flat battery isn’t realistic, but one run of these can help if the SMC isn’t charging or recognizing a battery.\nI would back up any data (boot them in target disk mode if you can’t trust time machine or do a manual backup) and then erase the storage completely. They all should work over internet recovery to ensure you get a total erase of the internal storage (or do the erase via target disk mode from another connected Mac that’s healthy).\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/erase-and-reinstall-macos-mh27903/mac\n\nNote, this is far easier on Monterey with the erase assistant, so if you can upgrade them to Monterey first, the erase will be easier for you.\nOnce you have a cleanly erased system, the battery health should be evident once they sleep for a day on power charge after the reinstall. Apple online support and service is excellent for verifying you just don’t need a battery swap due to them falling too low voltage in long term storage.\n\n*\n\n*https://www.apple.com/batteries/maximizing-performance/\n\n\n*\n\n*If you plan to store your device for longer than six months, charge it to 50% every six months.\n\n\n\nA: Possibly is the battery controller from MacOS bugged and not able to deal with a deeply discharged battery. Some battery controllers are not working correctly when the battery behaviour is outside the expected charge range. I have seen this many times, with computers and other devices as well.\nIn your case, from an USB flash drive, I would first attempt to boot the Mac to another operating system, typically a Linux live distro, with a graphical user interface. \"Live\" means you can run it without having to install it.\nOnce your flash drive is ready, plug it hold down the \"Alt\" key when starting the MacBook, and select the USB flash drive in order to boot the Linux system. Let see if the battery charges, and if so, let it charge fully.\nAlso make a few whole charge/discharge cycles if you can in order to revive your battery.\nIn the past, I experienced that the software battery controller in MacOS does not always work right.\nAlso, sometime, patience and persistence are your best allies. I have saved a deeply discharge battery pack by applying many \"charge / discharge\" cycles, which at the beginning were extremely short, but progressively with increasing duration. I had to apply around 15 cycles before the battery came out of its lethargy. So, keep hope.\n\nA: SMC symptoms\nThe battery doesn’t charge properly\nFans run at high speed any time the device is in use\nMachine’s (key board) backlight, status indicator light, or other lights do not turn on consistently\nBattery have onboard circuit that prevents it from been completely discharged\nIn order to perform an smc reset on a macbook you should first unplug your laptop and shut it down. Then hold down the Shift, Control, Option, and power keys for at least 10 seconds (or longer). Let go of the keys, plug the power cable back into your computer, and restart your computer as you usually would.\n\nA: SMC is separate from OS, it is a chip on the logic board.\nYour battery report shows a very old battery ? why I do not know.\nFull Charge Capacity (mAh):   4481 ??\nThat number for your Mac's should be > 7000\nMy MB Air is 5 years old and has battery CAPACITY of 5500\nWhile your Mac works on Power (no need to change the OS), first one should do a successful SMC reset. About that in my next post:\nOne is not clear to me: did you leave the Macs plugged in while in storage?\nThe reason I am asking is you have few actions that would consume battery over time.\nDarkWakeBackgroundTasks:  1\nPower Events:\nNext Scheduled Events:\nWAKE...\nWake on LAN:  Yes\n", "Q: How to merge container disk into the existing volume How can I merge the 300 GB Container disk5 with Container disk6 without losing data on disk6?

One would imagine this can be done by deleting disk5 and expanding the disk6 container. However this isn't possible, and it's due to the underlying physical partitioning structure and its sequence. A container disk is analogous to a physical partition.\n\nNote also that although you state EXTERNAL and TIME are the same size, they are sharing the free space in disk6. As TIME only reports a size of 933k, it leads me to think you may not have used it yet, which bodes well for the following procedure.\n\nBecause disk5 is sequenced before disk6 in the GPT, even if you were to delete disk5, you cannot extend the start point of a partition backwards to claim free space. If it were the other way round you could extend the end of the partition you keep into the free space to the end of the disk.\nA solution would depend on how much data you have already backed up in your Time Machine volume (see above), because I suspect that will need to be sacrificed to make this work. eg:\n\n*\n\n*Create an APFS volume EXT-COPY on disk5\n\n*Copy the data from EXTERNAL to this new volume EXT-COPY. This is possible because there is enough free space in disk5 (300GB free > 215GB used)\n\n*Delete EXTERNAL and TIME\n\n*Delete the container disk6\n\n*Extend the disk5 partition to use all the space\n\n*Create a new APFS volume TIME on disk5, and assign as your Time Machine device\n\n*Rename EXT-COPY to EXTERNAL\nBear in mind that you could copy any existing data from your TM backup to yet another external disk of comparable size, and then restore later. But it's not guaranteed that it would survive the process and that TM would use it. This is because TM backups are treated quite especially and are generally read-only. I have no experience on doing this but you might need to do a disk image copy. Perhaps someone else could provide guidance on that.\nNote, I have not tested this, but it might be worthwhile to setup a small scale equivalent partitioning structure on another external disk to thoroughly test my suggestion. It need not be very big, and doesn't need to contain much, if any, data. All you are testing is the workflow of managing the partitions.\n", "Q: Errors while attempting to install a Big Sur VM with Parallels 18 on Monterey 12.6 Looked at this question, but it seemed to be assuming Intel. All the other questions involved installing newer macOS than the Host. I couldn't find an Apple Silicon (M1) question installing older VMs.\nNote: I'm current running a Monterey VM just fine. I just need one running Big Sur.\nI used this command to create the VM:\n/Applications/Parallels\\ Desktop.app/Contents/MacOS/prl_macvm_create ~/Downloads/UniversalMac_11.6_20G165_Restore.ipsw ~/Parallels/macOS\\ Big\\ Sur.macvm --disksize 40000000000\n\nWhen I start this VM I get this error:\nCannot retrieve the hardware model data.\n\nThe .ipsw was downloaded from here.\n\nA: I found this Parallels Knowledge Base entry that clarified the way Apple Silicon (M1) VMs work in Parallels. From the link, I have my answer. Unfortunately, it can apparently not be done.\nLimitations\n\nTo run a macOS Monterey VM on Mac computers with Apple M series chips, Parallels Desktop 17 uses new technology introduced in macOS Monterey, that's why it is not possible to run earlier versions of macOS on a Mac with Apple M series chips.\n\nThe implication of this limitation is that you may not run Big Sur virtual machines at all on Apple Silicon.\n", "Q: How do I force Watch to record heart rate during a workout? When I record a workout using Watch, regardless of what app I use, including Apple's own Workout app, Watch almost always fails to capture the first 5-30 minutes of heart rate data. This (almost) only happens at the start of a workout, and it happens with 80-90% of workouts, regardless of the kind (cycling, walking, hiking, running, weights, pilates, etc.)\nHow do I force Watch to record heart rate during a workout?\n\nA: There are no settings for when to enable the use of the Heart Rate monitor on a Workout, neither in the Settings app on the Watch itself for Workouts, nor on the iPhone's Apple Watch app. Apple's Apple Watch User's Guide ( https://support.apple.com/guide/watch/start-a-workout-on-apple-watch-apd673ee7114/9.0/watchos/9.0 ) similarly states that you can simply \"Raise your wrist to see your […], […] heart rate.\", implying that you don't have to do anything, it'll just be there.\nThere are three possibilities I see here:\n\n*\n\n*A software bug.\n\n*A hardware failure causing sensor failure, or;\n\n*An impairment causing sensor failure. The only detail I've ever known for impeding the sensor is a tattoo. I don't know if other skin conditions would cause it.\n\nDoes the Heart Rate app return your heart rate within ~3 seconds of opening it? Do you have background heart rate measurements on and do they update at a steady rate? Does the ECG feature work?\n", "Q: How do you turn on write blocking to USBs on a Mac? I'm trying to capture a forensic image of a USB stick using Linux dd on my Macbook.  I'm having trouble turning on write blocking to the USB stick before taking the image.  In Windows you use a registry tweak to prevent writing on the USB stick- how do you do this on Mac (without spending money for a DLP solution)?\nIs this still valid to achieve that effect on MacOS, or did an update nullify it:\nsudo kextunload /System/Library/Extensions/IOUSBMassStorageClass.kext\n\nA: The command you quote has never been able to give the effect you want. That command disables USB mass storage class devices entirely - i.e. you wouldn't be able to read the device at all (nor would you be able to write to it). It wouldn't be useful when you want to capture a forensic image.\nInstead a way to go would be to stop the standard macOS automounter from mounting your USB stick as read/write. Then you could either mount it as read-only, or simply not mount it at all. Then you can take your forensic image.\nA simple way to do that is to install Disk Arbitrator, which is a freely available utility. Ensure that the icon indicates either green (block mounts entirely) or orange (mounts as read-only) before proceeding to plugging in the USB stick.\nIf you prefer a command line way of achieving something similar, you could disable auto mounting by this command:\nsudo launchctl unload /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.diskarbitrationd.plist\n\nRemember to test that this works with a test USB stick before using the real stick you want to create an image from.\nYou should be aware that this method is not \"fool-proof\". I.e. it will stop the system from auto-mounting the drive and contaminating it with Spotlight indices or similar. However, it does protect the USB stick from you doing stupid things. I.e. if you decide to use dd to write to the drive instead of reading from it, you will be able to do just that.\n", "Q: How to edit/delete/wipe iPhone (local) keychain items to stop Apps from identifying devices So it has not been news that some IOS developers use keychain items to track the uniqueness of devices through App reinstallation. Amazon is a huge one among them. What made my life particularly hard is that recently I migrated my old iPhone to a new one, but later decided to not erase the old one but to use both at the same time. And now all Amazon apps start to recognize both iPhones as the same device. So when I login my account on one device, the account on the other device would be logged out. And I can see only one entry on the amazon online portal for both devices. So the 'send to device' function of the kindle app won't work appropriately. There are also many other inconveniences due applications using keychain items for identification purposes, which I can't finish listing here, and for obvious reasons, none of the merchants could help us out in those situations on their end.\nSo the question is, are there anyway that we can somehow edit the local keychain items on the iPhone to stop (poorly designed) apps from mistreating different devices as the same one after system migration. Resetting or erasing the entire phone shouldn't be an option here.\nFinally I want to say that I can't believe a company as large as Amazon is still relying on some undocumented behaviors for such basic functionalities in 2022. Is it hard to realize the huge security risks behind it? What a poor IOS software engineering team they have assembled....\n\nA: As you rule out resetting and/or erasting the entire phone, then no - there's no way on the phone you can edit the local Keychain items for such \"poorly designed\" apps that do not themselves provide that feature.\n", "Q: Is it normal for an iPhone to remain in my devices list after logging out of Apple ID? I saw two iPhones that I used to own under the my devices list on the manage Apple ID site.\nI am sure that I signed out of apple ID on both the devices before I sold them.\nAfter you sign out of an Apple ID on an iOS device, it's supposed to disappear from the my devices list on the manage Apple ID website. You are also supposed to receive the \"Find my iPhone has been disabled\" email when you sign out of apple ID on an iOS device, I also checked my mail and I didn't receive the \"find my iPhone has been disabled\" e-mail that you get when signing out of an iOS device.\nNow this got me thinking that I might not have signed out of Apple ID before I sold the two of my iPhones, but I'm sure I did. I also want to add that I sold these two devices in the same month, but I sold the first one 3 weeks before the second one. Maybe this has some connection I don't know....\nHas anyone here had the same thing happen to them? Is it normal for an iOS device to remain on \"my devices list\" after signing out of Apple ID and is it normal to not receive the \"find my iPhone has been disabled\" e-mail?\n\nA: I've never had devices automatically remove from my Apple ID device list – I've always removed it manually.\nIf you've sold the device and it still appears on either your Find My or Apple ID device list, simply remove it and you'll be all set.\nUnless Find My iPhone is still updating the location, there is no cause for concern. If it is still updating, then perhaps it wasn't wiped properly.\n", "Q: Conversion script for Unicode combining characters? I have Greek text that used combining characters for all accented letters.  Some process that I was using with it converted these automatically to the single character equivalent.  This causes a problem for me in that I need the two versions to match in another app.  Or at least to sort into the same order.\nI can hunt for one at a time and use find/replace to fix that one, but this is rather tedious.\nIs there a simple way to convert all of them?  I can't do the original the way the second version was done, because they are different file types.\n\nA: Here are some options to convert all decomposed Unicode characters into their precomposed form. I'll assume that the files are encoded in UTF-8.\niconv\niconv is a character set conversion tool (based on the iconv codeset conversion functions). On macOS, it supports the \"UTF-8-MAC\" encoding for decomposed UTF-8 characters (see What the difference and usage of encodings UTF-8 and UTF-8-MAC in iconv?).\nUsage:\niconv -f UTF-8-MAC -t UTF-8 < decomposed.txt > composed.txt\n\nI found that iconv has problems with characters outside of the basic multilingual plane (emojis, flags, ...). As an example, it can not convert the characters  or . The following solutions do not have that problem.\nPerl\nA simple Perl script (found here on Stack Overflow) can convert decomposed to precomposed UTF-8:\n#!/usr/bin/perl\n\nuse Encode qw/decode_utf8 encode_utf8/;\nuse Unicode::Normalize;\n\nwhile (<>) {\n    print encode_utf8( NFC(decode_utf8 $_) );\n}\n\nUsage:\nperl compose.pl < decomposed.txt > composed.txt   \n\nPerl has also the -i option to modify a file “in situ”:\nperl -i compose.pl file.txt \n\nuconv\n(Found here on the Unix & Linux Stack Exchange.) uconv is not part of macOS, but can be installed from Homebrew (brew install icu4c) or Macports (port install icu).\nUsage:\nuconv -x any-nfc < decomposed.txt > composed.txt\n\nSwift\nIf you have Xcode installed on your computer then a simple Swift script does the trick:\n#!/usr/bin/swift\n\nimport Foundation\n\nwhile let line = readLine() {\n    print(line.precomposedStringWithCanonicalMapping)\n}\n\nUsage:\nswift compose.swift < decomposed.txt > composed.txt\n\n\nA: A MacOS app which can do these kinds of conversions is UnicodeChecker.

Initially, a blank file is created named \"newfile.tmp\", into which the full contents of the first .csv file is written.  The remaining .csv files are read in their entirety, and appended to \"newfile.tmp\" with the exception of their first lines (their headers).\nOnce the merge is complete, \"newfile.tmp\" is renamed to \"IC-Combined <suffix>.csv\", where <suffix> is obtained from one of the other .csv filenames and taken to be everything that appears after, but not including, the first space character.  If your example file name included the literal suffix, then the resulting file will be named \"IC-Combined YYYY-YBPoseExport.CSV\" (although you really should keep your file extensions lowercase, otherwise it can be problematic in application (including the shell) that enumerates files and performs searches on file names on a case-sensitive basis, which is pretty standard on UNIX-like systems).\nFinally, the file is revealed in Finder, which will coincide with its renaming.\nTo invoke the handler, here's an example:\nmergeCSVFiles at \"/Users/CK/Documents/Some Folder\"\n\nIt returns no value.\n", "Q: Apple Numbers : remove rows with blank cells I have a tables with some rows with empty cells. I want to remove those rows.\nIn Excel I can use the \"Go To...\" command to select blank cells and then i can delete the rows manually. (see this youtube video : https://youtu.be/juNiyixq_oA )\nIs there an equivalent way to do it in Numbers ?\nThanks.\n\nA: A directly similar method does not exist in Numbers.\nHowever, you can filter out any row with an empty cell in a table creating a filter using the Organize->Filter sidebar window.\nOnce you get there, choose \"Add a Filter\" and the name of the column with the empty cells and then, deselect \"Blank\" in the Quick Filter to appear. The rows corresponding to the empty cells in that column will disappear. You can then copy and paste the contents of the table to a new table and Numbers will only paste the visible cells from the filtered out table.\nIf there is more than one column with empty cells with the empty cells being in different rows in different columns and you wish to filter out all such rows, create a filter rule for each column in the Organize->Filter sidebar window and choose the \"Match All Filters\" option in the drop down menu at the top of the sidebar window.\n", "Q: Share Menu extension to Copy to Clipboard Is there an app or a script that can be added to macOS System Preferences > Extention > Share Menu\n\nSo you can use the Share Menu to copy to macOS Clipboard?\n\nIt would be very helpful when the shortcut Cmd+C is not working, for example, when you are creating a screenshot with Shift+Cmd+4.

To run a command with su, use the -c option with the entire command as a single string:\nsu otheruser -c 'ls -d /tmp'\n\n(The arguments after the username are actually passed to the other user's login shell as arguments, but pretty much all shells understand -c as meaning \"here's a command string to run\".)\nAlternately, you could do pretty much the same thing with sudo:\nsudo -u otheruser ls -d /tmp\n\nNote that su will ask for the password of the account you're switching to, while sudo will ask for the password of the account you're switching from (and also verify that you're authorized to run that command as that other user in the /etc/sudoers file).\n", "Q: What jailbreak tweak will list only the songs of an artist or in an album I liked or hide all that I failed to like in Spotify? There is a junkyard bunch of your “liked” songs in Spotify, but what good is that if you can’t listen to, say, all your Michael Jackson records you liked!?\nThere is even a fake “liked songs” button which, oops, by mere happenstance is named the same as the liked songs (the thousands songs junkyard of yours) that you actually liked. That fake liked songs button inside any artist will show basically popular songs of that artist, songs that are generally liked but you may have never even heard of let alone liked or like.\nThere is no “[my] liked songs” or “[my] liked albums” within which you would also be able to list “[your] liked songs” and the same is true for artists.\nWe need “list liked” button inside every category, or a “hide [those not yet] liked”.\nIs there a jailbreak tweak to achieve either or both of these on iOS 14.3?\n\nA: One well hidden feature of the latest version as of October 3, 2022 is that one, instead of tapping on the search magnifier in Liked Songs I’m on the Home Screen, pulls down the screen and punched in the album title or the name of the artist.\nIt is easy to overlook and gravely misleading since who would think one can activate two different search bars in one iOS screen with greatly different scope of search.\nThis method allows that you have the songs listed out that meet the criteria entered (word of artist name or album name) in the order added to your songs.\nCons\n\n*\n\n*you can’t listen to a streak of songs in an album you liked m in the order they appear in an album unless you liked them in that order;\n\n\n*you can’t listen to songs by a single artist across multiple albums let alone in their order they appear in their respective album unless you added them in that order;\n\n\n*it takes some getting used to if you are tired or your attention is divided to find it even after you learned about it’s existence as it is highly counter intuitive and well hidden;\n\n\n*you can’t simply reorder the songs in an album by unliking them and reliking them immediately as unliking them would make them disappear from the production upon the query word — you need to go into the album you wish to reorganize, unlike all songs and relive them;\n\n\n*There are no quick reorder buttons based on genre (when an album or artist is associated with more than one), year, mood etc. as this is basically a work around half-measure left there possibly to diffuse bad press or antitrust law reasons; and\n\n\n*Not the tweak one is hoping for reading this question.\nPros\n\n*\n\n*still better than absolutely not being able to listen to songs of your own liked songs listed by artist or album, have to create playlist thereof, or hide those you don’t like - it’s still all-in-all crap.\n\n", "Q: 2019 T2 I9 MacBookPro - linux boot external drive I have a triple boot set up on T2 Macbook Pro.\nmacOS, Windows 10, Arch Linux boot off of the internal NVMe drive, which works fine.

I have this folder structure:\nPhotos\n|- Bangalore\n|- Sydney\n|- Videos\n\nHow do I search in Photos excluding the Videos subfolder?\nI don't want to permanently exclude the subfolder from Spotlight, just for this particular search.\n\nA: Based on the directory structure in your example and assuming you wish to search for the files whose extension, for example, includes the keyword mpv under the Photos directory or any of its subdirectories, but not the Videos directory right under it, you can use the find command through the Terminal app as follows:\nfind . -name \"*.*mpv*\" -o -path ./Videos -prune\n\nThe command above assumes you are in the Photos directory in the Terminal app as you issue this command.\nIf you wish to search for the files whose extensions include either the keyword mpv or just avi with other criteria being the same as above, you can use the following find command:\nfind . \\( -name \"*.*mpv*\" -o -name \"*.avi\" \\) -o -path ./Videos -prune\n\nYou can search for as many extensions as you like at the same time using find by adding more keywords in between \\( and \\) as shown above. -o serves as the logical operator OR.\n", "Q: Can I group Spotlight results by folder?

Here is an example:\n\nIf you look at the \"Locations\" section in the left hand pane, you will see an answer to your other question about excluding folders.\nI am a paid user of HoudahSpot.\n\nA: Not sure if this is possible with the Finder. However, per your request and other specifications in your comment to your question, here is how it can be done using the find command in the Terminal app.\nIn order to search the current directory and the directories below in the Terminal app for the files whose extensions do not consist of, for example, either mp4 or avi, the following command should do the trick:\nfind -s . -type f \\! \\( -name \"*.mp4\" -o -name \"*.avi\" \\)\n\n-s makes find search the files and folders in alphabetical order, -type f makes it search only for files (not folders), and \\! serves as the logical operator NOT that makes find exclude the files that meet the given criteria.\nYou can include as many extensions as you like in between \\( and \\) as shown above so that the files with those extensions are also excluded from the output. -o serves as the logical operator OR.\nAs I said in my comment to your OP, the output of the above command will come out automatically sorted by the path and file names combined, which means the files will be sorted by their respective paths first, and, within each path, by their names. The output will show the respective path and name of each file together.\n", "Q: How to re-order the \"Look Up\" button when holding to select text?

Let's say I put all my C codes and the executables in ~/anta40/Codes/C.\nRemoving all the C codes via Terminal is easy:\nrm *.c\n\nMy question is how to remove all Mach-O executables (from compiling the C codes). On Windows this is very easy, because executables usually have exe extension, so you simply do:\ndel *.exe\n\nI think this is trickier on MacOS because the executables typically don't have specific extension. file may be useful, e.g:\n$ file sortdemo\nsortdemo: Mach-O 64-bit executable x86_64\n\nNo idea about the rest.\n\nA: Assuming no filenames with whitespace or other „funny“ characters, something like\nrm -i $(file * | grep Mach-O | cut -d : -f 1)\n\nshould do the trick.\nPS: rm -i will prompt you for each file. If you are sure that only the correct files get selected you can remove the -i.\n\nA: As this is specifically about C code and the executables derived therefrom, I just want to add that usually this is handled by your build tool.\nOne of the most popular build tools for C code is the make program. Commonly you would write the command make to create the executables, and make clean to remove them and other generated files afterwards.\nSo instead of manually deleting Mach-O files (which might in some cases delete more or less than what you wanted), I would recommend using a build tool.\n", "Q: Is it possible to change the display name in Finder Favourites?

The Dell monitor is charging it and it's always at 100% now.\nIs there a way to bypass this and charge my MBP separately ?\n\nA: There's no need to bypass this and stop it from charging. There's really no practical benefit to stopping charging at 98% every time. The positive effect for the life time of the battery is so very, very small.\nIf you still want to do it, then consider connecting your your MacBook Pro to the monitor via a cable that does not support charging. That could be for example using an USB-C to HDMI cable.\nPlease keep in mind though that your monitor has a built-in camera, speakers, ethernet, hotkey button, etc. These features will not work over a HDMI cable, but require USB connectivity. Instead of connecting the USB-C to USB-C cable to the monitor's USB-C port, you'll then need to have a cable that connect to the monitor's USB-B port.\nThere's no software available to the user in macOS that allows you to stop charging over USB-C from the monitor by way of GUI or command line. If you have an Intel MacBook Pro, you could try the third party software Charge Limiter for setting a maximum charge percentage.\n", "Q: Delete all duplicate files I have accidentally imported images from an app twice, resulting in list which repeats this pattern:\nfilename1.ext\nfilename1 2.ext\nfilename2.ext\nfilename2 2.ext\n\nabout 5,000 times.\nAll details (creation date, mod date, etc) match, except for the \" 2\" right before the extension.\nI can delete these manually, but I don't think anyone would consider this a likeable task.\nCan anyone please recommend a method – perhaps a Terminal code – which would delete all off the \" 2\" items in one fell swoop?\nNote that the items and their duplicates are restricted to a single folder.\nThere's an obvious pattern here (\" 2.ext\") but I have no idea how to use it.\n\nA: In Terminal, rm *\\ 2.ext should work.\nPS: To be sure that the correct files get deleted, run ls *\\ 2.ext first, or use rm -i *\\ 2.ext to be prompted for each file.\n\nA: nohillside's answer to use rm *\\ 2.ext will work just fine, but if you want extra confidence it's doing the right thing, you can instead use\nmkdir to_be_deleted\nmv -- *\\ 2.ext to_be_deleted\n\nThat'll put all the files you want deleted in a separate folder - you can then use finder (or whatever) to check which files are still in the original folder, and which ones have been moved.

You could theoretically avoid those by copying the folder and trying it first, but the only way to totally verify is if you went through them by hand which somewhat defeats the purpose.\nThis is a Python file I use for similar deduplication that I might have. It scans the folder for files by using their sha256, retains the highest file name alphabetically (which should generally keep the cleaner file names) and deletes the others.  You can change the dry_run variable on the 3rd to last line to true like this:\nif __name__ == '__main__':\nd = Deduplicator(path, dry_run=True)\nd.deduplicate()\n\nTo verify that the files you want to delete are actually what are going to be deleted. And, of course, change line 4 from /path/to/your/files to the actual directory where the files are.\nTo run, on a mac you should simply be able to run:\npython /path/to/your/deduplicate.py\n\nWhere /path/to/your/script is wherever you save this .py file.

At the beginning I thought it was some information the iPhone displayed on screen when the phone was put on Lost mode (which we did), but we just saw some images online and it seems all it shows is a message like \"This phone is lost, please call 123-45...\"\nSo, we are very worried about this and the true intentions of this person.\nCould anyone please help me understand how did they get our iCloud email address? Did they just unblocked my wife's phone? Should we be more worried?\nThanks!\n\nA: The Lost Mode message is whatever you typed at the time. There's no fixed format, just a suggestion.\nIf you only have one phone number, but access to your email from elsewhere, then it would make sense to add your email address.\nI guess it's a case of trying to remember exactly what message you put in there.\nI actually have my partner's phone number embedded in my lock screen picture - but that's more for emergency than if I lose it. At the scene of an accident, even in the hands of someone who has no idea how to access the emergency mode on an iPhone, they can immediately see an ICE contact just by lifting the phone to wake the screen.\nApple KB - Mark a device as lost in Find My on iPhone\n", "Q: microphone and cable headset do not work in any app even though the micro is allowed under \"Privacy\" --> \"Microphone\" Taking up for example the answer of Microphone not working on third party apps only (iPhone 6):\n\nUnder Settings > Privacy > Microphone you'll be able to allow/deny each app that require the microphone to use it.\n\nI do not see any apps in the list. I only see one item called \"App Clips\", and in that item, nothing is listed. How can I get back all of the apps that need the microphone?\nUPDATE 221016:\nI see the allowed microphone for two messengers now, WhatsApp and Threema, after having agreed to share the microphone. They were not allowed anymore after resetting the iPhone settings to the default. But on the other hand, I did that reset only to get the microphone back, therefore, this cannot be the problem, the problem was there before. I could not find a way to allow the microphone for voice memos or calls, but that is likely just not needed.\n\nThe microphone is missing everywhere:\n\n*\n\n*filming with front or back camera,\n\n*voice memos: you cannot even start the record,\n\n*speech-to-text in Whatsapp, Telegram, Signal, Threema, Notes and just everywhere else,\n\n*Siri,\n\n*phone calls with or without headset.\n\nThe Apple headset itself does not work either: plugging it in and out does not lead to any change in the played media, it will just use the loudspeaker at any time.\nThis is just a list of examples that I tried, it is clear that it does not work anywhere else.\nI have an iPhone 7 with iOS 15.7.\n\nA: Workaround found at least.\nWhen I connect with a Bluetooth headset, I can sometimes speak on a voice memo, or I can use the microphone in a messenger call, but only seldomly. I have to call people roughly 10 times over some range of time until one call might work. And if it works, and if you start right away with another test in the same or another app, it does not work again. I found out that the call often does not even get out in Whatsapp or normal call, saying \"unable to initiate call, please try again\". And you normally do not even hear the ring tone when calling someone, and then, the microphone will not work either or comes in only after 30s, and you cannot say why and did not do anything on both sides for this. You cannot plan it. I could not take any call up to now, it worked only in times when I called out. And all of this with the Bluetooth headset only.\nAfter switching Bluetooth off again, I still cannot use my headset or speak on the microphone without headset, therefore, it cannot come just from a broken headset. I guess that the driver for the microphone is set off and that a full new install of the phone would solve this, but I do not want to install everything again.\n", "Q: ps_mem alternatives for Mac? ps_mem is an utility to accurately report the in core memory usage for a program.

The whole purpose of the Fusion Drive is to mix the speed of an SSD with the storage size of the HDD.\nHowever: your iMac is now 5 years old, and the average lifespan of a hard drive is ... 5 years! There is a high chance that the internal HDD will fail at some point soon. If you make a Fusion drive, and the hard drive part fails, then the whole format will be 'broken' -- the SSD portion will be completely blank (until you re-partition it).\nIn short, I would recommend getting a USB 3 high speed external SSD, and abandoning the internal drives.\n", "Q: Is there a way to 'see under the hood' of a file without having to open it in program that supports it?

If the file is JSON or XML, for example, it will be readable with the built in TextEdit program.\nIf the application is a binary format, you will need a hex editor.

I'd appreciate an answer specifically for the latest Apple MacBook models, for example those with the M1-M2 processors (yet it's also interesting for Intel models).\nI can learn from this answer (from 2018) that there's a battery usage, but not sure if it is for the case of 100%-charged one, and also if it's actual for 2022 models and USB-C.\nSecond, as you know, we can connect electronic devices (eg smartphone, USB fan, etc.) to the USB-C ports of the MacBook and the laptop will charge those devices. When the laptop itself is connected to the home electrical outlet, will the charging of these devices be carried out through the battery (thus potentially causing wear and tear) or does the motherboard transfer the current directly to these devices and skip the battery? Whether the battery is full or not\nP.S. Note, the main goal of this question for me is to know if there is degradation to the battery health if I charge my iPhone through the laptop, or on a daily basis there is probably no significant difference if I charge it directly to the household electricity, compared to charging through the laptop which is physically more convenient for me. However, I would appreciate a direct answer to the questions above just as I asked them\n\nA: To be fair, you ask several questions in one thread, which might create reference problems later.  I see you are new, so I will answer your question; however, one suggestion for the future is, please post separate questions in separate threads.\n\nif when the MacBook is connected to the household electricity with charger, there is still wear-and-tear on the battery, even if it's fully charged?\n\nYes.  But the wear-and-tear comes not from the power adapter supplying power to the battery, but from the fact that the battery is 100% charged.  The more charged a battery is, the faster it wears out.  For people concerned with battery longevity, there are computers that stay charged at around 60%, with the possibility of pushing a button to charge to 100% when you anticipate needing that extra charge somewhere.\nWhat I do to avoid wear-and-tear on the battery is, to get the battery discharged to ~15%, and then use a non-PD charger (PD = Power Delivery, a USB standard that Apple uses to charge).  The non-PD charger keeps the MacBook running without charging the battery; as such, my battery is almost 12 years old, and still running strong.\nAlso, there is a question Can I tell my Mac to charge to 80% only? that details other, more automated ways to avoid having the battery charged to 100%.\n\nIf, for example, the battery was completely broken or non-existent, could the laptop still work with a direct connection to electricity (so receiving the electric current from charger and not from battery)?\n\nSince you're asking only about the latest models, yes.  But there has to be smart circuitry that internally disconnects the battery; in sufficiently old models this is not possible.\n\nwill the charging of these devices be carried out through the battery (thus potentially causing wear and tear)\n\nThe answer is No.  This is due actually not to the Motherboard transferring the current to the devices, but rather this is a direct electrical principle, that electricity flows down the path of the least resistance.  So if there is a device connected to any laptop, the electricity will flow down to this device before even reaching the battery.  (The only exception is if your computer and charging consumptions use more watts than the adapter provides -- but this should only happen if you are using a weak non-standard charger).\nP.S.

Do you need to allow kernel extensions to use  Samsung t7 hardware on a Macbook pro-M1 13-inch?\n\nA: You only need to change the Security Policy to \"Allow user management of kernel extensions from identified developers.\" if you want to use Samsung's own encryption / lock and management app. It is a prerequisite of its install / use.\nThe install process is a bit wayward, even so that Samsung provided an extra document for a workaround when installing in macOS. Find it at https://s3.ap-northeast-2.amazonaws.com/global.semi.static/Troubleshooting%20Guide%20for%20macOS%20Compatibility_Rev.1.1.pdf\nThe only benefit it might have provided me was to be able to update the T7 firmware. Other than that, macOS FileVault provides adequate security for me. The lock facility might be useful to you though, as while FileVault prevents someone having access to your data, a lock would prevent them from reformatting and reusing the SSD without a care for the data.\nAll that said, the T7 has been a reliable and fast target disk for Time Machine for me. I ended up just using it as-is without the Samsung software.\n", "Q: When I have a new iPhone, can I unlink the old one from my iCloud identity? I got the new iPhone 14 Pro and was wondering if I can unlink my old iPhone from my identity, while still keeping iCloud activated on the device.\n\n*\n\n*For example, a contact tried to send me some photos via AirDrop, but selecting my Contact picture wouldn't work, instead they had to choose the device separately.\n\n*Another example is my alarm clock. Each day, the alarm goes off on both phones, so I need to turn the old one off each evening.\n\nI would like to keep iCloud active on the old phone if possible, as I use it as a backup device, so connectivity with my Cloud service is much appreciated.\nDoes anyone of you know how I can achieve this ideally without turning off iCloud for both phones?\n\nA: \nI got the new iPhone 14 Pro and was wondering if I can unlink my old\niPhone from my identity, while still keeping iCloud activated on the\ndevice.\n\nIn general, this isn't possible and shouldn't be necessary. You either stay signed in, or you sign out.\n\nFor example, a contact tried to send me some photos via AirDrop, but\nselecting my Contact picture wouldn't work, instead they had to choose\nthe device separately.\n\nThis could be due to something that hasn't propagated yet, usually selecting a Contact picture appears on all signed in devices and goes to the first one that accepts it.\n\nAnother example would be my alarm clock. Each\nday, the alarm goes off on both phones, so I need to turn the old one off each evening.\n\nYou need to delete your alarm from the old phone.\n\nAlso, can I safely delete it from my device list in\n\"Find my\"?\n\nYou should do this if you plan on selling the phone. There's no reason to do this if you're keeping the device.\nTo avoid Find My left behind notifications, open Find My and select the device. You can disable \"Notify When Left Behind\" on this screen.\n\nA: 1st possible solution: On the new phone you can go to Settings, click on your photo (AppleID), and there you'll see a list with devices that are logged-on with your AppleID. Then you can remove a device from your account.\n2nd possible solution: On a computer go to https://www.icloud.com/settings/ and Log-in with your credentials. Find \"Devices\" and click on any of the listed. There will appear a list, and you can delete any of them from it.\nThen the old phone will be disconnected from your iCloud account but all files on it will remain on the device. Then you can make a new Apple ID, to use with your old phone, for example \"iPhone11Pro.myAppleID@iCloud.com\" and activate it on your old phone. If at some point you need to access your 1st iCloud on you old phone, you can log-in with your 1st AppleID.\nI think that alarms are part of the \"Reminders\", which are kept on iCloud. Having two different AppleID's for the two phones is the way to make different settings on them.\n", "Q: Does MacOS automatically update System Drivers? Does MacOS automatically update System Drivers? If so, how do I check if they're up to date?\n\nA: If you're on the latest OS, you'll have the latest drivers. You can't generally download and update them separately. And how much they vary between OSes is generally an unknown quantity.\nApple make the software and the hardware, so there's a smaller pool of devices to drive, and they've either written it themselves or licensed code from Qualcom, Intel or AMD, with any alterations they make on top. Either way, it all just goes into the OS.\nIn over 25 years of using Macs, I can't recall an occasion where a problem was caused by someone not having up-to-date Apple-supplied drivers.

[stuff] to tell find to search in the current directory: find requires the path to search as an argument. Then [stuff] should also be modified: the documentation for find says\n -E      Interpret regular expressions followed by -regex and -iregex\n         primaries as extended (modern) regular expressions...\n\nSo you need to include -regex. Then it says\n -regex pattern\n         True if the whole path of the file matches pattern using regular\n         expression.  To match a file named \"./foo/xyzzy\", you can use the\n         regular expression \".*/[xyz]*\" or \".*/foo/.*\", but not \"xyzzy\" or\n         \"/foo/\".\n\nSo ^i will not match anything: the paths will be of the form ./iCloud... So you could do find -E . -regex \"./iC.*\". If you have lots of directories and subdirectories — for example, if you're doing this from your home directory, with Library, Music, Pictures, and other directories with lots of entries, you might also want to add -maxdepth 1 to prevent the search from going into those directories.\n", "Q: Automator - Cyrillic symbols and file writing I was quite surprised the fact that Apple Automator can make backups for my notes.

Therefore, change this line:\napp.write(text, { to: openedFile, startingAt: app.getEof(openedFile) })\n\nto this:\napp.write(text, { to: openedFile, startingAt: app.getEof(openedFile),\n                  as: \"utf8\" });\n\nWhen reading in from the file, make sure it also gets read in as \"utf8\".\n\nSome JS notes:\n\n*\n\n*The line notesApp.includeStandardAdditions = true; isn't doing anything, so you can remove this.\n\n\n*Terminate your lines with semicolons, which you've done with three of them, but neglected the rest.\n\n\n*All occurrences of var that appear inside a function can (and should) be changed to let.  This limits the scope of the variable to the block in which the variable is declared, whereas var creates a globally-scoped variable, which is almost never advisable.\n\n\n*All occurrences of var that appear outside a function can be changed to const, since they're constants, which won't have their values changed at any point.\n", "Q: Are there SFTP command-line tool for macOS that have history or auto complete? Is there software for macOS that adds command history, autocompletion or other features to an ftp command line client?\n\nA: FTP and SFTP are completely different protocols. There is software that supports both, but it's just a common interface over two completely different things under the hood.\nSFTP\nSSHFS\nThe best way to use SFTP is via sshfs, which makes any SFTP server available as a networked filesystem. You can then use ordinary shell commands (with the shell's history and completion) to access remote files.\nmkdir myserver\nsshfs myserver.example.com:/path/to/root example.com\nls myserver/subdir\ncp myserver/subdir/myfile.txt ~\n…\nfusermount -u myserver\n\nThe sshfs software itself is easily available from package repositories such as Brew. The problem with sshfs is that it requires a kernel extension for FUSE, which is fine on Intel Macs, but a pain on Apple Silicon due to the extra kernel integrity protections.\nImproving the basic sftp command\nYou can use rlwrap to give any line-oriented command line software bash-like line editing commands, history, and completion of (local) file names. rlwrap is available from many package repositories including Brew.\nFTP\nzftp\nMacOS comes with a convenient command line FTP client: it's built into zsh, in the zftp module. You get all of zsh's features including command line history and completion (of both local and remote files). FTP commands can be used by prefixing either zftp  (e.g. zftp open, zftp ls, …) or just zf (e.g. zfopen, zfls, …).\nzmodload zsh/zftp\nzfopen ftp.example.com\nzfls\nzfget myfile.txt\nzfclose\n\n\nA: I’m all in to use Mountain Duck and Transmit for my ftp needs now that macOS does not ship ftp or telnet or other “vintage” and traditional command line tools. If you’re not into paid, supported software, check out Cyberduck.\nIf you only need command line ftp and don’t want to compile it yourself, go for homebrew to install  tnftp\nbrew install tnftp\n\n\n*\n\n*https://osxdaily.com/2018/08/07/get-install-ftp-mac-os/\nIf you might need other tools, the inetutils is a nice option. Also since sftp and ftps are different protocols with similar names, this other Q&A may be helpful.\n", "Q: Can't terminate caffeinate process, auto-restarted mysteriously, Mac won't sleep My Mac won't sleep, not even the screen saver turns on.\nIf I press the sleep option at the top left corner or hit the key combo: touch-id button with not registered finger, locks computer, then escape, sleeps.\nGoes to sleep but comes back after some time.\n\n*\n\n*I do not have any sharing options enabled (System Preferences → Sharing).\n\n*I do not have \"Wake for network access\" enabled (System Preferences → Energy Saver).\n\n*I tried to reset the SMC and the PRAM, but the key combinations I tried didn't seem to make and effect at restart. Maybe I should try more.\n\nRan:\npmset -g assertions\n\nfound out there are a bunch of caffeinate processes running, keeping my mac from sleeping. If I kill them, one always comes back.\n$ ps aux -o ppid | rg caffeinate\nroot             24456   0.0  0.0 408544784   7200   ??  S     4:32PM   0:00.02 caffeinate -d -i     1\n\nSeems like my Mac is infected with something. Downloaded Avast rans a scan, nothing found. Does anyone know why does this happen, which app does it?\nThanks\nMacBook Pro M1 Max, 2022, Monterey 12.6\n\nA: It's really great that you used -o ppid because you can see the last column says the parent process ID is 1. If you do ps 1 you should see that the parent process is /sbin/launchd. That's why caffeinate keeps coming back. Someone or something has created a LaunchDaemon config that is respawning it.\nThere are at least a few different scopes for LaunchDaemons and it's a little hard to find them all. I recommend using Lingon because it shows you every possible thing that is launched and what file controls its launch. The free version will show you things, the paid version lets you manage them from within the Lingon app. I recommend using Lingon to figure out which of the launchctl files is spawning caffeinate.\nA different brute-force approach would be to simply grep all the launchctl files.\nsudo grep -r caffeinate /Library/LaunchAgents\ngrep -r caffeinate ~/Library/LaunchAgents\nsudo grep -r caffeinate /Library/LaunchDaemons\ngrep -r caffeinate ~/Library/PrivilegedHelperTools\n\nThe name of the file will give you a hint at what app has created this file. E.g., a file named com.microsoft.teams.TeamsUpdaterDaemon.plist strongly suggests that it was Microsoft Teams that created the file.\nHope that helps.\n", "Q: Commands in .bash_profile do not run I have this issue with bash on a MacBook Pro (chip M1, OS: 12.5.1). It's been there since day 1.\n\n*\n\n*I set bash as the default shell in Terminal>Preferences>General \n\n\n*\n\n*I create and modify a new .bash_profile file in my ~ folder using vi so I can exclude line-ending issues, formatting issues due to the editor, and such\n\n\n*Most of the commands I write in the .bash_profile file do not work. For example, echo seems to work; source returns \"No such file or directory\" even when the file actually exists and the path is correct; ls and many others give \"Command not found\". All those commands run in the terminal with no problems at all\n\n\n*the PATH variable seems okay. export doesn't return an error message. Without appending new paths in .bash_profile, I have /usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/Library/TeX/texbin:/Library/Apple/usr/bin, which is what I expect looking into /etc/paths.d/\n\n\n*for example, the line export PATH=\"/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:$PATH\" to .bash_profile doesn't produce any error when sourcing the file; the line source \"/Volumes/Macintosh\\ HD/Applications/root_v6.26.06/bin/thisroot.sh\" (file, path verified) gives No such file or directory\n\n\n*the /etc/paths file is still untouched:\n/usr/local/bin\n/usr/bin\n/bin\n/usr/sbin\n/sbin\n\n\n*probably part of the same problem, the terminal overwrites the lines that are longer than the window length\n\n\n*among the attempts to solve the problem, I updated bash to a more recent version, 5.1.0; bash --version responds accordingly. Same errors.\n\n\n*the issue was there with previous OS versions as well. Updating didn't help\nHopefully, someone who ran into the same issues can share some good hints. Thanks!\n\nA: Thank you all for your replies! I think the problem is now solved\n\n*\n\n*Having either quotes or backslashes in the source lines actually solves the problem. Nice spot @jaume!\n\n*Moving the PATH definition line to the top didn't change things\n\n*All other commands in the file are now correctly executed\n\n*Lines are no longer overwritten\n\n*No differences between .bash_profile and .bashrc\n\n*For a correctly working system, the export PATH line is not needed - I agree with @nohillside.

I keep a thin paper booklet with a magnetically encoded stripe in the same thin protective case as my 2020 MacBook Air (1.1 GHz Quad-Core Intel Core i5), and when it's in my backpack it's pressed to the bottom side of the laptop.\nThree times now I've had to have the stripe rewritten or replaced, and it suddenly occurred to me that it may be related to the laptop.\nThe laptop power is off (laptop shut down thought the battery still discharges slowly but the fan isn't running to my knowledge.\nQuestion: Does my 2020 MacBook Air have an external magnetic field that might be erasing a magnetic stripe pressed against the bottom? If so, where is it? Back, left/right side, front, middle?\nI first thought of MagSafe, but of course this model doesn't have it.\n\"bonus points\" This is pure physics curiosity; if there is a magnetic field, does Apple have a spec for how strong it is? Earth's field is of order a half gauss, I'm just curious how strong it might be.\n\nA: You say \"power off\", but then you mention battery drain. If the battery drains, then the MBA is on, maybe in sleep mode, but that is still on.\nEvery electro-magnetic-wave (as the name says) that is used for WiFi, Bluetooth, cellular and so on also \"creates\" a magnetic field. The magnitude is much lower though (the constant connecting the magnitude of the electric field and the magnetic field is interestingly the speed of light).\nSo if your MBA is indeed still on and maybe also connected to a network or bluetooth device it does have a magnetic field. Further any current creates a magnetic field, however (although I haven't done any calculation) I suspect that the currents flowing inside the MacBook (i.e. not from the power brick to the MBA) are so small that the magnetic field is tiny.\nI haven't done any calculations whatsoever so I can't say anything about the magnitude, but your phone can simply measure it!\nThe app is called \"phyphox\" and available for both Android and iPhone:\nI don't know about the precision, however, it should give you an indication of where there the magnetic field is the strongest.\n\nA: I have a MacBook Pro (16-inch, 2019), so not exactly the same. But for many Mac laptops there are magnets along the top edge of the screen. They hold the laptop shut when it's shut. If they weren't there, the laptop screen might bounce open and shut as you walk, and send a lot of sleep/wake events.\nTake something made of basic metal (I had a small flat-head screwdriver on my desk) and run it along the black plastic between the visible screen image and the edge of your laptop's lid. You'll feel the magnets tug on your piece of metal. It's obvious. I have about 4 magnets on the left side of my laptop screen and 4 on the right.\nSo everyone else is correct: there are magnets in the speakers. But there are also magnets in the lid.\n\"Power Nap\" is a concept, too. Your Mac will wake up once in a while, join the wifi, mess around on the Internet (download email, update calendars, etc). So even though you put it to \"sleep\", it won't stay asleep. Go to System Preferences -->  Battery, and then select 'Battery' and you'll see the option to Enable/Disable \"Power Nap\" if you want your computer to stay asleep when you put it to sleep.\n\nA: The strongest magnetic field from a Mac is the speakers. Passing a magnetic card past them a few times hasn’t been an issue for me but I suppose you could have cards get degaussed but that.\nHere’s what Apple has to say about magnets and their products.\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211900\nI don’t have any physics references on field strength to provide, but Apple sells a MagSafe wallet to hold your (and possibly their) credit card right next to the phone magnets. In my unscientific testing, the magnet on my phone and wallet are stronger than anything I can get from the top or bottom of my Mac. With strong magnets in purses and wallets, I’m guessing you have another issue with your cards besides a Mac.\n", "Q: How do I use shortcuts with the left square bracket [ key when there is none? I'm using an M1 MacBook Air with a Swedish keyboard and there is no left square bracket  [  key though I can do that bracket easily by pressing  ⌥ Option  +  8 .\nXcode, however, has several shortcuts containing the   [  key. Is there any way to use these shortcuts with this keyboard?\n\nA: I have a non-US English keyboard on my MBP as well. Whenever I come across a keyboard shortcut involving a key that does not exist on that keyboard, I try two things to replace it: the key positioned at the same place on it as the US English keyboard or the key combination on that keyboard that produces the character in the shortcut. Sometimes neither works but frequently one does.\nThe left square bracket  [  key on a US English keyboard is located directly to the right of the  P  key as shown in the picture below. I believe Swedish keyboard has the  Å  key at the same location as shown in the next picture.\n\n\nThen, for example, for the Xcode indentation shortcut, which is Command ⌘+ [ , you could try Command ⌘+ Å . If that doesn't work, then, for the same shortcut, you can try Command ⌘+ ⌥ Option + 8 .\n", "Q: Samsung T7 as bootdrive not suitable? Does anybody have experience with a Samsung T7 as bootdrive? I used external SSDs for about 4-5 iMacs (all different SSD brands). This time I used a fairly expensive Samsung T7 for my own iMac.\nSince then I only have kernel panics for some reason and I can't find the root of it. Not clear if under load using Photoshop or just browsing the web, nothing really to narrow it down.\nI tried all the steps. I also contacted apple support and got to the higher tier technical support.\nI bought a second T7 and as the apple support recommended this time I didn't put my data on it with time machine or anything else. I set up everything manually by hand.\nAnd today I got the next kernel panic...\nAgain talked to apple support, they have no idea and assumed that maybe the power output of the USB port isn't high enough for the SSD and that the power drops cause the kernel panic.\nNot sure if this is a valid thing or not, I ordered now 2 different models of SSDs (one San Disk, one Intenso) and as a last step I buy (as recommended by apple support) a drive case with external power and put an internal SSD in it. Actually this is the last thing I want to do, because it's pretty big and can't be transported so easily. Lets see if that changes anything.\nNow my question here is: Does anybody have an idea if the T7 (the whole product/ model) is the problem here and if there is any incompatibility? Does it draw too much power? Is there a way to monitor (without any physical hardware in between) the power going through the USB port to see if it drops?\nAll energy saving settings are disabled, I went through about everything there is as far as settings go with the support.\nDifferent cables, ports I have already tried.\nI'm currently using the latest version of montery\nSome stats:\n\n*\n\n*1 TB Samsung T7 (both drives I tested)\n\n*2019 iMac 27\" with i5 (can provide full specs when back in office tomorrow)\n\n\nA: I am using a 500 GB Samsung T7 as the boot drive for a 2013 iMac running Catalina. Although the drive is capable of 10 Gb/s, the iMac is only capable of 5 Gb/s through the Type A port. I have also tested this drive on a 2018 Mac mini, where the drive does transfer data at 10 Gb/s through the Type C port.\nI am not having any power issues, however larger capacity drives may use more power. If you think power is the problem, perhaps you could consider purchasing a powered dock.\nFYI: The 2018 Mac mini has macOS installed on the internal drive and the user accounts stored on a 500 GB Thunderbolt 3 Samsung X5 drive.\n", "Q: 2018 Macbook pro Crashing/restarting frequently, help!

The YubiKey provides authentication with PIV. How can I use my YubiKey smart card certificate to connect securely to other hosts with SSH using the public key method?\n\nA: For doing this you need the Yubikey libykcs11 library what allows you to use it as ssh private key and if you want load it into ssh-agent.\nprerequistites: Homebrew, xcode\n\n*\n\n*install xcode as prerequisite for Homebrew\n\nxcode-select --install\n\n\n*\n\n*activate Homebrew https://brew.sh\n/bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)\"\n\n\n*\n\n*extend the profile according to the output from Homebrew installation; the following is valid on ARM based MacOS; on Intel Macs the Homebrew base dir is /usr/local\n\necho 'eval \"$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)\"' >> $HOME/.zprofile\neval \"$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)\"\n\n\n*\n\n*install the Yubikey PIV library https://github.com/Yubico/yubico-piv-tool/issues/118\nbrew install yubico-piv-tool\n\n\n*\n\n*Now place the required lib in /usr/local/lib to make it useable for openssh. It is required to copy the lib. For security reason just a symlink won't work for MacOS.(remember to search for the lib in /usr/local on a Intel based Macos)\n\nsudo mkdir -p /usr/local/lib\nsudo cp /opt/homebrew/lib/libykcs11.dylib /usr/local/lib/libykcs11_NOTALINK.dylib\n\nusing your key with openssh\nTo use your smart-card private key you need to reference the library above to openssh commands.\n\n*\n\n*just connect with ssh command:\n\nssh -I /usr/local/lib/libykcs11_NOTALINK.dylib user@hostname\n\n\n*\n\n*extracting the public key from the smart-card to be able to use it in .ssh/authorized_keys files or apps like git\n\nssh-keygen -D  /usr/local/lib/libykcs11_NOTALINK.dylib -e\n\n\n*\n\n*loading the smart-card private key into ssh-agent\n\nssh-add -s /usr/local/lib/libykcs11_NOTALINK.dylib\n\n\n*\n\n*removing the smart-card private key from ssh-agent\n\nssh-add -d /usr/local/lib/libykcs11_NOTALINK.dylib\n\n", "Q: Local Admin Login While Someone Is Already Logged In In my current job I am an admin working with Macs in a school district.  I previously worked in a district that had an interesting option for local tech accounts to bypass the logged in user by pressing opt + cmd + enter.  This presented a blank login name and password, you put in the tech account, and then you were on the desktop of the logged in user.  This was helpful for some troubleshooting we did, or when we wanted to login and properly log a student out of a computer, making sure to save their work if they left the computer and went to another class.\nI am wondering how that was setup.\n\nA: I'm not sure how they did it, but you can switch user account easily enough.\nGo to the Lock Screen (Apple menu or Command CTRL Q), and there's a button that says \"Switch Users\". You'll then be able to enter another username and password.\nThe original user will still be logged in, and you can switch back when finished. If you want to Log out of the original account, then again, that's the in the Apple menu, and once that's completed, there's a login screen for any user.\n(Logging out may take a while, waiting for apps to close, and dealing with unsaved documents.)\n", "Q: Is there any way to reset my Apple ID as all number? I used to have a backup Apple ID that I registered back in 2012 when Apple still allowed you to have a 6-character all number password.\nI accidentally enabled two-factor authentication when using this ID to log onto Apple Store. I don’t want the security upgrade. So I immediately tried to disable it following the instructions from the confirmation email. It turns out I have to reset my old password and get a new one following their latest requirement (at least 8 characters with upper and lowercase letters). I want my 6-character all number password back and also have two factor authentication disabled.\nIs there any way to do this? Thanks!\n\nA: No, you cannot set a password that doesn't meet the security requirements.\n", "Q: iOS/macOS audio player with millisecond-level delay control? I'm trying to perform an amateur experiment related with sound waves. Let's say I have a file on my iCloud Drive, let's call it wave1.wav. I want to play it on my Mac/iPhone, but with a slider or another way of controlling the playback delay at the level of single milliseconds.\nDoes such app exist? It can be a feature of some commercial music mixing software, as long as it's cheap  (< 20 USD) or has a free trial.\n\nA: On macOS you could use VLC Media Player (free software).\nIt has keyboard shortcuts ('j' and 'k') for decreasing/increasing audio delay in steps of 50 ms. In the Advanced Settings, you can set it as a numeric value giving you more precision over the actual delay.\n", "Q: How to change ssh port number when installed through MacPorts? I have OpenSSH installed via MacPorts on a macOS 10.14 system. I want to change the port its listening on to something other than 22, and have changed /opt/local/etc/ssh/ssh_config and uncommented the Port line like so:\nHost *\n  Port 12345\n\nI then restarted OpenSSH with:\nsudo port unload openssh\nsudo port load openssh\n\nHowever I can still only connect on port 22. How do I change the port properly?\n\nA: Always worth checking some of the related answers, for example, and it hadn't clicked for me at first.\nYou need to change /opt/local/etc/ssh/sshd_config. You've been amending the default port used by the client config.\n", "Q: Why the `/etc/paths` do not work? I add my php path into the /etc/paths file:\nmarkleo@mba ~ % cat /etc/paths\n/usr/local/bin\n/usr/bin\n/bin\n/usr/sbin\n/sbin\n\n# php \n/Applications/phpstudy/Extensions/php/php/bin  # A modificação da versão pode ln-s segundo PHP /, que é um atalho\nmarkleo@mba ~ % php -V\nzsh: command not found: php\n\nmarkleo@mba ~ % /Applications/phpstudy/Extensions/php/php/bin/php --version\nPHP 5.6.40 (cli) (built: Dec  3 2019 17:26:44) \nCopyright (c) 1997-2016 The PHP Group\nZend Engine v2.6.0, Copyright (c) 1998-2016 Zend Technologies\n\nbut I cannot use the % php directly, even restarted the Terminal.\nmy macOS version is:12.6 (21G115).\n\nA: /etc/paths is read from within /etc/profile by calling path_helper:\nif [ -x /usr/libexec/path_helper ]; then\n    eval `/usr/libexec/path_helper -s`\nfi\n\nBased on the source code of path_helper it is rather clear that this command has no understanding of comments in the paths file (something you can verify by just running /usr/libexec/path_helper -s or echo $PATH to see # php:/Applications/phpstudy/Extensions/php/php/bin  # A modificação da versão pode ln-s segundo PHP /, que é um atalho as part of your path).\nRemove the comments (and the empty line) from /etc/paths, open a new Terminal tab and it should work.\nPS: /etc/paths gets overwritten when updating macOS. It is recommended to put global additions to PATH into a dedicated file in /etc/paths.d to make them available to all users. For path elements only relevant to one user (e.g. ~/.local/bin) you can also edit the startup file of your shell within ~.\n", "Q: How to make Google Drive save files “locally” on an external drive? I have my own Google Drive and also a shared drive from my organization.\nUpon install and log in, I'm able to move what’s in my own Google Drive to an external drive where I can access files and everything.\nThe shared drive, on the other hand, is shown in my \"Locations\". If I mark anything for offline access, it gets downloaded on to the computer’s (iMac) internal disk (SSD).\nI want avoid this in order to avoid wear and tear of the SSD, and also, there isn't enough space for it all. Can I somehow make Google Drive use a different path for streaming/saving files?\nCurrently, they are being saved to /Users/me/Library/CloudStorage/ which is on the computer’s internal drive. Yet, Google Drive reports in its settings \"Folder location is controlled by macOS.\"\nI was thinking of hardlinking that path to a location on the external drive, but I don’t want to mess it up as I am not sure if that would work properly.\n\nA: An illustration here of where one sees the message \"Folder location is controlled by macOS\", within google drive's settings.\n\n", "Q: Open link in a new window in current space Say I have two spaces:\n\n*\n\n*Slack, VS Code, or some app\n\n*Safari/Edge/Chrome/etc.\n\nIf I click on a link in an app in 1 I want it to open a new browser window in 1. Right now it switches to 2 and opens the window in an existing/open browser in 2.\nIs this possible?\nI saw some other similar questions but they are asking about using Apple Script and that is not what I want. Unless I have to somehow have some kind of intercepter for links.\n\nA: In macOS User Guide there is article Work in multiple spaces on Mac which says:\n\nBy default, when switching to an app, the desktop automatically switches to a space that has open windows for the app. For example, if you create a new TextEdit document in Desktop 3, but TextEdit windows are already open in Desktop 2, your new document opens in Desktop 2. To change this setting, choose Apple menu  > System Preferences, click Mission Control , then deselect the checkbox for switching.\n\nThis checkbox is called \"When switching to an application, switch to a Space with open windows for the application\"\n", "Q: Recover partition on HPFS/QNX/AUX + Extended LBA drive.

I'm not too familiar with the macOS cli tools for disks (coming from Linux), and not familiar with HFPS and LBA.\n\nA: The diskutil list is producing the output posted because the signature shown as 0x0 should be 0xAA55. This would prevent the mounting of any volume on the drive by macOS. On the other hand, when tested using Windows 11, a properly formatted NTFS volume stored in the first partition would mount. Below are two methods to correct this problem.\n\nNote: When the sector size is 512 bytes, NTFS volumes normally start at a sector number which is evenly divisible by 8. Since first partition starts a 63, you might what to dump and review the first sector of this partition. See the end of this answer for the command.\n\nMethod 1: Remove second entry from MBR partition table\nSince the extended partition appears to be empty, you could just remove the second entry from MBR partition table. The command to do so is given below.\nsudo fdisk -e /dev/disk1\n\nThis command is interactive. The entries are given in the first column of the table below.\n\n\n\n\nEntry\nType\nComment\n\n\n\n\np\ncommand\nPrint the loaded MBR partition table, should be same as shown in question\n\n\ne 2\ncommand\nEdit second entry\n\n\n0\nparameter\nPartition id (0 to disable)\n\n\np\ncommand\nPrint the loaded MBR partition table, 2nd entry should be all zeros (unused)\n\n\nq\ncommand\nQuit edit of current MBR, saving current changes\n\n\n\nMethod 2: Replace the missing signature.\nThe commands below will write out the signature of 0xAA55 to the correct location on the drive.\nstart=100486575\necho 55aa | sudo xxd -r -p -seek $((start*512+510)) - /dev/disk1\n\nBefore using Method 2, I would recommend posting the output from the command below.\nsudo dd if=/dev/disk1 count=1 skip=63 2>/dev/null | hexdump -Cv\n\nThis output would allow me to check if the first partition contains a NTFS volume and that the volume is not larger than the partition. Or, you can check yourself. (Although, when testing using Windows 11, I found Windows will not mount a NTFS volume larger than the partition.) The boot sector description of a volume formatted with NTFS can be found here.\n\nA: According to Wikipedia, HPFS was used by OS/2, and was compatible with Win95 / 98 only as a network share. You may be better off using a Linux system to try and access it with, as there's driver support, whereas I don't see anything for macOS.\nA brief look at what's available at https://tldp.org/HOWTO/Filesystems-HOWTO.html#toc4 though that mentions 2.2 Linux kernels. A Google search may reveal more.\n", "Q: Prevent reactivation of non-subscription Microsoft Office 2019 When I updated my Macbook Air to Monterey, I purchased and installed Microsoft Office Home & Business 2019 (having an earlier incompatible version, 2011 I believe).\nIt's been working fine, but the other day, at about the one year anniversary of the initial install, Excel refused to save my work.\nI eventually figured out that I needed to log in to my Microsoft account and \"activate\" the program again, which happened automatically and painlessly once I'd logged in.\nIs there a way around this, such as editing my /etc/hosts file so that Office cannot \"phone home\"?\n(I find this behavior exceptionally annoying. Seems if I buy and install a program, and one that doesn't require an annual charge, I shouldn't be bothered with this. Imagine I hadn't had internet access at the time, and would've effectively been unable to use my software. Is my attitude reasonable?)\n\nA: \nIs my attitude reasonable?\n\nYes, I would be annoyed too, but you seem to have activated Office 2019 with your Microsoft account and this \"reactivation\" behavior is specifically mentioned in the license terms for Office 2019:\n\nWhen you connect to the Internet while using the software, the software will automatically contact Microsoft or its affiliate to confirm the software is genuine and the license is associated with the licensed device.\n(...)\nIf you activated the software by Internet, you may be required to periodically reconnect to the Internet while using the software to confirm the license associated with the licensed device; and if you do not reconnect, the software may operate with reduced functionality.\n\nThe easiest way to prevent this annoyance is to stay logged in, or log in and out periodically.\nNote that this only applies if you activated Office 2019 over the Internet, so if you owned a license key, you could use it and hopefully get rid of \"reactivations\".\n\nIs there a way around this, such as editing my /etc/hosts file so that Office cannot \"phone home\"?\n\nYou could definitely try that, but as mentioned by Ezekiel, this would probably cause your license to expire.\n", "Q: MacOS - Scheduled Launch Daemon Not Running I'm creating a launch daemon on my MacBook (with Monterrey installed) to bring back the battery percentage to the lock screen. I was able to craft the following command and run it in the terminal without any issue:\nsudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow.plist LoginwindowText \"Battery percentage: `pmset -g batt | perl -pe 's/.*?(\\d+\\%).*/$1/' | sed -n '2 p'`\"\n\nTo automate the command (specifically to have it run every minute), I created a file in /Library/LaunchDaemons called com.thecoder.lockscreenbattery.plist with the following markup:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n  <key>Label</key>\n  <string>com.thecoder.lockscreenbattery</string>\n\n  <key>ProgramArguments</key>\n  <array>\n    <string>defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow.plist LoginwindowText \"Battery percentage: `pmset -g batt | perl -pe 's/.*?(\\d+\\%).*/$1/' | sed -n '2 p'`\"</string>\n  </array>\n\n  <key>RunAtLoad</key>\n  <true/>\n\n  <key>StartInterval</key>\n  <integer>60</integer>\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\nFinally, to start the daemon, I ran the Terminal command sudo launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.thecoder.lockscreenbattery.plist (I also made sure that the file had execute permissions for the user, group, and others).\nHowever, the command does not run like it's supposed to every minute. In fact, it only runs when I explicitly run it in the Terminal. Does anyone have any ideas for how I can continue troubleshooting this? Thank you so much in advance!\n\nA: The elements of ProgramArguments must be the program to run (as a single <string>), followed by the arguments to pass to it (each as a separate <string>). You're trying to put in a shell command line, with multiple programs, pipes, quoting, etc -- none of which are supported here.\nEither put the shell code in a shell script (and put the path to the script as the single element of ProgramArguments), or pass it to bash with the -c option, and let that parse it:\n  <key>ProgramArguments</key>\n  <array>\n    <string>bash</string>\n    <string>-c</string>\n    <string>defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow.plist LoginwindowText \"Battery percentage: `pmset -g batt | perl -pe 's/.*?(\\d+\\%).*/$1/' | sed -n '2 p'`\"</string>\n  </array>\n\nBTW, when troubleshooting launchd jobs, it's often useful to capture output & error messages from the job with the StandardOutPath and StandardErrorPath keys. Something like:\n  <key>StandardOutPath</key>\n  <string>/tmp/lockscreenbattery.out</string>\n  <key>StandardErrorPath</key>\n  <string>/tmp/lockscreenbattery.err</string>\n\n... then examine the results to see what's happening as the job runs. (Note: since this is a launch daemon, not an agent, you could probably send the output&errors to /var/log/ instead of /tmp/. Launch agents wouldn't have permission to write there.)\n", "Q: How to reduce a Pages file's size? Having been using Pages for more than 3 years but there is one thing that puzzles me so much. And it can be a problem since I have written so many Pages files, that is the Pages' file size.\nIt is way too big, much much bigger than say a Word format .doc file.\nThe same two-page pure text document, if saved as a Pages document, has a size of 667 KB, but only 13 K as a Word document.\nDo you have the same problem? Any suggestion on how to reduce the file size? Otherwise, I will run out of hard disk space very soon.\n\nA: When a Pages document includes images or video, the File->Reduce File Size menu at the top of Pages can sometimes help reduce the document's size. See the \"Reduce a document’s file size in Pages on Mac\" Apple Support webpage for more details.\nIn general, however, a Pages document tends to be significantly larger than a Word file with similar content. The reason is that a Pages document is rather a \"folder\" with multiple files in it with metadata, a number of preview images and more. There is no way to permanently change that unless you save the Pages document in another format such as PDF, Word, Plain Text, etc.\nTo see that yourself, make a copy of a Pages file with a name different than the original (need not be a complex or large file at all). Then, rename the copy's extension  as zip and double-click on that zip file. This will create a new folder with the same name as the copy. Double-click on that folder and you will see a number of folders and files in it similar to that in the screenshot below:\n\n", "Q: Will an external NVME drive at 2700 MB/s work on macOS? I’m looking to buy a Samsung 980 pro NVMe M.2 and sticking it in an ACASIS enclosure. It should get 2700 MB/s read and write.\nI’m wondering if that will be fast enough to boot and run macOS purely from the external drive in a manner that is comfortably fast enough to get normal work (browsing the web, typing word documents, watching YouTube) done.\n\nA: I have a 2018 Mac mini with a 500 GB Samsung X5 external Thunderbolt 3 drive. According to the website Samsung X5 Overview, this drive has read/write speeds of 2,800/2,300 MB/s when used with a Dell Alienware System (Dee i7 Alienware 17 R5). The table below shows the differences between the Dell and my Mac.\n\n\n\n\n\nDell Alienware System(Dee i7 Alienware 17 R5)\n2018 Apple Mac mini\n\n\n\n\nOS\nWindows 10 x64\nmacOS Mojave\n\n\nCPU\nIntel® Core™ i7 8570H(@4.1GHz)\nIntel® Core™ i5 8500B(@3.0GHz)\n\n\nMemory\n16 GB 2667 MHz DDR4\n8 GB 2667 MHz DDR4\n\n\n\n\nSo while I do not know the read/write speeds for my Mac, I would assume the speeds are slightly less than 2,800/2,300 MB/s. Under normal usage, I do not notice any significant difference between running macOS from the internal drive and from the Samsung X5 external drive.\nYou state in your question read/write speeds of 2700/2700 MB/s. The website Things you should know before buying ACASIS 40Gbps NVMe SSD Enclosure (TBU401) has a table, which is repeated below.\n\nNote: For a better view, click on the image or open the image in a new window.\n\n\nBe aware that no read/write speeds in the table are as high as 2700/2700 MB/s. However, the speeds are on the same order as the Samsung X5 specification of 2,800/2,300 MB/s. Therefore, I would assume an external drive constructed from the combination of the Samsung 980 Pro and this ACASIS enclosure would be fast enough for your needs.\nThere are also the following advantages to this combination over an all-in-one drive such as the Samsung X5.\n\n*\n\n*Price: A 1TB Samsung 980 Pro costs 130 USD and the ACASIS enclosure costs 140 USD, for a total price of 270 USD. Where as a 1 TB Samsung X5 costs 500 USD.\n\n\n*Replacement: If the external drive combination fails due to use, you only have to replace the internal drive and not the ACASIS enclosure. Where as with the all-in-one Samsung X5, you can not reuse the Thunderbolt interface.\n\n\n*Compatibility: The ACASIS enclosure works with older USB ports. The Samsung X5 is Thunderbolt only.\n", "Q: Starting a few days ago, I have multiple unwanted app launches on startup. Help! Starting a few days ago, several apps have begun to launch on startup, without my having set them to do so.\nNone of them show up in \"Login Items.\" None of them show \"Open at login\" in the dock right-click menu. I have never had this system set to reopen anything that was open at power-down, and all of these apps had been explicitly closed at power-down.\nShortly before this started, the system hung at power-down. Could this have something to do with it?\n\nA: I did , as noted in my October 10 16:42 comment notice and remove an unfamiliar \"Login Item\": the name was something to the effect of \"Zoom Loader,\" and it had an exclamation-point-in-triangle icon next to it. The problem went away, and I have no idea whether it was from removing the item or from simply opening \"Login Items.\"\nAny further insights on what happened would be greatly appreciated.\n", "Q: Remapping keyboard shortcuts to use with international keyboards? I have been using the french version of a DVORAK keyboard layout, called BÉPO, for several years. However I’m increasingly facing an annoying problem: with the multiplication of Electron apps among other things, where you can’t customize the keyboard shortcuts through the Keyboard pane in macOS, there’s several shortcuts I can’t use.\nTwo recent examples:\n\n*\n\n*in Zotero you press numbers to assign tags to an item, but in the BÉPO layout to type 1 you have to press SHIFT-1, which in Zotero doesn’t trigger anything.\n\n*in the Notion electron (\"native\") app, you press CMD-[number] to switch between workspaces, and for the same reason as with Zotero this keyboard shortcut doesn’t work.\n\nWhat I’ve tried and didn’t work:\n\n*\n\n*trying to \"re-map\" shortcuts with BetterTouchTools\n\n*trying to do the same with Karabiner-Elements\nI must surely not be the same one facing this issue, since I’ve read many international keyboard layouts are similarly configured (i.e., pressing SHIFT for numbers, etc.) It also happens that some shortcuts that do not even use numbers won’t work for some apps.\nIs there any way to re-map keys with another application or by any other way, ideally on a per-app basis? Or any way to do it with the aforementioned apps?\n\nA: Well finally looks like I didn’t look far enough into Karabiner-Elements.\nUsing the complex modifications builder I was able to create a modification that applies only to a specific app and transforms a key combination into another one (e.g. Shift+Cmd+1 into Shift+1).\nSeems to work perfectly so far.\n", "Q: My mom offered to share her iPhone Health app data with me. Do I have to put MY data in iCloud to see HER data? My phone says: \"Health in iCloud is Turned Off The Health app uses iCloud to access health data that is shared with you. To receive invitations to share and view data, turn on Health in iCloud.\"\nI don't want my Health data in iCloud, and I know that if I ever sync my data with iCloud the only way to revoke iCloud's access is to destroy the data so that it is irrevocably destroyed.\nIs there any way to see my mom's data without compromising my data?\n\nA: Health sharing operates through the same process that Health in iCloud operates, so yes you have to turn on Health in iCloud to see shared Health records.\nIf you have a secondary device, you could enable it on just that device to see the records, but this is obviously less than ideal.\nYou can always revoke the data in iCloud without deleting it from your device. If you turn off Health in iCloud you can then delete the data stored in iCloud and leave your data untouched on your device locally.\nLastly, if this changes your decision, Health data is one of the few iCloud sync items that are properly End-to-End encrypted. If you lose access to your devices you cannot recover your Health data. This is different than your photos, emails, and iCloud backups, which can be recovered if you regain access to your account.\nhttps://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/back-up-your-health-data-iph11f1eb698/ios\n", "Q: How to publish Guides for Apple Maps I’m noodling around Apple Maps in iOS and came across this section about exploring guides.

I presume it’s like search engines only a blessed finite few are selected to play this role. Is that the case with featured guides as well?\nIs there a way to share guides offline to a file or an iCloud link or something of the like?\n\n\nA: So there is a share option for Guides. It appears to be a base URL (https://guides.apple.com/) with a query string that changes with each edit to the guide. So far it seems like adding and removing locations to the guide as well as renaming the guide all change some hashing function or something that correlates with each location.\nHere’s some samples below.\none entry\nhttps://guides.apple.com/?ug=CgJBQhINCK5NELXwxfzV182BbZeAA3DA3D\nadded entry\nhttps://guides.apple.com/?ug=CoJBQhINCK5NE0582F1ZDH6ULVHhINCK5NELXwxfzV182BbZeAR3013D\nhttps://guides.apple.com/?ug=CgJBOhIMCK5NENz0v5zGmY9nEg0Irk005L92FVkMfg4tUeEq0Irk00tfDF%2FNWL5t14\nSo someone could host such a link with an anchor that updates but it seems like clients would have to refresh their guides to keep up to date I would think since the query string is not constant.\n", "Q: How to support Telugu/Tamil characters in VS Code on macOS I want to paste Telugu/Tamil text from a PDF file to a VS Code file with a .js extension, but it just shows blocks.\nOther fonts, like Hindi or Arabic are working fine: when I paste them, it is showing the actual text.\nI just want to load the Telugu/Tamil font, I do not want to type that font.\n\nTelugu/Tamil font in the PDF file:\n\nTelugu/Tamil file in VS Code:\n\nTextEdit app:\n\nUnicode Image\n\n\nA: So, PDF's carry with them the ability to embed a font file in the PDF itself. The glyphs you're attempting to render within the programs you have listed clearly are not present/selected for in those applications (VSC as a for-instance, allows one to set the font they wish to code in).\nIf the font you have selected omits these characters, you get the blocks (which are referred to as \"tofu\" internally at Apple). Apple has done their best at a SystemUI level to prevent this from happening (if you've ever wondered what all those noto - e.g. Noto Sans - fonts that come pre-installed, they're glyph libraries. noto == NoTo == No Tofu).\nPick a font you KNOW contains the glyphs that are tofu'd out, use it in your editor panel in VSC, then report back.\nEDIT 1: You can get instructions for how to download the fonts using the inbuilt fontbook app here\nEDIT 2: Also, I have a secondary solution for you. Open your character viewer (On a keyboard with a , you can press that key to bring up the viewer, OR Press Command-Control-Space.)\n\nScroll down until you see Unicode. Select it. In the following panel, scroll until you see Tamil. Select IT. Finally, click a glyph. You'll see different stylings of said glyph in the rightmost panel. Clicking any will tell you the name of the font that supports it.\n", "Q: Outgoing message with blue outline In MacOS Messages, most outgoing messages have white text on a blue background (or green if it's SMS). But I have one conversation where one of the outgoing messages is blue text on a white background, with a blue outline around the message.\n\nIf I click on that message, the conversation is replaced with just that one message (which has reverted to the usual blue background) followed by one reply from my friend, similar to what happens when you right-click on a message and choose Reply.\nRight-clicking on this message doesn't bring up the menu at all.

Check calendar info on macOS and compare with the iPhone. On phone, click information icon next to calendar then select Subscription Details, and compare URI with that shown on macOS (select calendar then Cmd+I to open info). Verify that the subscription link is actually the same on both devices. Check on macOS what you have set as the calendar auto-refresh rate. Worst case scenario, remove the calendar completely from your Mac and re-subscribe.\n", "Q: Manual restore from Backblaze after Time Machine restore fails My 2020 M1 MacBook Air recently died, and Apple promptly repaired by replacing the logic board, among other components.  I use both Time Machine off a Synology NAS (RAID 1) and Backblaze. Both appeared to be working and the last backup date from both is several weeks ago based on the website for Backblaze and the last time a data file was touched on Time Machine.\nUnfortunately, the Time Machine backup seems to be corrupt /  I cannot figure out how to fix it.  I've used Disk Utility to verify the APFS sparsebundle of the Time Machine backup, and it says there were errors it could not fix.  Time Machine provides Error 112 (\"sparsebundle could not be accessed\") and I can't verify it using Time Machine (as far as I know) without Time Machine selecting the volume it cannot access (which seems strange to me -- I can browse the data files without issue).\nThat leaves me with restoring from Backblaze.  Backblaze backed up only the home folders, including hidden and ~/Library files and folders.  What is the best way to restore my (and my wife's) home folders, including key chains, from file backups on Backblaze?  I'd like to keep the same usernames.  I'm not sure how to move the Backblaze files over my existing home directory while its in use, and using a temporary username could mess up the permissions (e.g., my username could no longer be associated with the same UID or GID).\n\nA: When restoring a system that doesn't capture a perfect disk-level snapshot like Time Machine, you'll need to restore the files manually.\n\n*\n\n*Create your user accounts from scratch, using the same username and password if you choose\n\n*Copy over your documents and other regular files as you see fit\n\n*For things like your Keychain, you should be able to restore your files to ~/Library/Keychains however please research this first\n\n*Once you've copied over your regular files, go app by app and verify your data is there. If your data isn't there, identify where it's stored and transfer it over.\n\nThis process is a pain, but unfortunately Time Machine other local backups are the only backup software that can restore your full disk without manual work to restore it.\n", "Q: Synronize bookmarks in Books apps I added a PDF and an ePub to my Books collection on my Mac; they was synchronized between my iPhone and iPad.\nI added bookmarks to the PDF on my iPad and noticed that they were synchronized with my iPhone, but not with my laptop.

The goal is to use some kind of software on a MacBook in order for it to emulate a keyboard, mouse, and display, acting as a KVM (keyboard, video, mouse) console able to switch control between itself and at least one attached computer.\nThe connection to the other computer should be nothing more than a USB-C Thunderbolt cable, or a USB-C/male to USB-A/male cable like that used to connect a USB-C phone to a computer except that in this case the MacBook is the \"peripheral\" rather than a phone.\nThe intended users would be people that have a MacBook as their personal computer and a computer that is locked up tight from their school or employer.  The MacBook must emulate USB and/or Thunderbolt devices as there is no knowing if it would be allowed to perform BlueTooth pairing, some kind of network control (VNC or RDP as common examples), or any configuration changes or software installs.  While the computer attached to the MacBook is most likely a functional Windows computer of some type the intent is to have a MacBook act as a KVM console for the purpose of diagnosing a non-booting system, if the MacBook doesn't emulate USB then boot firmware is not likely to function with it.\nThe hardware required between the two computers should be no more complicated than a USB or Thunderbolt cable since this should be something that can be implemented easily and on short notice.  If the solution requires purchase of some hardware that can't be found at a grocery store or truck stop then the cost and/or delay just leaves the user getting a traditional KVM switch, a video capture device and other bits and bobs, or doing without.\nThe solution does not strictly have to run in MacOS so long as there is a means to run MacOS on the MacBook somehow still.  One thing that comes to mind is loading some version of Linux to run \"USB gadgets\" software to emulate the USB devices and then run MacOS in a virtual machine.  This could get out of the realm of a quick and easy install but it at least avoids added hardware that may be difficult to find, could be lost or broken, or again get us back to finding readily known hardware solutions at lower costs.\nThe software solution sought does not have to be free but it does need to be something that can be downloaded on short notice and/or a copy kept on a drive somewhere, and not cost so much that hardware solutions look tame by comparison.  Again, if there is hardware beyond a common peripheral cable then it could be easily damaged or lost but people tend to keep their MacBook safe.\nApple MacBooks can emulate USB and Thunderbolt devices for target disk mode to work so the hardware to make this work is inside the computer.  I suspect other brands of laptops have this feature but I'd like to keep this to Apple hardware for now.\nI recognize that a computer pretending to be a Thunderbolt display is not a common request, and support for Thunderbolt displays is not common in computers either, this is why I ask the question here as there's a lot of noise from internet searches making it difficult to find a useful signal.  Perhaps some guidance on good search terms to use is all I need.\nIf there's no software to get a MacBook to emulate a display then it would still be useful for a MacBook to emulate USB keyboard and mouse as that means more easily sharing the limited physical space on a desk or table with two computers as well as using a MacBook as part of a portable KVM console, the video being handled by a video capture peripheral or a separate display.  If the MacBook could emulate other USB or Thunderbolt devices then that would be even more useful.  The MacBook appearing as a drive, network adapter, or audio I/O device, are examples of what would be useful.\n\nA: TL;DR As far as I know, no such complete solution, working as you described, exist for the MacBook Pro or indeed any other type of laptop from other vendors.\n\nFor those interested in details about why such a solution most likely doesn't exist, and maybe looking for alternatives, let me explain a bit more:\nYour hand waving argument that Target Disk Mode exists and this must mean that the hardware to perform this task is already \"inside the computer\", I believe to be false. The hardware to perform the task of emulating a display and capturing the video data is simply not there.\nIf you look only at the task of emulating a USB device - then yes, that is relatively easy and many solutions already exist for this purpose. For example making it possible for a computer to present itself over USB as a peripheral (instead of as a host) - and emulating a mass storage device, keyboard, mouse or similar.\nA very easy way to do that is by running Linux on the MacBook Pro and configuring what they call \"USB gadgets\" (their term for \"emulating\" a USB device). For example that could be the g_mass_storage driver to emulate a mass storage device or the g_hid driver to emulate a keyboard and/or mouse. Many other drivers exist - for example g_ether and g_cdc for emulating network adapters, g_webcam for emulating webcams and so on.\nIf you want to do this from macOS, it is entirely possible as well - but it is not as readily available as on Linux. For example you can take inspiration from the foohid driver to emulate keyboard and/or mouse - but it will require you to program yourself.\nSimilarly you can do it with other operating systems such as for example FreeBSD - there it is quite simply configured using a sysctl named hw.usb.template, however it is a bit limited in configuration options.\nNote that there's no gadget driver for emulating a display, as that is not possible!\nRemember that emulating USB devices requires the computer used as the KVM console to have the needed hardware as well. I.e. you need either USB-C, a USB OTG port or a dedicated USB device port (i.e. typically a micro-B connector).\nA practical solution to your problem will require adding some hardware. You could for example use a USB-connected video capture device to access display signal from the other computer (i.e. for example the computer to be controlled outputs HDMI, and you use a USB-C HDMI capture device). These devices are available at a relatively low price today - i.e. starting at something like 30$ depending on where in the world you're located. Note that the devices vary in capability such as frames per second, maximum resolution, etc.\nAnother option is to simply buy dedicated KVM hardware. There are many large vendors (Raritan, BlackBox, etc.) that have dedicated KVM-over-IP hardware available - these are usually handy when you have a large number of devices to manage, such as for example a rack of servers.\nToday some smaller scale solutions intended for home usage also exist. For example the TinyPilot device, which is a ready to use device based on the Raspberry Pi. It costs $360, so it is not exactly a cheap device - but if you only need to manage a single computer, and you perhaps have other uses for it - it could be worth it. If you have multiple devices, this will end up being much more expensive than the previously mentioned KVM hardware. Also note that latency is usually a bit higher with this type of device.\nThere's also the option of building such a device yourself. There exists an open source project called PiKVM with software, building instructions, etc. that you can try out. If you have some of the kit in advance (for example an Raspberry Pi), it might end up being a cheap way of getting it to work. You can also buy a pre-assembled version for $250.\n", "Q: Siri shortcuts fails with airplane mode I'm running iOS 16.0.3 and have created a simple Siri Shortcut automation to switch my phone to airplane mode when it connects to my home WiFi (and another to disable airplane mode when leaving the area - but that's another story).\nThe problem, however, is that these shortcuts don't actual dis/enable airplane mode. The shortcut clearly runs, I see the notification, but nothing happens.\nI have other shortcuts which run when detecting that airplane mode is enabled (to go into Dark Mode, for example) but actually de/activating airplane mode appears to be broken.\nI have tested by disabling all my automations and only using one automation which turns on airplane more - and again with one which turns off cell data. Neither of these appear to work.\nIt is as if antenna automations are broken.\nDoes anyone have a workaround until Apple fixes this or am I mistaken/taking the wrong approach?\n\nA: Looks like my phone either needed a new battery or a good hard reboot, but this issue is now fixed.\nI've posted another question related to running the automation without user interaction.\n", "Q: Second window in safari fades black When I open or use two windows of safari, the inactive window fades black. Anybody knows how to turn this off? It seems more like a bug, then a settings though... Does not happen every time. Very annoying since I very often use two windows side by side and read on both.\n\nOn a MacBook Pro (15-inch, 2018) with macOS Monterey v.12.6\nAfter some testing a pattern emerge: If I click back and forward (the other window fade into black). If I continue to go back and forward 3 times (5 click), both will be in focus.\nHowever, it needs to be the same domain, otherwise it won't fade black. I notices that my other window was normal, then I closed one tab with same domain as my other window, and it faded black.\n\nA: I experienced the same. Apparently it is a bug. When dragging the tab out to create a new window, it should close the other tab.\nThe solution is to close Safari, open once in safe mode, and then open a few tabs and drag a tab to create a new window. As described here:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Safari/comments/xrrdm4/comment/ir14ifa/\n", "Q: Where is the Twitter Library for images stored? By this I mean: when I use Twitter or Fenix on iPadOS 16, and go to choose an image to go with my tweet, it displays a whole bunch of images, including a lot from my old iPad - this suggests that it is accessing iCloud, since my current iPad is only 4 days old!\nThe problem is that I have a couple of images visible in the “On My iPad” option in the files app, but I cannot find anywhere in the “iCloud” option than has all of these old files. I would like to be able to choose these two “On My iPad” images for my tweet, but Twitter and Fenix appear to be looking elsewhere. I hope I’ve explained the problem clearly!\n\nA: I was able to use a convoluted way around the problem. I viewed the files from the Files app, told Siri to take a screenshot, and selected the screenshot image in my reply tweet.\n", "Q: Different Styles for different Terminals I have a new M1 Mac (great machine BTW) so I need to run certain things under Rosetta. To that end, I copied Terminal.app to Rosetta Terminal.app and set that to run under Rosetta. I changed the default style for the Rosetta Terminal.app to a different color scheme so that I can easily see which is which. Worked great until I rebooted and then my regular Terminal got Rosetta style.\nI'm sure they are just loading the same configs but is there a way to change that?\nThanks!\n\nA: I'm not sure of a perfect way to do this because the default color scheme (known as Window Settings in Terminal-speak) is an application domain-level user default, which means it's set on a per-bundle-identifier basis. Since two copies of the same Terminal bundle share a bundle ID (com.apple.terminal, specifically), the last app to write to the defaults database and quit will be the one whose settings are applied upon next launch.\nThat being said, a decent workaround is to override the relevant keys at launch time via an argument. I can see two relevant keys when I read my defaults:\n\n*\n\n*\"Default Window Settings\"\n\n*\"Startup Window Settings\"\nBoth of these keys expect a string value which matches the name of one of your predefined Window Settings names (e.g., \"Basic\", \"Grass\", \"Homebrew\", etc.). So an invocation would look something like this:\n/path/to/RosettaTerminalExecutable -\"Default Window Settings\" \"Pro\" -\"Startup Window Settings\" \"Pro\"\n\nThis would require you to first have Terminal open, so you can write an AppleScript do this for you. In fact, you can even have the script execute the system copy of Terminal under Rosetta using the arch command (as hinted by @nohillside's comment). This way you wouldn't even need to keep a separate Rosetta Terminal.app which saves you a tiny bit of space and also has the nice bonus of maintaining app version parity any time there's a macOS update/upgrade.\nHere's an AppleScript that does this. You can change the WindowSettings variable to the name of your preferred color scheme for the Rosetta version and then save this script as an application so that you can simply double-click to run it.\n# Change this to choose your desired color scheme\nset WindowSettings to \"Homebrew\"\n\nset PathToTerminalExecutable to \"/System/Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app/Contents/MacOS/Terminal\"\nset Command to \"arch -x86_64 \" & PathToTerminalExecutable & \" -\\\"Default Window Settings\\\" \\\"\" & WindowSettings & \"\\\" -\\\"Startup Window Settings\\\" \\\"\" & WindowSettings & \"\\\"\"\n\ndo shell script Command\n\nThere are two limitations of doing it this way:\n\n*\n\n*If you've configured macOS to restore windows when an app reopens (System Preferences -> General -> Close windows when quitting an app is unchecked), any prior Terminal windows will reopen using your regular settings, not the overridden settings. This may lead to some confusion. You may want to disable this setting for Terminal only: defaults write com.apple.terminal NSQuitAlwaysKeepsWindows -bool false (make sure all copies of Terminal are closed first)\n\n\n*If you don't have an instance of Terminal already running before you run the above script, macOS will treat it as if you double-clicked the Terminal app and you won't be able to open the non-Rosetta version by double-clicking. To work around this, you can either pre-launch your regular Terminal first or go with your original plan of duplicating the app and change the script to run the duplicate copy instead.\n", "Q: Iphone 14 in Hungary - Budapest comes with physical sim or e-sim only?

What is the final version of Logic Pro X and Final Cut Pro that works on macOS Mojave? I currently have Logic Pro X 10.5.1 and Final Cut Pro 10.4.10. I don't want to upgrade past Mojave to use newer versions because I have a couple of 32-bit apps that will no longer work if I were to upgrade.\n\nA: If you already own the apps, then if there are newer versions you can use, they will be offered in the App Store app. If nothing is offered, you have the latest versions.\nIf you don't already own them, you will need to purchase them on a newer Mac, compatible with the current versions, then when you go to Purchased on Mojave, it will then offer the latest versions you can run. There is, unfortunately, no way round this requirement.\n\nA: The App Store update process should only offer you the latest version of FCPX that is compatible with your system.\nAccording to Apple's FCPX book, Final Cut Pro version 10.5 is the one that introduced a new minimum requirement of macOS 10.15 (Catalina). This is the one that dropped 32-bit support.\nYour Mojave installation should therefore be offered nothing after FCPX version 10.4 (10.4.9 or 10).\nFCPX version 10.4.6 was the one that introduced scanning your libraries for media using 32-bit codecs and warning you that support would soon be dropped (in FCPX version 10.5), so if you already have 10.4.10 or 10.4.9 then that's as far as it will go on your system.\n", "Q: Make system sleep after launchd task completes?

From the doc,\n\nProducts are considered vintage when Apple stopped distributing them\nfor sale more than 5 and less than 7 years ago.\n\nGiven each version of iOS is released along with a new hardware model, one can assume that the version of iOS will be supported for the same 5-7 years as the hardware is.\n\nA: A lot of this is guesswork, based on previous behaviour. Apple doesn't publish lifecycles & they don't really match those of other OSes at all. The best you can do is compare to prior historical behaviour- see Wikipedia - iOS version history for a full history.\niOS doesn't have a lifecycle like a desktop OS.\nmacOS has a lifecycle of \"the current & previous two\" main releases, which means that once Ventura is released, Monterey & Big Sur will only get security updates, nothing else. Catalina & all that went before are dropped completely. It's very rare, though not totally unheard of, that anything older than this would ever see another update of any sort.\niOS, on the other hand has a single year per cycle. As soon as 16 comes out, 15 becomes unsupported.\nHowever, because 15 is an end-of-life for some devices, it will see security updates for some time to come. Possibly one year.\nPart of the reasoning behind this is that if you ever have to do a restore on a device, you will automatically get the current iOS, or the last that device is capable of running. Apple has zero interest in keeping out of date devices on out of date OSes.\nAs far as I'm aware, you can still restore all but the oldest iPhones to their original structure, assuming the Mac can still recognise them. I think Apple are slowly dropping support for devices over a decade old. Though my 2005 iPod will still sync, I haven't tried to do a full restore on it in several years. I have a 5S that would still restore, last time I tried a couple of years ago, but nothing older to test.\n", "Q: I can't mv a directory \"permission denied\" yet I already did \"chmod -R a+rwX .\" I need to move a folder, and for some reason I can't:\nmv old_name new_name\nmv: rename old_name/ to new_name: Permission denied\n\nI already did\nchmod -R a+rwX .\n\nso all folders, subfolders, and files seem to have appropriate permissions.\nOne possibility is that a file or folder is locked by a process.

With vi-like bindings, by default, most control characters insert themselves, but Ctrl+U erases the line (however, Ctrl+K inserts itself, like Ctrl+A and Ctrl+E).\nWith vi-like bindings, pressing Esc switches to vi command mode, where characters don't insert themselves anymore but instead run vi commands. Press i or a to go back to insert mode.\nZsh uses vi-like bindings if the EDITOR or VISUAL environment variable designates vi. You can force emacs-like bindings instead by putting the following line in your ~/.zshrc:\nbindkey -e\n\n", "Q: Random greyed out window appears and doesn't seem attached to any app This random grey, translucent window keeps appearing on my screen.

I'm trying to run a 3rd-party application with Python. I understand that Monterey has done away with the system-installed Python 2.7, however, this application was released before Monterey. When I try to run it, I get:\npython: posix_spawn:\n/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/Resources/Python.app/Contents/MacOS/Python:\nNo such file or directory \n\nThe programming for the application is looking for the framework file in /System/Library/Frameworks. However, since Monterey got rid of the system installed Python, Python.framework does not exist in System/Library/Framework. I had to download it on my own, and because of that the framework file only appears in Library/Frameworks.\nHow can I change the path that Terminal runs when trying to access the Python framework through a pre-existing Python application?\n\nA: It isn't Terminal.app that's specifying the path.  It's the application.\nThe application calls the system function posix_spawn(), to which it is passing the pathname of the application to launch.\nEven installing Python 2.x yourself, whether MacPorts or Homebrew or a downloadable installer from python.org, will most likely not work.

FileVault was never enabled I understand that Apple can unlock it if one provides proof of ownership, but my friend bought his computer on eBay and has been unable to get the original owner's help.\nHe does not have a recovery key, and has forgotten the password. He decided to come up with a long and clever password, memorized it, and used it daily for about a month. Then his laptop charger broke, and it took him a few weeks to decide to finally get another; consequently, he forgot the long and clever password during this time because he wasn't constantly using it daily like he normally would.\nForget the icloud reset option, he didn't bother turning that on.\nHe's sure he never turned FileVault on, if that matters.\nAside from him being a fool for not better securing a record of this long and clever password, is there any way possible for him to regain access his data?\nI've done a little research, but can't find a definitive answer so I figured I'd see if any of you smart people might have some insight.\nAlso, what is the point of FileVault on a Mac with the T2 security chip if the chip is already responsible for encrypting the drive?\nDoes having a Mac with a T2 chip automatically prevent someone from booting into Recovery mode or Target Disk Mode or from accessing disk utility or a terminal without having a user's password credential?\nFinally, are there any stipulations associated with having FileVault turned on or off on Mac with the T2 chip, with respect to booting the device into something like Target Disk Mode?\nWhat's the point of FileVault being turned off if the outcome to my question is, NO, the data on his drive is unrecoverable and gone forever...?\n\nA: To answer the most important question in your post - if FileVault is off, then your friend can use Target Disk Mode to access the data on the laptop.\nAs for some of your other questions - you can read up on the nature of the T2 chip and how it works, but in short, the T2 manages the encryption of the drive, which is always active. Even with FileVault off, if a drive is removed from the machine, the data is inaccessible due to the encryption that is locked to the T2 chip.\nHowever, with the drive in place on the original machine, and FileVault off, the T2 chip will decrypt the data on the drive without needing a password, and Target Disk Mode can be used to access the data.\n", "Q: Safari slow on closing tabs Safari v 16\nOSX v 12.6\nSafari works normally in Opening new tabs or reloading the page.\nHowever it hangs up and it even shows the death wheel while trying to close a TAB, any tab, it eventually it closes the tab with significant delay.\nIt is not the Internet, since it loads fine, and Chrome works.\nCleared Cookies, Cleared History\nDid not clear Cache (yet)\nNo Extensions installed\n\nA: Found the culprint.\ndo not use\nSome contaminated web site was doing that.\n", "Q: How to name or alias shares in macOS file servers on macOS 12+? I have a number of SMB shares from a macOS host (server) that tend to have very generic names for normal folders such as Downloads or other such folders. I need to be able to identify these on the network as hostname-sharename such that Downloads when mounted on another Mac, Windows or Linux computer should see it available from the macOS host as macpro-downloads for example.\nI thought a simple method might be to create a folder such as, from Terminal:\nmkdir ~/shares/\ncd ~/shares/\nln -s ~/Downloads/ macpro-downloads\n\nBut unfortunately this doesn't seem to work since macOS resolves the symlink to the original folder path instead of using the symlink.\nWhat is the preferred method for doing such a thing currently on macOS when hosting SMB shares?\n\nA: To rename shares you use the sharing tool and would execute the following in the shell (Terminal.app, etc):\nsudo sharing -e current-share-name -S new-share-name\n\nYou may also find useful the following (notice the use of the jq tool that you may need to install via MacPorts or Homebrew):\n# list all share names (primary macOS host system names):\n$ sharing -l -f json | jq 'keys'\n[\n  ...\n  \"Downloads\",\n  \"USERNAME\",\n  \"USERNAME’s Public Folder\"\n  ...\n]\n\n# check the settings of \"Downloads\" share:\n$ sharing -l -f json | jq '.Downloads'\n{\n  \"path\": \"/Users/USERNAME/Downloads\",\n  \"smb_guest_access\": 1,\n  \"smb_name\": \"hostname-downloads\",\n  \"smb_read_only\": 0,\n  \"smb_sealed\": 0,\n  \"smb_shared\": 1\n}\n\n# remove guest shared flag of \"Downloads\" share:\n$ sudo sharing -e Downloads -g 000\n\n# again check the settings of \"Downloads\" share to see guest flag is off:\n$ sharing -l -f json | jq '.Downloads'\n{\n  \"path\": \"/Users/USERNAME/Downloads\",\n  \"smb_guest_access\": 0,\n  \"smb_name\": \"hostname-downloads\",\n  \"smb_read_only\": 0,\n  \"smb_sealed\": 0,\n  \"smb_shared\": 1\n}\n\n\nNotice in the above how listing all shares by their names (keys) in macOS still shows the original name. Basically there are TWO names and Apple would do better calling the name the remote clients see as an alias or \"share-name\" instead of just \"name\" so that it's easier to differentiate the internal macOS name vs the share name that clients will see.\n", "Q: VirtualBox - what is the keys combination to show the Menu Bar?

It mostly because does not exist the Home key.\n\nA: The popup menu, referred to in the OP's question, is shown below. Here, the guest operating system is Windows 11 Pro and is in full-screen mode. With exception of \"VirtualBox VM\" and \"Window\", the popup is the same as what would appear on the menu bar.\n\nYou can view or change the key combination assigned to this popup menu.

(In this case, the Command key on the left of the space bar.)\nSince your keyboard does not have a Home key, you would need to substitute \"Host+fn+←\" for \"Host+↖\", where the letters \"fn\" represents the Function key and the symbol \"←\" represents the Left key.\nIn other words, if you were using the Apple Wireless Keyboard A1314 shown in the next section, then you would to need use the key combination ⌘command+fn+←, where the ⌘command key would be the one to the left of the space bar.\n\nNote: When the popup shown below appears, the current Host key will be correctly displayed. However, if you have changed the \"Popup Menu\" shortcut from the default of \"Host+↖\", the change will not be shown in the popup.

I have a few computers connected through a KVM and one of my macOS systems has two monitors attached: the KVM attached display and a second display. When I switch off of the Mac, the still connected display becomes the primary display and things shift around, however I'd like to find a way to keep the non-active display that's attached through the KVM still \"alive\" to macOS such that both displays remain active as far as the operating system is concerned.\nI'm not seeing any software mechanisms that facilitate this - is there a setting I'm missing that can allow this?\nOr would some kind of a \"dummy\" dongle for the system be helpful to attach the KVM through to the display to make macOS think the display is still active?\nAny thoughts or options to make this work would be appreciated!\n\nA: There's no software setting for this, unfortunately.\nInstead I think you will want a headless HDMI dummy dongle with pass through. These exist in various forms and price ranges, such as for example the Fueran HDMI Pass-Through EDID Emulator found on Amazon for $21. At the other end of the price range is the Atlona Etude Sync 4K HDR HDMI EDID Emulator, which I found at B&H for $364.\n\nA: A “dummy dongle” that passes through the video will likely solve your issue.  There are pass-through dongles and ones that don’t for reasons of keeping a display and/or GPU alive for a “headless” server, it’s a hardware workaround to a software limitation.\nWhat you are likely looking for is a “fast switching” KVM.  Most KVM switches disconnect the display completely and so when the connection is restored the computer goes through the process of establishing a new connection.  In the early days of VGA the “headless dongles”, or whatever one might call them, would keep the connection alive by shorting pins together to communicate that a display was attached and which resolutions are supported.  Later on displays used a slow serial connection on one or two pins, and this carried over into DVI, HDMI, and perhaps other systems.  The delay and/or the reset of the display settings is from this serial connection being lost and then reestablished.  The higher end KVM switches listen in on this serial connection, relay that to the computer, and then leave the connection in place even while switched to another computer.\nThe pass-through “dummy display dongles” and the “fast switching” KVM switches are really doing the same thing, it’s just the fast switching KVM switch has the pass-through dongle integrated internally for all computers attached to it.\nI do recall seeing software fixes for this problem and some are more elegant than others.  One fix is a non-standard manipulation of the display output settings on the computer, to get this desired behavior people will modify bits of code that aren’t meant to be user accessible.  They can’t always put things back the way they should.  I recall people finding drivers from the GPU manufacturer that can sometimes manipulate the video behavior and have much lower risk of doing damage.\nA KVM that has that integrated “dummy dongle” is the lowest risk option but also highest dollar cost.  I recall seeing free utilities for changing video settings but I don’t recall their names.  Knowing they exist is half the battle.  What these utilities can do will likely depend greatly on the model of computer, especially if there’s an external GPU or only the one integrated into CPU.\n", "Q: Using ROUND in IF in Numbers I am using Numbers to track changes of time. I am using an IF() to show an upwards / downwards trend and there is an if that checks if there was any change at all. But I the calculation seems to be a bit too accurate for my taste.\nIF(D11=D10;\"=\";IF(D11>D10;(\"⬆\" & D11−D10);(\"⬇\" & D11−D10)))\n\nThe top-level IF() detects whether the compared values are identical, to show an =. Otherwise, another IF() is used to check whether the new value is bigger than the old one, to show ⬆ with the amount of change, or ⬇.\nIn one case, the calculation refers to cells that both show 65m (minutes; from an AVG() referring to other cells), yet it shows a downward arrow with a change of 0m in it:\n\nBecause the original cell format is all in time, I think that the calculation detects a change of seconds, but I actually don't show seconds here. So I've been trying to get ROUND to work on D11 and D10 for the first IF(), but honestly I am not sure what the syntax is here and I couldn't get it to work.\nWhat I am trying to achieve is to show an = when the change is zero.\n\nA: To round a number, you need to specify both the number to round, and how many places to round to.   So a simple rounding would look like\nROUND(D11,0)\n\nFor your formula, you can include rounding like so:\nIF(ROUND(D10,0)=ROUND(D11,0),\"=\")\n\nThe rest of your formula looks fine, I just modified that first IF statement to handle the rounding.  If you need additional clarification just ask.\n\nA: The IF() formula in your post looks OK. So, I agree that the problem you describe could be caused by the durations being compared not being the same beyond the number of minutes and rounding them might be useful.\nHowever, it is not possible to use ROUND() on a duration value such as 65m in Numbers. This is most probably the gist of your problem rather than how you have been trying to use ROUND() and IF() together.\nIn Numbers, to round a duration value to minutes for example, first convert it to a decimal using DUR2MINUTES() which converts a duration value to minutes in decimal. Then, round that to the closest integer using ROUND(). You can either convert the outcome back to a duration value with DURATION() or modify the IF() adding an m after each D11 - D10 to get the output format in your post.\nHere is the screenshot of an example spreadsheet using formulas incorporating these suggestions. I used AVERAGE() in the formulas only because you mentioned using it in calculating the cells in column D of your spreadsheet. I also pasted the formula at the top in the screenshot as text for your convenience after that:\n\n=DURATION(,,,ROUND(DUR2MINUTES(AVERAGE(A2:B2)),0))\n\nIf you are not using the cells in column D in your spreadsheet for anything else, you can just use the formulation above to calculate them and not need make any changes to the IF() in your post. If that is not possible, you can either add a column next to column D that would have the duration values in column D rounded as described above and then use those in the IF() or do the rounds within the IF() itself. The very last option, however, may result in an IF() which is a bit too long and hard to maintain.\nNote that ROUND() will round, for example, both 1.98 (from 1 minutes and 59 seconds) and 2.03 (from 2 minutes and 2 second) to 2. If you wish those not to be considered as equal, then you can use ROUNDDOWN() or ROUNDUP().\n", "Q: Files on external hard drive from Windows are not visible on Mac, and vice versa I have a 1TB external hard drive.

I expect this automatic joining is the underlying cause of your problem.\nTo allow your iPhone to act as a hotspot under such conditions, turn off the auto-join for your preferred Wi-Fi network through the network’s settings on your iPhone and then turn off and turn on Wi-Fi on your iPhone. When the cable internet is back, just turn on the auto-join for the network.\n\nA: I am assuming your phone is an iPhone here.\nAlper's answer is perfectly fine, but here is another possibility.\nTo allow hotspot, you cannot turn off WiFi completely - however, you can ask the phone to not connect to any network until tomorrow : in Control Center, just click on the WiFi icon.

I realize that this is a huge longshot.\nI have a 2017 21.5\" Retina iMac currently running Ventura Public Beta 9. Beginning in May of this year I started getting regular Kernel Panics. I have done everything I can think of and (almost) everything suggested to diagnose the cause of these panics. I still have no idea. Read all about it here:\nHow to diagnose too many kernel panics on a 2017 21\" Retina iMac running Monterey\nAnd here:\nIs It Worth Repairing a 2017 iMac With Frequent, Irritating and Undiagnosable Kernel Panics?\nNote that I'm not seeking further diagnostic help. I've already decided not to ask Apple to repair the machine. However, several months ago I started logging the panics to see if I could detect any pattern. Here's what I found:\n• Many of the panics seem to come in clusters of two or more within a few minutes of each other:\nKernel-2022-09-25-081410.panic\nKernel-2022-09-25-081717.panic\nKernel-2022-09-25-082024.panic\n\n• The machine never panics when I am away from home, even though the machine runs 24/7.\nKernel-2022-09-14-080601.panic\nKernel-2022-09-14-080930.panic\n\n[Away from home 09/15-09/21]\n\nKernel-2022-09-22-084222.panic\nKernel-2022-09-22-195425.panic\n\n• The machine rarely panics when I am using it. Most of the panics happen when I'm asleep or otherwise occupied. As a result, I have personally witnessed very few panics:\nKernel-2022-10-10-012503.panic\nKernel-2022-10-10-012817.panic\nKernel-2022-10-10-013241.panic\n\n• The machine frequently has multiple panics after installing an OS update. These happen when the machine is booting after installation of the update:\n[10/8 Installed Ventura Public Beta 8]\n\nKernel-2022-10-08-164919.panic\nKernel-2022-10-08-165238.panic\nKernel-2022-10-08-165805.panic\n\nIs there anything to be learned from these observations?\nAn additional observation. After installing the release version of Ventura the panics dramatically increased in frequency. On 25 October there were 28. Previously it was rare for a panic to happen when I was using the machine. Now they happen often when I'm at the keyboard.\nSince I'm now convinced that this is a hardware problem I decided to run memtest again; this time via the GUI remem. I first did ten loops which finished with no error. Yesterday morning I started a 100 loop run. It is now on loop 18. Still no errors.\nThe observation: Not one single panic while memtest is running. Why is that?\n\nA: No, there's nothing to be learned from those observations.\nAs per you previous panic logs, we can say with a high degree of certainty that you have a hardware problem. Your alternatives are really to get the hardware fixed or live with the kernel panics.\nI understand that you're not willing to test the machine with a non-beta operating system - that would of course be a reasonable thing to do before just accepting to live with kernel panics.\n", "Q: What are the Asterisk and Plus sigs on diskutil?

I'm using MacBook Air 2020. I installed a Windows system using Boot Camp Assistant a few days ago.\nI'm not sure if Boot Camp is a type 1 hypervisor, but I heard that we can't install a hypervisor on top of another hypervisor. I was wondering, can I install a hypervisor like VMware on this particular Windows system?\n\nA: Yes, you can install a hypervisor on a Boot Camp system.\nBoot Camp is not a hypervisor at all. It is just a completely normal, native Windows installation.\n\nA: It is possible to install a hypervisor on top of another hypervisor, this is done routinely for testing and training on hypervisors.  The ability to nest hypervisors is often disabled in software as this poses a security issue and a performance hit on the virtualized machines, this is rarely necessary for virtual machines put to production use.\nI believe you are confusing a hypervisor with desktop style virtualization software.  A true hypervisor cannot be installed on a Windows operating system because a hypervisor is a kind of operating system.  VMWare makes both hypervisors and desktop virtual machine software so you will have to be more specific which product you plan on using.  I assume you mean VMWare Workstation Player or VMWare Workstation Pro as those are popular VMWare products for virtual machines on Windows.  Either VMWare product should run fine on an Apple computer that used Boot Camp Assistant to install Windows.\nBoot Camp is not a hypervisor or virtual machine of any kind, it is a set of utilities and drivers for making installation of Windows easier on Apple hardware.  It is possible to install Windows on Intel-based Apple computers without Boot Camp, and people will do that for reasons of customizing the install in ways that Apple doesn’t support.\nIt is possible to install a VMWare hypervisor on Apple hardware, then install Windows on to a virtual machine hosted by this hypervisor.  Apple and VMWare support doing this on some versions of Apple hardware and some versions of VMWare hypervisors.  That’s perhaps outside the concern of the question but I mention it for completeness sake.\nI recall it being possible to install VMWare hypervisors on VMWare Fusion on MacOS, so I would believe it possible to nest virtual machines, VMWare or not, on the same hardware running Windows assuming that is the plan.  Nesting virtual machines requires this supported by the CPU, not being disabled by some kind of firmware security setting, and supported by the software doing the virtualization.\nIf all you are doing is one layer deep, no nesting, then you should be good to run any desktop/workstation virtualization software on any Apple product that had Boot Camp used for the Windows host OS, the guests may be limited in if they can be hosts themselves.  This is again not necessarily relevant to the original case but may come up for people with similar questions.\nI believe that covers the big points.  Perhaps I can edit this down to be more concise with the question edited to be more precise.\n", "Q: Tilde character in password interferes with SSH login From my Mac I sometimes access remote machines with ssh providing a username and password.\nThe password is generated and sometimes contains a ~. As soon as I hit the ~ in the password, I get some kind of subshell(?):\nuser's Password:\nssh>\n\nIs there a way to escape or escape or circumvent this?\nI'm on macOS Montery (12.6).\n\nA: When asked for the password, enter one arbitrary character like x and immediately backspace it, then put in your password. This approach works at any level of nesting, and it will let you keep escapes enabled, so that you can still use them later in the session if you want to.\n\nA: From my local testing, This should only be happening if the tilde is the first character after you hit enter. You can enter a literal tilde by just hitting it twice. The first will be captured by ssh and the second will go through.\nYou can see this yourself by doing:\n$ read answer\n~~this is a string~~\n$ echo $answer\n~this is a string~~\n\nIt becomes trickier if your ssh sessions are even more deeply nested. For those, you’d need one more tilde for each nested level.\n\nA: From man ssh\n-e escape_char\n  Sets the escape character for sessions with a pty (default: `~' ) . \n  The escape character is only recognized at the beginning of a line.\n  The escape character followed by a dot (`.' ) closes the connection;\n  followed by control-Z suspends the connection; and followed by\n  itself sends the escape character once. Setting the character to ``none''\n  disables any escapes and makes the session fully transparent\n\nSo running ssh -e none user@host should avoid the problem.\n", "Q: How can i rename several file names at once ? starting from - character till the end I'm going to rename thouthands of files at once.

I have been using it for a while and have been quite happy with it.\nIn your case, I suggest using the Regular Expression function in NameChanger. After installing and launching the app, select the files you wish to rename in the Finder and drag and drop them into NameChanger or right-click on them and select \"Rename with NameChanger\" in the context menu. You can also select the files you wish to rename through NameChanger's Add button.\nThen, select the Regular Expression function through the drop-down menu in the middle at the top of the app. Put exactly the following in the Original Text field (the one on the left):\n([A-Z]{2}) - .*\\.svg\nand the next one in the New Text field (the one to the right) as shown below:\n$1\n\nOnce you do these, check out the preview in the Renamed Filename column. A new file name appears in Renamed Filename column for a file only if its name is to be changed based on the instructions you just put in. If the two or more the files to be renamed have the same new name, the latter names are automatically added a number starting with 1 by the app.\nIf you are happy with the preview in the Renamed Filename column, click on the Rename button at the top right in NameChanger and you are done!\nBefore making changes to a lot of files, I suggest making copies a few of them under a new folder and trying NameChanger on those extra copies. Once you are happy with the results and comfortable using the app, you can go and change the names of the original files.

Does having a Mac with a T2 chip automatically prevent someone from booting into Recovery mode or Target Disk Mode or from accessing disk utility or a terminal without having a user's password credential?\nFinally, are there any stipulations associated with having FileVault turned on or off on Mac with the T2 chip, with respect to booting the device into something like Target Disk Mode?\n\nA: The point from what I can see is having the data encrypted is more about making it so much easier to wipe and encrypt when people want to.\nThe device will share the contents of the drive with anyone without a password until you enable FileVault. However, you can't take the storage out of one Mac and read it in another - so that's the primary benefit for having everything encrypted on an individual key that's locked in the Secure Enclave.\nWhen you choose to make the Mac secure - it's instantly fully secure now and can't fail to \"encrypt\" the whole drive once you start the encryption.\nApple documents \"the point\" of their defense in depth approach to security.

TouchID allows a user to log into a laptop through a fingerprint.

Use this or any similar app.\nOpen the database with SQLPro for SQLite.\nThe first thing you should see (in the left hand pane) is a list of the tables in the database.\n\nNow select Query from the tool bar and enter this query:\nselect datetime(v.visit_time + 978307200, 'unixepoch', 'localtime') as date, i.domain_expansion, i.url\nfrom history_items i left join history_visits v on i.id = v.history_item\norder by i.id desc\nlimit 100;\n\nThis will combine data from two tables to give you a list of the most recent 100 of your history. The only tricky bit is the conversion of the date to make it readable.\nAfter entering the query and clicking on the green arrow (Execute Query) you should get results in the lower pane similar to those in the screenshot.\nWhen you are happy with the result, increase the limit to show more (or all) of your history - it may well be 100,000 of more.\nUse the 'rectangle with arrow' at top left of results choosing 'Export export results set as' and 'CSV...'. Save the file which can then be used in Excel, Numbers (rather slow) or a text editor.\nDisclaimer: The query was modified from one I found on the web.\n", "Q: Selectively copying code and config files to iCloud It's common knowledge that it's a bad idea to symlink (or straight up store) your code (with .git repos) and various config files (plist, ~/.config, zsh_history) in iCloud. It's gonna be a mess when you inevitably start seeing myfile (1), myfile (2) piling up in various subfolders. I tried, and indeed that's what happened.\nI tried to go a different route: made a launchd-based daemon that runs my script hourly, in which I use rsync to copy files from where they are to iCloud-synced directory. This is better, and worked for a bit, but it's always breaking for some reason. One day rsync stops having permissions at random, another day my daemon just stops running. And somehow, the myfile (1), myfile (2) problem crops up anyway (albeit rarely).\nSo my question is — is there a way (a tool) that reliably and efficiently copies a few specific files and folders into an iCloud-synced dir? Without causing a mess, and without randomly seizing operation. Any help appreciated.\n\nA: For those who will find this by googling, here's an answer that gets you as close to working reliably as I could.\nTLDR: Use cron with a script that runs cp/rsync commands. Give /usr/sbin/cron Full Disk Access in your Security & Privacy settings. This is more stable than launchd.\nThe long story\nTechnically, copying files into iCloud periodically should work without issues, especially if there's only one source. It didn't for me.\nThere are 2 \"native\" ways to implement periodic tasks in MacOS.\n\n*\n\n*Cron (supposed to be deprecated)\n\n*Launchd (build your own daemon)\n\nI went with #2, because of cron deprecation. It ended up being quite a hassle to wrap my script into a .app package to give it \"Full Disk Access\", but it sort of worked (thanks to the linked info). I also setup 2 log files (stdout/stderr) to make sure it's working.\nI started having problems:\n\n*\n\n*The log files started being filled with permission issues. I solved some of them by disabling \"checksum\" checks in rsync. Still, issues continued, even in simple single file cp calls. I checked everything and couldn't figure out why issues persisted.\n\n*Occasionally I started getting myfile (1) myfile (2) files show up due to conflicts, which shouldn't really be there. I haven't opened or changed these files on other devices.\n\n*The job would just stop working at random. I couldn't figure out why. I would see an old last entry in logs.\n\nFinally, after posting here, I gave up and tried to switch to cron (without much hope, because I didn't see how changing to a different runner would fundamentally address any of these issues). I added /usr/sbin/cron to Full Disk Access, and setup my hourly script like this:\n0 * * * * /Users/max/Documents/Configurations/Executables/hourly-job >/Users/max/Library/Logs/HourlyJob/HourlyJob-stdout.log 2>/Users/max/Library/Logs/HourlyJob/HourlyJob-stderr.log\n\n(These log locations allow me to see them in Console.app.)\nI removed all the launchd stuff.\nSurprise, now it just works. No more permission issues. So far no more conflicts, but that's harder to check so soon. They might recur later.\nAlso interestingly, according to this, cron is unlikely to ever be removed. It's been 9 years since that answer and cron is still here.\nFor those interested, here's how I copy files in my script:\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\nset -e\n\necho \"job @ `date +\"%F %T %Z%z\"`\"\n\nHOME=\"/Users/max\"\nLIBRARY=$HOME/Library\nAPP_SUPPORT=\"$LIBRARY/Application Support\"\nICLOUD=\"$LIBRARY/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs\"\nLOGS=\"$LIBRARY/Logs\"\nCLOUD_CONFIGS=\"$HOME/Documents/Configurations\"\nPREFERENCES=\"$LIBRARY/Preferences\"\n\nfunction rsync_file() {\n  rsync -pgohuWE --inplace --stats \"$1\" \"$2\"\n}\n\nfunction rsync_dir() {\n  rsync -auhOE --delete --stats \"$1\" \"$2\"\n}\n\necho \"syncing ~/Engineering\"\nrsync_dir \"$HOME/Engineering\" \"$ICLOUD/\"\n\necho \"copying ScanSnap profiles\"\ncp -fp \"$PREFERENCES/jp.co.pfu.ScanSnap.V10L10.plist\" \\\n       \"$CLOUD_CONFIGS/ScanSnap/jp.co.pfu.ScanSnap.V10L10.plist\"\n\necho \"syncing Bartender preferences\"\nrsync_file \"$PREFERENCES/com.surteesstudios.Bartender.plist\" \\\n           \"$CLOUD_CONFIGS/Bartender/\"\n\necho \"copying zsh_history\"\ncp -fp \"$HOME/.zsh_history\" \"$CLOUD_CONFIGS/Zsh/zsh_history\"\n\n# … etc …\n\n", "Q: releasing iphone memory by moving notes to cloud?

I have a MacBook Pro 14\" 2021, and an LG UltraFine monitor that's connected to it through a thunderbolt cable. The monitor charges the computer. It also has a speaker, mic, camera, and USB ports. One of the ports is used to connect to LAN.\nEverything used to work fine, but recently something happened.  Once in a while, all these devices (camera, mic, USB) suddenly disconnect. The monitor still works OK and still charges the computer.\nI don't even know how to start searching for a solution to this problem\nI saw this thread but the solution proposed there (connecting another USB cable between the computer and the monitor) didn't work.\nEDIT\nI started noticing a subtle hiss from the thunderbolt cable connector every time an image on display changed. This gave me a hint that the cable might be damaged. I bought a new cable, and everything worked OK for one day, but the problem came back.\nTen days later\nI tried to connect the computer to the monitor using a TB cable, and connecting it to the power via the MagSafe cable. It didn't solve the problem.\n\nA: How old is the Ultrafine? If it’s more than 2 years old, and you’ve been using the USB-PD feature, it’s probably about to die.\nThe Ultrafine is incredibly poorly designed. The entire unit hinges on the single TB connector on the back. When transferring power this connector gets very hot. Over time both thermal and mechanical wear cause stress on the connector causing pads and pins to separate. You get intermittent issues and eventually total failure. You can try to re-solder the connection, but it’s very difficult to do because of nearby components. It’s often impossible to repair. You can try getting a new logic board but they are very hard to source the correct model and about $700 for the board alone. Even as an authorized repair vendor, LG will repeatedly send you the wrong board because “it’s all they have”. Apparently they have a bunch of boards from the first generation of this display with all the RF interference issues and this is what they send out as replacements.\n", "Q: A rogue process heats up my Mac - how to find and remove this program? A year ago I got a used Mindstorms EV3 set, fired it up and played around with my son. I installed a setup where we could write Python scripts to control the robot. The connection to the robot used bluetooth. But it was too time consuming; so we stopped using it.\nI think I uninstalled the parts that I could, but lately some EV3 manager part (Lego Mindstorms EV3 manager) has started running itself in the background erroneously, consuming 90% of CPU and heating up the computer. I can stop the process from Activity Monitor. But I struggle to find and remove this program. I have no clue why it fires up randomly!\nAny help? If I see a process in Activity Monitor, is it possible to track down the program and remove it?\nEDIT:\nAs suggested on this site, I sampled the rogue process in Activity Monitor to find its Path. The Path is\n/Library/EV3 Device Manager/EV3DeviceManager\n\nBut navigating to Library I cannot see a folder named EV3 Device Manager at all. I believe I have deleted it in effort to stop this very problem. Also, as suggested here, I emptied trash bin and restarted my Mac. After a while, the rogue process still persists and launches itself maybe once a day.\nI also did a search with Finder's search function for any files with EV3 in the name and only found my own written notes about this problem and nothing else.\nAny suggestions on what to do next to hunt down and remove this erroneous program?\n\nA: You can learn more about a process shown by Activity Monitor by double-clicking on it or clicking the Info ⓘ button at the top of the Activity Monitor window. The Open Files and Ports tab in the window to come out (the Info window) may especially help you find out which file may be associated with the process.\nIf that is not enough, click on the Sample button at the bottom of the Info window to launch a Sample window. At the top text in the Sample window, there should be a line beginning with Path that can help you further in figuring out the file associated with the process.\nHere is a screenshot of the windows mentioned above, for example, for the process Microsoft Excel:\n\n", "Q: AppleScript - Update Contacts app by reference to their ID I've been using AppleScript to create new people in the Address Book/Contacts app on my Mac running macOS Monterey 12.6.

It shows large is selected in System Preferences. I recently did a reinstall of the OS, is this a sign that it is corrupted?\n\nA: I am going to assume you tried to make the menu bar larger with: System Preferences > Accessibility > Display > Menu bar size Large (drop down).\nIf so, I don't think you have understood what this does. This does not change the size of the bar (i.e. give it greater vertical size).\nRather it slightly increase the size of the font used in menus. This also causes the menus to take up more space horizontally.\nThere is a good example in this from OSXDaily. And it says:\n\"As you can see from the before and after screenshots, the difference between the two menu bar sizes is very subtle, it may be barely even noticeable to some users. But if you look carefully, you’ll see that the size of the actual menu bar remains the same whereas the menu bar items, font size, and icons have changed size.\"\nI hope that clarifies what is happening.

The first replacement cable I got was defective, the second was accidentally damaged by me, and the third one finally worked. So I opened my computer at least 8 to 10 times to replace the keyboard until the last one finally worked. In the process, the Hard Drive Cable got damaged somehow, and I needed to replace it too.

I'm never interested in any of that Safari stuff. (Is it all even Safari?)\n\nA: Definitions are derived in order of preferences set in Dictionary app. By default, Apple Dictionary is before Oxford dictionaries.\nIn order to get a Oxford English Dictionary (or any other dictionary you prefer) definition:\nGo to the Dictionary app preferences (⌘+,): in the opening window, there is \"Drag reference sources into the order you prefer\"; reorder dictionaries as you like and tick/untick as needed.\nIn Spotlight, write 'express'; then, use the keyboard shortcuts ⌘+L to open the definition from your most preferred dictionary in Spotlight window or ⌘+D to open it in the Dictionary app.\n\nA: I suggest you stop using Spotlight for this purpose. To get more control over searching change to using Alfred.\nAlfred is a very configurable search tool, usually initiated with option-space.\nBy default (and you can change it) dictionary definitions are shown with the keyword 'define'.

(one or more options characters; see below), while ‘(?-o..)’ will\nturn off the specified options, and ‘(?o1..-o2..)’ will turn on the first\nset of options, and turn off the second set.\n The available options are:\n\n       i      Turning on this option will ignore case during matching, while\n              turning off will restore case-sensitive matching.  If\n              REG_ICASE was specified to regcomp(), this option can be use\n              to turn that off.\n\n\n...\n\nThe scope of the option change begins immediately following the right\nparenthesis, but up to the end of the enclosing subexpression (if any).\nThus, for example, given the RE ‘(fu(?i)bar)baz’, the ‘fu’ portion matches\ncase sensitively, ‘bar’ matches case insensitively, and ‘baz’ matches case\nsensitively again (since is it outside the scope of the subexpression in\nwhich the inline option was specified).\n The inline options syntax can be combined with the non-capturing\n parenthesized subexpression to limit the option scope to just that of the\n subexpression.  Then, for example, ‘fu(?i:bar)baz’ is similar to the\n previous example, except for the parenthesize subexpression around\n ‘fu(?i)bar’ in the previous example.\n\n\n\nA: To find all files, run:\nfind /Volumes/SeedDrive/complete -iregex \".*frontline.*\"\n\nNote that I'm using the -iregex option to match the expression in a case-insensitive manner.\nDown the rabbit hole of regular expressions\nRegular expressions come in two flavors:\n\n*\n\n*Basic (or obsolete), originally supported by ed.\n\n*Extended (or modern), supported by egrep and, when specifying the -E option, by find and sed. Extended regular expressions can also be used with bash when using the =~ operator.\n\nBut there's more: as explained in man re_format, the regular expression syntax can be enhanced to support \"additional features\":\n\nWhen the REG_ENHANCED flag is passed to one of the regcomp() variants, additional features are activated\n\n(?i) is an example of such an additional feature, called inline option, which is available for enhanced extended regular expressions only. When used, the subexpression after (?i) is matched insensitively. For example, given the regular expression fu(?i)bar, the \"fu\" portion would match case sensitively while \"bar\" would match case insensitively.\nUnfortunately, this is where things get blurry, because it's up to the command you use to internally pass that flag to the regcomp() family of functions and support those additional features.\nFor example, egrep supports the additional features:\n$ ls\nfuBAR    fubar\n$ ls | egrep -E 'fu(?i)bar'\nfuBAR\nfubar\n\nwhile find doesn't seem to support them:\n$ ls\nfuBAR    fubar\n$ find -E . -regex '.*fu(\\?i)bar'\n$\n\nWhy do your other commands fail?\nfind -E /Volumes/complete -regex \"(?i).*frontline.*\" tries to use enhanced regular expressions, which are not supported by find.\nfind -E /Volumes/complete -regex \"\\.*frontline.*\\i\" escapes the first ., which makes the first character of the expression a literal .. This will never match, because all lines returned by find start with the path you specified, namely /Volumes/complete, that is, the first character is /, not ..\nfind -E /Volumes/SeedDrive/complete -regex \"(?i:.*frontline.*)\" tries to use enhanced regular expressions, which are not supported by find.\nfind -E /Volumes/SeedDrive/complete -regex \"(\\?i:.*frontline.*)\" tries to use enhanced regular expressions, which are not supported by find.\nfind  /Volumes/SeedDrive/complete -regex \"*[fF]rontline.*\" is missing a . at the beginning of the regular expression.

First, I would suggest person B should simply try logging off the iCloud account in Settings (i.e. if there's no \"Activation Lock\" and \"Find My\" is already disabled).\nThe next you can try is for person A to remove the device from his/her iCloud account:\n\n*\n\n*Ask person B to turn off iPad B\n\n\n*Person A needs to logon to iCloud.com in a browser\n\n\n*In \"Find My\" click All Devices and select iPad B\n\n\n*Click \"Remove from Account\".\nThis will only work if the device is not activation locked.\nIf the device is activation locked, you can still remove your account remotely:\n\n*\n\n*Person A needs to logon to iCloud.com in a browser\n\n\n*In \"Find My\" click All Devices and select iPad B\n\n\n*Click \"Erase iPad\"'\n\n\n*Wait until person A receives an email stating that the device has been erased\n\n\n*On iCloud.com in the browser, go to \"Find My\", then \"All Devices\", select iPad B and click \"Remove from Account\".\nIn this manner, you cannot remove the activation lock without erasing the device.\n\nA: Skip to part 2 to get straight to the nitty gritty.\nDon't share accounts.\n\nPerson A gave his account to person B.\n\nA common misconception because people often think Apple accounts are tied to the device and Apple's language during setup encourages this misconception.  Actually, accounts are tied to the human.\nSo this was a violation of the Terms of Service.  One of the many punishments for doing so is this kind of mess. (or to be more precise, Apple's unwillingness to help with it.  By their logic, the account now may have private data for both A and B, and in order to protect A from B and B from A, Apple's best interest is to nuke the account for TOS violation.)\nSo you will need to sort this out without Apple.\nAlso keep in mind, this looks stolen. From Apple's perspective, Person A bought iPad B and person B stole it.  Apple very strongly desires to brick iPad B, because they are trying to create a cultural understanding that stealing iPads never works, you never get a usable iPad and possessing one will only let the police track you. As such, all of Apple's interests are to thwart person B absolutely.\nSeparating\n\nCan person A \"unlock\" / remove his account from iPad B without giving the new password to person B and without having iPad B physically and doing it on his own?\n\nI'm sorry, no, that is not possible.  Person A should not give their password to person B again.  However, since this is Person A's fault for sharing account info, they are honor-bound to help Person B resolve it, as follows.\n\n*\n\n*Person B must bring the iPad to person A.  - Then, Person A must log into the device with their private password.\n\n*Person A may allow Person B to use the iPad to export any data, both off the iPad itself, and also off Apple servers from Account A.  Or not.\n\n*There's more than one Cloud.  Many app makers actually store your data on their cloud not Apple's.  For instance games like Hearthstone or Diablo:Immortal, your game progression is on Blizzard (Battle.Net) servers not Apple's. Adobe's stuff is on Adobe servers. Etc. Etc.  However, you notice on the Web how you can set up an account to use your Facebook account to log in, so you don't need to setup an email/password login? The same thing can happen in Apps, and with the Apple account (almost by default, really).  So for each app, Person B should go into the app, and see if they can set up an email address and password for that \"app account\" e.g. Blizzard or Adobe. Doing so will disconnect it from Person A's Apple account and require email/password to log in to that app. (it would pay for person B to research this in advance).\n\n*When person B is done with data export, should give iPad B to person A.\n\n*Person A must then wipe the iPad entirely. (Settings -> General -> Transfer -> Erase All.)\n\n*Then Person A gives iPad B back to person B who owns it.\n\nPerson B will now have a \"fresh out of the shrinkwrap\" new iPad which person B can set up with an Apple account of their very own.  Note that if Person B already has their own Apple account, a very common blunder when setting up an iPad is to accidentally create another one.\nApple encourages this with bad choice of language in setup screens.  Apple NEVER allows account merges. (Honestly, I wonder if Apple does this on purpose to make people re-buy apps and music).\nThis \"Brand new iPad\" won't have any apps on it. Person B can go to the App Store and buy all the apps they want.\nNow remember that thing about setting email/password earlier?  OK, when Person B is starting up those apps, they should log into the Blizzard, Adobe, etc. accounts with the email/password they did set up.  That should bring their cloud data onto their new iPad - sorry their iPad now using THEIR Apple account. I've done this, and it works.\nWhy care?\nWhy should Person A help Person B? After all, Person B loses and person A is not affected, right?  HAHA.  Remember what I said about Apple's interests here? If A does not help B, B is likely to go ask Apple for help. When Apple hears that story they're as likely to nuke the account from orbit due to the inability to protect either person's data from the other person. (and clearly A and B are adversaries since they have not cooperated to resolve this privately).\nB has already lost everything so they have nothing to lose.  But they can make Person A also lose.\nThere's also an outside chance person B could convince them that the account has been theirs all along, and Person A hacked it.\n\nA: I know this will be an unpopular answer, but person A could give their new icloud password to person B so that they can sign out of the icloud on that device and then person A could change their password so that person B no longer has access to the account.\n\nA: You must use a computer to put your iPad in recovery mode if you can't recall your passcode when you try again. Your data and settings, including your passcode, are deleted throughout this process, allowing you to re-setup your iPad.\nYou may restore your data and settings from a backup after wiping your iPad. You can set up your iPad as a new device and download whatever iCloud data you have if you didn't back it up.\n", "Q: Cannot access directory on Windows share, even though it looks like I have permission MacOS 12.6, MacBook Pro\nI am attempting to use a Windows share exposed through a VPN from one of my company's servers.

I bought a 4th gen iPod classic with a replaced battery. It soon got to the point where it didn't have enough battery to play a single song and wouldn't even display anything unless it was plugged in and charging.\nI bought a new battery and did the replacement myself. It is behaving the same.  Is it likely to get two bad batteries in a row, or could it be something in the iPod itself that is causing this behavior?\nShould I get a third battery?\n\nA: If you're sure that the device is powering off because of the battery and not for some other reason, then it is definitely possible that you got an old battery depending on where you bought it.\nTo be sure that it is the battery, you could try:\n\n*\n\n*Fully charging the device\n\n*Removing the battery\n\n*Read its voltage with a multimeter, record that voltage\n\n*Re-insert battery and then use the iPod to the point where it dies\n\n*Remove the battery again and read it again\n\n*Compare the voltages\nIf the second voltage is significantly lower than the first, then the battery is indeed being depleted. If it hasn't changed much at all, it probably isn't a problem with the battery. It is unlikely that there is something wrong with the ipod that would cause it to deplete the battery at a higher-than-usual rate.\n\nIf it looks like this battery is the problem, getting a third battery (especially from a different, more official seller?) might fix your problem.\n", "Q: Retrieving lost photos My daughter recently transferred photos from her iPhone to her MacBook.

For both of those a lot of the traditional screw removal techniques won't be applicable. Here are some techniques I've used before that might be useful in this situation, and I'll provide some links to an ifixit page that I found.\n\n*\n\n*Putting something in the hole:\n\n*\n\n*Use something that is easily removable that you can jam into place with your screwdriver to help fill the gaps.\n\n*I've used bits of small rubber band or plastic to do this, it often works if the screw is loose enough.\n\n*Tutorial\n\n\n\n*Using superglue and a sacrificial screwdriver.\n\n*\n\n*Just put a small dot of superglue on the screwhead (less is more\nhere) and quickly stick a screwdriver into the hole.\n\n*Press it in firmly and try and get it to catch on something as best you can.\n\n*Then let it dry. Some superglue dries faster than others, check your\nparticular container to see how long you should wait.\n\n*Probably wait a little longer just to be safe, and then, while pressing down firmly, try to unscrew it.\n\n*Tutorial\n\n*This is more of a last-resort method as it may further mess up the screw (or at least leave it very messy), possibly get your device all glued up if you use too much, and might ruin your screwdriver (depending on the type of glue/screwdriver).\n\n\n\nFor screws this size, these are probably your two best methods for removing those screws. You could try a dremel to cut a slice in it but I would only try that with such a small screw if you don't mind cutting into the device or hitting other parts of it accidentally, as the screwhead will be so small that the radius of the cutting disc likely won't be able to cut into it without hitting adjacent parts of the phone. I wouldn't risk it.\n", "Q: Compare two directories using mac terminal while ignoring the \"._\" in the file name Just finished a copy of an external drive (exFAT) to another drive (HFS) using standard the Finder's Cmd+C, as I want to format the first drive (exFAT) to HFS. Now, I've been trying to verify all the copied files using -diff and -rsync for several hours, but for some reason, Finder has printed a \"._\" on all of the files on the exFAT drive, but excluded that on the destination drive. So naturally, both commands will tell me that all files differ, when they're actually the same in every other aspect.\nSo, is there a way, maybe a certain flag or something, that lets me use either the diff command or dry rsync command to display any differences apart from that \"._\" added to the file names. For instance, I used md5 on two files, and their checksum's identical, even though their names differ.\n\nA: You're misunderstanding what the dot underscore files are.\nThey are resource forks or extended attributes that ExFAT drives cannot hold, so the Mac separates these out into invisible files that ExFAT can hold. These files will be tiny. ExFAT also cannot hold regular unix permissions - these will often be lost.\nIf you copy them back to a Mac-formatted drive these are automatically 'folded' back into the main file, so will appear to 'vanish'.\nYou need to be most careful when using ExFAT that you don't copy Mac bundles, such as Photos libraries, Logic Pro files etc, as these can be badly damaged in the transition. ExFAT will treat them as folders & they may not get correctly re-assembled later.\nI'm uncertain as to whether this will render any attempt to diff the files useless, or whether diff will ignore the attributes & only consider the contents. Either way, you can ignore any dot underscore files.\nIn short - don't use ExFAT for Mac files unless you must use it for cross-platform compatibility. If you need to do this a lot, I'd consider getting an HFS-capable win/nix utility & stick to HFS+.\n", "Q: Need AppleScript to ignore extra line in TAB input file I'm trying to read in a tab delimited file that was exported from Filemaker Pro.

My Mac has a 1TB internal and I've only used 78GB. When I try to install using the Boot Camp Assistant, it is still asking for bootable flash drive, but I don't have one. Why is it that videos on YouTube can install Windows without asking for a flash drive?\n\nA: According to everymac.com, the Boot Camp Assistant can be used to install at least the following versions of Windows. The Apple websites Install Windows 7 on your Mac using Boot Camp and Use Windows 8.1 on your Mac with Boot Camp can confirm this information.\n\n*\n\n*Windows 7 Service Pack 1 (32 bit)\n\n*Windows 7 Service Pack 1 (64 bit)\n\n*Windows 8 (64 bit)\n\n*Windows 8.1 (64 bit)\n\nAccording to the Apple website Install Windows 10 on your Mac with Boot Camp Assistant, your Mac is not on the list of Macs that can install Windows 10 by using the Boot Camp Assistant. However, upgrading from a 64 bit Windows installed using the Boot Camp Assistant to a 64 bit Windows 10 is probably possible. If you have (or had) High Sierra installed on your Mac, then instructions for installing Windows 10 without the Boot Camp Assistant can be found here.\nI should point out that Microsoft support ended for Windows 7 on January 4, 2010 and will end for Windows 8.1 on January 10, 2023.\nAccording to the info.plist file included with the High Sierra version of the Boot Camp Assistant, your Mac (MacBookPro8,1) should require the use of DVD when using the Boot Camp Assistant to install Windows. I can not explain why the OP's question states the Boot Camp Assistant is asking for a flash drive, unless modifications have be made to the Boot Camp Assistant application.\nAccording to this Apple website, the only newest Intel Mac models can install Windows without a DVD or flash drive and the only version is 64 bit Windows 10. Your Mac is not one of these models. While your model Mac is probably capable of installing Windows without the use of a DVD or flash drive, I am unaware any website where such instructions are posted.\nYour Mac does not meet the minimum system requirements for Windows 11. However, Microsoft does leave the possibility of installing Windows 11 by use of the dism command. I used the dism command to do a clean install of Windows 11 on my iMac (21.5-inch, Mid 2011).\n\nNote: You can download, install and try Windows 10 or 11 without having a product key. However, to activate Windows you may need to purchase a product key. In the past, Microsoft has allowed free upgrades from Windows 7, 8 and 8.1 to Windows 10. Also, in the past, Windows 10 would accept a Windows 7, 8 or 8.1 product key. I do not know if either of these currently hold true.  Currently, there exists the possibility to activate Windows 11 on a Mac for free if the same Mac has had an activated Windows 10 tied to your Microsoft account.\n\n", "Q: Unaccounted bandwidth usage in activity monitor Here is a screenshot of Activity Monitor network usage tab.

I have Mac Mini M1 and using LU28R550UQEXXP Samsung Monitor it is advertised as 4k (3840x2160) monitor. But on my Mac, the only way get 4k is to use the Scaled display to make it look 4k. Otherwise the \"Default for Display\" is only 1920x1080.\n\nWhen it is on the Default for Display, the screen is really crisp, which I really like. But then again it's just 1920x1080, there's not much space for productivity.\nMy ideal resolution is that I wish to have the same crisp but on 2560x1440. Does that mean that I need to buy 5k monitor so that it's default for display is 2560?\nCan Mac Mini M1 16GB even support two 5k display?\nI'm looking for the most practical/cheapest way to achieve this.\nHope somebody can help. Thanks!\n\nA: MacOS is giving you a 2x SCALED resolution of 1920 x 1080. It is actually using all 3840 x 2160 pixels, but just making everything look twice the size.\nWhy? Because at 1:1 scaling, everything will be tiny. Your Samsung display has a pixel density of 157 pixels per inch, so you'll need to zoom in to 218% to get objects at 'actual size' (e.g. an A4 page).\nAll macOS is doing is adding the 'zoom factor' in for you. (Well, OK, you'll need to go to 109% to get Actual Size).\nI'd agree with the comments that you're not going to see much (or any) performance reduction on a M1 Mac, when using non-integer scaling. So you could try some of the \"More Space\" settings.\nIf you really want 2x scaled 2560 x 1400, then you'll need a 5K display. Bear in mind that if you get a 5K display that's massively wide, then the pixel density will be quite low, and so you'll lose the crispness that you're after.\nYour Mini can support 2 displays: Up to 4096 x 2160 pixels at 60Hz (HDMI); up to 6016 x 3384 pixels at 60 Hz (Thunderbolt).\n", "Q: How can I switch from Google Authentication to Apple Authentication Android user here since my first phone, I finally decided to switch to an iPhone. What a wonderful choice.\nI was able to switch to every Apple's services (passwords, mails, messages...) but I have one big problem : switch from \"connect with a Google account\" to \"connect with an Apple account\".\nOn every websites, every services I ever used in my life, everytime I was able to connect with my Google account, I connected with my Google account.\nBut the problem is mostly the 2FA.

Nowaday, the transition from Google to Apple is very fluent, but I didn't find any answer to this particular problem.\nDo you know how can I easily switch from Google authentication to Apple authentication ?\n\nA: If Google does not allow you to export the setup key, you cannot move it to Apple Password Manager, and you must re-set up each website.\nIf Google allows you to export the setup keys, you can enter them directly into Apple Password Manager and will start receiving OTP codes.\nI know that 1Password and Apple Password Manager can both export the setup keys for OTP Auth, but I believe that Google makes it a lot more difficult.\n", "Q: How to know what is the latest acceptable version of Xcode for a specific OS X or macOS?

The same would occur if you entered the following command.\necho ~/UniGen/* 2> /dev/null\n\nThe zsh shell expands * only to find no matching files, then generates an error message stating this. Both your external command rm and my builtin command echo never execute. Redirection only occurs when either command writes to stderr. In this case, the zsh shell writes to stderr.\nTry the following instead. Here, the zsh shell in included in the redirection.\n{ rm ~/UniGen/*; } 2> /dev/null\n\nFYI: Bash works differently on rm ~/UniGen/* 2> /dev/null. When a bash shell expands * to find no match, the string \"/Users/WGroleau/UniGen/*\" is passed to the command rm command. In this case, rm would output the following message message to stderr, which would be redirected to /dev/null. In other words, the following message would not appear.\nrm: /Users/WGroleau/UniGen/*: No such file or directory\n\nAnyway, including curly brackets {} would suppress the error message for both zsh and bash.\nBased on a comment left by user1934428 regarding the nomatch option, a bash like behavior could be emulated by using the subshell below.\n(unsetopt nomatch;rm ~/UniGen/* 2> /dev/null)  \n\nHere, \"/Users/WGroleau/UniGen/*\" is passed to the command rm command.\n", "Q: Unescape text in Automator I have an Automator workflow where text is passed from Combine Text Files into a Run Applescript action. I can get the text using text of item 1 of input but the text shows enclosed in quotation marks and the internal quotes are \\escaped. How can I get the text \"as is\" without the escaping so I can run the imported code?\n\n\nA: The Run AppleScript action doesn’t alter or escape its input, but text may be shown that way depending on how you are viewing it (the different ways to view the result of an action, for example), since that is how characters such as double quotes or backslashes are typically represented in a string.\nThe run script command can be used for running arbitrary script text, in which case you can do something like:\nreturn (run script (first item of input))\n\nNote that the run script command will also accept files directly, so in that case you wouldn’t really need the Combine Text Files action.\n", "Q: How to change account name in macOS Ventura? macOS Ventura has new System Preferences app and account names can no longer be changed from System Preferences > Users & Groups > (select a user) > Account name.\n\nA: I have just found out that you can simply right-click on the account you want to configure, to get to Advanced Options menu.\nAll the other steps are the same with macOS Monterey and later, as documented on Apple website.\n\n", "Q: Shortcut to toggle Bluetooth in Montery via blueutil shell script executed with AppleScript in BetterTouchTool I have set the Mission Control key in BetterTouchTool to execute an AppleScript and it worked fine before the update from Mojave to Montery which I just did\ndo shell script \"../bluetoggle.sh\"\n\ncontent of file is\n#!/bin/sh \n\nblueutil -p toggle\n\nbut can't execute in BetterTouchTool.. it says\n\nExecuting file from Terminal works flawless.\nExecuting another script (do shell script \"../karaprof.sh\") in BetterTouchTool with following content to switch profile in Karabiner also works perfectly\n#!/bin/sh\n\npro0=\"e\"\npro1=\"g\"\n\ncli='/Library/Application Support/org.pqrs/Karabiner-Elements/bin/karabiner_cli'\n\nname=$(\"$cli\" --show-current-profile-name)\nif [ \"$name\" = $pro0 ]; then\n\"$cli\" --select-profile $pro1\nelse\n\"$cli\" --select-profile $pro0\nfi\n\nSo my guess is I need to set permission for BetterTouchTool to execute scripts in Terminal, but how?

I can see that the service is running, and the mysql client is installed as well.\nAny attempt to get to the database via the client, like\nmysql -u root -p\n\nor more simply\nmysql -u root\n\nas the installation process suggests, asks for a password with the prompt \"Enter password:\".

I am on a system with an external monitor and it is awkward to have to go to the primary display to get to a menu option that is on the external display.  In any case, I don't want to move the mouse very far.\nIs this possible?\n\nA: The menu bar will appear on all displays if you go to System Preferences > Mission Control, and tick the setting \"Displays have separate Spaces\".\nThere is no way to customise the interface to put the menubar in a window. Some menus, e.g. \"Window\", control things relating to more than the current window, and/or the application as a whole.\nAlso remember that unlike Windows, each document window is not a separate instance of the application: the application process can still be running without any document windows.

So I'll ignore the message until the print quality is effected.\nHow can I disable this \"The printer is low on toner.\" iOS alert?\n\nA: Most printers issue alerts about low toner. There may be a method of turning it off on the printer itself; or changing the threshold for when the alert triggers.\nThis can usually be controlled on a physical control panel on the device; or a web interface; or a Utility app.\nPrinters will also usually show a % indicator for how much toner is left. You can then see whether the printer is indeed getting low on toner. If it is still at a high percentage, then this may warrant further investigation.\nIt's always good to have a new cartridge on hand for when the toner does actually run out, which is of course when you most need it.\n", "Q: Moving photo library from an iPhone to another iPhone via Computer I need to migrate and merge the contents of 2 old iPhones (lets call them i1 and i2) to a new iPhone (i_new).\niPhones have built-in migration functionality, but AFAIK it doesn't allow to move stuff from multiple iPhones onto a single device.\nSo, I am planning to migrate the contents of one older iPhone i1 to i_new with that tool and then move the stuff from the other one (i2) to i_new manually. Specifically: Notes, photos & videos, safari tabs.\nI can access the photos on i2 from a computer (within DCIM folder) using a USB cable.\nMy question is:\nIf I move the contents of i2's DCIM to a PC, what would be the best way to add these photos to the i_new such that i_new would be able to accept them in its Photos App and properly sort them by the date taken within its \"camera roll\"?\nCan I copy them from PC to i_new's DCIM, or is iPhone's storage read-only when connected via USB as a \"flash drive\"?\nAlso, are all photos and videos from the Photos App located within DCIM, or are there any photos/vids hidden elsewhere?\nThanks\n\nA: You cannot write photos to an iPhone except through the syncing mechanism exposed in Finder & iTunes.\nYour best bet will be to enable iCloud Photos on each device and allow them to sync & merge, then disable iCloud Photos.\n", "Q: How can I export an iphone screen recording without sound?

It is not Linux.\nYou've instructed ssh to forward X11 through a tunnel back to the original machine, but there is no X11 to forward.\n\nA: Apple does screen sharing over the VNC ports - so you could port forward them over ssh once you've sorted out your VNC access.

There is even the same flex cable between them that can be easily exchanged.\nAn iPhone 14 Pro teardown shows that the battery has been replaced. Although I did not try to exchange myself.\nIf you are considering exchanging yourself, ask yourself whether it is really necessary.

The UM2 is a basic interface, and the outs are shared on one knob. there isn't a way to separate this from the device itself.

I am not sure if 8.2.0.0.1.1480973914 is the same available as the .dmg file\n\n\nA: The https://developer.apple.com/download/all page works as expected.\nIt was a confusion of terms by my side (consequence of many hours of work), if the search criteria is used as:\n\n*\n\n*Either Command Line Tools 8.2 or Command Line Tools 10.11 returns among many results the Command Line Tools (macOS 10.11) for Xcode 8.2 result\n\n*Xcode 8.2.1 that returns as unique result the expected Xcode 8.2.1 mentioned at Xcode Releases\nTherefore is different Command Line Tools (macOS 10.11) for Xcode 8.2 vs Xcode 8.2.1.

I know this might be possible in alternatives to the Finder (PathFinder, TotalFinder, Marta, etc.) but I've found those—even though they have some really nice benefits, like the extensibility of Marta—to give me much more pain than benefit, so I'd like to instead fix the main glaring flaw in the Finder, if that's possible.\nI don't want to permanently make the Finder show all dot files (sometimes called \"hidden\", although that's ambiguous since there are other ways to hide files in Apple file systems), so the solution using defaults write is out (and that may or may not affect searches, anyway).\n⌘ ⇧ . is awesome and solves the problem when browsing in the Finder, giving me nice clean lists of folders and files for the 80% of the time that I want that, but showing me dot files for the 20% that I want those to be visible.\nBut what about when searching?  In the following example, I'm looking for all locations of Obsidian vaults, which store their settings in a directory viewable in a terminal window as .obsidian, but this cannot be found as folder in the Finder.  How can I fix that?\n\n\nA: First, I can confirm what you are seeing with 'dot' files and folders.\nWhat I believe is happening is:\n\n*\n\n*Finder uses the Spotlight index to look for files.\n\n*Spotlight doesn't not index dot files.\n\n*Therefore Finder search does not find dot files.\n\nThe same is true for other apps which use the Spotlight index - e.g.HoudahSpot.\nMy evidence for this is the brevity of output from mdls:\nmdls .zshrc\nkMDItemFSContentChangeDate = 2022-07-17 23:14:31 +0000\nkMDItemFSCreationDate      = 2021-11-11 23:54:13 +0000\nkMDItemFSCreatorCode       = \"\"\nkMDItemFSFinderFlags       = 0\nkMDItemFSHasCustomIcon     = 0\nkMDItemFSInvisible         = 1\nkMDItemFSIsExtensionHidden = 0\nkMDItemFSIsStationery      = 0\nkMDItemFSLabel             = 0\nkMDItemFSName              = \".zshrc\"\nkMDItemFSNodeCount         = 830\nkMDItemFSOwnerGroupID      = 20\nkMDItemFSOwnerUserID       = 501\nkMDItemFSSize              = 830\n\nTo find Dot files/folders, you need to use an app which scans all folders. For this I use Find Any File or EasyFind. (EasyFind is free, but FAF is faster).\nHere is EasyFind looking for both .cups (a folder) and .zshrc (a file).\n\nDon't miss the tick box at the bottom left.\nI am sure you will be able to search for .obsidian to find the folders you are looking for.\n", "Q: Error: jpeg-turbo: undefined method `on_intel' for when I using this command to install graphviz, shows error like this:\n➜  interview-question git:(master) brew install graphviz\nWarning: No remote 'origin' in /opt/homebrew/Library/Taps/homebrew/homebrew-services, skipping update!\nRunning `brew update --auto-update`...\nError: jpeg-turbo: undefined method `on_intel' for #<Class:0x000000014591bec8>\n\nwhy did this happen? what should I do to avoid this problem? this is the brew doctor output:\n➜  interview-question git:(master) brew doctor\nPlease note that these warnings are just used to help the Homebrew maintainers\nwith debugging if you file an issue.

When Time Machine starts a backup, does it somehow take a snapshot of the current state of the filesystem such that any changes made to files after the backup starts are not reflected in the backup?  I'm wondering about self-consistency of Time Machine backups.  Are Time Machine backups perfectly consistent?\nIn case it isn't clear what I'm saying, here's an example.  Say I have three files in a directory, 'a', 'b', and 'c', and each of them is 100 bytes in size.  I start a Time Machine backup that is going to take a considerable amount of time...let's say an hour for argument sake.\nIn the next few minutes after starting the backup, I delete file 'a', append new information onto file 'b' making it 200 bytes in length, and create a new file 'd'.  After the backup finishes, and I go in and look at the resulting snapshot, am I guaranteed to see three files 'a', 'b', and 'c', each of 100 bytes in length, and no file 'd'?  Or is there no consistency guaranteed...how each of these files is backed up is a matter of when Time Machine actually backs up those particular files?\nIf someone thinks that Time Machine does take consistent snapshots, I would love to have a citation coming from Apple or someone who has rigorously tested to make sure this is the case.  I have a particular reason to need to rely on such behavior.\nTIA for any info!\nPS: I think we are all running Monterey.  We certainly all could be if it made a difference. I assume we're all running standard APFS setups.\n\nA: Time Machine takes an APFS snapshot and backs up the snapshot. The snapshot is a point-in-time of the disk when the snapshot is taken.\nYou can validate this by using Disk Utility. First, start a backup and wait for \"Preparing\" or the actual backup stage. Then open Disk Utility and select your Data partition. Use the View menu and show APFS snapshots. You will see a new one from the time when your backup was started.\n\nA: You will end up with a consistent backup for some point in time. That point of time cannot be at the start of the backup: If you changed a file again before it is backed up, the original wouldn’t be there anymore.\nSo when you make changes during a backup, they will be added to the backup. And the completed backup matches your computer at the time the backup was finished.\n", "Q: Terminal command to play sound file from iCloud drive if i run a terminal command to play a sound from a local drive, such as afplay /Users/username/Music/file.aiff it plays.\nHowever, if I try the same thing with a file on iCloud it will not:  afplay /Users/username/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Sounds/file.aiff\nAnd outputs this:\nOptions: (may appear before or after arguments)\n  {-v | --volume} VOLUME\n    set the volume for playback of the file\n  {-h | --help}\n    print help\n  { --leaks}\n    run leaks analysis\n  {-t | --time} TIME\n    play for TIME seconds\n  {-r | --rate} RATE\n    play at playback rate\n  {-q | --rQuality} QUALITY\n    set the quality used for rate-scaled playback (default is 0 - low quality, 1 - high quality)\n  {-d | --debug}\n    debug print output\n\nany advice?\n\nA: As with any shell command, you need to escape the space in the path name:\nafplay ~/Library/Mobile\\ Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Sounds/file.aiff\n\nYou also need to make sure that the file to be played is actually downloaded from iCloud.

Is that the right way to approach this?\nAlso, note here that just having the Zoom application open doesn't mean we're on a call - when the call ends, most of the time people keep Zoom open. It's only the Zoom call window that gets closed. Luckily, whenever there is a Zoom call, it always seems to be in a window called \"Zoom Meeting\" and that doesn't change.\nI'd prefer not to use any third-party software unless it's free and open source.\nWhat's the best way to achieve this?\n\nA: Keyboard Maestro is definitely your best solution to this and so many other scripts and shortcuts in the future! I don't know the particulars of your USB light, but the following simple action should prompt an alert when Zoom launches. You could write a similar script to reverse the process when Zoom quits.\n\n\nA: You can do with this with AppleScript. However, because the Zoom application does not support AppleScript, you have to use the Finder Accessibility features, and that means you have to allow your AppleScript application to control your computer. It is a one-time step, and a minor security risk imho.\nCreate the following script using the Script Editor:\ntell application \"zoom.us\" to activate\n\ntell application \"System Events\"\n\n\n    tell process \"zoom.us\"\n        \n        repeat until window \"Zoom Meeting\" exists\n            delay 1\n        end repeat\n        -- do something here (On Air light)\n        -- for example, run a shell script:\n        -- do shell script \"command\"\n        display dialog \"Zoom Meeting Started\" buttons \"OK\" default button \"OK\"\n        \n        repeat until not (window \"Zoom Meeting\" exists)\n            delay 1\n        end repeat\n        -- do something here\n        -- for example, run a shell script:\n        -- do shell script \"command\"\n        display dialog \"Zoom Meeting Ended\" buttons \"OK\" default button \"OK\"\n        \n    end tell\n    \nend tell\n\nSave this script as an application, and then try to run it. You will get the Finder security warning about needing to give this application access to Accessibility features. After you enable this under \"Security & Privacy\" in the System Preferences, it will work fine.\nOnce the application is working on your system, you can add it to the list of Login Items like any other application to make it run automatically on startup.\n", "Q: Sharing web page as a file I have a sort of \"book\" in the form of a web page.\nIt contains text, but also images *.JPG and videos *.MP4\nI would like to make this a file that can be shared with others,\nboth Mac and Windows.  Is there a good way?  Can PDFs contain videos?\nFor example, can I\nconvert it to some \"book\" format that includes JPG and MP4\ndata?\nTextEdit can save in *.rtfd format ... but Windows people won't be able to read it.\nSafari can save as a *.webarchive ... but Windows people are excluded again.\nSafari can export as PDF, but the result does not have working links, nor working videos.\nMicrosoft Word can save in a similar one-file *.mht format, but my experiments\nshow that MP4s don't go through.\nAny suggestions?\n\nA: If you use Cmd + S (or Ctrl + S for windows) on a webpage in most browsers, it will 'save' the contents of the browser as well as (usually) a folder containing style and media information for that page. Then you can open that html file on any computer and it should open in the default browser, displaying whatever of the formatting it was able to save locally.\nIt will not preserve all of the websites functionality, depending on what the website was made with, but it preserves most to all of it.\nDoing this might save your videos as well, depending on how you've embedded the videos.\nThere isn't going to be a one-size-fits all solution for this as web pages can contain an infinite number of media and formatting options which no other form of document (PDF, etc) can hope to replicate.\n(Edit: You could also just host the webpage on some free website hosting platform and share the link)\n\nA: Another possible answer: Convert to an ebook.\nThe most common ebook format is EPUB.  Free apps exist (I used Calibre for my test) to convert from HTML to EPUB-format books.  The resulting ebook played flawlessly on my Mac using the Books app.\nDrawback... The latest version of EPUB (3.2) supports ebooks contining embedded videos.  But most ebook readers do not support 3.2 .  So, if I use this method to distribute to Windows (and other) users, there would be an extra step where the recipient has to get a more recent ebook reader.\n", "Q: Can I create a Smart Folder for vertical videos? I want to create a Smart Folder in Finder that shows videos with height >= width. Is that possible?

The other day, I logged in to a Google account with the YouTube app on iOS. Later, while doing a Google search, I noticed the Google account's profile in the corner, despite me never signing in to this or any Google account on Safari. I deleted all of my Safari's history and it didn't appear to sign me in again, so I re-downloaded the YouTube app and signed in again. Sure enough, Safari somehow recorded those details and signed me in to Google again. As Apple has positioned itself as the \"pro-privacy\" company, I find it very concerning that they are just automatically signing me into Google, despite me very much not wanting that.\nI could not find anything about automatically signing me in to website in Safari, I have auto-fill off and most of the privacy settings enabled. How is this happening, and how can I disable it?\n\nA: YouTube is owned by Google.  When you use a Google app, Google records that information. When you then use a Google web page (e.g. the search engine), the Google code in the web page makes the connection. This is not much to do with Apple - you would see the same thing if you used Chrome as your browser. The purpose is for Google to build a picture of you and target you with adverts.\nI don't think you will get far with just privacy settings in Safari. But I can suggest some steps you can take to reduce your exposure to Google tracking. I can suggest:\n\n*\n\n*Don't use Google and YouTube - which you likely don't want to do!\n\n*For web searches use a privacy focused search engine. Two examples:\n\n*\n\n*DuckDuckGo,\n\n*Startpage which use the Google search engine, but hides your identity.\n\n\n\n*Use an 'ad-blocker' which has strong anti-tracking. I use AdGuard for Mac.\n\n", "Q: Can a Mac \"boot\" from the internet if the recovery partition is absent/corrupted? This is something that has never been clear to me, and I can't find a clear and definite answer by searching the web (rather contradictory information).\nCan a Mac \"boot\" from the internet (with CMD-R or similar combinations) if the recovery partition/volume is absent or corrupted?\nIf yes, it would mean that this is built in the EFI itself? I imagine downloading a minimal system that would fit in a RAM disk.\n\nA: Assuming the Mac is newer than about 2011, it can boot to Internet Recovery.\n Cmd ⌘   Opt ⌥   R  will direct it to Internet Recovery, or it will redirect itself from  Cmd ⌘   R  if there is no usable Recovery partition.\nIt does not boot to a full OS, only sufficient to make repairs or to re-install a full OS.

To Test some features the app has to have the \"ready to submit\" status. Right now it has the \"prepare for submission\" status even tough I uploaded everything mandatory. How do I get to the next status?\nThanks a lot!\n\nA: The status will automatically update when you have all the required information registered.\nFor the software build itself, there's a delay from when you upload it until it has been processed by Apple. You can see the state of the upload in App Store Connect, and you'll also receive an email when it has been processed. This usually takes only a relatively short amount of time (i.e. usually much less than 30 minutes).\nIn addition there's a lot of information you must register about your app. These are all detailed on App Store Connect, so I would suggest simply clicking through the various sub-tabs on the \"App Store\" tab for the app to ensure everything is filled out. This includes such things as:\n\n*\n\n*App name, description, keywords and similar meta data\n\n\n*App icon\n\n\n*Screenshots (note that you need them in various sizes)\n\n\n*Various URLs for support requests, marketing, etc.\n\n\n*Pricing\n\n\n*A privacy policy and filling out the privacy questionnaire\n\n\n*Rating (to determine if there's an age requirement)\n\nA: The one thing I was missing is that you not only have to fill in the information about privacy, but you have to also publish it.\nA way to find out what is missing is to click the \"add to review\" button.

Recently, I noticed that MacOS (Catalina) is running slow. Apps regularly show the spinning rainbow wheel cursor, and video conference apps don't work. I had a load average of over 20, and after quitting all apps, I could only get it down to 16. Normally I see a load average of 1 to 3, even with all my apps open.\nI resorted to rebooting my laptop, costing me hundreds of open windows in several apps.  When the login screen appeared, I SSH'd into it from another machine. Without any graphical logins, the load average was already 13. I couldn't identify any apps that were consuming a lot of resources. There was some daemon that collects data for Spotlight to use, but it was only using 10% CPU according to top.\nAfter logging in locally, the load average is back to 15 with just a couple of terminals running, and I'm already getting the rainbow cursor.\nThere's absolutely nothing suspicious in /var/log/system.log, nor in the output of dmesg.\nMacOS has never worked very well, but it's never been this bad.

Often this is due to either a problem with the disk system (i.e. drive or controller) or lack of proper cooling (i.e. failed fan).\nI would suggest ensuring that you have proper backups, then try to inspect the fans and clean them.

But if I leave the Screen Sharing app (the user session should still be running in background), the script return an error when launched by the calendar event \"Watch me do error : (OSStatus error -50)\". If I do the same, but I schedule the script from the other admin account (the one \"physically\" opened on the computer screen), it runs fine.\nI already set the permissions in Privacy settings to the script.\nIt seems to be a problem of Automator script execution when runned on a \"not on the screen\" user account.\n\nA: Active User Only\nYou are correct, the Automator workflow must run within the currently active graphical user session.\nBackground users, even those with graphical sessions, can not interact with or affect the active graphical session.\nThird Party Tools\nThird party tools, such as Power Manager, are able to help with this task. To do this, the tool must ensure the workflow is launched within the active graphical session. This is typically achieved by using an assisting process within each user session.\nI am an engineer who is involved with Power Manager, so feel free to get in touch about how it works.\n\nWatch Me Do\nYou should be aware that Automator's Watch Me Do task is fragile.

Normally this is done by dragging the file to the edge of the screen and holding it there.  After a short time, the next Space moves into the screen and I can drop the file.  However, when there is an external monitor connected as an Extended Display, this functionality seems to be disabled.\n\nA: Having Displays have separate Spaces checked apparently disables dragging items between Spaces within one display.*  However, I was able to work around as follows:\n\n*\n\n*Hold the mouse button down on the file to be moved.\n\n*While holding the mouse button down, press the Spaces key (F3 on my keyboard).  Available Spaces appear at the top of the screen.\n\n*Drag the file to the desired Space.  Hold it there until the Space fills the screen.\n\n*Drop file where desired.\n\n* I see now that this behavior makes sense.  If you had a second display to the right of your main display, dragging a file to the right edge of the screen should either move it to the second display or to the next Space in the current display, but it's ambiguous which of those should happen.\n", "Q: Strange message when running `python` or `pip` command \"dyld[19439]: rebase opcodes terminated early at offset 1 of 9040 I'm using OSX.

Most likely the extra ping program has not been signed correctly, and thus every attempt at running it will see it killed before doing anything of value.\nI would recommend uninstalling the extra ping program. You can see where it is located by running the command type ping.\nFor now, you can fix the issue by moving /sbin to the front of your PATH.

to this question and all I get is go to restrictions and turn something off. But I can’t find restrictions. How do I delete it?\n\nA: I am filling in the missing gaps so maybe this not the answer you are looking for.\nWhen adding a certain website on your iOS device to the Home Screen it basically becomes an app icon. Therefore, you only have to long press the icon or the home screen itself. If you press the icon you will be presented with a small menu where you can select \"edit home screen\". Now all the app icons start to jiggle, you can rearrange and delete apps (and also this website bookmark) by clicking the small minus sign on the top left corer. If you long pressed the home screen (i.e. the background image) you will immidietaly see the jiggling.\n\n", "Q: How do I change iPad lock screen font I update my iPad (gen 8) to the newest iPad operating system today (iPadOS 16.1) and noticed that Apple has changed the default lock screen font used for the time. I’m not a big fan of the new font is there a way to change it?\n\n\nA: iPadOS does not support lock screen customization as of version 16.1\n", "Q: How do I re-enable iTerm permissions to use AppleScript app control I have some AppleScript, to bulk export URLs and titles of tabs from my browser.\nIt used to work, from iTerm (and Terminal, and Script Editor).\nI keep my terminal as long-running sessions in tmux that survives application restarts.\n\n*\n\n*It no longer works from iTerm, on a slow timeout, it returns ... got an error: Application isn’t running. (-600).\n\n\n*In Terminal, I'm prompted for \"access to control\" the app, and then it works.\n\n\n\n*In Script Editor, it works.\nHow do I re-prompt for appropriate \"application control\" access for iTerm? It's unclear which setting is needed. I already provide \"Full Disk Access\" among others. The existing approval may have started failing after an update to the OS, or after the application underwent an update.\nRelatedly, can I use some System level tool to see all entitlements by application, instead of by entitlement? It's frustrating to try to guess which additional newly created permissions concepts are required to continue using scripting bridge functionality.\n\nI've explicitly upgraded the application, still fails.\nIn hopes of resetting the preferences entitlements-application mapping, I could delete iTerm, install it again, and see if that prompts me again.\n\nA: Because you use a long-running tmux session, it is the parent of your shells, and calls to osascript, so it inherits the macOS security context that was used to start the long-lived tmux server.\nBy opening a new iTerm terminal, parent to bash without tmux intermediation, you can check the current entitlement status.\nYou'll need to kill your tmux server, and restart it from the new, permission-ed iTerm session (or Terminal), and it will allow osascript control of other applications.\n", "Q: Macbook - should bluetooth devices be turned off manually after sleep? I have Macbook Pro M1 2020 and set of bluetooth devices - MX Keys and MX Anywhere 3. I wonder if NOT switching them off causes any problems in macbook sleep or battery drain of logitech devices?\nTypically, I do not switch them off but maybe it would be a good practise in order to preserve battery.\n\nA: Bluetooth's drain on your Mac is negligible, especially compared to everything else using power, and given that you're talking about a mouse and keyboard. Audio devices would use more but even then, it's not much.\nYour M1 Mac is well optimized for battery. The hassle of turning your devices on and off are not worth it. Furthermore, those devices most likely have auto-off or auto-sleep to preserve their own power, which impacts how frequently they're going to poll your Mac.\n", "Q: Charge Macbook pro M1 with Dell 65 W Charger? I forgot my Macbook pro M1 charger and I am traveling for 2 months. I have my work laptop Dell Latitude 7420 which has type c charger of 65 Watt.\nOutput: \n5.0V = 3.0A/15.0W\n9.0V = 3.0A/27.0W\n15.0V = 3.0A/45.0W\n20.0V = 3.0A/65.0W\n\nPlease help.\nRegards,\nSujan\n\nA: As soon as the plug is USB-C, it is compatible. There is no voltage concern, it is a standard.\nThe only concern is the power (in Watts), but is not so important.\n\n*\n\n*If the power of the charger is bigger than the one needed by the computer, no problem.\n\n*If the computer, on the contrary, needs more power than the charger is able to deliver, then the only concern is that the computer will charge slower - and maybe even slower than the power is drained if the computer is used in the same time. In this case, you will need time where the computer charges without being used.\nAlso, the charger may become hotter (and thus wear out quicker) as it is always used at full capacity. So in this case, do not use on a regular basis, just as a spare solution.\n\nConclusion : no problem, use it.\n", "Q: Ignore Ventura upgrade macOS Ventura has not yet been approved by my company.\nHow can I ignore the Ventura upgrade, yet still get minor updates for Monterey?\nI know I managed to do this a couple of years ago...\nAlso preferably with the way to revert this once the upgrade is approved :)\n\nA: In the Software Update Syspref, there will always be a link to select to upload and install earlier macOS updates and such, by clicking the More Info under Other updates are available:\n\n\n", "Q: What does a lock icon with non-usable password entry field instead of login screen mean on a mac?

Under the heading \"Other ways to install Windows 11 (not recommended)\" there is a method which is repeated below.\n\nCreate an image install\nUse DISM or 3rd party tools to directly apply an existing Windows 11 image to the disk.\n\nImportant: An image install of Windows 11 will not check for the following requirements: TPM 2.0 (at least TPM 1.2 is required) and CPU family and model.\n\n\nI have the following related questions:\n\n*\n\n*Is it possible to do a clean install of the current Windows 11 Pro release (Version 22H2) on any of these Macs by using the method above? In other words, reformat the Windows 10 volume and install Windows 11 Pro.\n\n*Will Windows 11 be automatically activated for free?\n\n*Can the install be done with only tools provide by Microsoft and Apple? In other words, without the use of any other 3rd party tools from URLs that are not Microsoft or Apple.\n\n*Does the WDDM driver for Windows 11 (Version 22H2) have to be at least 2.0?\n\n*Does the Mac have to have a Windows 11 (Version 22H2) compatible 64-bit processor?\n\n*Can the latest release of the Windows Support Software (Boot Camp Support Software) provided by Apple for each Mac be used?\n\n\nA: Answers to the Questions\n\n*\n\n*A clean install of the current Windows 11 Pro release (Version 22H2) is possible for all three Macs.\n\n\n*Activation will occur automatically after an administrator account linked to the same Microsoft account used for Windows 10 is added. In other words, Windows 11 can be activated for free.\n\n\n*The install can be done with only tools provide by Microsoft and Apple. No software needs to be downloaded from URLs other than those used by Microsoft and Apple.\n\n\n*I have a machine with Windows 11 Pro installed. The Direct X Diagnostic Tool (dxdiag.exe) reports WDDM 2.0. However, when I use Microsoft Remote Desktop to access the same machine from another machine, the Direct X Diagnostic Tool reports WDDM 1.3. So, I conclude Windows 11 must to some degree be designed to accept a WDDM driver that is less than 2.0.\n\n\n*When dealing with processor compatible issues consider the following. The table below was constructed using Microsoft's Windows Client Edition Processors table and and Apple's websites pertaining to Windows 7, 8.1 and 10.\n\n\n\n\n\niMac (21.5-inch, Mid 2011)\niMac (21.5-inch, Late 2013)\nMac mini (Late 2018)\n\n\n\n\nProcesor\nI5-2400S\nI5-4570S\nI5-8500B\n\n\nCompatible Windows Editions according to Microsoft\nnone\nWindows 10 Enterprise LTSB 1607\nWindows 10 1709 through Windows 11 version 22H2\n\n\nCompatible Windows Editions according to Apple\n32 bit Windows 7 and64 bit Windows 7/8.1\n64 bit Windows 7/8.1/10\n64 bit Windows 10\n\n\nCompatible Windows Home or Pro Editions according to both Microsoft and Apple\nnone\nnone\nAll since model's introduction date\n\n\n\n\nFor both iMacs, there are many Windows editions which Apple states are compatible. Yet, Microsoft states the Mac's processor would not be compatible. From this, I conclude that just because Microsoft states a Mac's processor is not compatible does not absolutely mean Windows 11 Home or Pro editions can not be installed on the Mac.\n\n\n*The latest release of the Windows Support Software provided by Apple for each Mac should used to install Windows 11. In this case, the software is probably different for each of the three Macs. To be sure of using the latest version of the Window Support Software for a given Mac, the software should be downloaded by using the Boot Camp Assistant on the given Mac.\n\nActually, the Windows Support Software for any Intel Mac can be downloaded from Apple by using virtually any machine with OS X, macOS, Windows or Linux installed. However, the procedures for do so are beyond the scope of this answer.\n \nNote: Do to a faulty assumption made by the author Tim Sutton, Brigadier does not always provide the most current version of the Windows Support Software for a given Mac.\n\nInstallation Procedure\nThis procedure makes the following assumptions. If any of these assumptions are not true for your Mac, then post a comment or ask a new question referencing this post.\n\n*\n\n*If Windows uses the UEFI method, then on the drive where Windows is installed, the first partition must be the EFI partition where the Windows boot files are stored. (See below for how to determine the boot method.)\n\n*There is not a separate partition for the Windows Recovery Environment (Windows RE, WinRE or WRE).\n\nThe steps for installing Windows 11 are given below.\n\n*\n\n*Determine the Windows 10 boot method:\n\nNote: Windows 11 should be installed to use the same boot method as Windows 10.\n\nIf the boot method is already know, then proceed to the next step. Windows 10 will be using either a BIOS or UEFI boot method. The method can be confirmed by the location of the BCD file. For a BIOS booting Windows 10, the hidden BCD file can be found in the hidden Boot folder on the NTFS formatted volume labeled BOOTCAMP. This location can be checked from macOS or Windows by using the commands below.\n\n*\n\n*From macOS:\nls /Volumes/BOOTCAMP/Boot/BCD\n\n\n\n*From Windows:\ndir /a:h c:\\Boot\\BCD\n\nIf the BCD file is not found, then the UEFI boot method can be assumed. Or, UEFI booting can be confirmed by verifying the existence of the file EFI/Microsoft/Boot/BCD on the unmounted FAT32 formatted volume in the EFI system partition.\n\n\n*Create an USB flash drive installer: Start by downloading the latest Windows 11 Disk Image (ISO) file. For the example given in this answer, the \"English (United States)\" language was chosen, which resulted in the file Win11_22H2_English_x64v1.iso being downloaded.\n\nNote: Using the Media Creation Tool can result in the download of a different ISO file. This answer was only tested using the ISO file downloaded without using the Media Creation Tool.\n\nAlso, use the Boot Camp Assistant to download the Windows Support Software for your Mac. This should be done from the same Mac where Windows 11 is to be installed. Copy the contents of both downloads to a MBR partitioned, ExFAT formatted USB flash drive labeled W11Install. If there is a file named AutoUnattend.xml, then renamed this file NoAutoUnattend.xml. Below is a macOS High Sierra Finder view of the files and folders in the root folder of this flash drive for the 2011 and 2013 iMacs. (Note: The Windows Support Software for the 2018 Mac mini does not have a file named AutoUnattend.xml.)\n\n\n\n*Open a Command Prompt window:\n\nIf the Mac has a T2 chip, then make sure the Mac is allowed to external boot.\n\nUEFI boot from the USB flash drive, by restarting the Mac and immediately holding down the option key until the Mac Startup Manager icons appear.\n\nNote: To proceed at least the keyboard or mouse needs to work. If both are wireless and fail, then you will need to find at least one working wired keyboard or mouse. If the keyboard only fails, then use an on-screen keyboard. If the mouse only fails, then navigate using the keyboard. Once in Audit Mode you can pair the failed wireless keyboard and/or mouse.\n\nSelect the external drive icon labeled EFI Boot. Proceed with the installation until the window shown below appears.\n\nNote: Reaching this window causes drivers in the $WinPEDriver$ folder to be automatically loaded.\n\n\nNext, select the red button with the white X or press the key combination option+F4. In the popup, select the Yes button. Next, select \"Repair your computer\", \"Troubleshoot\" and \"Command Prompt\", in the order given. This opens a Command Prompt window titled \"Administrator: X:\\windows\\SYSTEM32\\cmd.exe\".\n\n\n*Install a clean Windows 11 Pro from the flash drive:\nThe table below shows the drive letters assume by this answer to be assigned to the following volumes.\n\n\n\n\nLtr\nLabel\nFs\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nC\nBOOTCAMP\nNTFS\nVolume where Windows 10 is installed. Label shown is the default assigned when the Windows Support Software is installed. There also could be a different label or no label.\n\n\nD\nW11Install\nexFAT\nVolume on USB flash drive containing the Windows 11 installation files and folders.\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: If either these volumes on your Mac are assigned different drive letters, then make the appropriate drive letter substitutions when entering the following commands.\n\nEnter the following commands to format drive C: and (if necessary) assign the drive letter S: to the volume in the EFI partition.\ndiskpart\nlist volume\nselect volume c\nformat fs=ntfs label=BOOTCAMP quick\n\n\n*\n\n*If using the UEFI boot method, then enter the following commands.\nselect partition 1\nassign letter=s\n\nEnter the command below to exit the diskpart command.\nexit\n\nEnter the following commands to copy files to drive D:, where Windows 11 is to be installed. Here, /index:6 was used to select the installation of Windows 11 Pro.

From the Mac Startup Manager, select to boot Windows from the internal drive as the default. (In other words, hold down the control key when selecting Windows.) After booting to Windows 11 on the internal drive, enter Audit Mode (by pressing the key combination  control+shift+F3).\n\n\n*Install the Windows Support Software and updates from the internet:\n\nIf there are any unpaired wireless devices (such as a keyboard or mouse), then pair these devices before or after installing the Windows Support Software and rebooting.\n\nOpen D:\\BootCamp\\setup.exe to install the Windows Support Software. When asked, do not restart the Mac. Instead, connect the Mac to the internet and open the Apple Software Update application. Update Apple Software Update before updating any other items. Apple Software Update may need to be updated more than once. When the are no more updates to Apple Software Update, install the other updates, which will probably include one or more updates to Boot Camp. Do not restart the Mac until all updates have been made. Afterwards, restart the Mac. Finally, install all updates (including optional updates) offered by Windows Update, which may require restarting the Mac one or more times.\n\nNote: If the file D:\\NoAutoUnattend.xml exists, then you may elect to examine the file to see if Apple intended to have other files execute before D:\\BootCamp\\setup.exe. When testing this answer, I did not elect to do this.\n\n\n\n*Leave Audit Mode and setup the Mac for the Out-of-Box Experience (OOBE): From the the System Preparation Tool, select the options as shown below, then select the OK button.\n\n\n\n*Finish the installation: Turn on the Mac and followed the instructions. Among other tasks, this step will create your user account.\nActivation\nWindows 10 was activated before installing Windows 11. The result was an automatically activated Windows 11, as shown below.

My intention is for the service to be started whenever I log in with the specific user and for it to stop whenever the user is logged out.\nWhat I've tried to do so far is to unload the system service, remove the .plist from the system directory /Library/LaunchDaemons and to move it to the user directory ~/Library/LaunchAgents after which I attempted loading and registering it for the specific user account.

I am developing a simple tool in C, and am using assertions for testing. Since I upgraded to macOS v13.0, whenever I run my test suite, I get lots of “programme name quit unexpectedly.” dialogue boxes – one for each assertion that failed –, which is quite annoying. Does anybody know whether, and how, those dialogue boxes can be turned off?\nI considered whether this question should go on StackOverflow or here, but ultimately it's about how to disable a macOS dialogue box, not about development; this is just for context. If I'm wrong, I'm happy to ask my question over at StackOverflow instead.\nThe Problem\nThe assertions that fail call abort, which raises an ABRT signal, triggering an abnormal exit and consequently the dialogue.\nFor example:\n$ cc -xc - <<EOF\n#include <stdlib.h>\n\nint main(void) {\n        abort();\n}\nEOF\n$ ./a.out\n\ntriggers\n\nBut one of the things that my test suite is testing for is whether the assertions catch the errors they should be catching; those assertions fail on purpose. So it'd be great if I could disable that dialogue box, preferably only for my test suite or only while testing.\nResearch\nThe manual for abort states that:\n\nThe abort() function causes a report to be generated by\nCrash Reporter. If you wish to terminate without generating\na crash report, use exit(3) instead.\n\nSo there may be no solution.\nI tried defaults write com.apple.CrashReporter DialogType none, which reads as if it would disable the Crash Reporter, but to no avail.\nI also searched the web, but when my search terms include \"Crash Reporter,\" the only advice I get is to disable sharing crash data with Apple (which I already did); and when they don't, whatever advice might be out there is buried under an avalanche of articles on how to keep this-or-that application from crashing.\nNon-solutions\nI suppose, I could re-define assert or catch the ABRT signal and call _exit from the signal handler, but doing either is bad style, and I'd rather not.\n\nA: Download the “Additional Tools for Xcode NN” disk image (the version matching your Xcode installation) from Apple's More Downloads page and start “CrashReporterPrefs.app” in the “Utilities” folder of that disk image.\nHere you can select whether the “Unexpectedly Quit” dialog should be displayed never, for application crashes only, or for all crashes of processes run by the user (including command line processes):\n\nIt seems that changes do not take effect until the user logs out and  in again.\nIf you choose “Basic” or “Server” then execution of the program in the Terminal results in an error message and a non-zero exit code, but no dialog is triggered:\n$ ./a.out \nAbort trap: 6\n$ echo $?\n134\n\n", "Q: Problems with Terminal commands in macOS Ventura Since I upgraded my M1 MacBook Pro to MacOS Ventura 13.0, the Terminal app does not work correctly.\nWhen I type, for example, rm -rf ..., it gets killed as shown in the screenshot below.

This is a series of simulated mouse clicks that mimic what a user would normally have to do to access the Wi-Fi menu and select one of the available networks from the list.\nI do not have Ventura but it appears that the changes that affect Ventura's menu bar UI hierarchy first appeared in Monterey, where the UI layout shows a drastic change from what it was previously in Big Sur, whilst seeming to appear to have remained more-or-less unchanged when comparing Monterey to Ventura.\nto joinNetwork:SSID\n        tell application id \"com.apple.SystemEvents\"\n                tell process \"ControlCenter\" to script WiFiMenuExtra\n                        property parent : it\n                        property WiFiMenuExtra : me\n                        property id : \"com.apple.menuextra.wifi\"\n                        property menu bar : a reference to menu bar 1\n                        property menu bar item : a reference to my menu bar's ¬\n                                first menu bar item\n                        property menu : a reference to (my menu bar item whose ¬\n                                value of attribute \"AXIdentifier\" = my id)\n                        \n                        property window : a reference to window 1\n                        property list : a reference to my window's scroll area 1\n                        \n                        script Networks\n                                property parent : WiFiMenuExtra\n                                property Networks : me\n                                property all : a reference to my list's checkboxes\n                                property selection : a reference to (all ¬\n                                        whose name starts with the SSID)\n                                property one : a reference to item 1 of the ¬\n                                        selection's contents\n                        end script\n                        \n                        property index : 0\n                        property handler : a reference to my [success, ¬\n                                failure]'s item (a reference to my index)\n                        property outcome : missing value\n                        \n                        to wait for UIElement\n                                tell the UIElement to repeat 20 times\n                                        if it exists then return it\n                                        delay 0.5\n                                end repeat\n                                \n                                error \"Timeout.\" from UIElement\n                        end wait\n                        \n                        on failure()\n                                click my menu --close the menu\n                                false\n                        end failure\n                        \n                        on success()\n                                click my menu --close the menu\n                                true\n                        end success\n                end script\n                \n                tell the WiFiMenuExtra\n                        click its menu\n                        wait for the all of its Networks\n                        if not (exists its selection of ¬\n                                Networks) then return ¬\n                                failure()\n                        tell one of its Networks\n                                if the value ≠ 1 then click\n                                get the value * 2 - 1\n                        end tell\n                        set the index to the result\n                        set its outcome to its handler as script\n                        its outcome()\n                end tell\n        end tell\nend joinNetwork:\n\njoinNetwork_(\"WiFiTit?\")\n\nA number of obstacles were encountered that necessitated some unconventional tactics in order to get the above script to work in Monterey, so I wouldn't be surprised if there are some similar unexpected errors that get thrown in Ventura initially.  We can work through any that arise, although it will probably be quite a painful procedure given I don't have access to Venture myself and knowing how meticulous I had to be to implement the above well enough to be reliably stable.  For instance, the reference to the menu bar item had to be filtered using the attribute \"AXIdentifier\" (which in Monterey is \"com.apple.menuextra.wifi\"—this might be different in Ventura), as for some reason, attempting to obtain the reference using its name kept throwing errors, but it took a bit of exploring to find another way in.\nWhat This Script Does\nGiven an SSID, it will open the Wi-Fi menu (which has to be available from the menu bar), and look for a matching Wi-Fi network name under the list of preferred networks.  These are the networks that have previously been joined and marked as networks that may be joined automatically.\nWhat This Script Doesn't Do\nIf the network you want to join is not in the list of Preferred Networks, that's where the buck stops.  There is no UI reference that points to the Other Networks menu item, so there's no way to access those other networks using AppleScript.\n", "Q: M1 / M2 Pro vs Max heat and energy consumption I know this is going to sound ridiculous, but I'm primarily looking at the 16 inch MBP for the larger screen real estate. Granted, I always want my chips to be fastest, etc. but I have a mini-datacenter in my home where I do most of my compute intensive tasks.\nSo here is the question - given that I mostly want to have a large screen with ~16 terminals open to do coding, could bumping up to the Max (M1 or M2) actually hurt me here in terms of heating / power draw? I'd rather sacrifice the performance for the sake of reduced noise / heat / battery if it came to it. However, if the extra cores would just sit there and be 'free' extra compute when I wanted to run something locally I'd be all about it.\nSo will bumping up to the M1 (or M2) Max cause increased heat, noise, or power draw compared to the 'base' chip that would come with a MBP 16 inch?\n\nA: The M1 Max has the same 10-core CPU as the M1 Pro. So there is no difference in performance on that basis.\nThe Max has more GPU cores, of course (as well as twice the memory bandwidth and RAM capacity), so it can perform graphic-intensive processes and handle more data faster.\nSome reports suggest that the Max uses slightly more battery, but that may depend on usage.\nI have the 16\" M1 Pro, and I've yet to find anything that will make the fans move at all!\nIf you're not working in video, nor an environment where every second costs money: I'd suggest the Pro is sufficient.\nThere are no M2 16-inch MBPs at present; though rumours suggest they may be  imminent.

The good thing about the situation is that it's obviously a general problem affecting plenty of people, so I am optimistic there will be a fix eventually.\nAs I didn't want to use Outlook (a bit overblown for a temporary reminder fix), I added my exchange account to Microsoft To Do, which is a small piece of software that is available at no cost on the macOS App Store.\nBTW: delegated Exchange calenders stopped synching after updating to Ventura as well; that problem I was able to fix by completely resetting macOS Calendar and then re-adding the various accounts and delegations.\n--\n[UPDATE] Matteo's solution (thank you!) of completely removing the Exchange account with all its data and then re-adding it worked for me as well. Pretty painful having to download 90K+ email messages again but at least everything is synching as it's supposed to afterwards.\n", "Q: Clamshell Mode fails after macOS Ventura update (Oct'25, 2022) MacBook Air M1 won't connect to the external display (MSI MAG2732) in clamshell mode (power adapter connected to the device with lid off) after updating to macOS Ventura on October 24th (Day of release). I tried to use my updated iPad Air M1 as an external display 2, alongside the monitor as an external display 1. Turns out - after closing the lid, both of the display works! But as soon as the iPad is disconnected, the monitor loses signal (HDMI to USB-c cable).\nI tried clearing/removing NVRAM, caches, and windowserver.plist files inside ~/Library/Preferences (couldn't find windowserver files, so any help on this would be highly appreciated!), and none of them worked. I also installed the macOS in safe mode again, changing the display refresh rate to default in both main and external displays. At this point, none of them seemed to work, and the only way I can use the external monitor is by keeping the lid on.\nI also made sure that the system isn't falling asleep as soon as I turn the lid off. The system is not asleep when I close the lid, the application seems to be working and the external display also seems to be working normally, but no signals!\nUpdate: External monitor seems to work with the lid closed in safe mode. It gets back to not working when restarted.\n\nA: A problem immediately after updating to a new OS, which works normally in Safe mode, usually suggests some third-party background process that is incompatible with the new OS.\nCheck what LaunchAgents, LaunchDaemons and Login Items you are running.\nAnother easy and cheap fix: use a different cable or port.\nI'm not sure why you think WindowServer would affect the connection to the display.\n", "Q: In Software Update under macOS Monterey 12.6.1, why does the macOS Ventura 13.0 upgrade have a plain icon and a nonfunctional \"More Info...\" link? I recently updated an M1 Apple Mac system from macOS Monterey 12.6 (most likely) to 12.6.1. The Software Update window offered the option to upgrade the system to macOS Ventura 13.0, but I went with updating the system to macOS 12.6.1. There was also an update for the Safari Web browser, and I also selected that update. After at least one of the updates was downloaded, there was a period of time where the system was preparing the update or updates and during that time there was Internet connection activity from the system. In the end, the system was updated to macOS 12.6.1.\nYesterday, on this Apple Mac, I opened Software Update shortly after booting up the system and logging in (from what I remember.) It is possible that I opened Software Update by choosing About This Mac from the Apple menu and then clicking the Software Update... button in the About window. Software Update loaded, and from what I remember, at some point, it indicated that macOS Ventura was available. In addition, to the left of the macOS Ventura 13.0 text, there was a round orange and yellow icon, and underneath the macOS Ventura 13.0 text, likely in addition to information about the version and size (in GB) of the upgrade, there was text that said \"More Info...\" or perhaps just \"More Info\". Clicking this text opened a Web browser which loaded a page at the Apple Web site about the macOS Ventura software.\nHowever, when I open Software Update, what is always shown (with the exception of the previously mentioned occasion) is the macOS Ventura 13.0 text and to the left of the text is a more plain icon, like a round shape with \"mac OS\" on it. In addition, though there is \"More Info...\" text, clicking this text does not do anything. Sometimes, the arrow cursor changes into a hand-shaped cursor when placed over the \"More Info...\" text. On a previous occasion, it may have happened where the icon to the left of the macOS Ventura 13.0 text was momentarily shown as being orange and yellow. Also, it may have happened where the area of the Software Update window where the macOS Ventura 13.0 text and the icon and the \"More Info...\" text are displayed has flashed, as if something different was very momentarily displayed.\n(An update on the previous paragraph: I opened Software Update and after checking for updates, it displayed an orange and yellow icon to the left of the macOS Ventura 13.0 text for maybe a second or somewhat less than a second before it displayed the plain round icon instead.)\nDoes anyone know what is causing the plain icon and the nonfunctioning \"More Info...\" text for the macOS Ventura 13.0 upgrade that is offered in Software Update?\n\nA: I have seen this on my device. It is likely a misconfiguration on Apple's software system.\nOne potential cause, if your system shares this with mine - is any intermediate software update servers. If you're at a school or on a workplace network, they may intercept Apple Software Update to allow updates to be cached and save them bandwidth.\nEither way, and regardless, there is no concern here.\n", "Q: Change owner of the home ~ folder from 503 to my user I used to use 2 users: admin and user for work.

Just type it in and you're all set. If you want to bill iTunes to a virtual debit/credit card number, just enter it into the iTunes account details.\n", "Q: iPadOS 16 cant update apps, itunes account disabled A long time ago, my ipad had a separate apple id (for icloud/messages) & itunes account (for app store). That year, I signed out of the itunes account & logged into the app store with my main apple id (i had no purchases, so i didnt lose anything). It worked fine till yesterday. Yesterday, I updated to ipados 16. Various forums reccomended updating all apps after upgrading the OS. So i went to update my apps. Surprisingly, clicking on one asked for an apple id password dialog (but a much smaller one, not a purchase or sign-in dialog). It reminded me of the old itunes dialog. I entered my password for my apple id, and it said incorrect. I clicked reset password, and it autofilled the email to be that of my old, unused itunes account. I entered the Old itunes account password to enter my account to updates.\nI wanted to get rid of this account, so I went to appleid.apple.com, removed the ipad from the account. Then i went to privacy.apple.com & requested deletion of my old itunes account.\nI havent recieved confirmation that the account is fully deleted (obviously, it took 30 days last time), but now I get this error when updating apps. I can't find a trace of the account or how to remove it from the ipad.\n\nI can still download new apps just fine - i just give my biometrics & it is done. I can also download apps i previously purchased just fine.\n\nA: Unfortunately, you cannot transfer purchases (even free downloads) from one Apple account to another. It has been asked on Apple's forums: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/7613529\nThe workaround I found was to use Family sharing to share your purchases with your new account: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207937\nAlternatively, you can delete the apps and re-download using your new account. If those apps store data in the cloud using non-apple account (e.g. Google login), you'll keep your data.\n", "Q: How to use Use F function keys as Control Strip Default Set in MBP Touch Bar In the MBP touch bar, I have selected the use of F function key rows for the touch bar.

I want to change the cell fill color on one sheet depending if there is a match of information from another sheet. Here is what I am looking for:\nIf the P# in Sheet 1 matches the P# in Sheet 2 I want to change the cell fill color in Sheet 1 to be yellow.\n\nI would use either the \"Player\" name or \"P#\" for the match, whichever would be easier to implement.  I hope that makes sense.  At present when any Player (P#) is selected in Table 1 I manually change the cell fill color in Table 2.\nRight now when I enter the P# 1 in Sheet 2 it autofills the Player Name into the sheet. I want to be able for the cell in Sheet 1 to be yellow if there is a match either with the P# or the Player Name (whichever is easier to match) from Sheet 2.\n\n\nA: Unfortunately, conditional highlighting in Numbers (Format->Conditional Highlighting) is not that sophisticated as of yet: a Numbers cell can be color-highlighted automatically only based on its own value.\nIf you really wish to have automatic coloring for a cell based on the values of other cells, albeit indirectly, one of the things you can do is, first, to add a column, for example, next to the column with the cells you wish to be compared with. Then, fill the cells in the new column with a formula, for example, yielding boolean values (True/False) based on the cell values to be compared with each other. Finally, use the options in Format->Conditional Highlighting to create a conditional highlighting rule which would include both the fill and font colors.\nThe screenshot below shows a simple example. If a cell in the A column has the same value with the cell at the same row in the B column, then the cell at the same row in the C column takes the value of TRUE. Otherwise, it takes the value of FALSE. Because I had a narrow column in this example, I chose bright green for both the fill and font colors.\n\n", "Q: How to read microstackshots file?

If it doesn't work even with RDM (doesn't show up in RDM menu), it is probably a dock limitation.\nI've had good luck with RDM for seeing unexposed resolutions so it might work for you.\n\nA: You can try BetterDisplay (https://github.com/waydabber/BetterDisplay) to show more resolutions:\n\nConvert your internal and natively connected external displays to smoothly-scaled HiDPI displays on Apple Silicon - now even without mirroring a dummy (displays with notch, HDR, HDCP, high refresh rate fully supported)! *\n\nAlso, I'd verify the specs of the dock to see what the HDMI port can output.\nThen I'd check the HDMI cable to confirm the version to make sure it can support a 2k or 4k resolution.\n", "Q: Using Apple ID as login method - Can the App Developer track you, if you delete your account and re-do this? Let's say an iOS app lets you use your Apple ID as your login method, and you create an account this way.\nI suppose they don't get your APPLE ID, bur rather some scrambled, right?\nThen, if you delete the account you just created on the app, and re-create a new account, using the same Apple ID, can the app developer figure that it is you again?\nIf not, why, is it because the scramble changed each time?\nAnd what if you had a \"subscription\" when creating the first account, and you \"recover\" it while using the second account, can the app developer figure it's you in that specific case?\n\nA: There are two things in play here - I believe you're referring to Sign in with Apple but I've mentioned the other one for completeness.\nSign in with Apple\nSIWA emails cannot be reset, just disabled/re-created. If you delete it from Settings > Apple ID > iCloud > Hide My Email > [Select the Account] > Manage Settings > Stop Using Apple ID the account will clear out and the email will stop working, but it may return in the future.\nSince Sign in with Apple doesn't require installing the app, there is no connection between having the app or not having it, to the SIWA association.\nCloudKit Account ID\nDevelopers also have the option of getting an Apple ID account identifier that is unique to that app. You can usually reset this data by finding the app in your iCloud storage tab and deleting the data associated with it.\n", "Q: Terminal command no longer working after upgrading macOS to Ventura I have a simple command to open a new instance of the downloads folder in the Finder, but it does not work under macOS Ventura:\nopen -n ~/Downloads\n\nwhich returns\nThe application cannot be opened for an unexpected reason, error=Error Domain=RBSRequestErrorDomain Code=5 \"Launch failed.\" UserInfo={NSLocalizedFailureReason=Launch failed., NSUnderlyingError=0x6000032c54d0 {Error Domain=NSPOSIXErrorDomain Code=153 \"Unknown error: 153\" UserInfo={NSLocalizedDescription=Launchd job spawn failed}}}\nuser@MacBook-Air-Name ~ % \n\nI have not changed the folder structure at all.

The Studio is running macOS 12.6.1, but for the past month or two so (starting when it was running 12.5 or 12.6), I’ve been noticing an odd issue. (The Mac mini is still on Catalina and has never had the issue. My MacBook Pro is on 12.6.1 as well and also does not have the issue.)\nThe issue is that at seemingly random times, perhaps once or twice a day, my System Preferences will suddenly open on its own (or if it’s already open in the background, jump to the front) and interrupt whatever I’m doing at the time.\nIt always opens to the same view, namely Extensions → Finder Extensions:\n\nIt always looks exactly like this: the OneDrive extension is not enabled, but there’s a little blue dot next to it (like it’s newly installed?).\nI do have Office 2019 installed, but I have never knowingly installed anything to do with OneDrive, which I don’t use – and of course, I’m not even sure the OneDrive extension actually has anything to do with this to begin with.\nI haven’t been able to identify any common denominators at all when this happens. It’s happened while using an Internet browser, InDesign, VSCode, Excel – and it also happens when I’m not even at the computer at all.\nWhat could be causing this odd behaviour? And how can I get rid of it.\n\nA: I have the same issue and from your screenshot it seems we only have the Google Drive extension in common. So I disabled auto-start for Google Drive and closed it.\nNow I can reproduce the issue: every time I start Google Drive manually, the system prefs dialog comes up again, which seems to confirm it is causing this behaviour. It's probably triggering the system prefs dialog also every time it checks for updates or so.\nI do not have a solution to fix this, though. I just keep Google Drive off by default, not using it much anyway and probably even less in the future...\n", "Q: Want to listen to ALL my Compact Discs via iPad Ok, here goes!\nI’m an old guy with limited computer skills but lots of music that I like listening to on my home stereo system. This is what I would like to do:\nI love my iPad Air 3. It’s all I got computer wise and over 300 hard earned purchased CDs. I want to listen to all this music via my iPad. Touch something on the screen and it plays the music I have OFFLINE.\nI know I will need a computer/laptop, an external dvd player, and an external storage device. Everything else I read that I might need is quite confusing to me. Don’t use iTunes, need this storage device, use this player, and onwards.\nTMI for me! I don’t want to stream. Just listen to what I have. Willing to pick up a apple laptop to hopefully make all this easier.\nSimple solutions would be best for me. Any suggestions for us newbies? Thanks a bunch!\n\nA: What you really need is iTunes [or the newer Apple Music, but that won't actually help… read on…].\nThe reason you need iTunes is that's the only way to get the music onto the iPad. The iPad can't play the actual CDs, of course.\nSo, you want an old Mac (or a PC, but hey, we're all Mac fans here ;) one with a CD/DVD drive. This is going to be maybe 10 years old or so (& therefore cheap;). Modern ones don't have optical drives any more, though you can get external ones… maybe too much faff if all you want is a machine to enable your transfers.\nOlder Macs still use iTunes [that's why you don't need to care about Apple Music which replaced iTunes]\nOnce you run iTunes, you can feed it CDs one at a time & bring them all into iTunes.\nYour Mac will need to be able to see an internet connection whilst it's doing this, to get the album & track titles & the artwork. [These are not on the CD at all, it uses some smart recognition software to 'guess' what the album is.]\nYou can then sync these to your iPad & carry your entire CD collection wherever you go.\nI found a pictorial guide to the actual process - they used a PC but the method is the same - https://www.copytrans.net/support/how-to-import-cd-tracks-to-itunes/\nAs a bonus - the Mac will also now contain all your CDs, giving you two means of playback.\nNote: This is all a bit complex to run the entire procedure in a few paragraphs.

I don't remember the exact year.\nIt has a Dual-Core Intel Core i5 processor at 1.6GHz. It used to have High Sierra version then I upgraded it to Monterey 12.6.0 just few days ago.\nIt started all good with Monterey but now started lagging ever since I installed the 12.6.1 update.\nI tried updating it to version 12.6.1 but it seems to get stuck at 15 minutes remaining. Not really getting through the update.\nHow to fix the lagging issue of MacOS 12.6.0? Is this one of those planned obsolescense?\n\nA: Is this one of those planned obsolescence?\nNo. If you Mac is supported by a new OS, then it should work, and it should work well. (If Apple can't get an OS to run well on a Mac model, then they exclude it from the OS.)\nProblems after upgrading are often caused by third-party software that is incompatible with the new OS. It may need upgrading, or removing.\nJumping several 'years' in one go is more likely to make this happen.\nI would recommend using an app like EtreCheck, which provides you with a report of all the software that might affect system performance. You can then check whether you need everything it lists, or whether it needs updating to a newer version.\nhttps://etrecheck.com/en/index.html\nYou can post the report here, in your question, if you'd like. It does not contain any identifying or unique information.\n\nA: Try restarting into Safe Mode, then booting again normally.  This will flush various caches and is always a good troubleshooting step.\nThen open System Preferences > Users & Groups, and try removing all entries from the Login Items section.  Log out and log back in and see if the lagging behavior persists.\n", "Q: Any systematic way to switch between windows in MacOS? I am using Mac for a year now, but still didn't figure out if there is any systematic way to switch between windows here?\nObviously it is not possible to use Command-TAB all the time as in Windows. For example, if I have opened two text documents in Word and two another text documents in Writer, I need to remember, in which application they were opened and use Command-TAB or Command-BackQuote depending on the parameters of the planned switch.\nBut this is complicated for some applications, because, for example, Command-BackQuote does not work for Google Chrome. So if I have two documents in Word, two documents in Writer, one page in Chrome in one profile and one page in another, I need to choose between Command-Tab, Command-BackQuote and Control-Arrows. Moreover, Control-Arrows don't behave in predictable manner and often I need to seek window for some time.\nNext complications arise if several monitors are connected. Sometimes it makes window switching just impossible. Sometimes Command-Tab can show window in the list, show it switched to it, but window doesn't appear.\nIs there any consistent and understandable model of windows behavior in macOS?\n\nA: To have more Windows-like experience:\n\n*\n\n*use application switcher (⌘+⇥) to navigate between open applications\n\n*to see all open windows of selected application press ↑ (arrow up) or ↓ (arrow down)\n\n*minimized windows of selected app are displayed on separate ribbon at the bottom of the screen\n\n*move between app windows using arrow keys, select appropriate and press ⏎ to bring it front/activate\n\n*to cancel app window selecting press ␛\n\n*to cancel app window selecting and move to next application press ⇥\nHowever, this will not work over Spaces. Reason being that Spaces are meant to separate app windows. From documentation:\n\nIf the desktop on your Mac gets cluttered with open app windows, you can use Mission Control to create additional desktops, called spaces, to organise the windows. When you work in a space, only the windows that are in that space are shown.\n\nThere are several settings in System Preferences/Settings which may impact user experience. Under Desktop & Dock > Mission Control there are \"Group windows by application\", \"Displays have separate Spaces\", \"When switching to an application switch to a Space with open windows for the application\" etc.\nIt's always good idea to define the problem with precision. In case of Chrome it's probably not switching between app windows. Most likely it's actually how to navigate to any/needed open Chrome tab with ease. For that I suggest Raycast with Chrome extension. You can navigate to any open tab regardless of Space in which Chrome window is open without rising your hands from keyboard. Even if you have only faint idea about the name/content of the tab you are looking for it shouldn't take more than like two seconds to find it.\n", "Q: How to upgrade to specific macos version I have macOS 11.6 and would like to upgrade to 12.6, but newer macos 13.0 was released and I'm unsure how to get to upgrade to 12 Monterey anymore.

My notes also contain some images I've cut and pasted from the screen capture feature on the iPad.\nI'd simply like to export my notes to PDF to share them.\nAs noted in this old post, exporting a note from iPad \"cuts off\" the handwritten text across pages.\nA proposed solution is to print the note from Notes.  This seems to work ok for simple handwritten notes.\nHowever, if the note contains an image, the result is extremely weird: the handwritten text is flipped both horizontally and vertically. Leonardo da Vinci would probably love this, but I find it very annoying. In addition, the handwritten text below an image is moved to the next page and it often gets cut off anyway.\nDoes this happen to anyone else?\nIs there a reasonable workaround? I'd be happy even with a PDF containing a single very long page (kind of like a \"scroll\").\n\nA: I have the same issues. Exporting handwritten notes from ipad to pdf only exports one page (cuts off the rest). Exporting pdf notes with mixture of handwritten notes and photos does the weird inversion thing.\nMy labourious workaround is to share the note as a picture (.png).\n", "Q: Numbers: Can you write text to a cell with a formula?

See https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/security/secd698747c9/web for more info on the SSV. It's there to prevent the system being tampered with.\nYou can check whether a folder is in the SSV by using diskutil apfs list to display all the APFS volumes, and noting which ones are tagged as sealed. Generally there will be one volume's snapshot mounted at / which is sealed. Unsealed volumes such as /System/Volumes/Data will be the ones where user modifiable data reside.\nYou can check where a particular folder is by eg. :\n% cd /usr/bin\n% df ./\nFilesystem     512-blocks     Used Available Capacity iused      ifree %iused  Mounted on\n/dev/disk3s1s1 1942700360 17243704 220253880     8%  348619 1101269400    0%   /\n\n% cd ../local \n% df ./   \nFilesystem   512-blocks       Used Available Capacity iused      ifree %iused  Mounted on\n/dev/disk3s5 1942700360 1689972040 220245304    89% 2814601 1101226520    0%   /System/Volumes/Data\n\nAs suggested in the comments, a better practice is to create the symlink somewhere else in the $PATH, such as /usr/local/bin, that should be there by default and is included exactly for this purpose.\n% cd /usr/local/bin\n% ln -sf /usr/bin/my_random_binary random_binary_linked\n\n", "Q: Can I download MP3, MP4, WAV files to the iPhone and play them from Files?

Is the Files app the means of doing that?\n\nA: If you use iCloud you can use the website https://www.icloud.com/iclouddrive/ and upload your files to the Documents folder. They will then appear in the Files app on your iPhone, and any media supported by iOS should be playable from there.\nAs everyone gets 5GB free anyway with their Apple ID, this is probably the most painless way to transfer files.\nNote, you can't transfer music into the Music app from there.

Still, the questions remain: why/how does it matter, being logged in the GUI, for some commands to work.\n\nA: It's apparently implementing the same check that would allows dummy to use the Sleep command in the Apple menu -- anyone who is logged into the GUI is allowed to perform certain actions.\nRather than check whether the command is coming from the GUI itself, it just checks whether the user who runs the command is also logged into the GUI. Even if their GUI is suspended due to fast user switching, it still allows the dummy user to execute the command.\nEven if pmset didn't allow this, you could achieve the same thing with an AppleScript that clicks on the Sleep menu item.\nThe general idea is that someone who has physical access to the machine is allowed some additional privileges without having to re-authenticate or use sudo. Logging into the GUI indicates that you have physical access.\nOther things you can do without having to re-authenticate are the Restart and Shutdown commands in the Apple menu (unless there are other users logged in, then it asks for the admin password). I don't know what the CLI equivalents are (other than the traditional Unix shutdown command), so I don't know if they also implement similar bypass of sudo.\n", "Q: What app icon is this?

I have an app installed on my iPhone which has now been removed from the app store. Is there a way I can transfer it from my iPhone to a Mac as a ## Heading ##.ipa file? I remember some sort of way to do this with apple configurator but I cannot find the tutorial.\n\nA: You can't get the file with configurator, only add it.\nTo get the file to the Mac in the first place, you need an old version of iTunes that still has the App Store in it to pull them from an existing iPhone/Pad. They used to be transferred to the Mac as part of a regular sync.\nYou can still get 12.6.3 direct from Apple via this link - courtesy of OSXDaily - Get iTunes 12.6.3 with App Store for Mac and Windows\nThis is going to come with its own set of problems. I doubt it will run on anything newer than Mojave. It was designed for El Capitan iirc. You'll likely need to fire up a VM to do this if you're on a current macOS. I still have the structure in place from last time I did this a few years ago, but I don't currently have iTunes 12.6.3 to test. 12.6.3 is also incompatible with newer iTunes/Music Libraries, which is another good reason to want to air-gap this in a VM.\nThere may also be issues with it recognising newer phones - again, I can't test this.\nOnce you have the .ipa, then you can quite easily add it from Configurator 2. Connect the phone, right click its representation, Add > Apps… select the file & it will copy it straight across to the phone…\n\n\nThe file path to your .ipa files is inside your iTunes folder. Mine is customised to an external iTunes Library folder, so I'm not certain of the default - /Volumes/OhDaSpace/iTunes_Remote/Mobile Applications/\n", "Q: Is there a commandline switch for \"ls\" that reveals \"firmlinks\" With macOS Sierra APFS came with a new concept of \"firmlinks\", often described as being \"between hardlinks and symlinks\".\nSeveral folders are now at System/Volumes/Data but are firmlinked to locations in the root of the filesystem.

He covers firmlinks in some detail (although, as you observe, firmlinks appeared earlier) and also links to a Bombich article on the same.\nThere is some 'magic' using /usr/share/firmlinks which describes which firmlinks are present. And Oakley's article mentions /etc/synthetic.conf which can be used by users to create their own, and further link to a relevant article.\nhttps://eclecticlight.co/2020/01/23/catalina-boot-volumes/\nhttps://bombich.com/kb/ccc5/working-apfs-volume-groups\nhttps://derflounder.wordpress.com/2020/01/18/creating-root-level-directories-and-symbolic-links-on-macos-catalina/\nAs /usr/share/firmlinks only lists a limited number from the OS install, while possible to have a script merge the output of ls with the list is possible, it would be a bit pointless and static, with the exception of what the user has implemented in /etc/synthetic.conf. But again there, one would expect the user to have recollection of its contents.\n", "Q: How can I quickly make display switch between a MacBook and a Windows laptop? I originally had my work Dell laptop connected to 2 x monitors via a USB-C into one and the Display Port from monitor 1 to the other. This set up was fine for 1 x laptop but I bought a new MacBook Pro for personal use the only way to get it working with the dual monitors was the USB-C into a Thunderbolt and the other monitor connected to the MacBook via the HDMI which all works, but isn't easy to swap from the Dell over the MacBook.\nCan anyone suggest either an easier way to daisy chain the monitors with one connection to the MacBook, or a switch I can connect the monitors to and then plug either laptop into with one connection?\n\nA: Apple does not support MST (multiple stream transport) in DisplayPort so daisy-chained monitors will not work without considerable effort.  This is a software limitation, Apple hardware has all the electronics to make it work but Apple didn't include the software to turn it on.\nPerhaps you could load an operating system on the Apple laptop that supports MST (Windows or Linux) and then run MacOS in a virtual machine.  This is not exactly trivial to set up, and running two operating systems at the same time would impact the computer performance.\nAn external Thunderbolt GPU with multiple display support would give a one cable connection to multiple displays.  This might be considered an overkill solution given the cost.  These are typically just called an \"eGPU\", they are Thunderbolt docks that contain their own graphics processor, and often other functions one would expect from a dock such as supplying power, USB ports, and perhaps Ethernet.  These are for people seeking high performance video, that's why they can fetch a high price.  This is not supported on newer Apple Silicon systems, it works very well on Intel MacOS computers though.  Finding any eGPU that supports both MacOS and Windows may be difficult.\nThere are cheaper USB docks with a GPU, but not much cheaper than the Thunderbolt options.  The good thing though is they are far more likely to support MacOS and Windows.  These USB based GPUs are very low performance since USB isn't exactly optimized for video.  A popular brand for this is DisplayLink (not to be confused with DisplayPort).  DisplayLink docks do appear popular among those not terribly concerned with video frame rates.  DisplayLink does have drivers for Apple Silicon MacOS systems.  DisplayLink is the chip in the dock, the docks with these chips are available from a number of manufacturers in all kinds of varieties.  If the goal is multiple display support then double check that the specific dock supports multiple displays since not all DisplayLink docks have this feature.\nA dual display KVM switch might be what you are looking for.  You'd still need a dock or set of adapters on each laptop to connect to the KVM switch but once plugged in then switching the displays and accessories would be a push of a button.  The reason you'd need a dock is because nearly every KVM switch is built for desktop computers, and they will have dedicated ports for the displays and such.  Maybe there are KVM switches available to switch between laptops, in that they have an integrated dock, but I have not seen one advertised for some time.\nI suspect none of these options are particularly attractive.  You have two different laptops, running different operating systems, with two different sets of ports available.  Finding a solution that makes both laptops \"happy\" is going to be difficult.\n", "Q: How to open app in recovery mode? When I was in recovery mode to change a password I forgot, I got distracted by trying to open an app in recovery mode.\nI tried /Volumes/Macintosh\\ HD/Applications/Google\\ Chrome/Contents/MacOS/Google\\ Chrome, but I got this result:\nKilled: 9.\nI am running on a 2018 15-inch macbook pro. My OS is currently macOS Monterey.\n\nA: Recovery is not a full operating system. It's not designed to be able to run apps - nor is it capable of doing so. It can only run apps/utilities designed specifically to run in that environment.\nAs such, it can run a limited version of Safari, specifically designed to run in such circumstances.\nAround a decade or more ago [2010-ish], a determined hacker managed to get a fully bootable running copy of Snow Leopard and a good collection of Mac 'fixit' tools onto a 4GB USB stick [Snow Leo 911 Pro for those who remember back that far]. As far as I'm aware, it's never been done since. With the advent of Internet Recovery, SSDs & fast external drives it no longer seems worth the effort. Tech Tool Pro can now also make this type of recovery drive as a hidden partition on any disk, to which you can manually add tools.\n", "Q: Using Windows 10 as only operating system on MacBook Air I recently installed Windows 10 on my MacBook Air (early 2015) with Boot Camp, and Windows lags a lot on it.\nI thought of deleting macOS completely to see if Windows will run smoothly, is it a good idea?

There is already a thread asking whether MagSafe1 chargers can be used interchangeably.  However, having gone through all answers, and asked in the comments, I found that not a single person reported using a higher-wattage adapter on a lower-wattage MacBook successfully.\nOrdinarily there should be no problem using a higher-wattage adapter, since the computer would only draw the amount of watts it needs (see the highest-rated answer there) -- but Apple thinks differently.  They designed their higher-wattage adapters not only to supply more watts, but also to supply more volts to the computer.  For example, the 45W Magsafe1 adapter supplies 14.5V, whereas the 85W Magsafe2 adapter supplies a whopping 20V (!).  And in most cases, unless the port is specifically designed for the higher voltage, 3V over the spec is enough to fry the power port of the computer.\nThe accepted answer on that page quotes Apple as saying that we can use a higher wattage power adapter, but we cannot use one with less wattage without potential operating issues.  However, this page has since been removed.  I called Apple to ask about it, had to get transferred to a supervisor, and he hinted that Apple removed that statement because they did not wish to have liability to people whose power ports have burned up.\nHowever, the one thing the supervisor did not answer is, how likely is it for a power port to burn up because a higher-watt charger burned up.  I bought a couple of the 20V adapters without realizing they'd be at a different voltage, and I am afraid to hook them up to my 14.5V MacBook Air.  However, the supervisor said that this is a question for the Engineering -- but Engineering support is not available for hardware which is no longer supported.  Makes sense.  But now to get the answer I have to ask the question here.\nHas anyone heard of an 85W adapter successfully being used on a MacBook Air?\n\nA: This is really already covered in the linked QA, so to simplify it right down as far as possible…\nGeneral rule: Voltage must match. If the Voltage & polarity matches, the Amperage can be a variable.\nHigher than spec is better, because Amps are 'pulled' by the device not 'pushed' by the charger. This is 100% safe, 100% of the time.\nLower than spec, the device can potentially 'pull too hard' for the charger, causing overheat, whilst under-charging the device.\nThe definition of Watts is Volts times Amps.\nA lot of this is obviated by USB-C, which is a 'smart' structure. It can negotiate its power requirement.\n\nA: Yes, this is possible.  The power port has been rated to withstand the higher voltage, so even though the apple.com page has been taken down, the rating remains.\nHowever, using a higher-power adapter does lead to the battery charging more quickly, which puts more strain on the battery, leading it to wear out more quickly.  Alex King experimented with using an 85W adapter on a MacBook Air, and after only 7 months and 174 cycles, the battery capacity went down to 63%.\nIn other words, the recommendation is not to do it unless there is a reason the original adapter is not powerful enough (as is the case here, because the battery is drawing more power than the adapter can provide).\n\nA: As long as it is delivering it via USB-C, it is safe to use an adapter delivering higher wattage than the one coming with the MacBook according to the \"Identify your Mac power adapter\" Apple support webpage (italicization & bolding is by me):\n\nIf your Mac uses USB-C to charge, you can charge your Mac laptop with any USB-C power adapter or display. For the best charging experience, you should use a power adapter or display that provides at least the minimum wattage of the power adapter included with your MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, or MacBook.\n\n", "Q: stop asking I trust this computer My OS version 12.5.6, and my windows 10\nCan I really trust my computer so I do not get the message each time I plug it ??\n\nA: The 'interesting' things are still not accessible ;)\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202778\n", "Q: Airplay to Apple TV with Bluetooth speakers doesn't work My Apple TV uses Bluetooth speakers that play normal Apple TV sounds. When I use an app to send AirPlay to the tv, there is no sound.\nHowever if I use mirroring sound to the Apple TV via bluetooth speakers works fine.\nIs this supported or is there a fix?\n\nA: Is the Apple TV the only device connected to the Bluetooth speaker? If not you will likely run into issues, especially if the phone that you're going to be streaming over airplay is connected, it might try and double up and confuse the speaker so you should forget the speaker on all devices except for the Apple TV.

I backed up photos through the Move to iOS app from Android to iOS.\nIn the android all the 3k+ photos were organized in folders. Unfortunately now it's all in the recent album.\nHow do I organize the album, photos in different albums and preferably in different folders too ?\nFor some reasons the photos can't be sorted by date or locations.\nI want to keep only 1 copy of the photo, so that after moving the photo from the recent album to the new album, it does not appear and does not exist in the recent album.\n\nA: It is helpful to think of Albums in iOS Photos, not as physical folders, but as organisational tags. The Recents album is special in that it lists photos added in order of their import, not necessarily in the order of their creation. A photo will always be in the Recents album. This is useful when adding photos from other sources other than the camera. However the Recents Album is not the primary view you have to work with.\nIf you use the Library tab, from the bottom control bar, you will see photos sorted by their creation dates, and you can also summarise by year, month, day, or view all continuously.\nWhen the iPhone has had a chance to process the files you can view photos sorted by location (where they contain location data of course), and lots of other categories besides, by selecting them in the Albums tab, again in the bottom control bar.\nAs to your previous folder structure, it is unfortunate that that has not been translated as you migrated. Unfortunately I can't advise on why that happened, having never migrated from Android. You may have to recreate your  previous folder structure as Albums in Photos.\nNote, as I said earlier that Albums are more of an organisational tag, a photo can be added to more than one Album at a time. This is useful if a photo merits being in more than one Album at a time, say holiday snaps & dogs you saw on holiday, but note, it does not duplicate the photo, you do not waste space by doing so.\nSome time spent familiarising yourself with the interface will present all these things to you in time. Be sure to read the iOS User Guide.\n", "Q: csshX not working in Ventura I upgraded to Ventura this weekend, and now csshX won't run.

When I am not in the office, I can use the Apple's application Screen Sharing to connect to the iMac through my MacBook Pro.\nIn the \"Sharing\" panel of the iMac settings I have just \"Screen Sharing\" selected, and I allow just administrators to connect. Then, I just have to copy the vnc string I find in the same folder inside the Screen Sharing application, insert the credentials of the iMac, and it works.\nYou can have a look at the Sharing panel in my settings. It's from here that I get the vnc path to connect to the iMac.\n\nTHE PROBLEM:\nI have another laptop, a MacBook Air, that is at home, connected to  my personal router. If I am on a different network, always with my MacBook Pro, and I try to use Screen Sharing in the same way to connect to the MacBook Air, it doesn't work. For this second computer, the Screen Sharing App works only if I am on the same network of the MacBook Air.\nQUESTIONS:\n\n*\n\n*Does anyone know what are the difference between the two computers and why I can connect to the iMac and not to the MacBook Air? Thanks in advance for your help!\n\n\n*In case it's not possible to do that through the use of the vnc, maybe it can be done by specifying the Apple ID, but in that case someone on the other side should accept my request to control the screen. Is there a way to do it automatically?\n\nA: Partial answer, to work on. Far too long for comments…\nThat VNC address will be a local subnet address,  192.168.x.x or maybe 10.x.x.x etc. The address is not valid from outside your network - or more specifically, it's an address not specific to you, personally, but owned by several billion people around the globe, all behind routers too. Your router knows who your are, when you access the outside world using a process known as NAT (Network Address Translation).\nOne simple aspect of NAT is if you make a connection from inside, it knows who you are & gives permissions liberally. If you try to hack your way in from the outstide… it's not going to let you without some very specific permissions & routing set up just for that one computer.\nYour IT department would have to set this up for every user; using one of several [not important to us right now] methods.\nThis is not going to happen, for obvious reasons.\nThe advantage of using the Apple ID is it uses the remote computer's existing known presence on the internet. To the end user, this is similar to how such as TeamViewer, LogMeIn, etc work. It uses established connections initiated from inside the network so already has permission to punch through the firewall. The router sees this as an outbound connection & doesn't prevent it, or need to route it in any 'special' way.\nI've only ever done this using the Apple ID, which manages to accurately locate my father-in-law half a country away.\nApple's Help page on Screen Sharing doesn't really seem to mention this method. When I do this to remote to my father-in-law's Mac, it's the only Mac with his Apple ID, so that's all I type in the connect to box. He has to be present to allow the connection - I've never seen the connect perms box; maybe there's a permanently allow, idk.\nAlso, because I'm connecting to an ID other than my own, nothing is going to confuse which Mac I mean. If you're trying to connect to yourself, this is perhaps going to be different.\nWithout being able to test this myself, I'd suggest trying to do this when you have both computers in the same room, on campus. Tether your 'home' Mac to a phone, so you're using the phone's internet connection, not the local one. This will put you in a random 'foreign' network, allowing you to see & interact with both computers as the connection initiates.\n\nA: I don't know if it can be considered a real answer, but I wanted to post it here because in this way it might help someone else who is experiencing my  same problem.\nFrom the App Store I bought the application Screens 4 for 29 €. It works like a charm. I can control every computer I want, even if they are on different networks.

Since Apple has decided to replace iTunes by the Music app, I'm having problems with my ringtones. In iTunes, it was possible to select the type \"Ringtone\" for these, but now there is only one type \"Music\" (under Info > Options > Media type dropdown).\nBecause of this, whenever I play all titles, the Music app also plays the ringtones, which is something I definitely don't want to have.\nThe Music app is obviously not intended to manage ringtones as iTunes did, but what is the replacement for this then?\nIs there any way to solve this?\n\nA: The short answer is to remove the ringtones from Music so they are not played in future.\nThis then begs the question of how then are ringtones managed between computer and iOS device? For macOS they are added via the Finder directly to the phone, and for Windows it seems iTunes is still the method.\nThe best writeup I've found is this Howto Geek article which covers the changes since iTunes changed to Music in Catalina.  https://www.howtogeek.com/469085/how-to-add-custom-ringtones-to-an-iphone-from-macos-catalina/\nBriefly, the duration is edited, the format exported to AAC, the extension changed to .m4r, and then the file is copied into the iOS device.\nI've tested this with Music 1.3 on Ventura 13.0 and transferring the file to iOS 16.1. Works fine.\nThe split of the various media types that iTunes used to support is most evident with ringtones, Audiobooks and Podcasts. Whereas the latter two are significant enough to warrant their own management apps, ringtones are (though minor) obviously a source of revenue enough to make Apple leave the default management method to iTunes Store purchases for the casual user.\n", "Q: Is there exist an higher level account than administration user in macos? I'm holding a borrowed mac book, and I have created an admin account that can use Sudo and create new users, but in the system there exists another real admin account that I cannot reset the password with my current admin account. And when I want to upgrade the system, it requires me to input a password for that account.

These changes are not all implemented on the same version of macOS so you may just need to boot to single user mode on older OS to make a change, or you may need to manage SIP or the system volume may be sealed, so you learn to modify a snapshot on the filesystem and alter the boot.\nTo address the specific issue - you probably are facing a secure token / bootstrap token issue.\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/guide/deployment/use-secure-and-bootstrap-tokens-dep24dbdcf9e/web\nShort term, you might be able to erase the system but not crack to bypass the security of the other admin password if you can't get the key.\n", "Q: How do I have my iPhone/iPad not ask for passcode for each iTunes backup? iMac 2019 MacOS Mojave; iOS 15.7.1\nSometime after I updated my iPhone 8 and iPad (9th gen) I get a message on the iPhone/iPad every time I connect via USB to provide a passcode to back up the device.\n\"Enter passcode to Start a Backup\"\nOn the iMac I get the following message about the passcode requirement with the choices Cancel or Try Again.\n\"iTunes could not back up the 'device' “device name” because it is locked with a passcode.

I am new to macOS, and I was using Ubuntu for more than a decade.\nNow, I switched to macOS and I am wondering how to get Ubuntu terminal on macOS?\nDoes anyone here know how to convert macOS terminal into Ubuntu one?\n\nA: When people think \"terminal\" there are (at least) three different things.\nFirst, there's \"virtual terminal emulator\", a program that displays window on the screen and draws all those letters inside. In other words, it's responsible for how the \"terminal\" looks like. On Ubuntu it's (I guess) gnome-terminal, whereas on macOS it's Terminal.app. I doubt you can install gnome-terminal on macOS, but you can try different Terminal.app alternatives such as iTerm2, kitty, alacritty or Hyper.\nSecond, there's a \"shell\" - a program that interprets commands typed by the user and runs them. I.O.W. it's responsible for how the \"terminal\" behaves, it defines particular syntax for running commands. Both OSes come with assorted selection of shells and default to bash on Ubuntu and zsh on macOS, but bash is still (I believe) installed as an alternative. Running bash ad-hoc is possible by just typing bash. To change default shell permanently, you can use chsh command.\nchsh -s /bin/bash\n\nOr, by opening \"Users & Groups\" Preference pane, right-clicking on current user name, selecting \"Advanced Options...\" and selecting desired shell from  \"Login shell\" dropdown.\nOne is not limited to shells installed with the operating system, popular third party shells include fish and PowerShell.\nThird, there are actual commands and command-line utilities. Some are the same on both operating systems, eg. curl. Some are mostly the same but different \"flavours\", for example ls and ps behave slightly different on Ubuntu and macOS. Some, such as wget are missing on macOS but can't be installed using third-party tools. Some, like apt/apt-get are Ubuntu (Debian) specific but there exist tools that provide comparable functionality, such as Homebrew.\n", "Q: Mouse scroll wheel switches direction per scroll Starting yesterday my third-party Bluetooth mouse keeps changing the scroll direction each time I scroll.\nIf I scroll down, the screen will move down.

Must be something wrong in the Jellycomb mouse. Will update if I find a solution specific to that device.\n\nA: I have had the same issue and, if it's the same, it's hardware support related. Trying a different mouse will confirm it.\nAre you on Ventura? You can try upgrading. My mouse has been doing the yo-yo less.\n", "Q: macOS Ventura: Finder's file preview not working I noticed an issue with Ventura and wondered whether this is due to my software or a more general problem. The recent update has decreased coverage of Finder's file preview function (hit Space in Finder on any file). For instance, I noticed this behaviour for .tex and .md files - see attached screenshots.\nThis would really be a shame since this was an amazing feature. Any ideas? I played around with the default programs that open these files, didn't help so far.\n\n\n\n\nA: MacOS has never created formatted QuickLook previews for Markdown files without a third-party QL plug-in. On my Mac running Ventura, markdown files are previewed as raw text.\nIt's possible that you were using an old QL plug-in that no longer works - it's curious that Finder seems to think that com.apple.tips.TipsAppQuickLook-macOS should be the responsible plug-in.\nYou might want to check the contents of the QuickLook sub-folder of /Library and ~/Library, or list all the Quicklook plug-ins and associatedd filte types with qlmanage -m.\n\nA: macOS' QuickLook preview function has consistently deprecated older filetypes and extensions with each successive release of the operating system.\nFor example, macOS Monterey 12.3 recently removed support for .EPS (encapsulated postscript) in QuickLook.\nSeveral text editors include QuickLook plug-ins, such as BBEdit.  You might also have some success with this QL plug-in for Markdown.\n", "Q: Using text document of whitespace containing filenames to batchcopy between directories in Terminal I am using terminal in MacOS Ventura.

If an iPad is always powered, the best way to protect the battery is not to use it at all, i.e. the system charge the battery to 60% then only use the external power supply and only use the internal battery to provide transient high power to the system.\nBut there seems to be no way to let iPadOS do this. It will always charge the battery to 100% which is unhealthy and will increase the chance that the battery swell someday.\nThen what is the best way?\n\nA: \n\"which is unhealthy and will increase the chance that the battery swell someday.\"\n\nIt's certainly true that keeping the battery more often within a 20% - 80% range will extend the life of a battery; but I think it's overstating it to say that 'keeping it at 100% is unhealthy and will cause swelling'.\niPadOS does have the same Optimized Battery Charging feature that macOS and iOS have -- the OS will charge to 80% if it's left fully charged for a long time.

There are third party tools that can move Windows partitions. However, not all are compatible with macOS. According to the other post, there are two possible compatible free tools available. These tools are outlined below.\n\n*\n\n*GNOME Partition Editor (GParted). A Linux based bootable USB flash drive can be created containing this tool. After booting from the flash drive, the GParted tool can be used to move the Windows partition. If you build the bootable USB flash drive using the zip file downloaded from GParted, then both a keyboard and a mouse (or similar device) is required. One disadvantage is the keyboard and/or mouse may be need to be wired to use this tool. However, if you can boot from a Ubuntu installer flash drive, then only use of a mouse is required. One advantage is this tool does not have to be installed into Windows.\n\n\n*MiniTool Partition Wizard. This tool is installed into Windows. To move Windows, the Mac reboots and performs the move without user interaction. One advantage is any existing keyboard and mouse (or similar device) can be used. One disadvantage is this tool has to be installed in Windows and therefore will still exist on the drive after you are finished moving Windows.\n\nNote: Before attempting to move the Windows partition, the Windows chkdsk command should be applied to the NTFS volume in this partition. This can be accomplish by booting to Windows Recovery Environment (Windows RE) and entering the command below.\n\nchkdsk c: /f\n\n\nOnce Windows is moved, the command below can be used to add the free space to the macOS partition (disk0s2).\ndiskutil apfs resizecontainer disk0s2 0\n\nSimilar Questions\n\n*\n\n*Missing around 20 GB of Space on MacBook\n\n*How to add to macOS (free space) from diskutil list?\n\n*Can I delete a partition and leave the space unallocated in Monterey?\n", "Q: Block Quick Look During Downtime According to System Preferences, the Downtime feature of Screen Time \"[s]ets a schedule for time away from the screen. During downtime, only apps that you choose to allow and phone calls will be available.\" Downtime blocks most apps, but it does not block Finder. It blocks the Quick Look feature of Finder for video but not audio or PDF. How can I block Quick Look for all file types during downtime? Alternatively, can I force a log out during downtime? As I recall, the Restrictions feature that preceded Screen Time could force a log out. If Screen Time cannot do this, then what parental control apps can?\n\nA: You're better off using software like Qustodio, which will do exactly what you want.\nThere's no native way to force a log out between certain periods.\nTechnically, you can do it manually with plist launch items set at intervals between the log out and log in times, but this is fraught.\nNotably, the MacOs downtime feature has bugs, anyway. For instance, if the computer rolls over into downtime whilst Paramount Plus is playing in full screen mode, command tabbing out of full screen, then clicking on Chrome in the dock will bring the fullscreen video back up in viewable form.\nTry Qustodio.\n", "Q: Apps (like calculator) appear in the dock without adding them there Like the title suggests, I noticed calculator was in the dock without me adding it there. Could this be a virus or something? I have Macbook pro 13 inch from 2015. Thank you.\n\nA: Recently used apps are by default shown in the Dock.\nYou can disable that by choosing System Preferences->Dock & Menu Bar and then deselecting  the “Show recent applications in Dock” checkbox in macOS Monterey. In macOS Ventura,  go to System Settings, click Desktop & Dock  in the sidebar, and go to Dock on the right and scroll down a bit for the same setting.\n\nA: Check in System Preferences->Dock & Menu Bar\nIf you have the \"Show recent apps in Dock\" enabled\n\n", "Q: Where did /usr/local/git come from?

This is deliberate, I do not want to backup all my devices to iCloud. My MacBook gets backed up in a number of ways including TimeMachine.\nThe devices used to backup and sync automatically and silently every time I plugged them in to charge overnight.\nSince upgrading to macOS Ventura, every time the devices attempt to sync they require me to enter the device passcode.\nI have also upgraded the phone to iOS 16 (when that came out, now 16.1) and the iPad Air to iPad 16 (once that was released, now 16.1).\nThe iPad mini is not eligible and so is still on iPadOS 15 (15.7.1). But it still asks for the passcode - so I am guessing it is a macOS thing and not an iOS/iPadOS thing.\nHow can I prevent the devices from requiring a passcode every time they attempt to sync?\n\nA: EDIT: Not a bug.

I've tried to illustrate the current situation and desired situation in the below diagram:\n\n\nA: I don't think that macOS can be configured like this natively.\nUnlike other OSes, macOS is hierarchical in the way that windows 'belong' to an application object. An application is in the 'foreground' (e.g. it's the frontmost object, with focus), and it may have zero, one or more windows open.\nIf you close a window, you still stay 'in' the application -- even if there are no windows at all.\n(Except for apps that can only have one window, which do quit on close.)\nIt is possible to overlay windows of different applications; though normally, switching to an app will bring all its windows to the front.\nAssuming that macOS did/could switch to another application whenever you closed one document window -- there are many scenarios where this would be deeply annoying. And if you have other applications open, how is macOS to know which other app you want?\nIf you want to switch to the Finder, then switch to the Finder.

Obviously copied from the iOS Settings without enough care and attention. On macOS this list of background apps is bound to confuse users and raise often unwarranted fears.\nJust to clear up a minor confusion. Items in the list are those allowed to run in the background. This list does not indicate that they are running.\nCharlie Stigler is likely the developer of an app you have installed. This name appears because it is associated with the digital certificate signing the background app. You will need to use web searches to discover what apps Charlie Stigler has created. My best guess is this Charlie Stigler who has an app called SelfControl.\nFor 'eudataback' there is (as you have discovered) an information button which locates the background app in Finder. That gives the hint that it is part of the Easus Backup Software.\nVery likely all your background apps are legitimate.\nBut note that they could include apps that you uninstalled in past by just deleting the app in /Applications without discovering and removing associated files and tasks.\nApple will need to do something to cleanup the \"Allow in the Background\" list so that the parent app is correctly displayed.  This may be difficult where the parent app has been deleted but the background tasks have not.\nIt seems downright sloppy that Apple has not tidied things up their own background tasks. I don't have OSMessageTracer Pathway in my list, but I am pretty sure this is legitimate. Possibly it a remnant from an earlier version of macOS - see Is OSMessageTracing in Startup Login Items Legitimate?\nI do have com.apple.bluetooth.PacketLoggerHelper in my list.\nI will end with an example on my Mac showing that it may not be easy to track down all legitimate items.

I'm trying to run a 3rd party application through the Spyder Python IDE. I'm able to import the code and it runs through the command line using the Terminal application but Spyder appears to be more careful about code signing permissions, and it won't run the code. The initial error said that the code wasn't signed at all. The error was\n'/path/libmylibrary.dylib' not valid for use in process: mapped file has no cdhash, completely unsigned? Code has to be at least ad-hoc signed.)\nBy entering codesign -d -v /path/libmylibrary.dylib I was able to see the code signing status, which said that, indeed, the code was unsigned. I then signed the code by entering codesign -s - /path/libmylibrary.dylib and the code was then signed. However, there were still problems. Running at this point led to the new error\n'/path/libmylibrary.dylib' not valid for use in process: mapped file has no Team ID and is not a platform binary (signed with custom identity or adhoc?)\nSure enough, it's still correct. The library TeamIdentifier is still equal to \"not set\". But here, I'm stuck. I can't seem to find any way to set this value to anything else. Any advice on how to fix this would be much appreciated.\nDetails: Computer is a 2022 M1 MacBook Pro running OS 12.6 and Spyder is version 5.3.3. Spyder says that it's running Python 3.9.5, but if I run Python from the command line, then it's version 3.10.\n\nA: I finally fixed the problem. @mmmmmm was correct that the issue had to do with Python versions and not with code signing at all.\nIn Spyder, set the library directories with Tools/PYTHONPATH manager. I unselected the Spyder.app path because that was causing conflicts with my user path. I found which user path I wanted by starting Python in a command line, importing a file, and entering myfile.__file__.\nAlso, set the Python version in Spyder with Preferences/Python interpreter. I found which Python I wanted by entering which python in the command line. Spyder shows what Python you're using at the bottom of the window.\nFinally, I needed to restart Spyder for these changes to take effect.

My goal is to have access to the install of my old Mac on my new Mac without operating two Macs side-by-side. The configurations are:\n\n*\n\n*Old Mac:\n\n*\n\n*El Capitan 10.11.6\n\n*Intel processor\n\n\n\n*New Mac\n\n*\n\n*Ventura 13.0\n\n*Apple M1 processor\n\n\n\nThe reason is that I will need some applications from the old Mac for which I don't have equivalents on the new Mac.\nIs there a possibility to run these older apps on the new Mac in virtualised or emulated environment on the new Mac like Parallels, VMWare or another app?\n\nA: \nIs there a possibility to run these older apps on the new Mac in a virtual environment on the new Mac like Parallels, VMWare or another app?\n\nYes! The best solution for older macOS is UTM, which is actually just QEMU. I’ve used QEMU for old Intel virtual machines (via emulation), despite it is very slow. I'll try to impress on you how slow; imagine taking your El Capitan 10.11.6 virtual machine and run it on an original Intel Pentium from 1993. That is the level of performance you will experience.\nA comparison of technologies:\n\n\n\n\nFeature\nQEMU\nFusion\nParallels\n\n\n\n\nType\nEmulation & Virtualization\nVirtualization\nVirtualization\n\n\nSpeed\nEmulation (slow)Virtualization (fast)\nFast\nFast\n\n\nLimitations\nConfiguration is not trivial\nTech Previewdoes notsupportmacOS yet\nOldestsupportedis Monterey\n\n\nIntel CPUsupport\nVia Emulation\nNone, likelynever\nNone, likelynever\n\n\n\n\nVirtualization is emulation of hardware, such as Ethernet, Bluetooth, Disk controllers, and boot environments (EFI). The operating system has to be the same CPU architecture.\nEmulation is virtualization of the CPU, which is required to run an Intel operating system on an ARM system like the Apple M1/M2. Virtualization of hardware may also be required.\nThe technology in QEMU to emulate began in 2009, the only other similar project is Bochs. QEMU is clearly the better performing of the two.\nFor an example of exactly how slow, in this article they ran Geekbench inside an Intel emulated system. The emulated Intel scored 68, but a native M1 scored 1730. That is a loss of 96% of the speed of native.\n\nA: The problem is the difference in CPU architecture. Virtualization works because the software is just pretending to be another OS running on the same sort of CPU as it would do natively.\nWhen you 'mix' CPU types, then the VM has to translate the Intel code into ARM instructions in real time, instead of just passing it on to the CPU. This is usually called \"emulation\", not \"virtualization\".\nApple already provides Rosetta, which creates a translated version of an application's code: but doing the translation at the OS level is much more difficult (because most of what an OS does is about controlling hardware) and involves a large performance penalty for the extra work.\nIn short: your goal of having a virtual copy of your old Mac on your new one is not practicable.\nEither keep your old Mac and use Screen Sharing or Universal Control to access it from your new Mac; or just migrate all your files and use new versions of your apps.\n\nA: According to Parallels - you can run an older version of MacOS as a Guest Operating System, but there are limitations. In short, you can only run the ARM version of MacOS 12 or 13 on your M1 Mac.\nRegarding VMWare - it looks like the latest version that runs on M1 Macs is currently a tech preview, version 22H2. According to VMWare's release notes:\n\n*\n\n*Fusion will not support running VMs across different architectures.\n(I.e. no x86_64 VMs on M1 Macs).\n\n*macOS virtual machines are out of scope for this release, but it’s something we’re looking into.\n\nSo, currently, neither of these applications will support running El Capitan in a virtualized manner on your M1 Mac under Ventura. Perhaps you can investigate if the applications you need will run on 10.12 on an M1 machine under Rosetta 2. Check here for some background on this.\n", "Q: Avoid putting all windows of a given app on foreground when tabbing I often have say a fullscreen* window of Chrome open, for example, and a secondary one on the left half of my screen, and want to take notes in another app open on the right half of my screen.

For example, use the hidutil command-line tool to remap the 'A' key to the 'B' key as shown in Listing 1. The map array consists of two key/value pairs that contain the source (HIDKeyboardModifierMappingSrc) and destination (HIDKeyboardModifierMappingDstKey) of the key remapping.

Screenshot below.\n\n\nA: Open up the TV or Music app in macOS and start the sync from there.\nFirst, I consider this more of a kludge/workaround instead of a clear fix, but it works for me and hopefully can hopefully help others!\nLaunch the TV or Music app in macOS, look for the device you want to sync under “Devices” in the left-hand sidebar, right click the device and start the sync from there.\n\nOnce that’s done, the Wi-Fi sync will begin and you can see the device show up again in the sidebar in the Finder. Hooray!\nBut hopefully there is a cleaner way to do this so the devices show up again in the Finder without launching another app. Maybe a new macOS patch update will solve this?\n\nIf anyone else has a cleaner way to do this or notices this issue is “fixed” with a macOS update, feel free to post your own answer. This answer is about a kludge in my mind; green check will be shifted to a real answer when that comes along.\n", "Q: Photos app - import into specific folder When I import a folder of photos into the Photos app there is an option at the top of the import window that says \"Import to:\" and there is an option Library where there is a dropdown of your existing folder hierarchy, but try as I might I can't get it to import into a specific folder. It always imports into My Albums root and I have to drag it to the correct location. I'm wondering what that function is supposed to do as it doesn't seem to do what I expect (or anything for that matter).\n\nA: Ok after about an hour fiddling around...\nImport to Library is expecting an Album as the landing point. Nowhere is this documented and the word 'Library' is a bit confusing. If you point to an Album then it won't retain any folder structure and just dump all the images on the one Album. To maintain folder structure (which is grayed out with this option) just tick Library and let it go to root. Then drag that folder structure to its new location in the Folder hierarchy and everything works.\n", "Q: How to prevent black screen on MacBook Pro in the future For a while now, my 2017 MacBook Pro has had issues with turning on after shutting down.\nWhenever I attempt to shut it down, it can never fully do so by itself it seems and I always have to force-shut it down using the power button. Then, when I turn it on again, the laptop turns on but shows only a black screen, preventing me from doing anything or signing in. Every time this has happened, I have then turned on my laptop in macOS Recovery and used Disk Utility to repair volumes, containers and then disks (following the instructions given by Apple on its website). After that, my laptop turns on just fine and the black screen is gone.\nMy question is: how can I prevent this issue in the future? I have no idea what application or system extension or thing is causing this problem, so I don't know what to do or delete. Is there a way to check?\n\nA: Firstly, restart into Safe Boot mode (hold shift at start). Then see if it will shutdown and restart normally. If so: then you know it is not a hardware issue.\nYou may also want to reset the NVRAM.\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT204063\nNext, I would recommend using EtreCheck, which is an application that produces a report of the 'state' of your Mac, including any background processes that are running.\nIf you paste the report here (it contains no personal details), then someone might spot something that needs attention. Otherwise, remove anything that you don't need; and make sure everything else is up-to-date.\nAlternatively, this might be one of the rare situations when a 'clean' install is useful: Erase the volume, install the OS, and then only migrate your data and settings. Finish off the process by manually copying/downloading/installing the apps that you need.\n", "Q: How do I prevent MacOS 11.2.3 (20D91) from logging out after some minutes inactivity? I am running a task on an old iMac. MacOS version is 11.2.3 (20D91).\nThe task is about downloading 8000+ photos from an old iPhone with Image Capture. The task goes on very smoothly if the macOS doesn't go to sleep.\nThe problem is, my macOS will go to sleep/logging-out. It's not turning off the screen, but playing a screensaver animation like this below:\n\nWhen I click a mouse button or keyboard key, the computer tells me to enter my password again. And the downloading progress is stuck, taking more than 5 minutes to resume.\nI first thought this issue was very easy to solve and I searched for some articles about how to prevent mac from sleeping/logging out.\nBut I failed after many attempts.\nFirst, I have checked off this:\n\nSecond, I have checked these settings:\n\nIt's still showing the screensaver after like 20 minutes of inactivity.\nWhat else should I do?\n\nA: Your search keyword for this is caffeinate but you can also do this from System Prefs > Desktop & Screen Saver > Screen Saver > Hot Corners. Pick one corner to Disable Screen Saver, which will also prevent sleep when combined with your other settings.\n\n", "Q: Why can’t I hear notifications on my iPhone?

I have a 2014 mini with 2 bootable partitions. Yosemite on one and Catalina on the other. Obviously, need to run legacy software.\nWhen running Yosemite, the Catalina drive doesn't mount. So it can't be selected as the boot disk from within Yosemite.\nThe wireless keyboard doesn't interrupt the boot sequence for keyboard shortcuts to work.\nHaven't found a third party boot manager to work in this setup and a wired keyboard doesn't suit the workspace.\nI have the \"sudo nvram manufacturing-enter-picker=true\" saved to a text file. Too much to explain to the user,\"open terminal, cut, paste, etc.\"\nIt would seem that this would just be a line written into a file but which, where, how?\n\nA: You could install the rEFInd boot manager so rEFInd could be selected from the  Startup Disk pane of Yosemite's System Preferences. The rEFInd boot manager would need to configured to automatically boot Catalina.\nTo change from Catalina to Yosemite, you would select Yosemite from the Startup Disk pane of Catalina's System Preferences.\nrEFInd can be downloaded used for free.\n\nYou could also configure rEFInd so the version of OS X (macOS) to boot would be determined by just a line written into a file.\n", "Q: How to use Spotlight to open a Chrome Bookmark?

What I am looking for is a one stop tool to open my bookmarks from anywhere on my Mac.\n\nA: \"Bookmarks and History\" is an option for Spotlight search results, so if you type the name of a bookmark, it should show up.\nHowever, I don't know whether the OS supports other browsers than Safari in this regard; or if it does, whether Spotlight would need to 'support it back'.\nIn short: I'd suggest that if Bookmarks is selected for search results, and you don't see bookmarks from Chrome, then the answer is \"no\".\n", "Q: Prevent MacOS (Monterey) from Always Turning Wi-Fi ON when Startup or Log in I notice MacOS always turns on Wi-Fi at startup, without my authorization.

Adding the child's Outlook account to iOS via Settings > Accounts as a Microsoft Exchange account avoids the web login and thus avoids the issue, though the account is added to iOS and thus their mail will come in to the iOS mail app.\nThis is not a solution per se, but a workaround. I was unable to find a solution. I am a former Microsoft Outlook engineer and now a web developer. My theory is that this is a bug in Microsoft's sign-in web flow and the user-agent string that the embedded browser login box sends.\nYou'd think the browser in the embedded modal dialog was Safari, and it must be since iOS can only run Safari, but something's amiss because my daughter can run Safari itself just fine.\n", "Q: Display Apple Watch heart rate continuously on iPhone? During a work out using the Apple Watch native workout app, is there a way to display the Apple Watch heart rate data continuously on the iPhone?\n\nA: You can with 3rd party apps, like Cardiogram. The realtime-ness of it won't be instant as it has to sync the data with your phone but it is continuous.(see Cardiogram article [Apple Watch] What does the option of ‘Continuous recording' mean?)\n\n'Continuous recording' allows your Apple watch to collect a heart rate reading every 5 seconds.

What would the difference in speed be between:\n\n*\n\n*2022 Apple MacBook Air Laptop with M2 chip\n\n*2022 Apple MacBook Pro Laptop with M2 chip\n\nBoth have M2. But the other parts like the bus, the memory and the SSD may be different.\n\nA: The biggest difference is active cooling in the MacBook Pro. For any workloads that last longer than 5-10 minutes, expect a slight performance increase in the Pro relative to the Air.\nThis does NOT mean the Air cannot handle sustained load. It will just be slower than the Pro while doing so. For example, I find it can sustain Minecraft performance at 60 FPS without any trouble, even after it starts thermal throttling.\nOne note on SSDs: some models (M2 Air/Pro 256GB models specifically) use a single 256GB chip inside, rather than two 128GB chips. This will make them slower than the 512GB models that use two 256GB chips.

I believe I have either 16 or 32 gigabytes of memory, I am not exactly an expert on the subject.\nIn summary, I hope to ask for help with generally how to best speed up my Mac, and, ideally and if possible also how best to maintain it to keep it running smoothly and fast.\nSpecifically I have 3 questions regarding that but that's my overall problem and question I have to ask for insight on.\nProbably worth noting, I have recently downloaded many new apps and frankly don't even know what most do and definitely do not seem to know or how to determine what is running and when.\n\n*\n\n*How do I delete and I fully uninstall a given app along with deleting all relating data/files etc? (To ensure nothing is left behind taking up space or possibly running)\n\n\n*How do I simply and efficiently learn/see which and what is currently running at any given time and then quit those which I'm not using and how do quit them in full and not allow them to automatically resume running unless I chose to open them?\n\n\n*Most important question: How do I safely, correctly & effectively clean up space on my startup disk?\n(Any tips on how to correctly do anything mentioned and or generally how to fix whatever is causing my mac to run so slowly would all be deeply appreciated)\n\nA: As you've said, you're not running low of disk space, so that's not the problem, and there's no immediate urgency to start deleting stuff. However, a tidy system is always a good thing.\nYou can use Activity Monitor (in /Applications/Utilities) to see what processes are running, and what is using excessive CPU and RAM.\nYou may need to click on View > All Processes to get a full picture.\n(I usually leave it running all the time, so if something goes wrong, I can switch to it, rather than trying to load it when the system's slow.)\nThe Memory tab also has a nice little graph at the bottom, which shows you the memory pressure. Low and green is good; high and red is bad.\n\nNote that it's normal for 'Memory Used\" plus 'Cached Files' to equal the total size of your RAM.\nIf you can't see any particular process that's eating up memory or CPU, then we move to the next thing.\nLook inside /Library, in two folders: LaunchAgents and LaunchDaemons. Note: this is the top level Library folder at the root level of your disk (next to System and Applications.) But also look in the same subfolders of your user account. (~/Library.)\nThis is where background processes that might run silently are stored. If you recognise the name of anything here, then see if that application has an uninstaller, or instructions for removal. In extremis, you can just delete it, and then restart.\nYou can also look at Login Items in System Preferences > Users & Groups.\nYou can see what apps you have installed in /Applications, of course. Most apps can just be deleted there, and they may leave behind a few configuration files, but these are usually tiny (Kilobytes) and will not do anything -- they won't be loaded in the absence of the app.\nAnything that came with an installer package may need an uninstaller, and you should ask the developer for details.\nI know you're trying to remove stuff, but you could use an app called EtreCheck, which produces a report about the state of your Mac, including all third-party background processes, and other useful troubleshooting information. You can post the report here (there's no personal info in it), and someone may be able to identify any problems.\n", "Q: Apple Watch locks apps because of \"App free time\" Until 7 am most apps on my Apple Watch can't be used (shown as disabled icons) with the message that it's a app-free time.\nI've checked all settings.

I manage a Macos Monterey computer, and I'm using a cloud backup service for it, including its Photos.library. When files are deleted from the computer, the backup service moves the corresponding backup-file to the cloud trashbin.\nToday, the backup service notified me that \"a large number of files have been deleted from your backup\", and offered me to recover them from the cloud trashbin.\nUpon inspecting the trashbin, I see that 3891 files and 4329 folders have been deleted.\n\nThey were all originally in ~/Pictures/Pictures library.photoslibrary/resources/cpl/cloudsync.noindex/storage/filecache/.....\n\n*\n\n*About half of them are actual .jpeg files, in the original file size.\n\n*Most of the other files have a UUID filename and no file extension.\n\n*There are also a bunch of folders named PrimarySync-[random string]\nI did some random samples of the .jpeg - they could still be found in the actual Photos app on the Mac, so I'm pretty sure nothing important has been deleted here.\nMy questions are:\n\n*\n\n*What are the files within ~/Pictures/Pictures library.photoslibrary/resources/cpl/cloudsync.noindex\n\n*Can I be reasonably sure that nothing important is being deleted?\n\n*The files have almost certainly not been deleted on purpose. Why has the OS (and/or Photos.app) deleted them?\n\n\nA: As a general comment on Photos and its libraries, we are not supposed, by Apple, to need to know about the internal structure and how it is managed.  Nevertheless:\n\n*\n\n*What are the files within ~/Pictures/Pictures library.photoslibrary/resources/cpl/cloudsync.noindex?\n\nFrom the folder names, I am pretty sure these are related to syncing (either potential or actual) with iCloud.\n\n*\n\n*Can I be reasonably sure that nothing important is being deleted?\n\nTime Machine does not attempt to backup anything inside ~/Pictures/Pictures library.photoslibrary/resources/cpl, so I am confident you have not lost anything.\n\n*\n\n*The files have almost certainly not been deleted on purpose. Why has the OS (and/or Photos.app) deleted them?\n\nAh, the mysteries of what we are not supposed to touch! At a guess, Photos has decided it does not need them for syncing with iCloud. That is temporary storage not longer needed.  They might come back again.\nThe most essential folder within the Photos library is originals.\nHaving created an answer to your questions, I have a few comments to make about what you are doing.\n\n*\n\n*Jottacloud describes itself as a backup, but in reality it is a synchronisation from your Mac to its cloud. In other words, what is stored in Jottacloud is intended to be identical to what is on your Mac. If, as you have discovered, something is deleted (or corrupted) that will be duplicated to Jottacloud.\n\n*A true backup keeps old files in case you need to recover them in the future. Similarly it keeps old versions of files which have changed. Examples are Backblaze which keeps old files for a limited time and Arq Backup which keeps old and outdated files as long as you want (and can pay for storage).\n\n*With a backup service, it is best practice to configure it use the same exceptions as Time Machine.\n\n*Whilst you are keeping current copies of your data in Jottacloud, you should also have a local backup. Time Machine to an external disk is the most straight forward way of doing this.\n\n", "Q: What do the numbered folders in ~/Library/Mail mean? Bit of context: I deleted a mailbox (folder?) in Mail\n\nThen a second later I realized I may have needed something from it and found that once you delete a mailbox all content is lost forever. So I went into my backups to see if I could find the mailbox/emails, and found this directory structure:\n\nMy question is: what is the logic behind these numbers? Specifically the 0-9 nested folders. If I want to navigate around this directory at all how can I use these numbers?\n\nA: This format is used in a number of Apple's own data structures. You'll also see it inside the Photo Library bundle, and in various temp folders.\nI don't think there's any documentation for how it works, and really \"it's not for browsing\".\nIf you need to restore a mailbox, you can invoke Time Machine directly from the Mail app (using the TM menulet) to browse through past snapshots.\n\nA: It is a standard way to store many files in a file system. The issue is to keep tyhe number of files in a directory down as the low level code to find a file in a directory looks at each entry in the directory in a linear order, thus the speed of finding the file is proportional to the number of files in the directory.\nHow the files are split between directories is application dependent and there is no way to see from just the file system or Finder where an individual file will go. Thus the files are only usefully accessed by the application that writes them.\nIn this case it looks like each message is given an id that increases by one for each new message. This is reasonably common for Unix mail and nntp clients. Other apps e.g. Messages storing attachments generate hashs so the directories don't increase by one for each new attachment, this improves the spread of things into different directories.\n", "Q: Extract an APFS disk image without mounting it I have disk image that is reported to have an APFS file system.\n$ file disk.img\ndisk.img: Apple File System (APFS), blocksize 4096\n\nHow can I extract the disk image without mounting it?\n\nA: 7-Zip can extract disk images, but release 22.00 or later is required to to extract APFS images.\n7z provided by the Homebrew package p7zip currently does not support APFS images.\n$ brew info p7zip | grep stable\n==> p7zip: stable 17.04 (bottled)\n\n$ /usr/local/bin/7z | grep 7-Zip\n7-Zip [64] 17.04 : Copyright (c) 1999-2021 Igor Pavlov : 2017-08-28\n\n$ file disk.img\ndisk.img: Apple File System (APFS), blocksize 4096\n\n$ /usr/local/bin/7z x disk.img 1>/dev/null\nERROR: disk.img\nCan not open the file as archive\n\n7zz provided by the Homebrew package sevenzip does support APFS images.\n$ brew info sevenzip | grep stable\n==> sevenzip: stable 22.01 (bottled)\n\n$ /usr/local/bin/7zz | grep 7-Zip\n7-Zip (z) 22.01 (x64) : Copyright (c) 1999-2022 Igor Pavlov : 2022-07-15\n\nUse 7zz to extract the disk image.\n/usr/local/bin/7zz x disk.img\n\n\nThe latest binary release 7z2107-mac.tar.xz currently offered on Sourceforge is compiled from version 21.07 and therefore does not support APFS images.\nThe latest source release 7z2201-src.tar.xz currently needs to be patched to build.\n\n", "Q: Cannot uninstall Python from homebrew which -a python3\n/opt/homebrew/bin/python3 \n/opt/homebrew/bin/python3 \n/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.10/bin/python3 \n/usr/local/bin/python3 \n/usr/bin/python3 \n\nI want to uninstall the Python from homebrew and want to keep the default one or want to install it from the official website.\nBut I cannot do this, whenever I run this command  brew uninstall python\nIt gives me : Error: No such keg: /opt/homebrew/Cellar/python\n\nA: As the package is called python3, try:\nbrew uninstall python3\n\n\nA: Since you have used brew, you may have several Python versions, since some other bottles may need different versions.

I don't think you missed anything and just need to remove it from the online site to finish the cleanup you desire.\nHave you tried locating it in Find My after this event?\nWhen you remove it from the iCloud online settings, it should let you know that it's gone unless the device is still signed in which would then renew the connection on Apple's servers between that serial and your storage / account.\nMy hunch is you can no longer track that Mac and everything worked as expected, but you would need to open a case with Apple support if needed and they would go through the steps and perhaps have you grant them support access via a PIN exchange to inspect your data with your permission on their servers if you can't come to a good answer here or with their initial help.\n", "Q: How can I set two separate Terminal profiles whereby one profile keeps a history and one doesn't? I'm using zsh in macOS 13.\nI sometimes want to just try out a few things in Terminal without wanting to keep any history or log of these once I close the Terminal window/tab. On other occasions I do want to keep the history though. So I created two profiles in Terminal, History and No History and then I launch whichever I need.

This is an issue I didn't even know was possible...\nI moved a bunch of directories over to iCloud to back them up. These directories had a bunch of subdirectories, many of which have subdirectories, all of which have lots of files.\nMy flow was as such: copy over, then wait for iCloud to say that it has been fully synced. Then on the parent directory, I right clicked and chose \"Remove Download,\" which presumably removes the local copies recursively. The cloud with a little down arrow appeared, which presumably means that everything has been synced remotely and removed locally...\nExcept I realized that somehow, there were still a bunch of subdirectories that hadn't been removed locally. In some cases, a subdirectory would register as having been removed locally (it had the cloud with the down arrow) but when I looked inside of it, there would be folders or files that hadn't been removed locally. This is frustrating, because it seems like if the cloud with the down arrow is there iCloud thinks that all of the subdirectories/files have been removed...you cannot select \"remove download\" even though not all of the files have been removed!\nSo I had to very tediously crawl the subdirectories myself, looking for unsynced files and directories, and right click and select \"remove download.\" This is super tedious! We are programmers, after all! This shouldn't be necessary.\nSo I'm wondering if there is a programmatic way to remove files locally? Maybe a way to surface all of the files/directories that haven't been removed locally? There has to be a better way than \"recurse the file hierarchy myself looking for folders or files that don't have the cloud with a down arrow then right click and do remove download.\" Is there?\n\nA: A workaround might be to -1- download them all.

Macbook Pro (mbp) with two thunderbolt ports. A Drobo thunderbolt 2 disk with daisychain ability (two ports) and now need to connect USB-C portable disk. mbp connects to Drobo via Apple tb3->tb2 connector and tb2 cable. When I plug tb2 cable to Drobo's second port with tb2->tb3 connector to USB-C port nothing happens.\nAll this since need to copy a massive volume, need power supply, but mbp has only two ports.\n\nA: The Apple TB3-to-TB2 adapter only does conversion for the Thunderbolt protocol and nothing else, it will not pass through USB or DisplayPort.  USB-C will allow for a number of protocols, including Thunderbolt, USB, DisplayPort, and perhaps more.  USB-C is a specification for a physical connector, a specification that does not require support for the USB protocol.  There's two parts to USB, the physical connection and the protocol, and having one does not necessitate support for the other.  Just because the TB3-to-TB2 adapter has a USB-C physical connection does not mean it supports the USB protocol.\nWhat I found that works for me is a Thunderbolt USB-C dock.  Connect the dock by a Thunderbolt cable and each USB-C port will support Thunderbolt and USB 3.x.  This works because the dock contains a controller chip for USB.  If the dock is connected to the host by a passive USB-C to USB-C cable then it should support DisplayPort in addition to ThunderBolt and USB.\nA USB (that is USB the protocol, not just the physical connection) dock will not support Thunderbolt devices.  Thunderbolt is a variation on the PCI protocol and so it is cheap and easy to add a USB controller, PCI is how USB controllers are connected to the computer CPU internally.  There's no adapter to get Thunderbolt devices to talk the USB protocol, but there are adapters for USB devices to connect to Thunderbolt.\nI'm assuming the USB-C drive you refer to is using the USB 3.x protocol as it is not functional with a TB adapter.  If it is a TB drive then the problem may be a lack of power.  While TB ports will provide something like 10 watts of power there may not be a whole lot of power left after chaining two TB adapters together.  A powered dock or hub should resolve that issue.\nAs I see it the solution is a Thunderbolt dock or hub regardless of where the issue lies.  If there is not enough power to the drive then you need something in the middle to provide power.  If the issue is trying to connect a USB protocol device to a Thunderbolt port then you need something in the middle to do the translation.  A Thunderbolt hub or dock will provide both power and USB controller.\n", "Q: How can I find the minimum wattage requirement to charge a MacBook?

The powerbanks outputted 20 watts, and I know if a MacBook is provided with too low wattage, it simply won't charge, but I don't know if that minimum is above or below 20W.\nQuestion\nMost powerbanks will provide some info like this:\n\nIs there a general way to find out if this meets the requirements to charge a particular MacBook? For example, by looking up system settings, or via some online resource?\nNote:\n\n*\n\n*This question isn't about a specific model MacBook (neither the one mentioned above, nor any other specific MacBook, for example this one), but purely a solution in the general sense (i.e. one that can be used for all/any MacBooks - like an online resource or way of looking this value up in system settings).\n\n\nA: I’ve used 5 volt 2.1 amp USB-A charger with a USB-C cable for M1 Max MacBook Pro 16.\nI suspect anything 5 watt plus will work.\nHere is an on topic YouTube video.\nTo be very clear, at less than 15 to 20 watts, your battery may drain faster than it can be charged if the computer isn’t idle.\nThis command tells you the current power draw:\nsudo powermetrics -i 1000 -s cpu_power,gpu_power | \\\n    egrep '^Package Power:|^GPU Power:'\n\nYou will likely lose 5 percent of the charge efficiency. In my testing while typing this, my M1 Max used about 500 mW to 961 mW. That is about 1 watt. So a 5 watt iPhone charger would maintain my current power level. If you are using significantly more power, you will want a much higher power output like the 20 watt to 96 watt chargers.\n@gidds also recommended a menu bar app to determine power draw.\n", "Q: Why does Mac running Ventura OS now insist on using FN key to deliver function keys For some reason, the latest Mac OS - unprompted - insists that I press the FN key for the functionality that is displayed on functions.

This opens a small dialog box, you paste your link, then hit the OK button.\nWith the keyboard you use the sequence CmdK CmdV, Return.\nIt’s much faster than pasting (CmdV) into Mail, waiting for it to convert the link to a preview, grabbing the mouse, search the small popup handle, clicking once to open the popup, etc.\nJust type CmdK CmdV Return.\n\nA: I also discovered that if you type a space and then paste the URL, it seems to not trigger the Link Preview creation.

Apple events are the inter-application messages that AppleScript uses to communicate with scriptable applications, and send instructions to perform a particular function.\nThe quickest discriminator in this regard is to use AppleScript to dispatch an instruction to the Logitech G Hub app telling it to close its windows.\nTo do this, create a new document in Script Editor, and make sure the Logitech G Hub application is up and running with a visible window on-screen.\nThen type and execute the following code: \ntell application \"lghub\" to close its windows\n\n\nIf the app is scriptable, then that's all the code you need, and your problem is solved.  However, if it throws an error, it'll be because it won't be able to get the application's windows.\nOtherwise, ...\nIn this eventuality, the application is not scriptable.  So we'll need to resort to using System Events instead.\nSystem Events is a multi-purpose, background-only (i.e. invisible), scriptable application that has a lot of feature sets.  One of the most popular amongst novice scripters is its ability to hack the user interface and manipulate graphical on-screen elements of almost any application.\nThese elements include buttons, windows, scroll bars, text boxes, etc.  It requires privileges to be granted in order to do this, so you'll get a few requests for authorisation upon attempting this the first time for any given application.  It is a potential security issue once you grant authorisation, so bear this in mind considering what I've just described as being in the remit of System Events' capabilities, namely to assume control of any visual element on-screen.\nAssuming you're fine with this...\nStart with a blank document in Script Editor, and execute the following command to obtain the bundle identifier of the Logitech G Hub application:\nget the id of application \"lghub\"\n\n\nThis will return a string along the lines of \"com.logi.ghub\" or something.  It's another means by which we can reference the application instead of using its name (\"lghub\").  It's more robust to use the application id rather than its name in general, but sometimes it's necessary in System Events, which doesn't interface with the application object from above, but with a process (or application process) object that is something separate.  Often, these are named the same as the application that spawns the process, but occasionally they're not.  Bundle identifiers, however, are always identical.\nHere's the code to close the window with System Events: \ntell application \"System Events\" to tell (the first process ¬\n        whose bundle identifier is \"com.logi.ghub\") to tell ¬\n        the front window to if (exists) then tell attribute ¬\n        \"AXCloseButton\" to click its value\n\n\nThis targets the Logitech G Hub application process, which is a shell that contains everything needed for the application to run.  This includes the physical UI elements, such as the window, which we first identify actually exists (to avoid throwing an error if it doesn't), and if so, we read off a reference to the red close button stored as one of the window's attributes.  Once we have that reference, we can tell the button to behave as if we had clicked it, namely, to close the window.\nDone.\nTo restore the window, you can do so like this: \ntell application id \"com.logi.ghub\" to reopen\n\n", "Q: iPad Air 5th Gen gets massively hot while using ANY notetaking app and Apple Pencil 2 iPad Air 5th gen gets massively hot and drains battery, when using just any note taking app and Apple Pencil.\nEven if I do not have any Note taking app active, when I just attach the Pencil to the side (connected to iPad), the iPad gets very hot and drains battery.\nIs this normal for iPad?\n\nA: The simple answer to your question \"is this normal\" is most likely yes. iPads have no active cooling. I have been using Notability and Goodnotes and found that no matter which App I use for notes, I have been experiencing high temps due to high screen brightness. If you also charge at the same time you produce even more heat. Therefore, ideally you use a lower screen brightness (something closer to 50% or even less) and don't charge while using those apps. This helped in my case using the previous iPad Air.\nEdit:\nGiven your more detailed usage description I don't think this is normal. I have never seen my battery drain completely within 60 minutes. Also, I have never experienced that the iPad does not charge due to heat. Maybe go to the next Apple Store and check with them what you should do.\n", "Q: Is it possible to replace Macbook Air 2017's SSD? Mine is a 2017 i5 Macbook Air. I think 128 GB is severely limited for software development purpose these days.\n512 is preferrable, because I have more space for Xcode, some VirtualBox VMs, etc.\nIs it possible to replace the SSD?\n\nA: Yes.\nThe 2017 MacBook Air's SSD is not soldered and is replaceable.\nIt does however use a proprietary connector. You'll either have to get a compatible SSD from an Apple Service Provider, a 3rd party like OWC or use an adapter with an M.2 SSD.\nThere is a guide available on iFixit.\n", "Q: Accidentally deleted Fusion Drive SSD partition - need help recovering data I accidentally formatted the SSD part of an APFS-formatted Fusion Drive during an SSD upgrade. Well, not accidentally, I did it on purpose wrongfully thinking that the Apple SSD wouldn't be needed anymore.\nThe original hard drive is untouched and raw cloned to another drive for safety. I pulled out the Apple SSD and bought a PCI-e adapter (I mainly use Windows). I've got access to the iMac I pulled the drives from and it boots to a freshly-installed Ventura install in a SATA SSD drive.\nAll of this is because a customer wanted to upgrade their iMac to an SSD. At the time I wasn't aware how Fusion Drives worked, so here's what I did:\n\n*\n\n*I plugged in the SSD from inside Ventura and cloned the contents using Carbon Copy Cloner, with a SATA-to-USB adapter.\n\n*I replaced the Apple HDD inside with the freshly-cloned SSD, but it wouldn't boot. I checked CCC's documentation and read that I could do a fresh install and then perform a Migration Assistant.\n\n*I booted into Internet Recovery, Disk Utilities, and formatted both the new SSD drive and the Apple SSD drive part of the Fusion Drive, thinking it wouldn't be needed anymore. I reinstalled Ventura from scratch successfully. No other data has been written to the Apple SSD.\n\nHere's what I tried to recover the data so far:\n\n*\n\n*Tested several data recovery utilities, like UFS Explorer, Disk Drill and R-Studio to no avail.\n\n*With the aforementioned Apple SSD to PCI-e adapter, connect both the old SATA HDD and the Apple SSD and mount them in R-Studio. No partitions were found.\n\n*I replaced the UUID from the formatted Apple SSD to match the one R-Studio found. (The HDD's UUID minus one) Also to no avail.\n\nMy idea was to find the correct structure of a working Fusion Drive APFS set and replace the partition IDs in the partition table of the SSD with the correct ones, so maybe that way I can access the data.\nI'm aware this is either difficult or near-impossible to fix, so please share your tips and ideas. Thank you.\n\nA: A Fusion Drive is one logical volume that spans two separate devices. (The size of the volume is the sum of both parts.)\nThe SSD is not a cache that duplicates data from the HDD: CoreStorage moves the most frequently used file blocks to the SSD.\nEven if you could get the HDD recognised and mounted by itself, you would be left with missing files (and even incomplete files).\nYou say you cloned the original SSD (I think). Can you restore that clone, and put the original drives back?\nIt's possible that some data recovery firm could reconstruct the data from both drives, but this is likely to be expensive.\nSorry.\nDoes the customer not have a backup? Most repair shops make the customer sign a waiver that their data may be lost.\nWhat happens when you remove (or lose) the SSD from a Fusion Drive?\n\nA: Unfortunately, I have to say you are out of luck. As @benwiggy stated in a comment below, if you do not have a, say, Time Machine backup, the data you have on your HD and its backup are unreadable and useless. Therefore, never, never do a carbon copy of an HD of a fusion drive. You need to back up both the SSD and the HD. If one of those is missing, you will lose all your data. The reason behind it is that, apparently, Apple Fusion Drive copies the most used blocks (and not files) to the faster SSD. Because it uses blocks and not files, data recovery is virtually impossible without both drives.\nNext time, please do a Time Machine backup before messing up with a fusion drive. I'm sorry, but this is the reality.\nIf you don't trust what I say here, just go to the experts and what @benwiggy explained about file fragmentation.\n", "Q: How to create shortcuts which only apply to a certain app?

Some time recently (possibly with the Ventura upgrade; I'm not sure) quicklook behaviour got worse.\nIn particular, *.tex (TeX/LaTeX) files stopped previewing entirely; instead they show a message\n\nThe extension com.apple.tips.TipsAppQuicklook-macOS does not implement file previews\n\nwhich seems to be weirdly trying to assign the quicklook to something related to \"Tips\".\nI note\n\n*\n\n*~/Library/Application\\ Scripts/com.apple.tips.TipsAppQuicklook-macOS exists, but it is an empty folder.\n\n*mdls -name kMDItemContentType <path to a *.tex file> gives kMDItemContentType = \"org.tug.tex\"\n\n*I think the previews used to be handled by TextMate which also showed full syntax-highlighted previews. TextMate still has an org.tex.tug entry in its Info.plist.\n\n*Preview icons are still shown correctly.\n\n*Most other text file types seem to work, albeit without syntax highlighting, with an \"Open with some app\" button on the top of the preview window, pointing to TextEdit, Xcode, Textmate, or even Emacs depending on the file type. (Emacs files seem to get syntax highlighting?!)\n\n*org.tug.tex does not appear in qlmanage -m plugins, although org.tug.tex.bibtex and org.tug.tex.dvi do.\n\n*There is no ~/Library/QuickLook directory.\n\n*I have tried qlmanage -r, qlmanage -r cache and a restart, to no avail.\n\nOther people have similar problems, as seen on tex.SE\nUpdate: This Apple support forum thread seems to have some more information. It implies that Apple has deprecated old quick look generators, but I don't think that this can be the whole problem, since it seems to work -- including via TextMate -- for some types.\nUpdate 2: not fixed in 13.1, alas.\nUpdate 3: This app seems to work as a quicklook previewer for a wide variety of file types, including TeX and CSS. (Thanks to this answer on the related thread.)\nAny ideas?\n\nA: So I have a sort-of answer to my own question.\nFirst the app at https://github.com/sbarex/SourceCodeSyntaxHighlight seems to fix it for me by explicitly providing quicklook for many types of text source files (perhaps too many!)…\nHowever, after installing it and then uninstalling it as a test, the “TipsAppQuicklook” message seems to go away for some — but not all! — file types, but still without actually showing the preview window.\nHaving noticed this behaviour after deleting the syntax highlighter app, I tried some more deletions. First, I deleted TextMate. Still no preview, but the button changed from \"Open with TextMate\" to \"Open with TeXShop\". So I deleted TeXShop.  And then... it worked (i.e., unhighlighted full window preview with an \"Open with Bbedit\" button)!\nBut I still wanted TextMate, so I reinstalled it (and TeXShop, although I really don't use it) and... it still worked! It still had \"Open with BBedit\" but I was able to change that with the \"Get Info\" dialog. It's not perfect: no syntax highlighting, and css files still don't show a preview, and it seems to be brittle regarding opening with BBEdit vs TextMate, which seems to sometimes cause it revert to the bad behaviour, but it might be an adequate solution (though I may actually go back to the new syntax-highlight app).\nClearly there is some dependence of all of this on the order of installation of the applications and how they register their capabilities which can result in clashes. I wonder if it's documented anywhere and if there are less sledgehammery ways to change how it works....\n", "Q: How to toggle Accessibility features with AppleScript in Ventura Applescripts for Ventura's new System Settings\nMy old Applescript stopped working on Ventura.

Is it already supported ?\n\nA: It is not Parallels 18 as such that supports that. It is a generic feature in Windows 11 for ARM.\nIt works in principle similar to how Rosetta 2 on the Mac works. Although with a different set of limitations, and a slightly different performance profile.\nFor Linux you cannot use Microsoft's software for running Intel programs on ARM. However, Apple has made their Rosetta 2 software available for running Intel programs inside Linux on Mac hardware.\nNote that this still requires you to install an ARM version of Linux, but you will be able to run your Intel Linux programs on that system. Similar to how you have installed Windows 11 for ARM that is capable of running Intel softare.\nAs far as I know, Parallels haven't made the process of using Rosetta 2 inside Linux inside Parallels super user friendly yet - but it will probably come soon.\nFor now you can use Apple's generic instructions here:\nhttps://developer.apple.com/documentation/virtualization/running_intel_binaries_in_linux_vms_with_rosetta\nAnd you can find helpful software (does not require Parallels) to get it working in practice here:\nhttps://github.com/diddledani/macOS-Linux-VM-with-Rosetta\n", "Q: How can I use a keyboard shortcut to switch focus to another display?

My question is about the functionality of this pane and where my data is being stored.\nI currently have iCloud Backups disabled and I am backing up my iPhone manually with the Apple Music application on my iMac, to my iMac (where I also have Time Machine).  I have a 128GB iPhone and would prefer my data to be left on the iPhone's local large 128GB storage, not placed in the iCloud (which is limited to 5GB of space), and backed up manually to my iMac using Apple Music Sync Backup.\nMy question is specifically about clicking on each of the applications featured in this pane, then clicking \"Delete Documents and Data\".\nWhen I click on an application, then \"Delete Documents and Data\", am I only deleting the documents and data from being synced to the iCloud storage system or am I deleting this data from my local 128GB of storage?  In other words, can I click \"Delete Documents and Data\" for all these apps listed and still back up my iPhone application data to my iMac using Apple Music app?\nI have heard that clicking \"Delete Documents and Data\" deletes the application data both in the iCloud and on my 128GB iPhone device's local storage.  If so, it seems in order for me to keep iBook data on my 128GB iPhone device, I am also forced to keep this data in the iCloud?  This implies that my 128GB device's local storage space is useless, unless I have a corresponding amount of iCloud space equivalent to it.\nFeatured Pane:\n\n\nA: These settings are very confusing and someone from the Apple Help Forums helped clear this up.  Here is the answer.\nThe iCloud settings under \"Settings->Apple ID->iCloud\" control synchronization of data between the device to iCloud. When an app is enabled using the slider, synchronization from device to iCloud is turned on. When an app is disabled, synchronization from device to iCloud is turned off. When synchronization is enabled, the data remains both in iCloud and on the device.\nManaging the iCloud storage under \"Settings->Apple ID->iCloud->Manage Storage\" offers the option to delete documents and data. When you select this option, data is deleted from both the iCloud and also from your device.\nTherefore, to save space on iCloud (5GB is offered for free), you should backup the device using \"Apple Music\" or \"iTunes\" synchronization and disable synchronization of relevant apps under \"Settings->Apple ID->iCloud\".  I left a few enabled in case I lost my iPhone and had to buy another one while away from my iMac or it's backups.  I specifically left Contacts, Calendars, Reminders, Notes enabled.  I suspect you might want to leave Messages enabled, but they can use much space especially if they contain pictures or videos.\n", "Q: What is CR8supplement in my Font Book? Should I delete it? I’m currently using my MacBook Pro with macOS Ventura installed, and a font file is bugging me. An installed font called CR8supplement. The font is sitting in my Font Book and, to be honest, I don’t even know what this is.\nLike the repertoire shows nothing but two poorly designed Apple logos (labeled nonmarkingreturn and dmacron) next to a checkmark (hilariously labeled as a plus sign).\n\nI don’t know what to do with this weird font. What is this font? Should I delete it or do something with it?\n\nA: I don't have this font, and it's not part of Ventura (AFAICT).\nIt looks like it's installed in the User fonts folder (being under \"My Fonts\" in Font Book), rather than the /Library or /System fonts folders.\n\nShould I delete it or do something with it?\n\nYour choices are: leave it as it is; disable it in Font Book; or delete/remove it.\nIf you delete it, at worst, something will display with missing glyph symbols. Because you have a backup, you can always restore it later.\n", "Q: Change AirPods Pro microphone level on Windows I have factory new AirPods Pro (1st Generation) and use them with an iPhone, which works perfectly fine. Audio quality is good as expected. On Windows 10, this is different. Audio output is good as expected, but the microphone level is so low (<20%, no matter how loud I talk), that the quality is just bad. Apps tend to adapt the level so heavily that I sound like I'm sitting in a tin can.\nThere's only one bluetooth device for input for output two (headset and hands-free). I'm only using the  headset one, as hands-free is mono audio and bad.\nI appreciate any hint how to change the microphone level natively, so that I can use them on Windows, too.\n\nA: From what I can tell, you cannot use stereo audio and a mic on Windows 10.\nThere are 2 Bluetooth drivers you can choose from:\n\n*\n\n*Headset - stereo audio, no mic\n\n\n*Hands-free - mono audio, low quality mic\nIf you select \"headset\" and you're taking into a mic, it's most likely using a mic built into the PC.\nTo change the input volume of a mic in Windows:\n\n*\n\n*Right click the Speaker icon in the task bar\n\n\n*Click \"Open Sound settings\"\n\n\n*Under Input, click \"Device Properties\"\n\nA: If you have the required hardware you should try upgrading to Windows 11 where they may have this issue fixed: https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2022/01/06/announcing-windows-11-insider-preview-build-22526/\n\nIf that doesn't help I'll have to be bold and suggest you try to clean some earwax from the AirPods Pro's.\n\nA: As noted by others, it is important to know that pairing your AirPods [Pro] with Windows will result in two sound devices being connected to Windows:\n\n*\n\n*Headphones: \"Your AirPods - Find My Stero\" - These should be used for listening to music on Windows.\n\n*Headset: \"Your AirPods - Find My Hands-Free AG Audio\" - These should be used when calling or joining meetings on Windows 10.\n\nFollow these steps to check and adjust the microphone levels of your AirPod Pros on Windows 10:\n\n*\n\n*Open the Settings app, select System, and then select Sound. (Alternatively, click Start and just type \"Sound\" to open the Sound settings directly.\n\n*Choose \"Headset (Your AirPods - Find My Hands-Free AG Audio)\"\n\n*Click the \"Device properties and test microphone\" link right below the drop-down selector for choosing your input (microphone) device.\n\n*Adjust the volume slider as necessary and test.\n\n\n\n\nA: By accident, I found out the solution via this German news article\nBasically, you have to remove all control over all microphones from the applications, including the Xbox Game Bar. Then Teams and other software do not try to regulate the microphone level of the AirPods and you'll get the usual quality\n\n*\n\n*Open sound settings from the control panel\n\n*Click on \"Sound Controls\" on the right side\n\n*An \"old Windows\" style dialog opens.\n\n*Select tab Input\n\n*Right click on any device and ensure that deactivated devices are displayed, too.\n\n*For each device listed do the following:\n6.a) double click, select tab Advanced\n7.a) Deselect Applications have exclusive control of the device\nDeactivate the XBox Game Bar, as this controls your mic levels, too.\nNow your AirPods should have a decent mic level.\n\n", "Q: System data storage is huge The system data on my mac is taking more than 110GB of space. Is this normal?\n\nThe ~/Library/Containers folder is 64G. Can I delete this folder?\nEdit:\nI installed OmnidiskSwiper, Its tells me that the folder Library has 110GB, but than show my only 12.5GB + 1.4GB. I don't understand where the files are.\n\n\nA: This should really be a comment to the original question but is an answer to why OmniDiskSweeper is not showing the full size of the Library folder. This really should be a different question.\nThe + by a directory size means that OmniDiskSweeper can't read all of it. You need to give it Full Disk Access\nFrom OmniDiskSweeper 1.14 release notes\n\nOmniDiskSweeper 1.14 now displays an indication of sizes which are incomplete due to system protections or file permission constraints. This release is a macOS Universal app, which can run natively on both M1-powered Macs and Intel-based Macs running macOS 11 Big Sur or later.\n\n...\n\nIncomplete Size Indicator — When OmniDiskSweeper cannot fully read the contents of a file or directory (due to system protections or file permissions), it places a + sign next to its size to indicate that the reported value is an incomplete, minimum value rather than the total size. (For example, a size of “1.8 GB+” indicates that the content OmniDiskSweeper was able to access was 1.8 GB, but there was additional content which OmniDiskSweeper was unable to read.) Incomplete sizes will always be sorted above complete sizes, since there’s no telling how large that content actually is.\n\n\nTo grant OmniDiskSweeper access to any files the current user can read, open Security Preferences in System Preferences, choose Full Disk Access, and add the OmniDiskSweeper app. (OmniDiskSweeper needs Full Disk Access to be able to scan your entire disk—otherwise, it can’t scan for files in your Trash among other locations. Information collected by OmniDiskSweeper is only used for the results displayed to you within the app; we do not track or store that data for use by anyone else anywhere else.)\n\n\nTo grant OmniDiskSweeper access to files not readable by the current user, open Terminal and use sudo to run OmniDiskSweeper as the root superuser. (To grant access to all files on your Mac, you’ll also need to grant Full Disk Access as noted above, since even the root superuser cannot access all files otherwise.) When doing this, please note that any files you trash from the app will go to root’s Trash (in ~root/.Trash) rather than the current user’s Trash.\n\nThe last point is not relevant here but is worrying as this was not needed before\n\nA: Apple's classification of file types here is quite broad, and not always accurate; but clearly something is using a lot of space.\nAs mentioned in this article: How can I figure out what's slowly eating my drive space?\nI would use something like OmniDiskSweeper to investigate what's using up all that space.\nI wouldn't delete ALL of ~/Library/Containers, but I'd certainly have a look what sub-folder is eating it up.\n", "Q: chmod +x not working as expected, running another tool instead Just wrote a simple commandline tool which works fine with swift but doesn't run as executable after chmod +x ...\nThis is happening on my system so might be configuration related but not sure how to resolve.\n\nCreate Script:\nvi test.swift\n\nEnter content:\nimport Foundation\nprint(\"Hello, World!\")\n\nRunning normally swift test.swift gives Hello, World! as expected but when I make it executable & run it then it's failing.\nMake Executable:\nchmod +x test.swift\n./test.swift\n\nOutput:\nVersion: ImageMagick 7.1.0-52 Q16-HDRI aarch64 20549 https://imagemagick.org\nCopyright: (C) 1999 ImageMagick Studio LLC\nLicense: https://imagemagick.org/script/license.php\nFeatures: Cipher DPC HDRI Modules OpenMP(5.0) \nDelegates (built-in): bzlib fontconfig freetype gslib heic jng jp2 jpeg lcms lqr ltdl lzma openexr png ps raw tiff webp xml zlib\nCompiler: gcc (4.2)\nUsage: import [options ...] [ file ]\n\nImage Settings:\n  -adjoin              join images into a single multi-image file\n  <redacted as unnecessary>\n\nBy default, 'file' is written in the MIFF image format.

This seems to resolve the external monitor connection issues for me.\n", "Q: MacOS Photos - How do you get facial recognition/tracking to start processing? I have been dealing with my photo library never getting processed for facial (people) recognition & identification. I'm running a Macbook Pro 2019 (currently Ventura 13.0, Photos 8.0), 6 core Intel processor and Radeon Pro GPU - lots of processing power available to do the job. All my photos are on my local SSD, not external. This has been occurring both in Monterrey as well as when I upgraded to Ventura. Apple keeps most of the photos process undocumented so it's a major pain to figure out what's happening...or why nothing is happening.\nI know the \"photoanalysisd\" process/engine is the primary analysis tool for all this kind of work. Regardless of what I do, it never generates any significant CPU time (more than a few seconds over a weekend) as shown by Activity Monitor.\nI've tried lots of suggestions like:\n\n*\n\n*Repairing my Photos library;\n\n*Resetting the faces database by deleting all the people in the \"People\" folder in Photos;\n\n*Disconnecting from iCloud Photos so everything is local;\n\n*Disabling all user-level background processes;\n\n*Seeding a couple of hundred photos with manual face tagging;\n\n*Rebooting the system with nothing else running, starting photos and then closing the app, confirming photoanalysisd was launched, letting it sit over the weekend, and ensuring the Mac never went to sleep while being plugged into power (this seems to help a lot of people);\n\n*Going \"scorched earth\" - Exporting all photos, deleting the old library and re-importing them to build a brand-new library;\n\n*Opening a support case with Apple and working it all the way up to level 4 support;\n\n*and lots of other attempts.\n\nBottom line, photoanalysisd hasn't accumulated any significant processing time, and no faces are even being detected, much less being identified or curated.\nSo how can I trigger face detection?\n\nA: (tldr:  Unplug your dang external monitor!)\nFinally, I decided to get as low as a level that Apple will allow in monitoring the photoanalysisd processing that was happening:\nFrom a terminal command prompt:\n\"ps -ef | grep photoanalysisd\" to get the PID of the photoanalysisd process (it's the 2nd number)\n\n\"log stream --level debug -p pid# > photos.log\" (pid# is the number from the step above)\n\nAfter letting that run for a few hours, I dug into that photos.log file and found this little gem:\ncom.apple.photoanalysisd.backgroundanalysis:C474F8:[\n\n{name: ThermalPolicy, policyWeight: 5.000, response: {Decision: Absolutely Must Not Proceed, Score: 0.00, Rationale: \\[{thermalLevel >= 2}\\]}\n\nWait, what?!? No programs are running, CPU & GPU are at less than 5%, yet it's not running because something is too hot? Heck, even my monitors have been blanked out for the last several hours!\nIn my personal setup, I've got 2 external monitors - one plugged directly into the mac, and one running off a USB hub. So, for shits & giggles I unplugged both external monitors. BAM! Within 2 minutes, photoanalysisd kicked into high gear. Overnight, it processed all 12,000 photos. Playing around a little more, it turned out I can leave the USB hub's monitor plugged in (while unplugging the directly-connected monitor) and the analysis process will still run. So, it appears that having an external monitor plugged directly into the Mac will trip some kind of thermal detection (GPU work, maybe?), and photoanalysisd won't allow itself to run.\n", "Q: Why does a resolution of 3008x1692 look clearer than each smaller until to 3840x2160? Today I discovered, that on my Dell 43 Ultra HD 4K Multi-Client Monitor P4317Q, the resolution between 3008x1692 to 3840x2160, looks terrible, not clear, has torn font, etc.\nWhy on a resolution below or equal to 3008x1692 fonts look very good, and clear? Can anybody explain it? Is it a bug on macOS?\n\nA: Your monitor has a pixel density of 102 pixels per inch. MacOS is 'optimized' for Hi-DPI displays with densities of over 160ppi. (Retina displays are between 220 and 260ppi.)\nMacOS no longer includes 'sub-pixel' rendering, which is needed to make low-density display look good. (There is a performance penalty in using it on hi-dpi displays, where it's unnecessary.)\nIf you've found a setting where the display looks good, then I would use it.\n", "Q: Using europlug adapter from Mag Safe 2 with the usb-c charger (US version) Can I use the europlug adapter from Mag Safe 2 with the usb-c charger (US version) to charge my MacBook pro 14?\n\nA: If you mean the actual interchangeable plug that connects to the 'brick:\n\nthen yes, that will work with anything that it can physically connect to.

I just upgraded to Ventura and trying to get used to some of the changes. I see that the Energy Saver settings are no longer under the Battery section of System Settings and instead are now part of the Lock Screen section. No big deal, it was easy enough to find the new location, but I can't seem to find anywhere to restore system defaults anymore.\nBefore updating, I had temporarily set my MacBook to never shut off the display on battery and I would like to restore the default settings now but am not sure how anymore.\n\nA: How about doing it from the Terminal?\nsudo pmset restoredefaults\n\nworks for me :-)\nQuoting bits from man pmset to provide some context:\n\npmset manages power management settings such as idle sleep timing, wake on administrative access, automatic restart on power loss, etc.\n\n", "Q: Show Finder item Modified / Created time with seconds in Ventura In previous version of Mac OS before Ventura, it was an easy fix to allow Finder and other applications to show date created / modified time including seconds with this method here: Can Finder show dates including seconds?\nSince updating my existing system that had these preference set now to Ventura, Finder no longer shows the seconds that items were created or modified and the options to highly customize time in the Region settings are missing.\nDoes anyone know a way around this?\n\nA: I believe I found a workaround based on the sources in the question link that was mentioned in my opening question.\nEntering the following in Terminal followed by Enter will make changes to ~/Library/Preferences/.GlobalPreferences.plist (this is a hidden file revealed with Cmd+Shift+. if manually browsed to in a Finder window via Go > Go to Folder)\ndefaults write -g AppleICUTimeFormatStrings -dict-add 1 \"hh':'mm':'ss' 'a\"\nAfter force-quit restarting the Finder, the desired time format with seconds is now working perfectly.\n\nA: @steve-m's solution works for all user accounts due to writing a key to the \"global domain\" of \"UserDefaults\".

Also, I do not want to schedule it because my shift hours alternate. Any Idea how I could get it done via the Tools or Actions app?\n\nA: You could use Apple's focus feature. By default you can find focus in the control center (swipe down from the top right corner) and it should have an option for a new focus, or you can customize/automate an existing focus. There should be an option to activate/deactivate based on a location. You might first need to set up your work location in your contact card.

It's extremely valuable!\n\nA: Absolute Paths\nUse an absolute (full) path to rclone in the command.\ncron executes commands in a simpler environment than when the same command is run from an interactive terminal session. This means most executables can not be found without their location being fully provided.\nTo find the path to rclone on your Mac, use the command:\nwhich rclone\n\nThe output will be the path to use. If you have installed rclone using the Homebrew package manager, the path will likely be:\n/usr/local/bin/rclone\n\nSee also cron and \"command not found\".\nTry testing the rclone command without the rm command:\n/usr/local/bin/rclone /Users/x123/Downloads/torrents mega:torrents -q\n\nGlobs\nThe * passed to rm will not be expanded; there is no shell involved to do the expansion. A shell script – with an absolute path – is likely easier to get working.\nShell Script\nConsider writing the commands as a shell script and have cron call the script.

Apple just wants you to be aware. The risk is that developer mode allows you to install apps that are not reviewed or signed by apple. It also enables other debugging features, available under developer settings that may modify the way the device behaves or provide access to data that would not otherwise be accessible\n\n*The primary risk is untrusted code execution, still within a sandbox, but untrusted/Unreviewed could exploit some vulnerability to escape the sandbox.

Sometimes listening to podcasts some people are loud, others quiet, and I have to keep changing the volume throughout the conversation.\nIs it possible to via command line or other means compress and limit all audio coming out of the system to a fixed or very small range of volume?\nI want to turn it on and off when needed.\nNot for post-processing audio files. It's to use live.\n\nA: You need some kind of compressor…\nApple provides some by default as Audio Unit plugins - but you then need something to run them in. The simplest I know of is Rogue Amoeba's SoundSource [Rogue Amoeba really do make some very solid sound manipulation tools, this is about their cheapest/simplest.]\nYou can then 'intercept' the output at either System or application level & insert the compressor to control the output.\n\nA multiband compressor is not the easiest thing to juggle the settings of, if you're not used to audio engineering [& the Apple one doesn't have the best graphical representation to see what you're doing]. If you struggle, there's a simpler single-band comp called AUDynamicsProcessor.\nSoundSource can run any Audio Unit plugin, so you might be able to find another compressor more suited to your specific needs. There are a lot available, free & paid. An alternative type of compressor is known as a Limiter [sometimes called a brick-wall limiter], which in effect holds an absolute maximum output & won't let anything be louder. They can be very effective, but also very aggressive in how they affect the sound.\nThe SoundSource app sits in the menu bar, so you can toggle it with a couple of clicks.\nPersonally, my multiband of choice is the Waves LinMB [Linear Phase Multiband Compressor] which lets you see as well as hear what you're doing- but that's another $30 on top of SoundSource.\n\n", "Q: Apple apps can't connect to the internet after upgrading to macOS Ventura My father just updated his laptop to macOS Ventura, and now apps from Apple are unable to do anything that requires a network connection. It's not a general internet issue since Chrome and Firefox work as expected, so I assume it's related to how Apple's own apps handle the connection. Neither Safari, nor the App Store, nor the Software Updates section in settings are able to lmake a connection to the internet.\n\nA: It turned out to be Norton 360, which I did not know was installed on his mac.\n", "Q: Notes app: search inside scanned document How do I get to the detailed search result within a camera scanned document in the Notes app?\nIf I create a note on my iPhone, and use the camera to \"scan\" a document, it looks like the content of the document is searchable by the global search in the Notes app on my Mac and iPhone. But how do I find the exact location within that document? There appears to be no highlight of the search result, nor any way to search within that document.\nIs there an obvious trick that I am missing? Even if I open the attached document in a new window, there is no search interface at all.\nI am using macOS Ventura and iOS 16.1.1\n\nA: There is a way to find the position of a text in scanned images, but it doesn't involve the Notes app. Instead, go to the Home screen on your iPhone and pull down / swipe down to bring up the search screen.\n\nType in your search term – hits from other apps, incl. photos found in apps come up. (Some image results redacted here)\n\nSelect \"Show More >\" on the right, a more detailed screen with the photos from the respective app is shown. The icon in the lower right of each image preview shows that the text you searched for has been recognised in this image.\n\nSelect an image.\n\nClose up of the found text within the image.\n\nHowever, to my knowledge there is no seeking of found text in scanned images in the Notes app. Nevertheless, you can scan text into a note when you capture the image. The process is described here.\nHow to scan text into a note\n\n*\n\n*In a note, tap the Camera button, then tap Scan Text.\n\n\n*Position iPhone so that the text appears within the camera frame. Once the yellow frame appears around detected text, it gets added to the note. You can also tap a different area of text for the yellow frame to appear around that.\n\n\n*You can then either tap \"Insert\" to add that text to the note and close the camera, or tap the Live Text button. The latter option allows you to select specific text within the detected text frame. Then tap \"Insert\" to insert that text to the note.\n\nI agree that this isn't perfect when you need to scan a lot of text. Given your problem I assume you'd have taken a number of photos with text. To pinpoint where a searched and found text is however, it needs to be in text form not text in an image.\nIf you already have a number of photos with text in them, you can hit the Live Text button and copy that text, then paste it either below all these photos, or in a separate note, which you can then search over. Again, not ideal. I understand it would've been much better if photos with scanned text would be treated just like text, but Apple hasn't implemented that function (yet).\nMaybe you will need an external app to master that. While I haven't tested this, it seems that Photos Search does what you're looking for. The preview video shows a contextual menu entry \"Show Text\", which looks like it does what you're looking for:\n\n", "Q: Run AppleScript when notification is receieved I have a script that runs perfectly but I want it to initialise when I receive a notification with the title \"Bricks + Agent\".

I figured out something so I can auto-dismiss those annoying persistent updates available notifications (which happen regardless of auto-update settings), but apparently the Applescript functions for notifications change vastly between OS versions. My solution is not really \"act when receiving a notification\", but rather it constantly checks visible notifications for certain strings. That's pretty much the best you can do with just Applescript. It should work fine on at least Monterey and possibly anything newer.\nThe top part is some config, then at the very bottom I've added a comment to indicate where you would add your handling. You should probably just read through the entire script anyway. =] As a bonus I've also included the auto-dismiss functionality, which should be language independent.

I have \"smart\" quotes turned off in my System Preferences, because I hate having a computer that thinks it is smarter than me, and it breaks so many things.  But for some reason the Messages app has decided to ignore my explicitly stated preferences, and automatically change normal quotation marks to so-called \"smart\" quotes.\nI also looked in the Preferences of the Messages app, and there is nothing there that mentions \"smart\" quotes.  So neither system-wide nor app-specific preferences are the issue.\nNone of the current questions that appeared in a search answer my question:\n\n*\n\n*I'm not using TextEdit\n\n*or BBEdit\n\n*I'm not asking how to do this dynamically\nHow can I make Messages stop spitting in my face and use exactly what I typed and not what its programmers think I should have typed?\n\nA: As an addendum to the very useful answer from Tetsujin,\nIn Messages, there are actually 2 places \"smart\" quotes are set, so besides unchecking Edit → Substitutions → Smart Quotes, you also need to open the dialog box at Edit → Substitutions → Show Substitutions and uncheck\n\n\nUnfortunately this is an extremely buggy part of the app, and Messages might re-check the \"smart\" quotes checkbox after you uncheck it.

So, for every text replacement that uses quotation marks—whether single or double—I've had to create a duplicate version with \"smart\" quotes.\nMessages didn't use these until I restarted it.\nIf someone comes up with a better solution I will definitely choose theirs over my workaround.\n\nA: Many Apple apps, including Messages, have their own individual settings for smart quotes in Edit > Substitutions\n\nThese are not governed by the global pref.\n[In such as TextEdit, it's actually saved at document-level.]\n", "Q: macOS Server: How to remove self-signed root from website SSL cert chain? macOS 10.13.6, Server.app 5.6.3\nI'm using LetsEncrypt SSL certs.

When you set an arm64 app to Open Using Rosetta, you're just using the Intel code segment.\nSo there's no difference between an app that only has Intel code, running in Rosetta, and an app with both architectures that's set to run in Rosetta.\nThe main drawbacks to using Rosetta are performance and efficiency. ARM code runs faster, and uses less Energy.\n\nA: The primary drawbacks to always running applications in Rosetta (translated to ARM from Intel) are as follows:\n\n*\n\n*When you run the binary for the first time, there is a delay to translate the binary to native ARM. This happens continually if the Intel application uses Just In Time code.\n\n*Running the translated version may not be as efficient as a native application.\n\n*Without doubt, it will use more power.\n\n*\n\nRosetta translates all x86_64 instructions, but it doesn’t support the execution of some newer instruction sets and processor features, such as AVX, AVX2, and AVX512 vector instructions. If you include these newer instructions in your code, execute them only after verifying that they are available. For example, to determine if AVX512 vector instructions are available, use the sysctlbyname function to check the hw.optional.avx512f attribute.\n\n\n\n*\n\nRosetta does not raise floating point exceptions. While you might think this would only affect floating point operations in Lisp, it in fact also affects rational arithmetic and, possibly, bignums. (If you run the ANSI test suite, you get a large number of failures in its arithmetic tests.)\n\n\n\n*In the case of some things like Homebrew, the Intel version may look for application support files in a different directory.\n\n", "Q: How to disable link previews and link dropdowns Since updating to Ventura, whenever I paste or type a URL into an email draft, Mail app now automatically crowds my message with large content previews, it pings websites and downloads images to add as attachments to my email drafts, and it displays distracting dropdown carets next to every existing URL.\nIs there any way to disable any or all of these unwanted new features, either by GUI pref or Terminal command? Thank you.\n\nA: In Ventura pasted links in Mail appear to have following behavior:\n\n*\n\n*pasted link is \"Link Preview\" if e-mail body is empty or link is not pasted after and next to any text\n\n*pasted link is \"Plain link\" if it's pasted immediately after any text/character in e-mail body (one character is sufficient)\n\nDropdown caret pop-up window enables switching from one link type to another and opening link (as clicking on link itself does nothing). For the latter functionality I am skeptical about possibility to remove it.\nWorkaround is to use ⌘+K and paste link into pop-up window (or paste link between () or convert existing text into link). Dropdown caret will still be there.\n\nA: Setting the email compositions to plain text prevents this feature from being applied:\nMail > Settings > Composing > Message format: Plain Text\n", "Q: `grep` ignoring line breaks I have been using Ventura for about two weeks.  Commands that worked yesterday do not work today.\nMy procedure: edit each .gpx file created without line breaks by a Garmin eTrex 30.  Put each tag on its own line so that a mapping application I use will accept it.  Then to see the time periods each file tracks,\nfor GPX in *gpx; do                                 \n  echo $GPX\n  grep time $GPX | head -1\n  grep time $GPX | tail -1\n  wc $GPX\n  echo \"=======\"\ndone\n\nThis has worked fine until today.  Now, it looks like there are still no line breaks in any file—including the ones created another way that always had line breaks.  If I open a file in TextEdit, each tag is on its own line as I expect. If I check with od -xc, I see that the line breaks are \\n and there are no \\r.\nI exited Terminal and all other programs (except Finder), closed all windows, and restarted.  Logged in, opened Terminal, cd to the directory, and tried again. Same result.\nWhat happened?  How do I fix it?\n\nA: Found it.  Some odd glitch, perhaps in TextEdit, appended a huge portion of the pre-edited file to the end of the edited version in two of the files.  That line was so big, of course, that I could not see the single lines from the head when those two files were the last two in the for loop.\nOnce I discovered that, I deleted that line, and the error did not recur.\n", "Q: XCode v12.4 refuses to open I am new to Mac.\nI installed XCode v12.4, on my Mac Mini with Mac OS 10.15.7.

I use my laptop for work and I don't want to risk incompatibilities. I have been burned before.\nHowever, there are some features of apple mail that I would like to use, hence the question.\n\nA: Most of the application 'features' that Apple introduces are not part of the  application itself!\nThe features are added to the Operating System, and the new app then calls on those features.\nSo it is extremely unlikely that a new app could work on an old system.\nHowever, as for 'incompatibilities': the risk is very low when moving from one OS to the next one; but it increases as the delta change increases.(e.g. jumping from a much older OS to much newer one.)\nIt is always important to make sure that the software you use has compatible updates for the latest OS before you upgrade. The easiest way of doing this is by staying up-to-date.\nWhile staying fixed on one OS version, and not upgrading, will give you a 'stable' system, if you ever need to update something (--and you will--), then the whole thing will need tearing down and replacing.\nSoftware is like a house plant: it needs constant maintenance to survive.\n", "Q: cannot update MacBook Air to Monterey from Big Sur I have a Macbook Air (11-inch, Early 2014) currently running the latest version of MacOS Big Sur (as of the time of this posting) 11.7.1.\nI am regularly getting on-screen notifications that MacOS Monterey is ready to be downloaded and installed, but when I click the notification (or manually navigate to System Preferences -> Software Update), the only message I receive is Your Mac is up to date - MacOS Big Sur 11.7.1.\nThis has been going on for months now - since MacOS Monterey was first made available to my machine.

I am looking to 'restore' an old iOS game (Mega Jump)—it was unfortunately never updated with a 64-bit release, so can't be run on any iDevices running iOS 11 or later. This isn't an obstacle for me personally, as I'm just looking to download the app and have access to its internal app files (i.e. game assets... for old time's sake :P).\nWithout access to an old mobile device running iOS 10 or earlier, is it possible to download 32-bit apps onto my non-jailbroken iPhone/iPad (iOS 16 and iOS 12.5.6 respectively), or onto my M1 Mac? I am doubtful about any iOS devices, but gaining access to files which are clearly still on the App Store (and which I purchased with my own Apple ID years ago) seems like it might be more viable on a Mac today?\n(Note: this developer has not removed their iOS apps from the Mac App Store, i.e. Mega Jump \"needs to [be updated] to work with your version of macOS\" and an updated game by the same developer, Mega Run, still works.)\nAm I out of luck? Is contacting the (more or less defunct) developers and gently nudging/begging for a 64-bit release my only option, besides shelling out for an iPad Mini 2 or iPad 4 which may not last more than a year? [Counterpoint: if all I need is to download and copy files from an outdated app, I may be able to borrow a family or friend's old device, but it would be good to know if other options exist.]\n\nA: \nWithout access to an old mobile device running iOS 10 or earlier, is it possible to download 32-bit apps\n\nNo. There isn't a public directory of urls for older versions of an application.\nIt is in the realm of possibility, that you could use an old version of Xcode on an old version of macOS installed inside a VM on your M1 using UTM. (This alone will be complicated and take hours to set up). Once you are on a version of Xcode that has an iOS emulator supporting iOS 10. You may be able to download it to the phone.\nMaking use of the application may also be difficult. Apple discontinued 32 bit apps in iOS 11. So even if you found the binary, you can't run it on any iOS 11+ device. Apple also discontinued 32 bit apps on Catalina, so you can't run it on an M1 system.\n", "Q: Shutdown error codes on Macbook What does shutdown error code -59 on Macbook air mean?

I use the \"Send email to [name of group]\" option in Mac Contacts. It's fast , efficient, and organized.\nI have run into a problem when I add a contact to Contacts group. Instead of adding a reference to a new list, the software actually removes the contact from any other group that it is in and adds it to the new group. In effect, it \"moves\" rather than \"copies\" or makes a reference.\nI need to build multiple mailing lists (groups) and some people I'm mailing to need to be on different lists for different reasons.\nIs this possible?\nContacts is Version 2536, on Ventura 13.0\n\nA: I think that I have discovered the problem. It's not tested, but it's an educated assumption.\nThe lists that I created are on a computer at a work location I am contracting at. This company—against all good advice—uses a Microsoft Exchange server. Per the Apple support webpage:\n\nIf you use an Exchange account in Contacts, those contacts can belong\nto only one folder at a time. Any contacts that aren’t in a folder you\ncreate are in the default Exchange Contacts folder.\n\nThis explains the behaviour that I did not expect.\nOh well. I will work around this issue.

The cylindrical Mac Pros (2013 model year) are inexpensive as used machines.  Can one develop Apple Silicon software on intel Macs or otherwise produce faster development in Xcode than the M1 Mac mini available at the $700 price point in the US?\n\nA: Since that Pro was discontinued, Apple has dropped support (officially) macOS Ventura so you will likely want to develop on the latest hardware even if you can make it work short term with current Xcode versions. I have both models that are in the question (via edit) and can say that the M1 mini runs circles around the Pro which will help me for running legacy software and older builds but would in no way be my primary machine or one I could recommend unless you had a fleet of machines for testing and running special code on those GPU or special compilers and not \"general Xcode\" use.\n", "Q: MacOS Ventura Date Format Broken In System Settings, General, Language & Region, Date format, I choose year/month/day.\nBut Finder still shows dates in confusing month/day/year.\nThis was not a problem prior to updating macOS to Ventura.

Ventura hangs intermittently on external monitor clamshell mode Ever since I upgraded my MacBook Pro 16 inch to Ventura it hangs intermittently when being used on external monitor in clamshell mode. I have to open the laptop and hard restart.\nThe problem becomes more prominent when it goes into to sleep mode. It comes up, goes to login screen and then hangs.\nIs anybody else facing this problem and is there any setting as workaround till the fix?\n\nA: I have observed that my external monitor was connected via USB C and Display Port. For the past few days I have changed to HDMI and the problem does not seem to be happening, however my monitor refresh rate has now dropped to 60 Hz from 100Hz...\nSeems it is an issue with Mac OS Ventura with direct USB C port external display connectivity.\n", "Q: Mac Catalina - Disk Recovery Partitioning - 2 or 1 I have a Mac, which was running Catalina. For some reason the disk corrupted itself and I needed to rebuild it.\nI've done some googling and have also spoken with Apple Support, but got conflicting information.\nI'm not a Mac expert, but do have a lot of experience working with OSs at low levels.\nI also have many months' worth of Time Machine archives.\nFrom memory, the disk had 2 partitions, one for the OS and one for data.  This was confirmed by Apple Support.  I can't find any info about this config on Google, which only mentions a single partition.\nI'm used to the idea of an OS disk and data disk, that's how I structure my Linux boxes.\nWhat I can't find are sizes and types. Apple Support could not tell me about those. I'm thinking that the OS partition should be small may be 240G (that works well for Linux) and the data uses the rest of the disk.\nDisk Utilities in recovery (Cmd+R) basically lets me choose FAT, Ex-FAT and the normal Apple types. When I tried booting I got the white screen with the \"no entry sign\". I then booted using Cmd+R and ran Disk Repair. It mentioned EFI, which again I'm used to, but could not find an option to let me select EFI as a type.\nWould someone please tell me what partitions I need and how to create them from a Cmd+R boot?\nI could spilt this into a few different questions each asking about a specific point but they will lead back to the overall question/request for the info above.\nNot sure if this is relevant or a different issue. Please assume I go for the 2-partition model.\nMy Time Machine shows me 2 options from the drop-down list, one for OS and one for data.\nI choose a date and restored the OS archive to the OS partition.\nThat worked and it rebooted itself and went to recovery menu.\nI then got to restore from TM, selected the same date and restored the data to the destination of the data partition. It runs for a while, maybe 10 - 15 mins, then opens a dialog saying errors and reboots.\nI've tried this for several dates.  As I say, not sure if it's all connected to the original question or not.\nThanks for any help\nJeff.\n\nA: Recent versions of macOS (starting with Catalina) automatically create two volumes within a single partition. The ability to have multiple volumes sharing space within a single partition is new in the APFS file system, and it means you don't have to preallocate space -- they can independently grow and shrink, as long as the total doesn't exceed the partition size.\n(It actually creates more than two volumes -- there's a read-only system volume, a user data volume, a VM/swap volume, an emergency Recovyer volume, ...)\nAnyway, the main thing is that you don't have to pre-partition the disk. Just format it in APFS, and let the installer take care of the rest.\n\nA: This is what my current setup is for Ventura – assuming it's not too different from Catalina:\n\nWhen I view the partition map however, I do see two extra (smaller) volumes, Container Disk1 (524 MB) and Container Disk2 (5.37 GB).\n\n\nFrom what I know (or know to believe) container volumes were introduced in High Sierra as part of APFS \"to define a storage system that can share available free space among one or more volumes. […] It allows volumes that are within a common container to grow or shrink as needed, without any type of repartitioning.\" (Source) The different space allocations result from physical disk layouts and space is freed up like any other disk - by erasing unneeded files. I think these are automatically created.\nThe main partition however is the Macintosh HD:\n\nSo, in summing up, you don't have to partition your drive. If it's an SSD format it as AFPS. There is some argument over whether hard drives should remain HFS+.\n", "Q: Java application connection to the internet blocked when using a different WiFi I am using dBeaver to connect to some databases that are at AWS.\nFrom home this works fine, but when I connect to my mobile hotspot these databases time out when connecting.\nFirst I assumed that these were some AWS security settings, because I was on a different IP. But then I found that when I startup a command prompt I can connect using psql, so this means that it is a local problem. I have a different application that uses jdbc to connect to the database, and that application also has the same behavior.\nAnyone know where this traffic might be blocked, or how to find out where? I already tried disabling the Mac Firewall, but that gave no positive result.\nSystem: Apple M1 Pro - Ventura\n\nA: Figured it out!\nI had installed UTM, which was doing some network bridging that was in the way. After uninstalling it, network connections from Java applications work again!\n", "Q: Can I submit my app built with Xcode 12.4? I am building my app on a old Mac wich can only run Xcode 12.4\nOn Apple's Submit page it says:\n\nPlease note, starting April 2023, all iOS and iPadOS apps submitted to the App Store must be built with Xcode 14.1 and the iOS 16.1 SDK.\n\nAnd on the Apple Developer News page it says:\n\nStarting April 25, 2022, iOS, iPadOS, and watchOS apps submitted to the App Store must be built with Xcode 13, which includes the SDKs for iOS 15, iPadOS 15, and watchOS 8.\n\nDoes that mean I have to buy a new mac to build & submit my app?\n\nA: If you're a paid developer, you might get better help directly from Apple, but the minimum SDK train continues to march onwards.\nWhether you can virtualize, rent, find another way to comply with the checks Apple puts up depends on your creativity and tolerance to spend time instead of money. The easy solution is a new kit and upgrading to the latest Xcode within 6 months of general release so you don't have to find all the new SDK and Xcode bugs, but also don't get shut out when these deadlines are communicated.\nIn practice, the new apps tend to get the closest reading of the \"rules\" and there's some grace period for updates to existing apps and usually a longer one for apps not getting an update, but even an old existing app will eventually need to get work put into it to port / test / rebuild and add the new metadata being requested / required by Apple to sell through their software stores.\nI can't see any way you can avoid change and continue to use Xcode 12.4 looking at the Q4 / 2022 situation.\n", "Q: Mac OS “sandbox” on Mac OS I need to test some signing/notarization issues with Gatekeeper and I need a completely “new” and “fresh” system for that so that I can test the app like a completely new user.\nIs there an easier way for that than virtualizing a Mac on a Mac? I tried just creating a new user on my local machine, but it turns out the users share the certificates - means I can not test the issue this way since the app launches without issues because of the certificates and previous launching of the app.\n\nA: No, that would be the easiest way. Some Gatekeeper dependencies such as for example certificates, trusts, invalidations, etc. are kept globally.\nAs you mention, just creating a new user account is not enough to get a factory-default environment - instead you would have to stop/start daemons and replace various files. It would be a lot of trouble.\nIf you're running on an older Mac and your tets are relatively long running, it might be easier to simply dual-boot macOS to get a fresh environment (i.e. run another installation of macOS from an external USB drive for example). It would require you to write over that external drive every time you need to start from scratch, so starting over is a more length process in comparison to simply reverting a virtual machine to a previously saved snapshot with a factory-default environment.\n", "Q: Apple's Reminders app: How do you deal with completed tasks? I just realised that I've never used Apple's app Reminders as it would deserve to be used, because I've never completely understood his way of managing completed tasks.\nI mean:\n\n*\n\n*I create a reminder.\n\n*I complete it and it disappear.\n\n*It doesn't really disappear, it's just hidden in the completed list.\n\nIf I would use Reminders for every thing I'd need it, I would accumulate thousands of completed tasks every year. What's the point of keeping all them there?\nShould I cancel them manually? But should I cancel them 1 by 1, or all together in one shot? Why not setting a default cancellation time, like Notes or vocals on iMessage.\nOr should I keep them all as a memory? Wouldn't them, slowly slowly, fill up my 5gb free iCloud storage?\nAm I missing something? What's your way of dealing with completed tasks?\n\nA: You can clear them out, either only older than a month or all tasks.\nOn macOS, at the top of the list under the title you'll see \"X Completed • Clear\". You can click Clear and you'll get asked which ones you want to delete.\nOn iOS, click the (•••) menu and \"Show Completed,\" then you'll see the same \"X Completed • Clear\" text under the title. Clicking it will show the same menu as on macOS.\nYou will not easily fill up your iCloud Storage. Simply clear the list every once in a while and you'll never get close.\n", "Q: How to search within the area on the map? If I open Apple Maps on my Mac, find my way to a city where I'm going to pick someone up in a few days, and then do a search for \"Fast Food\" (so I can find a convenient meeting place nearest to a given junction of 2 highways), Apple Maps very annoyingly searches near me instead of (more logically) near the area on the map.\nIt's hard to believe the designers at Apple are so out-of-touch that they have not ever thought that someone would want to search the area displayed on the map, so it seems like there must be some way to do this.\nHow can I search for things in the area shown in the map?\n\nA: It appears that if you click a search result with the caption \"Search Nearby,\" it will search in your area.\nHowever, after doing the search you can adjust the viewport and the search will update automatically to the new viewport.\n", "Q: Is my 12-hour power too high? In Activity Monitor, I'm seeing this:\n\nIs 1k/900 too much power? I believe I know what is causing it-- but will this increase my power bill?\nThanks.\n\nA: That column for 12 hour power is supposed to be in watts. Using 1 thousand watts per 12 hours is not a lot of power.\nThat is about 2 kilowatt hours (kwh) a day. Your local power cost is likely between 9 cents (0.09 USD) to 50 cents (0.50 USD) per kwh. So that is costing you roughly $0.18 USD to $1 USD per day.\n", "Q: Script to group and sort folder contents I'm trying to make a button on finders toolbar that will group the open folders items by kind and sort by name.

We just registered the company domain on Apple Business Manager and enabled federation.\nA lot of co-workers used their work email for iCloud already and are now asked to migrate those \"personal\" accounts.\nClearly those accounts are not personal and the workflow to migrate those accounts is really clunky and confusing.\nIs there a way to just tell Apple that those accounts should be left alone and just enable SSO on them?\n\nA: I have never heard of this being added since Apple will generate a new AppleID for each account that fails to self-migrate within 60 days. Plan on this being a total / on-time / no exceptions exercise now that you've exerted ownership on your domain with Apple ID services.\n\n*\n\n*https://discussions.apple.com/thread/252362033\nSince managed Apple ID have some serious limitations for most people, they will want to make a new \"personal\" ID or just keep using the new assigned ID which will then free your business up to assign that \"reserved\" ID for work purposes.\n\ncan’t use Apple Pay, no Find My, can’t add HomeKit devices, no purchasing from App Store, iTunes Store, Apple Books\n\nSince you have a business relationship with Apple, you might contact your support engineer / sales team in case there are undocumented / new features that could help. My expectation is you can't undo this and your employees will all have to take action to keep using their \"personal\" accounts - even if it's to sign in with their old / existing password with the new assigned random email Apple will assign them shortly.\n", "Q: MacOS Safari not loading webpages with internet connection After waking my macbook from sleep, sometimes Safari will not load any webpage - it starts loading and just gets stuck.

Switching to iPhones hotspot also does not work, still no connection. Switching wifi on and off - still nothing. Connecting via wifi, router works as on my other computer and iPhone internet works. The only way to resolve this is a full reboot of my mac, after which Safari starts working again like a charm.\nIs there anything I could try to fix this issue without needing a full reboot every couple of days?\n\nA: Try running softwareupdate -land if you see any update reading Label: Safari ....

However I should feel safe since if anything goes wrong, I can simply bring the small SSD back and everything should run as before.\nSo I wonder if I could just\n\n*\n\n*clean the 1TB (how exactly don't know), so the MBP aks for a system to install/migrate from\n\n*switch them around (1 TB goes to B, 256 GB goes to A)\n\n*start MacBook B and let it migrate from A (old SSD).\n\nWhat if something goes wrong?\nIf Macbook A was started with the small SSD to serve as a migration host, will it change anything on the SSD which may prevent it from run properly when switched back?\nAny other suggestions?\nAnything to have in mind, maybe from OS perspective?\nThanks\n\nA: I'd take these actions:\n\n*\n\n*Swap out the physical SSDs.\n\n*Boot the working laptop (now with the 1TB) using Internet Recovery with Command (⌘)-R.\n\n*Install macOS and use migration assistant from the other laptop.\n\nYou could use WiFi to migrate, but best speed would come from using a data cable (Thunderbolt) to connect them.\nMigration is a read only operation. Well, any writes will be a result of the system booted not the migration.\n", "Q: How do I modify the folder screenshots are saved to in this AppleScript in Automator?

They are \"to the right\" of any numbered Spaces, & the order, as far as I've ever been able to discern, is 'random' [order created].\nYour workaround is to maximise the window [hover the cursor in a window corner then when you see it change to a double diagonal arrow, double-click], rather than fullscreen it.

I’ve been experimenting with MimeStream as my email client and I generally like it. I did the thing of going into Mail’s preferences¹ to change the default email program so most of the time everything works as expected.\nExcept that one of my occasional workflows is to email a PDF of a document by selecting “Send in Mail” from the PDF menu at the bottom of the print dialog. This opens Mail.app and not Mimestream to send the email. Is there anywhere I can change this so that it will use my preferred email client?\n\n\n*\n\n*It seems bizarre that this setting lives there and not in the System Settings app.\n\n\nA: Put an alias of your mail app in ~/Library/PDF Services. (If the folder does not exist, you can create it.)\nYour alias will then appear in the PDF drop-down menu of the print dialog, and the OS will pass the PDF to your app.\n(In fact, the \"Send in Mail\" item is also just an alias to Mail.app.)\nYou can rename the alias to \"Send in MimeStream\" or whatever you like.\n", "Q: Karabiner elements: key not appearing in \"Simple modification\" list TL,DR: How do I swap \"<\" and \"²\" on an AZERTY keyboard ?\nContext\nI'm running macOS Ventura 13.0.1. I have an MS Natural Keyboard 4000 with an AZERTY layout. The physical key at the right of the left-most Shift has a \"<\" and a \">\" sign printed on it. The physical key at the top of the left Tab key has a \"²\" printed on it. For some reason, pressing the key with a \"<\" displays a \"²\", and vice-versa. I would like to swap the keys.\nAttempts\nApparently, there is no built-in way to do that in macOS Ventura 13.0.1, so I installed Karabiner-Elements which advertises as an application to do just that.\nI was hoping that following the Configure Simple Notification documentation would help; unfortunately, I cannot find any keys in the Add item list that matches the \"<\" key. (I was hoping for any \"lower_than\", \"less_than\", \"left_xxxx\" key but cannot find them in the list.)\nI then switched to Configure Complex Modifications, which opens a browser to lookup a rule; however, none of the rules seem to match (and it does not seem like searching for \"<\" is supposed to help.)\nNext steps ?\nAm I just missing the name of the \"<\" key in plain sight? Do I need to configure Karabiner to expose keys for AZERTY keyboards? Is it a specific issue with this keyboard? Should I manually edit the ~/.config/karabiner/karabiner.json, and in which case, which section should I change, to which value?\n\nA: The name of the key that has a \"<\" sign on it, is, obviously, \"non_us_backslash\".\nR.I.P Fred Brooks.\n", "Q: MacBook 2014 thunderbolt 2 I was wondering if there any use of thunderbolt 2 ports in MacBook Pro nowadays. There are hubs and docks for thunderbolt 3, not for thunderbolt 2. And  2014-2015 macbook pros have 2 thunderbolts... are they good for anything other than connecting an external display to them?\n\nA: Yes, there is use for Thunderbolt 2. Recall that Thunderbolt 2 supports throughput of 20Gps, which is 40x faster than the USB2 on your Macbook. USB3 can do similar, but in most cases does not. So, if you need to transfer many gb of files, photos, or do a backup, Thunderbolt is the way. In addition, Thunderbolt can support your monitor, Ethernet and USB over the one single connection (such as using a thunderbolt dock).\nEven better, Apple makes a Thunderbolt 2 to 3 adapter, so it can work with the Thunderbolt 3 docks and devices:\nhttps://www.apple.com/shop/product/MMEL2AM/A/thunderbolt-3-usb-c-to-thunderbolt-2-adapter\n\nA: It is hard to find TB2 devices and adapters now, but there were USB adapters, Ethernet adapters and hubs.\n\nA: You may be able to find things on eBay like RAID enclosures for TB2, at a cheap price secondhand. You may need to replace the drives at some point, but that's what RAID is all about.\nThe old Apple Thunderbolt Display is tailor-made for the TB2 port, and is probably a lot cheaper now the new Studio Display is out. That is a glorified TB hub, with Ethernet, FireWire and USB2 ports.\nApple did make a TB2-to-Ethernet adaptor, which might still be useful, if you can find one.\nA TB2 cable is also the fastest way to connect two Macs of that vintage together, if you need to copy files between them.\nI certainly wouldn't invest too heavily in TB2 gear, though, depending on how many more years you think you're going to get out of your 2014 Mac.\n", "Q: How to symlink Mac OS' own folders (Monterey)? I am looking for a way to accomplish the following on Monterey (12.6):\nIn the past I would symlink some Mac OS system folders (Documents, Downloads and Desktop) to folders already synced to a Synology NAS and have the \"links\" act like the \"original Mac OS folders. What I want is to have these files exist on the NAS and not on the local storage: Two Macs, same (synced) files in the the local folders.\nFor clarification - my question is not about how to sync stuff with the Syno NAS, it's how to have already synced folders act like the original user folders „Documents“, „Downloads“ and „Desktop“\nActual setup: The „SynologyDriveFolder“ is the permanently synced (remote) folder from the Syno NAS sitting somewhere under ~user/ which is holding the remote folders „Documents“, „Downloads“ and „Desktop“ (via the up and running SynologyDrive service).\nThey should act as the „real“ system folders on each Mac to choose from, especially in the „Save as…“ dialogue and I want to place them in the Finder’s sidebar as „the only“ „Documents“, „Downloads“ and „Desktop“ folders (no issue with saying goodbye to the original Mac OS folder icons for the specific folders)\nUnder Mojave it was super straightforward: Made Symlink of „remote“ folder (in my case  ~user/me/SynologyDriveFolder/Documents/), placed Symlink in Macintosh HD/user/me/  and renamed original „Documents“ to something different. Done.\nFrom what I learned (and tried but failed on a test install of Monterey), due to (security) changes made in Catalina or so, nowadays it is not as easy as it was. I did some research but did not find a reliable explanation how to set symlinks (resp. firmlinks I stumbled across) on Monterey.\nCan I substitute a folder on the NAS for a local folder in the user's home folder on macOS Monterey?\n\nA: I use Resilio Sync to sync my Documents folder between my Mac Mini and MacBook Pro.\nI also have a Synology NAS, and there is a Resilio Sync app for it.\nHowever, there are other loads of other syncing apps out there.\nI think syncing between the three things (whether by Resilio, or rsync, or Chronosync, etc) is probably safer than trying to modify the Documents (et al) folders and making the network drive a 'host' -- particularly if you want to take the MacBook for a walk.\n(Technically, Desktop, Documents and Downloads are User folders, not System folders.)\n\nA: I personally wouldn't mess with the home folder. A couple apps allow you to locate their \"storage\" outside the home folder like Photos and Music - so I would move my entire home folder to the external drive / NAS if you can't live with just a couple items outside the local /Users folder which on macOS Monterey (and newer) is at /System/Volumes/Data/Users\nTrying other things is more hassle, more debugging, more points of failure than any benefit I've seen or experienced. A few people have pulled it off, but they all had very detailed and long experience in why / how / managing things on both the UNIX and macOS end to succeed.\n\nA: My solution:\nAfter having made a trade-off between \"heavy\" tinkering (much more as it was needed under Mojave) to point only some User folders to my NAS versus treating them as \"Favorites\", I skipped the Symlink part and made them accessible in the Finder like back in the Mojave days: I colored the synced Documents and Download User folders and added them to the Finder sidebar on the iMac (\"* Drive\" and color is indicating the remote ones). Same on the MacBook. 2 Macs, identical data.\nI can quickly choose them in the \"Save\" dialogues (see screenshot, Safari example), drag stuff around in the Finder and it's still pretty close to the setup I had in the past.

And tagged the files with the processing they received.\n\n*As such I kept all intermediary stages in folders. And each file grew by a tag per each processing stage to document what was done on it specifically (they got different treatment).\n\n*Should I mess up along the way, I could always go back phase by phase due to my incremental folder backups.\n\n*Thank to APFS being a copy-on-write system that folder duplication worked ultra fast.\n\n*But along the duplications and tagging something must have went wrong.

No luck either. Found no anomalies whatsoever.\n\n*Relaunching Finder or restarting the Mac didn't help either.\n\nWhat can be the reason for this odd behavior?\n\nA: \nReason: The Creation Date of those files was broken/invalid\nAfter much investigation I had finally found the reason\n\n*\n\n*All the files that showed these strange symptoms had two things in common:\n\n*A common Finder tag which I assigned them in a massive batch assignment (500 files or more at once).\n\n*They all had a Creation Date of 1984-02-24 (aka January 24th, 1984) the birth date of the Macintosh.\n\n*\n\n*This is the fallback date if the creation date is 0 or NULL or otherwise invalid I assume.\n\n*So during the batch assignment of tags something broke and left the file dates in a bad result.\n\n\n\nHow to fix these broken files\n\n*\n\n*If the creation dates don't matter to you, just set them to the same as the modification date.\n\n*\n\n*By your tool of choice, e.g.:\n\n*\n\n*A Better Finder Attributes\n\n*SetFile -d \"$(GetFileInfo -m \"broken-file.ext\")\" broken-file.ext\n\n\n\n*Or by a gratis and builtin function of Finder:\n\n*\n\n*You can simply zip the file(s)s them with Finder's integrated ZIP command.\n\n*Right-click file(s) > Compress.\n\n*All macOS metadata is preserved (Finder Tags, Spotlight Comment, dates, permissions, etc).\n\n*And when unzipping the file plus all metadata is restored and the broken/invalid creation dates are fixed automatically.\n\n\n\n\n\n*In my case preserving the creation dates mattered to understand the image file genesis.\n\n*\n\n*But due to having worked with incremental backups, I could restore them from one of the intermediary folder. And just tag them again.\n\n*And this time I left the Finder window in front, until all tags updated (can take some 20-60 seconds when tagging hundreds/thousands of files) not to mess it up again. I guess having done some else other file management wise in Finder prematurely caused the mess up in the first place.\n\n\n\n", "Q: What program is reading my CD/DVD/Blu-Ray drive in my external drive? I have two external USB optical drives, both burners, one that will work with DVDs and CDs, the other that will also handle BDs (Blu-ray Discs). I use these sometimes with MakeMKV. Recently I had an issue with reading a BD with MakeMKV and had to force-quit MakeMKV. I tried to eject the BD, but Disk Utilities would not because it was in use. (I remember at one point I found a way to still eject it, but I was unable to use that drive to read anything until I rebooted because the OS still saw it as in use.) I rebooted.\nOn reboot the OS recognized the BD in the drive and it came up in Finder. But I still heard a fair amount of activity from the drive. It's no longer making noise, but the access LED on the drive is still flashing. I've had this happen before, where I have discs in either drive, usually DVDs or BDs, and I hear movement in the drive even when I haven't been using any software to access that drive for hours or even a day or more.\nSo it seems that something is accessing my external USB optical drives even when I'm not using any software to do this.\nHow can I find out what program is trying to access discs in my optical drive?\n\nA: If you're comfortable with the command line, you can open a Terminal window and use a command like:\nlsof +D /Volumes/<volumename>\n\n‘lsof’ stands for ‘list open files’, and lists information on files opened by processes.\nIt can take a very long time to run (as it has to list all files on the given volume and then search for processes using any of them).\nIt includes only files your user has permission for, so you may want to prefix it with sudo , to run it as root.\nBy default it lists the command name, process ID, username, file descriptor number, device numbers, file size, node number, and filename — but there are options to show other info. (Type man lsof to see info on all the various options.) The command name is probably the most useful item here; though if that's not enough, you can note down the process ID and look that up in ps or the Activity Monitor app.\n(You don't need to search an entire volume, as that command will work with any file or directory; the fewer files it has to search for, the faster it'll run.)\n", "Q: Can installing Monterey damage the bios on the logic-board and the ssd I have a MacBook Pro (15\", Mid 2015; 2.2GHz Quad-Core Intel Core i7; 16GB 1600 MHz DDR3).\nRecently it started to go slowly and erratically;  eventually flashing onto the screen, momentarily, 'serious error'.\nIt became unusable so I took it to a local Mac specialist who says \"... updating the OS to Monterey (actually done several months previously with no obvious bad effect!) damaged the bios on the logic-board and the ssd also...\".  This specialist says the ssd needs replacing and the the bios repairing.\nMy questions -\nCould updating to Monterey cause the problem described?  I'm surprised that there was no warning not to proceed if the the update was this dangerous.\nDoes the solution - new ssd and repairing bios - make sense?\n\nA: First thing. Find another tech if that one insists on bios being part of the hardware. Perhaps they or you are using terminology that's familiar assuming PC knowledge transfers to Apple hardware and that's OK for starters, but ask for clarification and documentation on Apple's site on what process they followed to diagnose it to be sure they and you agree on the actual issue.\nAll computers have some sort of firmware, but bios isn’t on yours.\nSecond, the repairs might be needed since that’s the nature of things when they break. They are fine and fine and then suddenly (to us at least) they break. (Everything about high speed digital circuits and processing is sudden, though. Even things that work happen suddenly since they do millions of operations a second.)\nWhat you can do is an erase install from the internet recovery after backing up anything and everything you care to save.\nSometimes an install goes bad in the download or the install or the post install migration. If your second try at a clean install of everything ( software, firmware updates, setup) fails you’ll know you need a repair.\n", "Q: Which Type C to USB adapters work with Macbook Pro? I have been given a Macbook Pro A2442 which for some horribly deranged reason, has been manufactured without standard USB 2 or USB 3 ports.\nSince the official Apple Type C to USB adapter is pointlessly expensive (and has an ugly design), I'm looking for a more reasonable alternative.

I read that in certain cases that it blocks this environment variable, but it is not entirely clear to me when it does and doesn't apply.\nThe Python3 interpreter in question is located in a \"virtual environment\" which means that it is actually running out of a user-local directory which therefore would not be covered by SIP.  But the libraries themselves do reside in /usr, which is. I did rebuild that virtual environment.\n\nA: It appears that System Integrity Protection (SIP) was the root cause of the problem.

I use a VS Code open \"Preferences\" via ~/Library/Application Support/Microsoft Edge/Default/ when doing nslookup, this file has never been changed, it won't reload to new.\n\n*I use the same installer (use Firefox download from Microsoft) to install Edge on another computer, it creates the same problem, and I know I never visit the Adware address on that machine before.\n\n*Why I define it as a hijack: when I enter a different address that didn't exist, it still points to 45.11.104.33 or 45.11.104.104.\n\n\n\n\n*I tried to use Dev Tools on Edge, and I noticed that when I enter an address, Edge responded \"Not found\" correctly. Then there's a 301 rewrite that happened. It says \"301 Moved Permanently (from disk cache)\" at the moment. Then the address redirects to 45.11.104.33 or 45.11.104.104.\n\n\n\n\n*All invalid domain has been rewritten to 45.11.104.33 or 45.11.104.104, then point to ermin-oxj.info then the tripledeliveryinstance.com loads the Adware website.\n\n*I have VM on the same Mac, it is Windows 11 VM using Parallels Desktop. When I tried to do nslookup on it, it responded correctly.\n\n\nWhat happened to my Mac Edge?\n\nA: your question is a problem with the Mac computer search domain.：\nnetworksetup -listallnetworkservices\n\nThen delete all search domains. The main culprit is the HOST search domain, which will be added to your empty domain name as a suffix, so that it can be resolved to the DNS server specified by the hacker, and then it will be jumped many times.\nnetworksetup -setsearchdomains <yournetworkservice> Empty\n\nIf there is still a search domain that cannot be deleted by default, then change your LAN IP address and the search domain will be emptied. At this time, all the problems will be solved!\n\nA: Finally, I found out it maybe a TP-LINK router settings problem.\nA TP-LINK router while make settings for the first time, it needs you type \"https://tplogin.cn\" to the browser. It is not a DNS address, but a search domain address depends on DHCP/HOST search domain.\nWhen I disable DHCP/HOST search domain, I cannot login the router by typing that address, but I still can use IP address login.\nWhen I use default DHCP/HOST search domain, Microsoft Edge DNS hijack happened, so maybe the TP-LINK DHCP/HOST has been hijacked.\nWhen I use static IP, Microsoft Edge DNS become safe.\nI reset the router but no help, it is a default settings by TP-LINK, maybe I should replace my TP-LINK router.\n", "Q: Limitations to file path and filename lengths in macOS and/or iOS / iPadOS?

You need to remove/change the number in everything from iMessage to WhatsApp, and also any service you use which has your phone number as a 2FA/backup/lost password path.\nThe time from abandoning an old number to it being re-assigned to a new user is provider-dependant, from 90 days to a year.\n\nA: When you de-activate your phone number it should de-activate from iMessage.

And secondly off the boot drive onto a slower drive of the following:\n/Applications\n/Library \n/Users\n\nI thought of splitting up /Applications into Mac/System one and downloaded applications.\nIs it sensible to move the /Users directory onto the external drive in order to separate it from system files and folders?\nAnd finally, is rsync or ditto any better for moving?\n\nA: You should never mess with system folders like /Applications or /Users unless you are already a macOS expert and even then prepared for an unusable system!\nBut you can move the home folders of individual users to another disk. You should not try to do this manually or with utilities like rsync.\nBefore you start anything like this make sure 1) you have good backup and 2) an alternative administrator user. Both to assist in recovering when something goes wrong.\nOpen System Settings, choose Users & Groups. Right click on a user and select 'Advanced Options...'\nOn Ventura this displays:\n\nSelect \"Choose...\" below Home Directory and then a location on another disk. Allow macOS to move the home folder.\nIn your question you refer to using a non-SSD drive. I strongly recommend that you keep all user home directories on an SSD.

(But not stuff from the App Store like Pages, etc.)\nWhile apps that you install can be quite large, I guarantee you that most of the space on your disk is taken up by your documents. Photos, videos, audio, PDFs, and other document files.\nApple makes it easy to move the Photos.app library; and the Music.app library (both in those apps' preferences). If you use Logic Pro, there are settings there to move the sample library to a new location. (Don't know about Garageband.)\nThere's no reason why documents need to be under your user account.

There should be a drive shown there with the label \"Fusion Drive\".\n(I believe for Ventura or later, you go to  > System Settings > General > Storage instead.)\nSee the accepted answer for the solution. This is a complete reinstall of the os, so do backups first. TimeMachine and an external drive make this seamless (but it still takes like half a day.)\n\nA: Fusion drives consist of two physical volumes that are combined into one logical volume group. That doesn't appear to be the case here:\n/dev/disk2 (synthesized):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      APFS Container Scheme -                      +999.9 GB   disk2\n                                 Physical Store disk1s2\n\nThis says that your logical boot volume spans a single physical medium, disk1s2, which, from the earlier diskutil output, appears to be your 1 TB HDD. If the logical volume also spanned your 32 GB SSD (disk0), the last line would instead read Physical Stores disk0s2, disk1s2.\nYou can also use the diskutil apfs list command to see a hierarchical representation of your logical and physical volumes. It might make the picture more clear.\nIf you did not manually recreate the Fusion configuration using the diskutil resetFusion command or the appropriate series of low-level diskutil apfs XXXX commands, then it's not surprising to be running purely off the HDD and leaving the SSD unused. And that would certainly negatively affect your performance.\nYou may want to back up all of your data, erase your drive, boot into Recovery, and use the diskutil resetFusion command to start over, verifying your configuration with diskutil apfs list before reinstalling macOS and restoring your data.\n", "Q: In Finder windows, thumbnails for PDF files do not show/render. This is true only for PDF files. How to fix? I run an old dinosaur; a late 2013 15\" MacBook Pro (i7, quad core, 16GB RAM--soon to be retired) with Big Sur (11.7.7).  Big Sur is unfortunately the most \"recent\" operating system supported by Apple for hardware this old. I'm upgrading in February.\nAs the subject indicates, the issue has to do with PDF files now showing their respective thumbnails, but only in Finder windows.  Of note, earlier today, this was also true for PDF files on the Desktop (when looking at the Desktop itself). I was able to get these to reappear by following these instructions for killing com.apple.quicklook.ThumbnailsAgent within the Activity Monitor, then force-quitting (restarting) Finder.  That process restored the thumbnails on the Desktop, but not PDF files viewed within Finder windows.\nFinder does however render thumbnails for all other file types without issue.  Only PDF's are affected.\nAny suggestions for how to fix this annoyance would be most welcomed.\n..and thank you in advance!\nUpdate 202211211230: result of qlmanage -m | grep pdf as follows:\n\n\nA: You have determined that is not a user-related problem (by testing another user account). In that case, it must be at the system level. You have also reinstalled the OS.\nI would have a look to see what third-party software you have installed that might be causing problems. Anything that 'alters' the OS with additional functionality; any Finder extensions; or things like that.\n", "Q: Photos sync with iCloud when library too big? I've recently upgraded from Yosemite to Catalina and therefore was forced to switch from iPhoto to Photos.  One thing I was hoping to take advantage of in Photos is the ability to sync with iCloud.  However my old iPhoto library that has now been brought into Photos is too big to fit in my iCloud account.  I pay for the 200Gb iCloud storage but my library is 500Gb and I don't want to upgrade to the 2Tb version to fit files that I don't need stored in iCloud.  Instead, I want to just tell Photos/iCloud to only sync photos that are newer than, say, 2019.  Or only sync the most recent 50Gb.  But the only way I've been able to figure out how to do that is to manually split out my Photos Library into a sort of archive library and a sync'ed \"System Library\" and continually manage that split by moving photos from one to the other (which I'm not even sure of the best way to do).\nI've done extensive Googling on library management and haven't found any good guides for how to manage large libraries in conjunction with iCloud.  There was one question here on Ask Different from 7 years ago that was very similar but didn't have an answer other than manage separately libraries and I'm hoping there is better/newer information out there.\nSo does anyone have a trick about how to manage what iCloud syncs?  Failing that, are there better suggestions for how to manage a large Photos library to make it so some of it can sync and some of it doesn't?  And I need to manage two Photos libraries with one for not-syncing and one for syncing, what's the best way to move photos between the two Photos libraries?\n\nA: You cannot selectively sync within a photo library.\nIf you want to remain on your current 200GB tier, you will have to find a method of archival to remove photos from your library.\nOne approach could be to use a new photo library for every year. At the end of the year, ensure it's fully downloaded and disconnect it from iCloud. Reset your iCloud photos and make a new library.\nHowever, for reasons that should be apparent, this won't be a seamless process. I'm not aware of any seamless process that allows what you're looking for.\n", "Q: Write plist defaults value inside a named profile How do I write a value inside a named profile, like so;\ndefaults write com.apple.Terminal \"'Window Settings'.Basic.shellExitAction\" -int 1\n\nObviously this doesn't work and also tried multiple variants, like writing in array/object style with [name][sub_name], but none seems to work and I can't find the logic in the documentation.\n\nA: I used PlistBuddy instead;\nreadonly plist_file=\"${HOME}/Library/Preferences/com.apple.Terminal.plist\"\n\n/usr/libexec/PlistBuddy \"${plist_file}\" -c \"delete :'Window Settings':Basic:shellExitAction\"\n\n/usr/libexec/PlistBuddy \"${plist_file}\" -c \"add :'Window Settings':Basic:shellExitAction integer 1\"\n\n", "Q: Allow in the Background Unrecognized Entry I have a mysterious entry called \"Denis Graur\", does anybody have clue of what it is from?

It seems this may be the same situation affecting your installation of CactusVPN, and that a developer update might be needed. Something changed in Ventura no doubt.\nAn example I saw yesterday was in an update to Backup Loupe (to v3.8.1). The text:\nmacOS Ventura: Application and helper tools do not appear as BackupLoupe in the Login Items section of General tab of System Settings\n\nI've two more like that on my system, but luckily I recognise the developer's name.\nhttps://soma-zone.com/BackupLoupe/ReleaseNotes.html\n", "Q: Encrypted file image access I have 3 users on a mac os computer:\n\n*\n\n*Administrator\n\n*user A: Standard Account\n\n*user B: Standard Account\n\nUser A should not see User B files.

No matter what I've tried the dates are not preserved. Helpful advice would be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: Use ditto instead of cp. ditto copies hierarchies by default (so no need for -r) so ditto src_folder /Volumes/external_drive most likely will be enough (but check the man page for details).\nPS: Ability to preserve attributes depends on the format of the target device (so if you copy to a FAT-formatted drive some attributes will be lost).\n", "Q: How to merge enumerated.pdf files in order by filename?

The goal is to have only the .pdf file merged in order:\n0100_bear.pdf, \n0201_cat.pdf \n1001_falcon.pdf\n\nIf there is an simpler method to achieve the goal (preferably using a native MacOS command instead of pdftk), I look forward to your reply\nBonus round: a one-liner to merge in reverse order:\n1001_falcon.pdf\n0201_cat.pdf \n0100_bear.pdf, \n\n\nA: For simple concatenation of PDF files, the utility pdfunite is about as simple as it gets. It is one of the utilities that come with the Poppler PDF rendering library and can be installed with brew install poppler. It is also included in the poppler-utils package in Debian and Ubuntu and the poppler package in ArchLinux and Fedora if you're using Linux.\nThe usage is\npdfunite file1.pdf file2.pdf file3.pdf mergedfile.pdf\n\nTo process all files with the extension \"pdf\" in the current directory in the order of string numerical value if there are no whitespaces in any of the files:\npdfunite $(\\ls -v *.pdf) output.pdf\n\nAnd if there are possibly whitespaces in the filenames, it gets a little more complicated, but this should work:\n(\\ls -v *.pdf; echo output.pdf) | tr \\\\n \\\\0 | xargs -0 pdfunite\n\nExplanation:\n\n*\n\n*\\ls invokes the ls from your $PATH ignoring any aliases. This may be important in case you have an aliased ls that shows extra information (like special characters to denote certain permissions). You can also just use an absolute path to the ls executable, like /usr/bin/ls.\n\n*ls -v sorts the files according to (version) numbers within text\n\n*tr \\\\n \\\\0 replaces newlines with NULLs after each file\n\n*xargs -0 tells xargs to use the NULL character to separate arguments\n\nAs you can see, proper handling of things like whitespace (and other special characters) when piping commands in the shell can get a little complicated.

Company exists for 10 years, but they just started to have an IT department now for 4-5 months. All devices (Macs) that have been given out in the last 10 years, are all unmanaged, and set-up as personal. No MDM, no rules, nothing.\nNow it's my task to audit and index everything we have.\nI wonder if there is an easier way to retrieve someone's serial number, and the model name (example: MacBook Pro, 16-inch, 2021, and if possible, more info like RAM and storage, but this is more than enough) of the device that they are using, other than to manually open the about and more info...\nI was thinking of using Automator or something, but I couldn't find any info on that online, unfortunately.\nHopefully someone can help, or guide me toward the best direction, because I don't want to manually reach out to all the people...\nCheers!\n\nA: There are many ways to automate this. One way is to use the system_profiler command to retrieve the specific data that you're interested in. This is the command-line equivalent of the System Information tool that runs when you do About This Mac -> More Info.\nSince there's lot of available system information available about each Mac, the data is grouped into categories. To list these categories, run\nsystem_profiler -listDataTypes | sort\n\nThen you can specify the names of one or more categories to the system_profiler command to retrieve the information associated with that category.\nFor example, the system's model name and serial number are found in the SPHardwareDataType category, and the system's DRAM configuration is in the SPMemoryDataType category. So if I wanted to quickly collect data from both categories, I could run\nsystem_profiler SPHardwareDataType SPMemoryDataType\n\nExample output:\nHardware:\n\n    Hardware Overview:\n\n      Model Name: Mac Classic\n      Model Identifier: MacClassic1,1\n      Processor Name: Motorola MC68000\n      Processor Speed: 8.0 MHz\n      Number of Processors: 1\n      Total Number of Cores: 1\n      L2 Cache (per Core): 0 KB\n      L3 Cache: 0 MB\n      Hyper-Threading Technology: Disabled\n      Memory: 4 MB\n      Boot ROM Version: 123.14.5.0.0\n      Serial Number (system): CA5B061498D94\n      Hardware UUID: 19CB09DD-79D3-4B26-922F-B365549A6B22\n      Activation Lock Status: Disabled\n\nMemory:\n\n    Memory Slots:\n\n      ECC: Disabled\n      Upgradeable Memory: Yes\n\n        BANK 0/ChannelA-SIMM0:\n\n          Size: 2 MB\n          Type: SDR\n          Speed: 6.67 MHz\n          Status: OK\n          Manufacturer: Micron\n          Part Number: -\n          Serial Number: -\n\n        BANK 0/ChannelA-SIMM1:\n\n          Size: 2 MB\n          Type: SDR\n          Speed: 6.67 MHz\n          Status: OK\n          Manufacturer: Micron\n          Part Number: -\n          Serial Number: -\n\nDepending on your needs, you can then apply all sorts of text postprocessing to the above output (e.g., grep).

Will running 2 VMs in Parallels reduce lifespan of 1Tb SSD to some noticeable margin? Is it justified to install VMs on external SSD or it is an overkill?\n\nA: No, there's nothing specific about virtual machines in general that would reduce the lifespan of your SSD.\nI.e. if you run the same program inside a virtual machine or outside a virtual machine, it generates about the same disk activity - and thus wears down the lifespan of your SSD just the same.\nThe only thing I can think of regarding virtual machines and SSD life span is to ensure that you haven't got some sort of \"home made\" backup system in place that copies around changed files on your SSD. If you use image backed virtual machines this could mean that an entire VM image is being copied when only a small portion of it has changed. A good backup system wouldn't do that - and even less good ones wouldn't do this as they would be storing the changed files on external media (i.e. in the cloud, on an external USB drive or similar) - and wouldn't be copying around the data on your local SSD.\nAll in all, there's absolutely nothing to worry about regarding SSD lifespan when using virtual machines for normal home, business or developer users.\n", "Q: macOS: Keep individual files or folders available offline within an iCloud folder? On my Macbook, I have a folder that is synced to iCloud. It looks like this:\n\nThis is great, because in case something happens to my MacBook, I have a backup. However, my iCloud has more data than my MacBook's harddrive can hold, so iCloud routinely deletes the local copy of my files to free up space, while keeping them safe in the cloud. This is bad because files I need may not be available locally on my laptop, and when a Desktop application needs the file, it can't access the file, and it appears to the application as if the file is no longer there.\nIf I want to keep the file available locally, I have to manually find the missing file in Finder and click \"Download Now\" in the context menu:\n\nThis workaround does help, but only temporarily - after some hours, macOS decides to \"optimize\" my storage again and delete the local copy, reverting it back to the previous state, and breaking my desktop application. Super annoying.\nIs it possible to mark a folder and/or files to permanently remain locally downloaded?\nSome Googling reveals it is possible to do this on iCloud on Windows (huh?!) and iPad, but I can't find instructions on how to do it on a Mac (double huh?!)\n\nA: Sadly, it seems that macOS simply does not have the feature that would solve this exact problem directly - only Windows has the feature.\nTherefore, the best way to mitigate this problem is to simply switch from iCloud to something like DropBox or Google Drive, which as others have pointed out, is a better solution anyway since they have version history etc.\n", "Q: Can someone who has tried to run Xcode 14.1 on a 2014 mac mini verify that they were they able to successfully develop an app using this setup My brother wants to develop an iPhone app.  I have over 25 years of programming experience, but not for the iOS/Apple ecosystem.  In any case I decided to help him out, but I don't personally own any mac hardware.\nI am trying to find the cheapest path to be able to develop an iPhone app.   Doing a little research reveals...\n\n*\n\n*\"starting April 2023, all iOS and iPadOS apps submitted to the App Store must be built with Xcode 14.1 and the iOS 16.1 SDK.\" [1]\n\n\n*Xcode only (legally) runs on mac hardware (so I need to get hardware somehow).\n\n\n*Xcode 14.1 requires macOS Monterey 12.5 or newer [2]\n\n\n*The oldest/cheapest mac that will run macOs Monterey is the Mac Mini from late 2014 [3]\n\n\n*These would be part numbers MGEM2xx/A, MGEN2xx/A, MGEQ2xx/A [4]\n\n\n*These model numbers are currently selling for like $100~$300 refurbished on eBay.\nI think (on paper at least) that I have verified that I can run Xcode 14.1 on a 2014 mac mini.\nSo here is the main question.\nCan someone who has tried to run Xcode 14.1 on a 2014 mac mini verify that they were they able to successfully develop an app using this configuration.\nFor context, let's assume I want to run the iOS simulator for test and debug.  I will use swift as the programming language.\nAlso assume that the app I am developing is not very resource intensive (no 3D or 2D animations or physics).  It will be a simple adventure story type game.  The user is first shown a static background image (JPEG), some text, and a menu.  The menu choice gets them to a new state, with a new image, text and menu options.  That continues until they reach the end of the story.\n\nA: The 2014 Mini comes with a range of different CPUs: from 1.4GHz i5 to a 3Ghz i7. However, all of them have only 2 cores. So they are quite weak (and 8 years' old). They certainly would not be 'unusable'; but they are at least 'not well suited' to development work. RAM will also be a factor.\nAlso, they don't have USB-C or TB3. Monterey is that last OS that they can run, so you're already 1 year behind current; if Apple changes the requirements in the future, you've got no way of meeting them.\nIt might be the cheapest way into the Apple eco-system, but not the most cost-effective, and you'd probably have to buy something else in a year or two. 'Buy cheap, pay twice', as my grandmother said.\nI would suggest trying to find a secondhand 2018 Mini instead, which comes in 4-core i3 and 6-core i5 and i7 models. Apple still sells this model, but (secondhand) prices of the Intel models have fallen, as demand for the new Apple Silicon CPUs increases.\nThe 2018 Mini is a solid performer, which should last you a long time. I have the i5, and I use it for small Xcode projects with no problem.\nAlternatively, it is thought that Apple will release an \"M2\" Mini early next year; at which point there may be a rush of secondhand M1 Minis onto the market. That would be your best option, if you can wait a bit (and maybe save a bit more cash).\n", "Q: Fusion drive on iMac model 17,1, Mojave 10.14 - APFS or HFS+ format for HDD? I have read that APFS was optimized for SSDs, but that it's not an optimal choice[ for HDDs. However, I just got my iMac (Model 17,1; OS X Mojave, 10.14) back from repair, and both drives are formatted as APFS. I checked a diskutil output made before the repair work was done (i.e. as it came from the factory), and it seems that both drives were APFS when my iMac was originally built.\nIs the APFS format on the HDD in a Fusion Drive a necessity (perhaps due the the need for the SSD using APFS)?

On High Sierra and earlier, logical volume groups use the Core Storage layer and HFS+ volumes. (Source: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207584)\nIt's true that the design of HFS+ optimizes for rotational storage and APFS optimizes for solid-state storage, so you can expect to take somewhat of a performance hit on your HDD. However, the whole point of Fusion is to allow macOS to dynamically migrate your most heavily used files (e.g., common system libraries, caches, and frequently accessed documents) onto the SSD, where they will experience an order of magnitude faster access times than they would on the HDD, APFS or not. So overall it's still a net win even if your HDD isn't formatted HFS+.\n(If you were hell-bent on squeezing every last millisecond of performance out of your system AND you had a very specific use case, you could un-merge your Fusion drive and format the SSD as APFS and the HDD as HFS+ and use them as separate drives, but I can't imagine a real-world workflow where a manual access strategy could consistently outperform the Fusion hotfile algorithm. It'd be way more of a hassle in any case.)\n", "Q: What is this Login Item - Allow in the Background?

Namely the UNAUTHENTICATED_ROOT looks dangerous.\n\nA: UNAUTHENTICATED_ROOT just disables SSV (Signed System Volume). SSV makes it so that if any modifications are made to the Root Volume, then it won't be bootable anymore.\nNormally, this would be a good security measure against some attacks, but it's also a hindrance for if you're patching with OCLP. If you're using Root Volume Patches, and you enable SSV, you may render your root volume unbootable and need to reinstall macOS using recovery or a bootable installer.\nUNRESTRICTED_FS disables filesystem restrictions. I'm pretty sure this allows you to modify directories that are usually protected, even from root access.\nUNTRUSTED_KEXTS allows you to install untrusted kexts to /System/Library/Extensions. In the case of OCLP, this allows you to install graphics driver patches to modern OS versions.\nIf your SIP settings are set to 0x803, you WILL want to leave it as-is.

I have 3 USB disks all doing Time Machine backups.\nMacOS does them in series. Disk1, then Disk2, then Disk3, then back to 1 and so.\nSometimes it takes 4 hours to return to Disk1. Is there a way to make Disk1 the preferred disk or to make the cycle go faster?\n\nA: This is an answer in two parts. Firstly to the explicit question about Time Machine (TM), and secondly some suggestions to a backup paranoid.\nA gentle paranoia about backup is good thing so long as it addresses all data risks and mitigates them.\nNo, there is no way to make one TM disk have priority. TM is designed to have minimal configuration yet meet the needs to most users. It does not offer the kind of tweaks that many of us crave.  That is the answer done.\nHere are some comments on @Duck's current strategy and suggestions (opinions) for changes based on my experience.\nWhilst @Duck is using 3 permanently connected disks to mitigate the risk of failure of a single backup disk, it does not address other risks like failure of TM software or major disasters like fire or theft. Also TM is designed to be as efficient as possible with repeated backups to one disk - it is less efficient with overlapping 3 hours cycles.\nSuggestions:\n\n*\n\n*Continue to use Time Machine backing up to just one disk. Use an alternative product for backup to another disk on a 1 or 2 hour schedule. I would choose Carbon Copy Cloner (CCC) as the alternative. Both TM and CCC provide reasonably fast recovery following minor (but quite likely) local hardware disasters.  I would use the third disk for something else.\n\n\n*Develop a strategy for off-site backup to mitigate the risks of fire, theft and other more life-catastrophic disasters. Off-site backup is also a mitigation strategy for ransomeware and other malware which corrupts local storage.\n\n\n*Off-site backup could be using the the third disk, but keeping it at a friend's home, workplace or bank vault.  But keeping to a strict schedule of taking and storing these backups is not easy.\n\n\n*Instead, backup into the \"cloud\" using another backup product. I use the backup product Arq Backup with cloud storage from OneDrive (\"free\" with my Microsoft/Office 365 subscription) and Backblaze B2. Recovery from the cloud will not be fast, but after personally catastrophic disasters this is not critical.\nDevelop your own risk based strategy for backup.

The requirement in a no-budget project is as follows: an existing iMac, which is used by one developer for most of the time, has to be used by a second developer from time to time; so both developers need their own admin accounts (with full root permissions). But since none of the admins should be able to read the other's data, creating two admin accounts isn't a solution.\nTherefore I consider to split the drive into 2 partitions and installing macOS into each of them, then creating one admin account per macOS partition and securing them by separate FileVaults (I know that each admin could delete the whole partition of the other, but that's not a problem in this context).\nThese questions occur:\n\n*\n\n*Which filesystem/format should I use for the two partitions?\n\n*The iMac has a 1TB Fusion Drive: what do I have to take into consideration?\n\n*Since both systems will have the same software installed: is it possible to create a 3rd partition that holds the application folder for both macOS systems?\n\nLooking forward for answers.\n\nA: My take on your questions (and one other):\n\n*\n\n*Which filesystem/format should I use for the two partitions?\n\nAssuming a recent version of macOS, use APFS. You don't have any choice.\n\n\n*The iMac has a 1TB Fusion Drive: what do I have to take into consideration?\n\nOuch! One partition will combine the SSD with part of the HDD, the other will be HDD only. So one of the developers will have a slow HDD only system.\nThis really makes the two partition model a bad way of separating your two developers.\n\n\n*Since both systems will have the same software installed: is it possible to create a 3rd partition that holds the application folder for both macOS systems?\n\nYou can't move the whole /Applications to a third partition. Some applications could be installed to a third partition. Some applications must be in /Applications. And Apple are making what you propose more difficult by relocating applications not in /Applications.\nI would have a third partition for shared things, but not to partially replace /Applications or other system folders.\n\n\n*Are there any alternatives? Yes, but they destroy your zero-budget project.\n\n4A. Each developer (or maybe just the 'other' developer) could have their own external SSD and boot from that.\n4B.

It was a great system until its Fusion Drive failed. After two unsuccessful attempts to repair the Fusion Drive, I am now concerned whether or not this iMac is reparable: Apple declined to repair a \"vintage\" iMac, and the \"repair\" performed by a specialist Mac repair shop was an expensive failure.\nThe repairability issue seems to be largely due to Apple's proprietary SSD designs. For some models, one can find 3rd party replacement SSDs, but for other models, compatible repair parts are not available from any source. For example, OWC - the primary 3rd party source for replacement SSDs for Apple products - does not make an SSD compatible with my iMac Model 17,1.\nSome have suggested that a simpler solution to repair a Fusion Drive is simply to replace it with a single, non-Fusion SSD connected to the iMac's internal SATA cabling. This strikes me as an ideal solution - assuming there are no awkward tradeoffs. This question(s) is intended to discover what - if any - tradeoffs are required for the non-Fusion repair option. It's highly likely I do not know what these tradeoffs might be, so I'll list the ones I can think of & ask those providing answers to list any others they're aware of.\nPotential tradeoffs & questions for a non-Fusion repair option:\n\n*\n\n*Performance: I'm not very concerned about reductions in classic storage drive performance. SATA3 is never going to equal PCI data rates, but the performance limitations I want to overcome are those that require 60 seconds for a login, and 30 second delays in launching an app!\n\n\n*Question 1: Will the non-Fusion repair option eliminate the horribly sluggish performance I see now?\n\n\n*Question 2: My Time Machine backup was done on the system when it had a Fusion Drive. Will this backup restore to the non-Fusion system?\n\n\n*Question 3: Should the SSD portion of the Fusion Drive be removed from the system, should it remain - or does it make any difference?\n\n\n*Question 4: Do you know of any other likely tradeoffs or artifacts wrt a non-Fusion system?\n\nA: Much of this is opinion rather than fact (others may do better):\nQ1: Depends on the cause of the sluggish performance. My guess is that the cause is not (or not just) the Fusion drive.\nQ2: Yes, the backup will restore.\nQ3: Opinion: It should not make any difference. But since you have an unknown cause of poor performance, I would get it removed.\nQ4: A non-Fusion system will perform more consistently. It has less components to go wrong.\nDo note that replacing the HDD with a SATA SSD does require the right temperature sensor.\nRegarding OWC, I believe they can supply replacement SSDs.  In Australia, I go here https://www.macfixit.com.au/collections/ssd-imac-27-inch-2013-2019. There are SSDs and installation kits.\nEdit: read the fine print (as you have done), \"Aura Pro X2 is not compatible with iMac17,1 (Late 2015)\".  But the SSD for HDD should be fine.\n", "Q: Unknown locale, assuming C - Error message in terminal Note: The question is not about how to change the locale, or what is the locale. The question is about why is there a locale-based error in man in 10.3, but no error in 12.6, even though the locales are identical in both cases.\n\nAfter running man, reading a manual entry and closing it, I receive the following error\n$ man curl                     # The manual opens, I read it, then close\nUnknown locale, assuming C\n$ man zsh                      # The manual opens, I read it, then close\nUnknown locale, assuming C\n\nThe manual pages work correctly, and can be browsed, but I have no idea where the error comes from, and it is rather annoying.\nThis is what I obtain when running locale\n$ locale\nLANG=\"\"\nLC_COLLATE=\"C\"\nLC_CTYPE=\"UTF-8\"\nLC_MESSAGES=\"C\"\nLC_MONETARY=\"C\"\nLC_NUMERIC=\"C\"\nLC_TIME=\"C\"\nLC_ALL=\n\nI'm using Ventura 13.0. The same error does not happen in 12.6 even though the locale is identical (see below), so I do not think that it is an issue with locale, but rather an issue with man.\nNote that locale says\n   LANG         Used as a substitute for any unset LC_* variable.   \\  \nIf LANG is unset, it will act as if set to \"C\".  If any of LANG or  \\  \nLC_* are set to invalid values, locale acts as if they are all unset.\n\nso there should be no error, LANG should be automatically set to C.\nEDIT:\nSome new insight. I ran the same commands on two computers.\nComputer 1 runs 13.0 outputs the error.\nThis computer has man for MacOS 13.0 from January 9 2021.\nComputer 2 runs 12.6 and outputs no error.\nThis computer has man version 1.6g from September 19 2005.\nThe output of the locale command is completely identical on both computers, in particular they both have LC_CTYPE=\"UTF-8\".\nCould it be a man bug?\n\nA: Terminal\nSelect menu Terminal > Settings....\nIn the window goto Profiles and the tab Advanced.\nAt the bottom deselect the option:\nSet locale environment variables on startup\nDo this for all the profiles you use.\niTerm2\nSelect menu iTerm2 > Settings....\nIn the window goto Profiles and the tab Terminal.\nAt the bottom deselect the option:\nSet locale variables automatically\nDo this for all the profiles you use.\nStill odd that this should be the fix.\nAccording to the Tooltip in iTerm:\n\nLANG and LC_CTYPE may be set if this is enabled. If you have an unusual setting of country and language then disabling this may help.\n\nSo, the root-cause must be the locale settings that got screwed over during the upgrade to 13.0.*. I'm guessing the best fix is to set LANG and LC_CTYPE to something more useful (UTF-8 perhaps, as suggested elsewhere).\n\nA: I have this issue too and I did some digging. macOS ventura is delivered in this state, it is not due to homebrew or what not. Confirmed in an empty VM. Thought other readers may want to know this.\nDisabling the \"Set locale environment variables on startup\" works\nAs does setting \"export LANG=en_US.UTF-8\".

In error, I initially backuped all Apps which I gather is a waste of space on my external back-up drive, so I wanted to delete one file (my one drive) to see if that would work.\nSo how can I remove files from a Time Machine backup nowadays?\n\nA: You can't delete backed-up files in Time Machine on APFS. You can read more about this here:\n\n*\n\n*https://eclecticlight.co/2022/07/19/what-can-you-do-with-time-machine-backups-on-apfs/\n\n*\n\n*\n\nWhat you can’t do\n\n\n\n*\n\nDelete items within a backup: The synthetic snapshots containing your backups are read-only. As a general principle, you can never change an APFS snapshot, and Time Machine’s backups are no exception.\n\nIt is still possible with HFS+ disks. Deleted files from your main SDD / HDD will be tidied up automatically as the device fills up to provide more backup space.\nAlso, having a backup of your apps is good practice. It's not particularly useful to exclude large parts of your machine as Time Machine can function as a restore source in the event of a complete machine loss or corruption. Note that the system will automatically exclude certain things on its own eg. caches and the secure system volume.\nIdeally you want an external device greater or equal in size to your internal disk to make it an effective solution.\n", "Q: How to disable blurry font on macOS - ie. the anti-aliasing or smoothing Recently I was forced to switch from Linux to a MacBook Pro and I am suffering from the font smoothing. I use an external monitor in its native resolution which worked fine with my previous Linux OS. Text on the MBP are unreadable for me.\nI found this command defaults -currentHost write -g AppleFontSmoothing -int 0 to disable the smoothing via Terminal.\nHowever all text remains blurry and my eyes keep trying to focus the text correctly which is very annoying.\nIs there any way to make the text sharper or or perhaps a better font not using the anti-aliasing at all?\nEdit:\nAn example of font anti-aliasing. The screenshot is taken from a Chrome application the bookmark bar with a folder named with uppercase alphabet. I attached the original size of 100 % zoom and 800 % zoom on the same image.\nAll letters have a kind of shadow. Example is the letter H or M where left vertical line has shadow and right vertical does not have it. And letter E with the horizontal lines where middle has shadow and top / bottom does not have such shadows.\n\nSecond screenshot is from Finder with folder named with all the letters. Same condition 100 and 800 % zoom on single picture. The shadows are a bit different but very same blurred effect.\n\nEdit 2\nI took another screenshot from my RedHat Enterprise Linux with Gnome desktop environment & Chrom application bookmark folder to compare the difference.\nApparently Gnome is using smoothing as well but the letters are symmetric with almost same dark colour that makes the text much consistent and easy to read.\n\n\nA: macOS is designed for use on 'hi-DPI' displays, with a high pixel density. It no longer supports \"sub-pixel rendering\", which is required to make text look sharp on lower-density displays.\nIf the density is less than about 150ppi or so, then text will look pretty blurred.\nE.g. a 4K at 27\" gives a density of about 163ppi. A 2K display at 24\" is 125ppi, so borderline.\nBy contrast, the Retina displays on a MacBook pro have a density of between 220 and 260ppi. The 5K 27\" Apple Studio display is c. 220ppi.\nIt's possible that other factors may exacerbate matters: bad cables; certain combination of ports or adaptors at each end; intermediary hubs.\n", "Q: <> and ^° keys switched on Satechi compact backlit USB keyboard Using a Satechi Compact Backlit USB keyboard QWERTZ variant: https://satechi.net/products/compact-backlit-bluetooth-keyboard\nIt is a nice product however < > and ^ ° keys are switched.

For example, use the hidutil command-line tool to remap the 'A' key to the 'B' key as shown in Listing 1. The map array consists of two key/value pairs that contain the source (HIDKeyboardModifierMappingSrc) and destination (HIDKeyboardModifierMappingDstKey) of the key remapping.

Create your custom key remapping in the generator's form and copy resulting .plist file to your system.\n\nA: Workaround in Karabiner Element as follows, which works fine:\n\n", "Q: How to digitize old cassette tape audio using the 1/8\" headphone port on a 2021 MacBook Pro?

I do not know exactly why or what changed, but as a user of OS X 10.9 Mavericks, I have run into this error before. There is nothing wrong with the DMG, it's just in a format your OS doesn't know how to read.\nTry copying the installer out of the DMG in a newer version of macOS, then transferring the files to your El Capitan machine.\nVirtualBox may still not work of course, if the app is inherently incompatible with El Capitan. However, it sounds like you're already using a version of VirtualBox which claims to be incompatible, and works anyway, so you might as well keep trying your luck?\n\nA: VirtualBox 7 does not list support for OS X 10.11, as per this article:\nmacOS hosts (64-bit):\n10.15 (Catalina)\n11 (Big Sur)\n12 (Monterey)\nIntel hardware is required.

I know even less how to use Navidrome after installing it, like changing my music directory or opening the GUI. But that's not my immediate problem.\nI tried to follow the three steps listed first with 1. extracting the binary to /usr/local/opt/navidrome/, but I ended up copying the Unix executable file to the opt folder and not the navidrome subfolder. I can't even see the navidrome subfolder but I can cd to it. Any attempts with sudo to move navidrome the file to navidrome the subfolder say things like \"No such file or directory\" or \"Read-only file system\". I guess my real question is I don't know which working directory to use to move the file one folder down. Example using navidrome as my cd:\nMacBook-Pro:opt me$ sudo mkdir navidrome\nmkdir: navidrome: File exists\nMacBook-Pro:opt me$ sudo mkdir /navidrome\nmkdir: /navidrome: Read-only file system\nMacBook-Pro:opt me$ sudo mkdir /navidrome/\nPassword:\nmkdir: /navidrome/: Read-only file system\nMacBook-Pro:opt me$ sudo mv navidrome.exe /navidrome\nmv: rename navidrome.exe to /navidrome: No such file or directory\n\nSo what do I use for my cd (opt, navidrome, or somewhere else) and where do I use brackets to distinguish files from folders?\n\nA: The issue is that you cannot have a file and a directory with the same name. So if you start with a file named navidrome you have to rename to to a temporary name so that you can create the directory navidrome. Then move the temporary renamed file into the directory with its correct name.\ncd /opt\nsudo mv navidrome n.tmp \nsudo mkdir navidrome\nsudo mv n.tmp navidrome/navidrome\n\nNow proceed with step 2 of the instructions.\n\nA: I just deleted the exe and was able to install and use the program by adding files to the root folder, no need for opt.\n", "Q: TextEdit’s \"Orientation Layout\" Just discovered a very nice feature of Services on the context menu.  In TextEdit, selecting Orientation Layout→Vertical rotates the text and characters 90° clockwise, keeping the window geometry the same.

The various changes that came along with the APFS complicated the process for me and I only managed to somehow turn the NTFS partition into free space but could not merge it into APFS due to 'Container' system I was unfamiliar with.\nOn the other hand, I had a PopOS! live USB at hand, so I tried to convert the free space to a FAT32 partition so that I could at least see that as such in Disk Utility. But had no further success in converting it into APFS & merge with the main partition.\nSo at some point, out of frustration, I decided that I might as well install PopOS! on this 51GB partition so I could try it out for a few days as Linux is generally fast on my 2015 Macbook Pro 13″.\nSome error crept up and it said it was unable to complete the installation. So I dropped the idea & plugged my HDD back into macOS but to my dismay the main APFS container was unmountable.

I am uploading an ISO to GitHub Releases which is around 11GB. But when I try to upload it, it says the max file size is 2GB. Is there any Ventura ISO with the maximum file size of 2GB?\n\nA: GitHub recommends individual files are less than 50 MB and the whole repository of 1 GB or less.\nFor releases the file size is limited to 2 GB.\nThey block files greater than 100 MB, releases greater than 2 GB and require Git Large File Storage or Dropbox for larger files.\n", "Q: Macbook incorrectly sets date time based on my location I've recently upgraded to Ventura and found that the system date time is incorrect.

I am looking for a way to connect two headsets to the same iPhone that will work with popular software for audio calls, e.g. Zoom, Facetime, and Skype.\nBasically, I am looking to put an audio splitter/mixer in front of the iPhone that would communicate with the output/input devices over Bluetooth, split/mix the signals, and communicate with the iPhone via Bluetooth or Lightning.\nTo achieve that kind of control I might have to use professional-grade recording equipment.\n\nI found some products that do something similar, each of them lacks some essential capability:\n\n*\n\n*Diagram 1: Product 1 - no audio output, only for streaming\n\n*Diagram 2: Product 2 - only audio output\n\n*Diagram 3: Product\n3, Product 4 - only one headset can have both audio and mic\n\n\nThe \"headset\" does not have to be a headset in a traditional sense, it could be separate mic, headphones, or even speakers.\nI realize that the iPhone allows only one device with the handsfree BT profile to be attached at a time, so a direct connection is not possible.\n\nA: The closest I could find to this is the Poly Sync series. Two Sync 40 (and higher) devices can daisy chain and connect to an iPhone over BT.\nThe audio output and mic input will be mixed, the whole solution is very user friendly compared to alternatives I was considering initially in the question.\nHave a look:\nhttps://www.poly.com/de/de/products/phones/sync/sync-40\n", "Q: Error on macOS startup - \"The application can't be opened.\" Recently, I updated my Apple ID email address, and I logged out and back into my Apple account within the settings on my 2018 mac Mini (see info below).

I think this may be the deciding factor.\n\nbelow applies to non-retina screens\nYou need to look at the resolution, not the physical size.\nThe Displays pref pane does not consider the physical display size, only its resolution. [It has this information available to it, but it is not used].\nYour Dell is running at full 4k - 3840x2160; the Apple at 2k - 2560x1440.

(After all, if it happens again, will you keep moving on...?)\nA problem specific to one user account means that something within the user account is causing the problem. This could be a corrupt or incorrect preference; or some background process that is set to launch, which is causing a conflict.

On its back I read that it supports: 20V, 1.5A (30W) and 20.3V, 3A (~60W).\nI have read other questions and answers here, but my question is more specific and it does not apply to MacBook Airs only.\nWhat data should I look at when shopping for a new charger, especially when not made by Apple?\nFor example, does the following charger support the 60W requirement of my MBA M1 ?\n\nThere is a mode with 20V, 5A: in this case will the MBA M1 be able to negotiate 20V, 3A? Should I prefer a 65W adapter with 20V/3.25A ?\n\nA: If this charger meets the requirements of the USB-C specs, and it has a higher power rating than Apple's 65W charger, it will work. Power supply/charger ratings are given as \"safe maximum\" ratings; that is, they can safely supply power up to their rated value.\nIt is the device being charged/powered that determines how much power is actually drawn from the charger - not the charger itself. Chargers do not \"force-feed\" power to the load; it does not operate in the manner of gavage does in Foie gras :) . If you connected your 100W USB-C charger to a device (designed for using a USB-C charger) that only used 1 Watt, it would be fine.\nNote this USB-C compliance caveat is very important because USB-C specs allow the charger to deliver up to 20V if the load signals that it is USB-C compliant. If the load does not signal the USB-C charger IAW the specifications, the USB-C charger falls back to 5V - the same output voltage as earlier USB devices provide.\n", "Q: Reset Mac Login Password Using Shell Script Without putting Old/Existing Password (forgotten password) I'd like to script password changes where I don't know the existing admin password and tried unsuccessfully:\ndscl . -passwd /Users/[user short name] [password]\n\nWhen I hit enter, it still asks the existing password to change with the new one.\nand this script also need to existing/old password to reset:\nusername=$1\noldpwd=$2\nnewpwd=$3\n\ndscl . -passwd /Users/\"$username\" $oldpwd $newpwd\nsecurity set-keychain-password -o $oldpwd -p  $newpwd \"/Users/$username/Library/Keychains/login.keychain\"\n\nI tried to use the normal script from the internet, but all scripts are still asking the old/existing password to proceed.\nIs that possible to create a script that can bypass to put the old/existing password?

The only requirement of the user to toggle between 1) saving a file of the screenshot and 2) putting the image only in the Clipboard was inclusion or exclusion of the Ctrl in the sequence.\nSince I started using Cmd+Shift+5, sometimes (a newer version of screenshot that has some nice pop-up options and features), the preference I set in there now seems to govern where my screenshots end up for Cmd+Shift+4 as well?\nFor example, if I hit Cmd+Shift+5 and under Options select Preview in the Save to section, that becomes the new default for Cmd+Shift+4 also.  Adding Ctrl to the sequence ignores the preference and just dumps to the clipboard as before (good).\nI understand I can toggle these back and forth thru Cmd+Shift+5 and Save to options but it's an extra step.  I commonly use Cmd+Shift+5 to capture to the clipboard.\nI would prefer that the Cmd+Shift+4 behavior would remain always saving to a file as a separate preference from Cmd+Shift+5.\nMy question: do others observe this same behavior?  Any workarounds besides toggling manually between preferences in Cmd+Shift+5?\n\nA: I can confirm this is the same right back to Mojave, when it was first introduced.\nBasically, you have two interfaces to the same app & prefs.\nYou can tweak the prefs in Terminal using defaults write, e.g.\ndefaults write com.apple.screencapture location ~/Desktop && \\ killall SystemUIServer\nor\ndefaults write com.apple.screencapture type -string \"png\"\nThere's a full list of commands at https://ss64.com/osx/screencapture.html\nYou could, I suppose, invoke a specific screenshot or prefs change from these parameters & save as an Applescript app or service.\nYou can't tweak the settings separately for each access method, though.

I have a 2017 Macbook Pro and the tech specs online says it's brightness is 500 nits, but it seems very dim in any sort of outside light is nearby.\n\nWhen looking at Macbooks, the brightest I've seen listed is the Macbook 14\" and 16\" and but the specifications are very confusing. They say they have one brightness setting for HDR that runs at 1000 nits and that can peak to 1600 nits (when?) and another brightness setting for SDR that is 500 nits. That's the same as I have right now.\nWhat does that mean? What brightness level is it at for everyday use like surfing the web?\nThe Apple website shows this:\n\nBut it also says SDR is 500 nits:\n\nWhen I was in the store there was no visible difference in brightness when compared side by side with other Macbooks.\n\nA: The Mac with the brightest, built-in display is currently the 14\" and 16\" MacBook Pro. They have a display capable of 500 nits in SDR mode and 1000 nits sustained in XDR mode - with peaks of up to 1600 nits.\nWhat you will experience in \"normal usage\" depends on what is normal usage for you. You indicate that this is browsing the web. That would usually be SDR content, meaning that if you set the display to full brightness, it would be 500 nits.\nWhen you compare that spec to your old Mac - remember that the backlighting (and thus brightness) can actually deteriorate over time.\nYour old MacBook Pro has an LED-backlit display that won't dim as quickly over time as older display technologies, but it does actually still degrade. How much depends on how many hours the display has been on.\nAs I read your question, you basically want to increase general brightness - you're not concerned with peak brightness in achieving optimal contrasts when viewing movies or similar.\nFor your case, you can use the app \"Vivid\" and other similar apps to increase the general brightness of your system on new Macs with XDR displays. Note that this requires a recent MacBook Pro with an XDR display - the app cannot increase general perceived brightness on your older 2017 MacBook Pro.\nIf you're often found using your MBP outside with lots of sun light, this can make a huge difference. Essentially you're going to experience something that comes close to a doubling of brightness. So in this comparison a new 14\" MacBook Pro can have much higher brightness than your older 2017 MacBook Pro.\n", "Q: Export specific key from keychain using command line (by finger print, hash, id?) I'd like to export specific keys from my keychain using the command line. As far as I see, this would involve the security tool. When I have multiple keys with the same name, how can I export a specific one of these keys? Can I specify a key id or hash value? For instance one can specify the type like -t privKeys, but this would not limit the result to a specific key.\nOr going at this from a different angle: Is there a possibility in Keychain Access to view the key id / fingerprint of a key? For instance I have quite a few keys, which all are named the same and \"Get Info\" shows no details which would let me really distinguish one from another. I have a feeling I'm missing something here.\n\nA: No, it is not possible to search by key identifier or hash.\nUnfortunately the underlying Keychain API is limited in the attributes that can be searched for.\nIf you are fortunate, paired certificate and keys exist within a Keychain. These pairings are called Identities within the API. Within Keychain Access they appear as a certificate with a disclosure triangle to one side; expanding the item reveals the paired key.\nOtherwise applications working with Keychain have to enumerate the available certificates and keys to find specific pairs.\nI wrote Keysafe, so am painfully familiar with the underlying .keychain file format.\n", "Q: How to stop dotnet run command?

In order to reduce the amount of power adapters, I would like to use an apple 96W USB-C power adapter on an old MacBook Pro Retina 15\" from mid 2014, with an adapter cable USB-C to MagSafe.\nIs this possible?\nAre there any downsides, like too much power which results in faster loading which in turn produces more heat which in turn decreases battery lifespan?\n\nA: As far as I know, Apple sells only a USB-C to MagSafe 3 cable - not one for MagSafe 2. However, there are other companies who make and sell USB-C to MagSafe 2 adapters. Those would be third party ofcourse.\nIn terms of having a 96W USB-C adapter instead of for example the 87W or 61W USB-C adapter - that's not a problem.

If I go to System Preferences > Network, I can see that I'm connected to both the Ethernet and WiFi networks simultaneously. I want the Ethernet network to be of higher priority (higher on the list) so that most programs use that connection (e.g., when I open a web browser, it connects via the Ethernet network). However, I want to be able to open the terminal and ssh to the microcomputer over the WiFi network that I'm also connected to.\nI know that both connections can be used simultaneously because I can make it work with this order of operations:\n\n*\n\n*Disconnect from the Ethernet network by physically removing the Ethernet jack from the Mac (now WiFi to the other microcomputer is the only connection in System Preferences > Network).\n\n*ssh from the Mac to the address of the microcomputer\n\n*Reconnect to Ethernet by plugging the Ethernet cable back into the Mac. Now I can see communicate with the microcomputer over the ssh connection I established in step 2 but can also use the Ethernet network for all other programs.\n\nI don't like this process because I frequently need to disconnect and reconnect to the ssh connection. I'd prefer to be able to keep my Ethernet cable connected to my Mac but still be able to ssh over the WiFi network.\nThe ideal solution is that there flag I can pass to the ssh command to specify that I want to use the WiFi connection to perform the ssh rather than the Ethernet connection. What is the easiest way to do this from the terminal?\n\nA: Having a WiFi network and Ethernet network connected to the same local area network is not supported. You may be able to make it work marginally, but that isn't going to work reliably and will produce the same symptoms you have now.\nTo make this work, you would need two things:\n\n*\n\n*Two separate networks (one LAN for WiFi and one LAN for Ethernet) with different IP addresses.\n\n*You will need to limit use of DHCP to only one of the two connections, specifically the one you wish to reach the Internet via. The other connection should be hardcoded with a static IP address.\n\n\nA: It sounds like you're running into issues because you essentially end up with a misconfigured IP network.\nTypically a home network with an internet connection uses IP addresses on the form of 10.x.x.x, 192.168.x.x or 172.16.x.x. Your home network would be setup with a so called \"subnet mask\", which specify how large parts of those x's that are actually part of your home network.\nWhen you add the microcomputer to the mix, it comes with its own network setup. Because you mention these difficulties, it seems you have an overlap in two networks now. I.e. both your ordinary home network and your microcomputer network use IP addresses on the same \"form\" (such as 192.168.x.x) with subnet masks that makes these two networks overlap.\nYou can fix this in two ways:\n\n*\n\n*Change the network configuration so that you do not have overlapping, separate networks.\n\nor\n\n\n*Use a work-around to let SSH connect via the microcomputer-connected network interface\n\nFor option 1, how you do this is dependent on what kind of network equipment you use, what kind of microcomputer it is, etc. The general idea is though to make sure the networks are non-overlapping. For example if you use 10.x.x.x addresses on both networks, then make sure that one uses 10.0.x.x and the other 10.1.x.x addresses for example. The subnet mask should reflect that so that instead of having a mask of 255.0.0.0 for example, it would be 255.255.0.0 or similar.\nFor option 2, the work-around, you can actually specify to ssh that you want to connect via a specific network interface (i.e. the WiFi). If your WiFi interface is en1 and you usually connect to the microcomputer on IP 192.168.1.1, that command would look something like this:\nssh -B en1 username@192.168.1.1\n\n", "Q: How to import time machine backup music (or from iphone) to ventura?

Wipe the Mac and hand it over.\nA super MDM for getting started for free is JAMF Now. https://www.jamf.com/products/jamf-now/\nHere is your script for securing the data / software each time it changes hands. Skip the part on the AppleCare since the company owns / manages that Mac in your case. Also, it's fine for the employee to \"register\" it with Apple for support, you should keep the original receipt or sign up for an MDM to manage activation lock / remote reset.\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201065\nSo my top 5 best practices are:\n\n*\n\n*Find out who your Apple Business rep / support channel is. Make contact with them so they can help you out as a business using Apple.\n\n*Try an easy MDM and go very, very light on management and enforcement initially - document what you find, what works, what causes issues or is more work than the benefit. Don't just do things on macOS since you do it on Windows. iOS and iPadOS are lighter management idioms than macOS (traditionally) but they are all converging now to the light touch for most small businesses.\n\n*Do not bind to AD. Leverage an identity provider like Okta / AzureAD and the new SSO extensions rather than binding. You don't need this for fewer than 15 Macs IMO. Just let the employee manage their AD crews manually.\n\n*Think of how you'll fund apps and then work with your MDM / Apple partners to learn what you need to focus on next after 6 months of the lightest possible management you can start with.\n\n*Let the employees roll with AppleID of their choosing for the first dozen or so accounts - you can always claim the work email ID later if needed. Forcing people to use two AppleID is a huge hassle for a small team and will drive up support costs, cause confusion, deliver almost no value to you or the business.\n\n", "Q: How to undo malicious changes to key bindings? My friend used this script (do not run this!!) to change all my keys to h. How can I undo this?\n\nA: hidutil property --set '{\"UserKeyMapping\":[]}'\n\nwill reset the key mappings introduced by this script.\nPS: A reboot should also solve the problem.\n", "Q: Is there any way to make mdfind (the spotlight command line) find symlinks? I use mdfind extensively to look for files on my file system because it is so much faster than find.  In this case, I was looking for README.md files.\nBut today I just realized I was missing some files because they were actually symlinks.\nLet me give you an example:\nrm -rf test\nmkdir test\ncd test\ntouch foo.md bar.md test.txt test2.txt\nln -s test2.txt zoom.md\ncd ..\n\nOK, now if tree it I see:\ntest\n├── bar.md\n├── foo.md\n├── test.txt\n├── test2.txt\n└── zoom.md -> test2.txt\n\nand using find test -name \"*.md\" :\ntest/bar.md\ntest/foo.md\ntest/zoom.md\n\nbut mdfind -onlyin test -name md doesn't match the symlink zoom.md:\n..../test/test/foo.md\n..../test/test/bar.md\n\n\nFrom this, it looks like specifying \"kMDItemContentType == public.symlink\" might help.  It didn't.\nLooked around some more for kMDItemContentType online, but Apple for some reason provides next to no documentation about mdfind advanced usage.\n\nA: The Spotlight index (as used by mdfind) indexes files and folders. But a symlink is not a file.  It is a link to a file.  It is the file which is indexed.\nOn the the other hand, an alias is a file and is indexed by Spotlight. Its UTI is com.apple.alias-file.\nUnless you are prepared to change your symlinks to aliases, the answer to the question is: No, you can't find symlinks with mdfind.\nBut you can use find to search for symlinks.  For example find . -type l -ls finds all symlinks below the current directory.\n", "Q: Upgrading Python in MacOS Monterey I understand Python is used by the OS, and that's why here on Ask Different there are several Q/A about the subject, where answerers tell people to install Python 3.x and leave Python 2.x (used by the OS) alone. That's not an issue because one can have two major versions installed at the same time.\nHowever, my mac (Monterey) came with Python 3.6. What happens if I try to upgrade it to 3.11 (current version at the time of writing), is that going to hurt the OS somehow? If Python uses semantic versioning, logic tells us it shouldn't make any harm, since the major version number is the same, is that correct?\n\nA: Monterey includes a 'stub' for python 3.6. If you try to use it, the OS will invite you to download the Xcode Command Line Utilities, which includes the full install.\nXcode CLU contains a lot of other stuff that you might not want, so I'd recommend downloading python 3.11 from https://www.python.org/downloads/ and installing it.\nThe downloaded python is in /usr/local/bin; the system python is in /usr/bin.\nAs long as /usr/local/bin comes first in your $PATH, then the downloaded python will take priority, and calling python3 will launch the 3.11 version. That's what I do.\nI don't think that macOS 'uses' python at all anymore.\n\nA: I would make sure to install it in a different path\ne.g. /usr/local/bin\nand set the $Path order to use /usr/local/bin first\nOr I would be sure to explicitly call the /usr/local/bin/python3 binary if I wanted to use Python 3.11\nOr I would create an alias to it in your .profile\nOr I would make a symbolic link\nln -s python3.11 /usr/local/bin/python3\nEither way, you could make sure that the 2 pythons were separated into different paths...\nI would hope that Apple's scripts would explicitly call /usr/bin/python3\nso there wouldn't be an issue of using the 'wrong' version.\nHowever, I would hope that 3.11 would run scripts in 3.6 formats without issues.\n", "Q: Cannot find the option \"Allow different input source for each document\" I need to have my keyboard layout settings stick to the applications where I set them.

But then when I go to terminal, I want it to go back to what it was, which is English.\nThe current state is, I switch the keyboard layout, and it's a global setting, so I cannot multitask because I have to keep switching layouts, which is very counter-productive.\nAllow me to add that I'm new to mac... so apologies if this is a dumb question. This kind of setting is standard on Linux and Windows.\nIn MacOS Ventura, 13.01, when I go to \"System Settings\", I type in the search bar \"input source\" (see the screenshot), I see the option in the filtered search \"Allow a different input source for each document\"... is this what I need? I don't know, because I can't see it anyway when I click on it. See the screenshot.\n\nWhere is that option that I filtered for?

When booted I check Activity Monitor and it shows what appears to be 32GB+the usual 0.2GB to 0.3GB of typical boot writes and a couple of GB of reads.\nI've had it once during a verbose boot (Cmd+V) behaves normally, takes seconds to boot, and shows .2 to .3GB of writes and the usual ~2GB reads to get to the desktop, but I've been unable to replicate this.\nI've looked through the console logs trying to find a pause of 40~ seconds between log entries but can't find it.\nIt seems odd it's writing 32GB of data, it seems to be written to /dev/null because there's no trace of any space being used and no files of 1GB+ on the boot volume.\nWhat could this be and what can I try next to troubleshoot this issue?\nThis happens with or without FileVault enabled and doesn't affect the performance of the machine in any way once booted.\nStorage is the internal PCI 3.0 X4 128GB blade SSD.\nThe first screenshot shows that powerd is writing the data.\nThe second screenshot shows a safe boot screenshot and the third is a normal boot after a safe boot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA: After much investigation, I've found the solution.\nI still don't know what exactly powerd process was doing, or why or where it was writing the 32GB of data.\nAt some point I've obviously tweaked the power management settings, and on new installs restoring my data (which I assumed was independent from settings such as that) has restored my tweak to pmset.\nI ran sudo pmset restoredefaults and this has fixed the issue.\nThe system now boots normally, reading around 1.5GB and writing 280~MB.\nIt still doesn't make sense that this is the hibernate file being written, because the system has 64GB of ram, not 32GB. So I still don't know which pmset option I changed to cause this issue, but if anyone else encounters it, at least now we know the fix.\n", "Q: How to have Quick Notes not \"Float on top\" by default I have macOS Monterey, and I use the \"Quick Notes\" hot corner.

I have Alfred 5.0.5 installed, if that helps.\n\nA: The \"Float on Top\" option is gone in macOS Ventura, notes will always float on top there.\nUnfortunately, this means that any solution which may work in Monterey most likely will become useless once you upgrade to Ventura.\n\nA: The closest solution I can come up with is assigning a keyboard shortcut to \"Float on Top\" as per this Apple support page. Although a built-in setting would be preferable, this method will save you time and effort.\nAccording to this StackExchange post, some of the Notes app preferences are stored in ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.Notes/Data/Library/Preferences/com.apple.Notes.plist which you can tweak to your liking.

It not showing anything. The backlight is visible and the brightness is changeable from the touch bar. The machine is turning on and working properly but the display isn't working.\nAfter that some time ago I connected an external display through HDMI to a Type C multiport and saw the computer is working properly.\nI have upgraded the Mac OS Ventura 1 week ago and for the display, I have tried many methods to make it normal like SMC, and PRAM reset. Nothing working.\nNow my question is, what it could be?\n\nA: Likely, it could be the flex cable that connects the logic board to the display; there are known issues with this component.   It could also be a faulty display panel or a failed graphics chip or mux chip (multiplexing chip that sends video to panel, external device or both).\nYour touchbar is actually a separate display device driven by a different chip altogether so what you see there is no indication of the functionality of the main graphics chip.\nRegardless of what it is, it must go in for repair.\n", "Q: Bootcamp usage and size vastly different when checked in Mac vs Windows I had some issues signing into Windows 10 on a Bootcamp partition, and even got the BSOD a one juncture.  It was all coming fast and furious, so I don't recall exactly what happened when.

It shows the Bootcamp partition at 249.82GB (again roughly what I set it up to be as I recall), but it shows a usage 189.22GB and free space at 60.6GB.  So I was hesitant to use the expand filesystem command as it seems something is filling up the drive.  Any suggestions as to how to correct this will be appreciated.  Thanks.\n\nA: Looks like Windows is reporting GiB instead of GB. Also, looks like Mac is determining usage by subtracting free space from partition size.

Can anyone give me a hint where mouse driver files are stored? I'll compare Time Machine backups to see what is missing.\n\nA: You cannot have deleted any part of the OS. It's on a read-only disk volume, and there are other protections to ensure that you can't delete system files.\nCTRL-click is usually an alternative for right-clicking.

Is there an equivalent to requesting native iOS contact permissions that can be triggered on a mobile website, e.g. for the purpose of uploading contacts to a chatting app or social media for social discovery?\n\nA: No, that's possible by default from a web site with existing versions of iOS. For that you will need to have a native app as a helper, or the user will need to enable experimental features.\nAn API for Contacts information do exist for Javascript. However, it is not supported by default on iOS Safari.

This has to be a bug.\nI'm just being stubborn at this point. But I really want a fresh macOS + fresh start. And this annoys me.\nAlso, I like to feel in control of my OS, and what it's doing. And I have absolutely no idea what's going on here.\nI'm guessing Spotlight stores a file on oldPartition which contains recent items. Can I force it to 're-index' so that these recent items are purged?\nOr is there another way?\n\nA: The \"Recents\" folder is not an actual, \"physical\" folder similar to other folders on your computer. It is a virtual folder, and the contents of it is simply computed when it is viewed. This is why you cannot get rid of the its contents by removing the \"Recents\" folder from Finder and adding it back in.\nThe \"Recents\" folder does not by Spotlight storing a file on your drive containing the most recent items. Therefore there's no way of forcing a re-index of this particular file with a list of recent items.\nInstead the \"Recents\" folder simply works by sorting your files according to their \"Last Opened\" time (as seen in Finder), and showing the most recent files.\nIf you want specific files to no longer being the the most recently opened files, you would typically open other files. They would then become the most recently opened files - and eventually the unwanted files would disappear from the list. Another option is to change the \"Last Opened\" time on those unwanted files, so that they are no longer at the top of the list.\nGetting a bit more technical, the \"Last Opened\" time shown in Finder is actually stored on disk as the file system meta data attribute \"kMDItemLastUsedDate\". This value is automatically updated by LaunchServices when you either double-click a file, or some application asks LaunchServices to open that file on your behalf.\nYou can view the \"LastOpened\" time of a particular file using the Terminal by running a command like this:\nmdls -name kMDItemLastUsedDate ~/Desktop/TheFileIWant\n\nNote that not all files have such an attribute. Also note that is not that easy to actually change that attribute.\nIf you for example look at the attribute in Terminal using the xattr command, you'll find that there it is named \"com.apple.lastuseddate#PS\" with #PS\" meaning that the attribute \"sticks\" to the file when it is copied or synced. Just copying the file alone won't remove the last used date from it - the timestamp would be copied along with the file contents.\nYou can delete the attribute from the file like this:\nxattr -d com.apple.lastuseddate#PS myfile\n\nHowever, the attribute is still shown in Finder, and so the file still appears in the Recents folder.\nA \"somewhat simple\" way of getting a file out of the Recents folder is actually to copy it in the Terminal using the cp -X command, which copies the file without the metadata attributes. You would then remove the old file and rename the copy back to the original name. As an example a file named myfile.wav could have its last used attribute removed like this:\ncp -X myfile.wav myfile.wav.copy\nrm myfile.wav\nmv myfile.wav.copy myfile.wav\n\nNote: This also removes other attributes on the file - so be careful if there's something there you want to preserve.\nIf you want to delve even more into the technical details of the \"Recents\" folder, you should note that the folder in Finder is actually simply a saved Spotlight query. You can review the saved searches used by Finder by opening this folder in Finder (by using the Go menu in Finder and choosing \"Go to Folder...\"):\n/System/Library/CoreServices/Finder.app/Contents/Resources/MyLibraries\n\nInside, you'll find a saved search named \"Recents\" which is really what the Recents folder \"is\". Using the Terminal, you can review the definition of that saved search like this:\nless /System/Library/CoreServices/Finder.app/Contents/Resources/MyLibraries/myDocuments.cannedSearch/Resources/search.savedSearch\n\nIn theory you could alter this saved search to exclude the files you want to keep out of the list. In practice, you probably want to mess with system files for such a task. Depending on the macOS version you're running, editing system files could be relatively complicated as well.\n", "Q: Wine or Wineskin on Ventura Everything I can find for Wine or Wineskin is either long untouched or appears to be maintained but says \"up to 10.15\"\nA possible exception is the one installed by brew, which doesn't say what versions it will work on.  I did find the brew version suggested for Ventura, but that was on reddit—not exactly a high-quality source.  (Particularly suspect since it also suggests the apparently obsolete Wineskin as an alternative.)\nI prefer Wineskin for the ability to have self-contained \"wrappers\" but a simple Wine that works is OK.  Any pointer to a version of either known to work on Ventura?\nUPDATE: I just learned about PlayOnMac which also uses Wine.  But where I heard about it called it a \"free program from Apple.\"  It is not from Apple, which makes me a bit suspicious about whether it is \"safe\" to install.\n\nA: Partial answer: three places where it is not known to work on Ventura…\nI re-downloaded a Wineskin-wrapped app that I deleted when it failed in 2017.  Don't know when/if they updated it, but it still doesn't work now.\nNext I decided to take a chance on the reddit advice:\nbrew install --formula gcenx/wine/winetricks\\\nbrew install --cask --no-quarantine gcenx/wine/wine-crossover\\\n\nThat creates /Applications/Wine.app which when launched opens a Terminal with a modified path.

But neither of those machines can do APFS.\nI realize that this will make both unavailable on my laptop when not at home.  But will it cause other problems?  Like, iCloud sync?  Can it be a symlink, or must it actually be in the mount point?\nI know there are other methods, but I prefer the remote mount if it will work.\n\nA: I have done this and it can work; that is, you can put a Photos library file on any volume that mounts in your filesystem and Photos will open it. I have used a Synology NAS and Dropbox folders. However, I found that the experience was brittle- Photos does a lot of processing of photos in the background, for face detection and other things, and if the remote volume becomes unavailable unexpectedly then you will get some corruption of the Photos database. Over time, I saw increasing occurrences of missing/incorrect thumbnails, metadata that would not save, and outright image changes.\nI stopped doing this around the time I upgraded to macOS 12, so I haven't tried it with the most recent versions of Photos and macOS. And my diagnosis of \"database corruption\" is somewhat speculative. YMMV. But I recommend putting some effort into making sure that Photos is not working when you take the laptop out of the house, for example. And you will have to look for its background processes, not just quit the application.\nMy current solution, similar to the link in your question, is to use multiple smaller Photos library files, and to archive older files on external USB harddrives. I use PowerPhotos to manage the libraries.\nI also did the same thing with iTunes libraries, and again, you can put the iTunes (Music) files on any mountable volume. You can also put the actual music files on a remote volume and keep the Music database files on your computer, and multiple Music databases can point to those files. But if the remote volume is ever not available when Music looks for it, it will assume it is gone and create a new default folder for music files, and it will appear that all your music has disappeared. In my case, I was trying to make the music available to multiple people in the house, and I had a few complaints from my wife saying that \"all her music is gone\". So Home Sharing is more convenient and reliable for that for me.\n", "Q: How come I cannot view /Users/foo/ from a second admin user, but I CAN view them from macOS on another partition? I've been trying to get a clean macOS.\nFirst effort was to create a second admin user. I found that userB couldn't see /Users/userA/*.\nSecond effort was to create a second APFS partition, and install macOS onto it (from userA).\nNow my machine boots into macOS_new, and surprisingly I'm able to view /Users/userA/* on macOS_orig.\nSuppose I had somehow created this new APFS partition and installed macOS from outside of userA... would userA's files still be visible to me? If so that's a huge security hole, surely! So I'll assume not.\nIf not, then what's the magic that allows macOS_new to view macOS_orig/userA's files?\nOriginal macOS:\n> ls -lde /Volumes/πTB/Users/pi/\ndrwxr-xr-x+ 111 pi  staff  3552  1 Dec 10:52 /Volumes/πTB/Users/pi/\n 0: group:everyone deny delete\n\n> ls -ldne /Volumes/πTB/Users/pi/\ndrwxr-xr-x+ 111 501  20  3552  1 Dec 10:52 /Volumes/πTB/Users/pi/\n 0: ABCDEFAB-CDEF-ABCD-EFAB-CDEF0000000C deny delete\n\n\nNew macOS:\n> ls -lde /Users/pi/\ndrwxr-x---+ 21 pi  staff  672  1 Dec 15:17 /Users/pi/\n 0: group:everyone deny delete\n\n> ls -ldne /Users/pi/\ndrwxr-x---+ 21 501  20  672  1 Dec 15:17 /Users/pi/\n 0: ABCDEFAB-CDEF-ABCD-EFAB-CDEF0000000C deny delete\n\n\nA: You write:\n\nSuppose I had somehow created this new APFS partition and installed macOS from outside of userA... would userA's files still be visible to me?\n\nAnd the answer is yes, they would be visible to you - assuming that the original is not encrypted with a key not available to you when booting into the other macOS installation.\n\nIf so that's a huge security hole, surely!\n\nThe answer to that is no, that's not actually a huge security hole. That's how file systems work on any operating system on any computer.\nIf you do not encrypt the data, it is available to read when you have physical access to it.\nIn very basic terms, the macOS operating system does limit what non-administrative users can do - this includes reading files that do not belong to themselves. This is handled by adding ownership information to each file stored on the file system, and comparing it to the current user when a file read is requested.\nOn many operating systems, user ownership is stored not by user names, but rather by user ids. The user id is typically a number assigned when the user is created. On macOS the first user created is typically assigned the number 501, the second user the number 502, and so on.\nWhen you mount the file system created by the old macOS installation on your new macOS installation, the operating system will attempt to impose the same restrictions. However, the file ownership of for example \"501\" might now mean an entirely different user, or it might, as in your case, happen to be a user named the same thing. That's entirely up to the order in which you have created the users.\nThis is all very \"non-surprising\", and does not in any manner indicate that there is a security hole in the OS, a bug or anything like that. This is how file systems has worked for decades across many different operating systems.\nIf you want to stop this, you'll want to encrypt your data.\nNote: You can \"skip\" the imposed restrictions simply by accessing the files with a superuser (an admin user). Using the Terminal, you might try to view the contents of a file like this:\nless /Volumes/πTB/Users/pi/secret.txt\n\nand be denied access to the file because of the file ownership and permissions. However, if logged in as an user with Admin rights, you can simply add on sudo to the command, like this:\nsudo less /Volumes/πTB/Users/pi/secret.txt\n\nYou would then be prompted for your (own) password, and then be able to read the file. You do not need the password of that \"other user\" in order to read the file.\n", "Q: Why does Spotlight search no longer work after a system update?

I'm getting ready to move to a newer phone, but with less space, so I'm trying to clean off apps that I don't use and music that I don't listen to.  For some mysterious reason there is a TON of music that I don't think I've ever heard of.\nWhy would music get added to my phone without me intentionally downloading it?  Also, is there any good way to remove lots of things at once?  (It is extremely tedious to do this on the iPhone, where every single item requires one or more individual gestures, which often fail.)\n\nA: I am going to limit the scope of this answer and question only the question in title.\nMusic might be downloaded into your iPhone due to automation. For example with Spotify I have subscribed to this one playlist that keeps changing. I have also set it to download the whole playlist everytime there are new songs added.\nIn your case it really depends on which kind of (music) applications you have downloaded on your phone.\n", "Q: Does using a lower power adapter to prevent fast charging (MBP M1) help preserve the battery? I've gone through old well-answered questions about how to prevent a Mac battery lifespan (Does a low power charger help Macbook's battery, Limiting macbook (usb c) charge level…, Apple recommendations, etc.), and understood that:\n\n*\n\n*It's best to stay between 20 % and 80 % (for all lithium-ion batteries)\n\n*It's not a good idea to use a too-low power adapter (drains the battery)\n\n*Fast charging is not great\n\n*Some recommend using AlDente (or just let macOS manage it)\n\nSomething I still cannot figure out is if it's a good idea to use a power adapter that is not super powerful to charge slower when the Mac is going to stay wired for several days.\nFor example, I have a 140W power adapter sold with a MacBook Pro 2021 16' M1 Pro, wired most of the time. When I use it outside I'm happy that the power adapter charges it to 100 % very fast, but when I'm back home and know it'll stay here for several days, I wonder if it might be a good idea to plug it onto a lower power adapter like the 96W or even the 67W (and leave it to charge and stay at 80-100 % for days on it).\n\nA: I think you would need to discern between a theoretical and a  practical \"preservation of battery life\".\nWould using a lower power adapter, which prevents Fast Charging, help preserve the battery? - Theoretically, yes.\nIn this scenario where the Mac is plugged in for days on end, there would be a very narrow window at the start of your \"several days of staying wired\" - where for some minutes it fast charges, which slightly increases the temperature of your battery - which ever so slightly decreases the life time of your battery more than not fast charging.\nWould using a lower power adapter, which prevents Fast Charging, help preserve the battery? - Practically, not really.\nWould it really matter to you if your battery failed to worked to your satisfaction after 4 years, or after 4 years and 2 weeks? - Especially when you factor in the time you have spent worrying about the life time of your battery and implementing various safe guards.\nUsing free software such as AlDente to limit charging to 80% when staying wired seems like a simple and reasonable thing to do.\nBeyond that, I think spending money on a different, lower wattage charger, is simply not practical. The charger would cost you much more than what you save in terms of having to replace the battery slightly earlier.\n", "Q: How to access or export app data on an IOS device? I have the Bandcamp app installed on my iPhone. This is a music app for indie artists. The Bandcamp app has a section of \"downloads\" which are songs I have downloaded to the device. Some of these songs are rare and from an artist that is no longer on Bandcamp. I cannot access these songs through the Bandcamp web application anymore and are only available cached and downloaded on my iPhone. I would like to export these songs off my phone for backup and archival.\nI have tried using Imazing to access the app data files however the song data seems hidden or unlisted for Imazing to access. I'm looking for other ideas on this data recovery.\n\nA: Through the File system view in iMazing, you should be able to view the data.\nAnother option which most definitely should work is to back your device with iMazing and then explore the backup in iMazing, this way, you will be able to access all the data you were previously unable to access. Make sure when you are viewing data, you chose your newest backup instead of your phone.\nThird option is if second option doesn't work, after backing up your phone, attempt to export the Bandcamp app and explore and unzip the file using 7zip or winrar and you should find the data.\nFourth option is if this app allows it's data to be viewed via iTunes, you should be able to find the Bandcamp app under the \"File sharing\" option of iTunes where you can freely export the data. This however depends on the app developers and whether if they allow you to view this data you want.\n", "Q: How to restore a specific file from APFS Time Machine backup drive with tmutil? I've been using an HFS+ drive for Time Machine, but I recently formatted a drive in APFS as my Time Machine backup drive on macOS Monterey. Now I find the implementation with APFS very confusing.\nIf I list things on the root directory of the drive with ls, the results are as follows:\n.fseventsd\n.Spotlight-V100\n2022-12-03-020353.previous\nbackup_manifest.plist\n\nAnd upon further inspection, 2022-12-03-020353.previous only contains the latest version of files, older backups are not visible. On an HFS+ TM backup drive, there should be a Backups.backupdb that contains all the backups with timestamps, which to my understanding is no longer the case for APFS since Big Sur. Now if I do tmutil listbackups, I still get a list of backup timestamps instantly, which looks like the following, though I don't know what to do with them:\n……\n2022-12-02-151624.backup\n2022-12-02-171818.backup\n2022-12-03-000232.backup\n2022-12-03-020353.backup\n\nFrom what I found online, the older backups are stored as APFS snapshots, the question is though, how do I restore specific files from them? I mean, without the Time Machine GUI, but in the command line with tmutil? On HFS+ drives I can simply do tmutil restore /Volumes/TM/Backups.backupdb/<timestamp>/Macintosh HD/<src> <dst>, how do I do the same thing with an APFS drive? Do I need to mount a specific snapshot first before restoring? How to do that in the command line with timestamps gathered by tmutil listbackups? Because waiting for snapshots for the backup hard drive to appear in Disk Utility.app takes forever.\nApologies if this has been asked before, but search engines haven't been kind to me, all I could find about APFS TM backups were about local snapshots and deleting a backup by timestamp.\n\nA: I figured it out myself, here's the answer, in the form of a Bash script, use at your own discretion. Basically you have to mount a backup snapshot with mount_apfs by its name, which can be obtained through diskutil info, then you can access the files normally with whatever tool you like.\nAlso, I learned that the Time Machine GUI essentially does the same thing, it just mounts all of the snapshots under /Volumes/.timemachine/<backup volume UUID>, but you have to enter the TM GUI once after each re-mount, otherwise it only mounts the oldest snapshot, but the TM GUI isn't controllable from a script (maybe possible with AppleScript? idk). Also, it does mounts all the snapshots when OS restarts.\n", "Q: Is it possible to download apps and install them not through the Apple Store? Every time I want to download some app, download websites would lead to the Apple Store. Is it possible to download apps and install them in an iOS not through the Apple Store?\n\nA: Not easily. By default, i-devices can only install software from Apple's App Store, after it has been approved by Apple. This is the so-called \"walled garden\", which some see as a good thing (increased security and oversight); and which others see a restriction of liberty.\nAs a result, there are (almost) no apps that exist to be downloaded from other sources.\nIt is possible for a developer to create an app and load it onto their own i-devices; it's also possible for organizations to configure iPhones and iPads to include their own software as part of MDM (mobile device management) software.\n", "Q: Permanently disable Spatial Audio in MacOS over entire system I am using MacOS Ventura on Apple Silicon. When previewing video files in Finder (Space button), MacOS insists on playing audio using Spatial Audio on my AirPods Pro. I've tried multiple times to disable Spatial Audio under Menu Bar > Audio > My AirPods > Spatialise Stereo > Off. However, MacOS insists on continuing to use Spatial Audio every time I switch video file in Finder.\nThis is problematic not only because I do not want to hear the spatialized content, but there seems to be several disconnection and playback issues related to Spatial Audio.\nI'm hoping there is a preference setting in Terminal to disable this feature. I couldn't find anything in System Settings.\nIs there way to permanently disable Spatial Audio on MacOS (over all headphones)?\n\nA: Through extensive Googling it seems that no one has figured out yet how to disable Spatial Audio globally. You might want to give feedback about Finder through Feedback Assistant and troubleshoot your disconnection & playback issues related to Spatial Audio.\nIf you want to follow the research of the reverse engineering of AirPods you should follow OpenPods repository.

I also have a Belkin Thunderbolt 3 Dock that can supply 85W.\nI usually use the Mac as a stationary computer and I don't normally use it for prolonged periods of time without a power supply, so the speed of charging is not important to me.\nHowever, I am a software developer, so performance in general, and CPU speed in particular, is very important to me.\nThe Mac works fine with just the USB-C cable to the dock connected, and it does charge in that state. But I could also have both the dock and the power adapter connected, though it is less convenient to have two cables connected rather than one.\nIf I use just the dock, with the lower power, it can obviously take longer to charge, but that is not important to me. What I'm interested in: will the performance of the Macbook ever be negatively affected?\nI know that the Mac will be slower if I have no power at all connected, but when power is connected, does the wattage of that power ever matter?\nIf I'm running a really heavy compilation, that uses all cores, can that go slower if I'm using a less powerful power supply?\n\nA: No, it doesn't affect your performance negatively. Rather it is more likely that having a higher wattage charger could hurt performance (ever so slightly).\nThe reason it doesn't affect your performance negatively is that if your computer for shorter periods of time uses more than energy than your charger can supply - it simply drains from the battery. Ofcourse if you have sustained loads for a very long period of time (i.e. hours) of extremely high load, then you might simply run out of battery, which you could ofcourse say is a total loss of performance.\nHowever, the difference between 85W and what your MacBook Pro can maximally charge is so small, that in practice this is not something you'll run into - unless you have a really edge case of performance hungry work.\nIf you connect the 140W adapter to the computer and the battery is rather low in charger, then it can fast charge the battery very quickly. This will generate some heat, and that could negatively affect performance for sudden, very demanding tasks. Ofcourse that only happens in that short period of time where fast charging happens.\n\nA: TL;DR Yes, it is possible, but unlikely.\nIn general, the wattage drawn by a CPU is dictated by its power needs at any given time. The power adapter and battery only determine the maximum capacity for power delivery.\nPerformance may be throttled by factors such as temperature and/or battery health. Intel SpeedStep technology aims to balance this \"for optimal performance and power efficiency\", and I suspect Apple's M-series chips have a similar feature, akin to Race to Sleep. In any case, if power demand exceeds power supply, performance is likely to be degraded, but for this to happen you must be maxing out the CPU to its absolute limits for an extended period of time.\nIf you insist on getting an exact answer, you can test it yourself for your own setup. This question might be of relevance to retrieve the current power consumption level, although a hardware power usage monitor will give a more accurate reading. To determine the power drawn from your battery or AC adapter, see this Apple support page for up-to-date instructions.\nThis answer from bmike offers some more insights into the dynamic between the CPU and its power supply.\n\nA: Not with the things you are doing.\nIf you use a 45 Watt power supply for example, or an iPad 30 Watt USB C charger instead of the MacBook USB C charger, then your battery will empty, and when your battery is emptied your MacBook will be massively slowed down, say to one GHz, to reduce its power. Then if your tiny little charger manages to get the battery a bit fuller, say ten percent, it will go back to full speed, discharge the battery, it slows down, etc. Over night if you don't use it the battery will charge back to full, and then you can use it for many hours again.\nWith an 85 Watt charger that's not going to happen. Worst case if you have all cores running permanently - and that's hard to do - your battery would discharge very slowly.\n", "Q: Mac with different keyboards I have a MacBook Pro with two large monitors. I like to have a keyboard and mouse in front of each monitor, so I have keyboard/trackpad in the MacBook Pro, an original Apple keyboard/mouse in front of one monitor, and I bought a very cheap Windows wireless keyboard/mouse for the other monitor.\nThe problem is: On the \"Windows\" keyboard the key left of the space bar is marked as \"Alt\" and works like \"Alt/option\", the next key is marked \"Windows\" and works as \"Command\", while on the Mac keyboards the first key is \"Command\" and the next one is \"Option\", so when I type blind I always use option instead of command on the PC keyboard and vice versa.\nProblem: How can I change this? System preferences doesn't seem to think there are different keyboards connected. If this was my only keyboard then System preferences would let me swap option and command, but if I try this then I have the same problem on the Mac keyboards.\n\nA: I would suggest it would be simpler / best use of time (\"KISS\" principle) to buy an inexpensive keyboard designed with MacOS keyboard layout.   I have dual monitors: each monitor has its own external keyboard, which are identical.\nMac and Windows Keyboards are different enough such that mixing the two on the same system is annoying / unnecessary.   Why not just buy an inexpensive MacOS keyboard from Amazon / Walmart / Apple?\n\nA: With the USB Keyboard Connected:\nSettings > Keyboard > Keyboard Shortcuts > Modifier Keys > Select Keyboard: > \"USB Receiver\".\nThen set Option (⌥) Key to \"Command\" and Command (⌘) Key to \"Option\"\n\n\n", "Q: MacOS: Change animation speed of Stage Manager I'm interested in using Stage Manager for MacOS, but I find the window switching animations too slow.\nIs there a way to change the animation speed, e.g. via a Terminal command to alter a .plist setting?\nNB: I believe changing window management animation speeds were possible in older versions of OSX; not sure how it works today in general or with Stage Manager.\n\nA: Turn on the \"Reduce motion\" setting under Accessibility.\n", "Q: zsh ignores the shebang in macOS Monterey Problem\nIn macOS Monterey, a script with a shebang (e.g. #!/bin/sh) is not executed by the indicated interpreter via zsh. For example, the following script will yields the below outcome:\n\nScript\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\necho $SHELL\n\n\nOutput\n% chmod u+x my_script\n% my_script\n/bin/zsh\n\n\nI want my scripts to run with bash. I would prefer that the shebang be respected than entirely change my shell. How can I ensure this happens?\nRelated questions that don't answer mine:\n\n*\n\n*The shebang doesn't work if you're sourcing the script with '.': I'm not\n\n*Run the script like: bash my_script: I want it to respect the shebang, not change my behaviour so I need to check each script before running it with the right shell.\n\n*Change your shell to bash: I wish to keep the standard macOS shell.\n\n\nA: Your script is being run with bash. $SHELL is set once to the path to your login shell when it starts, not a dynamically changing value for the shell currently executing the command that prints $SHELL.\n\nA: One big difference is that bash by default sets the variable SHELL, but zsh doesn't. Therefore in some implementations, the system configuration (for instance via /etc/zshenv) set SHELL as environment variable to the zsh binary; AFIK, Apple is doing this in MacOS.\nbash would set SHELL to the path of its binary, but it does this only if there is no environment variable of this name. You can verify this (while in zsh) with\nSHELL=foo bash -c 'printenv SHELL'\n\n\n(unset SHELL; bash -c 'echo $SHELL')\n\nThe first line will print foo, while the second one will print something like /bin/bash.\nHence, if you want bash to get SHELL to be set, you have to unset it in your zsh before running your bash script. However, since the cases where this variable is actually needed are rare, I don't think this is worth the effort.\n", "Q: Bizarrely, Pages does not share a custom dictionary with a document.

I recently purchased an LG UltraFine display. On the back it has a USB-C (Thunderbolt 3) port to connect to the computer (no other ports - there are some downstream USB-C ports but that's it). When I connect the display to my recent MacBook Pro, it works fine.\nHowever, I also have an older iMac (27-inch, Late 2014) that I'd like to try to connect it to... if I can hook it up somehow! The 2014 iMac has some USB-A ports on its rear, as well as Thunderbolt 2/MiniDisplayPort. Some googling suggests the Thunderbolt 2 port won't work, as no adapters exist. So, it feels like my best option, if it's possible, is to connect the USB-C monitor to the iMac via USB-A.\nCan this be made to work? If so, what do I need to connect it? I'm not worried about getting full resolution or anything, just using it as an external monitor with the iMac at all.\n\nA: I googled and found the following Apple website.\nUse the LG UltraFine 5K Display with your Mac or iPad\nThis website does state (though a link) that this monitor will work with your 2014 iMac, but will require the use of Apple's Thunderbolt 3 to Thunderbolt 2 adapter.

All the examples I've seen for Fairplay streaming certificates are 1024 bit RSA, but unless I missed it, it doesn't actually mention that as a restriction in the documentation...\nI'm approved for it, but don't want to try it without confirmation that it'll work since they will only issue one certificate :)\nSo... can I use an ECDSA certificate? (secp256k? is there any limit?) or... is there a good reason why people are using 1024 bit RSA certificates?\n(Also... since Fairplay is only used with Apple devices, which all have built in device certificates themselves... when sending the certificate to the client, is there any way to encrypt it such that the user can't easily see the certificate? Ideally I could encrypt it with the user's device certificate, and therefore know for sure the request came from a genuine Apple device.)\n\nA: You can only use 1024 bit RSA certificates. If you try to submit for example a 2048 bit certificate signing request to Apple, it will be denied.\nIn the Deployment Package you have received from Apple, it is detailed how to generate the correct type of certificate signing request for FairPlay Streaming.\nYour suggestion about encrypting the certificate before sending to the client doesn't really make sense. In the process of creating the certificate, you will create a private key, a certificate signing request - and you'll have the certificate itself. The private key must be kept absolutely private. The signing request is shared with Apple. The certificate itself is meant to be public - it is by design exposed to clients when streaming so that the validity of the certificate can be checked by the client.\n", "Q: How to view iPhone backup contents WITHOUT a 3rd party app? Most solutions that have you viewing contents of an iPhone backup have you using a 3rd party solution. There are many such products out there, and not all of them are free.\nAccording to at least one user, it seems there is a way to view the contents without a 3rd party app:\n\nThis solution worked as a charm! I manually found the TrustStore.sqlite3 in my backup (I don't trust those apps that do that), then followed your instructions. – Ian Dec 17, 2019 at 21:53\n\nHowever, even though I have an unencrypted backup, when I try to look at the contents of the backup, its content are split/garbled in many different files/folders like:\n\n*\n\n*00\n\n*0a\n\n*0b\n\n*etc.\n\nHow do I manually view the contents of these files WITHOUT a 3rd party app?\n(An acceptable solution could also point to code that I could manually run to un-garble these files)\n\nA: Although it looks like a sparse disk image, the backup file format is actually pretty simple. The only difficult part is figuring out the actual file name of each file since Apple uses a fileID of random numbers/letters instead of an actual file name. You can figure out the file name by examining the Manifest.db file, though:\n\n*\n\n*Create a local backup (only tested with unencrypted backup).\n\n\n*Open the Backup folder.\n\n\n*Open the Manifest.db in a SQLLite viewer.\n\n\n*Find the file you're looking for (e.g. TrustStore.sqlite3) under the relativePath column. Look at the value in its fileID (this will be a random list of numbers and characters).\n\n\n*In your backup, find the corresponding fileID, and rename it to the name you saw in the relativePath column (e.g. TrustStore.sqlite3).\nE.g. if the fileID says 03ab1c2a…, look for the file under the 03 subfolder in your backup.\n\n\n*You can now use the file as you normally would.

This will show an icon on images that haven't been copied to your library, and still reference the original.\nYour library size may not update immediately or at all due to how folder sizes are calculated in most file systems, so this approach is more reliable.\n\nA: This isn't the answer that I wanted to post, but sometimes the answer is simple.\n\n*\n\n*Turned off iCloud Photos\n\n*Quit the Photos app\n\n*Restarted my Mac\n\n*Opened Photos\n\n*Turned iCloud Photos back on\n\n...and it started syncing photos right away.

I cannot remember if I have used rsync in the past for the problematic folders. Rsync seems to be working now but simply copy-paste produces the error.\n\nA: I suspect you are trying to copy files in Finder that you have previously copied using rsync (from your included tags, and the screenshot). I spent quite some time a few weeks ago with exactly the same problem, where I was trying to delete files on a Samba share that I had previously copied from Mac to my NAS using rsync. I'd originally used rsync for its ability to resume after failure and be a bit more transparent in progress while moving 300GB+ of data, rather than rely on the opaqueness of Finder's progress bar.\nA good possibility is that the issue is due to invalid characters in the filenames that were caused by a missing UTF-8 conversion in the rsync copy. I found this with a lot of accented characters in the filenames of a lot of music files (too many Krautrock umlauts...). When viewed in Midnight Commander via the share, the first character was invariably invalid and represented as ?. Finder did not show the filename as invalid, but refused to touch it otherwise with the same error you are experiencing.\nApparently there are different 'Normalisation' forms of UTF-8 encoding, and macOS uses an Apple specific one which needs to be accounted for in any rsync copy to a non-macOS machine.\nThere is a good explanation of the problem in this Question.\nRsync with Linux server: special character problem\nAnd the (very) technical explanation for different Unicode Normalisation Forms here. It's to do with methods for string comparisons, amongst other things.\nhttp://unicode.org/reports/tr15/\nApparently the conversion should always be --iconv=utf-8-mac,utf-8 regardless of direction. This is because the order is --iconv=LOCAL,REMOTE,  not from, to . As the local is always macOS this works as expected.\nNow, you did not specify whether the external disks were attached directly to your Mac, or whether they were hosted on another machine. If they are on another networked machine you will probably have to work with them directly on that machine. If the disks are local (HFS+ or APFS) you might be able to 'fix' the affected files by attempting an rsync local-to-local copy using  the --iconv=utf-8-mac,utf-8 conversion. I have not encountered this with locally attached disks so cannot provide any sort of guarantee.\nrsync -aivP --iconv=utf-8-mac,utf-8 local_source local_destination\nAlso, ensure you are using a current version of rsync. The one supplied with Ventura is too old, so use one installed from Homebrew or similar.

On some videos (also in images etc...) I've noticed my Macbook pro 14\" 2021 overexposes the screen when the brigness is really low. It is very annoying. Here is a recording of the issue:\nHere is the screen recording of my issue: https://i.imgur.com/2TgZFIk.mp4\nHere is the video of my issue: https://i.imgur.com/y2z7WUD.mp4\nyoutube video in used in example: https://youtu.be/5rWS705T03s?t=17\nI've googled but nothing comes up. How do I prevent my screen overexposing?\n\nA: I'm not really sure how this works with an XDR screen & I don't have one in the building to test - but, the youtube video is either in Rec709 or sRGB, both of which are 'non-HDR' formats.\nYou're trying to expand to full XDR gamut something which simply doesn't have that colour range in it. Test on the lower gamuts, 601, 709 & sRGB - they're more likely to look closer to intended.\nAs an example, this is what it should look like on a fully-calibrated display & workflow. Your original P3 gamut is already 'over-cooking' it.\nThis is tested on a display calibrated to Adobe RGB, which is a smaller gamut than P3, but wide enough that I can see most of P3. I have a P3 display here but it isn't calibrated [though a quick check on it shows broad agreement.]\n\nScreenshot of your video so we can directly compare, using the same profile for both.\n\nBoth images are now sRGB, with embedded profile, so we have a level playing field for comparison.\nOrdinarily, your display should have a single profile [preset] at which it should be able to auto-map colours correctly. I'm aware this is going to be slightly different for XDR, but also I know the extended range 1600 nit setting is only intended to work on truly 'HDR' images.\n", "Q: KeepassXC update A new release of KeepassXC has been released and I want to update it on my MacOS M1.\nHowever, when I try it:\n% brew upgrade --cask keepassxc \nError: Cask 'keepassxc' is not installed.\n\nProbably because I haven't originally installed with brew?\nHow do I update it then?\nI am afraid to substitute the app in Applications will delete the database.\n\nA: \nProbably because I haven't originally installed with brew?\n\nExactly.

An internal error has occurred I have an iMac 18,2 with the current operating macOS Sierra. Now I want to clean install the existing OS using macOS High Sierra v10.13.6, I went to the recovery mode, connect to wifi and click on Reinstall but the issue that I encountered is whenever I try to install it I get the following error:\n\nAn error occurred while preparing the installation. Try running this\napplication again (I tried this more than 5 times and still get the\nsame error).\n\nScreenshot of the above error:\n\nI spent a couple of hours trying to find a solution and one of them said that I need to delete the Macintosh partition or check on the partition disk for error first.

Thank you...\nPS: this imac originally came with MacOS High Sierra but it was mistakenly downgraded to Sieera\n\nA: High Sierra was the first 'transition' OS to support APFS.\nBecause it was always expected to be updating from Sierra, it doesn't want to see an APFS drive itself. It wants to see an HFS+ drive it can itself convert as part of the installation process.\nYou presumably have all important data already backed up to another location, so you should be able to use Disk Utility to re-format to Mac OS Extended (Journaled), GUID Partition Map.\nThis should then let the High Sierra installation proceed.\n", "Q: Can I create a new Admin profile and keep all existing files/data? A Mac is being used in a school with an Admin profile of a ex-member of staff.

You have many cases where applications have dependencies on the specific user profile. Especially for Mac admin - sysadmin types. Compiled code, secrets in the keychain, hard coded paths, Apple Remote Desktop passwords, scripts, groups and collected data, etc..\nHowever, you should make two backups of this Mac immediately. One backup should be bootable with a reputable software (Carbon Copy Cloner or Super Duper) if you can't use Disk Utility to \"restore / clone / asr\" a backup. The other should be Time Machine - make sure no files are excluded just to be safe.\nThen once you have two backups you can evaluate if you have enough space to make a new generic admin user account and then restore files from the backup to the new account and test.\nDo you have a list of software, apps, documents you know or are you a bit in the dark and have more questions than answers yet?\nMost consumer apps, data, files care nothing about the home folder or identity of the user, so you can usually do exactly what you seek, however I would urge caution and get a new machine and hire someone and make this their problem to solve / document / manage as part of their duties.\n", "Q: MacBook not using any physical memory? I have a MacBook Pro, 15-inch, 2017 running Ventura 13.0.1. It occasionally acts sluggish. Since using CleanMyMac to free up RAM, activity monitor shows \"0\" for physical memory used. It has been this way for over a week. Is this something to be concerned about? Is there a way to check if memory management is working properly?\n\n\nA: Free RAM is wasted RAM. The OS is designed to use as much RAM as it can. I have 32Gb RAM, and the value of \"Memory Used\" added to \"Cached Files\" is nearly always 32Gb.\nFurthermore, RAM usage is not like \"a jug filling with water\":- there is memory compression, caching, swap, virtual memory, and all kinds of other tricks.\nIf you have a problem with your Mac being sluggish, then you need to find out what the cause is before you can fix it. Are any processes using high CPU? Are any processes using large amounts of memory?\nTools like CleanMyMac are largely unnecessary, and not beneficial for troubleshooting.\n", "Q: Is there a way to find iPhone IMEI number before phone arrives?

It has the model number, serial number, IMEI, and other things.\nIf buying online, I don't think Apple puts that information in the invoice.  I know things I've bought, I get an e-mail that does not have any of that.\n", "Q: Force disabling AWDL on Ventura or above Somewhere around macOS Ventura or Monterey, Apple changed the built-in Wi-Fi kernel driver so that the virtual device for AWDL represented in ifconfig now passes the activation state of AWDL data transfer calls through to the interface state directly. This means that disabling AWDL via ifconfig awdl0 down no longer works; any services using AWDL will immediately reenable it in less than a second. Previously, disabling the AWDL interface disables it for a long time, usually until the Mac wakes from sleep.\nAllowing AWDL discovery when it is unneeded causes significant jitter and overall degraded network performance on Wi-Fi if there are many Bonjour-discoverable devices in the proximity, especially noticeable on latency-sensitive protocols such as remote access (ssh) or remote desktop, and the only known workaround is now broken too.\nIs there a way to temporarily (or even permanently) disable the awdl0 virtual interface in Ventura?\nPossible ideas:\n\n*\n\n*Unload the awdl0 interface\n\n*\n\n*Both ifconfig awdl0 delete and ifconfig awdl0 unplumb fails with SIOCIFDESTROY: Invalid argument\n\n*Interface is loaded by the Airport driver (AirportBrcm*) alongside normal Wi-Fi driver functionality, unloading the driver will remove internet access\n\n\n\n*Disable or modify frameworks that applications use to make kernel calls for AWDL functionality\n\n*\n\n*Requires changes inside the system image, bad for security as this requires bypassing signing\n\n\n\n*Disable the interface whenever it goes up by watching ifconfig\n\n*\n\n*Doesn't solve lag spikes\n\n\n\n\nEdit: Latency graph demonstrating AWDL's new behaviour on Ventura and impact on wireless performance, plotted with gping at 20 pings per second to another host. Notice that it is not a flat latency increase, but adds incredibly high amounts of jitter.\n\nIt isn't just AirDrop that can spontaneously enable AWDL; simple Bonjour discovery or even Apple TVs can activate it too.\n\nA: Try upgrading to MacOS Ventura 13.1 and disabling Bluetooth and Airdrop, and then re-enabling them.\nI did that (as suggested in the link shared by nohillside)  and the issue seems to have gone away for me..\nEdit: after further observation, the issue seems to be back intermittently, albeit with a lower frequency than before. So this is not a permanent fix, but does seem to improve things somewhat.\nImmediately prior to posting this answer, I reported the bug at Apple, ID FB11890071.\n\nA: https://wlanprofessionals.com/an-overview-of-apple-wireless-direct/\nIt appears that AWDL prefers channel 6 on 2.4Ghz and channels 44, 149 on 5Ghz. Channel 149 seems to be preferred over other channels. Switching the Wi-Fi network to channel 149 seems to avoid the delay for the radio to hop channels.\nThis doesn't fix the issue but it may be a good workaround.\n\nA: Hey I've been struggling with this issue for several years like you. I kept trying to disable AWDL on Ventura like you said but I noticed it wasn't having any effect. Then I saw a suggestion online to disable Universal Control through System Settings and that seems to mostly fix the issue. I still get the occasional lag spike every 2 minutes in PS Remote Play but it seems to have fixed my issue. Perhaps Universal Control (a relatively new feature) uses some sort of backdoor approach to look for new iPads and MacBooks to communicate with constantly and is what reenables AWDL. But if you toggle the Allow your pointer and keyboard to move between any nearby Mac or iPad setting and ALSO disable AWDL it seems to fix the issue. Hope this helps!\n\nA: This might not solve root cause, but I am trying to implement a \"bandaid solution\" as suggested by OP's 3rd solution: watching awdl0 and make it down the moment it goes up. Obviously, watching for ifconfig would be quite a waste of resource and the ping spikes will still happen in the short window between polls, so I am taking the API approach to implement this.\nThe link to the app is here: https://github.com/jamestut/awdlkiller\nThis app monitors awdl0 via AF_ROUTE. macOS will notify this app the very instant awdl0 goes up, and this app will then use ioctl to put awdl0 back down again. Practically zero ping spikes in my case.\nEven consecutive ifconfig invocations are no match for the cheetah-like response of this app!\n$ sudo ifconfig awdl0 up; ifconfig awdl0\nawdl0: flags=8802<BROADCAST,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST> mtu 1500\n    options=6463<RXCSUM,TXCSUM,TSO4,TSO6,CHANNEL_IO,PARTIAL_CSUM,ZEROINVERT_CSUM>\n    ether <redacted>\n    inet6 <redacted>%awdl0 prefixlen 64 scopeid 0xf\n    nd6 options=201<PERFORMNUD,DAD>\n    media: autoselect (<unknown type>)\n    status: inactive\n\nPlease let me know how it goes for you all.\n\nA: I've been struggling with this issue only for the past few months. I noticed it soon after an update I had applied around September and it's had a noticeable negative impact on my virtual meetings over Zoom and Teams (especially the latter for some reason) and file transfers (like Time Machine backups to my NAS).\nI apparently don't have enough rep to reply to other's comments, but wanted to draw attention to and say thanks very much to AdriftAtlas (sorry, not sure how to link to your name) for his comment here, post MacRumors, and posts in a couple of Reddit threads. I had researched this issue a few times over the past months and only yesterday did I find his posts -- they've been amazingly helpful to me in understanding why this is happening and how I might work around it.\nI'd like to flag for those in Europe or, like me, the UK: you likely can't switch your wifi to channel 149 as suggested by AdriftAtlas. But it seems awdl knows not to use channel 149 in Europe/UK either. I can and have switched to using channel 44 instead and it's working a charm on this issue.\nSo if you're in Europe or UK and can't switch to 149, or can but find switching to 149 doesn't help, try channel 44 instead.\n(My quickest way to test is to use the 'sudo ifconfig awdl10 down' command to stop it, run a ping, then open a finder window and click onto Airdrop; when my router isn't set to channel 44, I'll quickly see my pings go high; after switching it to channel 44 and repeating, I see no significant change in pings.)\nI found this post here because I'm still wanting to find out how to feed this back to Apple.

I want to backup the virtual macOS, not the host macOS. Possible? And then I want to do something even more voodoo. I want to take this Time Machine backup (from a virtual macOS) and install it on a real MacBook. Feels like it is going to explode, but maybe not.\nMy goal is to set up my new macOS environment (apps, configuration, etc) through VirtualBox inside my old MacBook and take a backup of the virtual macOS (not the host one running on my MacBook), then 2 months from now, when my new MacBook arrives, I'll simply copy one of these backups to my new MacBook and I'm ready to go!\n\nA: Yes, this can be done. There's really nothing special to it.\nWhen you open up macOS inside the virtual machine, go to the \"Devices\" menu in VirtualBox, then \"USB Devices\" and select your Time Machine extern hard drive to get it mounted inside the virtual machine.\nFrom there macOS inside the virtual host should recognize the disk and allow you to setup Time Machine backups as usual.\nWhen your new MacBook arrives, just connect the external USB hard drive to the new computer, and let it restore from that during initial setup.\nNote: Double-check that you have setup your VirtualBox for the highest possible speed USB.

I have a MacBook Pro 15-Inch \"Core i7\" 2.8 Mid-2015, running Catalina 10.15.7 - detailed specs here:\nhttps://everymac.com/systems/apple/macbook_pro/specs/macbook-pro-core-i7-2.8-15-dual-graphics-mid-2015-retina-display-specs.html\nMy question is about the meaning of some of the variables displayed when I run sysctl -a.\nMy understanding is that I have 1 CPU package, 4 cores, and 8 logical cores (implemented with hyperthreading, so 2 hyperthreads per core), corresponding to these variables, which all make sense to me:\nhw.packages: 1\nhw.physicalcpu: 4\nhw.physicalcpu_max: 4\nhw.logicalcpu: 8\nhw.logicalcpu_max: 8\n\n\nHowever, I don't understand the meanings of these apparently related variables:\nmachdep.cpu.logical_per_package: 16\nmachdep.cpu.cores_per_package: 8\nmachdep.cpu.core_count: 4\nmachdep.cpu.thread_count: 8\n\nIt seems that:\nmachdep.cpu.core_count: 4 corresponds to the number of physical cores,\nmachdep.cpu.thread_count: 8 corresponds to the number of \"hyperthreads\", and\nmachdep.cpu.cores_per_package: 8 corresponds to the number of \"virtual\" cores seen by the operating system.\n(Will these last two variables always have the same value? What is the difference between (virtual) cores per package and thread count?)\nMost confusing is machdep.cpu.logical_per_package: 16. My only thought is that somehow the number of hyperthreads per core was multiplied by the number of cores per package in error.\nSo those are my guesses, but I'd like to know: What exactly do these variables refer to?\n\nA: tl;dr: This is correct behavior, as designed by Intel.\n\nDetails:\nmachdep.cpu.logical_per_package is implemented in the kernel in bsd/dev/i386/sysctl.c:\nstatic int\ncpu_logical_per_package SYSCTL_HANDLER_ARGS\n{\n    __unused struct sysctl_oid *unused_oidp = oidp;\n    __unused void *unused_arg1 = arg1;\n    __unused int unused_arg2 = arg2;\n    i386_cpu_info_t *cpu_info = cpuid_info();\n\n    if (!(cpuid_features() & CPUID_FEATURE_HTT)) {\n        return ENOENT;\n    }\n\n    return SYSCTL_OUT(req, &cpu_info->cpuid_logical_per_package,\n               sizeof(cpu_info->cpuid_logical_per_package));\n}\n\nThis sysctl returns the cpuid_logical_per_package field of the cpu_info structure. To see how that field is populated, we examine osfmk/i386/cpuid.c:\nstatic void\ncpuid_set_generic_info(i386_cpu_info_t *info_p)\n{\n\n...\n\n    cpuid_fn(1, reg);\n\n...\n\n    if (info_p->cpuid_features & CPUID_FEATURE_HTT) {\n        info_p->cpuid_logical_per_package =\n            bitfield32(reg[ebx], 23, 16);\n    } else {\n        info_p->cpuid_logical_per_package = 1;\n    }\n\n...\n\n}\n\nThe first part of this function executes the Intel x86 CPUID instruction with an operand value of 1, which will gather certain information from the CPU and populate the E[A,B,C,D]X registers with it. Later on, we examine bits 16-23 of the EBX register and save them into the cpuid_logical_per_package field.\nTo understand the meaning of what will be found in that bitfield of EBX, we turn to the Intel Software Developer's Manual, Volume 2A, Chapter 3, Page 215 (CPUID—CPU Identification), and find the register definition for the 1 opcode:\n\nThe part we're interested in says:\n\nBits 23 - 16: Maximum number of addressable IDs for logical processors\nin this physical package *.\n*- The nearest power-of-2 integer that is not smaller than EBX[23:16] is the number of unique initial APIC IDs reserved for addressing\ndifferent logical processors in a physical package. This field is only\nvalid if CPUID.1.EDX.HTT[bit 28]= 1.\n\nSo what this is telling us is that the sysctl selector name \"cpu_logical_per_package\" is a misnomer. It tells you the valid range of ID numbers that the interrupt controller may use to identify logical CPUs and this does not necessarily correspond to how many logical CPUs you actually have.\nThe situation is analogous for machdep.cpu.cores_per_package, which is generated in cpuid_set_cache_info() in the same osfmk/i386/cpuid.c file:\nstatic void\ncpuid_set_cache_info( i386_cpu_info_t * info_p )\n{\n\n...\n\n    reg[eax] = 4;           /* cpuid request 4 */\n    reg[ecx] = index;       /* index starting at 0 */\n    cpuid(reg);\n\n...\n\n    info_p->cpuid_cores_per_package\n            = bitfield32(reg[eax], 31, 26) + 1;\n\n...\n\n}\n\nAnd looking at the SDM:\n\nSo the moral is:\nYou should rely on machdep.cpu.core_count and .thread_count to determine the actual number of physical and logical cores, respectively, and regard the other two fields as being useful only to programmers who need to work with the kernel and have a specific need to know the maximum addressable ID for logical and physical processors.\n\nIf you're still wondering why a logical or physical processor is allowed to have a higher ID than the actual number of processors available on the silicon, the reason is that it's a result of the way that silicon is manufactured. Chip fab is an enormously expensive and complex process, and any reduction in complexity is going to save millions of dollars. It turns out to actually be cheaper to manufacture a chip with eight physical cores etched into the die and then burn a few one-time-programmable internal fuses to disconnect four of the physical cores from that circuit, than it is to create dedicated masks and tooling for a totally separate four-core die. So Intel makes a bunch of 8-core chips and then sells the amputated 4-core version for cheaper.\nAs far as most of the rest of the chip is concerned, though, it still thinks that it has 8 cores. Each subsystem on a processor has a unique ID by which the rest of the subsystems can identify it, and these IDs are physically implemented as arrays of transistors that build up a sequence of binary 1s and 0s to represent a decimal number. Because these IDs are made from transistors, they are immutable parts of the mask and they do not change even if the OTP fuses are blown to disable half the cores. So you may end up with an original 8-core chip having, e.g., logical core IDs ranging from 0-15 but the cheaper 4-core version only uses IDs 8-15 and the first 0-7 are not actually addressable. Hence the numbering scheme can go higher than the actual number of cores you have available to you. Hope that makes sense!\n", "Q: I want to be able to quit Finder but can't edit Finder's Info.plist after disabling SIP I'm trying to edit /System/Library/CoreServices/Finder.app/Contents/Info.plist on my MacOS Ventura (13.01) to be able to quit Finder (remove from tab switcher):\nm@ms-MacBook-Pro ~ % csrutil status                                                    \nSystem Integrity Protection status: disabled.\nm@ms-MacBook-Pro ~ % ls -lO /System/Library/CoreServices/Finder.app/Contents/Info.plist\n-rw-r--r--  1 root  wheel  restricted,compressed 12331 Oct 28 10:43 /System/Library/CoreServices/Finder.app/Contents/Info.plist\n\nAny hint on how to remove restriction?

I just bought a used iPhone 8, my first Apple product.\nThere is an iPhone User Guide from Apple.  My normal practice with user manuals in electronic form is to download them in a standard, widely supported file format (almost universally PDF), and save this permanently into my LAN fileserver (which runs Solaris and serves SMB to Windows clients).\nWith just about any other manufacturer on the planet, for any product from an Earth station antenna control system to a toaster, this would have been a dead-simple matter of vising their website using any standards-compliant web browser on a computer running any operating system, locating the manual's download link, and using the browser's \"Save As\" function.\nThis is proving to be a little more complicated in this particular case.  I did find a web page that tells me the document exists, but seems to be devoid of any link to it:\nhttps://books.apple.com/book/id6443146864\nIt seems that I must access it through the proprietary \"Apple Books\" portal.  After reaching more Apple web pages that were devoid of anything actionable, I somewhat concluded that my only way of accessing this is through the iPhone itself.  (I'm slightly curious as to whether these web pages would do anything on a Mac...)\nAfter some Apple ID rigmarole and then tapping on a \"Get\" button that did absolutely nothing, I finally found that if I instead opened a sample of the book, the \"Get\" button at the top of the sample actually worked, albeit only after setting up an iTunes account.\nSo now, the manual is in some manner in the iPhone.  I'm able to flip through its pages in the iPhone.  But I still want it as a PDF, EPUB, or other standard file on my fileserver.  I'm not sure how much closer this brings me.  I did find this tip:\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/7514400?answerId=30001597022#30001597022\nIt mentions that, due to DRM, books can't be read on non-Apple systems unless they're free.  But this one is free, so that shouldn't be an issue.  The thread also says:\n\nTo redownload actual ibooks, go to the Purchased link under Quick Links on the right-hand side of the iTunes Store homepage\n\nSo I install iTunes into a Windows VM, log into it using the same Apple ID I had used on the iPhone, find \"Purchased\" under \"Quick Links\", and then select the \"Books\" button at top right.  The main window area just displays \"You do not have any purchased books available to download.\"\nAnother idea was to try to get the iTunes Store in the iPhone to save it into some well-defined location in the phone's storage, from which I could copy it out.  I tap \"More\" and there is a \"Purchased\" menu item, but going into that, I see only Music, Movies, and TV Shows categories.  Nothing about books.\nThis other question has some answers but they look like they apply to Macs, not iPhones:\nLocating the iBooks folder in iCloud Drive\nI tried connecting the iPhone to a PC via USB, just to see what I could find.  The Internal Storage directory exposed via MTP has a DCIM folder for the camera, but nothing else.  In principle maybe I could first copy the document from wherever the Apple Books app has it cached into the Internal Storage directory, but I'd need access to the phone's underlying filesystem.  There's a \"Files\" app, but it seems to have no meaningful access to the actual filesystem.  The \"On My iPhone\" category is empty, but the phone is obviously not empty, or it wouldn't boot.\nI've even taken the unprecedented step of searching torrent sites for the official user manual of a consumer product.  No luck.\nIs it even possible, given just an iPhone plus non-Apple systems, to obtain the iPhone User Guide as a computer file under my control?  If so, how would I go about doing this?\nIf the only solutions would involve jailbreaking the iPhone, I'd have to hold off on it for a little bit until it has a replacement, in case it gets bricked.\n\nA: The iPhone user guide is distributed in two formats:\n\n*\n\n*Apple Books, which you've already discovered and linked to. This format can be viewed on your iPhone or on a Mac with the Books app.\nIt does seem like you can export the book to a .epub on Mac, but I can't find a way to export it with just a phone. I'm also unable to verify if it has DRM.\n\n\n*What I recommend for viewing on your computer, a series of webpages, at: https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone\nYou can save these webpages like any other webpage, but of course not in one single action - it would have to be done per page.\n", "Q: How to assign a keyboard shortcut to just the Command key on Mac OS Coming from linux (KDE) I was able to assign a keyboard shortcut to the meta key.

Photos are quite aggressively cropped when printed from Photos to a Canon Selphy CP1300 photo printer. This also occurs when printing from Preview, and I would expect it to be the same whatever application is used, because I suspect that the issue is probably the printer itself.\nPrint settings: 100x148mm, borderless (Canon's driver calls it \"Postcard\").\nThis is not just a case of cropping to fit the aspect ratio of the 100x148mm photo paper. It crops substantial amounts from all four sides of an image. The preview of the image in the printer dialog is pretty inaccurate - the yellow border below shows the amount of material that is lost when printing.\n\nIn most cases, it's no more than mildly annoying, but it ruins some where the edges of the photo really matter.\nI'm guessing the culprit is probably the printer rather than the driver, because the same image output as PDF via the same driver is correct.\nIs there some way to prevent this? If it's the printer doing this with the image it receives then it's really problematic. There are some that I could resize to try to counteract the cropping, but that's a) an idiotic thing to have to do and b) impossible in some cases.\n\nA: No, it doesn't seem possible to prevent this from happening. The same behaviour is observed when printing from an image on an SD card attached directly to the printer - so this is not in fact related to macOS at all.\n", "Q: Unicode woes on a MacBook Pro While using a MacBook Pro, I set the keyboard to US and Unicode.\nWhen I try inputting a Unicode set holding down Opt, I only get 4 separate characters.

I recently got a new scanner (Epson RR-600W) that claims compatibility with Image Capture on macOS 13, but when I look at its binary, it has only Intel architectures:\n$ file /Library/Image\\ Capture/Devices/EPSON\\ Scanner.app/Contents/MacOS/EPSON\\ Scanner \n/Library/Image Capture/Devices/EPSON Scanner.app/Contents/MacOS/EPSON Scanner: Mach-O universal binary with 2 architectures: [x86_64:Mach-O 64-bit executable x86_64] [i386:\n- Mach-O executable i386]\n/Library/Image Capture/Devices/EPSON Scanner.app/Contents/MacOS/EPSON Scanner (for architecture x86_64):    Mach-O 64-bit executable x86_64\n/Library/Image Capture/Devices/EPSON Scanner.app/Contents/MacOS/EPSON Scanner (for architecture i386):  Mach-O executable i386\n\nI'm pretty sure kernel extensions must be arm64, but I don't know if Image Capture drivers are kernel extensions.\n\nA: I also have an EPSON scanner (Perfection 4990 Photo), and Image Capture works fine using the /Library/Image Capture/Devices/EPSON Scanner.app driver, even though it's an Intel process on an M1 Mac.\nThe Image Capture app itself still runs natively.\nThe latest version (as of December 2022) of the ICA driver is 5.8.12, and is available here:\nhttps://ftp.epson.com/drivers/ESICA_5.8.12.dmg\nEpson Support have told me in an email that they have 'no plans' to update the driver for Apple Silicon. (There are 579 scanner models listed in 'DeviceInfo.plist' in the driver's bundle....!!! However, the RR-600W is not in the list.)\nEpson does have its own scanning software, independent of Apple's Image Capture, of course.\n\nA: The Image Capture drivers are regular executables - they're not kernel extensions. So in theory (and most probably practice as well) they should work just fine under Rosetta 2.\n", "Q: How to record line-in on MacOS Catalina?

Is there a way, without using a Mac?\nAs a side note, Telegram is happy to allow attaching a file from the Gallery.\n\nA: One solution (out of many) could be downloading the picture to your iCloud and then selecting the \"Document\" from Whatsapp from iCloud to send a full resolution picture.\n", "Q: why does Terminal run about half speed when sleeping I frequently run simulations from Terminal that take many hours, often overnight.\nNormally I use the Caffeine menu-bar app to prevent sleeping during these runs. If I forget to do that, the job continues to run during sleep, but at about 50% of normal speed.\nDoes anyone know why that happens? My first guess was a power-saving strategy, but my laptop power adaptor is always plugged in.\nThis is not a critical problem for me, I'm just curious. Normally I disable sleeping, and if I forget, at worst I get about half as much work done overnight than I expect.\n\nA: The definition of system sleep requires the CPU to either quiesce or power off its cores. This means that no code is running during the time that the system is actually sleeping. If you are seeing progress on your computation, it means that the system is awake during that time. On Macs, there is a concept known as a dark wake, which is when everything is running except for the display and speakers, and system fans are best-effort disabled, so from an observer's perspective the system still looks like it's sleeping even though it's actually fully on. Certain high-performance subsystems will be throttled back during this time for energy and thermal reasons, so some of the tasks running during a dark wake will be slower.\nDark wakes happen for a number of reasons. You can see a record of system sleep and wake events using the pmset command:\npmset -g log\n\nIf you run this and look for the timestamps corresponding to when your system was supposed to be asleep, you are going to find a surprisingly high number of Sleep -> DarkWake -> Sleep sequences during that period. This is when your simulation makes progress.\nAll of this is expected behavior. To avoid interrupting your simulation with a bunch of sleep-wake-sleep sequences, you need to remember to use Caffeine or the caffeinate command. The latter, btw, allows you to chain your CLI invocation so that you're less likely to forget:\ncaffeinate /path/to/your/simulation/command\n\nSee caffeinate(8) for more details.\n", "Q: Reset iPad Mini v1 Not Validating I have an iPad Mini v1 that had a memory leak.

Any idea how I can unlock and mount this disk?\n\nA: On a Mac with Secure Enclave or a T2 chip, once you have exceeded the 10 attempts you will need a trip to the Apple Store with proof of ownership.\nBefore that, if you think you might have nearly remembered it & want another go, you can get 10 more attempts from Recovery.\nIf these also fail, then there are ten more attempts for FileVault recovery mode. If all 30 attempts are wrong, the Secure Enclave closes. Mac models with a T2 security chip have the option of using iCloud recovery, FileVault recovery and similar measures.\nSource: Wrong password and unlock code: You have so many attempts on Mac and iPhone!\n", "Q: How can I enable cross-OS cut-and-paste in Windows 11 with VMWare Fusion 13 on M1?

I installed VMWare Tools and they appear to be working because I now have network access inside the VM and I can adjust the resolution.\nHowever, there is no option for cross-OS cut-and-paste-- not in the Edit menu of VMWare Fusion, and not from any keyboard shortcuts I can find.  How do I enable this feature (or, if it is not available, where are the docs that say it is unsupported)?\n\nA: Based on a question in the VMWare Forums, according to the Unofficial Fusion 13 for Apple Silicon Companion (version 4, Dec. 11, 2022):\n\nCopy/paste and drag/drop does not currently work between the Mac host\nand a Windows 11ARM virtual machine. This is due to Fusion 13’s\ncurrent lack of a full VMware Tools implementation for Windows 11 ARM.\nA workaround discovered by the Fusion community is to connect to the\nvirtual machine using a RDP client such as Microsoft Remote Desktop for\nthe Mac (which does run on Apple Silicon Macs). This will allow\ncopy/paste between the Mac and the Windows virtual machine. Note\nthat this will only work on Windows 11 Pro and Enterprise editions.

I have a Mac Mini 2018 and a new monitor with a DVI cable.\nCurrently, my Mac Mini is completely reset, so I need to reinstall macOS.\nI have two problems:\n\n*\n\n*Screen is flickering and can't see anything on the screen\n\n*Seeing -1008f error while doing recovery.\n\nThe first issue can be resolved by resetting NVRAM using Cmd+Opt+P+R on boot.\nI am trying to resolve the second issue as well by booting with a USB or doing the latest Internet Recovery, however, I can't boot with any other keys than Cmd+Opt+P+R because otherwise, I can not see the screen at all.\nDoes anyone have any idea how to reset NVRAM and boot with USB at the same time?\n\nA: If after one NVRAM reset, the video is not clear you almost certainly have a hardware issue that's not likely to be resolved by the reinstallation. It's unlikely but possible the issue is with the display and not the Mac, can you try another cable / display?\nIdeally, you would take this Mac to another to do the erase / make a bootable drive and bring that already working drive to the Mac to validate that it's not software and you need service.\nI agree with the comments, the error indicates a network error getting to internet recovery so if you can't get a repair estimate easily, perhaps taking the Mac to another network to try one restore again would be worth the time.\nYou also may wish to check your AppleID online to be sure it's not activation lock causing the registration issue. If this wasn't managed by your AppleID - official service will be the only way you'll know what's the issue as they can try restore from a known good OS or a known good internet connection that works for recovery.\n\nA: I am posting an answer for everyone else experiencing a -1008F error. It was happening because the primary volume was wiped in Disk Utility.\nOnce you manage to get into Disk Utility and set up the primary volume, you will be able to install the system.\nI used DFU restore to get into Disk Utility because any other USB boot or startup disks did not work out.\nFor more information about DFU restore, see Apple's Support article \"Revive or restore a Mac with Apple silicon using Apple Configurator\".\n", "Q: Accent keys not working as expected on macOS Ventura I speak and type in Russian but occasionally I need to type some words in the Kyrgyz language. The alphabet is the same as Russian's but with three additional letters.\nUp until macOS Ventura, holding down keys о, у, н in the Russian PC input source would give me a menu with accent letters that contained needed Kyrgyz letters \"ө\", \"ү\", \"ң\". That was incredibly convenient for me because to get these letters in Kyrgyz layout you need to also hold down Opt which is very inconvenient.\nIn macOS Ventura, the behavior changed. It's not as if it completely stopped working, it started behaving as an iOS keyboard. Almost all accent keys are gone except for \"ё\" and \"ъ\".\nHow can I roll back the behavior to the old one? Having plenty of options in accent keys was incredibly convenient.\n\nA: The Monterey version of the Russian PC layout can be found here.\nBut it's not the layout but a keyboard-ru.plist in the Press and Hold app which you probably need.  You can get that here.  Whether there is any way to insert this .plist or edit the existing one in Ventura I don't know.\nApple has moved the location of this .plist in Ventura. Now it appears to be in /System/Library/TextInput/TextInput_ru.bundle/Versions/A/Resources/Keyboard-ru.plist\nIf modifying that turns out to be impractical, perhaps best to use Ukelele to add the characters you need to a custom Russian PC keyboard.\n", "Q: Can I select unselectable text in Safari? I am trying to copy and paste the dimensions of this box on the USPS website in Safari.\nFor some mysterious reason, I am unable to do so.\nIs there a way to select this text without changing browsers?\n\nA: Option 1: Use a third-party tool or take a screenshot\nI really like TextSniper (paid, $7.99) for this, and it works on any app and even inside pictures or paused videos.\nIt provides a shortcut (Cmd+Shift+2 by default) to select a region in the screen and uses OCR to copy the selected text to the clipboard.\nIt's not perfect but is accurate in 90% of cases in my experience. A little cleanup is required for the other 10%, but it's still a time-saver even then.\nAs suggested by @Alper, if you don't want to use a paid third-party tool, you can instead take a screenshot with Cmd+Shift+3, open the screenshot with Preview, and select the text there using the Live Text feature available in recent macOS versions.\n\nOption 2: Use the Web Inspector\nIf you don't want to use third-party software, you're in luck, since the text you want to copy is not part of a picture, the web developer just disabled selection. Nothing that can't be worked around, but it'll require looking under the hood a little bit.\nFirst, you will need to enable developer mode by turning on Safari > Preferences > Advanced > Show Develop menu in the menu bar.\nNow when you right-click on any portion of any web page, a new option will appear in the context menu called Inspect Element. Right-click on the un-selectable text and click on Inspect Element.\nA web developer tools panel will appear. There are many parts to it, but all you need for this is the big panel on the left with a hierarchy of items that look like <div class=..., <span class=... and so on. The underlying HTML element you right-clicked on will be selected and highlighted in blue. It looks like this:\n<span class=\"sku-id\" id=\"prodDisplaySkuSize\">11-1/4\"(L) x 8-3/4\"(W) x 6\"(H)</span>\n\nThis is called an HTML element. It has three parts: the beginning tag (<span class=\"sku-id\" id=\"prodDisplaySkuSize\">), the content (11-1/4\"(L) x 8-3/4\"(W) x 6\"(H)), and the ending tag (</span>).\nRight-click on the content and click on Copy > Text. This will copy the following to the clipboard:\n                    11-1/4\"(L) x 8-3/4\"(W) x 6\"(H)\n\nYou may need to clean up the leading whitespace depending on how you want to use this.\n\nOption 3: Re-enable text selection\nAnother option is to override the developer's decision and re-enable text selection on the web page. To do this, you'll need to enable developer mode as above by turning on Safari > Preferences > Advanced > Show Develop menu in menu bar.\nNow open the Console by selecting Develop > Show JavaScript Console or by pressing Cmd+Opt+C.\nPaste the following code into the console and press Enter:\nvar style = document.createElement('style'); style.textContent = '* { -webkit-user-select: initial !important; }'; document.body.appendChild(style)\n\nYou can now close the console using the X button at the top-left if you want.\nNow you can select and copy any text on the web page as usual. You'll need to open the console and enter the above code again if you reload or reopen the page.\n\nA: Not sure if there is a direct and easy way applicable to all such web sites so that one does not have to use a browser other than Safari in such cases.\nI think some of the easiest ways in Safari are to either save the web page in Page Source format (File->Save As), save it as a PDF file (File->Export as PDF...), or take a screenshot (press Command+Shift+3 while the web page is open) in order to use the Live Text feature in Preview.\nAfter saving the web page in either of these formats, open the saved file, find the part you are trying to select, select it with your mouse, and press Command+C to copy it. Depending on the web site, either of these three methods may or may not work which means you may have to try one after another until you get a satisfactory result.\nAs long as the text to be selected is not part of a picture or a video, I think the surest way is to use the Developer tools in Safari but this method is less straightforward than the three already mentioned.\nTo use the Developer tools, if not already enabled, you need to enable the Develop menu in Safari by getting into Safari->Settings, clicking Advanced, and then selecting “Show Develop menu in menu bar”. Once enabled, right click on the text you wish to copy, select \"Inspect Element\", right click on the highlighted part of the HTML code that will appear, select Copy and then choose Text or HTML. I am pasting below the screenshot of an example for this last method.\n\n\nA: No, there is no way because it is not text—it is pixels in an image.  When I've been faced with something like that, I copy the image, crop it down to just the text in GraphicConverter, increase the contrast with GraphicConverter, then convert to text with Cisdem OCR.\nBut I'd never go through all that for something so small.  I'd just type it out:\n6\"  8¾\"  11¼\"\n\nBy the way, you can copy what I just typed.  :-)\nEDIT: After writing that, I noticed that the same dimensions do appear as text to the right of the image.  I was able to copy and paste that as follows: on menu, View→Show Reader, then in the simplified Reader view, the text can be selected and copied.\n", "Q: Shortcut to open dialog to insert icon When I google this I can't find it.

About once per day usually when I am actively streaming something like Netflix or gaming, I will abruptly lose my connection to the internet. The WiFi router is inches from my computer and the signal always remains strong.

My grep -l did not find it because it is now binary format.  But it is not in the same path as in previous O.S. versions.  Now in /System/Library/TextInput/TextInput_en.bundle/Versions/A/Resources/Keyboard-en.plist which is read-only.

It's definitely valuable to know the new location you have discovered for Ventura.\nUnfortunately Apple has made it increasingly difficult to modify these files.\nAs far as I know, there's no way have to have the accent menu of a keyboard layout reflect anything other than one of the language specific .plists located in System/Library.  Normally which accent menu a keyboard uses depends on the language code specified in its .bundle format.\n\nA: For now, I'll have to say the same as Tom: \"As far as I know, there's no way.\"  I succeeded in an earlier version by the proctalgic method of rebooting to disable SIP, installing my change, and rebooting with SIP re-enabled.  But soon after, a Software Update reversed my change.  Not to mention how many times Apple has changed the location of the files.\nAnd now, according to the article Tom cited, doing it the first time will break the whole system.\nPutting my version of the file in /Library didn't work then and doesn't work now.  The /System file will still define the pop-ups.  I was able to use sudo & rsync to duplicate /System/Library/TextInput as /Library/TextInput, convert the file to xml, edit, and convert back.

I know how to extract text from images using preview.app, however I would like to use this feature from terminal to extract all the text from a bunch of images.\nI tried this using this method to apply same operation to multiple images but it doesn't work (it select text from only one image at time).\nI also tried converting the images into one pdf, but the text selection doesn't work anymore.\nI found no macOS apps or utilities I could use for extract the text from my image(s) from terminal.\nRight now I used the proprietary Apple's text recognition machine learning new capabilities (on macOS and iOS, here it's explained how to use their Vision framework).\nAny idea?\n\nA: In terminal:\nbrew install tesseract <- this installs the program you need (I assume that you have brew installed, if not, go to this website: https://brew.sh/).\nFor one image you do this: tesseract my.png textfile\nAnd you get a textfile.txt from that image. It should work with other image formats as well.\nIn order to loop over all images in some directory, you can do this:\nfor x in ~/Desktop/*.png; do\n    tesseract ${x} ${x} \ndone\n\nIn this case I am looping over all the png images on my Desktop and creating a .txt file for each one of them.\nIf you want more formats you can specify them like so:\n~Desktop/(*.png|*.jpeg|*.jpg|*.bmp)\n", "Q: How to create an Apple ID?

First, there is no phone number area code, and more importantly there is no box to enter such a code.\nSo simple question: How do I create an AppleID?\n\n\nA: If it doesn't work during the setup process of your Mac, you can also go to https://appleid.apple.com, create a new AppleID there and then use it during the setup of the Mac.\n", "Q: Home folder not shown in \"Finder\" I am trying to setup a MacBook Air I bought from work, and I noticed that my home folder\n/Users/alex\n\nis not shown in \"Finder\":\n\nWhat the heck is going on? Why is my hole folder not shown in \"Finder\", and how to fix this bug?\n\nA: Something seems very wrong with this installation. You claim your company's IT department installed it today -- I would suggest that they've done something very strange.\nI strongly recommend erasing and reinstalling the OS. Apple Support pages for erasing and reinstalling the OS are here:\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/mac-help/mchl7676b710/13.0/mac/13.0\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/mac-help/mchlp1599/13.0/mac/13.0\n", "Q: npm and git is very slow in some folders In most places inside my home directory, npm install and git clone runs very slow, but not in ~/Library. npm install takes tens of minutes in reify stage. While git does not take that long, it takes many times more than in normal folders especially in resolve delta stage.\nThe most weird thing is that it performs normally in some folders but becomes extremely slow when run in other folders.\nSlow folders include ~/Downloads, ~/Desktop, /opt, and ~/repos I created, and normal folders include ~/Library, /tmp, `mktemp -d` and right inside /usr/local.\nI tested multiple times in those folders, but the result was the same. It always runs slow in slow folders and always normal in normal folders.\nWhen I first installed the node, there was no problem installing packages or pulling git repo, but after some days, maybe after I installed docker, that weird thing started to happen.\nIs there anything that I can try to make npm and git faster everywhere?\nI suspect that some antivirus is making file write slow, but I have no third-party antivirus installed. If the builtin antivirus system is causing this problem, I want to exclude some folders or completely disable it.\nI have plenty of storage space and it has about 100% of free space.\nMemory space might be tight but it cannot explain why it's not slow in some folders.\nI have tried granting Full Disk Access to Terminal app, but everything was the same.\nnode v16.18.2 installed by nvm\nnpm v8.19.2\nMacBook M1 Pro bought days ago\nMonterey (not upgrading to Ventura for reasons)\n\nA: I just found that Microsoft Defender was installed when I was not noticing, and it was the problem.\nI uninstalled it and everything's fine now.\n", "Q: Why does even `rm` refuse to operate with insufficient disk space, and how do you *really* delete files in that situation? I have macOS High Sierra - 10.13.6 Security Update 2020-006 (17G14042) and my system is not behaving well due to the disk being full of data.\nI try to keep a few GB free on my Mac's HD but occasionally it suddenly gets full for reasons beyond my control (some swap file randomly gets larger perhaps?). Then the system deadlocks - files cannot be saved, the Finder becomes unresponsive (even when force-relaunched), some other applications become unresponsive, and some of the ones that do respond are unable to quit cleanly (presumably because that would involve writing to files).  I'd like to save my unsaved work by first clearing disk space without having to hold down the power key.\nThe first thing I do is force-quit browsers but that alone doesn't solve it. I typically still have Terminal open and am able to switch to it. There, using df and du I can see that maybe 1-2G could be freed from ~/Library/Cache or ~/Downloads.   However, when I try to remove files using rm, e.g.:\nrm -rf ~/Library/Cache/Google\n\nor:\nrm -f ~/Downloads/biggest_single_file.blob\n\n...then the rm utility itself refuses, with the message \"No space left on device\".  To me this is surprising - why would a utility whose sole purpose in life is to remove files need to consume disk space? It's like saying \"You're too thirsty to drink,\" or \"Let's not turn on the heater, it's too cold,\" - in other words, ridiculous.\nI'm guessing the explanation must be that rm, even though I've been thinking of it as a low-level utility, is really doing something more complicated involving versioning or backups or journaling or something that requires a file to be created. If so: is there an even-lower-level command for truly just deleting files?\nUpdate: I guess whatever over-clever thing is consuming disk space must actually be a property of the filesystem rather than necessarily the rm utility.  I got the same error message if I tried\necho \"\" > ~/Downloads/biggest_single_file.blob\n\nor\npython -c \"open('$HOME/Downloads/biggest_single_file.blob','wt')\"\n\n\nA: A couple things - there is no more low level item, and being on High Sierra you could have APFS and you could have HFS+ filesystem. Both will behave poorly when there is no room for more file data since both systems use data space to contain large directory and metadata. Regardless of which of the two you have, I would recommend these tasks:\n\n*\n\n*Get an external drive and install a bootable OS onto it so you can make major changes / nurse the internal drive back to health.\n\n*Look at backups - if you have a backup that you trust you could delete the entire user folder - make a new admin user - then fix the filesystem or know you just need to erase / reinstall / move less data back.\n\n*Keeping \"a few GB free\" isn't a good plan on macOS  - you want 10 or more free ideally. Use an external drive to home the user profile or move large items like music / photos / videos or large applications to the external drive so the boot drive can have plenty of free space.\n\n*Get a tool like Daisy Disk to help you with disk space discovery if the native tools don't help.\n\nOnly if you have APFS - look at snapshots, but I believe that came in a newer OS than yours, but disk utility should show you if there are any snapshots as can command line items. You have a system that's not working (you know this) if a rm (or sudo rm) in the user home folder doesn't clear space. Try to boot to another OS that's healthy and then repeat your cleaning - your system might not be healthy enough to fix itself. Be sure to run fsck or Disk Utility to repair the drive once you clean space (or once before you clean, then clean, then once again to be sure it's ready to try to run - perhaps after re-applying the last combo updater to be sure the key parts of the system are still correct).\n", "Q: logic remote IPad for 10.4.8 I use logic 10.4.8 and I need the right version of logic remote for my IPad Air 2.\nWhich version do I have to use and where can I get it?\n\nA: Logic Remote is not qualified to run with Logic 10.4.8, though some people say  it partially works.\nThe Apple Store will only offer you the latest version of Logic Remote that will run on your iPad.

I opened the on-screen keyboard in System Preferences->Accessibility and pressed escape, and it does register the keystroke.\n\nA: After trying a few things and reading around, it turned out that Siri was somehow to blame. I had also noticed lately that Siri had stopped working, it didn't trigger by voice or clicking the dock icon. After disabling and re-enabling Siri in System Preferences, the escape key immediately started working properly.\n", "Q: Is it possible to upgrade OS X version 10.5.8 to macOS 13 (latest version)? I have a Mac computer I haven't used for a long time and I want to upgrade to the latest version. Is it possible? If so how?\n\nA: You don't really need the latest version\nYou've already heard the bad news - you can't get the latest version.\nBy the way, you can't run Windows 10 on a 2006 PC either.\nBut you also don't need the latest version.  Your Mac can be functional at previous versions.  Apple will still let you download older versions of the OS.\nUse resources on the web to determine the latest OS your system can support. Some people are skittish about running the latest version because they worry it'll bog their system; see the last 3 paragraphs for answers on that.\nEl Capitan (10.11) is a particular \"version sweet-spot\".  Apple made a point to have it support most of the early Intel-based machines (many owners had gotten unusually short useful lives out of their prior Mac due to the Intel switch, so Apple wanted them to have  unusually long lives out of their first Intel Mac).\nAnd OS X 10.11 is perfectly usable; notably its web browser will support TLS 1.2, so it works properly with Web sites.\nYou will have to be careful with iOS versions on your mobile devices, however. Each iOS version has limits on how much it will interact with older systems. They generally will talk to even a 2005 iPhoto/Photos, however the ability to sync with iTunes will vary. So decline iOS major-version updates until you have confirmed through research that the iOS version will play with your MacOS version.\nPowerPC apps and 10.5\nIf you have any PowerPC applications that rely on Rosetta to function on your Mac, any upgrade beyond 10.6 will break Rosetta and those apps will be dead as a stone.  To solve this problem, I recommend before you upgrade using CarbonCopyCloner to copy your entire hard drive out to an external USB keyfob, so you can boot back into 10.5 by holding down \"option\" while starting up.\nMaybe change your hard drive too?\nHere's food for thought - depending on how easy this is on your system.  (Mini: pretty easy, iMac: PITA).  You might just keep your internal hard drive exactly the way it is, mount it in an external hard drive chassis, and then install an internal SSD kit. The SSD will run dramatically faster, because all data is instant access - no long latency as hard drives have.  It will feel like a new machine.\nIt's a lot easier to buy a USB keyfob drive and use it as your primary hard drive. Really.  Keep it in an internal USB port - don't put it out on a USB hub.  If you can find a FireWire SSD then all the better.\nUSB doesn't have a burst speed as fast as an internal hard drive, but the \"zero seek time\" thing more than makes up for it, boy howdy and then some.\nOlder Apple systems can boot from any drive, and will permanently boot from an external drive just as easily as from internal.  (the newest systems see some interference from the T2 security chip, at the very least you have to disable much of its benefits.)\n\nA: The newest Mac that can run Leopard 10.5.8 was released in 2009. Macs of that era can probably run El Capitan (10.11) at best, see How can I download an older version of OS X/macOS? for installation instructions.\nWhile that will certainly be an improvement in terms of compatibility with more recent software, web standards and other technologies, it's still likely that the latest versions of software won't run on that (six-year-old) OS.\nEither way, you're looking at 'retro-computing', and will have to seek out versions of third-party apps that are contemporary and compatible with your OS.\n\nA: No Mac compatible with OS X 10.5.8 (Leopard) is also compatible with macOS 13 (Ventura).\n\nNote: You can goto EveryMac.com to determine which versions of OS X and macOS are compatible with your Mac.\n\nAccording to the Apple website macOS Ventura is compatible with these computers, Macs older than the 2017 models are not macOS 13 (Ventura) compatible.\nUsing dates from the Wikipedia article macOS, one can determine Macs newer than the 2009 models are not OS X 10.5.8 (Leopard) compatible.\nSo basically all 2010 through 2016 Macs are not compatible with either Leopard or Ventura.\nFor instructions on upgrading to the latest version compatible with your Mac, your should include information that can help identify your Mac model and year. According to Apple, you could have a Mac computer with an Intel, PowerPC G5, or PowerPC G4 (867MHz or faster) processor.\nI should also include a reference to How can I download an older version of OS X/macOS?.\n\nA: This actually is possible although not officially supported so its not 100% guranteed to work. Dortainas Opencore has a project \"Legacy Patcher\" https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Legacy-Patcher/\nIt will require you to read the instructions carefully, I did this for a friend a few weeks back and it worked very well.\nIt is possible as your mac is very old that you cant run the latest and greatest but you should be able to get a recent enough version, much newer than what is \"approved\" by apple that you can use modern applications on, make sure you read the hardware list of what models can run which versions.\nAlthough keep your expectations low as 15 - 20 year old computers will struggle with lots of modern tasks and apps.\n\nA: If you start in recovery mode with ALT + Command + R your device will check automatically with Apple-Servers the latest possible macOS fitting on your machine. If you have a backup you can erase the HD with the Disk Utility and install the suggested OS.\n", "Q: Remap caps lock in macOS Ventura There used to be an easy way to remap caps lock to escape in older versions, and in fact that setting remained for the keyboards I had used prior to upgrading to Ventura.

Does the IMac not see  the Fusion drive? ( i can't upload pictures here?..)\n\nA: A Fusion drive is simply software that presents two separate devices (a small SSD and a large HDD) as one disk volume.\nHowever, it is possible for the drives to become 'split' as their separate components.\nIt sounds like your Fusion drive was split -- either when you erased and reinstalled after the crash; or possibly if the SSD failed. Do you not see the smaller SSD volume shown anywhere?\nIt's more usual for the mechanical hard drive to fail -- and I would be concerned about the reliability of a 7-year-old hard drive.\nMy advice is to get a large external USB SSD, and use that instead.\n\nA: Before restoring, you needed to fix your split Fusion Drive.

I only upgraded to Monterey because I wanted to run an app that wouldn't run on Catalina.\nI deleted ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.Automator.* — some five .plist and three .lockfile files — and it still crashes.

0x000000010cff952e start + 462\n\n\nA: The normal procedure for something like this after an update is to determine if the issue is with the system or with something in your user’s account.  Starting up in safe mode and/or creating a new user account should give you a starting point.\nIf the system works normally in safe mode, look for incompatible extensions, fonts, plugins, launch agents/daemons, etc and remove or update them (note that current OS versions have a sealed read-only system partition, but if SIP has been disabled by a custom installer or a hack, who knows).  If everything works from a new account, look for user preferences, login items, etc - things that may have been left over from earlier versions.\nFor Automator, specific areas to look at would be in the user’s library in Application Support (the Automator folder there is normally used for variables, information about action usage and installation, etc), Automator (items in this folder are third party actions that have been installed by the user - note that Automator will try to load these actions when it starts up), Caches, Preferences, Services, and Workflows.  Look for incompatible or out-of-date items; sometimes older workflows will need to be rebuilt to use updated actions.  If you don’t care about earlier items just remove or delete them - Automator will recreate files that it uses, such as preferences.\n", "Q: Create a link from one directory to another I have two accounts on the same Mac.\nThe first account has two directories myScripts and downloads that I want to use from the second account. myScripts is on the environment path, so I can run the scripts there from any place.\nHow do I create links from these directories in the first account to the second one in a way they work like they do in the first account? I understand that the second account still has a downloads directory by default and that the link may have to be renamed to another thing.\nAlso, do I have to change the permissions on the files in the first account?\n\nA: So you have user A and user B both with a myScripts directory and want to run scripts from the directory of user B while being logged in as user A? For this you don't need to create any link, you simply can add the directory to your path by adding the following to the shell startup file of user A:\nexport PATH=\"/Users/UserB/myscripts:$PATH\"\n\nTo create a link you can run (as user A)\nln -s /Users/UserB/Downloads ~/Downloads-of-B\n\nIn both cases, you need to change permissions by logging in as user B and running\nchmod go+rx ~/Downloads ~/myScripts\n\nPS: Having said that: I find it easier to install my scripts into /usr/local/bin so they are available to all user accounts automatically.\n", "Q: How to move ALL windows from external display to the main laptop display? Is there a simple keyboard shortcut, or setting to enable a shortcut, or anything, that. would allow me to quickly move ALL open windows from the external display to the main laptop display?\nThe problem is that frequently, I need to plug the laptop for a presentation or a class and I have a bunch of windows on the external display that shouldn't be there. So I'd prefer it doesn't remember which windows were in the external display from work, and just assume I want all windows to start in the main display only!\n\nA: There's no built-in command to move windows from Space to Space.\nAs you use 'Displays have separate Spaces', then set up one additional space & leave it empty.\nIf you didn't have it switched on, any windows on the 2nd screen would all drop back to the primary each time you unplug the secondary [and would not automatically return when you re-connect].\n", "Q: The perfect app for customizing a 5button mouse? I'm a new Mac user but I still struggle with ideal mouse settings for a common 5button mouse (I use Logitech MX500 with horizontal scroll and a small travel Razer). I need something from Logi Options, Karabiner Elements, Mos, BetterMouse etc., but it can't be well combined together. I'm willing to pay a lifetime license.\nWhat should this perfect app do:\n\n*\n\n*Back and Forward buttons working as Back and Forward in most of the apps (Chrome, Finder, ...).\n\n*Scroll acceleration (smooth scrolling).\n\n*Physical horizontal scroll working.\n\n*Doing a horizontal scroll with a modifier key + normal scroll.\n\n*Zoom with modifier key + scroll (ideally not the Accessibility feature, but Cmd +/- key)\n\n*Custom keymapping for different apps (like Commander One which doesn't support Back & Forward button)\n\n*Ideally a modifier to make the scroll slower/faster.\n\nKarabiner Elements may do much of if, but the mouse lags during a fast move. It's a reported bug which hasn't been fixed for perhaps a year. BetterMouse can do it except custom behavior in specified apps as well as Mos. Logi options can't do other things.\nThanks!\n\nA: SteerMouse will do all this - not sure about the horizontal scroll, never come across it before as a dedicated feature except in the Apple Magic mice, which I don't use.\nNormal scroll + Shift is Mac-standard to do a horizontal scroll.\nAlso not sure about the zoom. You can set chord combos so you may be able to press that into service.  iirc there's a free trial so you can test this kind of thing.\nI had an MX518, similar as far as I can tell to the MX500 & SteerMouse served me well for a decade. It doesn't do so well on the MX Master series as Logitech have added some odd firmware which doesn't advertise itself very well to the OS.\n\nA: I'm happily using Mac Mouse Fix for some years which can assign actions to Mouse buttons and also greatly improves scrolling smoothness. Horizontal scrolling and zooming via modifier key are standard on macOS AFAIK, but definitely work with this app. However, keymappings for different apps is not supported. Free and open-source.\nFor maximum configurability, I'd recommend BetterTouchTool. Originally intended to improve built-in and magic trackpads, it now also extensively supports mouse and keyboard settings and should also be able to do different mappings for different apps. Lifetime license available.\n", "Q: iPad: How to write on sticky notes with Pencil in Freeform Im currently trying out freeform and was surprised to find out that I can not write anything with my Pencil on sticky notes. I can add text to sticky notes the usual ways, but anything writen with Apple Pencil is not attached to the sticky note. I.e. if I move the sticky note my writen text doenst move along with it.\nAm I missing something?\n\nA: You are right. The only way I found to attach drawings is from Mac. It is possible to group the note and the drawings. Of course this cannot be consider a workaround since the grouping does not have any effect on the board open from iPad.\n", "Q: Two copies of iMovie app: can't get rid of the one \"Installing\" from the LaunchPad (other working from Finder) I have the following situation:\n\n*\n\n*In application Folder\n\n\n\n*\n\n*LaunchPad (stuck here ever since)\n\n\nI found similar problems, such as:\n\n*\n\n*iMovie update stuck with phantom app\n\n*Mac App Store update stuck (Installing - Calculating...)\n, but none for MacOS Ventura (13.1), none worked. Please leave your input to rectify this, thanks \nEDIT 2: Now there's a XCode.app update but it's stuck at \"Waiting...\". Looks like I'm in trouble cause it won't move to any other App Store update unless this is fixed, I think \n\nA: Okay it's fixed now at last .

I'd like to be able create/read boards in the new app freeform which is included with iPadOS and iOS 16.2 for collaboration.\nIs this API provided by Apple or a third party tool?\n\nA: The Freeform app does not provide an AppleScript dictionary, nor any Siri Shortcuts.\nTherefore the only programatic control is through UI scripting:\n\n*\n\n*Automating the User Interface - Mac Automation Scripting Guide\nFor example, to create a new board from the command-line using applescript UI scripting:\nosascript -e 'tell application \"Freeform\" to activate' \\\n    -e 'tell application \"System Events\" to tell process \"Freeform\" to click menu item \"New Board\" of menu 1 of menu bar item \"File\" of menu bar 1'\n\n", "Q: Icon for SMB Volume, but not NFS?

From the command line, things are fine and work as expected.\nHowever, on my Desktop, the custom icons I had for the shares/volumes are gone (replaced with the default), and I can't seem to put them back using the technique outlined here, for example.\nI've tried ICNS & PNG files, and these worked just fine with SMB (and still do).\nAre custom Volume icons not supported for NFS?  Or am I just doing something wrong?\n\nA: I don't have Ventura installed, but these instructions seem to work on my version of macOS (High Sierra):\nChange icons for files or folders on Mac\nWhich is also given as the answer to the following questions:\n\n*\n\n*How can I change the icon of Recent Folder that I drag to dock on Mac\n\n*How to change the recent files smart folder icon in the dock?\nThis would probably make your question a duplicate.\nThe instructions posted in you link do not seem to work well and might be outdated.\n", "Q: OpenLDAP configuration via terminal on MacOS 12 and above (Monterey and Ventura) I want to make Mac machines, in my network, use my LDAP Server to authenticate users. To do so, I tried the GUI tool \"Directory Utility\" and configured everything as desired and took a copy of following files which were created/modified after the attributes mappings and LDAP configuration:\n/Library/Preferences/OpenDirectory/Configurations/Contacts.plist\n/Library/Preferences/OpenDirectory/Configurations/Search.plist\n/Library/Preferences/OpenDirectory/Configurations/LDAPv3/ldapserver.mycompany.com.plist\n\nNow I want to deploy these files to the other Mac machines through Puppet to configure all of Mac machines to do the authentication process via the Ldap Server.\nBut the problem is I do not have permission to write into those paths (even as a root). Apparently (I guess) the paths can be written through tools like Directory Utility (and maybe dscl).\nI used to use this approach before Big Sur and it was working perfectly fine but now I can't get it work.\nI need a way to configure this through terminal so I can automate (puppetise) the process. I googled it a lot but the only useful thing was dscl command which does not sound like it can be used to configure an LDAP node.\nI'm completely open to any other way to configure this and the only requirement is that it should be done through terminal.\nIn another sense, is there any equivalent command-line utility for Directory Utility GUI?\n\nA: You can configure LDAP with a profile. Create a Configuration Profile using Apple Configurator with an LDAP configuration payload. This gives you a .mobileconfig file.\n\nIf you don't have an MDM solution to deploy this, it appears you can no longer use a Puppet module like edestecd-mobileconfig_profile to apply profiles since Big Sur.\nThe profile -I install option has been removed in Big Sur and the Puppet module vanagandr42-mac_profile notes that it no longer works in Big Sur and later.\nThis means you will need to use an MDM solution to deploy the configuration profile automatically. For example, Apple Business Essentials.\n", "Q: How to create a link to python3 on MacOS? Running MacOS 13.1 (Ventura) I see that python3 is installed in /usr/bin, which I can call by running python3. However, I also want to run python3 by just calling python, so I changed to the folder /usr/bin and run the command\nsudo ln -s python3 python\n\nwhich ended in the error\nln: python: Operation not permitted\n\nMaybe I need more than root rights, or what weird Mac thing is going on?\nHowever, what to do to link python to python3?\n\nA: Basically you cannot.\nThe simplest solution is to create an alias for python. In you ~/.zprofile file add\nalias python='/usr/bin/python3'\n\nThis means that when you type python you get python3. However you can't run a python script with #! /usr/bin/env python as the first line, which I think is good as you should make that explicitly python3.\nHowever if you are using python heavily then the general opinion is not to use Apple's python but to install it from elsewhere. I would recommend from conda (or pay for anaconda if doing this professionally) or from python.org. Alternatively via a package manager e.g. MacPorts, Homebrew nix.\nThe reason you cannot change or add things in /usr/bin in modern version of macOS is that Apple puts most of the system onto a separate volume that cannot be written to and to enforce that it also checks that it has not been altered.\n", "Q: Terminal on Mac stopped launching after upgrade to Catalina It was so nice so far working with bash until my laptop got upgraded to Catalina and now Terminal does not launch at all.\nAny hints?

If I view this page, the page is blank.  If I move my mouse around on it, elements bits and pieces of the elements appear.\nIt started happening for me macOS 13.01, but is still present in 13.1.  I notice that Mozilla and Chrome are fine, but Orion has the same bug.  WebKit seems to be the common thing between Safari and Orion, but I haven't found any issues listed anywhere, for Safari, Orion, or WebKit.\nAnother weird fact is that, as soon as I focus on another window, all of the elements on the page render entirely, but as soon as I focus back on the page, they a disappear.\nUpdate\nI'm using a Studio Display and the issue seems to be there when Safari is using the entirety of the Studio Display.  As soon as I shrink the browser down to fit on the 16 inch display of my MacBook, it goes away.  When I move that shrunken version over to the Studio Display, the issue isn't there.  When I expand the width of the browser to fit the width of the Studio Display, the issue isn't there.  When I expand the height of the browser to fit the height of the Studio Display, the issue occurs.\n\n\nA: Rendering issues are not always easy to tackle. Things you may want to try:\n\n*\n\n*remove any data cached for that site (Safari -> Settings -> Privacy -> Manage Website Data...)\n\n*disable any Safari extensions (and, assuming it works, enable them one by one until it fails again)\n\n*create a new user account on your Mac and access the site from there to have a point of reference\n\n", "Q: Can/How to delete Apple Shared Support zip file?

Running Ventura 13.0.1 on a Macbook Pro 2019 (Intel)\nOccasionally--several times a day, at what seem like random times--MacOS gets into a temporary state in which it seems to get stuck launching new processes.  That is, the symptoms are:\n\n*\n\n*Already running apps & desktop still seem to mostly work; I can interact, move windows around, open menus, etc.\n\n*Entering a command in a shell freezes the shell\n\n*Opening a new tab in a browser freezes the browser\n\n*Trying to open a new app from LaunchBar freezes LaunchBar\n\n*After some amount of time (typically 1-2 minutes), it unfreezes and all the queued up things launch: browser tab loads, shell command runs, etc. And then everything works normally... until the next time.\n\nI.e. it seems to me that when a process tries to launch a child process, the fork() syscall hangs for a while, and in the meantime the parent process is blocked and so unresponsive. If so, it seems like there could be some sort of resource lock/deadlock in the kernel that needs to time out? Of course I could be way off base on all this, maybe something else is going on.\nI haven't noticed any pattern for what triggers this.  It only started happening after I updated to Ventura -- post hoc ergo procter hoc?  I've tried the obvious coarse hammers: rebooting, resetting PRAM & SMC.   I don't see anything in the Console logs.\nAny ideas for what might be happening? How to debug it?  And of course how to fix it? :)\nUpdate:  It just happened again, I could pull down iStat menus while new processes were stuck.  More things I found:\n\n*\n\n*During the stuck time, kernel_task bopped up and down between 20% and 92% CPU; after the stuck time, kernel_task is back down around 3%.   RTProtectionDaemon was also bouncing up to 100% and back down, but it does that also when not in the stuck time.  No other CPU activity of note.\n\n*Answering @mmmmmm's comment:  Memory pressure 10%, Memory 55%.   No sign of any process swapping hog.\n\nUpdate 2. Maybe starting a process actually isn't the (only) problem?  It just stuck, I happened to have TextEdit running with now window.  I created a new window, wrote some text, and when I tried to save, TextEdit froze too.    So maybe the problem does have to do with file access as per @Bruce Van Allen's comment?  Or maybe it's just that once the kernel has gotten stuck starting a process, it also then blocked from writing a file?\nUpdate 3. I tried reinstalling Ventura in recovery mode.  No difference.   Continued evidence that it happens spontaneously rather than in response to something I do: this morning I sat down at the computer after not having touched it all night, tried to open a browser and it immediately wedged for 2 minutes.\nUpdate 4. As per @pion's answer https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/452740/119397 I set up spindump paused in lldb (first disabling System Integrity Protection).

You can then add them back in one by one until you've identified the culprit. Problem solved.\n\n*If the problem does persist, it's either a problem with fonts you've installed yourself or with a 3rd party kernel extension. A little more info below:\n\nFonts:- You can remove any of the fonts you've installed yourself to see if this makes a difference.\nKernel Extensions:- You can open Terminal (found within your Utilites folder) and enter the following command:\nkextstat | grep -v com.apple\nThe above command will list 3rd party kernel extensions (you may need to stretch the Terminal window so it's easier to read). Look for anything you don't remember installing, or something that belongs to software you've removed, or just anything that looks out of place. Remember though, this is a list of 3rd party kernel extensions and therefore any of them could be causing the problem.\n\nA: A pause during process spawn suggests that a critical thread is blocked on a resource. We can take a direct approach to see what gets blocked. One way to do this is by enabling kernel symbolication and running spindump during a stall. However, a complication arises because spindump is, itself, a new command, and will not be able to run during the stall period. So we have to be a little clever. One workaround is to launch spindump from within lldb and pause it at the program entry point, then resume once the stall occurs.\nHere is the full procedure:\n\n*\n\n*Make sure that the Xcode developer tools are installed and that you've also run the developer command-line tools installer. (Run lldb in Terminal to confirm.)\n\n\n*Run the following Terminal command to enable kernel symbolication:\n sudo nvram boot-args=\"keepsyms=1\"\n\nMake sure to copy-paste this so that you're entering straight quotes rather than curly/“smart” quotes. (If you get a general error, you will first need to disable System Integrity Protection. You can re-enable it after you're done with this investigation.)\n\n\n*Reboot your machine in order for the symbolication boot-arg to take effect.\n\n\n*In Terminal, run: sudo lldb spindump -- -noTarget 30 10 -reveal -noProcessingWhileSampling\n\n\n*After entering your admin password and giving a moment for dynamic library loading, you'll be at the (lldb) prompt. Enter the following: process launch -s\n\n\n*spindump is now launched but halted. Continue using your machine as normal. As soon as you begin to feel a stall, go to the Terminal window where you have your (lldb) prompt and run the c command (that is, press the c key followed by Return) so that spindump resumes execution. Do not do anything else on the computer while it's running, otherwise you will distort the data collection.\n\n\n*After waiting for >30 seconds to collect a sample and another minute or two to symbolicate and format, you’ll get a file in /tmp/spindump.txt that contains a stackshot of every process.\n\n\n*Upload the file to PasteBin or some equivalent place and add the link to it to your original question. We can take a look at it and come up with next steps for the investigation.\n\nA: For several years now, my primary system (MBP 2015 running latest available) has bogged down at random times. It's also happening on a 2019 iMac from time to time.\nAfter lots of hair pulling and general \"what the hell is going on here?\" questions, I looked at Activity Monitor and saw that remindd was really going nuts. So, I force quit. System was back to normal. I don't know why that daemon is out of whack, but it is. Sometimes I have to quit the daemon a few times a day.\nI've tried to figure out why.

While reviewing my apps running in background on my M1 MacOS Ventura 13.1 I saw that /bin/ln has \"run in background\" switched on. Why? Does /bin/ln need this? Moreover, Mac says \"this comes from unidentified developer\". Should I be worried that this is some kind of malware? I've tried to compare md5 checksum (f95cbde002ce4816e01c64511f3897b7), but I can't find the original one online or locally? The folder is not backed up automatically in Time Machine.

I’ve just migrated from Android to iPhone and transferred my WhatsApp backup. The app on the iPhone 14 pro works fine, no issues. However, when I try to link to WhatsApp web, that doesn’t work (the website is stuck on loading chat page). Also, most of the times but not always, the iPhone app crashes when doing that and the only way to recover it is to uninstall and re install the app (very annoying!). I’ve tried the followings in all sort of different combinations:\n\n*\n\n*Reboot phone and laptop\n\n*Use different web browser\n\n*Use different laptop\n\n*Use WhatsApp desktop app\n\nIt is definitely related to the iPhone app as it used to work fine on the Android one. Anyone has any idea what else I can try? I am running iOS 16.1.1 and WhatsApp 22.24.81 (latest release).\n\nA: You should file a bug report from Whatsapp > Settings > Help > Contact us.\nFor a quick solution I would suggest you to log out of WhatsApp, quit App Store to remove it's cache, reinstall Whatsapp and log in again. I would also suggest you upgrading to iOS 16.2 although it's unlikely that update will bring us any closer to a solution.\n\nA: Turns out the issue was related to the backup. If I reset the phone to factory and reinstall WhatsApp with the same backup, the same issue would show up. If I reinstalled WhatsApp with no backup, it would work ok.\nThe backup was done using a third party solution from iToolab (for which I had to subscribe). If I did the backup again using the WhatsApp recommended method (i.e. use the app 'move to iOS'), WhatsApp Web works ok on the iPhone.\nMight be a peculiar case but I thought I would answer to my question in case people encounter the same problem in the future.\n", "Q: Watch apple tv on someone else's device I purchased some media content (not a subscription) in the Apple TV app, using my iPhone.

But when I grab a single photo, it copies the whole content of the \"Event\" on the timeline.\nSo how can I select a single photo to drag that single photo to the timeline?\n\nA: Solution: Just select some photos together (Click and Shift-Click) which unselects the whole collection of photos in the \"Event\".\nThen you also can select a single photo (not shown as \"marked\" anymore) and you can drag that single photo to the timeline.\nTypical iMovie: The opposite of intuitive...\n", "Q: How is HEIC image decoding very fast in iOS? I used libheic c++ library to decode heic image files, but it is extremely slow. It takes about 1 - 2 seconds to decode an image. Same is the case in windows photo viewer too. But how can I swipe hundreds of heic photos instantaneously on the iphone photo viewer?\n\nA: I'm going to assume you mean \"libheif\" where you wrote \"libheic\" (the former is a popular library for decoding HEIC files, whereas the latter is not something that can be found anywhere).\nThere are several reasons why the built-in iOS photo viewer is fast whereas your own libheif-based decoder is slow:\n\n*\n\n*iOS devices with an A10 or newer CPU (i.e. iPhone 7 and newer) has hardware decoding built-in. This means that software taking advantage of that feature can do hardware accelerated image decoding - which is generally much faster than purely CPU-based image decoding.\n\n\n*Apple engineers spent a lot of time and effort optimising the software for decoding HEIC-files as they are widely used throughout the iOS system. This includes making it very easy for app developers (first or third party) to take advantage of hardware accelerated decoding.\n\n\n*You might not have compiled libheif and its dependencies in the most efficient matter, or have used the most efficient parameters during runtime of your program. I.e. which options you use when compiling the program can make a huge difference in performance.\nlibheif uses libde265 for actually decoding the HEIC image data. libde265 does not support the Apple A or M series hardware accelerated decoding features. It does support the more general SSE acceleration (on x86 CPUs, when enabled) however.\n\n\n*libheif is not known for being \"super fast\". I don't think it is the intention that libheif is \"the speediest option\" - rather it seems to be focused on supporting a large range of features, ease of use and making it work with a large range of programming languages.\nFor example I saw that performance regressions have been introduced in the past in exchange for more features. At one time, I saw a benchmark noting image decoding performance dropping to almost a third of its former level when upgrading libheif to a recent version compared to the older 1.6 version.\n\n\n*It is possible to use various \"tricks of the trade\" to optimize for example scrolling through a long list of photos in a photo viewer. In particular, HEIC files can actually contain embedded thumbnails encoded with JPEG. So you can do very fast decoding of 320x240 thumbnails embedded inside the HEIC file, in cases where you only need a thumbnail and can delay actual image decoding to later.\n", "Q: Is there any way to enable scrolling with XP Pen? I have XP-Pen Deco 01 V2. Things have been so great using on Mac(v13.1).\nBut, on drag (dragging pen on the tablet) it doesn't scroll the page but behaves as touch-and-hold.\nWhile on windows, things work well; it does the scrolling.\nIs there any way I could change this behaviour on mac and enable scrolling with the pen when dragging on the tablet?\n\nA: I've finally found a way to make this work:\n\n*\n\n*Set the button you like to \"mouse control > middle click\"\n\n*Set up something that can turn a middle click + drag into scrolling. What worked for me was using hammerspoon and the script outlined in https://superuser.com/questions/303424/can-i-enable-scrolling-with-middle-button-drag-in-os-x\n", "Q: What's the methodology for dealing with MacOS updates breaking npm and brew commands? There's a new MacOS update and that means once I upgrade all my terminal commands like npm and brew are going to break (ie \"zsh: command not found: brew\"). What's the optimal way of dealing with this going forward into 2023? Do addons like oh-my-zsh and powerlevel10k affect it?\n\nA: \"Command not found\" implies that the path to brew binaries got lost. A way to keep the paths is to add a file to /etc/paths.d:\ncat <<EOF\n$(brew --prefix)/bin\n$(brew --prefix)/sbin\nEOF > /tmp/homebrew\nsudo mv /tmp/homebrew /etc/paths.d/\n\nYou can do the same for other paths.\n", "Q: How to install linux on a external hdd connected to iMac How to install linux on an external HDD which is a 5TB Seagate OneTouch HDD and is connected with iMac through a USB 3 cable?\nI am new to Linux, at the moment I consider to try Linux Mint. And I want to make two partitions to this HDD. One for linux system and applications, the other one for shared data from both Linux and Mac. Please help with steps as detailed as possible. I really appreciate your help.\n\nA: The short and simple answer (assuming your particular iMac can run your chosen Linux distro) is to boot the Linux installer and let it it install/copy the relevant files to your connected drive. To boot from other partitions than the boot volume on your Mac, you’ll have to hold the Optionkey during boot up and select the volume to boot from.\nHowever, I don’t recommend you do this since you are so new to Linux/Unix environments.\nInstead, use a VM like VirtualBox (v7 supports Apple Silicon, now) and create a machine there.  You can run it in seamless mode which will give you a full desktop experience without having to mess with dual booting your Mac.  If you make a mistake, only the VM is affected, not your whole system. You can create a shared folder anywhere on your system (internal, external, and even networked drives) and share it between the host and the VM quite easily.\n", "Q: Hide windows in Dock that exist in different Space I use my laptop for both work and home use and am trying to improve logical separation of these purposes using spaces.\nI have created two spaces, but have a problem where I accidentally switch back to the wrong space because the separation of windows is not sufficient.\nFor example, if I want to use a Firefox window, the dock lists all windows that exist irrespective of which space they are in. This means my personal and work windows are muddled up and easily confused.\n\nIn the above screenshot, the first and third window should show in Space 1, and the active window should be in Space 2 (because that is what I have open now and am in space 2).\nHere's what I've done so far to improve separation:\n\n*\n\n*Disabled 'When switching to an application, switch to a Space ith open windows for the application'.\n\n*Installed AltTab to change the cmd-tab shortcut to not show windows from other spaces.\n\n\nA: You're fighting a paradigm, I'm afraid.\nmacOS was never designed to use one app over more than one Space, and there's no native functionality to do what you require.\nProbably the most efficient way to separate these pages is to use two different browsers. Otherwise, use key commands to go directly to a specific Space rather than one to go to a specific app.  Ctrl ⌃   [number]  is the default key structure, they are generated automatically for each Space you add, but not enabled by default.\nSystem Prefs > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Mission Control [up to Monterey, idk on Ventura]\n\n", "Q: Considerations and pitfalls for using MacBook Pro with external monitor keyboard and mouse My teenage daughter has a MacBook Pro M1 (2020) and we have had the screen replaced several times now, at great expense each time. Sadly it is now broken yet again ! The new plan is to use the laptop with an external 4G monitor that we already have and works well with it, and to buy an external keyboard and mouse. Since her bedroom is rather small I would like her to be able to use it with the screen/lid closed (perhaps with it rested on on it's side somehow, if that's possible?). Either wired/USB or Bluetooth keyboard & mouse.\nShe mainly uses it for school work and some digital photo/video editing.\nWhat are the considerations and potential pitfalls for using the MacBook like this ?\n\nA: Macs work well in 'clamshell' mode (e.g. closed), while attached to an external display. You can buy stands that will hold the Mac in an upright position (at a range of prices, but some very cheap).\nThe Mac has to be plugged in to the power source to use an external display in this manner. Depending on the type of display, it may have USB ports that you can plug peripherals into.\nThere are no real considerations or pitfalls, if used with care and respect.\nThe biggest consideration, I would argue, is to discover the cause of the damage to the laptop screen, and to ensure that the behaviour/situation doesn't happen again.\n", "Q: What happens to backups I lose my laptop? I have a 2021 M1 Macbook Pro that is password protected with a weak password (5 characters).\nI want to create a local backup of my Macbook but I am wondering what will happen if I lose physical access to my Macbook (e.g. if stolen).\nMy understanding of the security model of the Macbook is that the disk is encrypted with an encryption key that is different from my password. My password is simply used to retrieve the encryption key from the secure enclave, so even a weak password is sufficiently secure.\nMy questions:\n\n*\n\n*What password/security key is the external disk encrypted with?\n\n\n*\n\n*If it is encrypted with my actual password, then the encryption is very weak.\n\n*If it is encrypted with the key from the secure enclave, then this means if I lose physical access to my Macbook my data will remain forever encrypted?\n\nOr is Apple using some other mechanism for the encryption?\n\nA: I'm assuming you're talking about the built-in Time Machine backup system.\nWhen you setup Time Machine backups, you first need to select the external disk used for storing the backups. In the same window, you can checkmark \"Encrypt backups\". You need to do this to get encrypted backups.\nIf you do that, you're then prompted for a password to be used for encrypting the external disk. From the password, macOS derives the encryption key using a password-based key derivation function. This means that the weak 5 character password on your user account doesn't come into play here at all.\nHad the data just been encrypted with the password as the key, it would be possible to directly brute-force the encryption by attempting each possible password. As you can test millions of passwords per second on a home computer, this makes the encryption relatively weak.\nHowever, Apple does not do that - instead they run the password through a password-based key derivation function known as PBKDF2 in order to obtain the key. The idea is that you store a small amount of random data, called a salt, unencrypted on the external disk for backups. This data is passed along with the entered password to the key-derivation function, which then generates the encryption key.\nThe trick is now that the key-derivation function intentionally takes a long while to compute - and is constructed in such a way that no shortcuts exists to compute it faster. The salt makes sure that the function cannot be precomputed.\nThe net effect is that a hacker attempting a brute-force attack is no longer able to test millions of keys per second on a home computer, instead the problem becomes orders of magnitude harder.\nTo give an idea of the scale: instead of being able to try in the range of 100 million passwords per second on a standard home PC CPU, it is instead only possible to try 20 passwords/sec. Even if you add a dedicated GPU and specialized software, you're only going to be able to test in the range of 50.000 passwords/sec. You can throw more GPUs and power at the problem, but it is still much, much harder.\nSo to answer your point (1), the password is used as a base for creating the key, but the password is not the key itself. This means that the encryption is not \"very weak\".\nTo answer your point (2), the key is not stored solely in the secure enclave. This means that you can access the backup data from other Macs - even if you loose phyiscal access to your MacBook.\n\nA: When you create a backup on external storage, the encryption is completely separate from your computer's internal storage encryption. The backup software (Time Machine, or any 3rd party software) reads the local file (which decrypts it) and writes it to the external storage. This means that you can connect to a new computer and re-enter your password to restore your files.\nIf you have encryption configured on your external storage, then when the file is written (backed up) to the external storage, it will become encrypted with the password configured for that storage medium.\nIf you don't have encryption configured on the external storage, it is backed up unencrypted.\n\nI believe you have a misconception on how the secure enclave comes into play. If someone knows/guesses your password, they can access your files. The secure enclave does not prevent this.\nYou're correct that a separate key is used to encrypt the files, and this is to allows:\n\n*\n\n*easy password changes (avoiding the need to re-encrypt each file)\n\n*easy erasure of data (discarding the key completely)\n\n*Artificial computation requirements to extend time to convert a password into a key, extending time to brute force\n\nThis means that brute forcing password with no knowledge about the target might not be feasible, but a targeted attack against a terrible password would still be possible.\n\nIf you set your password to password on your laptop, and someone gets your laptop, they can guess password and access your files.\nIf you set your password to password for your Time Machine backup storage, and someone steals it, they can connect it to their computer and enter password and access your files.\nThis means that your backup can be read by another computer, so long as you know the password.\n\nA: Your Time Machine backup has a password. For convenience your Mac will remember that password.\nThe important thing is that if your laptop is stolen or breaks you can buy a new one and restore your backup as long as you know the password. So don’t rely on your Mac remembering the password. You MUST remember the password or keep it in a safe place.\n", "Q: Is it possible to run Chrome Browser in a virtual machine on macOS?

I want to monitor the energy usage of a medical device and - if possible - trigger actions if it is turned off by itself.\nI would like to use an Apple Home-compatible device (probably a plug) for this, for easy integration with what I have already.  A few years back I was told that the Apple Home-API's did not support power metering.\nHas this changed and is there any suitable Home-compatible devices that can do this without non-Apple app support?\n\nA: As far as I know, the Apple Home app does not support power / energy metering at all. Behind the scenes, HomeKit will allow passing vendor proprietary data along - but it is not exposed in Apple's apps.\nFor example if you buy the Eve Energy product, you can add it to the Apple Home app and use that to turn the power on/off. However, you cannot monitor power usage. For that you'll need to use the third party app.\nThe only solution for using the Apple Home app is to add a special \"bridge\" to your setup. You can use an always-powered computer (desktop, laptop or something like a Raspberry Pi, Hoobs Pro or similar) to run open-source software such as Homebridge that will allow you to create virtual HomeKit devices. From there you can define a virtual event to let the Apple Home app know that the device was turned off (i.e. power usage went to zero) - and then you can define rules on what to do with that information from the Apple Home app.\n", "Q: How to get more than 4 people to show up under People and Places, using iOS16.2 on iPhone XR?

So, while you’re updating apps in the App Store app, you send it to the background, and swipe up and close App Store by accident, while the updates are still commencing and not finished.\nDoes this interrupt the updates?\n\nA: It does not interrupt the updates.\nThe App Store app is the frontend used to install apps and updates, but the installation itself is performed in the background and doesn't depend on the App Store app running.\n\nA: You can switch to the Home screen and watch apps continue to download: you will see them greyed out with a progress 'clock' shaded over the icon.\nThe App Store is a separate process from the installer.

I need to get the user's UUID by username from the terminal (not the machine itself, but the local user).\n\nA: Rather than getting all users' IDs and searching for the right one, you can use dscl /Search -read to get just the specific user's info:\ndscl /Search -read \"/Users/$USER\" GeneratedUID\n\nThis will print something like \"GeneratedUID: B8A467BD-BCB8-47ED-9335-E0C187628DA7\". If you want just the UUID itself, you can pipe it through cut:\ndscl /Search -read \"/Users/$USER\" GeneratedUID | cut -d ' ' -f2\n\n\nA: Depending on which UID you are looking for (since there is the \"UniqueID\" and the \"GeneratedUID\"), you can find them with either...\ndscl . -list /Users UniqueID\n\n...or...\ndscl . -list /Users GeneratedUID\n\nYou can then also search by username; e.g. for the logged in user:\ndscl . -list /Users GeneratedUID | grep $(whoami)\n\nOr if you only wanted the UUID, without the username printed, you could use awk to print only the UID; e.g.\ndscl . -list /Users GeneratedUID | grep $(whoami) | awk '{print $2}'\n\n...or instead of $(whoami) you could fill in the username you are looking for.\n(I only listed the GeneratedUID for the examples above, as it's just a simple swap of expressions, i.e. just put UniqueID instead, if that's the UID you are after.)\n", "Q: Sync photos inside the Pictures folder I am new to Mac, so this might be a silly question.\nOn my Mac Air, I have the iCloud Photo sync turned on.

For over a year I have had it connected to the local network via wifi. It has a scanner function, which I normally use via the Printer application on my Mac. Today the scanner function is no longer present.\nI found some advice online to reset the print system, which involves deleting the printers in the Printers and Scanners preferences app, then re-adding them back. I tried that, and still there is no scanner function.\nWhen accessing the app, the dialog now looks like this:\n\nThis looks different from how it looked previously. But at the top right there appears to be a printer icon and a fax icon, but no scanner icon.

Since getting my new MacBook Air it requires me to create a new password every day for iCloud.  It first asks for my password because \"some account services will not be available until you sign in again\".  I never signed out.\nWhen I enter my password it says that it is the wrong password.  I then reset it to the exact same password I was using and it accepts it as a new password ant tells me that my password has been reset.  Tomorrow, I will have to do this all over again.  This can't be normal.\n\nA: You should first use https://appleid.apple.com to verify your password works properly.\nIf you receive the following popup, offering to use your fingerprint, click \"Use a different Apple ID\" (even if it shows the correct one) so that you can enter your password:\n\nOnce you've verified you can sign in and that there are no error messages on https://appleid.apple.com, note exactly what password it is (write it down if you have to) and do not change the password again, to avoid confusion.\nSign out of whichever device is giving the most frequent errors. It sounds like this is your MacBook Air.\nFully sign out of iCloud and restart the Mac, then sign back in.\nAt this point, your Mac should be behaving properly.

If not, you would be better suited with virtualization to run the \"older\" OS and let your Mac ride the firmer, recovery OS, macOS normal upgrade train.\nThere's lots of good writing on the internet as people upgraded to betas, downgraded back to production and more. I haven't seen any that contemplated the nvram or partition scheme as a good plan and most I know of ended up needing to wipe and run one OS at one time on their Apple Silicon Macs.

Virtualization wasn't even allowed until Big Sur https://www.macstadium.com/blog/developers-big-sur-and-vindication and so it was not super well supported on the new hardware.\nThere were bugs in Big Sur which caused physical damage to the mac, so while these were nominally fixed https://9to5mac.com/2021/02/25/macos-big-sur-11-2-2-usb-c-charger-fix/ it makes sense that apple might be cagier than usual about this particular downgrade.

are probably a couple of approaches you could take but here is one that should solve the specific problem here.\nuse scripting additions\nset tf to choose file with prompt \"Choose a File\" of type {\"fcpxml\", \"xml\"}\ntell application \"Finder\" to set tf2 to duplicate tf\nset textBlob to read file (tf2 as text)\n\n-- offsets to find and their lengths\nset badStr to \"offset=\"\nset badLen to (length of badStr) + 1 -- i.e. 8\nset goodStr to \"<marker start=\"\nset goodLen to (length of goodStr) + 1 -- i.e. 15\n\n-- textSpan begins as copy of source text but will be reduced\nset textSpan to text 1 thru -1 of textBlob\n\n-- find offset and string to replace\nset boffsetLft to (get offset of badStr in textSpan) + badLen\nset textSpan to text boffsetLft thru -1 of textSpan\nset boffsetRgt to (get offset of space in textSpan) - 2\nset badFound to text boffsetLft thru (boffsetLft + boffsetRgt - 1) of textBlob\n--> \"1234/3200s\"\n\n-- find offset and string to substitute\nset goffsetLft to (get offset of goodStr in textSpan) + goodLen\nset textSpan to text goffsetLft thru -1 of textSpan\nset goffsetRgt to (get offset of space in textSpan) - 2\nset goodReplace to text 1 thru goffsetRgt of textSpan\n--> \"276489053/3200s\"\n\nset AppleScript's text item delimiters to badFound\nset newTextBlob to text items of textBlob\nset AppleScript's text item delimiters to goodReplace\nset newTextBlob to newTextBlob as text\n\nThe script lets the user choose a file, which it duplicates, and then reads in that duplicate. It begins with 'use scripting additions' because the offset command is one and occasionally there is flaky behaviour with it.\nNext, it assigns the two search strings to variables along with their functional lengths. This combination will be used to set the bookend offsets for the desired strings.\nA second variable is used to provide a reducible copy of the text which will simplify things.\nNext, the 'offset' string (badFound) will be located. Its left end by finding the offset of 'offset=' and then specifying the first character after the quote. The right end by finding the first space after and then the last character before the quote. The same is then done for the replacement string (goodFound). Both results are assigned to variables.\nFinally, the entire text is split using badFound as the text delimiter and then reformed around goodFound. In your example, the first 'asset clip' line would begin like this below while the remainder of the text would be unchanged:\n<asset-clip ref=\"r3\" lane=\"1\" offset=\"6912372957/80000s\"\n\nAt this point, you can save the text or do whatever.\n\nA: If you have an XML file, it's usually advisable to parse it as XML rather than as plain text.  System Events offers a set of a commands that can descend an XML object hierarchy, and extract the attributes associated with each element.\nThe XML snippet you provided isn't actually valid XML, as it contains an extraneous </asset-clip> element.  So, in order to demonstrate the parsing of your XML snippet, I've removed the first of the two closing </asset-clip> tags:\ntell application id \"com.apple.SystemEvents\"\n        set xml to make new XML data with data \"<spine>\n        <asset-clip ref=\\\"r3\\\" lane=\\\"1\\\" offset=\\\"86400s\\\" \n                    name=\\\"Pexels Videos 1730395\\\" \n                    duration=\\\"646800/352800s\\\" \n                    format=\\\"r4\\\" tcFormat=\\\"NDF\\\" \n                    audioRole=\\\"dialogue\\\">\n                <conform-rate srcFrameRate=\\\"25\\\"/>\n                <marker start=\\\"6912372957/80000s\\\" \n                        duration=\\\"1/48000s\\\" \n                        value=\\\"Marker 2\\\"/>\n        </asset-clip>\n</spine>\"\n        \n        tell xml's XML element \"spine\" to tell ¬\n                XML element \"asset-clip\" to tell ¬\n                XML element \"marker\" to get the ¬\n                value of XML attribute \"start\"\nend tell\n\nThis returns the expected value \"6912372957/80000s\".\nSince you'll be reading the XML from an XML file rather than a string as I did above, you would start by replacing the line of code in the above script that starts:\nset xml to ...\n\n(including the XML string that is split over several lines) with:\nset xml to XML element 1 of XML file \"/path/to/file.xml\"\n\nXML element 1 represents the root element, which is always the starting point when traversing an XML hierarchy.  In the XML string I assigned to the variable xml in the above AppleScript code, the root element was the named XML element \"spine\", but if this is, itself, a child of some other ascendant XML element in your file, then it won't be the root element.\nYou'll need to construct the AppleScript reference chain that takes System Events's XML parser from XML element 1 (the root element, which is absolutely fine to reference by the index number 1 instead of its name) down through the XML object model to the XML element \"spine\", from where my code takes it the rest of the way (unless the extraneous </asset-clip> tag isn't, in fact, extraneous in the context of the file as a whole, which will need to be reflected in the AppleScript XML element chain.\nMy explanation probably makes it sound more difficult than it is in practice, and if you use my AppleScript code as a guide, you can see it's pretty straightforward, and also results in fewer lines of code—that is also going to do a more reliable job—compared to any attempt to parse the XML file as text.\n\nIn the same manner we read the start attribute of the <marker> tag, we can also assign a new value to the offset attribute of the <asset-clip> tag.\nWhere AppleScript was instructed to:\nget the value of XML attribute \"start\"\n\nyou would assign this value to a variable, then:\nset the value of XML attribute \"offset\" to ...\n\nYou will, of course, need to target the XML element \"asset-clip\" in the same hierarchical manner as was done for XML element \"marker\".  But that doesn't entail any additional work, and what you end up with is a script that literally does what needs to be done: that is to say, it finds the value of some specific attribute, and uses it to replace the existing value of some other specific attribute.  It's two operations.\n\nHowever, there's a final, third operation.  The XML containing the new value for the offset attribute will be stored in the xml variable, through which everything else is referenced.  This needs to be written out to file.\nA text representation of the XML can be obtained by way of xml's text.\nTo avoid data loss, I'd advise writing out the XML text to a separate file, then replacing the old file once you validate the new one.  In fact, your original approach was sensible, namely duplicating the XML file before reading from it, which you can simply overwrite with the new contents without too much worry.\nDuplicating has to be done via Finder:\ntell application id \"com.apple.finder\" to duplicate ¬\n        the file (\"/path/to/file.xml\" as POSIX file) ¬\n        to (\"/path/to/newfile.xml\" as POSIX file)\n\nWriting out is done like so:\ntell application id (\"com.apple.SystemEvents\")\n                  .\n                  .\n        (* all the code to get and replace\n           the attributes's values *)\n                  .\n                  .\n        set xmlText to the xml's text\nend tell\n\nset the eof of \"/path/to/newfile.xml\" to 0 --> scrubs the file\nwrite the xmlText as \"utf8\" to \"/path/to/newfile.xml\"\n\n", "Q: libgd vs rubygem local-fastimage_resize on M1 This works on x86 mac but fails an M1 mac.\n$ brew install pkg-config libgd\n$ gem install local-fastimage_resize\n\nI suspect it might be something with libgd packaging on M1.

The command in question is:\ndo shell script \"open https://apple.stackexchange.com\"\n\n\nA: You can double-click on a 'bare' text shell script, if it has the file extension .command, and it will launch in Terminal and run.\nThis would need to be written in Unix shell, not AppleScript, so:\n#!/bin/zsh\n\nopen https://apple.stackexchange.com\n\nIf you just want to launch a webpage, you can drag the URL from the URL bar in Safari into the Finder, and you will get a webloc file.

How to recover the 253 GB missing? I am not sure how to solve this.\nI used to have macOS Monterey on my iMac late 2015 and it was running a bit slow. So I removed it, formatted the drive and did a fresh install of macOS Mojave, which makes it run smooth.\nHowever, the drive is not showing 1 TB in Disk Utility nor Terminal's diskutil list, just the partition with the 743 GB. I am not sure how to regain the missing space.\nThis is what I see:\n\n\nAs you can see, disk0 shows 1 TB.\nAnyone knows how to get the full 1 TB back without having to go through the formatting/installation process again?\nThank you very much in advance!\nUPDATE: Adding extra info as requested by David Anderson and Ezekiel:\n\n\n\nA: As you already discovered, the missing space is between disk0s1 and disk0s2. There is no simple method of adding this free space to your fresh install of Mojave. The easiest method would be to do another new fresh install where you erase the entire drive before installing Mojave. Below are the basic steps to install Mojave by use of a USB flash drive.\n\n*\n\n*Download Mojave from the Apps Store.\n\n*Install the downloaded file to create the install application.\n\n*Use the application to create a USB flash drive installer.\n\n*Boot from the flash drive. (Hold down the option key at startup)\n\n*Erase the entire drive using the APFS format.\n\n*Install macOS to the new APFS volume.\n\nAny Mac where the version of macOS requires the use of APFS will perform poorly, if installed entirely on a HDD. In other words, not installed on a SSD or Fusion drive. I have an iMac (21.5-inch, Late 2013) with a 1 GB SATA HDD. I encountered a significant increase in performance by installing macOS on an external USB SSD. I would probably get even better performance by replacing the internal SATA HDD with a internal SATA SSD. However, I did not wish to go through the trouble of dismantling the Mac. Currently, you can get a 500 GB Samsung T7 SSD for 105 CAD with free shipping.\n", "Q: How can I get back menu bar icon of an agent app? I use Clipy.app and it's an \"agent app\", which means it runs in the background and doesn't appear in the Dock.\nBy default, it shows the app icon on the top right of the menu bar of Mac. However, I remove the icon by mouse dragging with holding command. Then I can't find the icon anymore, even if I re-install the app.\nHow can I get back menu bar icon of Clipy.app?\n\nA: On the whole and especially if the application is not self-contained in the app sandbox one should also delete its preference file, which usually can be found in ~/Library/Preferences/.  Searching for the application's name in that folder in many cases yields a result.\nHad it been self contained, the application would have had a container in...\n~/Library/Containers/\n\nor\n~/Library/Group Containers/\n\n...which would include its Preference file within.  In this case the whole container could be removed.\nDelete the .plist file and either reboot, or see also here:\nReload modified system plist\nAnother way to find the plist's name:\na=$(defaults domains | sed 's/,/\\\\n/g'); printf \"$a\" | grep \"Clipy\"\n\nIn your specific case, deleting the menu bar item key from the preference file did the trick:\ndefaults delete com.clipy-app.Clipy kCPYPrefShowStatusItemKey\n\n\"kCPYPrefShowStatusItemKey\" by default is not present, unless one changes the menu bar icon, or it has been set to 'none'.\nPS.Setting the menu bar item to 'none' implies that one wants to solely use the shortcut keys to launch windows like the \"history\" window, which includes a link to \"Preferences\" and therefore a way to change the menu bar item.  So it would be good to remember them and to make sure the shortcut keys are functional.\n", "Q: What's the grammar of the Dynamic Store's DNS config? This helpful answer talks about how using the dynamic store is preferred over the bsd-style /etc/resolver/* files, and includes a helpful example. I did find some docs that mention the same dns properties, but it does leave some questions. Is this doc relevant to the dynamic store? Why does it only talk about these properties being valid when configuring a IKEv2 VPN? In this specific example, how does the wildcard work?\nHere, a wildcard is given to both ServerAddresses and SupplementalMatchDomains. How does this work?\nsudo scutil\nd.init\nd.add ServerAddresses * 9.9.9.9\nd.add SupplementalMatchDomains * stackexchange.com\nset State:/Network/Service/whatever-you-want-as-long-as-unique/DNS\n\nApple says about ServerAddresses:\n\nAn array of DNS server IP address strings. These IP addresses can be a\nmixture of IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.\n\nApple says about SupplementalMatchDomains:\n\nA list of domain strings used to determine which DNS queries will use\nthe DNS resolver settings contained in ServerAddresses. This key is\nused to create a split DNS configuration where only hosts in certain\ndomains are resolved using the tunnelʼs DNS resolver. Hosts not in one\nof the domains in this list are resolved using the systemʼs default\nresolver. If SupplementalMatchDomains contains the empty string it\nbecomes the default domain. This is how a split-tunnel configuration\ncan direct all DNS queries first to the VPN DNS servers before the\nprimary DNS servers. If the VPN tunnel becomes the networkʼs default\nroute, the servers listed in ServerAddresses become the default\nresolver and the SupplementalMatchDomains list is ignored.\n\n\nA: \nIs this doc relevant to the dynamic store?\n\nNot directly but Apple uses the same options throughout the entire system and wherever they are used, they also have the same meaning.\nThe Dynamic Store is where certain dynamic aspects of the current system configuration is stored, which mainly the network configuration (including active VPN configuration), the machine name and some power saving settings. The sc in scutil stands for System Configuration.\nConfiguration Profiles are used to provide Macs/iPhones with a predefined configuration setup, e.g. if a company wants to roll out thousand devices to employees, that all shall use the same base configuration, then you put that configuration into a profile and upload that profile to each of these devices. And one thing you may want to configure in such a profile is a VPN setup, so these devices have access to some internal company LAN via VPN and to describe that configuration, the same keys are used as in the Dynamic Store.\n\nWhy does it only talk about these properties being valid when configuring a IKEv2 VPN?\n\nYou typically don't roll out a static network configuration via profile, you'd rather setup a DHCP server and provide network configuration based on the device's hardware (MAC) address.\nHowever, the PDF you've linked is from 2019. If I check the current online references for device profiles, it does mention those keys also for the case you want to push a static DNS configuration to devices:\nhttps://developer.apple.com/documentation/devicemanagement/dnssettings/dnssettings\nBTW, the documentation of the System Configuration framework itself can be found here:\nhttps://developer.apple.com/documentation/systemconfiguration\nIt also does list all the existing keys, e.g. here are all the DNS related keys:\nhttps://developer.apple.com/documentation/systemconfiguration/scschemadefinitions/dns_entity_keys\nBut it does not really provide any explanation since that documentation is intended for developers that should know what these keys mean (and if they don't, they should not touch them).\n\nIn this specific example, how does the wildcard work?\n\nThe commands mean:\nd.init\n\nInitialize a new dictionary (a key/value data structure, where values are referenced by a key; some programming languages would also call that a hash or a associative array)\nd.add ServerAddresses * 9.9.9.9\n\nAdd a new entry to the dictionary named ServerAddresses of type array (*) with a value of 9.9.9.9\nd.add SupplementalMatchDomains * stackexchange.com\n\nAdd a new entry to the dictionary named SupplementalMatchDomains of type array (*) with a value of stackexchange.com\nset State:/Network/Service/whatever-you-want-as-long-as-unique/DNS\n\nSave the current dictionary to the Dynamic Store under the key \nState:/Network/Service/whatever-you-want-as-long-as-unique/DNS\nFor more details, see echo help | scutil:\n d.add key [*#?%] val [v2 ...]  : add information to dictionary\n       (*=array, #=number, ?=boolean, %=hex data)\n\nd.add KEY VALUE would also create a dictionary entry named KEY with a value VALUE but that value would be of type string. By adding *, #, ? or % you can change the value type accordingly.\nCompare:\n> d.init\n> d.add someKey someValue\n> d.show\n<dictionary> {\n  someKey : someValue\n}\n\nwith:\n> d.init\n> d.add someKey * someValue\n> d.show\n<dictionary> {\n  someKey : <array> {\n    0 : someValue\n  }\n}\n> \n\n", "Q: Malware in Anker charge base for iPhone? The iPhone screen moving on its own, like someone is controlling it remotely? I have an iPhone XR (fully up-to-date on iOS 16) and an Anker Wireless Charger.\nTwice now while the phone was sitting on the charging base I have seen the screen come on and begin scrolling down the phone, then other movements happen; it looks like someone is controlling the phone remotely, but is this even possible via a charging base? I am an IT Professional and so am not ignorant of this sort of thing and (to my knowledge) there is no way to control an iPhone remotely other than \"Switch Control\" and that is disabled (Settings > Accessibility > Switch Control).\nI just noticed the Apple Watch charger is beside it; could that be the culprit here? Perhaps the wireless charging base is just malfunctioning?\n\nA: That’s a Qi charger; it has no software/firmware embedded. Additionally, there is no data transfer over the wireless charging.   Yes, there is power negotiation, but your phone cannot receive data nor send data over the charging coils.\n\nit looks like someone is controlling the phone remotely\n\nThere is an easy way to test this: put your phone in Airplane Mode prior to placing it on the charging base.  Since the base has no way to communicate to the outside world, any scrolling you now observe will be local meaning it’s not being remotely controlled.\nWhat could it be?\nRemember, your screen is capacitive meaning a slight electrical field could cause your screen to respond (though very, very unlikely).  Your Apple Watch, if unlocked, can unlock an iPhone in proximity; move your Apple Watch to verify.  Also move the charger to verify it’s not interfering.\nFinally, the behavior you’re seeing is not “hacking.”  Hackers don’t do what they do to scroll your screen.  They plant apps and malware to steal your data or use your devices as an attack vector.  Scrolling screens is a waste of time and alerts  you to their presence; the last thing a hacker wants.\n", "Q: How can I configure what sites are used by Safari for dictionary definitions? I wanted to verify my understanding of the Greek phrase \"hoi poloi\", which has been borrowed by English, so I typed it into Safari's search bar and was prompted with a suggested dictionary entry.  I clicked on it and was taken to a page on Dictionary.com that had virtually nothing other than ads and similar assorted trash.  Nowhere on the page was any definition of \"hoi poloi\"\nThis is obviously totally useless.  I don't know whether the fault is with Safari or (more likely) with Dictionary.com or something in between, but it doesn't really matter—it simply needs to be fixed somehow.  How or where can I configure this to behave differently.  The worst acceptable case is that I just disable this and am not lured off the normal path of searching through DuckDuckGo.com/search.Brave.com/whatever, which actually works.\n\nI'm using Safari 16.1 (17614.2.9.1.13, 17614) on macOS 12.6 (21G115).  Safari's search engine is set to DuckDuckGo.\n\nA: You should be able to change the Dictionary sources the Dictionary App used (what you’re clicking on).  In the app, go to Settings and you should be able to configure the sources, their order and what options (where applicable) are available.\nYou can find more info on Apple Support for Dictionary App.\n\nA: DuckDuckGo may not do what you want with \"hoi polloi\" because technically that is not Greek.  If I type οι πολλοι into DuckDuckGo, I get several useful explanations.  But there's not much you can do to change the way DuckDuckGo searches.\nI would suggest that an easier way to look things up is to use Apple's built-in dictionaries, which Allan mentioned in his answer.  That is configurable.  You just right-click or Ctrl-click on a word or a selected phrase and a menu pops up.  The top two items are usually \"look up (item)\" and \"translate (item)\"  For lookup, in MacOS, you can then click \"open in Dictionary\" to see the whole thing.  In IOS, you tap a definition to see the whole thing.\nThe translate option is apparently Apple's own product rather than a call to something else.  But I'm not certain, because without internet access, it just says \"not available.\"\n", "Q: Sticky bit on /tmp doesn't do what it's supposed to? I frequently run a script that creates three files in /tmp and then moves them to the destination directory.  I was puzzled by the error messages:\nmv: ./20170608-l.gpx: set owner/group (was: 503/0): Operation not permitted\nmv: ./20170608-u.gpx: set owner/group (was: 503/0): Operation not permitted\nmv: ./20170608.csv: set owner/group (was: 503/0): Operation not permitted\n\nThe script doesn't use sudo, so the group wheel (zero) seemed odd.  Checking /tmp (/private/tmp) shows the sticky bit is on it.  But forcing the group to be wheel (which I expect that to happen) is not what Wikipedia (quoting a Leopard man page) says it will do.  And preventing me from changing the group on the copy is neither.  The copy ends up with the same owner—me—and my group—staff—so it actually did what it said was not permitted.\nI can see a rationale for what the man page says, but why does the error message say that something different was not allowed when it actually did exactly that?  And why are files in /tmp created with group wheel when that is not what the sticky bit is for?\n/tmp is root/wheel as expected,\nWGroleau@MBP ~ % ls -latde@ /private/tmp\ndrwxrwxrwt  7 root  wheel  224 Dec 21 09:58 /private/tmp\n\nbut the doc mentioned says that sticky bit prevents deletion by someone else but the owner.  Since I was the owner, that doesn't matter.  But it doesn't say what I thought it meant, which was to override the creator's group.  However, the latter is what did happen.  And then the error message falsely states that it was not able to change the group to mine.  Not sure whether changing the group is required when the destination does not have a sticky bit:\nWGroleau@MBP ~ % ls -late@d /Volumes/Sidecar/Sort_By_Date/2017年/06月/08日\ndrwxrwxr-x  16 WGroleau  staff  512 Dec 20 23:35 /Volumes/Sidecar/Sort_By_Date/2017年/06月/08日\n\n\nA: The source code for mv is available on Github, the part relating to the error is in line 448.\noldmode = sbp->st_mode & ALLPERMS;\nif (fchown(to_fd, sbp->st_uid, sbp->st_gid)) {\n    warn(\"%s: set owner/group (was: %lu/%lu)\", to, (u_long)sbp->st_uid, (u_long)sbp->st_gid);\n    if (oldmode & (S_ISUID | S_ISGID)) {\n        warnx(\"%s: owner/group changed; clearing suid/sgid (mode was 0%03o)\", to, oldmode);\n        sbp->st_mode &= ~(S_ISUID | S_ISGID);\n    }\n}\n\nWhat actually happens within mv is the following:\n\n*\n\n*As this is a regular file getting moved to an another filesystem, the command can't use the standard rename() system call but uses an internal function to create a new file on the target filesystem, copy the content over and then delete the source file\n\n*Initially the target file is created with the default group of the user (usually staff)\n\n*After the copy is done, the command tries to apply the owner and group of the source file to the newly created target (the fchown() call in the second line of the code snippet above\n\n*Files in /tmp belong to group wheel but normal users are not part of that group, so fchown() fails, leading to the warning message.\n\nThis also means that sudo mv /tmp/foo /Volumes/External/ will succeed without a warning:\n$ touch /tmp/foo\n$ mv /tmp/foo /Volumes/EXT\nmv: /Volumes/EXT/foo: set owner/group (was: 502/0): Operation not permitted\n$ touch /tmp/foo\n$ sudo mv /tmp/foo /Volumes/EXT\n$\n\n\nA: Your question comes from a misunderstanding of why the files have wheel as group - as it simply doesn't have anything at all to do with the sticky bit.\nThe sticky bit works as intended - and does what it has always done. There's no special handling for the /tmp folder in that regards.\nIn general, a user that has write and execute permissions for a directory is allowed to rename and delete files in that directory. As you see in your paste, all others have write and execute permissions on the /tmp directory. This creates the problem that any user can delete other user's temporary files. That is not desirable.\nThe sticky bit solves this by declaring to the system that you do not want the usual semantics of directory permissions. Instead only the owner of the file, the owner of the /tmp directory or the root user can rename and delete files in /tmp.\nSo that was the sticky bit - nothing in that explanation said anything about the group wheel.\nThat comes from a basic fact about file system permissions on Unix-like systems, such as for example macOS. It is so that when you create a file on these systems, the group of the new file is by default the group of the folder the file is created in. As the /tmp folder has group wheel, new files created in the /tmp folder will by default have group wheel.\nWhen you later try to move files from /tmp to other file systems, the mv program will try to make the destination file have the same owner and group as the original file. This fails because you cannot set the group of the new file to wheel - instead the file ends up having the default group - namely the group of the folder where the file is created.\n", "Q: How to cancel authorization to filter network content in Macbook?

The hotspot will stay on and available so long as one device is connected to it, then the phone shuts it down to preserve battery and you must re-join using that notification (which enables the hotspot, then joins it.)\n", "Q: How to “sync” a laptop to an external hard drive if the hard drive is larger than the laptop drive? I have what should be a really simple question but Google Search is failing me.\nI have a lot of data (TBs) on Dropbox. My laptop hard drive has only 500 GB. For the last few years, I’ve been using the sync feature on Dropbox and only downloading what I need for my laptop as needed. So, at any given time, I only have 500 GB of data locally, with the rest “on the cloud”.\nProblem: I want to stop using Dropbox. So what do I do? If I make a copy of all my Dropbox files on a 15 TB external hard drive, then how can I sync up the hard drive with my laptop to make the hard drive function like Dropbox does?\nWhen I try to google this, I only ever find how to “backup” my laptop. All the software seems to focus on making an image of the laptop hard drive and then syncing from there. But that is not what I want to do.\nI want all my data to sit on a 15 TB hard drive and then pull in a small subset “local copy” to my laptop as needed. When I plug in the external hard drive, all the changes made on my laptop will be mirrored on the external.\nAm I over thinking this? There must be a simple solution that I’m missing here…\n\nA: To get off of Dropbox, the easiest thing to do is set your Dropbox folder settings to be on the external drive, and tell it to download everything. Then, it should download all your contents to the external drive.\nHowever, there's no easy way to \"sync\" with the external drive, most notably because it's not always available. If it were always available, then you would just work directly off it.\nIf you are commonly working on the same project, then keep it on your local computer and everything else on the external drive. When you finish that project, copy it to the external drive and remove it from your local computer.\nIf you are commonly working on all 1.5 TB of data, you just need to keep your external drive connected at all times you're working.\n", "Q: Some apps don't accommodate small screen of iPhone SE I rarely install apps because I don't want to navigate the uncertain security implications.  On the few occasions that I do, however, a significant portion of those apps seem to be designed only for phone with larger screens.  Essential parts of the display reside below the bottom edge of the iPhone SE screen.  Some pages of some apps allow scrolling/panning, but not always.  Sometimes, it seems that they assumed that no one would have a phone so small as to be unable to access the bottom portions of the content, so the content doesn't scroll, and I can't access the bottom parts.\nFor example, some parts of the Tim Hortons app for reward points allows you to redeem points for food/beverages, but some parts of the menu becomes inaccessible.  Another example is an app to access a certain vendor's security camera; it requires that you create an account with the company, but I can only access the login fields -- not the links to create an account, which are below the bottom edge of the display.  I don't know if I can use a friend's bigger phone to create an account, but even if I could, the controls for accessing the video are also way down, and would be inaccessible using my iPhone SE.\nI tried using a pinch gesture to shrink the size of the content so that the content lower down on the page would fit on the screen.  Resizing of the content doesn't seem to be possible.\nThe iPhone SE is not a rare phone.  I can't be the only one butting against this problem.  How do others deal with this?\n\nA: Unfortunately this is all too common with unsuitable app development and quality assurance practices. I would consider this issue to be a bug with the app that should be reported to the developer. Apps should be able to be used with any text size, but this may help in the short term:\n\nAdjust the text size when you’re using an app\n\n*\n\n*Open Control Center, then tap the Text Size button.\n(If you don’t see the Text Size button, add it to Control Center—go to Settings  > Control Center, then choose Text Size).\n\n\n*Drag the slider up or down to increase or decrease the text size.\nTo change the text size for all apps, tap All Apps at the bottom of the screen.\n\nhttps://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/iph3e2e1fb0/ios\n", "Q: Finder not showing all folders of home folder In a terminal, ls -al, lists the complete folder contents of the home folder. Among the folders, there are Downloads and Documents. Both have the exact same access rights set.\nNow when I open the home folder in Finder. The Documents folder is missing. Why?\n\n\n\nA: The folders are hidden by default (and design) when viewing the contents of your user folder in Finder, and by mechanisms other than the standard flags, (possibly when iCloud is enabled, but I can't test at present, and discussions as to Apple's motives are OT).\nIf you use ls -l@ad ~/Documents in Terminal, however you will see iCloud specific extended attributes that no-doubt instruct Finder to perform some special behaviour for the Folder to hide it. There will be a comparable structure in ~/Library also which enables the iCloud replication to work. Of course, this applies to ~/Desktop also. That is the limit of my knowledge unfortunately.\n% ls -l@ad ~/Documents\ndrwx------@ 268 USER  staff  8576 11 Jan 14:59 /Users/USER/Documents\n    com.apple.icloud.desktop       9 \n    com.apple.macl    72 \n    com.apple.metadata:_kMDItemUserTags   42\n\nHowever, the hidden folders can be shown in Finder using Cmd-Shift-Period.

There are several apps that allow you to backup iMessages, but only what already exists on a device, which is only be a subset of the complete set stored in iCloud. Neither iCloud backups nor computer backups include iMessages from iCloud.\nI have 16GB of messages according to iCloud, but my phone only reports 8GB. Is there a way to force my phone or (ideally) Mac to download the entire message history, so it can be archived?\n\nA: Unfortunately, the only way I know of to force older messages to download to the iPhone from iCloud for Messages (iCloud Messages syncing) is to scroll up in the conversations you want to download on the Messages app. With a conversation open in the Messages app, tapping the time/battery status bar at the top will scroll a big jump up - that at least makes the scrolling go a little quicker.\nI would love to know a better way, so I hope someone else has a better answer!\n", "Q: How do I kill the running app when I can't swipe upwards I launched an app on my iPhone, and shortly after launch it stopped doing anything; but whatever it did has stopped the swipe-up gesture from working, so I can't get to the application switcher to kill it.  I can use the side button to lock and unlock the phone, so I can get to the Lock Screen, and I can swipe down to get to the control centre, but no matter where or how much I swipe upwards the app just keeps running in the foreground.  I don't think the app has hung, because I'd have thought the OS would have killed it by now; it just sits there intercepting the swipes.\nI have other things running in the background which I want to keep running, so I don't want to turn my phone off.  I've seen that there are accessibility settings which might help... but they're no good to me as I can't get to the settings app.\nHow do I kill the running app, without turning the phone off or changing any settings, when swiping up doesn't bring up the application switcher?\n\nA: If you have Siri enabled, you should be able to tell it to “Turn on VoiceControl” and then once that’s enabled, use your voice to tell your phone to “Open App Switcher” (voice control will always be listening for your voice to give it commands, you don’t need to activate Siri again)\n", "Q: Batch change album/artist info – not working when files are missing? Some time during the transition from iTunes to Music (or perhaps another time), more than a thousand of my songs got mangled and the links from the library to the files were broken.\nI have my media located under /Volumes/Media/iTunes/iTunes Media/, and this is also the location set in library settings in Music; but somehow the path for these 1000+ files is under /Volumes/Media/Music/Music, even though that location has never been used, so Music complains about missing files. I am now trying to re-associate these songs using the FixLinks script.\nIn many cases, however, it looks like something’s gone wrong when editing metadata, or perhaps I’ve manually renamed folders on disk for some reason (though I don’t know why I would) – at any rate, things like artist and album names in Music do not match the file and folder names on disk. The names on disk are correct, and the metadata in Music is incorrect.\nSince this is generally something that affects larger groups of songs, I wanted to batch change the relevant info in Music. What I expected to do:\n\n*\n\n*Select an album / artist / group of songs\n\n*Get Info\n\n*Fix the data that need fixing\n\n*Hit OK\n\n*Run FixLinks script and correctly match library item to file on disk\n\nBut no. Editing the incorrect data and hitting OK has absolutely no effect whatsoever. No metadata is changed if files are missing, but only in that one scenario where I select multiple songs with missing files:\n\n\n\n\n\nSingle file\nMultiple files\n\n\n\n\nFiles present\n✅\n✅\n\n\nFiles missing\n✅\n❌\n\n\n\n\nThis leaves me back at editing metadata one song at a time – which is not particularly fun when there are 700 songs to edit, and I’d rather not have to.\nIs this a bug in Music? Is there some way to get around it?\n\nA: What you see in the library isn’t a link.  It’s a database entry and if you drill down into the track’s details, it will have have an entry for the “file” that will be a full path and filename.\nIf the file is no longer in the location indicated, you won’t be able to write any metadata.  Everything must written to the file - ID3 Tag1 - first for the database to be updated.\nYou have two options here: locate the file and move it to the location specified in the track metadata or delete the track and re-import it.\n\n1The ID3 tag is a metadata container that is used with music and movie files. It typically contains info such as title name, album, year, and even cover art.  Apple Music also has its own metadata fields that are populated from the ID3 tags. \n", "Q: How to remove iPhone as a source device for sleep data (Apple Health) For any app that wants to read or write data to Apple Health, I can give or refuse permission to do so.

I am using a Tendak USB Floppy Disk Drive (https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B01NCV01GY?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details).\nThe MacBook Pro recognizes the disk and I can see the .WPS file. In Finder, I tried to copy the file into my Downloads folder. It begins copying (I can hear the disk whirring, etc.) and after about 30 seconds (it varies), an error pops up:\n\"The Finder can't complete the operation because some data in \"filename.WPS\" can't be read or written.\n(Error code -36)\"\nI can open the (partially) copied file in TextEdit and I can see portions of the text, but not the complete file. It seems highly variable what, if anything is copied. Sometimes nothing is copied. Sometimes entire paragraphs are copied. Sometimes paragraphs are copied twice or out of order. In addition, it appears that some paragraphs are copied incorrectly into random characters.\nHas anyone experienced this before? I guess the problem could be in the floppy disk itself, in the Tendak drive I bought, or in the copy command. If it's in the copy command, is there a way to force the copy to proceed despite any errors it encounters? If it's in the floppy disk or the drive, does anyone have any solutions?\nAlso, when I try to open the .WPS file on the floppy disk directly into TextEdit, it gives an error and says it can't be opened.\nAll I want is the text in the .WPS file. The copied file doesn't have to be .WPS.\n\nA: As the error says, it's struggling to read the disk.\nAssuming the floppy hasn't been subject to external magnetic forces over time, then it's equally likely to be a head alignment or substrate shedding issue. The magnetic surface of old floppies can turn over time to either dust, or some very sticky substance that will tear itself off the surface & stick to the drive's read heads… or sometimes both, at different depths.\nIn the audio world this is known as sticky-shed syndrome where it has received a lot of attention due to the financial & cultural cost of losing some of these valuable old tapes. The same happens with floppies.. though people more often tend to just give up & throw them away, so it hasn't received nearly so much attention & research.\nBack in the day it was rare two floppy drives had the same line-up. You could on some occasions traverse half the office trying to find a machine that would read a particularly errant disk… & that's before your current worry of how much the disk is now shedding surface material.\nIf the data is important, take it to a recovery specialist.\nIf it's a head alignment issue, it's unlikely any home user will have the necessary equipment… oscilloscope & working tolerances of 0.03mm are not really in DIY territory. If it's substrate, then every time you re-attempt to read it you could be further damaging the surface & also clog the heads, making each attempt less likely to succeed unless you have the tools to clean the heads themselves.\n", "Q: Available disk space slowly decreasing My computer is a late 2011 MacBookPro with an original 128 SSD running MacOs 10.13.6.\nFor some years now the total of the used disk space plus the available disk space has been slowly shrinking.\nIn particular, the available space keeps (slowly) decreasing, even if I do not use additional storage space.\nRight now the free space is 11.5 GB out of a total capacity of 128 GB.\nLooking at \"About This Mac > Storage\" I see the following (\"Documents\" is 31.77 GB, blue is \"Apps\" with 6.69 GB, dashed is \"Other Volumes in Container\" with 3.88 GB)\n\nUsing OmniDiskSweeper v1.11 I get this instead\n\nthat sums up to roughly 67 GB used in total.\nMy question is: what is eating up disk space behind the curtains? Is this a software related problem or an hardware related problem? (since my SSD is one decade old, is there some mechanism that marks SSD sectors as unavailable when they break or become unreliable?)\nAdditional information:\n\n*\n\n*Time machine is enabled, I did the latest backup yesterday on an external hard disk, but available space did not change, even after a restart.\n\n*About three months ago I made an accurate clean up of my hard disk using \"Clean my Mac\" to detect junk and manually deleted the actually useless files (caches, old files, unused apps, ...) reaching 25 GB of free space.

Sound I/O bad? I typically use the headphone jack output to my mixer.  I used a 3.5mm to RCA left and right connectors which is connected to my stereo amp.\nI forgot stereo amp was on, and for some reason a spark zapped the sound on my MAcBook Air.  All other functions on the MBA are working fine.\nIs it possible the I/O sound card is blown?  I’m not sure if the I/O sound board generates the sound or does it get generated from  sound circuitry on the main board?\n\nA: Sound is generated on the main logic board and converted to analog (what goes to the 3.5mm jack via a DAC (Digital Analog Converter) chip.  There is also additional circuity near the jack that handles this audio.\nIt is likely you fried this.  To see if your sound chip still functions, go into the System Profiler and look for the audio adapter. If it shows details, it means it is still functional and only the circuitry at or near the jack has failed.\nYou could potentially get this repaired, but you’d be better off getting a USB Audio Adapter* or a Bluetooth headphone.  It will be less expensive and the quality much better (depending on the quality of the device you purchase).\n\n* If you’re going to connect your Mac to audio gear, my recommendation is to avoid the built in audio.  It’s good for the average user, but if you want quality sound, you need quality gear.  The DAC in the MBA isn’t that.  Besides, if you had a USB adapter, it would have taken the zap and not your Mac (cheap insurance). \n", "Q: Command+backquote (switch to nexrt window) shortcut no longer works correctly in Mail after upgrading to Ventura This is a very strange one. I just upgraded to Ventura (13.0.1) and have discovered that for some reason the keyboard shortcut Command+backquote, which is supposed to cycle through windows of the currently-active app, no longer works properly when the active app is Mail.\nSpecifically, Command+backquote will bring focus to the next window, but after cycling through all of the windows once, it will not return to the first window again.  So if I have, say, a drafts open in a separate window, plus the Message Viewer in another window, I can't toggle back and forth between them using the shortcut — I can use it once, and it's effectively a one-way trip.  Holding down Shift+Command+backquote does work for going backwards, but frankly that's a pain, and it never used to work this way.\nI have verified that in Finder and Safari the keyboard shortcut still works the way it used to, so this seems to be specific to Mail.\nDoes anybody have any idea why this is happening, or if there is some way to fix it?\n\nA: I guess I still don't know why this was happening, but I now know how to fix it:  just updated to Ventura 13.1, and the problem is solved.\n", "Q: Enclosing folder shortcut not working from Desktop with Desktop backup enabled Usually, when I use the shortcut Cmd+↑ when I am on the Desktop, my Mac opens a Finder window of the parent folder where the Desktop folder is located (hence the enclosing folder).\nHowever, since I have enabled iCloud backup of the Desktop and Documents folders, the enclosing folder shortcut from the Desktop no longer opens up the finder window where the Desktop folder is located. Instead, the shortcut does nothing.\nI believe the problem is the iCloud backup option. When you turn on the Desktop backup feature, the Desktop folder is actually stored in the iCloud Drive section, rather than the User folder where it usually would be.\nI still want my Desktop folder to be backed up, but I also want the Cmd+↑ shortcut from the Desktop to work. Is there a way to do this?\n\nA: The parent folder of the Desktop is the Home folder, or iCloud Drive, if you turn on the Desktop backup feature.

I have a 21-inch late 2013 iMac that I sometimes want to use as a display for my Windows laptop using Target Display Mode. My laptop has a Thunderbolt 3 port.\nWill I be able to use the Apple Thunderbolt 3 to 2 Adapter to connect my laptop to the iMac's display?\nSince the adapter is quite expensive, are there cheaper alternatives to that would get it working? My laptop also has an HDMI port.\nI read that using a USB-C/HDMI to mini DisplayPort adapter won’t t work with iMac computers after 2010. Since Thunderbolt uses the DisplayPort protocol, why doesn't it work?\n\nA: Since the 2013 iMac requires a Thunderbolt connection for Target Display Mode (not DisplayPort), the Apple Thunderbolt 3 to Thunderbolt 2 adapter should work just fine. HDMI is not related in any way to TDM.\nThe Apple adapter works well, but if you want an alternative, take a look at the StarTech TB3 to Legacy Adapter.\nAll Thunderbolt ports - 1 through 3 - have the DisplayPort signaling (actual electrical signals, not protocol) along with the PCIe bus signals. HDMI is nowhere to be found on the TB port.\n\nA: According to this post, what I am wanting to do is impossible even though my Windows laptop has thunderbolt.\n", "Q: How to launch iOS/iPadOS apps from shell in macOS with Apple Silicon?

What cables/adapters to use?\n\nA: The latest Apple Studio Display (2022) uses a Thunderbolt 3 connection for video. You will need this adapter to connect to the monitor and this cable to connect with the Thunderbolt 2 port on your MBP.\nDon't skimp on these two accessories. If you can find similar Belkin or Anker items, those are acceptable substitutes. Years of testing adapters and cables of all sorts for my job has lead to these two manufacturers (other than Apple-branded items) as having the best build quality and proper specs. (Apple-recommended items also make the grade, or Apple wouldn't make them available in their store.)\nDisclaimer: I have no financial interest or ties with Belkin, Anker  or Apple.\n\nA: With Apple's TB3 adapter and TB2 cable, Studio display could identify and re-arrange/change resolution by my MacBook Air early 2014(Catalina) and it works with keyboard connected to it.

You didn't post a Python script, so I made one up: mypyapp.py.\nApologies, I'm not a PyGuy! I saved it as ~/scripts/mypyapp.py. All it does is grab the contents of the pasteboard, and print it to stdio. You can augment it, or put the relevant code in your script:\n#!/opt/local/bin/python3\nimport sys, subprocess\n\ndef get_clipboard_data():\n    p = subprocess.Popen([\"pbpaste\"], stdout=subprocess.PIPE)\n    retcode = p.wait()\n    data = p.stdout.read()\n    return data\n\nnew_data = get_clipboard_data()\n\nprint('clipboard data: ',new_data)\n\n2. Make the script executable:\nchmod 755 ~/scripts/mypyapp.py\n\nNote: You can run this script from the command line to test it before proceeding; make sure you copy a line of text using commandc before running the script - otherwise the pasteboard may be empty!:\n~/path/to/mypyapp.py\n\n3. Enter this line in your zsh config file - ~/.zshrc:\nbindkey -s '\\eg' '~/scripts/mypyapp.py^M' \n\n4. source your ~/.zshrc file as shown below to load the revised config file into your shell:\n. ~/.zshrc\n\n# alternatively, use the command 'source ~/.zshrc'\n\n5.

'\\eg' was expected to mean optiong. But it seems that macos has overruled that choice, replacing it with ^[g; which is translated as follows:\ncontrol[ + g\nThe sequence is a bit tricky; you must press both control[, then release both, and then finally g.\nThat's it\nI didn't test this thoroughly, so make sure you do before committing it to to a serious application.

I.e. overwriting the whole disk with zeroes, ones or \"HELLO WORLD\" or anything like that.\nKnowing the pattern doesn't make it any less of an obstacle for spies to.\nNote that in any case, this type of secure erase is only suitable for magnetic storage such as old-fashioned hard disk drives, or even more old-fashioned floppy disk drives.

Both have flat screen digital displays. The original operating system being using was macOS Mojave. The TV is fairly old (about 20 years) and the monitor is fairly new (about 5 years). The HDMI jack on the TV was connected by a HDMI cable to an adaptor, which then was connect to an USB-C jack on the Mac. The HDMI jack on the monitor was connected to the HDMI jack on the Mac by a HDMI cable. Both the TV and monitor was set at a maximum resolution of 1080p.\nRecently a new container partition was added where Ventura was installed. This allows the Mac to boot to either Mojave or Ventura. (Eventually, Big Sur and Monterey was also installed to run other tests, which have been left out of this answer.) When running Ventura, the TV can not be detected when connected through the TV's HDMI jack. This is true when connected to the Mac's HDMI jack or an USB-C jack by an adaptor.\n\nSince detection (and therefore viewing) is possible when booted to Mojave with the same hardware arrangement, I have made the assumption Ventura no longer supports the older HDMI standards.\n\nThe TV also has component inputs, so I tried a HDMI to component adaptor. (The component video standard is analog and uses 5 RCA jacks. Three for HD video and two for stereo audio.) Below is an image of the RCA HDMI to Component Adaptor. I purchased model DHCOPE. There is also a model DHCOPF available, which I assume is newer.\n\nWith this adaptor, I was able to select a resolution of 1080p from Ventura which allows viewing from the TV. I could also boot back to Mojave and still view from the TV at the same resolution of 1080p. However, the adaptor failed to work with Mojave after powering down and restarting.\nSince the TV also has a VGA jack, I tried a HDMI to VGA adaptor. Eventually, the TV is so old that the Mac running Ventura can not read the available VGA resolutions from the TV and therefore does not allow a compatible resolution to be selected. However, I can plug the adaptor to an newer monitor and choose a setting compatible with the TV, then switch the adaptor to the TV and to get a viewable display. Unfortunately, the setting is lost when the power is removed.\n\nNote: If you can not see what setting the Mac is using for a TV or monitor because the setting is incompatible with the TV or monitor, then try using a another Mac to connect through the Screen Sharing application. I was able view and change the setting even when not viewable on the actual TV or monitor.\n\n", "Q: Take different elements of list in Clipboard I define the clipboard as a list of items,\nset clipData to {23, 21, 44, 76}\nset the clipboard to clipData\n\nIn the Applescript application, I'd now like to past the different elements of the clipboard separately.

My new house has a big French window that brings in perfect GPS signal and if I turn off WiFi the location is pretty precise.\nIt is ridiculous that Apple insists on using a vague location of WiFi networks when GPS is more precise. What is even more ridiculous is that Apple assumes personal WiFi routers can never move locations. My iPhone does not even give a single prompt when the discrepancy existed for an entire month. Anything I can do besides ditching this stupid iPhone?\n\nA: Have you changed your own home address on your Contact information in the iPhone?\nLocation finding on phones is assisted-GPS (a combination of WiFi positioning, GPS, and good-old mapping), and while it can make assumptions based on databases of coordinates vs SSIDs, those databases are not unique, and not run by Apple.\nGiving your phone the hint that you've moved would seem to be the first logical step. Eventually it will update.\n", "Q: iPod Touch 6th gen locked; need help At some point during the summer, my youngest sister took my iPod Touch to her dad's house. I just recently found out where it was and got it back. I do not remember my passcode. We have had our wifi changed a couple of times since it went missing so it has no internet connection.\nWhen I plug it into my laptop it says I need to unlock it to use accessories but it charges just fine in a wall outlet. iTunes on my computer can't even detect it and my laptop doesn't even show it as connected under my devices.\nIdeally, I want to be able to access my iPod's photos, i.e. high school graduation and whatnot, photos I never really made a backup of and I now regret. I would love to get them back if at all possible. If it's not, is there a way to reboot my iPod touch or is it just bricked until I miraculously enter the correct 4-digit passcode?\n\nA: You need to remember the passcode.\nThere are ways to get the device back if you don't remember it, but not with the data still intact. Apple will unlock it if you take it to them with proof of ownership, or you can put it in Recovery Mode yourself - https://support.apple.com/HT204306 - but it will be wiped in the process.\n", "Q: How do I get Ansible man pages to work on macOS? (installed with Homebrew) I've installed Ansible on macOS 13.1 (Ventura) with Homebrew. After updating $PATH to include /opt/homebrew/bin so I can execute ansible commands. However, the man pages for Ansible (man ansible, man ansible-galaxy, etc.) do not work. The ansible man pages when installed with Homebrew are located at:\n/opt/homebrew/Cellar/ansible/7.1.0/share/man/man1\nHow can I have the man command on macOS reference these pages?\n\nA: Even though I had eval \"$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)\" in ~/.zprofile and $MANPATH was /opt/homebrew/share/man::, I'm assuming there was some symlinking problems as I noticed after brew uninstall ansible that ansible was still present in /opt/homebrew/bin/ and the ansible command was still symlinked to it.\nAfter doing rm /opt/homebrew/bin/ansible* and brew install ansible, ansible man pages are now working.\n\nA: The variable from which man works out where to look is MANPATH\nFrom the bree manual page https://docs.brew.sh/Manpage#shellenv and your comment on updating PATH I think you have not fully followed the install instructions\n\nConsider adding evaluation of this command’s output to your dotfiles (e.g. ~/.profile, ~/.bash_profile, or ~/.zprofile) with: eval \"$(brew shellenv)\"\n\nTyping brew shellenv will show the updates needed for PATH MANPATH etc if you want to do it manually.\n", "Q: Are the answers to Apple ID security questions 100% useless to a hacker once 2FA has been set up? If my security answers were compromised, do I need to worry about those answers being \"in the wild\" now that I have 2FA set up? (Because now I can't change them). If you can support your answer with official reference/link that would be much appreciated.\n\nA: \ndo I need to worry about those answers being \"in the wild\" now that I have 2FA set up?\n\nYes.  There are two main reasons:\n\n*\n\n*if you used these answers for any other account, there is now a method to compromise those accounts\n\n*2FA is very good, but not foolproof\n\nFrom Apple Support:\n\nTwo-factor authentication is an extra layer of security for your Apple\nID, designed to make sure that you're the only one who can access your\naccount—even if someone else knows your password\n\nNormally, you would reset your passwords using a trusted device, but what if you no longer have access to those trusted devices? This is the scenario a hacker could use to gain access to your account.\nApple would go through a series of manual verifications before they re-enable access to your account. If your email and phone number are known to the attacker, it makes spoofing your identity that much easier.\nIf you used these security questions/answers  anywhere else, you would be best advised to change them.\n\nA: \nIf my security answers were compromised, do I need to worry about those answers being \"in the wild\" now that I have 2FA set up?\n\nIn the context of your Apple account – and specifically the idea that the questions could be answered to reset your password, no.\nWhen you enable two-factor authentication, your security questions cannot be used to modify/reset your account access.\nFrom Apple Support:\n\nTwo-factor authentication is the most secure way to protect your Apple ID. If you haven't set up two-factor authentication for your account, Apple uses security questions to provide you with a secondary method to identify yourself online.\n\n\nIf you don't want security questions or you're concerned about forgetting the answers, you can set up two-factor authentication.\n\nOf course, any personal information could still be used in other ways, i.e. phishing/social engineering. Note that the recovery process for your Apple account is strictly automated and requires access to a phone number or email address to complete.\nIf your attacker could determine this information, they could attack your phone or email accounts and use them to reset your Apple ID. However, this is an involved process, and not directly related to your security questions in particular.\n", "Q: Intermittent black screen Macbook Pro early 2013 I am new here and have a question regarding black screen on a MacBook Pro early 2013. A few weeks ago I updated to Catalina and just some time after the screen went black. It chimes at startup and sometimes the screen lits up with the Apple logo and the startup boot line. When the boot is almost finished the screen blacks out. I can see the login screen and be logged in and work on it by screen sharing from my mac mini. But I can’t see the booting process or go into other modes such as disk utility or restore from the mag mini. I have re-installed catalina with no luck, and I seem not be able to reinstall an older version as mojave. It gives an error that the installer is too old.\nBattery is exchanged and screen cable attachment to the main board has been checked.\nAny clues of what it can be? I would like to install mojave just to be sure that catalina is not doing anything, but I have no more ideas of how to proceed.\nAdditions as of 27 December. I thought I solved it with switching of GPU. I managed to get full startup sequence with functioning screen. But I can’t reproduce it. I am trying gswitch and it does not matter if I use the internal or discrete GPU setting. Same black screen and intermittent pattern of Apple logo visible during startup. I noticed that when it started up normally there was a slight dimming of the Apple logo, at the same time spot as the screen shuts down. So there is something in the startup sequence that does some switching of GPU; either is works with some slight dimming or it gets black.\n\nA: Removed main board ans resoldered the GPU vcore chip. It is now alive. So it was the classic solder joint break. I guess this happens at some time with lead-free solder.\n", "Q: Apple ID password nightmare We have checked a email saying his Apple ID password was changed. At 3:30 pm, I was reading Reddit about iPhone making calls its own, this afternoon I was reading issues about iPhone calls. At 5 pm I was watching YouTube around 5 pm, I was listening to Apple Music for free\nAlright, I got the email saying my Apple ID was used to sign in to iCloud account but i didn’t do it! I was playing Fortnite, all of sudden i received an message from dad saying just told you the time, replied\nI was waiting until dinner\nWhat can you do?\n\nA: This sounds like a phishing attempt.\nBasically, an attacker sends you an email telling you that your account was compromised and provide you a link to logon to a spoofed page to capture your login credentials.\nYou will want to sign into iCloud.  If you can get in, it is likely your credentials were not compromised.  In any event, change the password and enable two factor authentication (2FA) for more security.\nMost importantly, don’t reply to the email or click on any of the links.  If you did, change your password immediately!  If you check the email “From” address, it likely didn’t come from Apple.  If they provided a link, check the URL; if it doesn’t go to the apple.com domain, it’s a definite sign of a phishing attempt.\n", "Q: What exactly are \"git pack objects\"?

I am running macOS Monterey 12.6 (context)\nI have a 500gb Sandisk SSD from 2019. I filled it to 75% with photos from my phone and my cameras over the years. I used lightroom to edit said photos.\nRecently, I was moving and renaming some folders and such on the drive directly. I also added new photos.\nThen, all of a sudden, the stuff in the drive was slow to load. I thought this was a storage issue so I cleared photos to return back to ~75%. Also, lightroom was no longer able to find the photos. Ops, Lightroom wants you to move and rename folders in their software. Ok, I reimported everything into lightroom and I will rename and move some stuff there.\nHowever, an issue  with the drive developed. Long load times for folders to load occurred, sometimes there would be no loading and the graphical paths were blank; further, I was stopped for ejecting the drive because \"an application is using the drive\" and quitting all software would not solve the issue. Other times, the drive would just stop being accessible mid use. Even more, the drive was also not being detected, it would take a couple reboots, disconnects, and reconnects to get the disk detected.\nI put off storing the data elsewhere because I thought I knew how to get the drive recognized: reboot the computer with the drive plugged in and I am good. It worked once but today, it ceased to be recognized. I have tried each of my 4 USB-C drives to no avail.\nSystem report says there is a sandisk SSD plugged in, \nand diskutil also finds it (sometimes but not always) \nWhat is going on? What can I do? :(((((((\nThank you ahead of time.\n\nA: There's an outside chance the enclosure is failing, but equally likely the drive itself.\nYou could try shucking the drive & moving to a new enclosure; but beyond that, I'd be looking at your backup or a data recovery company.\n", "Q: wharf folder on mac I was looking into the contents of my MacBookPros disk. While searching for big files I came across a folder called \"wharf\". It is located in /Users/username/Library/Application Support/FileProvider/763CD908-3C31-43C2-A740-D5736FFFD7ED and is roughly 10GB big. Digging deeper I can go into wharf/wharf/propagate and find two files each roughly 5GB. File names are cryptic to me: \"61403323\" and \"61403321\". Opening them with TextEdit does not give me any hints.

But I would avoid deleting them. They may be removed when the service no longer needs them.\nAlternatively: if you have a backup, you can delete anything in your user account, because you can always restore it if there's a problem.\n", "Q: Bootcamp 'Could not update computer's boot configuration' I own a MacBookPro 16inch 2019 Touchbar i9. I need to install Windows 10 on it as a second OS, but I cannot get it to work. Each time I use Bootcamp it gives me the following error right at the finishing stage of the instalation: 'Could not update computer's boot configuration'.\nSo far I have tried:\n\n*\n\n*6 different Windows ISOs (official newer/older)\n\n*Installing without Bootcamp\n\n*disabling csrutil and disabling that CMD+R security thing\n\n*Completely resetting my MacBook to Factory Settings\n\n*Resetting NVRAM and SMC (once and twice an install)\n\n*First Aiding my Macintosh HD (once and twice an install)\n\n*Using bcdedit and/or diskpart via Shift+F10 while in installer after the error message pops up [commands did not work btw]\n\n*Mounting disk0 and deleting the EFI folder\n\n*The MBR thing is set to 'protectve', not 'hybrid'\n\nAnd every single time I get the same error, except like two times when I installed it off a USB and at the start it said it lacked some boot-critical drivers. At this point I am desperate. I need to install Windows on it before Dec31, but nothing on the Internet seems to work. Any other suggestions, guys?\n\nA: \nThis is not a complete answer, but rather is a start of an answer. I assume more may need to be added later.\n\nApple explicitly states you should download Windows 10 from this website. I know it is possible to use Rufus or Microsoft's media creation tool. However,  doing so may lead to downloading different files from what Apple instructed you to download. So there may exist the possibility that a failure to install could result from not following Apple's instructions.\nFurthermore, you should Safari on your MacBook Pro 16-inch 2019 Touch Bar Core i9 to download the current Windows 10 ISO file. If you have selected in Safari preferences to \"Show develop menu in the menu bar\", then make the User Agent is set to the Default.\nThe proper placement of the Window Support Software on the USB flash drive has not changed since Windows 7. You can read Apple's instructions which are recorded in step 11 of Follow these steps if you downloaded version 5 of Windows Support Software. The Windows Support Software for you Mac probably no longer includes an AutoUnattend.xml file.\n\nNote: There are versions (probably the latest) of the Boot Camp Assistant where the AutoUnattend.xml file is generated and placed by the Boot Camp Assistant in the root folder of the volume containing the Windows 10 installation files before booting from this volume. If necessary, you can extract the file from this location.\n\n", "Q: Discard FileVault 2 key - macOS As far as I'm aware, on iOS when you click the power button 5 times, you effectively nuke the encryption key used to protect the device (which is ultimately derived from your passcode). With regular use, FaceID keeps the key wrapped between unlocks, and thus requiring your passcode is a sign your device needs to derive the key.\nOn macOS is there anything similar? Reading about the Data classes and FileVault support docs, it looks like macOS FileVault only supports NSFileProtectionCompleteUntilFirstUserAuthentication, i.e. it's only safe when shutdown after initial login.\nHow can I nuke the derived macOS encryption key without shutting it down. i.e. wipe the FV encryption key on closing the lid.\nDo I have this right? If so, that's not great.\n\nA: Yes, there's something somewhat similar on macOS.\nOn older versions of macOS, you could make sure that the FileVault encryption key was removed from memory when closing the lid by enabling two features via the Terminal:\nsudo pmset hibernatemode 25\nsudo pmset destroyfvkeyonstandby 1\n\nThis would mean that when you close the lid, the system hibernates (i.e. everything in memory is written out to disk), and the FileVault encryption key is destroyed. Effectively this means that when you open the lid again, you would have to enter your password to unlock the FileVault encryption again.\nIf you choose to go this route, you probably also want to disable PowerNap and otherwise ensure that the system doesn't wake up while in standby mode. If it does, the missing FileVault key would mean that the system cannot run:\nsudo pmset -a powernap 0\nsudo pmset -a standby 0\nsudo pmset -a standbydelay 0\nsudo pmset -a autopoweroff 0\n\nOn modern systems with APFS and T1/T2 there's already protections in place regarding systems in sleep not having the encryption key in main memory.\nNote that even old systems without T1/T2 automatically disable DMA when the laptop is in sleep mode.\n", "Q: iTunes Device Backup not showing I think I may have unintentionally done something wrong on my laptop.\nI am using a Windows 10 laptop and had iTunes version 12.6.5.3 installed.\nI was updating my old iPhone 6s from iOS 9 to iOS 15.  I thought everything was going smoothly when it displayed an error saying iTunes could not update the device unknown error (4). I thought it might be the iTunes version, so I installed the latest version and it updated the iPhone to iOS 15.\nBut I noticed that I could no longer see the apps which I had on my PC.  So, I uninstalled the new version of iTunes and reinstalled version 12.6.3.5.  But then it could not find the iTunes Library.itl file.  After some reading around, I found a recent version (it had many versions) of it in the Previous iTunes Libraries.\nBut now I cannot see the backups in iTunes > Edit > Preferences > Device Backups. I can see them in the MobileSync folder, but not via iTunes.\nI was going to uninstall iTunes 100% and back up the MobileSync folder and the iTunes Media folder which has all the voice memos, etc., and reinstall version 12.6.3.5 to see if this works.\nBut I was hoping someone could shed some light on this, maybe there is a workaround for this.\n\nA: There are two different locations where iTunes stores backups on Windows 10 and 11, for the two different versions of iTunes (direct download from Apple vs the Microsoft App Store.)\nDo you have both of these MobileSync\\Backup folders?\n\n*\n\n*%appdata%\\Apple Computer\\MobileSync\\Backup\n\n*%userprofile%\\Apple\\MobileSync\\Backup\nI'd wager you have the backups in the first one (direct from Apple download) but now have iTunes that uses the second one (from the Microsoft App Store). The uninstall & reinstall is supposed to migrate the folders for you, but it doesn't work sometimes. You can try closing iTunes, moving the folders from the one Backup folder to the other, and then reopen iTunes and see if that helps.\n\nA: I think I may have solved it. I uninstalled iTunes and everything associated with it. Restarted the PC. Then installed iTunes 12.6.5.3 again. This time it seemed to work. I can see the back ups again.\n", "Q: How to change the initial login screen background in macOS Ventura? After upgrading my macOS to Ventura, the initial login screen background, before selecting a user, is set to Chroma Red, and I can't figure out how to change it. When a user is selected, the default screen background of Ventura is shown, which can be changed by adding an image to the /Library/Caches/Desktop Pictures folder. The question is, how to change the initial login background?\n\nA: It is possible, but there are prerequisites that are not advised for most users:\n\n*\n\n*FileVault disabled\n\n*SIP (System Integrity Protection) disabled\n\n*SSV (Signed System Volume) disabled\n\nIf you do these things, and leave it that way, then yes, it can be done.\nThe image in question is /System/Library/Desktop Pictures/Ventura Graphic.heic.\nIf the prerequisites are completed (from Terminal window entered after Recovery reboot, csrutil disable, and then csrutil authenticated-root disable, and reboot), you can replace the above with an equally-sized (6016x6016) HEIC file (using Preview will do, just square/crop it up and Tools->Adjust Size options to get size right). The filename must be the same (copy over the original with replacement image file of same name).\nBut in order to make this change, the /System volume must be mounted for edit, because /System is read-only. Create a mount point (mkdir -p -m777 ~/sysmnt) and mount /System there (e.g., sudo mount -o no browse -t apfs /dev/disk3s1 ~/sysmnt); you will need to know which disk slice is your system volume - use diskutil list to find the correct disk slice for mount. Enter the mounted volume (cd ~/sysmnt), and make edits in /System paths relative to this mount point.\nWhen edits are done, 'bless' the modified /System volume, so it is persistent at next reboot (for Intel box use: sudo bless --folder ~/sysmnt/System/Library/CoreServices --bootefi --create-snapshot , for Apple silicon [M1/M2] use: sudo bless --mount ~/sysmnt/System/Library/CoreServices --setBoot --create-snapshot). reboot.\nThe default desktop background can likewise be changed (6016x6016 JPEG file rather than HEIC - can use File->Export from Preview of same image from above) at /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/SystemDesktopAppearance.framework/Versions/A/Resources/DefaultBackground.jpg .\nThese changes will remain, and function as expected, until the security features disabled as prereqs are restored - doing so will wipe out these changes, and the Apple defaults will be restored. As such, it can serve as an exercise to prove the concept - it does work - but not recommended to leave it this way.\nApple should just allow these changes from System Settings, and avoid this nonsense.\n", "Q: iTunes not showing music ripped from CD I have hundreds of ripped music CD files on an external drive and iTunes currently points to that library and file location. I've had this library since Yosemite and now run High Sierra. The issue is iTunes version 12.8.x doesn't seem to access these files directly and all of the playlists are missing (I have iTunes Library.itl library files dating back years I can swap out but none seem to work). All the ripped songs appear in the iTunes Music Library browser as before, but they all have a cloud download icon next to them in iTunes. How do I get iTunes just to show and play the ripped files from the hard drive without having to download them from icloud or stream them. I'm currently off-grid so don't have to broadband with lots of bandwidth.\n\nA: After endless futile searches I found that the iTunes library for 12.8.x uses an xml file to reference the original music files. For some reason this file referenced the ~ user library and not the external drive where the music files are located. I did a search and replace in BBEdit and it relinked to the local files on relaunch.\n", "Q: How to make Finder find files on a NAS reliably? I have an NAS (which are Synology and ASUS if it matters, the one having issue is ASUS), and say, if I have a file\nPublic/Lists/List of Tesla movies.txt\n\nNow if I use Finder on Mac with Monterey macOS 12.5, and go to Public and search using Tesla and \"filenames containing\", it cannot find the file, which is obviously there when I open up the folder Lists.\nIf I use in the Bash or Zsh command prompt (Terminal):\nfind /Volumes/Public -iname '*tesla*'\n\nthen it'd now find the file.  However, I may not go through this step using Bash every time, but take the Finder's search result as the answer.  The fact that find can find it but Finder cannot find it suggests it is not the issue with the NAS.  So how can I make Finder more reliable and able to find a file by filename?\n(I checked the Settings -> Spotlight -> Privacy and that network folder is not part of the \"do not index\" folder and it never was... and I don't think a pre-built index is used to find files. Besides, I don't know if Finder and Spotlight are related in this search operation).\nUpdate: P.S. the one having issue right now is the ASUS one\n\nA: Spotlight needs an index to search in, it doesn‘t index network drives though (technically it can‘t because it‘s not aware of all files changes in a shared network drive). So to enable Spotlight on a NAS you need to run indexing locally on the NAS itself.\nHow this works depends on the NAS involved. On Synology/DSM there are Universal Search and Indexing Service which can be enabled, for other NAS you may need to consult the manual or check with the vendor.\n", "Q: Cmd + Shift + T behaves differently in Safari Recently I started to use Safari instead Opera and if I accidentally close a window in Opera I press Cmd+Shift+T and the window reopens.\nBut when I do the same in Safari a window reopens and closes and deletes from history.

If not, change it in System Settings > Keyboard > Keyboard Shortcuts > App Shortcuts:\n\n*\n\n*Application: select \"Safari.app\"\n\n*Menu Title: type \"Reopen Last Closed Tab\" - from the \"History\" menu\n\n*Keyboard Shortcut: press Cmd+Shift+T\n", "Q: How can I set the low power mode to \"Only On Battery\" programmatically?

So:\nfunction battery-low-power-mode-enable {\n    sudo pmset -b lowpowermode 1\n    # enables lowpowermode only when on battery\n}\n\nfunction battery-low-power-mode-disable {\n    sudo pmset -a lowpowermode 0\n    # disables lowpowermode for ALL power sources\n}\n\n", "Q: iPad keyboard is now small The keyboard on my iPad has just started floating and so is now much smaller and very difficult to use.\nHow do I get it back to go full size on the bottom of the screen. Note the way described in this Apple document https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210758 does NOT work. Spreading fingers on the keyboard does nothing. Ideally some non gesture way as I find  gestures are impossible to remember.\nSecondly how can I stop this from ever happening again?\n\nA: When the small keyboard is floating, there's a grabbar at the bottom of the small keyboard. Touch and hold it, the small keyboard can now be dragged. Now drag it to the middle-bottom of the screen. The keyboard should turn into a big grey rectangle. When you release it, the keyboard \"docks\" to the bottom and becomes normal again.\n\nA: Two finger pinch-to-zoom “in” (fingers move apart) on the keyboard. It will expand to the large one again.\n", "Q: Time delayed text animation with macOS Keynote I want to achieve a very common animation with macOS keynote as described bellow:\nA phrase consists of few words to appear on the screen word by word.\nThe first word appears first, starting from a little bellow of its original position and then moves to its original position.\nThen after a short delay, the 2nd word follows the same kind of animation.\nThen after a short delay the 3rd word, and so on.\nFor a demo, this video has a similar animation. The phrase Who is eligible for a handle? animates there like what I have described above. The link URL was captured at (almost) the correct time of the animation.\n\nA: Maybe I'm misunderstanding what you want, but this seems like a simple application of the \"Fade and Move\" build-in animation:\n\nI've set it to a slight delay between steps (2s) moved from bottom to top, and you want to animate each word, rather than the default \"by object\" (which is the whole phrase).\nYou can control the distance you want and the direction (here bottom to top).\n\n", "Q: Use back function in iphone with one hand I want to use back function in iphone in all apps with one hand. I can't swipe from left edge of the phone because I can't reach out to it with my finger. I also didn't want to use swipe down function. I need some way do this. On Android there was a separate button for back function. How can I do this? Maybe some app can do this?\n\nA: There are no “buttons” on an iPhone screen; this is by design.\nI tested several apps on my iPhone (13 mini) and none require a swipe from the left edge rightward to “go back.”  This can be achieved with a rightward swipe from the center of the screen.\nOn Apple products, it’s more about the gesture than the actual location where you take the action. Other than some very specific gestures like opening Control Center, unlocking the phone, and seeing notifications requiring the gesture to begin at a particular location, things like navigation or zoom are recognized anywhere on the screen.\n\nGestures are a key way for people to interact with their touchscreen devices, eliciting a close personal connection with content and enhancing the sense of directly manipulating onscreen objects.\n\nThis is from the iOS Human Interface Guidelines published by Apple.  More specifically, under Best Practices it states:\n\nIn general, respond to gestures in ways that are consistent with other apps. People expect most gestures to work the same regardless of their current context.\n\nIt sounds as though the developers of the apps you are interested in/use have strayed from this design tenet.  From your comment that it’s pointless to contact the developers means they will never receive the necessary feedback to improve their apps.\nIt’s highly unlikely you’ll find an app to fix what other apps should have implemented in the first place.\n", "Q: Apple Watch doesn’t show Race Route I have an Apple Watch Series 8 with iOS 9.2 and I haven’t been able to get the Race Route feature to work.\nI’ve run the same route several times using the Workout app. When I open the Activities app on the iPhone I can see the map and my route on previous runs. But when I select Outdoor Run on my watch and filter to Route, no routes show up.\nI’ve restarted both the phone and the watch and made sure I’m at the start of my route before opening the Workout app.\nUpdate: I suspected Apple may be sensitive to tiny variations in my route, particularly in the part that’s on a trail. So I tested yesterday by running the same 0.5 mile route on a sidewalk by a road known to Maps. It still wasn’t picked up.\nAnything else I might be missing?\n\nA: After updating my phone to iOS 9.2 the route now shows up. I thought I had already updated but the installation was stuck.\n", "Q: Apple Display/UI Scaling I am a new owner of a M1 MacBook Pro and a long time Windows user and I have a problem with how the text is displayed on my screen.\nThe Mac's screen itself looks fine, but when I connected it to my usual 43\" 4K display (LG 43UN700-B) I noticed the horrendous lack of proper scaling.\nI tried to do some research and found this post, from which gathered there is no UI scaling in macOS (Ventura) and I either have to accept everything beeing too big with 1080p resolution to use integer scaling or use native resolution, which looks blurry on my display on macOS (I suspect this could be due to lack of sub-pixel antialiasing, but I tried turning it on via terminal to no avail).\nTo summarize:\n\n*\n\n*Is there any way to change the size of UI elements without changing the screen resolution (e.g. setting display scaling to 125% on Windows)? I don't mind using terminal, another window manager (if that's a thing on macOS) or some weird hacks.\n\nAlso buying a screen with higher DPI is not an option since it would mean buying a 8K screen   which is not really a thing now.\n\nA: \nIs there any way to change the size of UI elements without changing\nthe screen resolution?\n\nThe Scaling options on macOS exist for the express function of changing the size of UI elements. The default Retina scaling on a laptop's screen makes everything 2x as big as it would otherwise be, using the full pixel resolution of the display.\nThe resolution doesn't change: just the 'zoom level'. Don't be fooled by 'Looks like 1080p'.\nYour display has a pixel density of 102ppi, which is very low, and so you're always going to see some lack of smoothness.  For one reason or another, macOS has removed the code for sub-pixel rendering, so displays of this sort don't look great.\nI would have thought that native resolution would give the best results. Use any kind of scaling is, as you say, going to make things enormous. If you really find the native display both too small and too blurry, you could try a 'non-integer' scaling value, maybe 2560 x 1440.\n\nbuying a screen with higher DPI is not an option since it would mean\nbuying a 8K screen\n\nA 27\" 4K display would show a significant improvement, at 163ppi.\n", "Q: How do I connect a my Logitech unifying receiver keyboard/mouse to my macOS 12 mac? I can't connect my logitech unifying receiver keyboard (K520) to my macOS 12 mac. There is no macOS 12 download for the unifying software and the v10 unifying software version does not work. It fails to see my keyboard when I turned the keyboard off and on again.\n\nA: Try the new \"Logi Bolt\" software.

Or does one just install JDK?'\nOpenJDK works with LibreOffice?\n\nA: This question is bordering on off topic, but to address the Apple relevant question….\n\nWhich JRE does Catalina require? Or does one just install JDK?'\n\nCatalina doesn’t require a JRE. macOS has no need for a Java Runtime Environment out of the box. You would install a JRE/JDK based on your  needs/requirements.\nNow, since you mentioned LibreOffice, a quick look at their System Requirements for macOS tells you what you need:\n\nDue to an issue, there are the following restrictions with Java: on macOS 10.10 and newer, JRE isn't found, JDK is required\n\nEmphasis mine\nYou need the JDK.\nOpenJDK is the Open Source implementation of Oracle’s Java Platform, Standard Edition. It’s the same thing as the fully licensed Java Platform. So, in short, it works with all Java apps including LibreOffice.\n", "Q: Check which files are currently syncing to iCloud Drive Is it possible to see which files are currently syncing to iCloud Drive (in the same way you can with OneDrive, Dropbox and others)? I keep seeing this sort of thing in my Finder status bar:\n\nHowever, I've not changed any files recently, and certainly not a large 226.8 MB file. How can I determine what is currently being synced?\nTo be clear, I'm hoping to see something like this (this is what OneDrive shows):\n\nThis tells me that it is currently doing a 407.2 MB upload, but also specifically that it is the file test.mp4 which is being uploaded. Seeing this would be really handy to understand why it was doing something (e.g. “oh, I did change that file” vs “that file definitely hasn't been changed, why is iCloud uploading it again?”).\n\nA: System Preferences > iCloud you can see which files are synchronized in your iCloud. Or, in your Finder, you have your favorites (Download, Desktop..) and underneath iCloud, inside you can see your files that are synced. Maybe that answers your question.\n", "Q: iTerm2 disable full screen keyboard shortcut Any way to disable fn(Globe)-F keyboard shortcut for full screen?

I use my mac with admin user, which is the only user on the device. I just want to restrict user creation from the \"User and Groups\" in System Settings or Preference. Or even if the admin can use \"Add Account\" option, the newly created user should not be accessible. (Not from the GUI at least.)\n\nA: First method:\nThe command below will disable the Users & Groups preference pane (for all users including admin). Tested on Ventura 13.1 and Catalina.\nsudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.systempreferences DisabledPreferencePanes -array \"com.apple.preferences.users\"\n\nTo undo:\nsudo defaults delete /Library/Preferences/com.apple.systempreferences DisabledPreferencePanes\n\nSecond Method:\nThere is a more robust method that leverages .mobileconfig Configuration Profiles (see rtrouton/profiles • GitHub for an example which blocks access to iCloud preferences). This requires the machine to be enrolled in an MDM such as Jamf, Addigy, etc. One can also manually create/deploy the profiles using Apple Configurator.\nA benefit to using Profiles is that the settings can be targeted at specific Users instead of the \"sledgehammer\" approach in the first method.\n", "Q: How to stream analog audio input to AirPods via Mac? There's a case where I need to play audio from software on my Mac, but also simultaneously from a Line In analog audio source using the 3.5mm audio jack on a 2021 MacBook Pro. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem the new machines still have an optical audio input, but the goal here is to hear the mixed audio from both the Mac and the external source on AirPods paired to the Mac.\nSo, a couple of questions:\n\n*\n\n*Can the 3.5mm port function as a Line In, or only as a Microphone?\n\n*Is it possible that I can stream all system audio (including the external source) to AirPods (or theoretically the built-in speakers) while also hearing system software? Perhaps using a third-party app or some Homebrew hackery?\n\n... Any thoughts here would be appreciated! Thanks!\n\nA: According to the official Apple Technical Specifications, the 3.5mm port is a headphone (stereo speakers and microphone) port only.\nIf you need multiple sources, you need a proper audio interface like a Behringer mixer.  This type of device will allow you to connect multiple analog and/or digital inputs so that you can better process them.  It has an internal DAC (digital analog converter) so that everything your Mac receives is digital and all digital outputs can be converted to analog for headphones/external speakers\n", "Q: To recover disk space,should I \"Erase and reinstall macOS\" , or \"Erase macOS\"? My MBP is a 2016 Model Identifier: MacBookPro13,3; it has a 500 GB drive. I've upgraded the OS from Mojave in the beginning, to Monterey just recently. Everything seems to be working as it should, but my SSD is near the limit (see screenshot below).\nI don't understand how I have gotten to nearly 350 GB. Someone suggested that the upgrades, and \"general usage\" may lead to a lot of cruft in the file system. At any rate, I removed about 80 GB of data earlier today after copying it to another drive. The totals shown below are after removing the files I wanted to keep.\nI found a procedure from the macos User Guide named \"Erase and reinstall macOS\", but at the bottom of that page it has another option for Erase your Mac.\nI have several apps I don't need, and Desktop and Documents are \"in the cloud\". I'd be happy to still have things like my iCloud account, but will gladly forego that if it frees up 30 GB or more.\nWhich of these two options will result in the most free space on my SSD? Are there other pros & cons to be considered?\n\n\nA: Lots to unpack here. First, if you do want to 'wipe clean' your Mac, then you should use the Erase Assistant, as outlined in the Apple Support document. (In later OSes, you can Erase all Content from the OS Settings.)\nThere's nothing wrong with the disk format itself, so leave that alone. (Similarly, there's no point in erasing the OS itself, as it is immutable.)\nThe best way to deal with a full disk is to use an app like OmniDiskSweeper (there are others, but this one is free), which will show you a listing of each folder on your disk, sorted by size. You can then drill down and find which files are using the most space.\nThe biggest use of space is likely to be: user stuff. You might have old installers of apps still left in Downloads; otherwise, it will be documents, videos, music, photos, etc.\nSome apps can be very large (MS Office apps are over 1Gb each). Things like Logic and MainStage have large libraries of support files in /Library/Application Support (NB: this is the root level Library, not the User library.)\nOtherwise, the dangers of CRUFT!!! are largely overstated. Sure, if you've deleted some apps, then there might be some configuration files left in the user Library (e.g. ~/Library/Application Support).\nI would advise against using apps like CleanMyMac or other 'cleaning' tools. At best, they miss stuff; at worst, they delete things that they shouldn't. Emptying caches, for example, is a largely fruitless exercise, as they will just refill again.\nTBH, 150GB free on a 500GB disk is more than sufficient.\n", "Q: Why do some accessory brands have pin 3, pin 2-3 or pin 6-7 removed from Apple's Lightning connector? As you know, the Apple lightning cable has 8 pins on each side, but some accessory brands have some production of the same lightning cable as Apple but its have fewer than 8 pins. They have removed pin 3, pin 2-3, or pin 6-7, so the cables can be charged for iPhones (explain here), but I worry about the transmission data. How can you explain that to me?\n\n\nA: \nWhy do some accessory brands have pin 3, pin 2-3 or pin 6-7 removed from Apple's Lightning connector?\n\nShort answer:  Cost\nPins 2,3,6 and 7 and the pins used for data transfer.  If a manufacturer leaves out these pins, it’s because they are using a cable with fewer conductors.  Fewer conductors means less cost.\n\nBy reducing the number of conductors, they make “charge only” cables where there is no data transmission. If they leave out only a single pair (2-3 or 6-7) you’ll only get data transmission in one orientation of the connector rather than both.\nStay away from these cables; they are inexpensive because they are made cheaply.  They can have faults or wear prematurely causing shorts which could damage your device.\nGet a MiFi certified cable.  A brand I am partial to is Anker; they cost more than generic “Chineesium” cables, but you’ll get better performance and reliability.\n", "Q: How to remove old PDF Services in read-only file system?

Corruption of portable media is common, especially if you are moving it around, mounting and un-mounting, in and out of your bag, hot and cold, etc.\nIf you really need the files, I'd recommend a reputable file recovery utility before doing anything else to the volume, and in the future, don't rely on portable media for critical files.\n", "Q: Transfer files \"directly\" from Android to iPhone My friend (iPhone 13 I guess) and I (Pixel 7) want to share photos and videos we took with each other.\nWe use some messaging app which allows it. But it's a hassle selecting and transferring.\nI'd like not to use another service if I don't have to.\nI wondered if there's a way to directly transfer images and video.\nI tried it with cable with my work iphone SE. At first Android recognized it as storage. But then all data transfer options are gone and it can only be charged.\nIs there any method to share files either via cable or wirelessly via Bluetooth, NFC, Wifi?\n\nA: There are a few different options for transferring files directly from an Android device to an iPhone:\n\n*\n\n*By using third-party applications:\nSHAREit, Xender, Send Anywhere, Feem, Zapya & more.\nThese apps typically use a WiFi connection to transfer the files and support a wide variety of file types.\n\n\n*By using cloud storage applications:\nGoogle Drive, iCloud, DropBox, Box, & more.\nYou can upload the files to the cloud and share access using invite or share to all.\n\n\n*Social media apps:\nTelegram, WhatsApp & more.\nShare with more flexibility.\n\n\n*By Cable:\nTo transfer files directly from an Android device to an iPhone using a cable, you'll need a USB-C to Lightning cable.\nHere's how to do it:\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect one end of the cable to your Android device and the other end to your iPhone.\n\n*On your Android device, go to \"Settings\" > \"Storage\" > \"Files\" and select the files you want to transfer.\nTap the \"Share\" button and select \"Send files\".\n\n*On your iPhone, the \"Files\" app should automatically open. Select \"Import\" to import the files from your Android device.\n\n*If the \"Files\" app doesn't open automatically, you can find it on your iPhone's home screen.\n\n\nA: The easiest way to accomplish this is with shared photo albums in iCloud and whatever the Google equivalent is (Google Drive?). OneDrive and DropBox support this as well.\nYou can’t use a direct cable, but there are USB flash drives with Lightning connectors. You can share the flash drive between phones if you really need an offline solution.\nFinally, you can sync both phones to a computer to share the photos\n", "Q: Interpreting networkQuality JSON output If you run networkQuality -c you get a nice JSON output suitable for later processing.

I use RealVNC to connect to an intel-based iMac, but it cannot wake it up if it is asleep after long inactivity. Yes, I don't change the setting to prevent from sleeping but only leave 'Wake for network access' on.\nHowever, the same works perfectly to connect a sleeping Mac Studio. This obviously has the merit of letting the machine rest and saving energy.\nBoth 'server' machines use WiFi and the other machine used to control them is not necessarily within the same local network. The 'server' machines do not have a public IP addresses.\nI tried to compare the settings like in 'Energy Saver' between the two host machines, but still have no clue.\nWhen testing this, I noticed that I still can connect to the iMac right after (like 10 seconds) I manually put it to sleep. If I wait a few minutes, it does not work.\n\nA: The Screen Sharing application included with macOS should be able to wake a sleeping Mac. Apple does provide instructions at the website Share the screen of another Mac. Below is an example of where I use screen sharing without needing an user to give permission at the remote server Mac. Here, I assume screen sharing is enabled on the server.\n\n\n\n\n\nClient\nServer\n\n\n\n\nMac\n2011 iMac\n2018 Mac mini\n\n\nmacOS\nHigh Sierra\nMojave\n\n\n\n\nThe steps are given below.\n\n*\n\n*Start by right clicking on the Finder icon on the dock and selecting \"Connect to Server...\", as shown below.\n\n\n\n*In the \"Connect to Server\" popup, enter the server ip address (or name.domain) preceeded by vnc://, as shown below. Next, select the Connect button.\n\n\n\n*You should get a popup similar to the one shown below.\n\n\n\n*When the popup shown below appears, enter a username and password of an account on the server, as shown below. Next, select the Connect button.\n\n\n\n*You should get a popup similar to the one shown below.\n\n\n\n*Choose the radio button which begins with \"Log in as yourself:\". Next, select the Connect button.\n\n\n\n*You should get a popup similar to the one shown below.\n\n\n\n*The following log in screen appeared. Since I know Ron Janzen is currently logged in at the server Mac, I can screen share by selecting this user.\n\n\n\n*After selecting Ron Janzen, I am prompted for Ron Janzen's password, as shown below.\n\nAfter entering Ron Janzen's password, I am allowed to screen share. For privacy purposes, an image has been omitted.\n\nRemote Log In without Screen Sharing\nIn step 8 above, I could have selected an user which is not logged in. Doing so would allow me to access a remote desktop without interfering with the current user logged in at the server Mac. For example, if I selected David Anderson in step 8 above, then the password for David Anderson's account on the server would be asked for, as shown below.\n\nAfter entering the password, the window shown below appeared.\n\nNote: the server Mac has two displays. After selecting to only view the first display and selecting scaling, the following window is shown.\n\n", "Q: Apple Mail sometimes not showing content of e-mail I'm using Apple Mail 16.0 (3696.120.41.1.1) on a MacBook Air (13-inch, 2017) with macOS Monterey 12.6.2 (21G320).\nI don't know when it started but there's a problem I have since some months:\nSometimes when I click on an e-mail in the list of e-mails, no matter in which folder (inbox, sent …), the header (from, to, subject, date) gets shown as usual but the e-mail content is empty, just white space.\nThis happens with all my e-mail accounts. All of them are IMAP accounts. All these e-mails are already downloaded and often only a few KB in size. It's the same with e-mails with and without attachment. There's no This message has no content message or similar. This also happens when I disable internet connection. When that happens the content preview in the e-mails list is visible as usual as well as the e-mail header. Only the mail content is blank.\nSometimes I just have to wait a few seconds to see the content. Sometimes I can make the content visible by clicking on another e-mail and then back to that e-mail. But often I have to restart Apple Mail.\nThis not only happens to one e-mail but often to multiple e-mails simultaneously. I click from e-mail to e-mail and they all show that behavior.\nRebuild didn't help. Also reinstalling macOS (keep data but reinstall macOS) didn't help. I even completely erased the system, made a fresh install of macOS and then restored data from a backup. (I'm pretty sure my problem would be solved if I'd make a fresh install and then import data and make the settings manually instead of restoring from backup but I cannot do that currently.)\nDo you have any idea how to solve that problem? Is there any error log I can check?\n\nA: Unfortunately, this is not unheard of and there's a number of reasons this can happen, such as:\n\n*\n\n*Your Mailbox(es) are bloated with years and years worth of email data\n\n*an unresponsive macOS at the time (usually due to issues with Mail Data, but also possibly for unrelated reasons)\n\n*a somewhat corrupted inbox\n\n*macOS being unable to find (or having delays in finding) the relevant message data\n\n*unintended consequences due to blocked users or Mail rules\n\nRebuilding mailboxes was certainly a good place to start. Since that didn't resolve your issue, I would try manually reindexing your mail data.\nTo do this, follow these steps:\n\n*\n\n*Quit Mail\n\n*Go to Finder\n\n*Press shiftcommandG\n\n*After the Go to Folder window appears, type (or copy and paste) the following file path: ~/Library/Mail/V9/MailData\nNOTE: For users not running macOS Monterey, the \"V9\" part of the above file path will be different - e.g. for macOS Ventura it will be V10, for macOS Big Sur it will be V8.\n\n\n*Press return\n\n*The MailData window appears, containing a number of files and folders relating to the Mail app\n\n*Make sure you sort the view by Name (if it isn't already)\n\n*Make a backup of the Envelope Index file and the ExternalUpdates.storedata file (copying them to your Desktop is fine)\n\n*You'll probably see other files starting with \"Envelope Index\" and \"ExternalUpdates\" - if so, trash these files\n\n*Open Mail again\n\n*When prompted to re-import your messages, click OK. (Note: You may get a warning that the index is damaged and that Mail has to quit.)\n\n*Be patient while Mail imports your messages. This can take anywhere from a few minutes to a number of hours, depending on how much data you actually have stored locally on your Mac.\n\nOnce complete, test Mail to see if this has resolved your issue.\nNOTE: If you have any unexpected problems, repeat Steps 1 to 6 above and then copy back the files you backed up at Step 8.\n", "Q: Where do screenshots go now that I've installed Ventura?

I was going to suggest that perhaps there was some automation set up that was moving them quickly.  I have Hazel do this, but after a period of time and only if they remain with the name unchanged.  By default, the screenshots will be saved to your desktop.  Someone mentioned that the screenshot will appear temporarily in the lower right corner before being saved to the location it is going to be saved.

So ideally I'll end up with:\nTitleA 1234\nTitleB 5678\n\nBonus would be to also sort the final txt file alphabetically. But I could settle for pasting it into Excel and sorting there etc. although sorting in script would be better if not too dificult.\nAm I on the right track at all? I've tried all different combinations of this workflow and it feels like there's a fundamental flaw with it.\n\nA: sed is not very well suited for multiline processing, but it's easy to accomplish with awk:\n$ awk '/^The delivery of/ { title = $4 }\n       /^The barcode for/ { print title, $6 }' File1.txt File2.txt | sort -u\nTitleA 1234\nTitleB 5678\n\nTo integrate this into a Folder Action, create an Automator Folder Action workflow with one \"Run Shell Script\" action.\n\nYou didn't describe what you want to do with the output, so either capture it with an additional action or add > ~/my-output.txt to store it in your User directory.\n\nA: The operating system comes with lots of small tools that manipulate text. In this example we chain rev (reverse), cut, paste, and sort together with pipes.\nrev file1.txt file2.txt | cut -d' ' -f1 | rev | paste -d' ' - - | sort -u\n\n\n*\n\n*rev reverses each line of text in the files\n\n*cut grabs the first \"field\" of text on each line\n\n*rev again reverses the text from the output of cut\n\n*paste glues every two lines into a single line\n\n*sort removes duplicates\n\nThis solution is only a demonstration and would be better done with awk or perl\n\nA: I think that you're seeing those results because you are working with the text files in addition to their contents.\nI have no interest in working with folder actions but if you add the following actions to a new folder action they should work with text files when they're added to the folder.\n\n*\n\n*Combine text files - combines the eight paragraphs from the two files.\n\n\n*Run shell script - sed -e 's/The delivery of //g' -e 's/The barcode for this is //g'\nRemoves the two specified strings\n\n\n*Run shell script - sort -u\nSorts results and removes duplicate lines\n\n\n*Run applescript - Pairs the title with the barcode\non run {input, parameters}\n    set paraList to items of input\n    set paraLength to ((length of paraList) / 2)\n    set output to {}\n    repeat with x from 1 to paraLength\n        set end of output to item (x + paraLength) of paraList & space & item x of paraList\n    end repeat\n    return output\nend run\n--> {\"TitleA 1234\", \"TitleB 5678\"}\n\n\n*\n\n*New TextEdit Document - should deposit desired text in new document\n\nTitleA 1234\nTitleB 5678\n\nWhat it does:\nThe first action gathers the text (as paragraphs) from the files added. The first shell script runs two sed commands which remove your unwanted strings. The second shell script sorts the remaining text and its -u option removes any duplicate lines.\nThe run applescript action basically breaks the items into two groups, loops through them and pairs the titles and barcodes. Finally, the results are deposited in a new text document. If you drop additional documents at once that follow the same format, then they should be reflected in the results.\nNB for testing purposes, I used a workflow containing the above actions but with the following at the top to feed 'file1.txt', etc… to the 'combine' action.\n\n*\n\n*Get selected finder items - the two (or more) text files\n\n", "Q: Where is the URI of a downloaded file stored?

When I shutdown, press the power button and hold the D (or even Option D) key nothing happens, that is the system boots in the usual way.\nI'm running without devices attached, except for the power cord. I suppose that Internet Diagnostics would detect available WiFi and then ask for a password (as I saw it on other macs).\nThanks.\nPS I must say that I've also run the procedures to reset SMC and NVRAM and I'm doubtful whether something happened.\n\nA: After a number of attempts to reset the various resettable things, there has been no way to run diagnostics locally, but Option-D started diagnostics remotely, connecting to the WiFi.\n", "Q: How to check if a macOS TimeMachine backup is encrypted? Is there a way to check if a TimeMachine backup is encrypted on macOS Ventura 13.1?\nIn the UI it's not visible:\n\nIf I check the files on the network drive I see this:\n\nI have no idea how to check if this is encrypted. Maybe it's possible to check via command line?\n\nA: For an external USB attached APFS volume you can right-click on the external disk in the Finder, in the \"faze's-MBP\" location (or however your machine is named) that gives a list of all volumes.\nIf it's encrypted, you will see an option to decrypt, and vice-versa.\nHowever, if I read your images correctly, you are using a networked sparse bundle. From my own experiments I found that if you create them directly on the NAS they must be HFS+, and encryption options must be set at creation. For me, the option to encrypt after the creation does not appear.\nSo it would seem this answer will not satisfy for a sparse bundle TM volume. But it can still be checked.\nIf you are asked for a password when the volume is mounted then obviously it's encrypted. If you are not asked, then it may still be encrypted if your keychain contains a stored password for the volume. Open Keychain Access and search for the name of the TM volume (or search for 'encrypted volume password' for all) to check. If none found, then your volume is probably unencrypted.\nOf course, this works for a USB attached volume also.\nNow, re. the files you are seeing on your network device, they are the control files within the sparse bundle that make up the sparse bundle itself. The volume image is encoded within the files you find in the bands subfolder, and of course, if encryption is enabled, then it's them that are encrypted. You cannot browse the sparse bundle files and expect to see your original data. That is only visible when the sparse bundle is mounted on a macOS machine. Of course it is not recommended to modify or move these files. Normally on a macOS machine you would not normally see those files, as they're hidden in a package, but your network device has no concept of the package so they are presented as a folder.\n", "Q: How can I monitor the energy impact of peripheral devices connected to my Macbook? How can I monitor the energy impact of peripheral devices connected to my Macbook? I want to see if my external HDD is draining my battery or not.\n\nA: If the external HDD is connected solely through USB (bus powered) it is most certainly drawing current. If the HD inside is constantly spinning, the drive is pulling a constant current. If you set \"Put hard disks to sleep when possible\" in the Energy Save System preference, and the disk is actually spun down, only the current needed to maintain the external drive's electronics are drawing from your laptop.\nA typical external HDD draws 4 watts of energy. This 4 watt figure is from LaCie Support. Text below extracted from this page.\n\"Mobile drives are commonly referred to as \"Bus-Powered\" devices. They don't typically require an external power supply, and are powered by the ports on a computer. Most mobile drives require approximately 4 watts of energy to run. Most computers produce this, so it isn't usually a problem.\nMultiple Drives\nIt is possible to run multiple bus powered drives, but note the amount of power taken. Two drives takes the power requirement to 8 watts, which few computers can do comfortably. Also, a laptop will quickly have its battery drained, and that can cause an interruption in communication with the hard disk (which can translate to data loss)\"\n\n*\n\n*Edited to add:\nThis USB power meter device can be used to measure voltage from 3.7V-30V, and measure current from: 0-4A.\n\n", "Q: Delete entire selection in Iterm2 I'm looking for a way to select a block of text in Iterm2 and delete it.\nSomething like the following example, where I delete a selection of text in the middle of a line.\n> python3 main.py bad arguments good arguments\n> python3 main.py ■■■■■■■■■■■■■ good arguments\n(click some key...)\n> python3 main.py good arguments\n\nI know there are shortcuts to \"Delete line after cursor\", but that would not work here since I don't want to delete the entire line after the cursor.\nIs there any feature like this in Iterm2? It's exactly the same as an average text editor which lets you select and delete text within a line.\nNote: I'm using zsh for my shell\n\nA: This is not related to ITerm2; it has to do with your shell (Bash, Zsh, etc.) and/or editor. For all intents and purposes, iTerm2 is nothing more than a facilitator - the interface -to the CLI (shell) into your system; it’s not a text editor.\nThat said, Bash, for example, does have some rudimentary editing capabilities.  For example, OptionD (Option = Meta or Alt) will allow you to delete from the cursor position to the end of a word.\nIf you’re using an editor like vi, it has its own commands to edit text.  For example, D D deletes an entire line,  D Space deletes to the next word, and D 5 deletes exactly 5 characters.\nAll of this is a function of the shell and/or editor, not iTerm2\nWhat you need to remember is that while you can use your mouse to select and copy text; that text is not being held in memory like a document in TextEdit would.  It’s being held in a scrollback buffer.  Think of it as a running paper tape of everything on the screen.  Yes, you can look at it and even copy selections,  but you can’t edit it.\n\nA: ESC D is kill-word and CTRL-W is kill-word-backward in zsh.\n(assuming the shell is configured for emacs mode)\nAll documented in man zshzle.\n", "Q: Where to save files that won't be Desktop or Documents? I was told by Apple Support to hold my computer's cloud drive on pause while I organize my files. They saw how I had many files on Desktop and Documents. I have now somewhat organized them into folders so they will be easy to move, but I'm unsure where is a good location to move them to if I'd like to keep them on my computer rather than an external drive, although I did move some to a flash drive.\nHere is where I moved them to:\n\nIs this a good location for when the Macbook Pro restarts and it won't take as long as it would if it were on Desktop? Where are other directories I should not keep many files in (Downloads, maybe)? I already have the Trash set to clear after 30 days. I also have a paid iCloud Drive plan with great storage space left so the iCloud Drive's storage space limit is not a problem in this case.\n\nA: \nI was told by Apple Support to hold my computer's cloud drive on pause\nwhile I organize my files. They saw how I had many files on Desktop\nand Documents.\n\nIt's worth pointing out that iCloud Drive can be configured to automatically sync the contents of your Desktop and Documents folders to the cloud.\nWhen this feature is on, then files in these folders will contribute towards the total of your iCloud storage. If your storage goes over 5Gb, you have to pay Apple a subscription.\n\nAssuming that you have this feature turned on, I suspect that the Apple Support 'genius' was advising you to move files out of these folders in order to reduce the total amount of data in your iCloud storage.\nYou can see whether iCloud Drive is configured to sync your Desktop & Documents folders in System Preferences (now called Settings in Ventura), under your AppleID > iCloud Drive options.\n\nNote that if you turn this off, you don't necessarily keep all your existing files on your Mac's Desktop & Documents folders, because they're presumed to be \"in the cloud\", and you've stopped this Mac from syncing to it. That's another reason why you might want to move everything out, before you turn it off.\nI'd suggest it's only worthwhile syncing your entire Desktop & Documents folders if you need to share lots of your files with another Mac.\nAs said in the comments, any other folder inside your user account will be fine for file storage, e.g. /Users/lydiaeguchi/myFiles or anything you like.\nYou must keep a backup of your files on an external drive, either physically connected or on your local network. iCloud Drive is NOT a backup.\n", "Q: Does iOS app location tracking require permission? Some apps say they track location in “data linked to you” in their app privacy label.\nFor example, the game Roblox.\n\nBut, these apps (like Roblox) don’t always appear in the Settings -> Privacy & Security -> Location Services list of apps with permission to see the device location.\n\nDoes that mean the app can’t access the device location? (Then why is “location“ listed in the privacy label?)\nOr, does this mean the app has some other way of accessing device location that does not require user permission?\nIf you can cite an authoritative source (like the iOS SDK or other apple developer documentation) in your answer, I would appreciate it\n\nA: The app isn’t using iOS’s Location Tracking services though it can track you in different ways (none of which have anything to do with iOS or Apple)\n\nDoes that mean the app can’t access the device location? (Then why is “location“ listed in the privacy label?)\n\nIf you disable Location Services globally then run the App and it doesn’t prompt you to enable them, it’s not using Location Services on your device.\nThe label, as you described it, is nothing more than a disclosure by developer detailing what they could potentially track, not what they are actually doing. If they say they track something, but don’t, then no harm no foul.  If they don’t disclose something but actually engage in an activity, they can be sanctioned by Apple. Why the developer said they track you/your device but not actually track using Location Services is up to them.\n\nOr, does this mean the app has some other way of accessing device location that does not require user permission?\n\nYes, they can track you in other ways such as your public  IP address or SSID (iOS 13 and older).  Neither of these are part if Location Services - they will know your IP simply from the request from the App to the server; you can’t block that. In fact, it can be argued that it’s the developers right to know where the server requests are coming from.\nIf they know your SSID and BSSID (which they will if they access Networking) they can look up that value in a database to pin point your location. Granted, it won’t be precise, but generally within a few hundred meters.\nCross referencing the geo-IP with the geo-SSID and then linking it to your account, the developer can have a fairly good idea of where you are and track you with a fairly good degree of certainty.\nBelow is an SSID map for the Fort Lauderdale area as of this posting. Using the search tools on this website, anyone can determine a device’s relative location with a known SSID and BSSID.\n\nEven if they can’t get your SSID (iOS 14 and newer), the IP alone is more than enough to reasonably track your general location and associate it to an account.  Remember, large companies (malls, airports, hospitals, government entities, etc.) that offer free Wi-Fi access to the Internet often have their own public IP address that map right to their physical location - meaning it’s pretty accurate!\nNone of this requires your permission and it all happens on the server (back end) well outside of your device and iOS.\n", "Q: iOS encryption key derivation (from PIN code) iOS has recently requested me to confirm my PIN code which is used to encrypt my data.\nIf the PIN code is used to derivate the encryption key I find this weird since most PINs are a 4 or 6 digit number. Therefore that would make only 10^4 to 10^6 possible keys. I guess the PIN must be salted, yet if an attacker knows what is used to salt, it's still only 10^6 possibilities and therefore something very easy to bruteforce if a way is found to extract the encrypted data out of the device (or iCloud).\nCan someone explain how Apple derivates the key from the PIN while still being at the top of encryption \"Art\"?\nThank you.\n\nA: As provided by @Tetsujin the following link provides the answer: https://marcan.st/2016/03/untangling-ios-pin-code-security/\n\nare again encrypted using a key that is derived from the user’s PIN.\nThis means that you need to know the PIN to access the data. Deriving\nthe key also requires a secret key available inside the iPhone’s CPU.\n\n\nA: Even with the salt in the attackers' hands for example via reverse engineering, iOS has the Security Lockout feature which does not enable the user to try the PIN code more than a handful times.\nIf however the Security Lockout would be reverse engineered and disabled the encrypted data would be more easily bruteforced because like you said there would only be 106 amount of possible keys.\n", "Q: Where should I report a icloud.com bug?

When I run Disk Utility (on Monterey), I see listed among my disks:\n\nDisk Images\niOS 16.0 Simulator\n\nWhy? What is a simulator disk image and why is it \"open\"?\n\nA: Apparently, this has something to do with how Xcode makes older simulator SDKs available. The current SDK is iOS 16.2, but I also had downloaded iOS 16.0 (because 16.2 has introduced some bugs that I wanted to confirm by comparison with 16.0).

Apparently since macOS Catalina 10.15 Mac disabled support for 32-bit apps?\nHow can Steam games like Portal 2 be played on MacBooks that have been keeping up with macOS updates?\nIn my case I'd like to do this on Intel MacBooks from 2015.\n\nA: I rolled my 2018 Mac Mini back to Mojave.\nIn hindsight, I wouldn't have done that (I lost a few factory-loaded apps).  I would have gotten a very fast USB thumb drive and put a Mojave OS (and the games) on that.  That particular drive is what I used for my gaming until I got a slightly faster USB-C drive.  Apple explains how to get previous versions of macOS, here.\nMacWorld has a procedure on that.

Is there a way to open a specific app in dark mode while the rest of the system is set to light mode?\nI know the reverse can be done by setting NSRequiresAquaSystemAppearance=true for the app in question, but that just forces it to always use light mode regardless of the system setting, and setting it to false means the app will follow the system theme.\nI'm mainly looking for an answer that works back in macOS 10.14 but tricks for later systems would be great too.\n\nA: \nIs there a way to open a specific app in dark mode while the rest of the system is set to light mode?\n\nOnly if the app supports it.\nDark mode is a systemwide setting, but an app is not required to support it.  Per Apple Support:\n\nDark Mode uses a dark color scheme that works system wide, including with the apps that come with your Mac. Apps from other developers can adopt it, too. If an app doesn't use a dark color scheme when Dark Mode is turned on, it doesn't support Dark Mode, or it has its own settings for working with Dark Mode or controlling its color scheme.\n\nEmphasis Mine\nIf Dark mode is supported by the app and to do what you want, the app would need to support overriding the systemwide dark mode setting and save your choice as a persistent setting in its preferences.\n", "Q: Routing traffic on two NICs I have a Mac with two NICs.\n\n*\n\n*Interface #1 is on VLAN blue, with IP 10.41.0.18\n\n*Interface #2 is on VLAN red, with IP 192.168.38.16\n\nBoth VLANs are separated, interface #1 is the main one.\nOn the Mac, I have an application that must be able to communicate with a bunch of specific IPs on both VLAN blue and red.\nIs there a way I can route traffic on interface 1 or 2, depending on the IP called by the application?\n\nA: Yes, what you want is simply the default behavior on macOS (and other major operating systems).\nYou will have two network interfaces in macOS - one with the 10.41.0.18 IP address and one with the 192.168.38.16 address. The principle is the same no matter if you just connect each network to a separate network port on the Mac Pro, or you have a single network cable connected with multiple VLANs on.\nWhen an application running on the Mac wants to communicate with an IP address on either network, the data will be routed according to your routing table.\nI don't know your specific network, but from your IP addresses, you'll probably have something like:\n  network 1: 10.41.0.0/8 (255.0.0.0)\n  network 2: 192.168.38.0/24 (255.255.255.0)\n\nThis means that packets destined for an IP address of the form 10.41.xxx.xx will go out the network 1 interface, and packets destined for an IP address on the form 192.168.38.xxx will go out the network 2 interface.\nYour subnet masks might vary slightly, but this is the general idea.\nUsually you'll also have a default gateway defined on one network interfaces. IP addresses that do not fall in those two sub-networks above will be routed to the default gateway instead over that particular network interface.\n", "Q: Files don’t open in first attempt I moved folders on Desktop to consolidate files.

The process for doing this depends on whether your Mac has an Intel processor or an Apple chip.\nIf you're not sure how to boot into Safe Mode, refer to Start up your Mac in safe mode. Once you've booted into Safe Mode, test the same things.\nWhen you've finished testing, just restart your Mac to boot up again normally.\nIf your Mac works normally while in Safe Mode, this means we have narrowed down the problem to software that's loading when your Mac boots up. If so, it's time to investigate login items, fonts, and kernel extensions. See below.\nIf your Mac still displays this behaviour during Safe Mode, let me know so we can investigate further.\n\nInvestigating login items, fonts, and kernel extensions\nLet's start with Login Items:\n\n*\n\n*Startup normally\n\n*Go to System Settings > Users & Groups\n\n*Select the General icon\n\n*Click on Login Items\n\n*Now remove all of \"Open at Login\" items by highlighting them and clicking on the - button below\n\n*Restart your computer\n\nNow your Mac will boot up without those login items loading.

A little more info below:\n\nFonts:- You can remove any of the fonts you've installed yourself to see if this makes a difference.\nKernel Extensions:- You can open Terminal (found within your Utilites folder) and enter the following command:\nkextstat | grep -v com.apple\nThe above command will list 3rd party kernel extensions (you may need to stretch the Terminal window so it's easier to read). Look for anything you don't remember installing, or something that belongs to software you've removed, or just anything that looks out of place. Remember though, this is a list of 3rd party kernel extensions and therefore any of them could be causing the problem.\n\nA: Went to the Apple store and the assistant was able to reproduce the bug, in the machines they have.

I would like to set up my MacBook as a VPN Travel router with 2 devices connected to it via Ethernet. I have 2 adapters that I can connect to my MacBook Pro but I'm not sure if it will work? Essentially, I wanted to set up my Mac as Wiregaurd Client. I want to attach 2 ethernet adapters to the Mac and connect to\nmy VPN server though the MacBook. I understand hotspot does not work without my Mac connecting directly to a router but this is not an issue for me.\n\nA: This is not meant to be a HOWTO for your particular application (it would be much too long for thus site) but an overview of what needs to be done to accomplish your goal.\nmacOS can function as a router.  You will need:\n\n*\n\n*2 network interfaces:  one connecting to the Internet, the other for your LAN\n\n*The WireGurad macOS client configured and working.\n\n*DHCP, DNS, and routing services configured and running\n\n*pf firewall configured to block all incoming Internet traffic by default, creating routes to forward traffic from the LAN to Internet or VPN as desired, and opening ports to allow VPN traffic to/from LAN.\n\n*Your default route must must be bound to the VPN tunnel (created by the WG client) if you want all traffic going through the VPN.  If you want only specific traffic to go through the VPN (i.e. browsing through local Internet and email through VPN), you’ll need to configure this in your routing table and pf firewall\n\nWhile it’s technically a simple and straightforward setup, it’s not an easy one.  There have been many existing questions/answers posted to this site on how to configure each of the elements described above.  Here is a sampling:\n\n*\n\n*Mac DHCP Server\n\n*How to use mac as a full router with DHCP, DNS, Port Fowarding etc.?\n\n*How to configure MacOS firewall to block outgoing IP ranges?\n\n*How to open a port in macOS Sierra 10.12.4\n\n*Passing L2TP over IPSec VPN through a `pf` Firewall\nThis is by no means a comprehensive list, but it should give you some points of reference for each of the components you’ll have to configure to make this work\n", "Q: What is the silver checkered circle on the iPhone 14 camera panel?

So I know I can actually run .dmg files. I just can't double click them in Safari or install stuff from brew.\nSo clearly there is some very particular reason for all this and I would appreciate if anyone could fill me in on what is going on and what I can investigate. Thanks.\n\nA: \nI just can't double click them [DMG files] in Safari or install stuff from brew.\n\nNo, you can't \"double-click\" DMG files to run from Safari.  It's not a filetype Safari knows how to handle.  As for installing applications, the typical type of DMG is read-only so you wouldn't be able to write anything to it.\nJust double click the DMG in Finder and it should automatically mount the volume and open a Finder window showing the file to be copied or installer to be run.\nA DMG file is an Apple Disk Image and is a completely separate entity from your APFS container.  To install software, you shouldn't be mounting/dismounting your APFS volumes; it's unclear why you're doing so.\n\nI am pretty sure I was learning how to partition my disk to install Linux and I may have done something with diskutil like unmounting my primary disk.\n\nIf you're booted into macOS, you simply cannot unmount your primary drive.  You'd need to boot into Recovery to make those changes.\nDual booting an OS has been asked/answered many times and there are excellent guides on how to do this.  However, this is unrelated to installing software via Homebrew.  As you're new to all of this, I don't advise you go down the dual/multi-boot path just yet.  Instead, try things out in a virtual environment (VirtualBox is free).  You can run things in \"seamless mode\" meaning that it appears as if it's running natively rather than in a window.\nYou'll gain valuable experience running things before you take on the challenge of modifying APFS containers and drive partitions.\nThat said, if you do plan on persuing a dual/multi-boot system, be sure to back everything up before you proceed!\nAs for installing your Homebrew Apps, it's best to peruse the documentation to gain a familiarity with how things work.  However, to summarize, you'd install a package with the command brew install <formulae>.  We even have questions/answers on how to install formulae from local files which is what you'd do if you had a DMG with brew formulae/packages contained within it.\n", "Q: How to have Numbers automatically sort descending?

However, you can avoid choosing your preferred order every time by creating a sorting rule and then using the Sort Now menu option in iPadOS Numbers as follows:\nTo create a sorting rule:\n\n*\n\n*Select a table to sort, or select just specific rows in a column to sort.\n\n*Tap the Organize  button, tap the Sort tab, then tap Entire Table or Selected Rows.\n\n*Tap Add a Column, then tap a column to sort by.\n\n*By default, the column sorts in ascending order. To change this, tap the rule in green below the column name.\n\n*Tap Done.\n\nTo apply a sorting rule:\n\n*\n\n*Activate the table to be sorted by tapping anywhere on that table.\n\n*Tap the Organize  button, tap the Sort tab, and then tap Sort Now.\n\n*Tap Done to go back to the table which should have been been sorted now as specified in the rule.\n\nFor more, see the \"Sort table data in Numbers on iPad\" Apple support webpage.\n", "Q: Adding an ISO image to an APFS volume and booting it I know there is tons of information on this and similar questions on this site, but I have been at this for a couple hours and could use some confirmation of a few specific details.\nI just want to write a CentOS Minimal ISO image for ARM64 I downloaded, to my M1 MacBook Air, 2021.\nMy current understanding is that you should not partition the actual disk for a Mac disk, but rather create a new APFS volume in the main APFS container:\n/dev/disk0 (internal):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                         251.0 GB   disk0\n   1:             Apple_APFS_ISC ⁨⁩                        524.3 MB   disk0s1\n   2:                 Apple_APFS ⁨Container disk3⁩         245.1 GB   disk0s2\n   3:        Apple_APFS_Recovery ⁨⁩                        5.4 GB     disk0s3\n\n/dev/disk3 (synthesized):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      APFS Container Scheme -                      +245.1 GB   disk3\n                                 Physical Store disk0s2\n   1:                APFS Volume ⁨Macintosh HD⁩            23.4 GB    disk3s1\n   2:              APFS Snapshot ⁨com.apple.os.update-...⁩ 23.4 GB    disk3s1s1\n   3:                APFS Volume ⁨Preboot⁩                 847.5 MB   disk3s2\n   4:                APFS Volume ⁨Recovery⁩                1.7 GB     disk3s3\n   5:                APFS Volume ⁨Data⁩                    136.6 GB   disk3s5\n   6:                APFS Volume ⁨VM⁩                      20.5 KB    disk3s6\n   7:                APFS Volume ⁨Nix Store⁩               2.7 GB     disk3s7\n   8:                APFS Volume ⁨centos⁩                  20.0 GB    disk3s9\n\nSo disk3 is sort of a \"virtual\" or \"synthetic\" partition or disk, it is not actually a partition but it basically acts like one within the context of APFS.\nI was operating on the assumption that I just needed to make a new volume and write to it using dd:\naddVolume seems to work (now I have centOS twice obviously, this is just to test this command):\n~ % diskutil apfs addVolume disk3 APFS centos\nWill export new APFS Volume \"centos\" from APFS Container Reference disk3\nStarted APFS operation on disk3\nPreparing to add APFS Volume to APFS Container disk3\nCreating APFS Volume\nCreated new APFS Volume disk3s8\nMounting APFS Volume\nSetting volume permissions\nDisk from APFS operation: disk3s8\nFinished APFS operation on disk3\n~ % diskutil list\n/dev/disk0 (internal):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                         251.0 GB   disk0\n   1:             Apple_APFS_ISC ⁨⁩                        524.3 MB   disk0s1\n   2:                 Apple_APFS ⁨Container disk3⁩         245.1 GB   disk0s2\n   3:        Apple_APFS_Recovery ⁨⁩                        5.4 GB     disk0s3\n\n/dev/disk3 (synthesized):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      APFS Container Scheme -                      +245.1 GB   disk3\n                                 Physical Store disk0s2\n   1:                APFS Volume ⁨Macintosh HD⁩            23.4 GB    disk3s1\n   2:              APFS Snapshot ⁨com.apple.os.update-...⁩ 23.4 GB    disk3s1s1\n   3:                APFS Volume ⁨Preboot⁩                 847.5 MB   disk3s2\n   4:                APFS Volume ⁨Recovery⁩                1.7 GB     disk3s3\n   5:                APFS Volume ⁨Data⁩                    138.5 GB   disk3s5\n   6:                APFS Volume ⁨VM⁩                      20.5 KB    disk3s6\n   7:                APFS Volume ⁨Nix Store⁩               2.7 GB     disk3s7\n   8:                APFS Volume ⁨centos⁩                  20.0 GB    disk3s9\n   9:                APFS Volume ⁨centos⁩                  766.0 KB   disk3s8\n\nI unmounted it to be able to write to it:\n~ % diskutil unmount disk3s9\nVolume centos on disk3s9 unmounted\n\nThis is the path to the ISO image:\n~ % fp=/Users/____.O.____/Downloads/CentOS-7-aarch64-Minimal-2009.iso\n\nThis is where I've gotten stuck:\n~ % sudo dd if=$fp of=/dev/disk3s9 \nPassword:\ndd: /dev/disk3s9: Permission denied\n1+0 records in\n0+0 records out\n0 bytes transferred in 0.000498 secs (0 bytes/sec)\n\nI have tried it with different bs values too but it doesn't affect it.\nOne slight difficulty is that a lot of information is about writing from or booting from a USB drive but I don't want to.

Could anyone explain to me the precise details of what must be done here and what would be nice is to confirm as much as possible that it's working before I actually reboot to really see.\nThanks.\n\nA: Your various attempts at creating the right kind of \"storage\" for CentOS are unfortunately in vain. The basic premise of your endeavour is unfortunately incorrect: CentOS does not run natively on the M1 Mac. You simply cannot install it that way.\nIn general, you cannot just write an ISO image to the disk and expect it to boot. That goes for the M1/M2 Macs - as well as other, Intel-based computers.\nIf you want to run CentOS on your M1 Mac, you'll want to install it in virtualized environment - using for example the Parallels Desktop or VMware Fusion software (commercial softwares) or for example VirtualBox.\n", "Q: Error: joplin: It seems the App source '/Applications/Joplin.app' is not there When I want to use brew to upgrade the system:\n$ brew upgrade                                                                                                     ‹ruby-2.7.2›\n==> Upgrading 1 outdated package:\nsshfs 2.10_2 -> 3.7.3\nError: sshfs has been disabled because it requires closed-source macFUSE!\n==> Casks with 'auto_updates true' or 'version :latest' will not be upgraded; pass `--greedy` to upgrade them.\n==> Upgrading 1 outdated package:\njoplin 2.1.8 -> 2.8.8\n==> Upgrading joplin\n==> Downloading https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/releases/download/v2.8.8/Joplin-2.8.8.dmg\nAlready downloaded: /Users/dolphin/Library/Caches/Homebrew/downloads/b97405d6b948853d8d267346608a466e548c03db66761a82d528dbad1c9afd8f--Joplin-2.8.8.dmg\n==> Purging files for version 2.8.8 of Cask joplin\nError: joplin: It seems the App source '/Applications/Joplin.app' is not there.\n(base)\n\nwhy did this happen? what should I do to fixed this problem?\n\nA: You installed an application \"Joplin\" previously using Brew.

On the first, all runs smoothly.

As I mentioned, my first keyboard is working fine and I do not want to break its functionalities.\nHow can I fix?\n\nA: Most Windows keyboards don't have a 'right Option' Key.

I tried bash as well but the answer stays the same.\nAny idea?\n\nA: In the error message you included in your question, there seem to be two spaces between : and grep.

I have deleted a folder on my iPhone and removed the containing apps from homescreen. Now they are only in the App Library after the last homescreen.\nI don’t know exactly what apps where in this folder.\nHow can I check which apps are only in the App Library and not on the homescreen?\nIs there a Shortcuts that can create a list?\n\nA: There's no way to script this in Shortcuts or find it in settings as a list with iOS 16.2\nThe best you can do is long press and hold on an app in the App Library and add it to the Home Screen.\n\n", "Q: iOS - Limit apps with push notifications priviledges to only be able to push essential notifications Ive got push notifications enabled for certain apps on my iPhone running iOS16.\nFor some apps like Uber and Uber Eats you really need the push notifications to use the service, eg to know when your taxi / food has arrived.\nThe problem is some apps seem to take advantage of this and basically spam you with offers, updates and promotions, as notifications to your home screen which is really irritating. The Uber and Uber Eats apps seem really bad at this.\nIs there any way I can limit these apps to only give me essential notifactions ?\n\nA: No, you cannot selectively disable notifications because iOS does not have information about what the notifications contain.\nApps can mark notifications Time Sensitive, and you can allow these to break through Do Not Disturb, but this doesn't really address your issue.\nThis means the issue is between you and Uber (for example). I believe that Uber does have a setting for promotional messages, if you can find it... Otherwise, you'll have to reach out to their customer support or find another app that respects your time.\n", "Q: Why does my internet not work when on cellular data with a VPN enabled I am using 16.1.2 on Iphone SE 2.\nI am using NordVPN on the device that was automatically configured by the app.\nWhen I am on WIFI, the internet and VPN all function as expected. When I am on cellular, there is no internet connection. If I then disable the VPN using the NordVPN app, internet is restored.\nIf I use the NordVPN app to connect to a VPN, it always fails when on mobile.\nIf I navigate to the device setting VPN page...it continually shows the status \"Connecting...\".\nHow can I use NordVPN on my iOS device while on Cellular?\n\nA: Your carrier is blocking VPN traffic\n\nIf I navigate to the device setting VPN page...it continually shows the status \"Connecting...\".\n\nThis means your VPN hasn’t connected and the Internet traffic that is supposed to go through the VPN tunnel simply cannot because the tunnel hasn’t actually been established.\nA VPN is a bandwidth intensive protocol.  Even if you are doing nothing, it keeps sending  packets to keep your tunnel active. When not using a VPN, your device and the server/firewall will remember the state of the connection even though there’s no traffic due to no activity. So, a VPN connection can be “costly” for the carrier.\nCarriers typically don’t explicitly say “we block VPNs” however, in their contracts there is usually verbiage saying they have the right to block/manage traffic on their networks.\nBesides, most large carriers have “business grade” VPN plans/services.  They want you to use their product, not a competitor’s\n", "Q: Strange \"command not found\" and \"No such file or directory\" errors Very strange errors of multiple forms:\n\n*\n\n*Running brew install c-ares fails with command not found, seemingly not even executing brew:\n$ brew install c-ares\n-bash: brew install c-ares: command not found\n\nYet brew install cmake executes brew as expected:\n$ brew install cmake\nWarning: Treating cmake as a formula.

However, the built-in mic makes the audio quality fairly bad, so I am trying to use a headset connected by Bluetooth.  When I record, the audio quality isn't improved at all and I suspect that it's because the recording is still using the built-in mic rather than the connected Bluetooth input.

Unfortunately I can't do this work on my Windows computer because that doesn't have good enough screen-writing abilities.\nDoes anyone know how to make screen recording on iPad which uses a Bluetooth input?\n\nA: I figured this out -- it turns out that my headset is a Logitech device, and I hadn't updated my iPad's Logi Tune app in a long time.

I've seen some people mention using iCloud+'s aliasing feature to achieve a similar result, but I have too many tags to map them all in this way. I also have a catch-all feature set up, but this would not work for me because I have multiple users on the domain using the +tag syntax and I don't want emails for janedoe+tag@mydomain.com to go to joebloe@mydomain.com - they should go to janedoe@mydomain.com instead.\n\nA: A simple test from my iCloud email account to myself with a tag (\"myaccountname+atag@icloud.com\") worked as expected - i.e. the test email was received AOK at \"myaccountname@icloud.com\"\nSo iCloud email handling does conform to RFC2822 (§3.2.4) as one would hope.\n", "Q: How to close all windows in one swoop?

There’s also no versioning of these settings.\n\nFor the record, things that I want to know the defaults\nincludes\n\n*\n\n*mouse speed, keyboard repeat speed\n\n*shortcuts, especially Accessibility shortcuts\n\n*anything related to muscle memory (don't want to muscle-memorize the wrong shortcut)\n\n\nThere is no “default mouse speed.”  Each mouse is different, especially the sensitivity of the mouse hardware and its calibration from the factory. This setting allows you to tweak the speed to accommodate your preference.  Change the mouse (especially manufacturer) and that previous setting may no longer apply.\nThere are system wide shortcuts including Accessibility shortcuts that you could consider “defaults.” You can change them of course and they will be listed in the custom shortcuts list that you create.   There’s no need to remember these as anything you modify will revert back once you delete the custom shortcut.\n", "Q: Constant beeping and erasing words, not typing after hours of use (MacBook Pro 13-inch, 2017, four thunderbolt 3 ports) I have a five-year old 2017 MacBook Pro with 8 GB of RAM. After hours of use, and never on startup, my MBP continuously beeps, and it does not stop for several minutes.\nWhile it is beeping, I can't use my keyboard (I have an external mechanical keyboard, a Keychron K4, in case it is the keyboard malfunctioning - some of the keys are giving in, I think it's the switches). Worse yet, it starts erasing words and lines and paragraphs very rapidly in important Word documents I am working on!!\nI have to save immediately, close, and then restart otherwise it will delete the entire document.\nWhen I restart, I have to fix what I lost.\nWhat could be causing this malfunction and how do I fix it?\n\nA: \nit starts erasing words and lines and paragraphs very rapidly in important Word documents I am working on.\n\nThis is symptomatic of a failing keyboard.  It is likely the keys are becoming stuck and filling up the buffer to the point it’s full; this explains the beeping.  The erasing of words and lines could be the Backspace or Delete key being held.\nRemove your external keyboard. If the problem no longer persists, the keyboard is at fault. If not, you likely have an issue with the built in keyboard.\nAs a Keychron user myself, the switches are replaceable. If you narrow it down to this keyboard, the good news is you can fix it easily and inexpensively\n", "Q: Is it possible to hide my Mac(s) from network-connected other Mac(s)? I always connect my MacBook Pro to my network, and also some of other Macs. Recently, our boss hired a new guy, that currently has no privileges to see other Mac's data and such. I thought I could hide them like Windows can (by setting network privacy to public or something), and it seems to be possible.\nHowever, that question's answer says that,\n\nIn terms of the Finder, make sure File Sharing, Remote Management and Screen Sharing are all unchecked and your computer won't appear in another user's sidebar.\n\nSo it seems that I have to turn off the File Sharing. Problem is that we need to have that. While the new guy doesn't have privileges to see data, some of the files are crucial to our job, and these are not restricted to him (and they're placed in separated folder). While we could give that to him via USB memory or something, we'd like it to be stay updated, since that file is our customer's information and something like that.\nWindows is very good at handling the situation like this. Even if they're hidden from explorer's side bar, user can still connect to them by using the IP address. It seems to be Mac isn't able to do so.\nIs there any way to hide Mac while having file sharing enabled? If not, what could be alternative method?\n\nA: \nWindows is very good at handling the situation like this. Even if they're hidden from explorer's side bar, user can still connect to them by using the IP address. It seems to be Mac isn't able to do so.\n\nWindows does this through Firewall rules - it blocks protocols like WINS, NetBIOS, Discovery, etc. macOS can do this as well with the pf firewall.\nHowever, (IMO) this is pointless. To hide your computer only to deliberately hand out the IP is like paying the phone company for a number that shows up as “blocked” to be hidden only to post your number on a billboard; it’s counterintuitive.  If you’re on a public Wi-Fi, then this (turning off network discovery) is very much desirable.\nInstead, you should be focusing on sharing permissions and access control lists. Personally, I would get a NAS (start small) that has these functions built in and easy to implement. This way the availability of your Mac is not necessary for the “new guy” to do his work.\n", "Q: Problems installing mountain lion I have been fighting to downgrade my MacBook Pro 2012 to mountain lion. I accidentally let it update to catilina. I struggled to create the bootable usb according to all the videos online (ended up using super duper to create one) now when i boot with option I get into the mountain lion installer I can’t see my hard drive I only have the option to install to the the usb which won’t work either\n\nA: A quick check at everymac.com shows the earliest OS X that can be installed on a 2012 MacBook Pro model is between OS X 10.7 3 and OS X 10.8.2 inclusively. Therefore, you should be able to install Mountain Lion on your Mac. However, everymac.com shows the earliest OS X that can installed on my iMac (21.5-inch, Late 2013) is\nOS X 10.8.4 and I can not boot from any OS X 10.8.5 installer created using instructions given in this answer. My 2011 iMac will boot without any issues.\nCatalina uses APFS which will not be recognized by Mountain Lion. After booting from the Mountain Lion installer, you will need to open the Disk Utility and erase the entire internal drive. You should choose \"Mac OS Extended (Journaled)\" as the format. Use \"GUID Partition Map\" as the scheme.\nSince you have stated you have correctly created the USB Mountain Lion installer, I will not post how to do so. However, if you are still unable to install, perhaps you should include in your question the steps you used to create the installer.\n\nUpdate 1: Test Install of Mountain Lion\nI did download the InstallMacOSX.dmg file for OS X 10.8.5 (Mountain Lion) from How to download macOS on a iMac (21.5-inch, Late 2013) with macOS 10.15.7 (Catalina) installed. I was able to create a Mountain Lion bootable installer from this downloaded file. I did not need to use any third party tools (such as SuperDuper) to create the installer. I used the bootable installer to install Mount Lion in a VMware Fusion Player (Version 12.1.0) virtual machine. After installing, I was able to download and install all available updates except for an update to iTunes 12.14.3. I was able to download this update on the host and transfer the update to the virtual machine where installation was successful.\n\nUpdate 2: How to Get the InstallESD.dmg File from Apple\nThis was tested using macOS Catalina (10.15.7).\n\n*\n\n*From How to download macOS, download the InstallMacOSX.dmg file for OS X 10.8.5 (Mountain Lion) to your ~/Downloads folder.\n\n\n*Enter the command below to open InstallMacOSX.dmg. This will mount the readonly Mac OS Extended (HFS+) volume on /Volumes/Install Mac OS X.\nhdiutil attach ~/Downloads/InstallMacOSX.dmg \n\n\n\n*Enter the command below to extract folders and files from InstallMacOSX.dmg to the ~/Downloads/pkg folder. Here, I assume the ~/Downloads/pkg folder does not already exist.\npkgutil --expand /Volumes/Install\\ Mac\\ OS\\ X/InstallMacOSX.pkg ~/Downloads/pkg\n\n\n\n*Enter the command below to eject /Volumes/Install Mac OS X.\n diskutil eject /Volumes/Install\\ Mac\\ OS\\ X/\n\n\n\n*Use the command below to move the InstallESD.dmg file to the ~/Downloads folder.\nmv ~/Downloads/pkg/InstallMacOSX.pkg/InstallESD.dmg ~/Downloads/\n\n\n\n*Use the Finder application to move the ~/Downloads/pkg folder to the Trash.\n\n\n*(Optional). To save space, you can move the downloaded file ~/Downloads/InstallMacOSX.dmg to the Trash, then empty the Trash.\nI should point out that the InstallMacOSX.dmg file can be used to create an Install OS X Mountain Lion application. This application also contains an InstallESD.dmg file in the Contents/SharedSupport folder. While these two InstallESD.dmg files are different sizes, the contents are identical.\n\nUpdate 3: Creating a APM USB Flash Drive Installer\nI was unable to use the Disk Utility included with Catalina to create a bootable USB flash drive installer. So I used the following steps to transfer an exact image from the InstallESD.dmg file to the flash drive.\n\n*\n\n*Insert a 8 GB or larger USB flash drive.\n\n\n*Enter the command below to open InstallESD.dmg file. This will mount the readonly Mac OS Extended (HFS+) volume on /Volumes/Mac OS X Install ESD.\nhdiutil attach ~/Downloads/InstallESD.dmg\n\n\n\n*Enter the command below to determined the identifiers for the external, physical USB flash drive and the disk image. In my case, the flash drive has been assigned disk5 and the disk image has been assigned disk6. If your assignments are different, then make the appropriate substitutions in the following steps.\ndiskutil list\n\n\n\n*Unmount all volumes on both the flash drive and disk image by entering the commands given below.\ndiskutil unmountdisk disk5\ndiskutil unmountdisk disk6\n\n\n\n*Enter the command below to transfer a exact copy of the disk image to the flash drive.\n\nNote: The transfer occurs faster when the identifiers are proceeded by the letter r.\n\nsudo dd if=/dev/rdisk6 of=/dev/rdisk5 bs=1m\n\n\n\n*Enter the command below to eject the mounted disk image.\ndiskutil eject disk6\n\nNote: The flash drive is using the Apple Partition Map (APM).\nUpdate 4: Converting from APM to GPT\nIf your Mac can not boot from a flash drive using the Apple Partition Map (APM), then use the following steps to covert to a GUID Partition Table (GPT).\n\n*\n\n*Enter the command below to get the beginning partition offset in sectors (512-Byte-Device-Blocks) of the volume labeled Mac OS X Install ESD on the USB flash drive installer. Also, get the disk (partition) size in sectors (512-Byte-Units). If your identifier for the USB flash drive installer differs from disk5, then make the appropriate substitution.\ndiskutil info disk5s2 | grep -e Offset -e Size\n\n   Partition Offset:          32768 Bytes (64 512-Byte-Device-Blocks)\n   Disk Size:                 4.9 GB (4856860672 Bytes) (exactly 9486056 512-Byte-Units)\n   Device Block Size:         512 Bytes\n   Allocation Block Size:     4096 Bytes\n\n \n\nNote: You can get the same values by using the sudo pdisk -l /dev/disk5 command. However, you will need to multiply the base and length values by 4 to convert to the Partition Offset and Disk Size 512 byte sector values shown above.\n\n\n\n*Enter the commands below to create the GUID Partition Table (GPT). Use the offset and size values determined in the previous step. If your values are different for the identifier, offset and/or size, then make the appropriate substitutions. The gpt destroy command may generate an error message which can be ignored.\n\nNote: The offset follows the -b option and the size follows the -s option.\n\ndiskutil unmountdisk disk5\nsudo gpt destroy disk5\ndiskutil unmountdisk disk5\nsudo gpt create disk5\nsudo gpt add -i 1 -b 64 -s 9486056 -t hfs disk5 \n\nThe rest of the steps are optional.\n\n\n*Turn on journalling.\ndiskutil enableJournal disk5s1\n\n\n\n*Add free space to the volume.\ndiskutil resizevolume disk5s1 R\n\n\n\n*Rename the volume.\ndiskutil renamevolume disk5s1 \"Install Mountain Lion\"\n\n\n\n*Add an icon which appears in the Mac Startup Manager on some Macs.\ncp /Volumes/Install\\ Mountain\\ Lion/Install\\ OS\\ X\\ Mountain\\ Lion.app/Contents/Resources/InstallAssistant.icns /Volumes/Install\\ Mountain\\ Lion/.VolumeIcon.icns\n\n\n\n*Change the label.

Previously when I played football I used the 'outdoor run' workout. But the last few times I have played football I have used the 'football' workout.\nThe outdoor run workout burned 4.6 kcal per minute in December, but so far football has burned 8.4 kcal per minute. So football is burning double the number of kcal compared to a run, which does not seem right.\nWhy is there such a big difference?\n\nA: Apple Watch workouts fall into two categories:\n\n*\n\n*Some workouts, like \"Outdoor Run\" are optimized to the specific workout. This means they understand what your whole body is doing and are tuned to use just your wrist movement/heart rate to understand the intensity of the workout.\n\n*Other workouts, like \"Other\" are not tailored to any specific workout. This includes some labeled workouts, which work like \"Other\" but label the workout appropriately. Football falls into this category, it's using the \"Other\" algorithm under the hood.\n\nYou can read more about this from this support article - the ones that do not have their own section in this article fall into \"Other\": https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207934\n\nWhen you use Other, or any workout type available in the Add Workout section, you earn the credit equivalent of a brisk walk when these sensor readings are unavailable.\n\nThis means that your results can be inflated if the watch is having trouble understanding what you're doing, as it defaults to \"brisk walk\" in those scenarios.\n", "Q: How could I make iPhone 7 run iOS 16 in order to connect with an Apple Watch with watchOS 9? I would do anything if I could make my iPhone 7 (now on iOS 15.7) run iOS 16  in order to connect with an Apple Watch with watchOS 9. Would jailbreaking be a solution?\n\nA: You cannot run iOS 16 on iPhone 7\nYou cannot connect a Watch running watchOS 9 to an iPhone running iOS 15.\nWatches sold with watchOS 9 shipping indicate this in their system requirements, with the following text appearing directly above \"Add to Bag\":\n\nApple Watch requires an iPhone 8 or later with iOS 16 or later.\n\nApple Support will uninstall beta versions of watchOS, but they will always install the latest compatible release version. They will not revert to a previous version.

Both tied to the same Apple ID and password.\nI am wearing an Apple Watch 6.\nWhen I switch between the accounts I always have to use TouchID or password.\nAny way to make it switch without requiring TouchID or password, just by wearing the watch?\n\nA: Apple Watch and macOS allow you to unlock your Mac. When trying to switch accounts, your Mac is already unlocked. So, no, I don't think Apple Watch will help you switch accounts.\n", "Q: Glass sound missing in Apple Mail on macOS Monterey I'm using Apple Mail 16.0 (3696.120.41.1.1) on macOS Monterey 12.6.2 (21G320).\nI remember there used to be a sound called “Glass” or similar. I was using this for incoming e-mails some months/years ago.\nYou can hear that sound here.\nUnfortunately, I cannot find that sound in the list of sounds in Mail preferences any more:\n\nIs there a way to use this sound for incoming e-mails?\n\nA: Copy /System/Library/Sounds/Glass.aiff from an older system (before Big Sur) and place it into...\n~/Library/Sounds/\n\nSince the new glass sound still exists, but has been renamed to \"Crystal\" in System Preferences, or System Settings, renaming it to something else (e.g. in my case Glass-orig) might be advised.\nIt should then appear in Mail as an option to select as \"new messages sound\".\nThe above should also answer your second question as to why Apple removed it: they did not really remove it, but modernised it with the new \"Glass.aiff\" sound (as it's called in Finder), which displays as Crystal in the System Preferences.\n\nA: The old solution, copying Glass.aiff from /System/Library/Sounds off a Mac running macOS Monterey or earlier, does not work anymore.\nYou may wish to file feedback about this regression; Apple has (unfortunately) been making many recent decisions changing macOS to only have the same options as iOS.  (Since iOS can't have custom sounds in the stock Mail client without jailbreaking, now the Mac can't either.)\n", "Q: Troubleshooting international SIM connection issues on iPhone I have an iPhone SE 2 with a German O2 SIM card with an unlimited data plan and that is supposed to be able to use other networks when traveling in the EU. The last time I was in Sweden it often worked well and then there were totally unpredictable periods where it went down for a bit, anywhere from a few hours to days, then came back. During that time the phone might appear to be connected, showing full bars and LTE, but webpages never load. It looks like the phone thinks it’s connected but when it makes a request it never gets a response, not even an error one.\nI have checked stuff like mobile data being on, data roaming, if my cell phone bills are paid, and also talking to some cell phone network representatives. I would like to know how I can investigate the connection under the hood with commands to know where in the system the issue really is.\nCan I plug my iPhone into my Mac and somehow run command line commands to test the cell network in different ways, checking for confirmation that it is connected to the network, and trying to see specifically that a request went out and there is no response? Then I could know that it might be the Swedish networks that aren’t serving the number at that moment for some reason. Or, that it’s something else.\n\nA: No, you cannot plugin your iPhone into your Mac in order to run command line commands to test the cell network in different ways.\nIn the scenario you describe, the cell network provider did not or could fulfil your data requests. There could be many different reasons for that - most of them not detectable by your phone.\nIn case it happens again, just roam onto a different provider's network - or move to a location with better cell coverage.\n", "Q: Popup not going away after setting a new account I have set up my child's account on my MacBook but the following pop-up isn't going away. I gave my(admin) password and tried with a standard(logged-in account) password but the pop-up won't go away. why? It is very annoying]1\n\nA: This is likely due to corruption of the Keychain cache.\nThe first thing I would try is the following:\n\n*\n\n*Launch Terminal (If you're not familiar with Terminal, go to Finder, click on the Go menu and select the Utilities option. Then double-click on Terminal from the Finder window that appears.)\n\n\n*After Terminal opens, enter the following command (or copy and paste it):\ncd ~/Library/Keychains\n\n\n*Press return\n\n\n*Enter ls and press return again\n\n\n*The amount of data appearing on your screen will depend on how much is in your keychain\n\n\n*Take a note of the string that appeared immediately after you entered the ls command\n\n\n*It will look something like this:\n070CB08F-385G-519B-8FB2-FC21F5CFD4FD\n(Note: If you have a lot of data you may need to scroll up to see the string.)\n\n\n*Now type the following command in Terminal: rm -rf followed by the first three characters of the string that appeared for you. Using my example above, this means you'd enter rm -rf 070\n\n\n*Press tab to autopopulate the full string and then press enter\n\n\n*IMPORTANT: If at Step 6 you noticed there was more than one string appearing after the ls command, then you need to repeat Steps 8 - 9 for each string. So, if you had three sets of strings listed then you'd run the rm -rf command three times, one for each string.\n\n\n*Once complete, do a full reboot of your MacBook\nOnce rebooted, test to see if the issue is gone and let me know if not.\n", "Q: Create Thumbnail of 1st Page of a PDF I use an Automator application to move pdf files to a directory, then copy them to another directory, then convert the copy into a thumbnail using only the 1st page, with the file name remaining exactly the same as the original except with a .png extension instead of .pdf\nI had this working under Mavericks, but it stopped working when I upgraded to Mojave, then I eventually got it to work again using the solution here.\nHow to render only first page in PDF as image and then resize?\nNow I'm trying to upgrade to Monterey, and it's broken again, and I can't figure it out this time.\nAny ideas would be awesome.\nIf possible, I'd like to come up with a solution that Apple won't break every couple years, but experience has taught me that is unlikely.\nI've been messing with this for days.\nScreenshot of my application attached below.\nAnd here is the complete script I'm using.\n\n#! /usr/bin/python\n#\nimport sys\nimport os\nimport tempfile\nfrom Quartz.CoreGraphics import *\nfrom os.path import splitext\nfrom os.path import basename\nfrom os.path import join\n\n\ndef createPDFDocumentWithPath(path):\n    return CGPDFDocumentCreateWithURL(CFURLCreateFromFileSystemRepresentation(kCFAllocatorDefault, path, len(path), False))\n\ndef main(argv):\n\n    for input_pdf_filename in argv:\n        doc = createPDFDocumentWithPath(input_pdf_filename)\n        page_one = CGPDFDocumentGetPage(doc, 1)\n        mediaBox = CGPDFPageGetBoxRect(page_one, kCGPDFMediaBox)\n        if CGRectIsEmpty(mediaBox):\n            mediaBox = None\n\n        file_name, extension = splitext(basename(input_pdf_filename))\n        output_path = join(tempfile.gettempdir(), file_name + extension)\n        writeContext = CGPDFContextCreateWithURL(CFURLCreateFromFileSystemRepresentation(kCFAllocatorDefault, output_path, len(output_path), True), None, None)\n        CGContextBeginPage(writeContext, mediaBox)\n        CGContextDrawPDFPage(writeContext, page_one)\n        CGContextEndPage(writeContext)\n        CGPDFContextClose(writeContext)\n        del writeContext\n\n        print output_path\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main(sys.argv[1:])\n\n\n\n\n\nA: \nI think it had something to do with Quartz not being included in\nMonterey.\n\nQuartz is part of macOS's core graphics framework.

Since maybe iOS 15 through iOS 16, sometimes these prompts randomly appear in notification cards for apps on the iOS lock screen:\n\nI always want to receive all notifications and never want to mute any conversations, but since this comes up randomly, sometimes I might accidentally tap \"Mute...\".\nHow can I make it so that these prompts never appear?\n\nA: There are a few things you can try to make these prompts show up less often.\nFirst, you could start engaging more with notifications from the apps you're being prompted to mute. One of the reasons you might be getting the option to mute notifications is that you aren't responding to those notifications in the first place. If you open some of the notifications from the app in question, you should see less of the \"temporarily mute notifications\" prompt.\nSecond, and counterintuitively, you could try clicking the \"mute\" button to turn off notifications, and then manually turning notifications for that app back on from your settings. From anecdotal experience, if you select the \"not now\" option, it seems the prompt will simply continue showing up later. Instead, try going along with the prompts but then reversing your notifications back to your desired settings immediately afterwards.\nThird, make sure none of your notifications are set to the \"deliver quietly\" option. Some people have suggested that the mute notifications prompt comes up more often when your apps are set to deliver notifications quietly. If your Slack notifications are set to deliver quietly, for instance, try turning off that feature to see if it reduces the unwanted prompts.\nSource: https://www.iphonetricks.org/stop-temporarily-mute-notifications-on-iphone/\n", "Q: What is the authoritative source of \"Passwords\" in iCloud / Where exactly does the authoritative database live? I have iCloud \"keychain\" enabled on both my Mac and my iPhone. However, iPhone \"Passwords\" did not match my stored passwords in Safari, despite using Keychain cloud sync.

I assume it must be in a datacenter somewhere (cloud storage) since I deleted the local DBs on my Mac....unless it pulled the old DB from my iPhone?\n\nA: The authoritative source the is iCloud Keychain. It’s a database of passwords just like the keychain on your mobile device, Mac, or Windows computer. The only difference is you can’t access the database file like you can on your local device -  it’s a service.\nWhen you sync one device (your Mac for example) it will upload all your keychain entities. You do this by enabling iCloud Sync on the device. As you as more devices, it will sync each one with iCloud being the central repository.\nIf/when you synchronize and there is a conflict with an entry (happens, but not often), it will stop syncing and create a “Sync Issue” alerting you to the problem allowing you to resolve it.\nWhich database takes precedence?  The one you select. If you turn off syncing on your local device it will ask you to keep or delete the saved passwords. If you delete everything and turn back on sync, everything from the cloud will be downloaded. Keep in mind, it will take the most recent records as “current.“\n", "Q: Change audio input and output devices from terminal I'd like to be able to change my audio inputs / outputs from the command line so that I can script my studio setup.\nIs it possible to change the selected audio input / output in MacOS from the command line?\nPreviously, someone on StackExchange posted a clever AppleScript to do this.

I have a 14\" MacBook Pro with 512GB of internal storage, but I feel like this is not enough for my needs.\nI recently acquired a broken 14\" MacBook Pro with 1TB of internal storage and am considering replacing the 512GB SSD in my MacBook Pro with the 1TB SSD from the broken MacBook Pro. My concern is that doing this will void the warranty or cause Apple to deny me service in the future due to the mismatch between the specification associated with the serial number and the actual storage in the computer.\nI will not be able to keep the other memory module as I plan on selling the broken MacBook Pro, so I won't be able to switch the 512 GB module back before sending my MacBook in for service.\nIs it possible to replace the 512GB SSD in my MacBook Pro with the 1TB SSD without voiding the warranty or causing any issues with future service?\nI asked Apple if they void the warranty for opening my MacBook Pro, and surprisingly they said that they don't. I did not ask them about replacing any parts, worried that they might make a note of that on their account and possibly deny me service in the future since I showed an interest in tinkering with the MacBook.\n\nA: \nIs it possible to replace the 512GB SSD in my MacBook Pro with the 1TB SSD without voiding the warranty or causing any issues with future service?\n\nLegally speaking, yes.  You are protected under the Magnussun-Moss Warranty Act.  A manufacturer cannot void a warranty if you made modifications to your product without proving that said modification directly contributed to the failure to be covered under warranty.\n\nEven those “Warranty Void” tamper evident stickers have no legal teeth. No company can prevent you from opening a product you own.  They will, however, put them on in the hopes you won’t challenge it in court.\nPragmatically speaking, the important question is will Apple honor the warranty repair after you’ve made the modification?\nLikely not.  While the law is on your side, Apple can simply say “No” and (incorrectly) support their decision by pointing to their policy. You’ll need to involve a lawyer at that point and I wouldn’t be able to advise you if the “juice is worth the squeeze.”\nNow, understand that I am not a lawyer, I don’t play one on YouTube or TV, and most importantly, I’m not your legal council!!

When I copy/move files to it, in Activity Monitor's Memory section process diskimages-helper Memory column (usage) becomes exactly what the size of a file I copied is (as verified by ncdu and Disk Utility's Used: section for that RAM disk volume).\nThe problem is that when I delete a file from my RAM disk, Memory used by diskimages-helper does not go away. The only way to free it up is to either eject the RAM disk volume or kill the diskimages-helper process (practically the same thing).\nFrom my research, as I continue to copy/move/remove files to/from my RAM disk the diskimages-helper memory usage grows untill it hits the 4GB mark (the amount allocated to the RAM disk). Once again, deleting files from RAM disk does not free up any memory used by diskimages-helper.\nThe question is then, how can I get my RAM disk/diskimages-helper process to only use the memory needed? And subsequently release whatever memory used to be allocated to now deleted files? Command line answers are preffered.\nNote: RAM disk file system ideally has to be APFS or another sparse file capable file system.\nTo be clear, I'm not looking for a way to limit diskimages-helper's memory usage, as I can do so by simply changing my RAM disk size. The intention is to get diskimages-helper to only use whatever amount of memory is actually occupied by the files currently stored on the RAM disk (similar to how RAM disk/tmpfs works on Linux).\nThere was a similarly looking question with a key difference though, as this one is solved by simply ejecting the ram disk which frees up allocated memory.\nHow do I get the memory allocated to a ramdisk back?\nPotentially unimportant background:\nI use a streaming app called infuse, and it caches the entire movie/episode of whatever I watch/stream from my server. I do not want my already worn out SSD to carry the burden, so I'm using RAM disk for this app's cache directory. Please refrain from suggesting app-specific fixes, alternative apps, and such, the purpose of this question is to sort out RAM disk and diskimages-helper behaviour.\n\nA: I signed up to answer this question; it's the first time I've actually known the answer.\nEach volume has its own bin (trash). When you delete something from the RAM disk, that's where it goes. If you empty the bin (trash) or open it and delete the file from there, that should give you your RAM back.\nSorry that's not your preferred Terminal solution. For that, I navigated to a folder deleted from RAM disk and found it inside a mysterious 501 directory, which was inside .Trashes (not .Trash).

There is an action for setting the volume. There will certainly be other ways of setting the specific values you want, like using defaults write commands in the Terminal.\nmacOS has a \"Focus\" feature, that lets you disable notifications and other disturbances, and you can set the Focus level in Shortcuts, too.\nSystem Settings has an option to \"Optimize Battery Charging\", which will hold at 80% if you leave it plugged in for a few days. And there is a Low battery warning at some relevant level. You don't need to manually manage the battery. It's much larger than a phone's, so the tolerances and lifespan are much greater.\n", "Q: Is there any way to make the menu bar on macbook floating?

I want to export some notes as PDFs or any other type of text file to save them locally, but when I go to File -> Export as PDF... it shrinks down the note page width, meaning the lines of code and my notes look completely different than what I have formatted them to look like.\nI am not 100% sure, but if I remember correctly, about 6 months ago I, somehow, managed to retain the width of the note window and its dark background while exporting a note.\nHow can I export my notes with the correct formatting?\nMacOS Monterey / version 12.6 / MacBook Pro 2016\n\nA: Try:\nPrint > Uncheck  Rewrap contents to fit page > PDF > Save to desired location\nThis seems to retain the original formatting. As far as background goes, I doubt it is an option to natively export a dark mode-themed PDF as printing such a page would be a massive waste of ink.

I found another MBP, same version exactly, from a friend of mine. I would like to know if I can replace my screen with the one from my friends laptop.\nAm I able to do it or I will face any problem with serial numbers?\n\nA: Apple now allow 3rd party repairs with certain kit, in as much as they will supply parts and tools. See https://support.apple.com/self-service-repair\nThe same advice as for https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/448825/221742 applies here, although this isn't a duplicate, you're asking about the screen.\nNote that the prerequisites for doing it properly are quite comprehensive.\n\nA: \nAm I able to do it or I will face any problem with serial numbers?\n\nCurrently, MacBook Air/Pro components are not serialized like the iPhones are1.  You can obtain replacement parts like the display assembly or top case assembly (keyboard and track pad) without needing to “marry” the component to the logic board.\nSo, in short, yes you can use your friends donor machine for parts.\n\n1Is This the End of the Repairable iPhone?, iFixit News, October 29, 2020.\n", "Q: Does any iPhone take advantage of higher current limits for USB Battery Charging ports? A USB Battery Charging port can deliver 1.5 A of current at 5 V. My iPhone 8 for instance came with a 1 A charger, so I can't assume that it'll use more than that from a USB A socket (it can however use USB Power Delivery with a USB C cable).\nDo any iPhones take advantage of the higher current from a USB Battery Charging port?\nWikipedia has this to say about USB Battery Charging:\n\nThe charging device identifies a charging port by non-data signaling on the D+ and D− terminals. A dedicated charging port places a resistance not exceeding 200 Ω across the D+ and D− terminals.\nPer the base specification, any device attached to a standard downstream port (SDP) must initially be a low-power device, with high-power mode contingent on later USB configuration by the host. Charging ports, however, can immediately supply between 0.5 and 1.5 A of current. The charging port must not apply current limiting below 0.5 A, and must not shut down below 1.5 A or before the voltage drops to 2 V.\n\nEdit\nSo, if a device draws more than 1.5 A of current from a USB A port then — to me — that suggests that the device is not in spec with regards to USB Battery Charging which, according to the above quote, can deliver a maximum of 1.5 A. My conclusion would be that in that particular instance the device is using some other scheme of determining how much current to draw. That doesn't preclude the existence of support for BC as well, naturally.\nI took an interest in USB charging recently while repairing a USB A power bank, and started wondering whether this BC standard is actually being used by devices. Since I have an iPhone I thought it would be a good candidate to ask about.\nWhile I get the impression that my phone does take advantage of higher current, it is purely anecdotal and that also doesn't preclude the possibility that it's using some proprietary method.\n\nA: \nDo any iPhones take advantage of the higher current from a USB Battery Charging port?\n\nYes.  I know from my own personal experience (using a USB meter) that the iPhone 7 plus draws up to 2.1A at 5V. I never had the chance to test it, but I do remember the iPhone 6 would “complain” that it would charge slowly if I used a charger with less than 1.5A capacity.\nApple has an iPhone comparison tool that will allow you to obtain the Tech Specs for models from the iPhone SE (1st gen) to the latest model.  From what I can tell, all iPhones starting with the iPhone 8 support fast charging meaning it takes advantage of the higher current rates.\n\nso I can't assume that it'll use more than that from a USB A socket\n\nYour phone will only draw what it’s capable of drawing and the adapter is capable of delivering.  If only 1A is available from the USB adapter that’s all the phone will draw. Higher amp adapters will have the data pins shorted with the 200ohm resistor to “tell” the device that higher wattage is available.\nNewer USB-C chargers that conform to the PD spec (power delivery specification) will negotiate the charge rate with the device. They will require USB-C adapters of at least 18W (18 / 5V = 3.6A)\n", "Q: MacBook Pro screen border repair I had a little accident with my MacBook Pro (dropped it).  The screen is working fine (no problem with screen display so far), it did not break but the little bar like \"border\" that contains it, is the one who took the damage and looks like this:\n\nIs it reparable? How much would it cost (considering the screen is working and did not break)?\n\nA: The MacBook Pro display is an assembly of glass (includes the border) “glued” to the LCD panel.  This means that to repair the glass you either need to replace the assembly or have the ability to remove the glass panel and re-glue it with the specialized adhesive in an industrial oven.\nIn short, replacing the glass isn’t a DIY project, however if you have decent tech skills, you should be able to replace the LCD assembly.\nThe glass will continue to shatter and is quite dangerous.  It’s best that you get it replaced sooner rather than later.\n", "Q: I can't play my German Aladdin Broadway CD I really liked the original soundtrack of the Aladdin Broadway musical, so I wanted to listen to all of the songs in German.

I also tried playing it on a Sony boombox, but it also didn't play.\nWhy doesn't it play? Will I be able to get songs off of it?\n\nA: I would try adding to library in itunes.\nbefore you start, change your preferences in itunes:\nprefs - General - Import settings use 'AAC encoder' and setting 'iTunes plus'.\nCheck the 'use error correction when reading Audio CDs' checkbox.\nThis will give your CD the best chance of being read by skipping over any minor flaws in the CD\nnow you're ready to import your CD to iTunes\nFile - add to library -\nwhen it asks for the file and opens a finder window, insert the cd while holding down the command key, it should read the CD at this stage.\nif it doesnt you probably have a hardware problem with your external reader or your CD is faulty.

How can I stop the screen dimming on macOS Ventura, everytime I unplug the MagSafe Charger on my 2021 MacBook Pro?\nIs there any way to disable this weird energy saving feature. I want my screen to stay 100% no matter what is the charging status.\n\nA: In macOS Ventura settings, you have to go to Displays, then click on Advanced..., then toggle off \"Slightly dim the display on battery\".\nHowever, the display still gets dimmed if you have Low Power Mode enabled, so make sure it's disabled in the Battery settings.\n\nA: On Ventura, it's System Settings -> Displays -> Advanced -> Slightly dim the display on battery.\n\nA: I think there is a setting for that in the system preferences. Under \"screens\" -> then \"advanced\" in the bottom right. There is a setting at the bottom that states something like \"dimm brightness slightly when using battery\". That should do the trick.

I mean earlier it won't last a second without being plugged in. Now it lasts for nearly 25 minutes. Coconut battery app shows the battery health is about 3.1 % now which was earlier reduced to 0 % (My MBP system stats still show my battery health as 85%). Could this be a software or minor hardware issue?\nI took it to the Apple Service Centre and the guys told me that I'll need to get the complete keyboar (which comes with battery) replaced for this and that will set me back by 510$ which is pretty high in my opinion in India.\n\nA: That battery is dead.\n\nEarlier, its battery health started falling abnormally from 95 to 85 percent while charge cycle counts being 124 only.\n\nFirst, battery count is just a convenient convention for users to gauge the longevity of a battery.  It “should” last 1000 cycles assuming you fully charge and discharge the battery every time.  A certain number charge cycles is not a hard and fast (nor guaranteed) number.\nThe fact that you saw a massive drop in capacity was a clear sign that your battery was rapidly failing. It’s a chemical reaction and there’s no certainty as to the life span or rate of deterioration.\nYou can expect 3 to 5 years life out of a battery. It can fail much sooner or much later; the average lifespan is within 3 to 5 years.  Given that you are barely pushing the three year mark, it’s clear your battery is dying prematurely of the median battery life expectation.\nThe important question is, are you still covered by AppleCare?\nGiven that your particular model is pushing 3 years old even with a low cycle count, it’s not unexpected that your battery needs to be replaced.  So, if you have an AppleCare plan, your battery is covered.  If not, you’re on your own for the repair.\n\nIt seems this is repeated issue with some M1 MacBooks which Apple hasn't identified yet.\n\nNot really.  Based on the above information, this is not unusual and not considered a defect to identify. I highly doubt Apple will do a recall or implement a service program for this. Looking at that site, there’s only one MacBook battery recall and it’s for overheating, not for lifespan or capacity.\n", "Q: How to implement a GUI based Linux (XUbuntu) linux on arm Mac M1 processor I want to install a software which predominantly uses GUI, and is available across all the platforms.\nInterestingly, this software does not function properly on the Mac M1 natively, even with Rosetta. Therefore, I want to activate the GUI on a virtualization environment on a Linux Guest and Mac M1 host. I made the following unsuccessful attempts -\nAttempt 1 With Virtualbox for M1 processors\nIn this attempt, I installed the VirtualBox beta version for M1/M2, then I used the Ubuntu ISO AMD 64 version; the installation did not proceed at all. It throws a hard disk error and shows something regarding UUID being unable to register.\nAttempt 2 with Multipass\nI was able to install Multipass with Homebrew and was able to activate the machine with the CLI. However, when I attempted to install the xubuntu-desktop and xrdp (as documented on Multipass's website, I was not able to gain access to the GUI interface.\nAttempt 3 with UTM\nI attempted to use the ARM-based distro of Ubuntu and yet there was no success even with this; it just fails to install.\nTherefore, the farthest I have been able to go is to activate the CLI. How can I get the GUI to work on M1 on macOS?\n\nScreenshots of VirtualBox\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit: Just to add, VirtualBox is working fine with Linux Guest and MacOS host on the Intel processor on another PC.\n\nA: From the nature of your question, it seems like you want first of all an easy to use solution for first time users. In that case, I would suggest Parallels Desktop.\nThere is a free, 14-day trial version. The full version of the software costs €99.99 for home users.\nAfter installing Parallels Desktop, you can select to create a new virtual machine. You will be given the choice of automatically installing included, ready-to-go Linux distributions for ARM. You can choose from Ubuntu, Fedora, Debian and Kali.\nThis will give you a full installation of Linux - including the GUI - and you do not have to know how to install Linux. It is done automatically.\nUPDATE:\nFrom your comments, you indicate that you are not a first time user of VirtualBox. In that case, I would again recommend Parallels Desktop, but if you must go with VirtualBox then remember to download the ARM64 version of Ubuntu.\nYou list in the question that you have tried installing the AMD64 version of Ubuntu in VirtualBox on the M1 Mac. That will not work, as it requires an Intel-compatible CPU in order to work. You can install it using CPU-emulation, but that would not be workable in practice. Use the ARM64 version and you'll get (more than) decent performance.\n\nA: There is a project to build a Linux version designed for Apple Silicon Macs, called Asahi Linux.\nYou may have more luck with this on the bare metal.\nhttps://asahilinux.org/about/\n", "Q: change mutiple xml fields data and the data have differnt name #have try apple script #on mac Scenario description\nThis side needs to go to a ftp regularly to download the data down\nand change their fields.\nThe process is:\n\n*\n\n*Download from a place to get a file name called \"202301081014XXXX.REQ\" data format xml\n\n*change the data of one of the fields of S001 which content is \"1234\"\nChange it to \"abcd\"\n\n*If the change is completed, create a file with the same name and name it as\n\"202301081014XXXX.REQ.OK\"\n4.Upload the two created data to another ftp path\n\nCurrently I have tried the action\n\n*\n\n*via Mac app script tools\n\n*The operation of recording the screen is as follows\n\ntell application \"Finder\"\n    activate\n    open document file \"202301081014N1234.REQ\" of folder \"Downloads\" of folder \"blue2\" of folder \"Users\" of startup disk using application file \"BBEdit.app\" of folder \"Applications\" of startup disk\nend tell\ntell application \"BBEdit\"\n    activate\n    open find window\n    find \"<S001>1234</S001>\" searching in text 1 of text document id 829 with selecting match\n    set characters 406 thru 428 of text document id 829 to \"<S001>abcd</S001>\"\n    select insertion point after characters 406 thru 428 of text document id 829\n    save text document id 829\nend tell\n\nProblems encountered\nBecause the names of the data are different, I have read the official documents but I don't know how to define the scope.\nAnd the <S001> field is in a different position, so I can't execute the recorded AppleScript.\n\nA: Trying to record the UI is problematic at best, and can include extraneous statements and varying types of references.  A better option is to look at an application's scripting dictionary (if it has one) to view the functionality it exposes - BBEdit has support for most of its functions.\nIn addition to an ID, windows and documents also have an index, which is their display order.  The front object is always 1, so that can be used instead of trying to figure out a unique ID.\nThe find command will return a record containing a reference to the character range of a match, and also has an option to select it - those can be used instead of hard coded character offsets.

Ventura's menus are very different from previous versions of the OS.\nI attempted the deletes by majorgear and when I launched Google Chrome again after reboot, 2 items in LaunchAgents were back in that folder and the notices started again.

If yes, should I use a USB 2.0 socket or USB 3.0?\nAlso I have another cable with a male Apple iPhone connector and a male USB C connector. Can I use it to charge the iPhone from any third-party charger that has a USB-C output? Or my laptop's USB-C socket?

Can I use this charger with that USB-A to Apple cable to (fast?) charge my iPhone?\nI realize that the best is to go and buy an original Apple charger, but at this time all shops are closed, and I need my iPhone urgently.\n\nA: Yes.  Technically, You can use any USB charger (or port) to charge your iPhone.\n\n*\n\n*If your charger supplies less than 1.5A it will charge, but slowly.\n\n*If it supplies 2.5A it will “quick” charge\n\n*If you are using a USB-C PD (Power Delivery)charger with at least 18W, you can Fast Charge where you get up to 50% charge in 30 mins\n\nAs far as cables, any data cable will do.

What settings do I need to change to ensure that all displayed text can be selected and copied, as was previously possible?\n\nA: The developer of the app controls this and if it’s a web view, you might be able to add an extension to strip whatever JavaScript they are using to protect things    but that only works for me in safari - not embedded web browsers delivered in an app.\nThere is no OS / system setting to disable pasteboard copy and selection operations.\n\nIf you were to make a screen shot of the chat, new iOS features make that live text selectable, so you might need that system feature if the developer will not make their apps accessible to screen reading and copy operations.\n", "Q: Mac Mini limited bluetooth range I have an M1 Mac Mini that I recently set up as a utility computer in a downstairs room. My wife likes to listen to music while working (not working on the computer, she's an artist) and my idea was to use a JBL Flip bluetooth speaker that she could easily move around. However, the speaker would only work within maybe 15 feet of the computer at best, maybe less. Those speakers work with phones over much greater distances.\nThere's this question that suggests an extender; is there anything else I can try that doesn't involve additional hardware?\n\nA: Frustrated by the limited range, I googled around. Apparently people have a lot of problems with Bluetooth devices on the Mini, though other than the speaker issue I've been OK. However one of the things I read mentioned that the antenna is on the bottom of the box, under the black plastic ring.\nI tried setting the thing on its side, which made a mess of the cables, but that made a tremendous difference in the range for the speaker, at least 3x. Also the speaker previously would stutter sometimes even when close to the computer, but with the thing on its side (and the black ring aimed generally towards the rest of the space I want to use it in) it's rock solid.\nSo I picked up an aluminum stand to make that setup more stable, and I'm very happy. This may not work for everybody, but I figure it might help at least a few people.\n", "Q: Clicking a button in Safari using AppleScript Here is the overall goal.

I tend to agree with this idea, as this mac has seen a lot of software upgrades in the past and doing a fresh install will help clean out the cruft.\nThe next step would be restoring user accounts and data.  Here I can see two possibilities, and I don't know what is the preferred technique:\n\n*\n\n*Individually restore the user accounts/data from the time machine backups I made prior to the surgery.\n\nOr:\n\n\n*Plug the HDD that I extracted from mac into a USB 3 enclosure, and use that to restore the user accounts/data.  But for this option I don't know the relevance of the cache SSD.  Is it just superfluous now?\n\nreiterating my questions:\n\n*\n\n*After removing the spinning HDD, do I just leave the SATA cable flopping around?\n\n\n*When restoring user accounts/data, should I just use my time machine backups, or use the spinning HDD I removed?\n\n\n*If I use the spinning HDD to restore data, is teh fusion drive cache SSD relevant any more?\n\nUpdate\nThis is the process that I took, and what I noticed during the updating of my Mac Mini\n\n*\n\n*I opened my mac only enough to replace the SSD part of the fusion drive with the new SSD.  I left the HDD part of the fusion drive in the chassis.\n\n\n*After re-assembling the system, I powered it on and issued an Opt-Cmd-r recovery command via my Apple wireless keyboard.\n\n\n*When the recovery dialog came up, I selected restore from the Internet and Monterey.\n\n\n*The new SSD was the only option I had for an install location, so I selected that.  (There was no option to format the new SSD, and after the fact I saw that it was formatted as APFS.  I am not sure if this is how the SSD was originally formatted). Then the installation started.\n\n\n*Then things got weird. The installation stopped and I was shown a screen that alternated between two different graphics.  There was no text explaining what this all meant.  After some thinking I realized that that these graphics were prompting me to turn on the power switch of either my keyboard or mouse.  It seemed that at this point in the installation the installer had lost communications with   the wireless keyboard and mouse.  After hunting around I found a wired USB mouse, and plugged that in, and the installation continued.\n\n\n*Eventually I got to the point where the installer asked about restoring data from some other source.  I selected to restore from a Time Machine backup, and plugged in one of my TM backup disks into the USB port.\n\n\n*I elected to restore 1 Admin and 1 non-Admin account.  I was prompted to reset the password of the Admin account, and I selected a new password. But the installer created a new (temp) password for the non-Admin account, and suggested that I write it down.  While I did do that, when the system was fully restored, the new non admin account password didn't work, and all I can think of is that what took to be a \"l\", was in fact a \"1\". In my opinion, the font used for the password was not very good.  But not to matter as I could use the admin account to force a password reset.\n\n\n*The installer then started recovering the data from the TM backups.\n\n\n*The recovery process seemed to take a long time, although I noticed that it had found something like 1 million files to restore.\n\n\n*Eventually it completed.  I logged in with my admin account, did a password reset of the non-admin account, and then logged back in with the non-admin account.\n\n\n*After all my emails were re-imported into Mail, I needed to re-enter the passwords for my email accounts in order to bring them online.\n\n\n*There was a lot of files copied to a \"relocation\" folder that I need to check over (but not sure how to check them right now).\n\n\n*The only thing that doesn't seem to be working is VirtualBox, but I expected that to happen due to needing a kernel driver to be installed.\n\n\n*The HDD part of the fusion drive is showing as Not Mounted and  Type: Unknown, Owners: Disabled.  I may bring that online later.\n\n\n*Once everything else was done, I noticed that there was an update to Safari available, so I installed that.  Obviously Apple hasn't generated a new Monterey image since Safari was updated.\n\nA: This all centres around \"Is a Fusion drive usable if it's been physically split?\"\nNo.\nI used to think it was, but it really isn't, they're married in such a way that breaking the bond loses all data.\nSo…\n\n*\n\n*May as well, it will make no practical difference so long as it can't foul any moving parts.\n\n\n*Migrate from Time Machine, at first boot with your newly-installed OS. Don't set up accounts first, or you get doubled accounts & a data nightmare.\n\n\n*Not applicable.\n\nA: Yes, there's no issue with having an internal SATA cable that's not connected to anything. (Alternatively, you could even swap in a 'standard' 2.5\" SATA SSD for maximum capacity.)\nTo clarify the point: Fusion drives only work together. As soon as you remove one device (of if one of them breaks), then each single device is useless on its own and cannot be read individually. The SSD is not a cache: it contains data that isn't on the hard drive part.\n", "Q: Using the home or side button of the Apple Watch in a shortcut I'm currently trying to create a shortcut that skips to the next song in the Music app when I press the home (or maybe side) button.

Due to my professional workloads, I am unable to use MacOS as my primary OS but really love the MacBook Pro's high quality hardware and battery life so I'd like to find a way to make it work.\nI am looking for a way to run GUI Linux on my MBP (I have tried Asahi with the experimental GPU drivers and I cannot wait for it to be daily drivable - but things like webcam support\nare essential).\nI noticed that Apple offer various tutorials on getting up and running with Linux through their Virtualization framework - including adding Rosetta2 support.\nhttps://developer.apple.com/documentation/virtualization/running_gui_linux_in_a_virtual_machine_on_a_mac\nI realise I will probably sacrifice performance and battery life doing this, but it's better than not being able to use my laptop for work at all.\nIt also seems possible to share the GPU with MacOS guests, I am wondering if this is the case with Linux guests?\nIs the best option to use GPU paravirtualization via Parallels?\n\nA: Yes, it is possible to have GPU hardware acceleration for Linux guest VMs on Apple Silicon macOS hosts using Apple's Virtualization and/or Hypervisor frameworks.\nThe most straight forward way of achieving this is virgl. As you mention, getting a license for Parallels Desktop is if not the best option, then probably the easiest option. It features automatic installation of Linux guests and easy setup of GPU hardware acceleration.\nIf you want to stick with FOSS, you can enable GPU acceleration within the guest in a relatively easy manner using homebrew-qemu-virgl.\n", "Q: Why does Asahi Linux require disabling security features to be installed? When I install a second instance of MacOS (say I am experimenting with a beta or something), I just create a new APFS partition and install MacOS in that partition.\nThe MacBook bootloader seems to know there is another OS on that partition and displays the options to boot from it.\nWhen installing Asahi Linux, I run a script that partitions my drive, but I also have to place the MacBook into \"permissive\" security mode via recovery to complete the installation.\nWhat is permissive mode?\nWhy must the MBP be placed into permissive mode?\nDoes this put your MBP at significant risk and how would you sell this to a company's security team?\n\nA: \nI also have to place the MacBook into \"permissive\" security mode via recovery to complete the installation.\n\nThis is a misconception. You are not placing the MacBook into \"permissive\" security mode. You are placing the Asahi Linux install into permissive mode.\nApple Silicon Macs implement a unique secure boot mechanism that is unlike other personal computing devices. Typically devices are either wide open, locked down to manufacturer-approved software only, or can be toggled between those states through some (sometimes more, sometimes less secure) mechanism. Apple Silicon machines instead implement the security mode separately for each installed OS as part of a framework called Boot Policy, and this is what the available security modes mean:\n\n*\n\n*Full security: Will only boot Apple-approved OSes, and installation requires phoning home to Apple (which allows them to revoke old vulnerable software versions from being installed again)\n\n*Reduced security: Will only boot Apple-approved OSes, but any such OS ever released can be installed without any phoning home.\n\n*Permissive security: Will only boot User-approved OSes, where approval requires physical presence and authentication. Secure Boot is still enabled, but now it is you who chooses what to authorize, not Apple.\n\nDue to the way the mechanism is designed, new OSes must first be installed in Full security (from macOS) or Reduced security (from an existing recoveryOS) mode before being downgraded to Permissive security later. This must be done from a strictly controlled recoveryOS instance, and there are many requirements:\n\n*\n\n*It must be an Apple-signed recoveryOS\n\n*It must be the same version (from the point of view of the machine) as the OS being downgraded\n\n*It must be an instance installed with and paired with the OS being downgraded\n\n*It must have been launched by a very specific procedure, involving holding down the power button from a cold shutdown state to prove user presence\n\n*The user must enter their credentials, which must have been authorized as a machine owner (typically an admin user of an existing macOS install).\n\nAt that point, security of that specific OS can be downgraded, and the actual custom OS bootloader can be installed. This process locally signs the new OS bootloader with a cryptographic signature, so replacing it can only be done by following this process again. This gives you the ability to have a fully user-controlled, securely booted, third-party OS. Of course, such third party OSes need to implement a full secure boot chain for this to be as secure as macOS (Asahi Linux does not yet, but it's been planned from day one and will at some point).\nThe Asahi Linux install process is, essentially, this:\n\n*\n\n*Create a new APFS container\n\n*Install a \"stub\" macOS (downloaded directly from Apple's CDN), of our own chosen version, containing everything but the root filesystem (this includes recoveryOS and all components needed to run it, as well as the iBoot bootloader and OS-paired firmware that cannot be replaced in a third-party OS install)\n\n*Install Asahi Linux (EFI/ext4 partitions). This is inert at this point.\n\n*Authorize the fresh stub macOS to be bootable on this machine. If you are installing from macOS, this will go through the phone home process behind the scenes and authorize it in Full security mode. If you are installing Asahi Linux directly from a recoveryOS Terminal, it will instead prompt you for login credentials and jump straight to Reduced security mode (which is as low as you can go from an unpaired recoveryOS belonging to the wrong macOS install), avoiding the phone-home step.\n\n*Mark the new OS as the default boot option and ask the user to boot into recoveryOS (hold down the power button). This will, implicitly, boot into the fresh recoveryOS instance that was just installed, which is the only environment that can authorize a change to Permissive security for the new OS. The Asahi Linux installer uses a trick to make this more ergonomic for users, so it looks like you are selecting the Asahi Linux install and it goes straight into the setup script instead of you having to pull up a Terminal and launch it manually, but you still have to be in the right recoveryOS (which is what you get by holding down the power button). Note that the \"boot picker\" that lets you choose an OS is already a running recoveryOS!\n\n*Change the security mode for this OS to Permissive security, prompting the user for credentials in the process\n\n*Finally, install the Asahi Linux bootloader (which locally signs it and authorizes it to boot on this machine - this is a local process, no phoning home), again prompting for credentials.\n\nAt that point you reboot and you're in the new OS.\nSo how does this affect the security of other OSes on the machine? It doesn't. Your existing macOS install remains at Full Security, with all the privileges that entails (like being able to run iOS apps and watch DRM-protected content). The OS image itself is still signed by Apple and verified at runtime, and cannot be compromised from Linux. User data can be if you have not enabled FileVault (though in practice we don't have support for APFS with transparent encryption anyway, so an attacker would have to develop that first!). If you have, then the most the third-party OS can do is just destroy/corrupt your data, not extract or compromise it.\nEnabling FileVault also has one additional benefit in that it forces recoveryOS to prompt you for credentials upfront, which means you cannot use that environment to break into your machine or bypass password login requirements.\nSo, these machines are designed so you can do this without compromising the security of your main OS. Whether you can successfully sell that to your company's security team, that's a different question :-)\nYou can find a more detailed description of the Apple Silicon security architecture on the Introduction to Apple Silicon page on the Asahi Linux wiki.\n", "Q: Will there be no more printed books for macOS Support Essentials Ventura (ACSP exam)? The book series was called \"Apple Pro Training Series\" I took the Apple Certified Support Professional (ACSP) exam very long time ago. I learned quite a bit, was able to eliminate gaps. However, the exam was not very difficult.\nNow I want to take the exam again for the current Ventura release. I saw on the Apple website that a lot of iOS specific topics are represented in the exam. That's where my gaps are and I want to close them.\nThe industry has gone towards online training, but I prefer a printed book (it's a old habit).\nDoes Apple no longer print books for the certifications? Or do I just have to wait since Ventura was a relatively fresh release? Does anyone know the current status?\n\nA: The Apple Pro Training Series is now published by Peachpit (part of Pearson).  The most recent is macOS Support Essentials 12. Based on the last two years, we might expect the Ventura version in March.\n", "Q: iPad extend to monitor I have the following iPad mtxn2b/a with 16.2 installed.\nWhen I plug in a monitor, it dupliacates the screen but I can't find anywhere in the options to extend onto the monitor to fill the entire screen.\nIs this supported by my iPad?\n\nA: You can use your iPad as a second display for your Mac.  It’s called Sidecar.\nYou cannot extend your iOS/iPadOS Desktop to a second screen.  You can mirror it or transmit it via AirPlay. The iPad simply doesn’t have the GPU horsepower to drive two separate displays like you’re accustomed to on a desktp.\n", "Q: How to resolve this problem (access to invisibles folders) when using AppleScript? For example:\ntell application \"Finder\"\n    activate\n    set fNo to folder \"usr\" of (path to startup disk) -- don't work\n    set fYes to folder \"Library\" of (path to home folder) -- works\nend tell\n\ngives\nerror \"Erreur dans Finder : Il est impossible d’obtenir      folder \"usr\" of startup disk.\" number -1728 from folder \"usr\" of startup disk\n(error in Finder: unable to obtain folder \"usr\" of startup disk.\" number -1728 from folder \"usr\" of startup disk)\nSetting fYes works probably because a gain access to my user Home in a previous attempt, but I forgot where/how.\nSo how can I grant the required access rights to the script?\n\nA: The issue isn’t about Ventura, or security, but visibility.  Scripts using the Finder don’t normally see invisible items, the same way they are not normally shown in Finder Windows.  For an example, your sample script works (or not) when using the commandshiftperiod shortcut to toggle showing invisible items.  An alternative would be to use System Events.\n\nA: As the user red_menace pointed out, the folder I tried to access has a particularity: it is \"invisible\" (grayed out in Finder when acceded and displayed via Go > Go to Folder... menu item; type \"/usr\" in recent macOS to access to it).\nI tried to access to it via AppleScript by the \"folder ... of folder ...\" command and this failed.\nBut there is another method to specify a folder  in AppleScript. And with this another method, all runs smoothly without fail.\nHere is the method which works (perhaps others too).\ntell app \"Finder\"\n    activate\n    set fNo to alias \"Macintosh HD:usr\"\nend tell\n\nI discovered this by testing the setting \"fNo\" to the folder with the AppleScript \"set fNo to choose folder\" (and in the choosing window, enter command+shift+G, and then type \"/usr\" in the prompt). And then I discovered  that in the Result part of the Script Editor window, fNo was in fact alias \"Macintosh HD:usr\", so I tried directly this successfully.\n", "Q: How do I delete a note from Notes.app using AppleScript? I would like to delete any notes in Notes.app that are older than two weeks. However, the following code results in an error, \"Can’t get item [X] of every note.\":\ntell application \"Notes\"\n    set mainFolder to folder \"Notes\"\n    set cutoffDate to (current date) - (14 * days)\n    repeat with aNote in notes\n        if container of aNote = mainFolder then\n            if (creation date) of aNote is less than cutoffDate then\n                delete aNote\n            end if\n        end if\n    end repeat\nend tell\n\nI've tried to move the note into the \"Recently Deleted\" folder, but I get a similar error that the script can't \"get\" the note. What am I doing wrong?\n\nA: Your syntax is a bit awkward. If you used this, then it would likely work. That said, it is 'getting' the list of notes each cycle. This isn't inherently bad but it's not good and could modify the results.\ndelete item 2 of (get notes)\n\nSome things to consider:\nTry using a list to represent the notes. As you delete notes, the contents of notes changes so the results should be more predictable when you work from a static list. For example, this should also work.\nset nList to notes\ndelete item 2 of nList\n\nGenerally, if you can do things that are unrelated to the application in question, try and do them outside of the tell block. In this case, calculating a date is unrelated so set it beforehand.\nSince all of the notes to delete are within the same folder, loop through that folder rather than through every note. You can remove the related if…then statement.\nTo help track the deleted notes, I added 'xList' to record those being deleted. When run from Script Editor, the list will appear in the Result. If you plan on running it in some other manner, you would need to explicitly provide the results (e.g. display dialog, save item names to text file). Of course, all of the deleted notes should appear in the 'recently deleted' folder but so would any other recently deleted note which might skew your understanding of what the script deleted.\nThis should achieve your purpose:\nset cutoffDate to (current date) - (14 * days)\ntell application \"Notes\"\n    set mainFolder to folder \"Notes\"\n    set nList to notes of mainFolder\n    set xList to {}\n    repeat with aNote in nList\n        if (creation date) of aNote is less than cutoffDate then\n            set end of xList to name of aNote\n            delete aNote\n        end if\n    end repeat\n    xList -- list of deleted notes\nend tell\n\n", "Q: Summary of network activity For a while I used network monitor that comes with MacOS to understand the network activity of apps. But things don't add up there. For example, in the attached screenshot total “Data received“ is 1.4 GB and total ”Data sent” is 52.8 MB. However, if I accumulate the “Sent Bytes” and “Rcvd Bytes” columns of individual process, it does not come close to the overall number.\nI would like to have summary of my network activity which includes\n\n*\n\n*Process that upload / download the data\n\n*How much data is that process has uploaded / downloaded.\n\n*What are the URLs / ip address  the process is uploading the data to or downloading the data from.\n\nAnd I want the data to match up to the number in bottom right corner of the network activity tool. Is there any tool for MacOS that will give me the information I am looking for?\nEdit (Additional context): When I took the screen shot, my Mac was turned on for less than an hour and activity monitor was open the whole time.\n\n\nA: I wouldn't use Activity Monitor for this, as anything more than a very rough guide.\nIt doesn't differentiate between LAN & WAN traffic. Also, the totals are since boot, the individual figures are since you first opened the tab.\nI usually reboot every month or two, but this has only been up a week. Look at the massive discrepancy already present. I load Activity Monitor at boot, but almost never use the Network tab. This picture was taken about a minute after switching to it. mDNS seems to have a large usage, so perhaps that's constantly being recorded, but I have other processes down the list that I know for certain have shifted gigabytes of data since last boot.\n\n", "Q: HDMI to DisplayPort adapter for a M1 MacBookPro At my new job I received an Apple MacBookPro to work on. Some specs: 16-inch 2021, Apple M1 Pro CPU, one HDMI port.\n\nThis Mac has USB-C ports and does not have any legacy mini DisplayPorts.\n\nCan you recommend me an adapter (not a cable) HDMI male to DisplayPort female, to connect to my office DisplayPort-based monitors? Most of my google searches returned the exact opposite adapters (i.e. DisplayPort male to HDMI female) and I have no clue if they are compatible with \"my\" Mac.\nI'm asking for an adapter because I have a docking station with a power adapter, essentially two bricks, which are not something I would like to carry with me every day.\nIt seems some clarifications / updates are needed:\n\n*\n\n*I'm not interested in all Apple history and how they moved one technology to other platforms/device versions/etc -> I want an adapter that works with my config.\n\n*I want something that is not device dependent so that I could use it with a video card if I want, or another windows/linux notebook (which might not have usb-C), that's why I've asked for an adapter from HDMI.\n\n\nA: Updated Answer\nYour latest edit has changed your question to focus more on converting HDMI to DisplayPort and less on your Mac itself. In fact, you actually state \"not device dependent\". IMO, you should have posted your question at superuser instead.\nAfter a quick google, I found Cable Creation offers the HDMI to DisplayPort Adapter with USB Power (SKU: CD0764). With respect to needing power, you should read my updated answer to your other question.\n\nBTW: USB type C ports are the future. Current and future Macs and PCs will use this port for the following:\n\n*\n\n*As a DisplayPort which can be converted to VGA, DVI, HDMI, etc through the use of adaptors and/or active/passive cables.\n\n*USB 1.1, 2.x, 3.x and 4.x which may require an adaptor.\n\n*Thunderbolt 3 and/or Thunderbolt 4.\n\n*Power Delivery.\n\n\nOrignal Answer\nThe HDMI port is for connecting the Mac to a monitor or similar device which also has a HDMI port. Since you want to connect to a DisplayPort-based monitor, you should use one of the USB Type C ports. When connected properly, a USB Type C port on your Mac operates as a display port.\n\nNote: The cable or adaptor needs to support DP alt mode which is also supported on your Mac.\n\nAn example cable would be the StarTech.com® CDP2DPMM6B 6' USB-C to DisplayPort Adapter Cable; Black.\nBrand: StarTech.com\nModel: CDP2DPMM6B\n\nThe description contains the following:\n\n*\n\n*USB-C to DisplayPort adapter cable: Your MacBook Pro has USB Type C ports and the monitor has a DisplayPort.\n\n*for use with USB-C devices that support DP alt mode: This would be your MacBook Pro.\n\nI suppose an alternative would be to use an adaptor such as USB-C to DisplayPort Adapter 8K 60Hz. The description given also explicitly states the use of DisplayPort alt mode. Here you would also need a DisplayPort cable.\nBrand: Cable Creation\nModel (SKU): CD0719\n\n", "Q: MacBook Pro M1 HDMI to VGA adapter At my new job, I received an Apple MacBookPro to work on. Some specs: 16-inch 2021, Apple M1 Pro cpu, one HDMI port.\nCan you recommend me an adapter (not a cable) HDMI male to VGA female, to connect to VGA monitors?\nI have a HDMI to VGA adapter (produced by Well) that's working for Dell notebooks, but not on my Mac; so, I would like to avoid buying another incompatible one. The adapter works with the docking station I also received from my company, but having essentially 2 bricks and an adapter ... is not something I would like to carry with me or continue seeing on my desk.\nIt seems some clarifications / updates are needed:\n\n*\n\n*I'm not interested in all Apple history and how they moved one technology to other platforms/device versions/etc -> I want an adapter that works with my config.\n\n*I want something that is not device dependent so that I could use it with a video card if I want, or another windows/linux notebook (which might not have usb-C), that's why I've asked for an adapter from HDMI.\n\n\nA: Updated Answer\nI have a 2018 Mac mini with Mojave installed. I have an old Akai HD TV which is connected though the TV's HDMI port to the Mac. The connection to the Mac has been either directly to the Mac's HDMI port or USB type C port through an adaptor.\nI recently updated the Mac to a Mojave/Ventura dual boot arrangement. Under Ventura, the TV's HDMI port is not longer compatible with the Mac. This is true regardless of whether I use the HDMI port or an USB type C port on the Mac. So, I learned the following.\n\nThe HDMI connection can be dependent on the version of the operating system you are using.\n\nThe TV has a VGA port, so I purchased the j5create JDA203 HDMI to VGA Adapter with Audio (Model JDA203), shown below.\n\nThe printed documentation, which came with the adaptor, stated external power was probably not required when used with a PC, but may be necessary when used with a Mac. Sure enough external power was needed, which is not included with the adaptor. Due to the distance between the Mac and TV, I powered the adaptor using a old phone charger, which was plugged into a 120 VAC outlet. From this, I learned the following.\n\nThe HDMI port on your Mac may not be capable of powering your adaptor.\n\nFinally, the adaptor could not read the available resolutions from the TV and therefore could not report the available resolutions to Ventura. This was solved by temporarily attaching the adaptor to a (assumed newer) monitor, selecting 1080p from Ventura, then moving the adaptor back to the TV. This fix work well until power was removed from the adaptor, which resulted in the 1080p resolution setting being lost.\n\nOrignal Answer\nSimilar to you other question,\nLike your other question, you should use an adaptor which supports DisplayPort alt mode. Your Mac has USB Type C ports which automatically switch to supply DisplayPort signals when the appropriate monitor (or other device) is connected by the corrected cable and/or adaptor. For example, there is this adaptor which explicitly states the use of DisplayPort (DP) Alt Mode.\nBrand: StarTech.com\nModel: CDP2VGAW\n\nIf you prefer, you can also use a cable. For example, there is this cable, which supports DisplayPort (DP) Alt Mode.\nBrand: Plugable\nModel: USBC-VGA-CABLE\n\nIn this case, there is a chip in the cable which acts as the adaptor. The description given in the above link states the following:\n\n\"DisplayPort signaling is converted to VGA by a chip in the adapter cable.\"\n\n", "Q: Working with Shared Folders & Files on Mac I use shared folders on different computers for work. All mac machines. I pull folders from the shared folders. I do the work that needs to be done. Then I drop the work back into the shared folder so others can get to them. Most of the time it works fine. There’s no problem. When there a problem is the work files act as if the are locked. All permissions are set to all read and write with all the enclosed items unlocked too. Neither users can retrieve the work files. Or they completely disappear when dropping them in. What’s going on?\nAll the general work arounds doesn’t seem to help in regards to shared folders. Hope for some suggestions from anyone that may have experienced this problem before.\nThanks.\n\nA: Manually moving files in this way might not be the best way of working, and may be the root of your problems. Are the files on the server set to allow EVERYONE to read and write?\nEither use one Mac as a server and open the files directly from there; or synchronise local copies of the files on multiple Macs.\nThis is really where using a NAS or Cloud storage comes into its own.\n", "Q: How to reinstalled macOS Sierra from USB Start-up Disk made using TransMac I have a MacBook Air 7.2 early 2015: i5 2.4GHz, 8Gb DDR3, 121Gb SSD which is completely empty and I want to reinstall macOS on it. I booted my USB key under Macos Sierra from a dmg file with TransMac, but it doesn't appear as an option in Startup Manager.\nAfter checking the key in Ubuntu, I finds that the EFI partition is empty (0 bytes out of 230 mb), which I think is the cause.\nThe internet resolution offers me as a reinstallation macOS Monterey, and it seems impossible to me with the quality of connection that I have.\nHow can I get the Sierra installer to boot from a USB drive?\n\nA: There are ready exists the question How can I download an older version of OS X/macOS? which is similar to your question. However, since you used TransMac, I assume you are trying to create a bootable Sierra installer from a Windows machine. In this case, there is this answer which is for El Captain, but should also work for Sierra. Where necessary you would need to substitute Sierra for El Capitan in the instructions.\n", "Q: monitor calibration I'm trying to run the display/color calibration utility on my 2018 MacMini for a Dell U2415 monitor (I've also trued this with my BenQ PD2700Q with almost identical results) connected via DP and having a very hard time. I'm hoping I'm doing something wrong rather than the whole process being flawed.\nI run into trouble at the very first gate... well second, technically. I am able to turn my contrast all the way up as instructed, but when I try to reduce the brightness so that the oval is just barely visible, I get down to 0% before the condition is met. The instructions say to decrease the brightness if the right half of the box appears lighter than the left. As you can see in this photo of my screen (taking a screen grab did not capture the darkness), this is the case, but I am already at 0% AND the entire screen is incredibly dark.\n\nI know the photograph doesn't really show anything accurately, but just for reference... to show how dark the Dell is, here it is with contrast at 100% and brightness at 0% (right half of box is still brighter than the left) next to my BenQ restored to factory defaults. At the very least, this should show how dark the Dell is with the instructions still telling me to decrease brightness.\n\nHas anyone else run into this? Or have any advice for getting at least ONE of my monitors calibrated for a halfway decent print preview?\n\nA: The 'by eye' calibration is very approximate, even if you hold Opt as you click the Calibrate… button to gain more precise control over colour balance & gamma.\nIt's really difficult to screenshot this, for many reasons, including that any existing profile is bypassed as soon as you start into the assistant, yet the embedded profile in the screenshot is still the one your display is normally set to, but something like this is OK for starters.\n\nUnless your display has a really offset gamma, the relative brightnesses of these elements really shouldn't change too much with brightness. If you can get closer using contrast, give that a go.\nWithout a meter you don't have an optimum 120cd/m2 brightness to aim for anyway, so this is always going to be just a rough calibration. I'd just start by setting brightness to look approximately like your other screen.\nAs you progress through the Assistant, you'll probably notice that it's really tough to find an exact match. Squinting to make the image blurred can help, but you'll find you have to waggle each slider to help you decide where the mid-point is, when it looks about OK.\nYou may even have to go through this two or three times, then pick the 'best' one afterwards. It is a very inexact science, doing it this way.\nHonestly, though, even if you go through the advanced [hold opt] calibration, you are not going to get close enough for accurate pre-press, or even really web sRGB.

I upgraded to 12.6.2 and I magically was gifted the expected 100GB back to me.\n\nA: Giving your description of the situation (that it is a Jenkins build slave), and that your screen shots 82 GB of purgeable storage - it is likely that the space is taken up by local Time Machine snapshots.\nI.e. in order for the system to be able to backup files to external storage that will be connected later - then files that have been deleted are actually still taking up disk space in the snapshots. When you backup to external storage, those snapshots will be removed automatically.\nFor a Jenkins build slave, you'll often have tonnes of files being created and instantly removed - and you would never miss those files or want them to be backed up. In that case, you could want to manually remove the snapshots.\nTo check if this is actually the case, open up the Terminal and run this command to list snapshots (if any):\ntmutil listlocalsnapshots /\n\nYou can delete them afterwards using tmutil deletelocalsnapshots for a given date.\nUPDATE\nSince it was confirmed that snapshots are not the issue, I would recommend opening up System Settings > General > Storage and let it calculate the size of each category. Perhaps this overview can shed some light on where the space went.\nYou can press the \"Optimise\" button on this page to see if macOS can automatically purge unnecessary data (such as for example downloaded movies that have been watched).\nFor good measures, I would also check your Bin and ensure it is empty.\nIf the problem persists, I would try using a utility to determine what you're using the space for. A program such as OmniDiskSweeper or Disk Inventory X is very useful:\n\n*\n\n*OmniDiskSweeper\n\n\n*Disk Inventory X\nMake sure you are logged in as an Admin user while using these programs, and ensure you're scanning the entire disk.\nIf you have multiple user account created on the Mac, the storage could have been used up by another user.\n", "Q: Using wired LAN and need to use AirDrop I've got an iMac and I use the wired LAN (Ethernet) port.\nI also want to use Airdrop, which requires WiFi.\nIs there a way I can configure the network settings to use wired LAN for all traffic apart from AirDrop.\nThe iMac is running Big Sur.\n\nA: Yes this is possible, I do it all the time!\nYou can configure priorities in the network section in your system preferences.

It is running macOS Mojave 10.14.6.\nI replaced the battery once with a battery purchased from Amazon.\ncoconutBattery is reporting, as of right now, as having:\n\n*\n\n*Full Charge Capacity: 7121 mAh\n\n*Design Capacity: 7200 mAh\n\n*Manufacture Date: 12/12/2016\n\n*Cycle Count: 68\n\n*battery status: Good\n\nThe problem is that it drains extremely fast. I have tried Ubuntu on it as well, no luck. Even the previous version of macOS on this system (High Sierra).  I did a full battery drain, charged to 100% and still no luck.\nWhile turned off, I held down Shift + Control + Option + power button. I held it for about 10+ seconds, I release and the MagSafe LED turned from orange to green for a few seconds, then back to orange.\nI thought it was the battery, so I ordered another battery from Amazon. The same issue.\nThis is making me believe that maybe some kind of connection is bad on the battery, or the Mac is having some strange issue. I know it's an old laptop, but it's been one of my favorites and I carry it around whenever I am in an area where it could be stolen. The replacement battery from iFixit is about $70, but I don't want to deal with it if it's the Mac.\nAny ideas what I can try?  I remember the battery life was amazing way back when I bought it.\n\nA: The tell-tale here is that a brand new battery behaves in the same way. Even a cheap 'imitation' Apple battery should work correctly on day 1, at least.\nThat suggests that it's a hardware problem.

(I know that's very low for MacOS). I checked with Disk Inventory X and Grand Perspective and it got the same result.\nIs this some sort of glitch or malware?\nIs this because my Mac cleared up some old cache or time machine backup?\nOr is it some sort of corrupted data or data loss?\nDoes anyone have any idea why?\n\nA: This is most likely some cache or similar being released (APFS snapshot, auto-trash-emptying,...).\nE.g. iCloud (assuming you use iCloud services) uses caching to have files readily available, instead of having to download them every single time. Of course, it does not download your whole iCloud, but tries to figure out which files you need the most often.\nAnother possible scenario is auto-updates, where the update would be automatically downloaded and installed.\n\nIs this some sort of glitch or malware?\n\nThese questions are really hard to give a definitive answer because theoretically this could be malware, but what are the chances? Close to 0.\n\nOr is it some sort of corrupted data or data loss?\n\nUnlikely.

This happens after a reboot or when it was shut down - at first, it was enough to unplug it once and then it was recognised again. Next day it was three times and today it worked briefly after maybe 30, but after another restart stopped working again.\nAt first I thought it might be a software issue with Karabiner.

Is there something else I might try? Maybe some kind of preference reset so it will forget it was ever plugged in?\n\nA: \nI have tried every USB port, USB hub and a small USB to USB-C reduction, booting in safe mode - but it just wont get recognised... any other keyboard works.\n\nYour keyboard is dying.\nYou’ve done enough diagnostics to eliminate any other possibility. The fact that “any other keyboard works” tells you that your keyboard has failed/is failing.\n", "Q: How to double-tap to select a word? Very frustrating problem. I have a new MacBook Pro/Ventura. I haven't been able to consistently double-tap to select a word. This occurs in all text applications. When I tap, the vertical bar insertion point falls between letters and  the second tap does nothing. If I third-tap, the entire paragraph is selected. Then I have to back up and start over. It may take 5 tries to actually select the word. It seems like the cursor can only recognize a letter if it initially falls on the center of a letter, otherwise it falls off into the abyss between letters. But as I understand, there is no \"empty space\" between letters.\nI've been using MacOS/OSX for 20+ years and never seen this behavior, but it is really slowing down my workflow. I've adjusted all the available sliders for trackpad speed and accessibility. It can't really be a hardware problem because the same thing happens with external trackpad!\nWhat am I doing wrong?\n\nA: Although this does sound like a speed problem, have you looked at the main settings for the trackpad? That's not in Accessibility but in Trackpad > Point & Click. I would look at \"click force\" and \"Tap to click\" and see if that changes the behavior.\nThe other thing to try is to set up a new account on this Mac and see if the double-tap works. If it does, then you know there's something wrong with your installation. Either some part of the operating system has become damaged or you're running some kind of softer that's modifying how the pointer behaves.\n", "Q: White part of screen flicker and drop shadow is weird, any setting need to change?

If the problem doesn't go away, then you have a hardware issue.\nA flickering screen is hardly ever a software or setting issue especially when it starts all of a sudden.  This is indicative of a hardware issue - likely your LCD panel.\n\nwhite does not look white and the drop shadow is inverted on white background.\n\nIf colors don't look right especially white (which is all colors of the pixel being illuminated) then this is also indicative of a hardware issue - the LCD panel or your GPU.\n\nAny way to disable drop shadow?\n\nThis question has been asked/answered:  Remove Window Drop Shadow and Replace with Outline\nHowever, this isn't the solution.  You simply cannot fix a hardware issue with a software hack.  If your display is giving problems, it's only a matter of time before it fails completely.  Your best bet is to get it checked out so you can determine if you should repair or replace your Mac.\n", "Q: Does FileVault work if I use iCloud My question is the following: If I use FileVault, will it only protect the data which is not uploaded to the iCloud, or will files uploaded to the iCloud be encrypted? If all files stored in the iCloud can be accessed through the iCloud, then setting up FileVault only makes limited sense, right?\nThis is given the fact that I do not store my key in the iCloud, of course.\n\nA: iCloud and any other computer system writes data to your local disk and reads it back later when you try to access the file. FileVault encrypts the data when it is written, and decrypts it when it is read.\nFileVault is a local encryption system, designed to protect against someone stealing your computer. Without FileVault, someone could access your files with physical access to your computer.\nYou are correct that it does not have any effect on the files stored in iCloud, while they are in the cloud. However, the local copies of the files will be protected in the same way as any other file.\nYou should always set up FileVault, since it will protect the files that are locally stored on your computer.\n\nA: iCloud and FileVault really don't rely on each other.\niCloud is encrypted by default.  Someone would have to have your authentication credentials to access your files in iCloud.  You encrypt your local machine with FileValut to ensure anyone who gets their hands onto your machine has an infinitesimally small chance of accessing your data.  FileVault is about encrypting your local files.\nFor further details regarding iCloud Security, see Apple Support: iCloud data security overview:\n\niCloud uses strong security methods, employs strict policies to protect your information, and leads the industry in using privacy-preserving security technologies like end-to-end encryption for your data\n\n", "Q: Node module doesn't work as intended with automator shell script I am trying to start a live-server on demand in any folder temporarily with automator, and kill it when I'm done.\nLive server is a node package.

However, after updating to Ventura, it now says that I do not have necessary permissions, even after disabling SIP.\nI've tried to set app limits in screen time, but it only allows me to set a time limit instead of restricting access completely, and even then I could just turn screen time off.\nIs there any way for me to prevent Safari from being opened or otherwise being used for browsing?\n\nA: In the Screen Time settings, set a \"Screen Time Passcode.\" This is a 4-digit pin code you enter to lock Screen Time from being modified.\nThen, in Screen Time > Content & Privacy (enable if disabled) > Content Restrictions, set \"Access to Web Content\" to \"Allowed Websites Only.\"\nSafari will still open, but will be unable to navigate to any webpages.\n", "Q: Why does Safari make netflix screenshots black? What legal agreement or other reason does Apple have that makes them want to stop users from being able to screenshot netflix in Safari.app?\n\nA: Netflix uses DRM to protect its content in Safari. Because Safari offers this DRM, Netflix allows higher-quality playback.\nIn Edge & Safari, Netflix playback allows 4K playback. In Chrome & Firefox, they do not.\n\nA: The DRM is handled at the source; there is no contract or agreement per se with Netflix to prevent screen captured.\nNetflix uses Google’s WideVine.  Apple has FairPlay. Microsoft offers Azure Media Services DRM so that anyone who hosts with them can protect their content. AWS, likewise has a similar offering.\nThe Content server encrypts the transmission stream at the source. Your player (running on macOS) decrypts the stream.  Screen Capture can’t decoded this video stream.  Your Apple device and macOS actually supports hardware based DRM:\n\nApple FairPlay only offers hardware DRM in two flavours: baseline for HD content and main for UHD HDR content.\nMost devices and browsers those days can support hardware DRM, including:\n\n*\n\n*Chrome for Android\n\n*Safari for macOS, iOS or iPadOS\n\n*WebViews for Android and iOS\n\n*Smart TV\n\n*Video game consoles\n\n\nEmphasis Mine\nApple has a vested interested in protecting its own digital content so they have an added motivation to support and implement other DRM technologies.  In addition, HDCP (High Bandwidth Copy Protection) is a technology licensed by Intel.  It is not far fetched that the license agreement Apple entered into specifies that it must protect against circumvention like screen captures.\n", "Q: CPU spikes due to power management? I have a late 2013 6-cpu Mac Pro running Big Sur. Within the past month or so, I'm getting cpu spikes lasting 5-10 minutes.

All the threads were blocked waiting on machine_switch_context, a couple were in some forced idle call and one looks like it was in some queue wait.\nSo what's changed over the past couple months? A couple of Big Sur updates, and the addition of MS office software; I really needed ms remote desktop functionality. Also updates from Avid, their bg processes use a lot of resources.\nAny ideas or suggestions? It wouldn't break my heart to remove MS if I can find a suitable RDC replacement.\nBTW, has anyone noticed the swastika-like nature of the MSRDC icon? Just sayin'\n\nA: You should consider that the change might not be due to software you have installed over the course of a few months - but instead from hardware issues.\nIf the system cannot provide sufficient cooling for the CPU, the power management software inside the kernel will try to idle the CPU in order to bring down the CPU temperature. This could be triggered by for example a build up of dust in the system fan, the system fan failing or near failing, and similar.\nThe \"trash can\" Mac Pro has a single, big fan that cools the entire system.

I have no idea how does it work, but here is what I did:\n\n*\n\n*Connected USB Hub\n\n*Plugged USB-C cable into it\n\n*Monitor connected\n\n*Remove USB Hub\n\n*Connected cable directly\n\n*Monitor connected again\n\nIt's pretty strange behaviour\n\nUpdate: after I've connected this monitor to my PC I'm unable to connect monitor to Macbook again. So - problem was not resolved\n\nUPDATE 2: Solution that resolved issue:\n\n*\n\n*Completely shut down monitor.\n\n*Remove cable\n\n*Shut down macbook\n\n*Wait for some time (In my case it was about 8 hours)\n\n*Plug in cable to macbook\n\n*Turn on macbook\n\nThis solution described multiple times at different forums. But in my case I had to wait more than 5-10 minutes while my MB is off. And I still have no idea how does it work\n\nA: I’ve been battling with the same problem and after reading posts about this issue I believe it’s MacOS Ventura’s fault. No solutions I found helped so I’ll try to downgrade my macOS as a last resort.\nCheck out this detailed thread: Upgrade from BigSur to Ventura macbook pro not detecting external monitors and TVs\n\nA: Your monitor should support USB-C without having to go through that \"dance\" shutting down, disconnecting, waiting, and reconnecting.  Per the specs page on LG's website:\n\n\n\n\nINPUT\n\nOUTPUT\n\n\n\n\n\nHDMI\nYes x 2\nDisplayPort\nYes x 1\n\n\nUSB Type-C\nYes\nHeadphone Out\nYes\n\n\nUSB-C (DP Alternate Mode)\nYes\nUSB-C (Data Transmission)\nYes\n\n\nUSB Down-stream\nYes x 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBelow are some items you want to check.  I can't tell you how many times (from extensive professional experience) replacing a simple cable fixed troublesome issues.  It's always good to start with quality connections.\n\n*\n\n*Get a USB-C cable that supports DisplayPort Alt Mode.\n\n*Try a USB-C to DisplayPort cable and connect to the DisplayPort interface (not USB-C Alt). In my experience, DisplayPort has always been a reliable technology.\n\n*Ensure you're running the latest firmware of your monitor.  LG Software Downloads.\n\n*Verify this problem doesn't exist on a different computer (like a Dell laptop).  If it does, then this is definitely a monitor issue and not macOS.  This will help you focus your efforts going forward.\n\nWhen purchasing cables/adapters, always go for reputable brands like StarTech, Cable Matters, Belkin, Cable2Go, Pluggable, etc.  They cost more, but their quality is much higher than the no-name discount brands.  Many times you may purchase what seems like a decent cable, but to save costs, they remove support for certain features.\n\nDespite all the capabilities ... it is important to note that not all USB-C products support USB-C’s full functions.\n\nSource:  BenQ USB-C FAQ\nHopefully this will get you working or at least pointed in the right direction of a solution.\n\nA: I came across an article on how to fix macOS Ventura/Monterey not detecting external monitor.\nApart from the method you have taken, it also recommends that you do the following:\n\n*\n\n*Allow Accessories to connect to USB-C connections.\n\n*Boot into Safe Mode.\n\n*Update the hub driver or software.\n\n*Change screen resolution.\n\n*Update your Mac.\n\n*Disable 'Automatic graphics switching'.\n\n*Downgrade macOS\n\nMaybe you can try one of them to get your issue resolved.\n", "Q: Numbers not sorting names correctly For some reason I’m having issues sorting column D. When I tap “Sort Ascending” it sorts everything correctly except books 5 and 7:\n“12, 13, 14, 15 16 17, 18, 22, 23, 5, 7”\nI’ve tried deleting all the “Tintin” sells and then recreating everything with the same issue.\n\n\nA: The sort order is \"correct\":\n\n*\n\n*Numbers are sorted by value.\n\n*Text is sorted in lexicographic order.\n\n\"The Adventures of Tintin #5\" is (obviously) not a number, it is text and is therefore ordered lexicographically.\nLexicographic order means comparing the first element, if they are equal, comparing the next element, and so on, until you find the first difference (which determines the sort order) or you run out of elements (in which case the shorter one comes first). So, the text \"#5\" comes after the text \"#23\" for the same reason that the text \"#e\" comes after the text \"#bc\".\nWhat you want is natural sort order, which sorts text including digits by treating digit sequences as numbers.\nFor example, in lexicographic order, the text \"ab12c3\" would be treated as 6 characters:\n\n*\n\n*the character \"a\"\n\n*the character \"b\"\n\n*the character \"1\"\n\n*the character \"2\"\n\n*the character \"c\"\n\n*the character \"3\"\n\nWhereas in natural order, the same string would be treated as five elements:\n\n*\n\n*the character \"a\"\n\n*the character \"b\"\n\n*the number 12\n\n*the character \"c\"\n\n*the number or character \"3\" (doesn't really matter for single-digit numbers)\n\nUnfortunately, it seems Numbers does not support natural ordering despite one lone guy on the entire WWW claiming otherwise.\nYou will have to implement something yourself. You can do one (or more) of the following:\n\n*\n\n*Split the column into the text and number parts: How to sort column by numbers in Numbers?\n\n*Create a separate sort key in a hidden column.\n\n*Add leading zeroes so that the numbers are always the same length, i.e. have the same number of digits.\n\nNote that numbers aren't the only tricky bit about sorting text. Just some random examples: in Germany, there are two different ways to order Umlauts which are used in different circumstances. So, where to sort my name, depends on context. The Netherlands and Belgium share a language but disagree about how to sort names: one would sort a name like \"van Hoorn\" under \"v\" and one would sort it under \"H\" (but still keep the \"van\").\nDenmark originally used the digraph \"Aa\" for an /å/-vowel, but switched to \"Å\" in 1948. However, in limited cases, it is still allowed to write \"Aa\". \"Aa\" is sorted the same as \"Å\", as a single letter at the end of the alphabet. But only if it is also pronounced as an /å/-vowel. In loan words or proper names from other languages, where \"Aa\" is pronounced as a long /a:/-vowel, it is treated as two separate letters \"a\" and \"a\". Which means in a list of place names, the German city of Aachen would be sorted near the top, whereas the Danish city of Aalborg would be sorted near the bottom.\nOh, except that did change at some point, so today Aachen and Aalborg would both sit at the end of the list. Which means, it not only depends on which culture you are sorting in, but which time as well.\nHuman language is weird.\n", "Q: How do I change from PHP 7 to 8 when using Homebrew?

Months later, now that project's backup disk is full, and I have finally bought a new backup disk for my own laptop. I need to free up the space again on the project's backup disk, for the project.\nI tried formatting the new disk and was surprised to find that Apple now recommends using APFS to format time machine back ups. I did this, I used the new format in reformatting the disk. Now though when I try to drag my backup from the old backup disk, I get a pop up that says \"The volume is the wrong format for a backup.\"\nIs it not possible to move old laptops to an old disk? Do I just need to backup from scratch and delete these months of backups (I do have 2 other backup disks in other locations so that's not the biggest of deals, but it still rubs me the wrong way to lose data.)  Or should this work? Would it work if I just reformat the new disk with the old (deprecated?) Apple \"extended journaled\" format?\n\nA: OK, I hacked around, it turns out that you do indeed just have to make EXACTLY the same format as the disk you are copying from for Apple to let you drag & drop between disks. I'm sure there are other ways to do it, but for now I'll just stick with Apple's disk format.\n", "Q: Time Machine inherited, but UID changed After a clean install of Ventura, I have manually transferred data from when the same Mac had Monterey.  I then used tmutil inheritbackup to reconnect to the same external backup disk that I had been using.  That command was successful.  However, it turns out that my account on Ventura has a different UID than it did under Monterey (despite having the same name).  From the resulting mismatch, I not only can't continue from the previous backup, but I have lost access to all the backed up data on the external disk.  Is there a way to repair the UID mismatch?\nClarification: Just to add to the challenge, the Mac is bound in a domain, making low level changes to the new install dicey-to-impossible.  So a full solution would have to adjust the TM backup instead.\n(Preemptive comment: No need to preach the Migration Assistant gospel.  It might well have been a better choice, but that is water under the bridge.)\n\nA: You can change the UID from the System Preferences \"Users & Groups\" panel. Unlock the panel and then right-click on your username and choose \"Advanced Preferences\". As long as there is no other user with the same UID, this should not be a problem.\nConsiderations:\n\n*\n\n*If the previous user on the machine is archived, as opposed to completely deleted, the UID will still be active and will conflict.\n\n*You should create a new user (UUUser), log out completely (not just switch users), then log in as UUUser, to perform this change. Then log out completely, log in as you.\n\n*IMHO, there is a serious risk of unintended consequences, and I am in no way going to test this solution. See my comment to your question. See here for detailed discussion.\n\n\nA: I found one answer to my question at this archived page, which is old but still would probably still work.  It involves rejiggering the new install to match the old TM UIDs.  Unfortunately, in my current case the old TM UID is crazy-large (423890409).  I don't know why, maybe something about my organization.  But I haven't found any way to specify the UID while creating an account.\n", "Q: How to copy line in bullet point list without the bullet point? My workflow involves lots of lists. I think in lists, I write my notes in lists.\nAn example note in my apple notes might look like\n\nHere are the commands I need to Run!\n\n*\n\n*echo \"this is a command\"\n\n*cat /tmp/some_file.txt\n\n\nAnd very often I highlight the bullet point line, copy it, and paste it elsewhere. In this example, I would be pasting it in a terminal.\nWhat really frustrates me is that every time I copy the line, the pasted output looks like this:\n- echo \"this is a command\"\n- cat /tmp/some_file.txt\n\nThe leading hyphen needs to be manually removed each time. It causes a lot of wasted time for me. I wonder if there is a way to copy a line of text in a bullet point without the leading hyphen?\n\nA: With the bulleted text already on your clipboard, this following command in Terminal.app will remove the first 2 characters (the hyphen and the following space) from each line that is currently on the clipboard and copies that back to your clipboard.\npbpaste |sed 's/^..//g' |pbcopy\nSo instead of typing the above command every single time… in Terminal.app, you can create an alias for that full command so your new alias would run the full command.\nFor example in the following code, i assign the keys pt to run the full command.\nalias pt='pbpaste |sed 's/^..//g' |pbcopy'\nNOTE: In Terminal.app, before creating a custom alias, make sure it is not already being used so as to not over write an already existing command.  To check if pt as I used above, isn't already being used, the command type pt lets me know if it has been already assigned or not.\nSo now in Terminal.app, when i type the command pt it removes the first 2 characters from my clipboard.\nNow anywhere I decide to paste the text, the bullet or hyphen and the following space will be removed.\nSo now If I want to paste the \"un-bulleted\" text in Terminal, I type the command pt then hit Enter then Command + v.\nIt will really come in handy if you have multiple lines with bullets on your clipboard\nOPTION 2: (My Choice)\nCreate a new Automator.app Quick Action and add a \"Run Shell Script\" action to the workflow.  Next, paste this following code into that new Action.\nosascript -e 'tell application \"System Events\" to keystroke \"c\" using {command down}' ; sleep 1 ; pbpaste |sed 's/^..//g' |pbcopy\n\nThen save the new Quick Action.

Back in the sixties I actually programmed mainframe computers in assembler language, but those days are long gone. Now I have a 2018 Mac Mini, a DasKeyboard MacSFT 3G7 keyboard, a Kensington Expert Trackball, and a new Wacom One screen tablet.\nI'm currently running Mac OS 10.15.7 (but I realize I need to update to the current OS) and Karabiner Elements 13.7.0. I want to put Affinity Photo on the Wacom screen and at the same time run YouTube tutorials on the monitor screen. Touching the pen to the tablet moves the cursor to the tablet, but I want to be able to press the #3 (upper left) button on my trackball and have it move the cursor to the center of the main monitor when I need to pause the tutorial, etc..\nSo far I have come up with code for a rule which maybe would do this (using the \"to\" code from an example at set_mouse_cursor_position):\n[\n    {\n        \"type\": \"basic\",\n        \"from\": {\n            \"pointing_button\": 3\n        },     [<– This is the only thing I added]\n    \n        \"to\": [\n            {\n                \"software_function\": {\n                    \"set_mouse_cursor_position\": {\n                        \"x\": \"50%\",\n                        \"y\": \"50%\",\n                        \"screen\": 0\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n]\n\nBut I don't know how to test this and I don't know how to add it to the Karabiner [JSON?] file and then I don't know how to get that file where it will actually do its magic.\nIs there anyone here who could test out this rule (and correct any mistakes), add it to the Karabiner Elements complex modifications rules list, and then tell me here where it is and step-by-step how to add it to the Karabiner file/app on my computer.\n\nA: Karabiner's config file is ~/.config/karabiner/karabiner.json. If this file doesn't exist try to add any Complex Modification in Karabiner app via UI just to trigger the creation of the file.\nYou should add your custom rule to profiles.complex_modifications.rules JSON property.\nUnfortunately I can't test your rule right now but if it won't work you should start with some basic mapping (like from one key to another) and make it more complex step-by-step.\n", "Q: How to use a terminal pipe to apply action iteratively and save a file to the same folder as the input? I am trying to recursively find all docx files in a folder (with subfolders) and convert them to pdf using a headless LibreOffice instance. I'd like the output file to be saved in the same folder as the input file. Unfortunately, the output file is always saved in the current directory.\nHow can I save the output file in the same directory in which the input file was located?\nHere are the commands that I have tried:\nfind . -type f -name '*.docx' -print -exec sh -c '/Applications/LibreOffice.app/Contents/MacOS/soffice --headless --convert-to pdf \"{}\"' \\;\n\nI thought it might work by using the --outdir option but the files still get saved in the current working directory.\nfind . -type f -name '*.docx' -print -exec sh -c '/Applications/LibreOffice.app/Contents/MacOS/soffice --headless --convert-to pdf --outdir . \"{}\"' \\;\n\n\nA: Replace -exec with execdir.

I have a stuck DVD in my 'ol [EDIT: external] superdrive, and all the viddys show people taking them apart!\nI expected to see a small hole in the dust curtain indicating were I can use a paperclip to manually eject the disk. But it's not there. I'm fiddling around with a paperclip on the far right side, but I can't find the lever.\nDoes the SuperDrive have a manual eject feature?\n\nIn case you haven't seen this...I have it here somewhere. Ah. Yes. I present to you an Apple Titanium PowerBook G4 optical disk drive. Here you see the visual cue to where you put your paperclip.\n\n\nA: It does, but it's as hard to reach as it is to photograph ;)\nIt's on the left, btw.\n\nIt's slightly below the line of the door, so you need a bent paperclip, curved a bit to reach but not so much that it bends when you push to release the CD mechanism.\nYou also need three hands… one to hold the door open, one for the torch [flashlight] & a third to do the actual pushing, and of course, as soon as you reach in, your block your own light from the torch.\nIf it is on an old Mac Pro as this one is, it actually might be easier to take the side off & pull out the optical drive tray, so you can see & reach simultaneously. [There are no screws etc to this, you just pull the assembly out & push back afterwards.]\nOh… I just realised you meant the external one…\n\nI've never actually seen one of those to know the construction - but it looks very much like you're going to have to strip it apart; unless the old trick of holding down the mouse button at boot will force-eject it. [You may need a wired mouse to do this.]\n\nA: You could try the Terminal command:\ndrutil eject external\n\nOtherwise, reboot and hold down the mouse or trackpad click at startup.\nIf the disk is physically stuck (e.g. the drive audibly tries to eject it, but can't), then there is a trick of taking a business card and pushing it into the slit (just a bit!) and sliding it across the opening while it's trying.\n", "Q: Access System Information about another Mac?

I needed to attend a Webex meeting and by going to the provided address I was given a file to download (Webex.pkg).

Elements Auto Creations 2023 from running altogether I installed Adobe Photoshop Elements 2023, which annoyingly comes with a load of useless crud I do not want, but seems so interconnected I cannot just remove it.  One of this useless (to me) pieces of software is Adobe Elements 2023 Organizer, which seems to run some sort of useless 'auto creation' (of what?!?) in the background.  I ticked all the boxes in the damn app preferences to stop it from doing so, but it still does.  I also disabled Adobe from running automatically in the System Setting to no avail.\nSo the questions:\n\n*\n\n*can I altogether remove Adobe Elements 2023 Organizer without stopping Photoshop Elements from working?\n\n*if no, can I at least totally disable  Auto Creations from running in the background?\n\nI am on Ventura, on a M1.\n\nA: Yes, you can remove Adobe Elements 2023 Organizer without affecting the functionality of Adobe Photoshop Elements 2023. The Organizer is a separate program and is not necessary for Photoshop Elements to function properly.\nTo remove Adobe Elements 2023 Organizer, follow these steps:\n\n*\n\n*Quit Adobe Photoshop Elements 2023 if it is running.\n\n*Open the Applications folder on your Mac.\n\n*Locate Adobe Elements 2023 Organizer and drag it to the Trash.\n\n*Empty the Trash.\n\nAfter completing these steps, Adobe Elements 2023 Organizer should be completely removed from your system.\nIf you prefer not to remove the Organizer, you can disable Auto Creations from running in the background. To do this, follow these steps:\n\n*\n\n*Open Adobe Elements 2023 Organizer.\n\n*Go to the Edit menu > Preferences > Auto Creations tab.\n\n*Uncheck all the boxes under Enable Auto Creations.\n\n*Click OK to save the changes.\n\nThis should disable Auto Creations from running in the background.\nNote that disabling Auto Creations may affect certain features in Adobe Photoshop Elements 2023 that rely on it, such as the \"Auto Creations\" tab in the Home screen. If you experience any issues, you can always re-enable Auto Creations by following the same steps and checking the boxes under \"Enable Auto Creations.\"\n", "Q: Location of downloaded voices - primarily used for announcement in Mac I need to delete the voices I downloaded for announcements/speech.

So I have a screenshot of my application, now I need to add some text on top of it, along with a nice color.\nCurrently I am just sending all my pictures to my Windows, in which I am using Paint to do the job. I am a bit frustrated about how hard this is on macOS. I am searching for a FREE program who can do such an easy job, but I am having a hard time. I tried Darkroom, Photos, Paint S, but they all are complicated and I don't see a canvas in which I can drag and drop an image.\nAny suggestions on how to do this on macOS?\n\n\nA: Simple image editors tend not to be canvas-based at all, they are entirely image-based; so the canvas is always the same size as the image itself.\nSo, what appears at first glance to be a simple request is actually more complex than you'd think. More advanced editors such as Photoshop or Gimp can change the canvas size independently of the image size. Gimp is free, cross-platform.\nDownloadable from https://www.gimp.org/downloads/ or there's a more Mac-like build maintained separately at https://www.partha.com [this is always slightly behind the official build versions as the author needs to wait for the official release first.]\nYou can then resize the canvas using Image menu → Canvas Size…\nFull instructions at https://docs.gimp.org/2.10/en/gimp-image-resize.html\n\nA: You could use the built-in Preview app, which has a few editing capabilities. While it doesn't have a canvas per se, you could just copy any image and select \"New from Clipboard\" (or Cmd+N) and then Tools > Adjust Size to stretch your canvas to a desired size. Then select all (or Cmd+A) and hit delete. Now you have kind of a canvas and can start pasting images, add text and simple objects, like squares and circles.\nI've used your image, added a rectangle with both the same border and foreground to overlay the Dutch words and put the English words on top. It's probably not the right font.\nOnce you're done, you can select a rectangle around the final image, crop it (Cmd+K) and save it. Preview is quite versatile in this regard.\n\n", "Q: Macbook Pro A1708 Intel i5 won't update the firmware and remains in black screen I have a 13\" Macbook Pro 2016 non-touchbar with Intel i5 processor on it.

All finished installing but goes to black screen at first reboot after the first online update downloaded and installed. It goes to black screen because the online update contains firmware update and the firmware update does not initiate. At this moment I can bring the laptop back alive pressing Shift Option Command and POWER buttons several times.\nMaybe the boot ROM attempts to update from a very low version to something much greater for it to handle. Can anyone send me a firmware update that is not the latest available but something in between 205... and 499...?\n\nA: According to Apple, the 2016 MBP is not compatible with Ventura. (2017 MBP is earliest.)\nhttps://support.apple.com/HT213264\nI would use the freeware app SilentKnight, which shows what firmware updates are available, and will try to install them.\nhttps://eclecticlight.co/lockrattler-systhist/\nOtherwise, use Apple's Configurator app. You'll need to run this on another Mac, with the target Mac connected by Thunderbolt/USB.\nHowever, a Mac that's had a liquid spill cannot be relied on.\n", "Q: Inaccessible APFS Partition - no gpt scheme In an attempt to recover a different external drive altogether, my drive \"Libraries\" was compromised.

I'm clueless, scared and a complete noob.\nshogunhz@CyXs-MacBook-Pro ~ % diskutil verifyDisk disk4                        \nUnable to verify this whole disk: A GUID Partition Table (GPT) partitioning scheme is required (-69773)\nshogunhz@CyXs-MacBook-Pro ~ % diskutil list disk2\n/dev/disk2 (external, physical):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *5.0 TB     disk2\n   1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk2s1\n   2:                 Apple_APFS Container disk4         5.0 TB     disk2s2\nshogunhz@CyXs-MacBook-Pro ~ % diskutil list disk4      \n/dev/disk4 (synthesized):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      APFS Container Scheme -                      +5.0 TB     disk4\n                                 Physical Store disk2s2\n   1:                APFS Volume Libraries               2.3 TB     disk4s1\nshogunhz@CyXs-MacBook-Pro ~ % sudo gpt -r show disk4\nPassword:\n       start        size  index  contents\n           0  1220883190         \nshogunhz@CyXs-MacBook-Pro ~ % diskutil verifyDisk disk4\nUnable to verify this whole disk: A GUID Partition Table (GPT) partitioning scheme is required (-69773)\nshogunhz@CyXs-MacBook-Pro ~ % sudo dd if=/dev/disk2 count=1 bs=512 | hexdump -Cv \nPassword:\n1+0 records in\n1+0 records out\n512 bytes transferred in 0.020153 secs (25406 bytes/sec)\n00000000  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  |................|\n00000010  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  |................|\n00000020  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  |................|\n00000030  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  |................|\n00000040  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  |................|\n00000050  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  |................|\n00000060  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  |................|\n00000070  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  |................|\n00000080  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  |................|\n00000090  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  |................|\n000000a0  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  |................|\n000000b0  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  |................|\n000000c0  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  |................|\n000000d0  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  |................|\n000000e0  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  |................|\n000000f0  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  |................|\n00000100  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  |................|\n00000110  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  |................|\n00000120  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  |................|\n00000130  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  |................|\n00000140  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  |................|\n00000150  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  |................|\n00000160  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  |................|\n00000170  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  |................|\n00000180  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  |................|\n00000190  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  |................|\n000001a0  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  |................|\n000001b0  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 fe  |................|\n000001c0  ff ff ee fe ff ff 01 00  00 00 fe ff ff ff 00 00  |................|\n000001d0  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  |................|\n000001e0  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  |................|\n000001f0  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  00 00 00 00 00 00 55 aa  |..............U.|\n00000200\nshogunhz@CyXs-MacBook-Pro ~ % sudo gpt -r show /dev/disk4\n       start        size  index  contents\n           0  1220883190         \n\n\nA: I suspect this is not because of any issue with the specified disk but because verifyDisk will not work on synthesized disks.

However, after upgrading to Ventura, a new \"realpath\" was added to /bin and, unfortunately, it doesn't support the option my build system uses (--s). Is it possible to change the order of how utilities are found in the path or to change /bin/realpath to point to the one that works? I looked into disabling the SIP, but that seemed a bit heavy handed.\n\nA: You can't change anything in /bin. Apple now provides the system on a sealed volume.\nThe correct solution is to fix the build files so that they do not use an non usual argument.\nHowever you can use the $PATH environment variable to find a GNU realpath by installing that program and having its directory on the PATH before Apple's directories.\nThe easiest way is use a package manager like MacPorts or HomeBrew.\nAlthough read this SuperUser answer to see that there might not be a common way to fix this as the command line realpath is not standardized at all\n", "Q: MacBook Air M1 battery completely drained after not using it for a few months I powered off my M1 MacBook Air a few (~3) months ago and I was surprised to find out that it had drained completely when I tried to power it on today. Why did this happen?\nIf I recall correctly the battery level was around 50% when I kept it in storage, so what caused the complete drain?\nWill it harm the battery life? How should I store my MacBook without using it for a prolonged period of time and not harm the battery?\n\nA: I'm at a loss to explain why it didn't hold its charge if it was actually shut-down (off), rather than just sleeping. Always make sure that it has finished shutting down before closing the lid. Perhaps it turned itself on (Wake on LAN..? Scheduled startup?)\nApple's own documentation does say that storing a battery at 0% can put it into a 'deep discharge state', rendering it unusable. If that hasn't happened, you should be alright.\nA one-off incident is unlikely to have much bearing on the overall life of the battery: as with our own health, it's the repeated, long-term behaviour that matters.\nhttps://www.apple.com/uk/batteries/maximizing-performance/\nApple does recommend storing at 50%, so you've done everything right.\n", "Q: Compact Nested Single Folders for Finder VSCode has a Compact Folders feature in its file explorer that renders nested single child folders as one line. If there's a folder whose only child is another folder, they appear as one element.

I verified both monitors (LG GN950) support 4K 144 and the cables support DisplayPort 1.4 DSC by connecting to my gaming PC w/ a 3080RTX.\nLastly I ordered Thunderbolt 3->DisplayPort cables to check if it's just the adapter that doesn't work. However, input from anyone with experience would be much appreciated.\nOne more thing: Macs and 4K 120 Hz displays compatibility list\nSomeone shared that they have an M1 Ultra w/ 2x 4K displays at 144 Hz, but no detailed config information\n Mac Studio (M1 Ultra, 2022)\n 2 × Gigabyte M32U (4K @ 144 Hz)\n\nA: So the adapter does not work, and it makes sense as I believe the bandwidth for dual 4K displays at 144 Hz exceeds that of TB4. I simply ordered the USB-C -> DisplayPort adapters and everything works as expected.\n\n", "Q: Formatting a large SD card is taking time. What happens if I pause it? A few days ago, I formatted an SD card with Mac OS Ventura to make it bootable. Then, I wanted to reverse this process and use the SD card for transferring files again. So, I followed the instructions here:\nhttps://apple.stackexchange.com/a/280650/456222\nNow, this SD card is 512GB. The process is taking a long time, projected to take 1-2 days. What happens if I prematurely cancel it? Is there a way to pause and resume the process?\n\nA: The dd command you copied from the linked answer fills the whole disk with random bytes, depending on the size of the disk this will take ages.\nThe command most likely is not needed in your case (it's actually not needed to solve the problem in the question it attempts to answer either), so you can just press Ctrl-C to stop it, start Disk Utility, select the disk and erase/partition it as needed.\nPS: Finder may complain about the disk being unreadable after you stopped dd. This is to be expected and nothing to worry about.\n", "Q: 2009 iMac Display has thin transparent vertical lines I recently got a 2009 27 inch iMac. I noticed the display has weird thin transparent vertical lines shown in the photo below.\nThe lines don't obstruct anything, and are less visible the farther you are away, but they are annoying. The light and dark spots seem to me moving upward. There are about eight of these groups of 4/5 lines throughout the display about 1-2 inches apart with varying visibility. They are more visible on darker but not completely black backgrounds.\nI plugged the iMac into an external display, and the lines were not there. Also, when I changed the screen resolution, the lines were in the same places. This makes me think it is not a gpu issue. While the computer was open, I pushed and pulled on some of the display wires and nothing happened. I also ran the mac with high cpu usage so it would get hot to see if anything would change, and it didn't.\nWhen I opened it up, it appeared the locations of the lines corresponded with the ribbon cables that were going on the display\nI found some other posts where people had the exact same issue (lines appearing in the same places), but they never solved the problem other than replacing the entire display.\nWhat would cause this, and is it possible to fix without new parts? If it is the display failing, what specific part of it is? I might be able to get access to some pcb boards on a scrap iMac display to replace with.\n\nClick for full size\n\nA: Due to this occurring within the monitor itself. It is most likely a hardware issue, I think bringing it in somewhere and getting the display itself looked at is your best bet unfortunately.\n", "Q: Applescript to bring a Terminal window to front I have a shell script which runs a long-running processes in a Terminal window.\nI leave it running and work on other Terminal windows.\nI'd like to be notified when the shell script finishes, by bringing its window\nto front.\nI have following code, which I wanted to run at the end of the shell script:\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    tell process \"Terminal\"\n        try\n            set win to (!code to get current window!)\n            perform action \"AXRaise\" of win\n        end try\n    end tell\n  end tell\n\nbut I don't know how to get current window.\n\nA: tell application \"Terminal\"\n    activate\n    set hw to windows whose contents contains \"new-glasses\"\n    --> {window id 67 of application \"Terminal\"}\n    \n    set hw1 to item 1 of hw\n    --> window id 67 of application \"Terminal\"\n    \n    set index of hw1 to 1\nend tell\n\nThe above script presumes that only one window will contain the specified string and that it has but one tab. The first line gets a list with a single item — the matching window. The second line gets that specific window. The third line sets its index to 1 (i.e. makes it the front window). Dunno if it makes a difference but I'm running this on Sierra.\n", "Q: What might be causing horizontal lines on an early 2006 iMac? I picked up an early iMac, Early 2006 \"Core Duo\" 2.0 (4,1) - MA199 (aka A1173) - and it has horizontal lines on the screen:\n\nThe seller showed pictures of the screen before shipping it to me and there were no lines. When I received the iMac, I can tell from how it was packed it would have received a lot of hard hits as it was not well padded and the box was very banged up.\nThe lines are varying in that sometimes there's a lot of them and sometimes there's just a few. I suspect this is a hardware issue (video adapter going bad, bad VRAM, etc.) but before I conclude that, I'm wondering if there are any steps I can take to rule any other causes out?\n\nA: If the lines are not consistant, then it is unlikely to be an LED screen issue. This is because any \"loose\", or poor, connections, due to partial delamination, tend to be consistant, and not vary.\nHowever, it might be possible to verify whether it is an LED screen issue, or not, by applying a little (local) pressure the border of the LED screen1, at either end of the line. If (when you press) the line goes, then there is likely to be a suspect contact.\nAs a side note: this isn't a foolproof method as no amount of pressure would temporarily fix a corroded contact. Nevertheless, a corroded contact would result in consistant lines across the screen and not change their location nor number\nIf the line is not due to a loose connection at the edge of the screen, then possible GPU issues are likely, and a reballing, or reflow, may be required... Or even a mild reheating with a heat gun applied to the GPU, once the heatsink has been removed, could fix the issue.\nIf performing the latter, then construct a heat mask out of heavy duty silver foil with a hole cut just for the GPU, in order to protect the other nearby components from the ravages of the heat gun.\n\nFootnote\n1 In order to access the edges of the LCD panel, you need to remove the front panel first:\n\n*\n\n*Remove the RAM door (two Philips screws)\n\n*Remove four Torx screws from the base of the front panel\n\n*Slide a credit card in to both sides of the slot at the rear, to release the two latches holding the top of the front of the panel\n\n*Gently loosen the front panel all of the way around but do not pull it away fully.\n\n*Disconnect the camera and microphone cables at the top center\n\n*Now, you can lever off the front panel\n\nSee the first three minutes of How to Replace a Hard Drive in a 2006/2007 White iMac for a clear demonstration of how to remove the front panel.\n", "Q: Why can't I use Automator to correctly target UI elements in System Preferences? [ventura] I'm trying to use Automator to record an action on the system preferences, in the accessibility display pane.  I want to change the value of the slider for the color filter intensity.\nI use automator to Watch Me Do and record the action.  I reset the preferences manually. Clicking run does not cause the setting to change in preferences.\nSo I drag the actions from the Watch Me Do panel to the workflow timeline, which pop-out the action into an AppleScript.  Running this is also not successful.\nCan I manually set this preference in some way via the cli?  When I search Apple developer docs, all I'm finding is Swift code to write an application.  ((I realize that the app that will do this change, Automator, Terminal, or otherwise, will need to be granted accessibility permissions under privacy/security system preferences.))\nOr how do I get/write an AppleScript to do this?\n\n\nAlso, I have checked the OSAX dictionary for System Preferences, and it does not have more specific controls registered besides at the basic window/pane/etc level\n\n\nI tried running the terminal command as defaults write com.apple.mediaaccessibility MADisplayFilterSingleColorIntensity -float 0.25 but this did not change the Intensity slider, including when before/after toggling the Accessibility Colors Filters on/off.\n\n\nA: You can set it via Terminal by running\ndefaults write com.apple.mediaaccessibility MADisplayFilterBlueColorCorrectionIntensity -float 0.25\nYou can set the values for each filter independently by replacing MADisplayFilterBlueColorCorrectionIntensity with the one you want:\nRed/Green: MADisplayFilterRedColorCorrectionIntensity\nGreen/Red: MADisplayFilterGreenColorCorrectionIntensity\nBlue/Yellow: MADisplayFilterBlueColorCorrectionIntensity\nColor Tint: MADisplayFilterSingleColorIntensity\nThe lowest value is 0.25 and the highest is 1.0.\n", "Q: 8TB external hard drive filling up after only 3 TB used, 5TB reported as \"inaccessible\" I've got an 8 TB expansion drive.

However, files located on certain directories in my \"iCloud Drive\" (notably in the directories \"Downloads\" and \"Pages\") show only the name without extension. The directories in iCloud Drive, which I created manually always show the extension on the file.\nOf course I can right-click an individual file, select \"Get Info\", and then uncheck the \"hide extension\" checkbox, but I would have Finder to always show the extension. Is there a way to \"unhide extension\" for a whole directory?\nUPDATE: Basically I always want to see the extension of the files in Finder. It would be great if there were a feature which would forbid applications to change this setting for certain directories.\n\nA: You can force Finder to show all Filename extensions by enabling the setting in Finder > Settings > Advanced:\nNote: Versions prior to Ventura 13.0 will call this \"Preferences\" instead of \"Settings\" but the option is the same.\n\n", "Q: How can a mac admin access my laptop by files while I’m offline? I have a company laptop and my Mac admin was able to update my application apps, remove unnecessary apps, and clear old files in my document folder. However, he was able to do all of this while my mac was offline.\nOnly way I can think the admin would be able to do this is if he had some kind of back up system in place before my mac went offline? I didn’t  notice any cloud or syncing service on my Mac.\n\nA: If you are completely offline even during boot (being certain that your bios isn't connecting to internet during boot), then your mac is probably using some version of an online filesystem (NFS) that stores all of its files in the cloud. However, the more probable answer, is that your admin is using MDM, and during a mac os boot, your bios connected to wifi, and the MDM controller automatically modified your files on boot.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro cannot extend displays I am using a 2019 13-inch MacBook Pro (2 Thunderbolt ports) with a dual monitor setup. I typically close my MacBook lid so the 2 monitors are my main monitors. However, with the lid closed. My MacBook only sees 1 monitor; both monitors show the exact same screen (so they mirror).\nI've read online that typically this is caused by your dock. But I have no clue which dock to use if that's the case since my current dock: Club-3D USB Type C 3.2 Gen1 Triple Display Dynamic PD Charging Dock.\nIt works fine with a Windows laptop, connecting both screens and extending them.\nI'm hoping since the exact same setup does work on Windows that there's a software fix.\nIf not, I'm curious to find out which dock to use that does also supports Mac.\n\nA: The specifications here state that this dock is an MST device.

I tried to remove the custom domain yesterday to reset an issue I'm having. The iCloud website warned me that all emails would be deleted but i'm struggling to see how that could happen given they are downloaded to my mac and also sitting in folders in the cloud.\nWould they literally look for anything with my custom domain and delete it from my mail storage? Seems odd if they did.\nBTW the problem is a calendar issue where I'm not receiving invites into one specific custom domain set up in 2021, but my newer domains are absolutely fine.\n\nA: I can only guess at this, but are you really sure you want to actually delete this domain?\nA mail domain needs a set of 'internet accessible' records, CNAME & MX records in order for your account to be found. Think of this as like a DNS pointer to a web site.\nIf you discard the domain, these records will be removed from the 'internet database' & will no longer exist. I doubt this will mean Apple will actively chase down any emails you have already archived locally - that would be unfeasible - but what will happen is that all ties between your existing mailbox & you will be destroyed. You won't be able to access these again later.\nIt would be sensible for any organisation running a structure for multiple independent users that after destroying an account to tidy up afterwards, not just removing the connections to it but deleting its contents too. There is the remote possibility they could archive this temporarily, but may not choose to; meaning this decision would be final.\nI don't have great experience in this, though I have moved my own mail servers recently & this is the effective result - after the deletion of the old account [part of a handover in my own case] the old account is simply 'gone', inaccessible.\nIf Apple say the mail database will be deleted, believe them.\n", "Q: Why not display the resolution value？ this is my settings menu:\n\nand this is others settings menu:\n\nwe are both Ventura:\n\n\nWhat's happened?\n\nA: The first version is because the Mac has recognised a Retina display is connected.\nThe second is either not Retina, or is not registering correctly.\nGoogle turns up very few hits for the PH27AQ2, but it would appear to be a 2k screen, 27\" 2560 x 1440.

At first the wheel freezes and a spinning beach ball appears for a few seconds before disappearing again, whilst the other wheel continues. Then it stays like that. At most I had the computer on for weeks (forgot to turn it off after I tried something) and when it woke, it still spun.\nComputer info:\nMid 2011 iMac with High Sierra 10.13.6, 16gb RAM, 1tb HDD\nBackground:\nI moved six months ago and when I plugged the computer back in something was off. First it was really slow and then it started acting up, only showing questionmarks in the status bar. In the same time I added another account for my girlfriend (I'm pretty confident the problem had started before that but I'm not entirely sure) and before long the problem was as is still. Note: when moving I had it packed down in the original box so it should've been safe, and I carried it from one apartment to another (just 30 meters or so) so I don't see how it could've been damaged from that.\nWhat I'm able to do:\nAs far as I can see my girlfriends account works without any problems\nMy research so far:\nSo having googled this for six months now I've A) found people with similar problems (though no (working) solutions), and B) ran out of keywords. Lots of people which describe a similar problem seemed to have it caused by either faulty startup objects or faulty hardware. Since I can't log in, not even in safe mode, I can't disable the startup objects (I tried to log in whilst pressing down the shift-key but that didn't work) and a hardware/hard drive analysis says everything's fine.\nWhat I've tried:\n\n*\n\n*Hardware check which came up empty, saying everything was alright\n\n*HDD scan which came up empty\n\n*Resetting PRAM/NVRAM and SMC\n\n*Safe mode which managed to get me inside at first but then froze. Now I can't even log in this way.\n\n*Login without start objects (login in whilst pressing shift-key)\n\n*Reinstalling the OS (twice) which did nothing (actually it was after that safe mode stopped working (not that it was really working before))\n\n*Disconnected all peripherals/tried with another mouse+keyboard (for no reason at all really)\n\n*Talked with the apple support which amazingly not only gave support for a soon to be 12-year old, but did so for quite some time. They suggested reinstalling the OS, which as mentioned did not work\n\n*Update: changing the password didn't work\n\nWhat to do next:\nYes, exactly, what do I do next? Any other possible solutions? Can I reach my files through the other account somehow (the support told me no but surely there must be a way with another admin account and the password?), perhaps through the terminal. or maybe turn off the startup objects from there? Install an earlier OS (mine is the latest for that model)?\nUpdate: This thread describes a very similar problem and points out icloud (at least by one person) as a potential instigator, something I had issues with (couldn't log in/out and it kept telling me to do so for about six months(!)). Anyway, the suggested solution(s) aren't possible in the way that they suggest and as I understand it it's not possible to change the UUID from High Sierra and onwards and it's not possible to log out/change the apple ID from outside an account?\nThanks!\n\nA: If UserB is an Administrator, then UserB can run an interactive shell as user UserA by entering the command below.\nsudo -i -u UserA\n\nIf prompted, enter the password for UserB.

I wanted to say to her \"Here, please take these, and use them it will be easier\".\nSimilarly I often want to \"take\" those from my document, and \"add them to\" another document I have before me.\nHow is it done?\n\nA: There is no mechanism to export paragraph styles to another document in Pages.\nPerhaps the most convenient way is to duplicate an existing document with the styles and shortcuts you wish to communicate, empty the duplicate, and send the empty document to your colleague so that she can fill it out as she needs.\nIf you are using the same styles and shortcuts in many of your Pages documents and creating new documents frequently, you might want to look into using templates if you are not already doing so. See the \"Create and use page templates in Pages on Mac\n\" Apple support webpage for details.\nYou can also copy a style and paste it to another document using the keyboard shortcuts Command ⌘+Option ⌥+C and Command ⌘+Option ⌥+V, respectively, but that would only modify an existing style in the other document rather than creating a new one.\n", "Q: Security running DOSBox on MacOS? General security question. Are there security concerns running DOSBox natively on MacOS? I'm not sure if Apps are run inside some user jail that prevents the app from modifying user data outside the application or other MacOS files.\nI've been running DOSBox inside a VirtualBox Debian VM, basically because I have slightly higher trust in VirtualBox packaging than DOSBox. Unfortunately, sound and mouse movement is choppy, which makes me consider running DOSBox natively on MacOS. I think about Keychain access to my accounts and if DOSBox presents a security concern. Note, I run few few open source products on MacOS natively, mostly inside Linux VM instances for this reason.\n\nA: Any application you install and run can do anything you have the rights to (with some limits like camera access, full disk access etc which need to be specifically granted to applications). But this is valid for DOSbox as much as for VirtualBox, so the risk is there anyway.\nOTOH DOSbox has been around for a while, so the chance of backdoors and hidden activities going unnoticed for so long is rather low. Unless you are a high profile target (where creating a version targeted specifically at you would have value for an attacker) I don‘t see a reason to worry.\nPS: As has been mentioned in the comments, DOSBox is rather old (the latest release is over 10 years old), so you might be better of with DOSBox-X which is still under active development.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro Erase All Contents and Settings Does performing Erase All Contents and Settings as they described here 3 times in a short period of time have any adverse effect on the Mac?\nSpecs: MacBook Pro, 2021, M1 Pro.\n\nA: Other than erasing and writing data to the drive and potentially losing your data if you haven’t backed it up, there is no adverse effect on your Mac.\n", "Q: Firefox start in last used space I use several spaces on my iMac. When i start an application it always open in the current space, except Firefox who will start in the last space it used. This is really annoying because I have to switch to the space Firefox decided to start in which almost never is the space i have selected.\nIs this a bug in Firefox, or is it a setting I have that causes this behavior?\nEdit: Settings in the Dock is not what cause this behavior:\n\nEdit 2: I tried to use the Dock setting \"This Desktop\" and the only difference is that when it is enabled, the selected Desktop/Space is switched into view. When i disable \"This Desktop\", Firefox still launches in the last used Desktop/Space, but the Desktop/Space is not switched into view.\nEdit 3: I reinstalled Firefox (dragged the app to trash, downloaded from Mozilla and installed) to no avail. I noticed that all settings and history was retained, so perhaps the problem is hidden in the stored data or settings that was not wiped. Will try to wipe all user data.\nThanks in advance,\nMike\n\nA: There is no preference setting for 'last Space used'.\nThere is 'All Desktops' [which makes the app follow you to all Spaces], This Desktop', [which is what I presume you have set] & 'None' [which has no affinity at all & should always start on the current Space].\nThese do not apply to fullscreen Spaces, only 'regular' Spaces.\nYou can access the setting by right clicking the app icon in the Dock, then Options…\n\nIf you are not on 'this desktop' when you access the option, it will show an additional item, showing the Space number.\n\nApple has always used the terms Desktop and Space interchangeably.\n\nA: I figured out what caused this problem. In Settings, tab \"General\", there is an option \"Open previous Windows and tabs\" that is causing the issue for me. If I uncheck this option, Firefox launch in the current Desktop/Space. If it is checked, it launches in whatever Desktop/Space that was last used and if \"Assign To | This Desktop\" in the Dock is not selected, the Desktop/Space that Firefox reside in will not be switched to, thus Firefox launch silently out of the users view.\nThis must be a bug.

I connect the Arturia to the laptop obviously with a USBC-USBC cable.\nThe Arturia is bus powered. It is \"USB-C interface compatible with PC and Mac, fully USB 2.0 compatible\". (You can get actual thunderbolt dacs but they are still $expensive.)\nYou simply set System Settings -> \"Sound\" output to the interface, see image, and, it works perfectly.\nHOWEVER on restart - the setting is lost and it reverts to one of the standards such as headphone out or laptop speakers.\nAlso as a curiosity: \"sound effects through ...\" is endlessly set to \"headphones\", even though, I would never use that (I'd just use \"laptop speakers\" if not using an audio interface).\nI did try removing everything here /Library/Preferences/Audio and restarting a few times, but no difference.\nThe Arturia (like most dacs) is completely plug and play.

I was thinking about how Asahi Linux is based off of Arch, and how SteamOS is also based off of Arch (at least the Steam Deck version), and thought maybe I could install the Asahi Linux UEFI environment then boot off of a Steam Deck recovery image. Before I try it, has anyone else tried it already? Would it work theoretically?\n\nA: No, currently, it is not possible to boot SteamOS on an M1 Mac.\nI neglected to read that Steam Deck is actually x86 and not ARM like I assumed. Furthermore, in Asahi’s alpha release blog post, the developers stated that vanilla ARM64 images aren’t quite enough, and more work is needed for compatibility.\nIt is somewhat possible that SteamOS may be bootable eventually, but that would likely require an ARM processor being on a future Valve device running SteamOS, so probably not anytime soon.\n", "Q: What does the insert key do in macOS?

I'm currently using macOS Ventura 13.1 on my i5 Macbook Pro 2020. After updating to this version, some unexpected behavior has arose, such as \"Steam\" added items that can run in the background. I was able to fix that issue by removing Steam related file from /User/user_name/Library/LaunchAgents.\nNow, I realized something interesting. I have ln on the “Allow in the Background” list. Although it says “item from unidentified developer”, the source directory is directly /bin/ln. If there's no such reverse engineering or similar, I believe it's most likely safe. It's literally the ln command to link files. After surfing a bit through other people's problems with the same page, I figured that I'm the only one with the ln listed.\nMy question is simple: Why do I see ln listed here meanwhile other people don't have it?\n\n\nA: It's related to Docker for macOS.

The Mac Startup Manager detects the existence of a BIOS booting operating system based on the values stored in the Master Boot Record (MBR) partition table and the GUID Partition Table (GPT). This allows you to install a BIOS booting Linux, BIOS booting Windows or any other BIOS booting operating system.\nTraditionally, the macOS operating system has looked at content of a volume in a partition flagged as BIOS bootable. If the correct files are found, then Windows will be presented as a possible the startup disk.

During these minutes the battery percentage won't shrink. The physical battery has a cycles count of ca. ten +/- so it's definitely not a battery problem.\n\nIf it dies while on battery power only after a few minutes, the battery is at fault.

To achieve this I use pmset repeat wake M 12:58:55 to wake up my Mac 5 seconds before the job.\nThe first problem I encounter is that it is awakened (at the login screen) at 12:58:00 instead of 12:58:55. Since the login screen time before is goes to sleep again is 30 seconds, by 12:59:00 my Mac is already sleeping again, so my job never runs.\nIs there a way to start the job at the desired time and/or extend the time before my Mac goes back to sleep at the login screen? Currently is set to 30 seconds.\n\nA: Hardware Limitations\nThis is a hardware constraint. Scheduled wake up and power on times are not accurate to the second. Typically they happen within thirty seconds of the scheduled time.\nWith successive versions of macOS, Apple's engineers have become increasingly aggressive with the return to sleep period after scheduled wakes. If no user activity, or a power assertion, is detected, expect your Mac to return to sleep after ten to fifteen seconds.\nThere is currently no formal documentation from Apple about this behaviour; it has been discovered through experience.\nPerform on Wake\nIdeally, try to enqueue your task to perform when the Mac wakes from sleep.

However, third party apps cannot use the Neural Engine, leading to similar neural network performance to older iPhones.\n\nReading this Reddit hardly and hardly find the answer, I'd love to ask:\nWhat is the Neural Engine in new generation Mac architectures?\nI know there is CPU which is a component that receives commands (instructions) and works in front of a memory (RAM), and I know there is GPU who receives commands and works in front of another memory (matrix driven).\nIs NE also a similar component to them? If so, does it also have a unique instruction-set? Specific programming/logic/script languages? Equivalent competitors in the market/industry?\nIf as a computer man, I want to benefit from it, what apps can I develop with it for example, which is clearly better to do with it, than with GPU? I would love for specific details rather than general lines as Apple provides to the chip\n\nA: What is the Neural Engine?\nThe Neural Engine is a part of Apple's processors - for example the Apple Silicon M1 that you have tagged.\nThe M1 die has many parts that make up the processor. That includes a CPU, a GPU, the Neural Engine, caches, RAM and other smaller parts.\nEach of those parts again consists of smaller parts:\nThe CPU is actually a number of performance CPU cores and a number of efficiency cores. The GPU consists of a number of modules, which can be thought of as GPU cores. And the Neural Engine consist of a number of NPU cores (Neural Processing Units).\nIs the Neural Engine a similar component to the CPU and GPU?\nIn general terms, you can think of CPU cores, GPU cores and NPU cores as a sort of \"black box\" that takes in commands (instructions, or whatever you would like to call them), communicates with the rest of the processor and peripherals (such as for example loading/storing data in RAM or communicating over busses) and perform some sort of computation.\nThe Apple M1 is structured with a unified memory architecture which means that these various subsystems all access the same main memory. There is no special \"matrix driven memory\" for the GPU as you indicate in your question.\nThe Neural Engine is targeted specifically at performing the types of computation you would need when running machine learning models. Typically this means optimising for very fast matrix multiplications.\nDoes it have a unique instruction-set or programming languages?\nThe Neural Engine has a unique \"instruction set\" (although it is not part of the ARM instruction set). Similar to programs for the CPU and GPU, you have a compiler which transform programs (models) written in a higher level language into commands and data structures that can be understood by the Neural Engine.\nFrom a practical stand point, ordinary developers will interact with the Neural Engine through using CoreML. This means that they essentially a single, specific \"language\" for their models.\nCan the Neural Engine do something better than the CPU or GPU?\nThe Neural Engine is not strictly \"better\" than the CPU or the GPU for performing these sort of calculations. You can run machine learning models on the CPU, on the GPU and on the Neural Engine - so the Neural Engine is not opening up some new type of computation that is impossible without it.\nThe main reason for the Neural Engine compared to having extra CPU cores is that the Neural Engine is targeted specifically for a few, specific types of computations common in machine learning models. This means that it usually performs these computations using less electrical power than had you used a CPU core (or looked at alternatively, you achieve higher performance with the same amount of electrical power). In addition, it is possible for the CPU and GPU to be doing something else while the Neural Engine does its work. This means longer battery life, less fan noise, lower perceived latency, etc.\nAre the competitors in the market?\nThere exist many other neural processing units in the market. It is not something that is unique to Apple. For example Google have their TPU, Nvidia have the NVDLA, Amazon have Inferentia, and so on.\nHowever, Apple is perhaps in a unique situation where the overwhelming majority of their users of their operating systems (iOS, iPadOS and macOS) have their Neural Engine (in some version) and run compatible software. This means that they can aggressively take advantage of it in their applications and background services.\n", "Q: Why is \"Apple silicon\" with lowercase \"s\"?

The choose menu opens where I can select a password and it is succesfully copied to my clipboard.\nBut running the script from within the Shortcuts app doesn't work. The choose menu opens successfully, but after selecting a password, the script just runs infinitely without exiting.\nMy assumption is that it waits for a password input to decrypt the password file with GPG. When running the script manually, the Pinentry Mac UI opens to enter a password. Maybe this is broken from within the Shortcuts app.\n\nA: Graphical Requirement?\nDoes any dependency of your script require access to the Window Manager or graphical session to work? If so, is Shortcuts running your script in the current graphical session?\nThe following approaches try to force the script to run within the current graphical session.\nApplication Based\nTry creating a stand alone application that runs your shell script. Get this application working consistently, then use Shortcuts.app to launch the resulting application.\nIf needed, the application can be ad-hoc code signed. It can also be  tested in isolation from Shortcuts.\nTo create an application, use Automator.app or Script Editor.app to run the script, using do shell script, and Save as… an app.\nTerminal Based\nAlternatively, save your shell script as a text file with the extension .command and open this file using Shortcuts.

There is only one WiFi network that even works for me (i.e for which I have the password) at this residence.\nThere is a similar question here Facetime audio calls not working using iPhone   but the situation (and the answer) are different from mine. In my case the WiFi network has not been changed for years.\nSo what needs to be done to resolve this?\n\nA: There are several factors that can influence whether devices (in your case, an iPhone and a Mac) \"see\" each other on a Wi-Fi network.  This is required for Handoff like transferring a call from your iPhone to your Mac.\n\n*\n\n*Wi-Fi signal stability.  A poor signal means less bandwidth and higher latency.  If the discovery (broadcast and response) packets get dropped it's like you not answering the phone thus the \"I can't find you\" problem.\n\n*Wi-Fi client isolation.  This is a security feature of Wi-Fi network hardware like APs that prevent client devices from seeing each other.\n\n*An active VPN tunnel (from comments).  Typically, VPN tunnels will route all traffic (default route) of the client through the tunnel; some can split the tunnel and allow local traffic to stay on the local network (policy configuration).  If a VPN is active and is configured to be the default route, then the device is technically on a different network.  Therefore, the devices can't see each other.\n\n*Bandwidth limitations.  A VPN can consume much more bandwidth than you realize.  Remember there's the overhead of the headers (creates the tunnel) and the encrypted data.\n\nThe Problem in a Nutshell...\nBased on the comments, it sounds like you have multiple factors plaguing you:\n\n*\n\n*Weak Wi-Fi signal that reduces the available bandwidth\n\n*An active VPN connection that could\n\n*\n\n*Route all your traffic through the VPN\n\n*Consume most/all bandwidth resulting in severe latency.\n\n\n\nWhat to do...\nFirst, disable your VPN.  If Handoff starts working, you know your VPN is contributing to the problem.  If you can, take your Mac to place with good Wi-Fi signal strength and test out Handoff while the VPN is working.  If the problem goes away, it's a bandwidth issue.  If the problem persists while the VPN is active, it's a traffic routing issue.\n", "Q: Can I create a desktop shortcut to a website without going through the browser?

I recently dusted off a 2018 MBP because I needed an Intel processor (my current Mac is an M1), and it seems the Wi-Fi no longer works.\nThat is, the system recognizes there’s a Wi-Fi radio, but it can’t see any available networks. Ethernet via dongle works fine. Hardware diagnostic turns up nothing.\nI suppose it’s possible the antenna got disconnected. I’ve never dropped it (I suppose someone else might have, but there are no dings or other evidence of a drop).\nBefore I open it up to check the antenna cables, does anyone have any other advice for figuring this out?\nUpdate\nAs luck would have it, it was a loose antenna connector. All three of them, in fact, which is troubling. They popped on without much force, making me worry they’ll pop off again in the future. I added a bit of Kapton tape to hopefully help prevent that:\n\n\nPut it all back together, and it seems to be working!\n\nA: Boot into Startup Manager by holding down Option. You'll see a list of boot devices, and also a dropdown selector for WiFi networks. If you don't see anything in that, then either something is wrong with the interface or antenna, or there are no WiFi networks. You could also try shifting the laptop screen to a more extreme angle, as the antenna usually runs alongside the screen. I've seen cases on MacBooks where the WiFi would drop out when the screen was at a normal viewing angle, but was restored when adjusted.\n", "Q: What backup solution is thorough enough to include low level stuff like homebrew? Is Time Machine thorough enough? I need to migrate to a newer MacBook soon, because my current one is falling apart. But I have a lot of lower level stuff installed / configured such as Homebrew formulae and casks.\nI also have configured defaults in Terminal like defaults write com.apple.finder CreateDesktop false. I've also deleted my normal Downloads folder and replaced it with a symlink to a Downloads folder on my iCloud drive. And I'm using mackup to replace most of my apps' configuration files with symlinks to my iCloud drive as well.\nSo you know, a bunch of low level stuff and uncommon customizations. Will Apple's default tools be thorough enough to include those as well? Like Migration Assistant or Time Machine?\nIf not, what are they likely to miss? I don't mind having to redo some things manually, I'm just worried that I won't know exactly what Migration Assistant (for example) missed and that a few months later I'll be scratching my head about why something isn't working the way I was expecting.\nIf there's another tool that you'd recommend then I'm very interested.\n\nA: Stick with Time Machine...\n\nI need to migrate to a newer MacBook soon, because my current one is falling apart.\n\nYou never mentioned what vintage your Mac you currently have is nor which Mac you'll upgrade to.  However, it's not all that important as this is where Time Machine shines;  especially in this transitional era going from Intel processors to Apple silicon.  Time Machine backs up files and settings; the most important aspects of your system.\nI don't recommend making a clone of a drive especially in situations like yours since you will be going from one machine to a completely different one (even if they are in the same model family like MacBook Pro).  There is the potential to have a complete image of a drive with a macOS version incompatible with the new hardware - going from an i5 to an M1, for example.  When moving from one Mac to another, use Migration Assistant; it can use Time Machine as a migration source.\nInstead, use cloning for disaster recovery like going from similar vintage Mac computers or when you need to do a complete restore because your last experiment on the boot sector failed spectacularly.\nHow to see what Time Machine Backs Up....\nTime Machine backs up both your system drive, the data drive (where you can write), and even the Recovery partition.  To see what is backed up, simply browse the mounted TM volume and look for the .../Latest/ folder.  You can obtain it with the tmutil command:\n% tmutil latestbackup\n\n/Volumes/My Time Machine Drive/Backups.backupdb/my-mac/Latest\n\nListing that directory's contents reveals...\n% ls /Volumes/My Time Machine Drive/Backups.backupdb/my-mac/Latest\n\ndrwxr-xr-x@ 14 root  admin   476B Jun 26  2021 Macintosh HD\ndrwxr-xr-x@ 16 root  wheel   544B Jun 26  2021 Macintosh HD - Data\ndrwxr-xr-x@  4 root  wheel   136B Jun 26  2021 Recovery\n\nAbove is just a sampling.  Traverse the folders to see what's included with the current TM backup.\nThe Low Level Stuff...\n\nSo you know, a bunch of low level stuff and uncommon customizations. Will Apple's default tools be thorough enough to include those as well?\n\nThe most accurate answer is it depends.. If a file like a .plist for example is included in what is backed up, then yes, it will.  If it's a system file, it's also likely to get overwritten when you get the new OS. It's also possible that the particular setting you wrote is deprecated and whatever you backed up will not be applied even though the file was restored.\nKeep an Inventory of Your Customizations...\nI make extensive changes to my system.  I don't use Homebrew and instead opt for MacPorts - but the concept is the same.\n\n*\n\n*Make copies of critical files you edit.  For instance I have a folder that I ensure gets backed up of my .bash_profile or .zprofile as well as my ssh-keys and config files.\n\n\n*Get an inventory of your installed applications in Homebrew or in MacPorts\n\n\n*As you make tweaks to your system (i.e. defaults write com.apple.finder CreateDesktop false) you will know what it is and what you did.  The best part is you can script it in a Bash/Zsh script for the next time you do a fresh install.  Here's a sample snippit:\n...\necho \"Writing my Finder Desktop Tweaks...\"\ndefaults write com.apple.finder CreateDesktop false\nsleep 1    # 1 second pause to allow you to read the output\necho \"Writing my next tweak....\"\ndefaults write com.apple.turbo.hamster.enable true\n...\n\nYou could easily run that script to make your changes on a new system.  The advantage this has is that you have in essence a \"paper trail\" of what you did so you can replicate it or trace down an error/failure.\n\n\n*Advanced.  I make copies of my /etc/ssh directory including the system identity files so if I am reinstalling and OS, I can overwrite the system defaults so that all of my devices don't have to \"remember\" the security keys when authenticating via SSH.\nWhat Should You Buy?\nNothing, unless you absolutely need it.\nWhy?\nBackup/Recovery is more of a process and strategy than a product you purchase.  Everything you really need is already included with your Mac.  With a little diligence, you can know and install everything you added with Homebrew.\nBesides, I highly recommend re-installing your Homebrew formulae because what you compiled on your older Core i3/i5/i7 (dare I say Core2Duo) and the new M1/M2 you just acquired is likely to be incompatible.  You'll need to recompile it for the new processor.  This is where having that inventory will come in handy.  Plus, you have the added benefit of auditing what you've installed - you might find that Nyancat you installed as a goof really isn't needed anymore.\n\nA: If you're unsure about all the customisations you've made and want to preserve as much as possible, I would use SuperDuper to clone the drive to the new MacBook (via starting the new MacBook in Target Mode or using a USB Disk), then do an in-place upgrade of the operating system in the usual way. Time Machine will probably do the job as well, but SuperDuper ensures a block-perfect copy of the relevant partitions.\nOf course you'll still need to check your customisations are actually compatible with the new version of macOS, but this will give the best chance of preserving as much as possible. If you're really keen to avoid this in the future, you could also write a catalog of your customisations into an automated deployment tool such as MDS as scripts or packages, so you could replicate your environment onto a fresh OS install at the click of a button. That's the \"hardcore\" option though!\n", "Q: Warnings on SSH processes It's been a while since I've needed to connect to a server via SSH. When I tried to connect today, Little Snitch gave me this warning:\n\nThe program \"ssh\" has been modified\nPreviously, the program had the identifier \"com.apple.openssh\", but\nnow it's \"com.apple.ssh\". This probably means that Apple decided to\nrename the process. But please inspect the names! If a process has\nbeen replaced with a script interpreter such as Python, its rules may\nbe hijacked by a script virus.\n\n\nAnd this is probably nothing, but looking at the binary in a code editor, I noticed the first 8 characters say \"cafe babe\".

In order to be able to save my work and try to reboot it, I activated the \"Mouse Keys\" feature https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/control-the-pointer-using-mouse-keys-mh27469/mac that allows to simulate the mouse-click with the \"i\" keyboard key.\nAfter rebooting the macbook however, I cannot login anymore.

But pressing enter says it´s the wrong password. Capslock isn´t activated and the password is a simple lowercase word without any special characters, so I´m absolutely sure it´s entered correctly.\nI tried pressing alt+cmd+F5 as the article about \"Mouse Keys\" mentions this combination to activate and deactivate the feature, but pressing it doesn´t seem to have an effect.\nWhat could be the problem here and how do I get back into the macbook?\n\nA: Have you tried booting into recovery mode?

I have additional displays connected if it matters.\nSay you grab the top of any window of any app, so as to move the window.\nIn many cases the overall window becomes, that is to say zooms down in size, to a \"large icon\" of the window (say, a couple inches square) which you then move.

It would seem the only solution is to \"avoid the red area\", which is basically impossible for anyone with decades of finger memory using computers.\nAs I mention the particularly frustrating thing is as well as \"making the mini window\" it appears to be simply broken, it often just \"doesn't move anywhere\" when you grab that \"mini title\".

I decided that I want to sign up for iTunes Match.  But I'm not sure how I can, or even if I can.\nI visited the \"Subscribe to iTunes Match\" page on the Apple Support site  and it says, \"To subscribe to iTunes Match, update your Mac to the latest version of macOS.\"\nWell, in our household there are 5 Macs.  The newest one is from 2016.  So none of these machines will run the latest version of macOS, which right now is macOS Ventura.\nSo my questions are:\n\n*\n\n*Is it actually true that one cannot sign up for iTunes Match on any Mac running anything earlier than macOS 13?  That seems pretty extreme to me.\n\n*Suppose I borrow (or even buy) a new Mac that will run macOS 13, and then use that to sign up for iTunes Match by following the instructions on the support page.  Will I then be able to use iTunes Match or any of its features on any of my other, older Macs?  (The Apple support page isn't clear on what version of macOS is required to actually use iTunes Match.)  Certainly, some of my older machines run older versions of iTunes and those seem to be aware that iTunes Match is a thing.  But if I signed up on a newer machine, would those older machines with older iTunes versions actually work fine (or at all) with iTunes Match?\n\nIn short, I am suspicious of Apple's stated requirements to sign up for iTunes Match, and I am unable to find any stated requirements for using iTunes Match.\nIf anyone can provide some definitive answers on this, that would be awesome.

Once I plug it, I can turn it on normally and continue using it with the battery for some more hours (or until it happens again). The capacity of the battery is still quite good, actually.\nReading other similar questions, I think that the battery might be unable to sustain peak power and I will need to replace it. It would make sense because it usually happens when I hear the CPU fans running or I open many different apps in a short period of time. But, as I have seen that there are many possible causes for this issue (and the capacity is still good) I would like to confirm that this is the cause and not something else.

Suppose I have a folder /my/dir/ and an alias in ~/Documents (called thisdir) pointing to /my/dir/. How can I find the alias (ie. find all aliases) that points to /my/dir/?\nThis question is unlike a seemingly similar question on Ask Different, which asks for how to find where an alias points to (even with deleted files). To the careful reader, this questions however asks for the reverse:\n/my/dir/ points to ~/Documents/thisdir, ie. the dir/ in /my/dir/ is an alias pointing to ~/Documents/thisdir.\nI want to know how I can find out what points to thisdir, if I don't know /my/dir/.\n\nA: Add Search Criteria to Spotlight Search\nWhen you run a Spotlight search using metadata attributes.  In your case, use the following search: kind:Alias\n\nFinder will find all Aliases on your system.  If you select Show all in Finder..., it will open a new Finder window with all of the Aliases in one place.  Simply select an Alias and press ⌘ CommandI or right click your mouse and select Get Info\nThat screen will show the metadata attributes of the file.  Look for Original which will indicate the original target (where it points to) of the Alias.\n\nUse Terminal to get a list of aliases\nUse the mdfind command to search for aliases in your system.  A simple search would be:\nmdfind \"kMDItemKind == 'Alias'\"\n\nThis will pull up all Aliases on your system.  Refer to the mdfind man page (man mdfind) for more specifics on searching syntax.\nYou can get the file's attributes using the mdls command (man mdls):\nmdls \"Clone Wars\"\n\nThis will display a complete list of all the metadata associated with that file including the item type.  Unfortunately, you can't get the target because that is stored as binary data and must be retrieved through Finder.\nFor a full list of searchable metadata types, see Narrow your search results on Mac (I keep it bookmarked for quick reference)\n", "Q: How exactly could these commands to use MacBook in Clamshell Mode without a Power Adapter be dangerous? And how to revert them eventually? I am trying use my macbook with an external device in Clamshell Mode without the power adapter. Hence, I am following this tutorial.\nThe author gives, first, a GUI approach. Then, he suggests the following commands on terminal:\npmset -g | grep hibernatemode\n\nsudo pmset -a sleep 0\nsudo pmset -a hibernatemode 0\nsudo pmset -a disablesleep 1\n\nsudo pmset -a sleep 1\nsudo pmset -a hibernatemode <original hibernatemode value | usually 3 on a MacBook>\nsudo pmset -a disablesleep 0\n\nThe point that intrigues me the most is that before giving the instructions, he says:\n\nNote: I have not tested these commands because Apple recommends not changing the hibernatemode using the pmset command, and these commands do just that. However, these commands will disable your laptop’s sleep on lid-close trigger, so they should also solve the problem of being unable to use your laptop in clamshell mode without the power adapter. That said, use them at your own risk.\n\nHence, my doubts are:\n\n*\n\n*Why does Apple not recommend tweaking hibernate-mode with the pmset command?\n\n\n*What could go wrong? Why is it dangerous?\n\n\n*If something bad happens, is it possible to revert the problem? And how to do it?\n\nA: \nWhy does Apple not recommend tweaking hibernate-mode with the pmset command?\n\nApple has performed painstaking tests and engineering to optimize the balance between availability of your device and protecting your data.  This has nothing to do with the health of your battery as the SMC and the battery itself will already take care of that aspect.\n\nWhat could go wrong? Why is it dangerous?\n\nModifying the hibernation of your Mac changes when and/or if it writes the data from RAM to a sleep image. If the machine powers off prior to it writing the image of your machine state, that image doesn’t get written to disk.  The danger is you’re now in data loss  territory.\n\nIf something bad happens, is it possible to revert the problem? And how to do it?\n\n“Revert?”  Not likely.  A sleep image that isn’t written isn’t a deleted file. It is data stored in volatile storage disappearing into thin air because it wasn’t saved. When it goes, it’s gone.\nNow, if you’ve saved your data to permanent storage, then you you can revert. But, that’s incumbent upon you to manage it.\nHow do you prevent this?\nUse your Mac as intended.  There is a reason for using a power adapter in closed clamshell mode.  Sure, you can circumvent it but then any failures and/or data loss is on you.\n\nA: Firstly: if your Mac laptop is permanently connected to a power source, it will go into \"Optimized Charging mode\" (after a few days), where it will only charge to 80%, in order to prevent any deterioration caused by being fully charged for long periods of time.\n\nSo the premise of the article -- that this procedure needs to be done to stop your battery being \"destroyed\" -- is false.\nAn external display makes different energy demands on your laptop, which the laptop can't manage in the same way as for the built-in screen.\nThe likely 'bad' thing that will happen is that your battery will fully discharge, because it no longer sleeps when you close the lid. Letting the battery fully discharge is just as bad, if not worse, than leaving it plugged in.\nApple's engineers spend a lot of time working on the design of the hardware and software, to maximise battery efficiency and lifespan. Rather than \"Apple knows what we want better than we do\", it's a case of \"Apple knows how their products are designed to work\".\n", "Q: Can't use external display while MacBook is closed without charging I'm using MacBook Air with one of the Type-C port connected to a hub (connected to monitor and keyboard), another one connected to charger, when I want to connect with an hard disk (Type-C), I unplug the charger.\nHowever the external monitor didn't work once I unplug the charger.  Is there any solution to solve this issue?\n\nA: That's how clamshell mode is supposed to work.  If you want to do this, you need to use an external hub that provides for charging.\n\nA: Don’t connect your monitor through the hub.  Go from one of the two Thunderbolt Type-C ports to your monitor.  This way, any changes made to the hub will have no effect on the monitor. I also advise you to get a USB-C hub with charging support (pass through) to better serve your needs.\nWhile in closed clamshell mode, you must maintain power.  This is by design: Why is it required to have your MacBook Pro plugged-in in closed-clamshell mode with an external display attached?\nI am assuming you have either a 2020 Intel or M1 MacBook Air as it was the only models with Type-C ports.\n", "Q: Is it possible to use a Macbook Air M1 with a resolution of 2560x1080/60Hz? If not, what are feasible adaptations? Recently, I bought a new monitor to use as an external display. I even asked a question about the compatibility on this forum.\nNow, I am trying to configure things. Unfortunately, the experience has been a bit annoying so far. Part of the problem seems to be this message from the monitor system:\n\nAs text to help further research:\n\nThe screen is not currently set to the recommended resolution. Configure the PC resolution to 2560x1080/60Hz. (The 2560x1080/60HZ resolution may not be supported on some PCs.)\n\n\nCurrent resolution: 1920x1080/60Hz\n\n\nRecommended resolution 2560x1080/60Hz\n\nIt is especially frustrating because I only have the options below to configure it:\n\nI do have 60Hz. But, I only have 1920x1080. There is no 2560x1080.\nAs a palliative fix, I tried accessing the settings menu on the LG external monitor device. They present two options: (i) Full Wide and (ii) and Original.\nOn Full Wide, things look a bit stretched out, horizontally speaking.\nSee the PrintScreen (not sure it captures the stretched out feeling, hence I will also send a picture from a phone):\n\n\nAlternatively, the monitor also offers another option for Aspect Rate called \"Original\".\nOn this one, only part of the screen is used. Things do not look stretched out this time:\n\nI do not know much about monitors. And I believe I underestimate the challenge of compatibility.\nIf my understanding is correct, it seems to be a pure physics problem. The MacBook Air  is a light rectangle (close to a square), but the monitor is way more stretched out horizontally. Hence, this incompatibility.\nIs my understanding correct? Is there any palliative action I could take for better experience?\n;;\nUPDATE\nSince it was asked by user @DavidAnderson, I am using an adaptor called Dell Adapter - USB-C to HDMI/VGA/Ethernet/USB 3.0 DA200 to the USB-C to HDMI.\n\nA: The OSD of the monitor tells you everything you need to know:\n\nThe 2560x1080/60HZ resolution may not be supported on some PCs.\n\nNot every computer (read that to mean every GPU) can support the monitor’s native resolution at every refresh rate. That’s unfortunately, the reality of the situation in your case.\nCan your MBA drive this monitor?\nYes.  Optimally?  No.\nThe only palliative solution is to use it with the boxed appearance you’ve shown in your images.\nAs for the linked question/answer, there are a couple comments about it having a “weird resolution.”  It is a weird resolution. That should have been a red flag item to investigate prior to moving forward.\nNow, keep in mind that the MacBook Air M1 can drive up to a 6K display at 60Hz. That doesn’t mean it supports every resolution less than that at 60Hz. Going forward, the best course of action would be to ask LG for all the supported resolutions and refresh rates as well as compatibility with your computer.\n\nA: The MBA can support a variety of resolutions with a different ratio from its own built-in screen: your assumption that it needs to be of similar shape is not accurate.\nHowever, there are limits to sizes and ratios it supports.\nIt is interesting that the display says its resolution \"may not be supported on some PCs\". I did comment that the LG display does have an unusual ratio.\n", "Q: Can Time Machine be used to restore an encrypted APFS volume? I created an encrypted APFS volume on my internal SSD on my MacBook. I also use Time Machine.\nHow can I use Time Machine to:\na) Restore a previous version of the whole encrypted APFS volume?\nb) Restore an old version of an individual file within the encrypted APFS volume?\nRegarding a): What do I have to do to achieve this?\nRegarding b): I assume that this is not possible since Time Machine cannot see inside the encrypted volume. If someone can confirm this, this would be helpful.\nOne solution would be to not use an encrypted APFS volume but an encrypted sparsebundle. But I had trouble increasing its size. An APFS volume in contrast always takes only as much space from its parent as it needs for its content.\n\nA: Time Machine only backs up volumes that are \"mounted\" (meaning they appear in Finder and are browsable).\nIf the encrypted volume was mounted, then Time Machine would back it up like a regular disk, since it's been unencrypted and made available to browse by mounting it.\nIf you enabled encryption on your Time Machine disk, then it would be re-encrypted when it is transferred to the disk. Otherwise, it is unencrypted.\nSo, to answer your question, yes: Time Machine will back up encrypted volumes, provided they are mounted (unlocked) and not in the exclusion list.\n\nI am unsure how to restore the entire volume, however you can certainly access the volume and restore individual files by opening the Time Machine disk, selecting the backup revision, and navigating to the volume. I've attached a screenshot of these steps on my Time Machine disk:\n\n\nA: My solution is now to create a blank image with the Disk Utility app (File - New Image - Blank Image…) instead of a Volume (+ button at the top of the Disk Utility window).\nI chose:\n\n*\n\n*APFS\n\n*256-bit AES encryption\n\n*GUID partition (Apple recommends this for „for all Intel-based and Apple silicon Mac computers“)\n\n*Sparse bundle disk image (so that it is stored as a folder with many files inside for a more efficient backup process)\n\nThe encrypted .sparsebundle is backed-up by Time Machine like other files in the file system.\nI wanted to add the mounted disk to the Time Machine exclusion list so that the decrypted files are not backed up. However, that was not necessary since it was already in the exclusion list. This makes absolutely sense since Time Machine backs up the encrypted .sparsebundle file already.\n", "Q: `open myfile.pdf` raises \"no permission\" error Specifically, opening a terminal and writing open myfile.pdf causes a Dialog box in Preview with\n\nThe file “myfile.pdf” couldn’t be opened because you don’t have permission to view it\"\nTo view or change permissions, select the item in the Finder and choose File > Get Info.\n\nNote this also happens with open -a Preview.app myfile.pdf but does not happen for open -a Skim.app myfile.pdf.

It is a nightmare to work like this on iPad and highly frustrating and embarrassing: I sent an Excel file (by attaching it to an email) to a colleague, which did not reflect my recent changes and was therefore completely wrong.\nIt was suggested to not send Office documents by attaching them to an email but rather send a link. While this may work in most situations, there are times when I actually want to send a copy to a colleague and not a link. The problem also impacted me when duplicating a file, e.g., for a backup, i.e., an old version was duplicated.\nI also experienced that a different (older) version was shown after opening an office document in the Word or Excel apps on iPad after closing it.\nI have experienced these problems for a long time and I have filed several bug reports both to Apple and Microsoft.

When I open the Excel document from the Files app, I get the version I just modified (although the date in the Files app is also yesterday).\n\nImage 1: In the Excel app on iPad, it is confirmed that the file has been saved just now.\n\n \nImage 2: However, in the Files app on iPad, the save date is yesterday.\n\n \nImage 3: The date in OneDrive in Safari is also from yesterday, but it differs from the date in the Files app.\n\n \nImage 4: In the OneDrive app on iPad, the date is also yesterday.\n\n\nA: \nUnreliable saving of office documents also happens in other apps like Word. It is a nightmare to work like this on iPad and highly frustrating and embarrassing...\n\nAs an avid OneDrive, and Microsoft 365 user, I can confidently say that this is due to network connectivity/latency issues.  For whatever reason, the changed file (local to your iPad) didn't get sync'ed.\n\nI sent an Excel file to a colleague, which did not reflect my recent changes and was therefore completely wrong.\n\nWhen you \"send\" the file, are you emailing the file itself, or a link to the document?  If the latter, then this is where the issue is coming from.  The cloud version hasn't updated due yet.\nIf you did edit via the web (you don't have Excel on your iPad), then you should email via the web.  If you send the email by attaching a local file (a cached version not yet sync'ed), you're not sending the latest updated version.\nEither email the link to the document or check sync status before emailing the file as an attachment.\n", "Q: Copy a Time Machine backup for ONE computer to a new external drive The situation: I'm running Ventura (13.1) on an M1 Macbook Air (2020) and I have a 3 TB external HD, format Mac OS Extended (Journaled), that I use as a Time Machine backup volume for 5 different household computers (not using a LAN -- I physically connect the external drive to each computer when I want to run a backup).  It has now filled up, and I have purchased a 5 TB external HD.  I want to move the TM Backup for one of my 5 computers onto the new hard drive.\nThere are multiple articles online explaining how to clone an entire TM backup volume from one external drive to another (many of them explicitly contradicting one another). But I have yet to find any instructions on how to clone the backups for just one computer from an external drive that is used for multiple Macs.\nIs this even possible? If not, I guess my next-best solution is to do a fresh, from-scratch TM backup of the chosen computer onto the new drive, and then delete the old backup from the old drive.  But this raises a related question:  is there a way to delete a backup of just one computer from a TM drive containing backups of multiple machines?\n\nA: These are the basic steps I followed...\n\n*\n\n*Use Disk Utility to format the new external HD as \"Mac OS Extended (Journaled)\".\n\n*In Finder, select Get Info for the new external HD and make sure \"Ignore ownership on this volume\" is not active.\n\n*Stop any ongoing Time Machine backups and disable \"Back Up Automatically\" in Time Machine Settings.\n\n*In Finder, drag and drop the Backups.backupdb folder from your old external HD to your new external HD.\n\n*In Time Machine Settings, click Select Disk... to select the new external HD and re-enable \"Back Up Automatically\".\n\nThese steps are described with more detail and screenshots in the article titled How to Move Time Machine to a New Backup Drive.\nSimilar to you, I used these steps this week to save my TM backups for 2 household Macs from a failing 2TB external HDD which I copied to a new 4TB external SSD. After I selected the new disk in Time Machine Settings, I was worried that the next backup was going to take forever (like a new backup from scratch). Instead, it was incremental and quick and that gave me the assurance that the old backups were intact. I also checked by browsing my old backups using Time Machine.\nEdit: I re-read your question and noticed that you also found this article. As you figured, this will copy all the backups in the Backups.backupdb folder but each computer will have a unique subdirectory which will contain a dated folder for every backup for that computer. If you only want to copy the backups of one computer and discard the rest, then just copy it all and then delete the subdirectories you don't want. There might be a more efficient way where you manually mkdir Backups.backupdb in the new drive and then drag and drop all the files in the Backups.backupdb and then drag and drop only the folder for the one computer.\nAnother note is that if your computer names are unique like mine, then identifying which backup subdirectory belongs to which Mac is obvious. If your computer names are the same, then Time Machine will likely just append a number and it may be somewhat confusing which is the right subdirectory. Then you'll need to look inside the backup for some file that is unique to the one computer.\n", "Q: How to start drawing in Freeform on macOS? I have a problem with starting drawing in Freeform on macOS Ventura. Is this even possible?\nI've heard that freeform will land on macOS in the last update Ventura 13.1 (22C65) and I've opened it and tried to recreate the sample image from the official Freeform marketing page with my small drawing tablet, but I can't find an option to begin drawing.\n\nA: If you select (right mouse click) to add a sketch, it asks you to use your iPad (if you have one), which works.\nEven if I use Freeform on my Wacom One tablet (external monitor attached to my mac) I don't get any pencil functionality.\nSo I assume, no, at the moment (1/2023), it is not possible.\n", "Q: iCloud Drive favorites and tag items have been disappearing frequently from the sidebar in the Files app on iPad and iPhone iCloud Drive favorites have been disappearing frequently from the sidebar in the Files app on iPad and iPhone. After a while, they reappear, then they disappear again. When this happens, tag items are also not shown (wheres the tags themselves are shown in the sidebar).\nFor me, this is a major issue since iPadOS does not have symlinks that I could use to quickly access folders and files. Without favorites and tags, I have to navigate through the whole hierarchy for every file that I need. This is quite cumbersome.\nIt seems that I am not the only person who is affected by this. People have reported related issues since February 2018. Apple has not fixed it in five years:\n\n*\n\n*https://github.com/haiwen/seafile-iOS/issues/208\n\n\n*https://discussions.apple.com/thread/253858370\n\n\n*https://www.reddit.com/r/iPadOS/comments/zls1wn/ipados_162_favorites_missing_from_files_app/\n\n\n*https://www.dropboxforum.com/t5/Integrations/iOS-Files-App-Favorites-Folder-Disappear/td-p/323734\n\n\n*https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYSKFULhPKc\n\nScreenshot 1: No Favorites on iPad\n\nScreenshot 2: Favorites are still shown on iPhone\n\n\nThe following list shows things I tried. So far, nothing helped permanently.\n\n*\n\n*I have sent multiple bug reports to Apple.\n\n\n*I tried to unfavorite folders and re-favorite them, but I cannot even unfavorite folders on my iPad when this happens. — No fix.\n\n\n*I waited: sometimes the favorites re-appeared after some time. — Only temporary fix.\n\n\n*I updated iPadOS and iOS. The problem still exists after updating to iPadOS 16.3. — No fix.\n\n\n*I dragged the favorite folders to the sidebar. — Only temporary fix.\n\n\n*I added tags to the favorite folders. That made them re-appear in the sidebar — Only temporary fix.\n\n\n*I moved the favorite folders into a new folder. — Only temporary fix.\n\n\n*I deleted all my iCloud Drive data, stopped syncing iCloud Drive on all my devices, the started syncing again and copied the data back into iCloud Drive. — Only temporary fix.\n\n\n*I removed third-party apps from my devices that integrated with the Files app: Cryptomator 2 and OneDrive. — Did not fix it.\n\n\n*I deactivated MATLAB under locations in the sidebar — Did not fix it.\n\n\n*I temporarily signed out of iCloud on iPhone, iPad and my MacBook — Did not fix it.\n\n\n*Uninstalled VPN profile and app and did a reset of network settings — Did not fix it.\nIt seems that only a few users experience this. So, what is different  on the iPads of those users in contrast to the majority of users? I’m still looking for a better understanding why this happens and how the problem can be permanently solved.\n\nA: Haven't experienced the finders tag problem. The only thing that comes straight up to my mind sign out of iCloud and back in. This could do the trick if the problem is new after updating your iPad.\nNo freezing and whatsoever. iPad Pro M1.\nHope this helps you.\n", "Q: Accessing Windows from MacOS (or not) We just inherited my mother-in-law's Windows 7 HP laptop.  Last time I used Windows was before I retired in 2014 and that was Windows 10.\nMy MacBook and the HP are on the same 192.168.1.x WiFi and the Mac can ping the HP.  But Finder can't see the HP.  (Yet it still shows my sister's Windows machine—two thousand miles away—which hasn't been reachable in years!)\nWhat do I have to do to get Finder access to files on Windows?  There is an admin account on the HP with no password.  There are five gigabytes of files we need to transfer before we dispose of the HP.  Too slow to transfer that much to iCloud or my website and back.\nSecond best would be getting Windows to accept connections with rsync, sftp, scp, etc. or installing an APFS driver on Windows.  (I have a portable APFS drive, but it has 4GB already on it that I'd rather not squeeze onto some other drive to allow reformatting this one.)\n\nA: The easiest way of fixing this problem might be to make the PC discoverable on the network. I'm sorry, I don't know how to do that but we can do it the other way.\nIf you open the \"Sharing\" pane of System Preferences you can select \"File Sharing\" on the left. This will then allow you to share folder on your Mac. If you click \"Options...\" you can turn on SMB. If you click on \"Edit...\" just under the computer name field you can change the name that the Mac advertises.\nOnce you have done that you should see the Mac in the network from the Windows machine.\nThe other way is to connect from the Mac using the IP address of the Windows computer. In the Finder under \"Go\" at the bottom of the menu is \"Connect to Server...\" select that and enter smb://192.168.1.1/ replacing the IP address in the example with the IP address of the Windows laptop. This assumes you have shared a folder on the Windows laptop.\n\nA: Well, turns out there is an APFS driver for Windows.  But I'd still like to know how to get Finder access and how to remove my sister's machine from Finder.\n", "Q: Is my MacBook Air Hacked? My MacBook Air was sent to a Technical Service from Apple in May 2022 because the login password didn’t work anymore and some strange things happened from that day to the present that concern me.\nThe 1st one is that a program I used recently said to me that the computer has a JailBreak and it is at my own risk use from this device the app.\nFrom investigating a lot through Google about this I discovered using the Terminal of my MacBook  the following output that makes me scared:\n\n\nAs you can see in the images there are two users Leandritus console and Leandritus ttys000.\nIn the description you can see a lot of crashes, reboots and shutdown that I think I didn’t made.\nCan anyone let me know what the information of each item in the terminal means? And if I was hacked what I can do for protect from these people? Buy a new device?\n\nA: The information you have provided does not seem concerning at all, though the stuff about a jailbreak might deserve a new question of its own, with more details.\nThe user name is leandritus and the next field indicates where the user logged in from. Based on your user name here, I assume that's your original user account.\nI guess what happened here is that you lost the password for leandritus and the service guys created a new account macbookpro with a new password for you. There's a third account mac which has logged in once.\nIf you have not enabled remote logins over the network recently, I think we can safely assume all of these were made by someone with physical access to the laptop. The ones on tty* are when you log in from a terminal window and the console ones are when you logged in from the login screen.\nAgain, all of this looks perfectly normal, at least in the absence of additional information to suggest that you have unauthorized activity on your computer.\nAlso, look at the dates - there were weeks between these crashes.\nIn some more detail, the last output indicates the user name, the location where the user logged in from (where known), the time of the login, and the duration of the session. See the manual page for details and additional options.\n(The man page link is to an online version which might differ slightly from what you have installed. The command man last in a terminal window will display the manual page from your local system, which should be authoritative.)\nIf you really suspect that something is wrong, reinstalling the operating system using macOS Recovery (or if you have a really old machine, proper installer media such as an official Apple DVD) should always be sufficient to completely reset everything to factory state.\nObviously, you'll need to make sure you have backups of all your personal files before you do anything drastic, and restore them after the reinstall; but take care to separate out any untrusted executables you might have executed in the past and never run them again if you don't trust them.\n\nA: No.  You are not hacked.\nIt's very easy for people to see a screen on their computer or output from a Terminal that they're not familiar with and jump to the conclusion they've been hacked.  This comes from the disconnect between what is seen in fictional programs on TV and movies that they are \"going to open a port in the firewall and take control of the computer\" followed by some furious typing and unrelated screen animations.\nHacking is 90% social engineering meaning if a hacker interacts with you, it's an attempt to gain your credentials through methods like phishing or infecting you with a trojan.  If a hacker has access to your system it's usually for one of two tactics:\n\n*\n\n*lateral or sideways attack - gain access to your system as a way to access another system close to you (i.e. a server you connect to on your network)\n\n*an attack proxy - attack other remote system while concealing the hackers identity and location (make it look like you are the hacker)\n\nConsole vs TTY\nWhat you are seeing from the output of the last command is a history of where and when you logged in.\n\n*\n\n*Console: A system console or root console is nothing more than the keyboard and screen attached to your computer.\n\n\n*TTY:  This is a \"terminal window.\"  TTY is an acronym that comes from Teletype Terminal or Teleprinter which is the original way people connected to computers (via a serial connection).  The TTYs on your computer are now considered pseudo-TTYs as there is no Teletype Terminal or serial connection but a connection over TCP/IP (the network).\nWhat are you seeing?\nYou are seeing where your user account logged into either a console or a terminal window.  Your last console login was Dec. 31st of which you haven't signed out.  If you see the very top line where it says ttys000 -- still logged in, this is presumably the Terminal window you opened to issue the last command to produce the output you're viewing.\nThe third column (the dates and times) is when you logged in and whether it closed cleanly or if it crashed (you powered off your Mac without logging out, for example).  The last column is the elapsed time of that session.\nAdditional Resources\n\n*\n\n*How can I know if my macbook is hacked?\n\n*Mac Hacked? \"a computer with IP address 128.130.244.179 tried to establish an incoming connection to kernel\"\n\n*How do I prevented the hackers (secret intel) manipulating my terminal again\n", "Q: Why doesn't APFS come with the Journaled option? A quick look in Disk Utility shows that Journaled is not an option with APFS like macOS Extended. Would anyone know why?\n\n\nA: The main benefit you get from journaling is protection against metadata corruption in case of crashes (metadata like directory entries, file names, timestamps etc). APFS has a solution for this builtin, so there is no need to enable journaling specifically.\nFrom Wikipedia:\n\nApple File System is designed to avoid metadata corruption caused by system crashes. Instead of overwriting existing metadata records in place, it writes entirely new records, points to the new ones and then releases the old ones, an approach known as redirect-on-write. This avoids corrupted records containing partial old and partial new data caused by a crash that occurs during an update. It also avoids having to write the change twice, as happens with an HFS+ journaled file system, where changes are written first to the journal and then to the catalog file.\n\n\nA: Roughly speaking, journals are \"logs\" what's about to be done to a file system. They are used to allow some crash protection to file systems which might get corrupted if a write operation is interrupted. For example, ext2 and HFS were vulnerable to these corruptions, so journaling was added which resulted in ext3 and HFS+.\nAPFS on the other hand chose a design that doesn't need this protection. So there is no need for a journal. Likewise, ZFS (which at one point was a candidate to replace HFS and has influenced APFS) doesn't need a journal by design, either.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro A1707 Logic Board Upgrade/Replacement I have an A1707 (15\" 2017 MacBook Pro) with 2.8GHz and 256GB working flawlessly, but I want to upgrade the SSD, because it's filling to capacity every month.\nSo, can I replace my logic board with another one that has a 3.1Ghz and 2TB drive? Or, can I only replace it with another 2.8Ghz with 512GB instead?\n\nA: Yes, you can replace the logic board of the same MacBook Pro vintage.\nIf you are replacing a 2017 15-inch MacBook Pro logic board with another 2017 15-inch MacBook Pro logic board with faster CPU and more drive capacity, then yes, you can swap them out.   In fact, this is what Apple does if you have them replace a logic board due to failure/damage (if they don't convince you to buy a new unit, that is).\nImportant consideration\nIf you are purchasing this logic board on the secondary market (eBay, FB Marketplace, etc.) make sure that the device has been dissociated from the previous owners Apple ID.  If they don't do this, you could be locked out of the device and it would forever be attached to the other user.\n", "Q: Prevent from going to sleep in a KVM usage To help in context, I'm using a Windows Computer and an Air M2 Mac.\nThey are both connected to a KVM which switches between computers while keeping my devices (KB, mouse, and dual monitor). My Mac's lid is closed when I'm working on this setup.\nIf I have something to do on my PC, I switch the KVM to PC then back to my Mac. Then, I have to open the lid of the Mac to get to power on; then I close it again.\nHow can I prevent my Mac going into sleep when switching between computers?\nI tried caffeinate -i -s and I tried changing settings in lockscreen.\n\nA: The key to your answer is the utility pmset which allows you to set various power management settings.\npmset -g cap will list the settings supported by your hardware and pmset -g live will give you the settings currently in use. pmset -g assertions will give you the current status of assertions (which is what caffeinate raises to do its job).\nIf you have a careful read of the man page you can figure out how to stop your computer from going to sleep (pmset sleep 0 will probably do the job but please read the man page). You might also want to write a script to reverse the settings for when you leave the computer and want it to go to sleep.\n", "Q: Partition shows in diskutil command output, but not the Disk Utility application I deleted a partition using the diskutil command and now I can see the free space with diskutil list.

In this case, there is the EFI partition (disk0s3) named EFI - ASAHI. The command below would remove this partition.\ndiskutil eraseVolume free none disk0s3\n\nYou could then use the command below to add the free space back to the APFS partition (disk0s2).\ndiskutil apfs resizecontainer disk0s2 0\n\n", "Q: Permanently dismiss \"New iCloud Terms and Conditions\" on macOS Ventura This is essentially a duplicate of Permanently Dismiss \"New iCloud Terms and Conditions\" on MacOS High Sierra except that my question is for the newest OS (I'm using 13.1), as it seems the problem has gotten worse in the intervening years, and there is also no longer an \"iCloud\" entry under system settings as described in the linked answer.\nI don't use iCloud, I don't want to use iCloud, I will never want to use iCloud.  And if that weren't enough, this is my work laptop and I legally can't use iCloud even if I wanted to.\nNevertheless, I get this popup multiple times per day.

Some 6 % in just 10 min without actually running anything.\nIt won't go into sleep mode automatically and gets warm just sitting there without any app actually being fully running (just 2 in the background).\nOverall, I'm not happy with these things and IDK if Apple would do anything about it.\nI don't have any extended Apple Care other than what comes with it, and IIRC, it's only the first year.\n\nA: \nI have an iPad 9 that is about 10 months old and IDK if I should bring it in before the 1 year is up.\n\nYes.  If you have a problem, take it in.  Once the warranty is up, Apple has no obligation to repair/replace your device. They have been known to do things outside the warranty period, but there are no guarantees.\n\nThe battery is much weaker than I expected. Some 6% in just 10 min without actually running anything.\n\nThat doesn’t sound too bad, but it may be indicative of a growing issue. It also deprnds on the App.  If it requires lots of CPU and or generates lots of network traffic, it will drain the battery faster than an app that doesn’t require as many resources.\n\nOverall, I'm not happy with these things and IDK if Apple would do anything about it.\n\nWell, it’s guaranteed that Apple won’t do anything if you don’t take it in.  But, you shouldn’t go in blindly.  There are several battery health apps like Battery Testing or Battery Life that can supply you with diagnostic info.\nThere is also the built-in battery status in Settings -> Battery that will tell you what’s consuming your battery.\n", "Q: Can a locked file be moved in macOS? I have a file which I've locked since I've accidentally changed it a few times when I meant to just use it unchanged for reference.

With the \"Multi-output device\" feature in audio midi setup in macOS, we are able to use a MacBook's internal speaker and an external Bluetooth speaker simultaneously to play the same music.\nHowever, the issue is that the external speaker might have a larger latency, so that the audio is not in sync.\nIs there a way to increase the latency of built-in speaker by an amount via some software so that by adjusting a bit, we can match the internal and external speakers?\nAlso, how can I adjust the relative loudness of each device in a multi-output device?\n\nA: This requires more sophisticated routing capability than you might at first think.\nThere are a few utilities that can intercept a stream on its way to your outputs & speakers, but the simpler ones can only affect the entire stream, they can't split it & handle each part separately.\nThe cheapest app I can think of that could do this would be Rogue Ameoba's Audio Hijack. There is a more expensive app, Loopback from the same company, but it's harder to manage at hobbyist level. [There is also a cheaper, much more consumer-oriented one, SoundSource, which is also very good… but it can't do this task.]\nAudio Hijack can actually intercept the audio stream at any point, whilst also being able to pass it through. This would give you the chance to send  signal to Bluetooth, then run the pass-through into a delay & volume control, before sending it onward to the internal speakers.\n\nIgnore the actual routing details, this is just an example.\nThis would give you control over the delay & relative volumes. One issue you may find is that Bluetooth doesn't have any kind of fixed delay amount, it can fluctuate depending on conditions. It was never designed for critical listening. The only other thing is that Audio Hijack needs to be running & the 'Record' button, bottom left, pressed [even though you're not actually using it to record anything].\nThere's a free demo if you wanted to try it out.\nI have to add a slice of personal opinion here - Rogue Amoeba's contribution to the Mac's audio routing capabilities is second to none. Others exist; none integrate so smoothly.

Can someone tell me how I can have all my synced files back to my external hard drive with this new update? (Photo attached)enter image description here\n\nA: Your files are gone.\n(Unless you have a Time Machine backup)\nYou should never use “local cache” as a backup.  Local cache is a temporary storage (cache) of your files so that it can speed up retrieval of files or give you offline access when there is no Internet connectivity.\nAt minimum, you should be using Time Machine, but you should adhere to the old adage that “a file isn’t backed up unless it’s in three places.”\nSyncing files to….\nIn your case it’s an external drive; it could be a network folder or a cloud drive.  Syncing files is not backing up as you’ve found.  With a backup, once a change is made, it immediately gets propagated everywhere you sync too.  With a backup like Time Machine, when a change is made, it is copied to the backup drive and indexed by date.  In other words, you get a rudimentary versioning.  If you need to go back to a version of document you had last week, Time Machine allows you to do this.\nRecovery software\nYou can try a tool like Disk Drill to attempt to recover your files.  If your external drive is an a traditional spinning drive, your chances are fair to good.  If the drive on your computer(s) are SSDs, then the odds are very, very small you’ll recover them from there.\n", "Q: How to make device with Apple IOS 16.1+ stop using \"Limit IP tracking\" We have a public WiFi with auth portal, where access to the internet is granted to a user after watching ads.
