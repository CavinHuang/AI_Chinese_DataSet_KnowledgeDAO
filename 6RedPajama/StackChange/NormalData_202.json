So I have to do everything using commands.\nIn AWS instance, I have sudo access as 'ubuntu' user. I created a new Linux user 'wpsite' and created home directory for it. I managed to transfer all files & directories from old server to /home/wpsite/public_html.\nThen I created a new database 'WP_DB', and a new MySQL user 'wp_db_user' and granted all access to WP_DB.\nCREATE USER wp_db_user@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'thepwd';\nGRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON WP_DB.* TO wp_db_user@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'thepwd';\nFLUSH PRIVILEGES;\n\nNow, I changed wp-config.php file\ndefine('DB_NAME', 'WP_DB');\ndefine('DB_USER', 'wp_db_user');\ndefine('DB_PASSWORD', 'thepwd');\ndefine('DB_HOST', 'localhost');\n\nThen I restored old WP database from sql dump, using wp_db_user account (tried with root user as well). Next, I created a vhost configuration in Apache2 with proper server name & alias, and directory path, and changed A-Record of the domain to AWS instance. Upto this point, everything went smooth. There were no error.\nWhen I visit the website, the wordpress site is displayed, but problem is that certain contents are missing including title of site.

I can also log in to WP admin section on new server, which uses same database without any error.

Routing is done on a network level and not on a port level.  You need to sub-segment your network in 3 separate networks and bind each network to each network card and then have your router route the packets to the correct Ethernet port.\nAs each network card has its own network address, any packets coming in with a certain address will also go back out on that network.\nE.g.: \n\n\n*\n\n*eth0: 192.168.100.0/24 LAN\n\n*eth1: 192.168.101.0/24 Access Point\n\n*Eth3: Default gateway/24: ADSL modem\n\n\nThen all traffic that is not for 192.168.0.0/16 will go out to the Internet and all local traffic will stay local. \nTo do port forwarding you have two options:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you add an additional piece of hardware like a Big-IP between the router and the server, that will be able to inspect the packets and depending on ports send stuff to Eth0 and Eth1 by changing the IP address on-the-fly and then the server will then again send it out on the correct interface, and the BigIP will then convert it back to whatever it was...\n\n*You can also drop the router entirely and use the server as a router to accomplish the same thing, and then you just use iptables to inspect the packets and route them around.\nBut what you're trying to do is impossible (only using a hardware router and software routing in the server) as there is no notion of \"HTTP/FTP\" as that is on a port level...  :-(\n", "Q: Installed Ubuntu and now cannot Boot into it!

How to solve this problem as I can not change my boot preferences everytime. Please Help me out as soon as possible..\n\nA: Assuming your BIOS was set as UEFI first when you installed Ubuntu, set it back to UEFI first and then boot using the ´boot-repair` CD. It's an Ubuntu-based boot disk that you can download. Once booted select automatic repair. It should fix your grub and allow dual boot again for both Windows and Ubuntu.\n\nA: Your steps #2 and #3 were mistakes. They opened the door for more complex (and unnecessary) boot paths. The Ubuntu installer does a poor job of recognizing potential dual-boot problems, so the extra options end up being extra options to create problems, nothing more.\nHatterman's suggestion will probably work. Another option is to reset your firmware to not support BIOS/CSM/legacy-mode booting and re-install Ubuntu. A third is to boot the existing Ubuntu installation using the USB flash drive or CD-R version of my rEFInd boot manager and then install the rEFInd Debian package or PPA.

You should be using one of these releases' installers to install your 14.04 rather than trying to update from 13.04 to 13.10 (which is also end of life) to 14.04 (you should also not do that because with each upgrade you run the risk of breaking the operating system).\nYou should only be using one of thsoe versions, using ISOs obtained from http://releases.ubuntu.com or one of the CD image mirrors.\n", "Q: What after download Ubuntu on windows 8 So I've got some problems while downloading Ubuntu.\nAs I clicked on the downloadlink ( the first one you see when you get on the destkop page), the Ubuntu link started downloading.

Depending on which browser you're using and how you configured it the file got saved somewhere and you can open it with you DVD bruning application (or consider creating an USB pendrive as described in the installation guide).

Using xdotool, you can make it move the mouse to the position of the Applications menu, open it and automatically move back to its original position.\nSince all happens very quickly and the mouse is moved back to its original position, you won't notice it.\n\nThe script assumes your Applications menu is in the upper left corner, like in the image above. If that is not the case, the coordinates in cmd1 have to be altered.\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport subprocess\nimport time\n\ncursordata = subprocess.check_output([\"xdotool\", \"getmouselocation\"]).decode(\"utf-8\").split()\nloc = [d.split(\":\")[1] for d in cursordata[:2]]\ncmd1 = \"xdotool mousemove 10 5\"; cmd2 = \"xdotool click 1\"; cmd3 = \"xdotool mousemove \"+(\" \").join(loc)\nfor cmd in [cmd1, cmd2, cmd3]:\n    subprocess.Popen([\"/bin/bash\", \"-c\", cmd])\n    time.sleep(0.05)\n\nIn detail:\nfetch the current mouse position:\ncursordata = subprocess.check_output([\"xdotool\", \"getmouselocation\"]).decode(\"utf-8\").split()\n\nParse the output (x/y) into coordinates:\nloc = [d.split(\":\")[1] for d in cursordata[:2]]\n\nRun the commands [cmd1, cmd2, cmd3] to subsequently:\n\n\n*\n\n*move the mouse to the Applications menu\n\n*click\n\n*move the mouse back to wherever it was\n\n\nfor cmd in [cmd1, cmd2, cmd3]:\n    subprocess.Popen([\"/bin/bash\", \"-c\", cmd])\n    time.sleep(0.05)\n\nHow to use the script\n\n\n*\n\n*Install xdotool:\nsudo apt-get install xdotool\n\n\n*Paste the script into an empty file, save it as open_appmenu.py\n\n*Test-run it with the command:\npython3 /path/to/open_appmenu.py\n\n\n*If all works well, add it to a shortcut key: choose: System Settings > \"Keyboard\" > \"Shortcuts\" > \"Custom Shortcuts\". Click the \"+\" and add the command:\npython3 /path/to/open_appmenu.py\n\nMove to the other items\nOnce you opened the Applications menu, you can simply switch to the next item with the arrow keys.\n\nEdit: generalized version\nBelow a version of the script that can be used in a flexible way, to click on the screen on any position, to be changed easily. The script can be run with two options:\n\n\n*\n\n*to set (remember) the current mouse location:\nrun_click -set\n\n\n*to click on the last-remembered position:\nrun_click -run\n\nIf no position was set, a zenity message appears, inviting to set a position: \n\nThe script creates a hidden file; ~/.run_click where it stores the latest remembered coordinates.\nAs a test, I put both commands under the key combinations: Ctrl+Alt+R, and Ctrl+Alt+A, making it easy to change the click position on the spot.\nHow to set up\n\n\n*\n\n*like in the first script, Install xdotool:\nsudo apt-get install xdotool\n\n\n*copy the script below into an empty file, save it as run_click (no extension) in ~/bin (create the directory if necessary) and make the script executable.\n\n*If you just created ~/bin, run source ~/.profile.\n\n*Test both commands, first run_click -set, then run_click -run to see if all works as expected.\n\n*Add both commands to two different key combinations: choose: System Settings > \"Keyboard\" > \"Shortcuts\" > \"Custom Shortcuts\".

I wish to add Ubuntu 64 bit to Windows 8, and the installation guide mentions booting from USB or DVD. If I burn the downloaded Ubuntu to an empty USB stick, then put the stick into my computer, what happens next?  \n\nA: Simply writing ('burning' is a term reserved for making optical discs such as DVD-R and CD-R) the software folder to a USB stick will not make it bootable. Burning a 'master' type DVD with the ISO file you downloaded will make that DVD bootable. The procedure for USB is different.\nInstead, for USB, install UNETBOOTIN or another USB Boot creation program to a Windows machine. That UNETBOOOTIN-type program will extract the files from what you downloaded, and put them in their proper order on the USB flash drive so you may boot from it. \nEither way (and thanks to Wilf got mentioning this), please also read Installing Ubuntu on a Pre-Installed Windows 8 (64-bit) System (UEFI Supported).h\nPlease make sure to also make a backup of your data from Windows first, and for good measure, also please clone the entire Windows installation using Clonezilla or some other cloning program, for easy restoration if something goes wrong.\n", "Q: dkms Installed kernel module but not working after reboot I bought a keyboard that is shown on lsusb:\nBus 002 Device 009: ID 0c45:7603 Microdia\n\nbut the Ctrl, Windows/Super and Alt buttons are all mapped to Shift button.

I want to buy a mouse for my PC, but as I was searching I saw in the product details that it had to have Windows as the OS.  I have a Ubuntu/Windows duel boot and I was wondering if mice for Windows can also be used on Ubuntu.\n\nA: Basic USB/USB wireless mice normally work (still have to find one that doesn't). \nIf the mouse is a gaming/special mouse, it depends. Most of the time it will just work as a normal mouse or will require quite a lot of configuration, unless the manufacturer explicitly support Linux. Said in other way, the additional buttons will probably be recognized by the system, but they are not normally assigned to anything, and if the manufacturer does not provide info, configuring them will be a bit of a pain. \nYou can see something in the Ubuntu Community help and in the (as ever) nicely and complete Arch wiki help page (most of it will work in Ubuntu too, but you have to adapt conf files locations and so on).  \nIf you think of a specific mouse, you can ask (please --- another) specific question to see if anyone with the same model has solved the thing for you. \n\nA: The short answer is yes.\n\n\n*\n\n*If is a USB (wired or wireless) mouse, all usb mouses (all which I know) are universal and they uses USB HID (human interface device).\n\n*If is a Bluetooth mouse there aren't so many troubles.\n\n*Any mouse (wired or wireless) that has more than 3 buttons can give some troubles, however, I have one with back and forth buttons that worked plugging it.\n\nA: If it is just a standard, three button, usb mouse, it should. Linux comes with drivers that work with most hardware. \n\nA lot of hardware will say that they work with just Windows and/or Mac. I have Linux Mint (which is basically the same thing as Ubuntu) connected to the Internet with a usb adapter that says it will only work with Windows, and it works perfectly on linux.\n\nA: From my experience both of your choices should work, since they all have build-in memory. I had the same problem recently, did some google research and decided to buy Cooler Master Recon. People already confirmed it's compability with Linux. The keys and the lights worked out of the box, but it was also declared to work only under Windows.\nSame thing with the previous A4 Tech. It show no problems as well, I believe because of build-in memory.\nThough, you will have to download manufacturer software, install it in Windows to configure your mouse the way you want. \n", "Q: problem while updating backbox using sudo apt-get update [*] starting at 19:46:20\n\n[19:46:20] [INFO] updating sqlmap to the latest development version from the GitHub repository\n[19:46:20] [INFO] update in progress ..\n[19:46:22] [ERROR] update could not be completed ('From git github com sqlmapproject sqlmap branch HEAD FETCH_HEAD error Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by merge udf postgresql linux 32 8 3 lib_postgresqludf_sys so udf postgresql linux 32 8 4 lib_postgresqludf_sys so udf postgresql linux 32 9 0 lib_postgresqludf_sys so udf postgresql linux 64 8 2 lib_postgresqludf_sys so udf postgresql linux 64 8 3 lib_postgresqludf_sys so udf postgresql linux 64 8 4 lib_postgresqludf_sys so udf postgresql linux 64 9 0 lib_postgresqludf_sys so Please commit your changes or stash them before you can merge Aborting')\n[19:46:22] [INFO] for Linux platform it's required to install a standard 'git' package (e.g.: 'sudo apt-get install git')\n\n[*] shutting down at 19:46:22\n\n\nA: According to this GH issue, you should run the following commands:\ncd /tmp\ngit clone https://github.com/sqlmapproject/sqlmap.git sqlmap\ncd sqlmap\npython sqlmap.py --update\n\nPrefix python command with sudo if necessary.\n", "Q: Primary VS. Logical Types When Using Manual Partitioning At Ubuntu Installation I am very new to Ubuntu, and I apologize beforehand if my terminology is incorrect.  I'm constantly learning new things with all of this! I am working with Ubuntu 14.04 (I believe.) LTS. \nI read very thorough instructions for using manual partitioning at Ubuntu installation titled: \"How to Use Manual Partitioning During Installation?\" Although I found this extremely helpful (even the additional comments), I am still confused about part of this process.  \nIn the steps for using manual partitioning on a clean disk, it was recommended to assign the \"/\" root fs as logical.  However, at the end of the instructions, it was suggested that for MBR scheme disks \"/\" root fs be assigned as primary.  \nThe computer I am working on did, at one point, have an MBR partition set-up on it.  However, after several mishaps, the partitions that were automatically placed, were wiped out.  From what I can tell, the hard disk no longer has any such partitions. \nMy questions are in regards to the \"/\" root fs partition, the (optional) \"/boot\" partition, the \"/tmp\" partition, and the \"/var\" partition.  In the step-by-step instructions that I read, initially it was instructed to set \"/\" root fs to logical. Later it was recommended to set this partition to primary for MBR schemed disks. \nGiven my hard disks current state, am I better off (or is it recommended) to set \"/\" root fs as primary or logical?  Could anyone please explain (in a way I might easily understand) the difference between primary and logical partition types? Which type(s) would I then set the \"/boot\", \"/tmp\", and \"/var\" partitions? \n\nA: Every Windows system must have its own primary partition and there only can be a maximum of 4 primary + extended partitions. Not 4 each but [number of primary partitions] + [number of extended partitions] <= 4.\nSo put everything which isn't a Windows system partition into an extended partition.\n", "Q: Is used content of memory saved to disk during suspension?

These instructions continued to say that \"/home\", \"/boot\", \"/tmp\", and \"/var\" partitions also be set to ext4.  However, slightly contradicting its previous statements, these instructions said that \"/home\" could also be set as reiserfs--stating that it is a quicker type, but that ext4 was more flexible. \nConsidering that I am a first-time user, having prior experience only with Windows OS, these are all extremely foreign to me.  What file type(s) should I set these partitions to in order to achieve optimal system performance?  \n\nA: Ext4 is the default and most widely used on Ubuntu.

I was faced with a black screen, once I restarted the system.\nResearch on ask ubuntu pointed me to a solution where you have to replace the quiet spalsh with nomodeset. I tried that but to no avail. The graphics would still not be corrected. \nI have tried the following as of now\nSince my system is an AMD system with ATI Radeon graphics card, so I also tried this\nradeon.modeset=0\n\nBut the issue still persisted.\nI then tried changing the GRUB_GFXMODE line in the grub file to have that match the system resolution which is 1024x768.\nBut this step has also failed to correct the graphics situation. Am I missing some drivers from the Linux part, because the graphics are perfectly fine if I boot Windows.\nSystem Configuration :\nAMD A4 Vision\nDual Core ATI Radeon Graphics 1GB\nWindows 7/ Ubuntu 14.04 LTS\n4 GB RAM\n\nA: So after searching a lot on the internet I finally corrected the graphics on my system. \nI came upon a bug filed for Ubuntu 14.04.2, which is the version I am using. \nHere is the link to the bug filed :bug #1424491\nScroll down to comment #24 by Nestor Acevedo. I followed the commands mentioned by him\nsudo apt-get install libcheese* \n\nfollowed by\nsudo apt-get install xserver-xorg-core \n\nand finally installed the fglrx updates through this command\nsudo apt-get install fglrx\n\nThis corrected the graphics distortion on my system. \n", "Q: How do I get the MAC address of my router? Is there a Linux command that allows me to get the MAC address of my router?\n\nA: If you don't know the IP of your router, it's most likely your gateway which you can get from the route command:\n$ route -n\nKernel IP routing table\nDestination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags Metric Ref    Use Iface\n0.0.0.0         192.168.0.1     0.0.0.0         UG    0      0        0 eth0\n192.168.0.0     0.0.0.0         255.255.255.0   U     0      0        0 eth0\n\nNote the line with the flags UG. The address in the Gateway column of that line is what you're looking for. Then follow 2707974's suggestion with arp -n (ping the IP if it doesn't show up at first), and find the matching line:\n$ arp -n\nAddress                  HWtype  HWaddress           Flags Mask            Iface\n192.168.0.1              ether   00:11:22:33:44:55   C                     eth0\n192.168.0.2              ether   66:77:88:99:aa:bb   C                     eth0\n\nHere, your router's MAC would be 00:11:22:33:44:55.\n\nA: I like one-liners:\narping -f -I $(ip route show match 0/0 | awk '{print $5, $3}')\n\narping shows the MAC associated with the default gateway IP address from the output of ip route show match 0/0, parsed by awk.\n\nA: Here is one-liner which works in dash, bash and zsh:\nip neigh|grep \"$(ip -4 route list 0/0|cut -d' ' -f3) \"|cut -d' ' -f5|tr '[a-f]' '[A-F]'\n\n\n*\n\n*ip -4 route list 0/0 returns something like:\n\n\ndefault via 192.168.0.1 dev eth1 proto static metric 100\n\n\n\n*we get IP from that line as third field with cut and grep line containing that IP and immediate space after it from the output of network neighborhood. (space is required to avoid matching of 192.168.0.1 with 192.168.0.10), the matched line would be something like:\n\n\n192.168.0.1 dev eth1 lladdr ca:fe:ba:be:be:af REACHABLE\n\n\n\n*Now we get fifth field and make it uppercase:\n\n\nCA:FE:BA:BE:BE:AF\n\n\nA: Is not a complete solution, but you check arp -n.\nddd@mmm ~ $ arp -n\nAddress                  HWtype  HWaddress           Flags Mask            Iface\nxxx.xxx.xxx.xxx          ether   00:e0:1e:b4:12:42   C                     eth0\nyyy.yyy.yyy.yyy          ether   00:14:78:52:28:d2   C                     wlan0\n\n\nA: This is an improved version of Grief's answer. It is possible for ip -4 route list 0/0 to return more than one line (IP), in which case the complete one liner doesn't work. So the following modified version only uses the first line that ip -4 route list 0/0 returns. \nip neigh|grep \"$(ip -4 route list 0/0|head -1|cut -d' ' -f3) \"|cut -d' ' -f5|tr '[a-f]' '[A-F]'\n\n\nA: Don't use the obsoleted commands ifconfig(8), arp(8) or route(8).  Use the new command that replace them and can do more, ip(8).\nUse ip route list to see which default router your machine have.  That should be a line wich starts with default (or 0.0.0.0) and have the IP address to the router after.  If you uses IPv6, just add the -6 switch, ip -6 route list.\ndefault via 192.168.11.1 dev eth0  proto static \n\nTo see the MAC address of the default routers IP address, use ip neigh and look up the line with the IP address and MAC address after lladdr.e\n192.168.11.1 dev eth0 lladdr 1c:af:f7:XX:XX:XX REACHABLE\n\nIf you don't find a machine in the list, you need to connect to it, because it has been removed from the list because not used for a while.  So just try:\nping -c 3 192.168.11.1\n\nThen try the ip neigh command again. The option -c 3 will restrict ping to only send three ICMP ECHO messages and then end.  If not set, it will run until you stop the program with C-c.\n", "Q: Partitioning after Windows to Ubuntu migration As will be apparent from my question I am quite new at Linux.\nI migrated from Windows7 to Linux[Ubuntu]. After the installation was over, I figured out that all the partitions have been overridden and now only a single partition exists.\nIs there any way to create partitions now?\n\n\n\nA: First of all: There are two partitions, not one.\nAnd yes, you can change the partitions. Boot a live system (so the hard drive isn't accessed) and open GParted. Resize the big partition from the right and you have space for more partitions. Resizing it from the left to the right is also possible, however, this will take a lot longer since all data has to be copied.\nIt is also important to mention that changing something on your partitions always comes with a risk, especially if there is a power failure and you're not working on a laptop with a battery or behind an uninterruptible power supply.\n", "Q: In files It wont find music!

But you should have a firewall in your server. I would recommend ufw(1) as a good firewall for a server for you to have a look at.\nAn alternative to VPN you could also use is IPv6, and let gogoc(8) mannage a IPv6 tunnel.  But you still need to have a firewall.\nYou might also want to look at OwnCloud as a file/cloud server.\n\nA: Everything is possible, but some of it is complex.\nStart with a base of Ubuntu server 14.04 LTS and install packages as you go.

But when viewing those user accounts in my System Settings > User Accounts settings I noticed that all of those accounts created by OSSEC are disabled, should I enable? If not, what do they do if they are disabled, and what would be the purpose of having them?\nHere is what the new user accounts that it created are called (they are all Standard user accounts):\n\n\n*\n\n*ossecr\n\n*ossecm\n\n*ossec\n\nOS Information:\nDescription:    Ubuntu 14.10\nRelease:    14.10\n\n\nA: Those users are users created for OSSEC and you should not change them. They are disabled because you need not see them and need not use them. Very simple: this software locks down these users so a normal user can not mess with them. If someone knows your admin password and gets access you are in deep problems anyeways and a normal user can not change these users settings. So the integrity of the checks OSSEC wants to perform can be sort of guaranteed.\nThe makefile has a lot of settings that include the users you mention and a couple of groups. Default is:\nUser settings:\nOSSEC_GROUP:     ossec\nOSSEC_USER:      ossec\nOSSEC_USER_MAIL: ossecm\nOSSEC_USER_REM:  ossecr\n\nIf you look at the daemon it explains parts of the users:\n\nossec-agentd\nossec-agentd is the client side daemon that communicates\n  with the server. It runs as ossec and is chrooted to /var/ossec by\n  default.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Main point here is \"chrooted\": to prevent someone messing with the ossec user and being able to circumvent the checks OSSEC wants to perform it is disabled by default. \n\n\nSame applies for ossecm:\n\nossec-maild\nThe ossec-maild daemon sends OSSEC alerts via email. ossec-maild is started by ossec-control. Configuration for ossec-maild is handled in the ossec.conf. (see ossec.conf: Global options)\n\n\n\n*\n\n*The default user used for the mail checks is ossecm.\n\n\nSame applies for ossecr:\n\nossec-remoted\nossec-remoted is the server side daemon that communicates with the agents. It can listen to port 1514/udp (for OSSEC communications) and/or 514 (for syslog). It runs as ossecr and is chrooted to /var/ossec by default. ossec-remoted is configured in the  section of ossec.conf. (see ossec.conf: Remote Options)\n\nTheir documentation is pretty decent. Have a look at the manual, FAQ and user cookbooks.\nIn general: I would take software to scan for root kits and intrusion detection as is. These pieces of software should have the security tied down as much as possible. \n", "Q: Netflix using native html5 in chrome--why no HD?

How can I get information about a package before installing it, from the terminal?\nI mean something like man pages, but accessible even before the package is installed.\n\nA: dman Retrieves Manual Pages\nIn practice, viewing a package's brief description (as mchid suggests) is usually what you'll want to see, to decide if you want the package. However, if you like you can view a manpage provided by a package that has not yet been installed, using the dman utility.\ndman is provided by the bikeshed  package. You can install that in the Software Center, or with sudo apt-get install bikeshed.\nThen use dman like man.\ndman is a script that retrieves manual pages over the Internet and displays them, so you have to be connected to the Internet to use it successfully. (But you probably are, because in your specific scenario you're about to install a package.) It also often runs slowly, so be prepared to wait several seconds.\nIf dman's database doesn't have your release, you can specify another.\nDue to a bug dman doesn't work right on some releases of Ubuntu. For now you can get around the problem by viewing another release's version of the manpage you want (this workaround was suggested by Marius Gedminas in a comment on the bug report). You use the adjective part of the codename, in all lower case (e.g., precise from 12.04 Precise Pangolin, trusty from 14.04 Trusty Thar).

If you want to do this from the command-line, you can use a text-based web browser.\nIf you like, you could even define a function in .bashrc so you have a command that opens up a text-based web browser and searches for the term passed as its argument:\nwman() { links2 \"http://manpages.ubuntu.com/cgi-bin/search.py?q=$1\"; }\n\nFor that particular function definition to work, the links2  package must be installed. It will cause the wman function to be defined automatically in each newly created interactive shell, but not in shells that were started before .bashrc was edited (you could simply run the function definition in those shells, though).\nThen I can search for manual pages, and select between pages in different sections of the manual, for whichever Ubuntu release's version of the manual I like:\nek@Io:~$ wman chmod\n\n                                            Ubuntu Manpage: Searching (p1 of 2) \n                                 Ubuntu manuals                                 \n                                                                                \n   _____________________ go                                                     \n                                                                                \n   +------------------------------------------------------------------------+   \n   |  lucid      precise    trusty     utopic     Section Description       |   \n   |  10.04 LTS  12.04 LTS  14.04 LTS  14.10                                |   \n   |  chmod(1),  chmod(1),  chmod(1),  chmod(1),  (1) - Executable          |   \n   |  chmod(1)   chmod(1)   chmod(1)   chmod(1)   programs or shell         |   \n   |                                              commands                  |   \n   |  chmod(2),  chmod(2),  chmod(2),  chmod(2),  (2) - System calls        |   \n   |  chmod(2)   chmod(2)   chmod(2)   chmod(2)   (functions provided by    |   \n   |                                              the kernel)               |   \n   |                                              (3) - Library calls       |   \n   |  chmod(3)   chmod(3)   chmod(3)   chmod(3)   (functions within         |   \n   |                                              program libraries)        |   \n   |      .          .          .          .

They appear because you manually removed the older kernel version they pointed at, so now the links have no target any more. Their only purpose is to allow the system to fall back to the previous kernel version automatically if the last update failed or is not compatible. But as the linked files got deleted by your autoremove, it is right that the links got deleted.\nWhen you run sudo update-grub now again, you will see that there is no warning any more.\nThe kernel message is unrelated and is another question altogether.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 crossover connection cannot ping I am trying to connect two ubuntu 14.04 pc to each other by using crossover cable. \nFrom network settings i gave IP addresses as ;(Ipv4 manual)\nPC1 - IP:10.0.0.1 Network Mask:255.255.255.0\nPC2 - IP:10.0.0.2 Network Mask:255.255.255.0\nPC1 is the server and it has apache installed.

What does mce stand for? And is this apparent hardware error anything that I should worry about?\n\nOS Information:\nDescription:    Ubuntu 14.10\nRelease:    14.10\n\n\nA: Machine Check Exception:\n\nA Machine Check Exception (MCE) is a type of computer hardware\n  error that occurs when a computer's central processing unit detects a\n  hardware problem.\n\nYour computer experienced a hardware error and the kernel logged an event in a buffer. You can use mcelog to log and view the machine check events. From mcelog manpage:\n\nX86 CPUs report errors detected by the CPU as machine check events\n  (MCEs). These can be data corruption detected in the CPU caches, in\n  main memory by an integrated memory controller, data transfer errors\n  on the front side bus or CPU interconnect or other internal errors.\n  Possible causes can be cosmic radiation, instable power supplies,\n  cooling problems, broken hardware, running systems out of\n  specification, or bad luck.\nMost errors can be corrected by the CPU by internal error correction\n  mechanisms. Uncorrected errors cause machine check exceptions which\n  may kill processes or panic the machine. A small number of corrected\n  errors is usually not a cause for worry, but a large number can\n  indicate future failure.\nWhen a corrected or recovered error happens the x86 kernel writes a\n  record describing the MCE into a internal ring buffer available\n  through the /dev/mcelog device. mcelog retrieves errors from\n  /dev/mcelog, decodes them into a human readable format and prints them\n  on the standard output or optionally into the system log.\n\nIf you didn't notice any crash, probably the error was successfully corrected.

In particular, you may have seen loops that iterate through filenames, expanding a variable inside double quotes so it does get expanded but doesn't have its value split into separate words.

I have attempted this install method multiple times and any guidance would be greatly appreciated.\n(Update) after setting the boot priority in the same restart, I am now getting this result:\n\n\nA: First, it's unclear what you mean that you \"dealt with UEFI.\" There's a LOT of misinformation floating around about EFI-mode booting, so a vague statement that you \"dealt with\" it could mean that you've followed appropriate advice or that you've followed any of the many (in fact, perhaps more numerous than correct) pages that present iffy or flat-out wrong information. My Web page on Linux UEFI installations is accurate, to the best of my knowledge, but is not Ubuntu-specific. The Ubuntu wiki page on UEFI is also reasonably accurate, although I haven't studied it in depth.\nSecond, one very common problem with creating Ubuntu installation optical discs is accidentally creating a disc that contains the .iso file, rather than burning the .iso file as a disc image. If you open the disc you burned in Windows and see a single .iso file as its contents, it's burned incorrectly; you should see over a dozen files and directories:\nautorun.inf  casper  EFI      isolinux    pics  preseed             ubuntu\nboot         dists   install  md5sum.txt  pool  README.diskdefines  wubi.exe\n\nThat's what's on a 14.10 AMD64 desktop image.

What command can I run to get just the IP address of my router?\nWith this command I should have only IP of my router and not, for example, the whole routing table (as when I run route -n).\n\nA: As you usually use route -n, you can try this sed solution coupled with route -n:\nroute -n | sed -nr 's/(0\\.0\\.0\\.0) +([^ ]+) +\\1.*/\\2/p' \n\nHere is a test:\n$ route -n\nKernel IP routing table\nDestination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags Metric Ref    Use Iface\n0.0.0.0         192.168.1.1     0.0.0.0         UG    0      0        0 eth0\n169.254.0.0     0.0.0.0         255.255.0.0     U     1000   0        0 eth0\n192.168.0.0     0.0.0.0         255.255.240.0   U     0      0        0 eth0\n\n$ route -n | sed -nr 's/(0\\.0\\.0\\.0) +([^ ]+) +\\1.*/\\2/p' \n192.168.1.1\n\nAnother way would be to use grep:\n$ route -n | tr -s ' ' | grep -Po \"(?<=0\\.0\\.0\\.0 )[^ ]+(?= 0\\.0\\.0\\.0)\"\n192.168.1.1\n\nAs @AvinashRaj has pointed out this can be done by only using grep (no need to squeeze the spaces using tr):\nroute -n | grep -Po \"0\\.0\\.0\\.0\\s*\\K\\S+(?=\\s*0\\.0\\.0\\.0)\"\n192.168.1.1\n\n\nA: One-liners:\n\n\n*\n\n*nm-tool | grep -i gateway | xargs echo | cut -d' ' -f2\n\n*nm-tool | grep -i gateway | awk '{print $2}\n\n*netstat -nr | awk '$1 == \"0.0.0.0\"{print$2}'\n\n*arp -n | awk '{print $1}' Note: works only if your machine is the only one on the network\n\n*ip route show | grep -i 'default via'| awk '{print $3 }'\noutput: 192.168.0.1 for me\nNOTE: \nFor 15.04 and later, there is no nm-tool , so use nmcli dev show <IFACE>.

Note, that if you have two or more connections there, you may need top remove xargs echo | cut -d' ' -f2 part, and replace it with awk '{print $2}'; in other words the whole line would look like this nm-tool | grep -i gateway | awk '{print $2}'. Alternatively you could have used nm-tool | grep -oP '(?i)gateway:\\s*\\K\\S+' as proposed by Avinash Raj in the comments. As you can see there is nothing special done here , and the whole ordeal here is merely an exercise in using output editing tools such as cut, awk, and grep.\nAnother method of getting the gateway information is through nmcli dev list (yes, still relying on network manager) command. nmcli is the command - line version of network manager. You could run nmcli dev list | grep -i routers or you could run nmcli dev list | grep -i 'gw =' . Again, you could exercise in in cutting of all the other info except the desired ip address, if you wanted to.\nSince in the original question the only specification was to print the default gateway only, I am relying on output of nm-tool here. NetworkManager comes with Ubuntu by default, this is the standard way for managing Ubuntu's network connections. If you use something other , like wicd or connect through wpa_cli, nm-tool won't provide you an answer. In such case you may find other people's answers bellow more useful.\nA more distro-neutral, and config-neutral option would be to use netstat -n , which uses kernel routing table, similar to route -n. \nIt's output is bellow, nothing surprising.\n  Destination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags Metric Ref    Use Iface\n0.0.0.0         192.168.0.1     0.0.0.0         UG    0      0        0 wlan0\n192.168.0.0     0.0.0.0         255.255.255.0   U     9      0        0 wlan0\n\nAnd here's the way to cut out your desired info : netstat -nr | awk '$1 == \"0.0.0.0\"{print$2}' \nAnother one, neutral as well: arp -n | awk '{print $1}'\n\nA: You can find it many ways\nip route show default\n\nA better question, what or how do you want to shape the output ?\nip route show | awk '/default/ {print $3}'\n\ntracepath -m 1 8.8.8.8 | awk '/1:/ {print $2}' | uniq\n\nFrom the comments -(thank you  Avinash Raj 0\ntracepath -m 1 8.8.8.8 | awk '/1:/ {print $2;exit}'\n\n\nA: I use this one quite often:\nroute -n | awk '{ print $2 }' | grep -Eo '[1-9]{0,3}\\.[1-9]{0,3}\\.[0-9]{0,3}\\.[1-9]{0,3}'\n\n\nA: If you have access to a web browser on the system you can go to http://whatsmyrouterip.com/ and it should be able to find your ip without any command.\nOtherwise simply opening the terminal and doing a ip route | grep default should be enough.

When I try to cd /home I get the error bash: cd: /home: Permission denied\n\nA: As bodhi.zazen says, you should boot to recovery mode and change the permissions back. Recovery mode should still work fine--this change is unlikely to render it unusable--but if for any reason you cannot use recovery mode, you can use a live CD/DVD/USB.\nHold down shift while booting so the GRUB menu is shown. Select Advanced options for Ubuntu, then select the first entry whose name ends in (recovery mode). Then on the recovery menu, select the option labeled:\nroot              Drop to root shell prompt\n\nThis should give you a # root shell prompt. Remount your / filesystem readwrite by running:\nmount -o remount,rw /\n\n(Note that you don't need sudo for that--nor for the chmod commands below--because you are already in a root shell, provided to you by recovery mode.)\nAssuming the only changes you made were to execute permissions, you can then simply run:\nchmod a+x /home\nchmod -R u+X /home/tom\n\n+X sets execute permissions specifically when a file is already executable by some user or a directory (see man chmod for details; note that capital +X is different from +x, which always sets execute permissions). On directories, execute permissions confer the ability to go into the directory. Losing that ability appears to be what has effectively locked you out of your account.\n\n\n*\n\n*Since you just took away executable permissions, there's no need to walk the directory hierarchy with a more complicated find command and identify each file by type to change their permissions. Running chmod recursively with +X will make all the directories \"executable\" (i.e., enterable) by their owner again, which is precisely what you need here. (There's nothing really wrong with a find-based method, such as the one presented in tfmertz's answer--either way will work fine by itself. And if you happened to do both, what's fine too.)\n\n\nThen boot normally, either by running reboot or by running exit (which brings you back to the recovery menu) and selecting the resume option.\nThose chmod commands won't necessarily put things back to exactly what they were before--for that, it would probably be necessary to see what command you ran (but you may be able to find that by running history after logging back in). However, this will likely be sufficient to enable you to log in and use your Ubuntu system normally again.\nThis situation, and the solution, is similar to the more common situation where the sole administrator of a system has lost their password. Thus, while you're changing permissions rather than a password and the solution is not exactly the same, you might find it useful to take a look at How do I reset a lost administrative password? Some of the answers there contain screenshots showing how to get a root shell from recovery mode. And if you are unable to access recovery mode, the instructions there (and in this other question) about accessing your system from a live CD/DVD/USB should help.\n\nA: The /home folder needs to have its execute permission restored\n\n\n*\n\n*Restart Ubuntu\n\n*Run recovery mode in root (Recovery mode how to)\n\n*Run the find commands to restore permissions\n\n\nResetting /home permissions\nRun both the commands below found from z9.io\n\nFor directories only do this\nfind . -type d -exec chmod 775 {} \\;\nFor files only do this.\nfind . -type f -exec chmod 664 {} \\;\n\nRestart Ubuntu in normal mode and try to log in.\n\nA: More than an answer is just a comment about this same issue it happened to me just a few minutes back (Jan 26 2016) where I was completing a lab and I entered a chmod 600 ~ command, so I lost access to my home, so I came to this article, and first tried the find commands and the terminal started reading everything, but it all ended in a permission denied result. \nI went ahead and tried the: \nchmod a+x /home\nchmod -R u+X /home/myname\nand that resolved it immediately. I was able to start entering cd again. \n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 installer insists on running in UEFI mode I am trying to dual boot Windows 7 along side Ubuntu 14.04. I have managed to set this up successfully on my old laptop (which only uses Legacy BIOS) using an installation CD and EasyBCD. However when I go to set it up on my newer laptop it insists on running the Ubuntu installer in EUFI mode.\nThe newer laptop has just had windows 7 installed onto it with the BIOS set to Legacy mode,\nwhen insert the CD and tell the new laptop to boot from that it insists on booting the installer in EUFI mode. (The older laptop was able to run the ubuntu installer fine in Legacy mode.)\nIf I understand correctly both OS need to be installed in the same mode. My preference would be to use legacy mode as this is the default setting for my laptop and will work with EasyBCD. \nI tried installing windows 7 in EUFI mode but the installer couldn't boot properly.\nIs it possible to force my laptop to boot the installer using Legacy mode?\n\nA: How to get your laptop to boot the cd in bios mode is specific to your model of laptop: you will have to read the manual or contact the manufacturer about that.  However, when installing Ubuntu along side an existing bios booting Windows install, it will automatically stick with bios booting even though the installer itself is booted in UEFI mode.\n", "Q: ip netns monitor not working in a script I'm trying to use ip netns monitor in a script to react to the creation of new network namespaces, eg:\nip netns monitor | while read ACTION NETNS; do\n echo 'handling it!'\ndone\n\nHowever I never see any output from ip netns monitor in this use case. Further experimenting reveals I never see any output from ip netns monitor if it is redirected or piped.\nHere is a simple example of what does give the expected result:\n$ ip netns monitor &\n$ touch /var/run/netns/dummy ; sleep 2 ; rm /var/run/netns/dummy\nadd dummy\ndelete dummy\n\nAnd here is another example of a usage that produces zero output:\n$ ip netns monitor >/tmp/ip-netns-monitor.log 2>&1 &\n$ ip netns monitor | cat &\n$ touch /var/run/netns/dummy ; sleep 2 ; rm /var/run/netns/dummy\n$ cat /tmp/ip-netns-monitor.log\n# no results\n\nI have tracked my version of ip back to this implementation of monitor:\nhttp://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/shemminger/iproute2.git/tree/ip/ipnetns.c?id=3c61c01a666d9f4dbb871305ab6791e19ede7d4a#n462\nI don't see anything obvious in the source that would cause behaviour to change based on where STDOUT is pointed - but I'm still new to all this.\nIs there some way I should be using ip netns monitor so that it works in a script? Or should I be raising a bug somewhere?\nIf this is truly broken I can try a workaround with inotifywait instead.\nMy system:\n$ ip -Version\nip utility, iproute2-ss131122\n$ lsb_release --description\nDescription:    Ubuntu 14.04.2 LTS\n$ uname -rvm\n3.13.0-45-generic #74-Ubuntu SMP Tue Jan 13 19:36:28 UTC 2015 x86_64\n\n\nUpdate\nI have run both interactive and redirected variants with strace and the results follow.\nMethod:\nwhile true; do touch /var/run/netns/dummy ; sleep 2; rm /var/run/netns/dummy; sleep 2; done &\nstrace -ivy ip netns monitor\nstrace -ivy ip netns monitor | cat\n\nAside from some addresses and handles, strace shows the same initialisation for both.

The results of read show that the notifications are coming through as expected. And ip netns monitor must be happy there is no error because it keeps looping.\n\nA: I'm taking a guess that this is possibly you hitting an issue where stdout on a pipe buffers at 4K. See https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/25378 for some ideas on fixing it. To confirm this is your specific issue, try changing the name of your dummy file to something much larger, or call touch/rm multiple times, to generate enough output to hit the default buffer size.\n", "Q: 14.04 w/ Intel HD 4000 display crashes when changing resolution So, I just upgraded to Ubuntu 14.04 over spring break because MATE seems to have gotten to a point that it is generally usable with Compiz for me. I did a minimal install, and put MATE on top of that, and everything was working fine. This is on a System76 gazp7, so only the Intel HD 4000 Graphics (no dual-graphics setup like the questions I keep finding when I search), native resolution 1920×1080.\nI know that at the beginning of this week I was able to connect my television just fine over HDMI, but now when I try to change the resolution (either activating a second display, or even with just the built in display changing resolution) the screen(s) start to flicker and everything becomes unresponsive.\nWhen I kill the display with Ctrl + Alt + Backspace I am able to regain control of everything, but this leaves me with only one display again. I have been trying to dig through everything I installed in the past week to find anything that looks display-related, but I can not find much. I tried getting the xorg-edgers PPA but it not only failed to fix my issue, it also broke window decorations.\nWhen I launch Red Eclipse (game), my screen changes to 1360×768 and back just fine, no flickering or failing to update or losing responsiveness. I am not sure why that works, but since it involves changing the resolution and it works I thought I would add that.\nIs anyone aware of what might cause this, or does anyone have ideas on where I can poke to try to get better information about why this is happening?\n\nA: For compiz flickering, install compiz-config-settings-manager:\nsudo apt-get install compiz-config-settings-manager\n\nto run:\nccsm &\n\nThen, click on open-gl and set texture filter to fast and set the same as shown here (lighting off, sync to vblank on, texture compression off, framebuffer, vertex and always use buffer swapping all on.\n\nNext, click on composite, disable slow animations, enable detect refresh rate, set refresh rate to ac freq, and force independent you can experiment with.\n\nNow, disable copy to texture and maybe disable all animations unless you actually want any of those.\nFinally, with mate, I believe you should have the mate plugin enabled as well.\nFor window decorations, enable the window decoration plugin.\n", "Q: Identifying syslog files, also does auth.log mirror what is in /vars/syslog? I am writing a auth log parser as a means to contribute to a tool and to learn linux logging better.  I have been reading up on syslog and log facilities and was wondering if what is in auth.log will also be duplicated in syslog.log?  Does it just make sense to only parse syslog and not other facility specific log files, assuming I want as much as I can get anyways? I guess what I am asking is there ever a time that there will be a unique log instance found in auth.log that will not also be included in syslog?\nin addition, when looking at a log file such as auth.log. is there a sure way of telling what facility is being used other just the log name and path. Just thinking of terms of log identification when dealing with moved, renamed or deleted log files.\n\nA: Read man rsyslog.conf, and inspect /etc/rsyslog.conf, /etc/rsyslog.d/*. In /etc/rsyslog.d/50-default.conf you will see:  \n# First some standard log files.

If the .ssh directory is missing (which seems normal if not previously configured) you can create it and also the authorized_keys file within and then populate the file's contents with your public key.\n\nA: The %h placeholder can have one of two (unrelated) meanings, depending on where it is used in configuration for sshd (deamon/server)  or ssh (client).\nThe man page for sshd_config(5) documents %h as the file path to your home directory, and is accepted by multiple keywords relating to files and directories:\n\nTOKENS\nArguments to some keywords can make use of tokens, which are expanded at runtime:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*[..]\n  \n*%h - The home directory of the user.\n  \n*[..]\n  \n  \n  AuthorizedKeysCommand accepts the tokens %%, %f, %h, %k, %t, %U, and %u.\nAuthorizedKeysFile accepts the tokens %%, %h, %U, and %u.\nAuthorizedPrincipalsCommand accepts the tokens %%, %F, %f, %h, %i, %K, %k, %s, %T, %t, %U, and %u.\nAuthorizedPrincipalsFile accepts the tokens %%, %h, %U, and %u.\nChrootDirectory accepts the tokens %%, %h, %U, and %u.\n\nThe man page for ssh_config(5) documents %h as the specified hostname in the ssh command.\n\nTOKENS\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*%h - The remote hostname.\n  \n  \n  [..]\nHostName accepts the tokens %% and %h.\n\nThis is commonly used to create shortcuts on the command-line.

While this partition table format is a much needed improvement over the BIOS-MBR partition table and firmware scheme, it still has compatibility issues with some OSes and hardware - especially older hardware. Older hardware don't have support for UEFI and by extension GPT - which is the only partition table that Windows 8 can be installed on.

I even went ahead and installed ubuntu-gnome-desktop after gnome-shell installed with no issues. \nWhile you are at it, you can install synaptic, if not already installed, to see if there are any broken packages that need to be fixed. Synaptic has a tool to fix broken package if they do exist. Click on \"fix broken packages\" from one of the dropdown menus and then click \"apply\". Although, it doesn't appear this is the problem because you don't have the correct dependencies so you should already get that error but if need be.\nAlso, there may be issues setting your network preferences from gnome-shell (all the newer versions of gnome-shell are lacking in this area anyhow imo)\n\nA: Instead of installing through apt-get, you can also download Ubuntu GNOME desktop OS for free from their website : http://ubuntugnome.org/download/\nOr, if you just want the Stand alone Gnome desktop without ubuntu, then you can simply go to www.gnome.org and Download GNOME 3.16 the latest version os for free. \nPersonally, I prefer to download and install this GNOME 3 OS instead of trying to install GNOME 3 as a side environment because, currently, Gnome 3.16 is not available (3.10 or 3.12 is available through apt-get).\n            Download GNOME 3.16 OS now\n", "Q: is there any way to change ssh or vnc config using ftp?

It is a whirring sound, so I would like to think it's the fan, but running sensors, even when it reports 0rpm for the fan, I hear this noise. While it isn't incredibly loud, it is noticeable, especially when the computer isn't making any other noise, e.g. music.

However, I'll entertain the notion it is your hard drive, and help you to determine if it is actually failing or has something to do with your Ubuntu installation.\nPlease open your Disk Utility and, provided SMART is supported, use that to determine if your hard drive is healthy.\nNext open your System Settings, and then open the icon there marked, \"Details\" to determine how much RAM your system has.  The reason I request you do that is that the most common cause of noisy hard drives, apart of course from impending failure, is inadequate RAM.  If your hard drive has less than 2gb of RAM, I recommend upgrading it to a minimum of 2gb if you can afford to do so.\n", "Q: STEAM games crashes on LENOVO Z50 70 with DUAL GRAPHICS (intel+nvidia) Problem\nLot of steam games doesnt work at all on my notebook or simply crashes.

Now all steam games I have work perfecly (inc. performance-intensive War for Overworld). Thank you again.\nsudo apt-get install bumblebee-nvidia\n\n\nA: In my personal 20 years experience setting up gaming computers for fun and sometimes profit, I've setup a few \"gaming laptops\", and recurrently learned the same lesson;  Laptop/notbook PCs tend to have overheating problems when their graphics chipsets are pushed to their limits.  \nOne of the features of STEAM is the efforts the operators go to to help ensure STEAM users are advised of any drivers that might extract better performance out of the graphics chips.  However, pushing chips harder also makes them run hotter.\nSo, if you are experiencing instability issues while running steam, the problem could well be related to overheating.  I have a couple of recommendations:\n\n\n*\n\n*Backflush your heatsink:\nYou can do this with compressed air, canned air, or my personal favorite, your own breath.  With the notebook turned off and closed, simply place your mouth over the exhaust port such that your lips seal around the edges and blow hard and fast, like you are trying to disturb the hair of an annoying co-worker six feet away.\n\n*Use a more effective cooling stand:\nThis is assuming you are using a cooling stand.  If you are not using a cooling stand... there's your answer and so anything is better than nothing.  Having purchased many for my associates over the years, one of my favorite cooling stands is also among the least expensive, and still available on Amazon.\n\n", "Q: Free text editor with comment/uncomment shortcuts I really like Sublime Text, but since I use the free version, the popups are annoying me.\nWhat I liked about it really was the comment/uncomment shortcut key independent of the file type.\nIs there any good editor out there with these shortcuts independent of file type (cpp,py,etc). \n\nA: you can use a ide called geany, for installing it type\nsudo apt-get install geany\n\nand after go to the edit menu and then go to keybindings menu and from there set\nkeyword for commenting and uncommenting the code, and then press code combination in the code it will work,\n", "Q: Uninstalling mcafee antivirus I am using Ubuntu 14.04.

Today I completely removed VMWare player \nsudo vmware-installer -u vmware-player\n\nand downloaded the latest 7.1.2 bundle from https://my.vmware.com/web/vmware/free#desktop_end_user_computing/vmware_player/7_0 selecting Minor version 7.1.2 (latest)\nsh VMware-Player-7.1.2-2780323.x86_64.bundle\n\nInstalled and working fine, I am now able to access the VM I was working on prior to upgrading ubuntu to 15.04.\n\nA: http://rglinuxtech.com/?p=1281 This is the source information that the archlinux patch came from. There's also an issue with netif.c now that causes a failure and requires a separate edit to fix before retarring up the vmnet.tar file.\nI'm hoping/assuming that vmware will just come out with a bug fix release in the next few days so people don't have to jump through these hoops.\n", "Q: Recover encrypted home folder after reinstallation Yesterday I did a fresh installation of Ubuntu 14.10 over Ubuntu 14.04 and now I am not able to decrypt my home folder.

I get following error: \nsignature not found in user keyring perhaps try the interactive 'ecryptfs-mount-private'.\nWhen I try ecryptfs-mount-private command, it tells me that my login passphrase is wrong. I am using my password as my login passphrase. I haven't changed my password for a long long time, and my current password is same as my old password. So I am not sure why it is not working. When I try ecryptfs-verify -p command, it tells me that the configuration is invalid with error: \nERROR: Mount point [/home/$USER] is user's home\nERROR: Configuration invalid\n\nWhile ecryptfs-verify -h doesn't give any error. What am I doing wrong?\nI did save my mount passphrase as well but when I try to use it from live usb using ecryptfs-recover-private, I get success but the mounted directory is still encrypted.\n\nA: I was finally able to decrypt my home folder and recover my data.

And it turns out that the mount passphrase I had saved was not the same as the one wrapped in wrapped-passphrase file! And now that I look into it, the wrapped-passphrase file was changed just last month although I have been using the same login password for years! Anyway...\n\n\n*Now that I have correct mount passphrase, to decrypt and mount my home folder, I just followed the steps listed in this answer: https://askubuntu.com/a/36783/271868\n\nA: Test this:\nSwitch on your computer.\nPress and hold the Shift key.\nIn the Grub menu select the line which starts with ---- Advanced options.\nSelect the line ending with --- recovery mode.\nYour PC should display a menu with a number of options, select --- Drop to root shell prompt. \nIn a terminal run:\nmount -o remount,rw /\nmount --all\nmount -t ecryptfs /home/user_name/.Private /home/user_name/Private\n\nYour data encrypted in /home/user-name/.Private should be decrypted and mounting to /home/user_name/Private\n", "Q: Start gnome-terminal with predefined history I would like to start a Gnome terminal window with a predefined history file.\nI tried:\ngnome-terminal -e 'bash -c \"history -c; history -r ~/test.hist; exec bash\"'\n\nbut it still uses the standard history file: ~/.bash_history..\n\nA: The history file is set using the HISTFILE variable.

Please can someone try help this non ubuntu user to fix my problems . Thank you\n\nA: My advice to you would be to make absolutely certain your installation is fully updated.  As I am not a mint user, I'm not sure how to advise you, but if it is anything like Ubuntu, it should be as easy as pressing the windows key on your keyboard, typing UPDATE, pressing enter, and then pressing on the CHECK button, prior to pressing on the UPDATE button.\nMay I ask why you chose MINT over Ubuntu?\n", "Q: Ubuntu + Windows Fails I want to put windows and Ubuntu together in one pc (seems possible xD).\nI reduce my hard drive to 150GB and install Ubuntu 14.04 on that.

I have checked my hard disk to the cluster error and also defragmented. It is not on the hard disk and the CD-ROM drive that burns the CD it is also not, because I have also used other CD burner with the same problem.\nHow can I solve it?\n\nA: I've discovered through trial and error that though probably greater than 80% of PCs are Linux compatible, a disturbing percentage simply are not.  This is why when asked for advice I always advise putting a PC through its paces either with an Ubuntu boot CD/DVD, or alternately a Ubuntu boot flash drive.  I prefer the latter for reasons explained in my bio here.  \nIn any case though I'm not saying your computer simply will not work with Ubuntu, there may be a fix, you should accept the possibility that either it isn't compatible or that the solution may be prohibitively complicated.  \nPlease update your query with a few stats about the computer, particularly the brand and model number so that others can attempt to determine if it is one of the troubled ones.\n", "Q: Is there a way I can zoom in gala window manager?

How can I configure these tools to achieve what I want?\n\nA: Here you can find information about how to make a cronjob. Make one with the timing you want and this command:\n/usr/bin/update-manager\n\nThis will open the graphic update manager which then searches for updates.\nIf you like graphical applications, you can just install a graphical cronjob manager with this command:\nsudo apt-get install gnome-schedule\n\nIts called \"Scheduled tasks\" in the dash.

Is it possible to use Android apps in Ubuntu? This question was allready asked and answered before but now we are over 4 years later. Is the situation unchanged?\n\nA: How to Run Android Apps on Linux\nTo run Android apps on Linux through Chrome you will need, obviously, to install Chrome. Version 37 or higher is required. Honestly, if you’re going to be playing with a potentially unstable hack then you might as well download and install the unstable version of Google Chrome for Linux, too.\nAdding the Chrome PPA. Already got a version of Chrome installed? Skip this step:\nwget -q -O - https://dl-ssl.google.com/linux/linux_signing_key.pub | sudo apt-key add -\nsudo sh -c 'echo \"deb http://dl.google.com/linux/chrome/deb/ stable main\" >> /etc/apt/sources.list.d/google.list'\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install google-chrome-unstable\n\nYou can install the Dev Channel version via the command line by running:\nsudo apt-get install google-chrome-unstable\n\nNext you need to download the custom-made -ergo officially not endorsed by Google or Chromium- Android Runtime created by Vlad Filippov. This differs from the official version in a number of ways, the chief being it can be used on desktop versions of the browser.\nDownload ARChon v1.1 (for 32bit Chrome) from GitHub\nDownload ARChon v1.1 (for 64bit Chrome) from GitHub \nOnce the runtime has fully downloaded you will need to extract the contents from the .zip files and move the resulting directory to your home folder. \nNow to install ARChon. Open Google Chrome and click the hamburger menu. Navigate through to the Tools > Extensions page and, near the top, check Enable developer mode.\nFinally, click on the load unpacked extension button and select the folder you previously placed into your home folder. \nThe Runtime alone doesn’t do much by itself so you will need to create a compatible package from an Android app.\nRunning apps\nThere are some methods to do this:\nRunning a downloaded APK:\n\n\n*\n\n*Automatic method:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install Twerk from here into Chrome\n\n*Drag and drop an Android .apk file from your desktop into the main Twerk window.\n\n*Enter an app name, choose an icon from your hard drive and set your preferences for how the app should run (portrait mode, tablet mode, etc.) using the sliders.\n\n*Tap the pink Android button and a neat, runtime-ready bundle is spat out at the other end, ready to be installed as an unpacked extension.\n\n*The settings on offer are suitably comprehensive too, letting you:\n\n\n*\n\n*Set custom name and icon\n\n*Package for ‘Archon’ or official runtime\n\n*Set tablet or mobile layout\n\n*Set landscape or portrait mode\n\n*Toggle scaling (may prevent some apps working)\n\n*Toggle SD Card support\n\n*Set offline functionality\n\n\n\n*Manual method (Not recommended): \nTo convert APKs manually -something you really don’t need to do any more if you use one of the apps mentioned above- you will need to install the chromeos-apk command line JavaScript utility. This is available to install through the Node Packaged Modules (npm) manager.\n\n\n*\n\n*Install Node:\nsudo apt-get install npm nodejs nodejs-legacy\n\n\n*Ubuntu 64 user? You’ll want to grab the following library, too:\nsudo apt-get install lib32stdc++6\n\n\n*run the command to install the script itself:\nnpm install -g chromeos-apk\n\n\n*Depending on your configuration you may need to need to run this latter command as root. If you’d prefer not to install npm modules with sudo, you can do so with some jiggery-pokery.\nNow you’re in the home straight. Head over to Google to find an APK of an app you want to try out, bearing in mind not all Android apps will work, and those that do may be unstable or lack features.\n\n\n*\n\n*Place your wanted Android APK in your home folder, then return to Terminal to convert it using the following command, replacing the APK name with the one you want:\nchromeos-apk replaceme.apk --archon\n\n\n*The command will take a few seconds to do its thing. Maybe have a blink. Actually, don’t blink. \nYou now have an ARChon-rocking Chrome APK extension-y folder-y thing waiting in your home folder. All that’s left to do is install it to see if it works!\n\n\n*\n\n*Head back into the chrome://extensions page, tap the ‘load unpacked extension’ button once again but this time select the folder the script above created.\n\n\nThe app should proceed to install without issue, but will it run without issue? Open the Chrome App Launcher or Apps Page and launch it to find out.\nExporting apps from your android device\nYou can export the apps already installed in your Android device with this method.\n\n\n*\n\n*Install this app from google play.\n\n*On first launch you’ll see an overview of what the application intends to do. Tap next and you’ll be presented with two options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Select an installed app\n\n*Select an APK you have downloaded\n\n\n\nSelect the first option in the list\n* Tap Next and choose something from the list of apps already installed on your device.\n\n\n*\n\n*The utility will ‘pull’ the package it needs from what is already on your phone.\n\n*Set your preferences\n\n*On to the next screen where you can set device and orientation mode for the app as it will be on Chrome. Think about how you use the app and how you would prefer to use it on the desktop.\n\n*While ‘tablet’ and ‘landscape’ modes will be the optimum experience for most, choose what suits your needs.\n\n*After packaging is complete you need to transfer the resulting zip archive(s) from your phone or tablet (in the ‘Chrome APKs’ folder) to your PC or Chromebook.\n\n*How you go about this is up to you, but for small files you could use Google Drive, Dropbox or a similar cloud syncing service.\n\n*Once you have the archive(s) ready on your desktop, laptop or Chromebook you will need extract them and move the resulting folder(s) somewhere safe.\n\n*To install them open Google Chrome and head to the ‘extensions’ page. Check the ‘Developer Mode’ box near the top of the page to reveal the ‘Load Unpacked Extension’ button. Click this, select the extracted folder from the previous step and the app will install.\nFinally, launch it to see if it runs!\n\nSource 1: http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2014/09/install-android-apps-ubuntu-archon\nSource 2: http://www.omgchrome.com/twerk-chrome-archon-apk-maker-desktop/ \n", "Q: Can't dual-boot Windows 7 after installing Ubuntu After having some compatibility issues with some software on Ubuntu, I decided I should dual boot windows 7 so I can use that software. After booting from an Ubuntu live CD and partitioning off 100GB of my Ubuntu hard drive, I got this message from the windows 7 live cd when trying to install onto the blank partition:\n\nWindows cannot be installed to this disk. The selected disk is of the GPT partition style\n\nAfter doing some research, the only solutions I could find involve formatting the whole hard drive, which I can't do because I want to keep Ubuntu, and I have no where to put a 400GB backup\nResult of sudo parted -l:\nModel: ATA ST1000DM003-1ER1 (scsi)\nDisk /dev/sda: 1000GB\nSector size (logical/physical): 512B/4096B\nPartition Table: gpt\n\nNumber  Start   End     Size    File system     Name                  Flags\n 1      1049kB  538MB   537MB   fat32                                 boot\n 2      538MB   884GB   884GB   ext4\n 3      884GB   992GB   107GB                   Basic data partition  msftdata\n 4      992GB   1000GB  8468MB  linux-swap(v1)\n\n(Number 3 is the partition I want to install to, so the reason it has no file system is because I deleted the partition while using my windows installation disk)\n\nA: This is really a Windows issue, not an Ubuntu issue, but it does interact with Ubuntu, so it merits an answer.\nYour first task is to figure out your Ubuntu boot mode. If the directory /sys/firmware/efi is present, you're booting Ubuntu in EFI mode. This is the best possibility for overcoming your problem. If that directory is not present, then you're almost certainly booting in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode, which could complicate matters. I'll take the simpler case first.\nIf you're booting Ubuntu in EFI mode, then the solution is to get the Windows installer to boot in EFI mode, too. I just did a Web search and found this forum post on the subject. I can't promise it's 100% accurate. If you have problems, try a Web search of your own or ask on a Windows forum.\nIf you're booting Ubuntu in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode, then you need to figure out if your computer is capable of EFI-mode booting. If it is, you can install Windows in EFI mode and then install an EFI boot loader for Linux (see below), thus getting both Windows and Linux booting in EFI mode. If the computer is BIOS-only, then you're faced with the need for more complex or ugly workarounds, such as:\n\n\n*\n\n*Run Windows in a virtualized environment (such as under VirtualBox).\n\n*Convert the disk from GPT to MBR form (which you can do with gdisk, with some caveats), then install Windows in a conventional dual-boot configuration.\n\n*Create Windows partitions and then create a hybrid MBR that contains those partitions to keep Windows happy.\n\n\nI've listed these options in more-or-less the order I recommend them, although details of your configuration and needs might change that order.\nNote that when you install Windows, in any boot mode, it's likely to either partially overwrite GRUB or configure its own boot loader as the primary one. (Using VirtualBox is the only solution that will eliminate this risk.) Thus, I wouldn't invest much effort in making Ubuntu boot loader changes before installing Windows. The Boot Repair utility can fix many Ubuntu boot problems; but it's important that you boot the emergency disk that you use to run it in the same mode you use for booting your OSes (BIOS/CSM/legacy vs. EFI/UEFI). To control this boot mode, you may need to use your firmware's boot manager, and details of how to do that vary from one computer to another.\nAnother boot loader repair option, albeit only for EFI-mode boots, is to use my rEFInd boot manager. You can download the CD-R or USB flash drive version, boot from it, and boot into Ubuntu in EFI mode. You can then install rEFInd from its Debian package or PPA; or run Boot Repair and be confident you're doing it in EFI mode.\n", "Q: Installation with wine error I downloaded vds 6.0 (a script type programming language for windows OS's) and now I am trying to install it in ubuntu 14.04. I looked at wine app database and I found that vds 6 works on wine. Here have a look at it https://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=version&iId=13983. It is gold rated!! \nBut I am unable to run it. When I right click on it and open with wine, nothing occurs. The arrow gets busy for sometime and then resets. Then I did so from the terminal.\n\nrehanullahafridi@rehanullahafridi:~/.wine/dosdevices/c:/visual-dialogscript-60[R1PP3R]$ wine start setup.exe\n\nSetup.exe is the vds(visual dialog script) setup file.\nAnd the result was:\n\nfixme:exec:SHELL_execute flags ignored: 0x00000100\n\nJust this nothing more is displayed. I googled around google but all in vain. Please help me going with this. Much thanks in anticipation.\n\nA: Since the \"gold\" result linked indicates only that the demo was tested and runnable under a very old version of both wine and Ubuntu, what I would do is install virtualbox under Ubuntu, install a supported version of Windows on a virtual machine and then install vds 6.0 on the VM. this approach will virtually guarantee compatibility (I've been forced to do the same with Windows software in the past with good results). If anything is unclear drop me a comment and I'll do my best to clarify.\n\nA: Open \"Configure Wine\" from the dash and try different versions of Windows. It often helps.\n", "Q: Is it really possible to properly create a bootable USB of Ubuntu from Windows? I was trying to create a bootable USB of Ubuntu from Ubuntu when some symbolic links errors appeared, which I explained in this question. There was no valid answer what these errors are, nor are they significant. It is possible to bypass them using  Disk image writer  which came preinstalled in Ubuntu. However, symbolic links are not compatible with FAT32 filesystem and the reason why Disk image writer can bypass these is because (I believe) it rearrange filesystem on USB.\n\nNow, I don't think there is a single tool for Windows that can do this rearrange, so this links are not included in a bootable USB. Hence the question: \nIs it really possible to properly create a bootable USB of Ubuntu from Windows?\n\nA: You cannot make the links but you can simply copy the content from the link target to the location of the link.

But that was of little help.\nAlso I dont see any options for enabling/disabling scroll  which are usually there in the muose/touchpad settings.\n\nPlease suggest a working solution.\n\nA: VMWare Workstation currently doesn't have native support for two finger scroll. You can switch to VirtualBox or install a third-party software on your host that emulates a scroll wheel.\n\nA: The best bet would be to use the arrow keys to work around the touchpad, it is incredibly frustrating but I am beginning to recognize that there is no fix for this.\n", "Q: Why Landscape is not showing package information?

I don't want the system to swap, neither to a swap partition nor to a swap file. \n\n\nIn my usage habits I would consider any process that causes full RAM as harmful and would prefer the process to be automatically killed rather than that swapping is necessary. \n\n\n*Is there a way to disable swapping completely (not just reduce swappiness) and force the Kernel to kill processes that take eg. 50% of RAM?\n\n\nA: Note that ps (on my Ubuntu 14.04.2) shows \"kswapd\" as:  \nroot        39     2  0 Mar23 ?        00:03:27 [kswapd0]  \n\nThe \"[]\" surrounding the process name indicates that kswapd0 is a portion of the kernel code that, for system convenience, is running as a process.  \nkswapd not only manages swapping, it also manages the flow of memory among buffers, cache, available, etc.  \nHaving NO swap space will prevent swapping. Without swapping, when a RAM hog allocates all the memory, the next process to request RAM (hog or not) will get an OOM (Out Of Memory) error and be stopped. Note that it is not necessarily the memory hog that will be killed, just the first process to request RAM when there is none (or there are no memory blocks bigger than the request)\n", "Q: How to add my other hard drives to ubuntu on vmware I have Windows 8.1 as my main OS and can't change it because of homegroup for my family.

How to understand the Ubuntu file system layout?\n\n*/dev/sda2 is an extended partition - which means you are using an MBR partition table instead of GPT. The Ubuntu installer usually sets up one extended partition to contain the swap partition, to avoid accidentally using up four primary partitions (the limit on MBR partition tables). What does the term \"Extended Partition\" mean? Is it safe to use this type of partition?\n\n*/dev/sda5 is used for swap, the Linux variant of the paging file from Windows. See the Swap FAQ.\n\n\nThe only partition you should expect to see is the root partition, since swap isn't for direct usage. It will look something like this:\n\nAs for re-paritioning, note the key icons next to all the partitions - they can't be modified. And that's because they're all in use. To modify them, you'd have to boot to a live CD, so that they're not in use. See Why I'm seeing a lock besides the partition I'm trying to modify with gparted? or How to resize partitions?\n\nA: Muru's answer is correct; however, there's another issue implicit in your question: Why do you want to create partitions?\nLinux and Windows use partitions in very different ways. Windows users often create separate partitions to hold the OS, user-installed programs, user data files, and perhaps for other reasons. Under Linux, OTOH, separate partitions are often created to hold swap space, kernels, user data files, temporary files, and for other reasons. The list of reasons to create partitions in each OS is not identical, although there is some overlap. If you're coming at Linux from a Windows background and try to apply typical Windows partitioning strategies, you'll end up with something sub-optimal at best, or dig yourself into a hole at worst.\nMy own recommendation for new Linux users is to keep it simple. Create three partitions for Linux:\n\n\n*\n\n*root (/) -- This partition is required and, in the absence of other partitions, holds everything. An Ubuntu installation can be done in under 10 GiB of space, although to give yourself the room to install lots of stuff, 20-30 GiB might be a good size for this partition.\n\n*swap -- This partition is used as an adjunct to memory. Make it a little larger than your computer's RAM so that you can use a suspend-to-disk feature if you so desire.\n\n*/home -- This is where user files go in Linux. Creating a separate /home partition enables you to do a clean re-install without touching your user files. Devote the rest of your disk space to /home so you can store big user files (multimedia files, for instance).\n\n\nBy default, Ubuntu creates the first two of those partitions but does not create a separate /home partition. In some cases, you may need to create other partitions. A separate /boot partition holds kernels and is a practical necessity if you're using LVM or some types of RAID setups, for instance. Advanced users might create partitions for /var, /tmp, /usr, or other purposes. In most cases, though, the three I've outlined in the bulleted list are adequate.\nI see a lot of new Linux users recommending the use of a separate data partition (/data or something similar). This is Windows thinking that's re-inventing the wheel -- \"the wheel\" in this case being the /home partition. There are very few cases where it makes sense to create a separate data partition from /home. The most common of these is when dual-booting -- in that case, a separate partition to hold shared data may make sense. New Linux users also sometimes ask about creating a partition to hold user-installed programs separate from the OS. Given the way Linux stores programs and packages, this makes little sense, unless perhaps you want a separate /usr/local partition to hold locally-compiled programs -- but few users would really use such a partition.\nNote also that any Linux partition can be either primary or logical. (Extended partitions are merely placeholders for all your logical partitions. They don't really count, although you have to create one if you want to use logical partitions.)\n\nA: *\n\n*Boot a live system.\n\n*Open GParted.\n\n*Delete sda5.\n\n*Delete sda2.\n\n*Resize sda1 from the right to the left.\n\n*Create a new extended partition taking in all of the remaining space.\n\n*Create a new swap partition.\n\n*Create the other partitions you want.\n\n*Boot into your installed system.\n\n*Open GParted.\n\n*Right-click on your swap partition and choose \"swapon\".\n\n*Right-click it again and choose \"Information\".\n\n*Copy the UUID to the clipboard.\n\n*Update the swap line in /etc/fstab.\n\n\nNotice that you should back up your data since changing something on your partitions comes with a risk of data loss, especially in case of a power failure.\n\nA: In screenshot \n\nPrimary partition\n\nHere only one primary partition is available but normal system support max 4 primary partitions but afterward no partition can made thats why we make one partition secondary (extended)  1.

Well, it got worse actually.\nI headed over to http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1435818 where I found that one liner:  \ndpkg --get-selections | grep 'linux-image*' | awk '{print $1}' | egrep -v \"linux-image-$(uname -r) | linux-image-generic\" | while read n; do apt-get -y remove $n; done\n\nObviously I did not understand exactly what it was going to do although I was pretty confident. It did quite a few uninstalls for a while, I did not remember having seen that before. After executing it, I checked and my /boot partition only had the latest kernel, in my case 3.16.0-31-generic, which is what I expected. But upon reboot, gone was my high resolution graphical settings (this could be because of the nvidia drivers, that would not be the first time) and also gone was the mouse, and also the network. Luckily I use a ps2 keyboard and this is still working. I suspect some modules are missing although lsmod still lists quite a few. \nHow could I diagnose the exact problem, and if indeed I need to reinstall the kernel how can I do that with my network gone? Or how can I load the module to get network back if this is the issue?\n\nA: Thanks for the comments about looking at the logs to see what was removed. It showed the previous kernels were removed indeed, and also the extra package for the current kernel. I still needed to reinstall a current kernel. So I booted from a USB live distro, mounted the encrypted partition where the home folder was, downloaded the latest kernel for this version along with extras, copied the 2 .deb on the local drive, rebooted and issued a dpkg -i on the debs. It installed everything, I rebooted and it's all back to normal.\n", "Q: Lookup DNS-names outside domain how do I configure my DNS server so users can lookup the DNS names outside my domain Linux1.ok?\nthis should be done recursively.\nthanks\n\nA: Here's sample /etc/dhcpd.conf from https://help.ubuntu.com/community/dhcp3-server\n# Sample /etc/dhcpd.conf\n# (add your comments here) \ndefault-lease-time 600;\nmax-lease-time 7200;\noption subnet-mask 255.255.255.0;\noption broadcast-address 192.168.1.255;\noption routers 192.168.1.254;\noption domain-name-servers 192.168.1.1, 192.168.1.2;\noption domain-name \"mydomain.example\";\n\nsubnet 192.168.1.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {\nrange 192.168.1.10 192.168.1.100;\nrange 192.168.1.150 192.168.1.200;\n}\n\nNotice the line option domain-name-servers 192.168.1.1, 192.168.1.2; You could add there dns servers outside your domain that you want\n", "Q: How can I create a LiveCD in <= 1G? I have a 1G USB key, and CDs (which are 700M).\nMost of the instructions for Ubuntu say get a 2G stick.  Many links to a USB key that is smaller are old, and point back to the Ubuntu site, which now says 2G USB key.\nWhat are up to date instructions to make a smaller LiveCD to run?\n\nA: I agree with Bodhi, that you can create bootable USB media that fit only slightly more data than the size of the original ISO image. I ran Ubuntu 12.04 (~800 MB) as a live system and installed it off a 1 GiB USB drive without any issues.\nAlternatively, you can use a Minimal CD image or create your own Ubuntu remix.\n", "Q: Why can't I boot into Ubuntu after installing and then erasing Fedora? Original Question\nI'm trying to install Xubuntu on a 2015 Dell XPS 13 laptop, but I've been running into all sorts of bootloader-related problems. To make a long story short, I've installed several different distros on this machine over the past few weeks, but the trouble didn't begin until after I installed Fedora 21. Here's a quick summary of events:\n\n\n*\n\n*I originally installed Xubuntu 14.10 and 15.04 Beta 1 alongside Windows 8 without any problems.\n\n*I erased the entire disk and installed Fedora 21 using LVM with encryption and the default partitioning scheme.\n\n*I've attempted numerous times to erase the entire disk and install Xubuntu 14.10 and Xubuntu 15.04 Beta 1 using various partitioning schemes. Sometimes I get an error message stating that GRUB installation failed. At other times, the installation completes without error, but when I reboot my machine, Ubuntu is not detected as a boot option. Unfortunately I don't have any error logs available from the times when the GRUB installation failed, and I haven't been able to reproduce that specific problem recently.\n\n*I tried erasing the disk and installing Fedora 21 again, and the installation completed successfully. I could boot into Fedora without error.\n\n*I again attempted to erase the disk and install Xubuntu and Ubuntu 14.10, but I encountered the same problems as before: the installation completes successfully, but there are no entries in the Dell boot menu.\n\n\nI'm using UEFI with Secure Boot disabled for all of this. All I want to do is to erase the disk and perform a standard installation of Ubuntu or Xubuntu with no other operatinng systems installed. \nCurrently I have Xubuntu 14.10 (and no other OS) installed, but it's not showing up in the boot options when I turn on my machine. I've tried running boot-repair, and it's giving me this message:\n\nGPT detected. Please create a BIOS-Boot partition (>1MB, unformatted filesystem, bios_grub flag). This can be performed via tools such as Gparted. Then try again.\n\nI'm confused by this, because I'm booted using UEFI. (/sys/firmware/efi is present.)\nI realize that this is not a lot of information to go on, but I'd be extremely grateful if anyone could point me in the right direction or suggest what might be causing this problem.\nBackground\nIn case it's relevant, I'm running the Dell A03 BIOS on this machine. I replaced the stock Broadcom wireless card with an Intel 7260NGW while Fedora was installed in order to get better out-of-the-box networking support without messing with proprietary drivers. That hasn't caused any obvious problems.\nEverything described here was done in UEFI mode with Secure Boot disabled using 64-bit ISOs.\nI've tried creating installation media using both Startup Disk Creator and dd and encountered problems in both cases.\nI've been jumping between distros in an effort to find something with a relatively recent kernel that plays nicely with this machine. I've been trying to install Xubuntu 15.04 Beta 1 rather than Beta 2 in order to avoid this bug.\nSummary, Speculation, and Questions\nI've tentatively ruled out the following possible explanations (but feel free to correct me if I'm mistaken here):\n\n\n*\n\n*Bad USB drive\n\n*Improperly created installation medium\n\n*Booted in wrong mode\n\n\nIt seems like something changed after I installed Fedora, though I suppose that could just be a coincidence. But here's what's puzzling me:\n\n\n*\n\n*Why would installs conducted after formatting the partitions repeatedly fail to properly install a bootloader? Shouldn't a fresh, standard installation of Ubuntu work 99% of the time?\n\n*Why has the installer displayed \"failed to install bootloader\" errors on some occasions but completed without error on other occasions?\n\n*Why am I getting errors about BIOS compatibilty mode when I've been using UEFI and GPT all along?\n\n\nTerrifying possibilities that I've considered but don't know how to diagnose:\n\n\n*\n\n*There's something wrong with my laptop's hardware.\n\n*There's something wrong with the Dell BIOS.\n\n*Fedora made some sort of change to the disk that's persisted despite my repeated attempts to format it and install Ubuntu.\n\n\nA: First, you reported the following Boot Repair message:\n\nGPT detected. Please create a BIOS-Boot partition (>1MB, unformatted filesystem, bios_grub flag). This can be performed via tools such as Gparted. Then try again.\n\nThis message implies that your Boot Repair disc booted in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode. The messages you reported later imply that your installer booted in EFI/UEFI mode, though. This inconsistency could be a factor in your problem, although I don't think it's the sole cause of your problem. If possible, I recommend that you enter your firmware setup utility and disable BIOS/CSM/legacy support. The reason is that enabling this support means you're flipping a coin about your boot mode when you boot, and that creates a potential for problems. It's best to be sure about your boot mode. OTOH, some computers have flaky EFIs, and with them it may be better to install in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode. With such systems, you must at least learn enough about how the firmware operates to be able to force a boot in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode.\nSecond, you're focusing exclusively on the hard disk, but EFI-mode booting relies heavily on the contents of the NVRAM, too. My suspicion is that something is going wrong in your NVRAM setup. This might be a result of firmware bugs, bugs in your OS installers, or mistakes in your installation procedure. In any event, you should boot a live CD in EFI mode and type the following command in a Terminal:\nsudo efibootmgr -v\n\nThis will produce output showing the current contents of your boot entries in NVRAM, like this:\nBootCurrent: 0000\nTimeout: 1 seconds\nBootOrder: 0000\nBoot0000* rEFInd (direct)   HD(2,c00,114000,6e49fcaf-d054-47c9-ba69-a668c5ee8192)File(\\EFI\\refind\\refind_x64.efi)\nBoot0004* UEFI: Built-in EFI Shell  Vendor(5023b95c-db26-429b-a648-bd47664c8012,)..BO\n\nThis example is unusually short and is not likely to be representative of what you'll see, since you'll probably see entries for Ubuntu and/or Fedora. Once you know what's there, you can trim extraneous entries. For instance, if there's a Boot0005 entry that refers to Fedora, you can remove it like this:\nsudo efibootmgr -b 5 -B\n\nChange 5 to whatever is appropriate. (Note that the numbers are hexadecimal.) You may need to issue this command multiple times to remove all the no-longer-valid entries. If you don't understand an entry, be cautious about deleting it; it might be necessary for the computer to boot correctly. If you're wiping the disk clean, though, you should delete all the entries that refer to any OS you've ever installed on it, including Windows, Fedora, and Ubuntu. With any luck, cleaning unused or invalid boot entries out of the NVRAM will enable your Ubuntu installer to create a new entry that the computer will accept. If you see a large number of entries you don't understand, feel free to edit your question to show your efibootmgr -v output. (Reply to this response so I'll know to check back.)\nIt's conceivable that your firmware offers a setup option to help clean out unused boot entries, too, so you could go digging through the firmware setup utility for relevant options.\n\nA: I see that you're not facing any problem in booting into the Xubuntu / Ubuntu Live DVDs whatsoever, so I excluded everything related to the correct procedure and to the potential issues of booting an Ubuntu Live DVD in a Windows 8 laptop in UEFI mode.\nTry again this way:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot from the Xubuntu/Ubuntu Live DVD in UEFI mode\n\n*At the Installation type step, choose the Other option and make sure that the following requirements are met. \n\n\n\nWhen installing in UEFI mode, you need to setup the drive like this (excluding additional partitions like swap or whatever):\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Partition table: GPT\n  \n*One EFI partition present at the start of the drive and matching the following requirements:\n  \n*\n  \n*File system: FAT32\n  \n*Size: at least 100MB (200MB reccomended)\n  \n*Mount point: /boot/EFI\n  \n*Flags: boot\n  \n  \n*One / partition present and matching the following requirements:\n  \n*\n  \n*Mount point: /\n(Please note that the EFI partition's mount point should automatically be set once the partition has been manually added during the partition layout setup)\n\n\nA: I've finally managed to get everything working on this machine, so I wanted to make a quick post here in case anyone runs into this sort of issue in the future. I followed the advice in Rod Smith's answer and cleared out the old boot entries using efibootmgr; that seemed to start me on the right path, but I still ran into issues installing GRUB in Xubuntu 15.10 Beta 1 and, if I recall correctly, 14.04.2. What finally worked for me was installing Xubuntu 14.10 with secure boot enabled. Unfortunately, I didn't take notes as I was going through this process, so I don't have more specific information about what I tried along the way.\n", "Q: Polar Loop not working with Wine or VM I have a new polar loop, and I connected it on USB port.

Ubuntu release later, this is automatically embeded and works well.)\nMaybe I need wait but I'm little bit impatient. :(\nI do not have the choice to use Windows to see my statistics of my polar loop.\n(Ubuntu 14.04, all updates installed, Dell computer.)\n\nA: As noted by David Foester, wine does not have native support for USB devices. So while the Polar Flow sync can run under wine, it will not see the device, and so it will not be able to function.\nLinux can see a USB device has been connected, and identify the type of device, but without driver software, it can do nothing with it.\nA virtual machine can be used:\nFirst, you need VirtualBox and a version of windows. I used the version of Windows made available for testing at https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/vms/ and followed the instructions for installation at https://sites.google.com/site/easylinuxtipsproject/oldgrub\nTo summarise: \n\n\n*\n\n*Install VirtualBox from Oracle\n\n*download the IE11 for Win7 (x86) from Microsoft developer tools (link above) About 4 GB, so takes a long time\n\n*Add yourself to the vboxusers group (sudo adduser your_own_username vboxusers)\n\n*Run virtualbox, and import the .ova file.\n\n*(optionally make a snapshot of the new virtual machine)\n\n*Install VirtualBox Guest Additions\n\n*Set the windows locale and time to your local timezone.\n\n*Within the VM, install Polar Flow Sync (run IE and go to flow.polar.com/start)\n\n*Reboot everything.\n\n*Attach the Polar Device to the computer through the USB connector.\n\n*Use the Devices->USB menu and select the thing that looks most likely. (My device was called \"Polar Oy Electro Polar M200\") See How to set up USB for Virtualbox? for more extensive instructions.\n\n*Flow sync recognises the device connects to it and syncs. Then IE opens and you can see your activity,\n\n\nThis was tested with Virtualbox 5.1, Ubuntu 17.04 and an M200 watch.\n\nA: There is no general support for USB devices in Wine. Every USB device, you can use with Wine, is handled by Linux first and exposed through other, device-type-specific interfaces (HID, printing, file system, audio, video, network, …) to applications running in Wine.\nHence, I wouldn't expect a fitness tracker to work.\n\nA: It works on Kubuntu 18.04\n\n\n*\n\n*Plug in your watch\n\n*Open a terminal window\n\n*type \" sudo lsusb\" to show the usb devices\n\n*You See a \"Polar Electro Oy Loop\" device\n\n*write \"dmesg | grep -i usb\"\n\n*Seach for Polar you see also the serial no of the product later also something like \" hid-generic 0003:0E24:0035.0003: hiddev0,hidraw0: USB HID v1.11 Device [Polar Electro Oy Polar M400] on usb-0000:00:14.0-2/input0\"\n\n*That is good :-)\n\n*we have to create a rule to allow us to rw the hidraw0 device. If you type \"ls -l /dev/\" you see hidraw0 is grand to root only\n\n\n\n*go to \"/etc/udev/rules.d\" create a new file with the editor \"sudo nano hid.rules\"\n\n\n*add > KERNEL==\"hidraw*\", SUBSYSTEM==\"hidraw\", MODE=\"0664\", GROUP=\"dialout\"   < i use the \"dialout\" for a test. \n\n*Save the file\n\n*We have to reload the rules  by typ \"sudo udevadm control --reload-rules\"\n\n*to check type \"ls -l /dev/\" you see dialout as Group by hidraw0 \n\n*We go to the wine cmd by typ \"wine cmd\"\n\n*You see the Version of wine Microsoft Windows 6.1.7601 (3.0)  (I select in Q4wine windows 7)\n\n*We start the wine hid bus \"net start winebus\" see also WineHQ HID\n\n*We change to the Polar Syc directory and start the flowsync.exe \n\n*Normal the flow app start and after some seconds you see your watch for sync.\n\n*you know it from windows  the browser will open and you have to login. i disconect my watch and conect it again to sync in my flow account.\n\n*mybe you have to restart the Flow app if you reconnect your watch.\n\n", "Q: Open up new terminal and run script with double click in Unity I want to execute \nexpect -c \"\n    spawn ssh user@10.0.0.0\n    expect \\\"assword:\\\"\n    send \\\"pass\\r\\\"\n    interact \"\n\nin a new terminal by doing double click in an .sh script.\nI tried \n#!/bin/bash\n\ncommands () {\n    expect -c \"\n    spawn ssh root@10.0.0.0\n    expect \\\"assword:\\\"\n    send \\\"pass\\r\\\"\n    interact \"\n    $SHELL # keep the terminal open after the previous commands are executed\n}\n\nexport -f commands\n\ngnome-terminal -e \"bash -c 'commands'\"\n\nwith no luck. Any ideas?\n\nA: *\n\n*You can use gnome-terminal with the --disable-factory option that does:\n\"Do not register with the activation name server, and do not reuse an already running GNOME terminal process\"\nIt will let the 'commands' environment variable through.\ngnome-terminal typically runs in a server mode. First launch starts a process, next launches send messages to main process to open a new window. So, env vars are set only on the first launch.\n\n*You can use a separate script file and pass its file name to bash. Or make it clever: detect inside this script its actual file name and pass it to bash, so it'll call this same script inside the gnome-terminal (but pass a parameter to take a different code path).\n\n*You can stuff everything into a variable, but make sure that it expands before the call to the gnome-terminal.\n", "Q: BQ Aquaris E4.5 Ubuntu Edition - microSD not recognised fully by the phone I still see that the phone has 3.8GB storage free instead of (3.8GB + microSD).\nIn External Drives I only see a circle going round and round and round.\nI believe that the microSD mulfunctions.\nAny possible solutions?\nNote: Samsung EVO microSDHC UHS-I Card Class10 32GB\n\nA: Install and try with file manager app. To open select the storage swiping up.

Since your libdvdcss.list contains nothing of value--just terminal commands, where instead there should be deb lines--you can simply delete that file, then update the package manager's information about available software:\nsudo rm /etc/apt/sources.list.d/libdvdcss.list\nsudo apt-get update\n\nRun those commands in a Terminal window (Ctrl+Alt+T). If you get no errors from either of those commands, the problem should be fixed.\nAlternatively, if you prefer to fix the problem with a GUI tool, open Software & Updates (on older versions of Ubuntu, it's called Software Sources), go to the Other Software tab, find the entry that looks different from the others (and has sudo in it), and disable it by unchecking it. When you close the dialog, you'll be told \"The information about available software is out-of-date\"; click Reload.\nYou don't have to follow both the command-line and GUI ways of solving this problem; either one by itself should be sufficient. (Though if you try one way and have difficulties, you could then try the other.)\n\nYou'll probably still want to achieve whatever you were trying to do when you ran the commands that produced a malformed libdvdcss.list file. Since I don't know specifically what that is, I cannot point you to advice to achieve it in precisely the way you had hoped. However, my guess is that you were trying to set up Ubuntu so that it will play encrypted (i.e., CSS-encumbered) DVDs.\nTo do that, see How can I play encrypted DVD movies?. Likely it will be sufficient simply to follow mac9416's advice and run:\nsudo apt-get install libdvdread4\nsudo /usr/share/doc/libdvdread4/install-css.sh\n\n", "Q: How to hide a particular account in the login screen?

As mentioned earlier you should back up all your data first to an external disk and then unplug it. Use a copy of the Linux-Partition manager found on your USB-linux boot disk.\nI recommend you get a copy of LMHD-Besty-KDE and flash that to disk with the  USB-image writer. See the Ubuntu / Debina help manual if your unsure how to do it?\nIf you can get a backup disk the same size of your current disk it will be easier to manage partitions. I use a smaller disk for booting so it is faster to backup/wipe.\nThe ubuntu install disk removes the partition manager. You will need the partition manager to reset the /boot flag on the windows partition & to clear any sticky-bits such as DeFrag or drive-inuse. If you choose \"Make New Partition Table\" These problems will be eliminated but so will your data.\nYou can use ubuntu-DISK tool to copy data or check the size of the data but you won't beable to make any partition table changes. Most of the Admin tools are removed when Ubuntu is installed so if you need them you will have to add them back in. I wouldn't try it unless you've done it before. You can really hose things up. \nIf your unsure about how to arrange the partition table get a technician to help you. Otherwise you canust use the windows partion-table manager to overwrite the whole disk. The install windows should take care of that for you but it might leave some left over linux partitions hanging about if you didn't wipe the disk. \nYou will need your drivers disk for the model of the PC you have to finish the install because downloading win8 drivers takes forever. \n\nA: Turn off the PC, and put in the Windows installation USB key.\nBoot the PC to the USB key.\nFrom inside Windows Setup, press Shift+F10 to open a command prompt window.\nOpen the diskpart tool:\ndiskpart\n\nIdentify the drive to reformat:\nlist disk\n\nSelect the drive, and reformat it:\nselect disk <disk number>\nclean\nconvert gpt\nexit\n\nClose the command prompt window.\nContinue the Windows Setup installation.\nWhen choosing an installation type, select Custom.

I've looked through many of those questions and have not found an answer to my complete question. Specifically, I have a few questions that do not seem to be addressed in other questions.\nI'll start by describing what I want to do.\nI have a flash drive with 128 GB disk space. (It's this one)\nI also use a Surface Pro 1 which is my target computer. Lastly I have another flash drive around 8 GB that I can use for any setup purposes. (also, I'm using a usb hub on the computer, dunno if that effects anything.)\nI want to setup the large flash drive so that I can have ubuntu on it and be able to boot to the flash drive from my computer (or another in theory, but that is more of a side goal). I also want there to be a persistent form of storage on the drive that I can access from its ubuntu when I boot to it that is more than 4 GB, so it'll have to be a partition.\nThis is where my problem gets different from others.\nFirst of all, the Surface Pro uses UEFI, and I'm not sure whether or that will cause problems.\nI'll now describe what I tried to do and how it failed.\nFirstly I used Rufus (a linux-on-a-usb-drive maker) to put ubuntu 14.04 onto both of the flash drives. I chose Rufus after some testing since it seemed that was the only one that supported UEFI.\nI followed the instructions here:\nI booted to the smaller flash drive, then partitioned the larger one using gparted. I booted to the large flash drive, but it then seemed to only have the smaller partition. When I opened gparted (still booted to the large flash drive), the larger partition was gone for some reason.\nHow do I get the large partition to work?\nI also have some other questions:\nHow long might the flash drive survive? I saw somewhere that installing full ubuntu onto it would likely damage it because of the frequent reading and writing?\nThe two times I \"booted\" into the two flash drives, a GRUB menu first showed up asking me whether I wanted to Try Ubuntu or Install it. I've chosen Try every time, not knowing what Install will do (and above, whether I should).\nSo should I install ubuntu on the drive? Before when I booted, my wifi settings and other system settings did not seem to persist. Is there a way to make those keep?\nIs there a way to avoid the GRUB menu every time I try to boot to the drive?\nIs what I'm trying to accomplish even feasible?\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: Mkusb, https://help.ubuntu.com/community/mkusb, will automatically make a Grub2 Persistent Live USB with persistent partitions of whatever size you want, (limited only by USB size).\nIt will make the remaining space the first partition with NTFS formating so it can be used by both Linux and Windows.\nIt is a Linux tool but can be easily installed to a Live session on CD and used from there. \nI do not worry about too many writes to Flash drive, they are good for at least 10000 writes, even with a write speed of 50 MB/s that is a long time.\nI think you can edit grub so it does not come up with every boot.\n", "Q: Ubuntu touch compiling: missing msm_ion.h I've started porting Ubuntu Touch to the LG Volt (LS740) from Boost Mobile.

It may suddenly disconnect when I'm editing a Google Docs file, when I'm cleaning my files or when I've walked away and the laptop is idle; it just seems to randomly disconnect all the time. This can greatly vary from a minute or so after booting to a few hours later. Rebooting usually fixes the problem and connects me back. I'm running Lubuntu 14.10.\nAs soon as it disconnects, the network indicator doesn't change. Clicking on it still brings up a list of all the nearby networks. If I ask it to disconnect from the network, the indicator icon will change to a \"Wifi not connected\" icon, however it will still display the networks nearby. If I click to reconnect to my Wi-fi network, it will not reconnect, and the indicator icon will not change. After a while it will change to saying \"Wireless is disabled\" and won't display the nearby networks. It will stay like this until I reboot. I haven't tested to see if it is still searching for networks and displaying them or if it still remembers the names and displays them. Also, as soon as it disconnects, I'm not sure if the actual OS realises that it has disconnected or whether it is just the indicator which doesn't change.\nThis doens't occur when I'm actively using the internet. (e.g. Downloading a file, streaming a video)\nI originally thought this was due to the new wireless modem I bought, as my phone (Nexus 5) also experienceds a similar problem. (The Wi-Fi would disconnect without showing an exclamation mark symbol (the ! indicates there's a wifi connection but no internet). I can turn wifi off and connect to cellular data, then re-enable wifi and it'll be fine. This only happens when my phone is connected to the 2.4Ghz network though) I then realised it was only my two devices which experience this problem, and maybe the two problems are not linked. I also think this because when I do sudo iwlist scan after it disconnects, it says:\nwlan0     Interface doesn't support scanning : Network is down\n\nI have put the full output of sudo iwlist scan and iwconfig on Pastebin if this helps.\nI also ran the Wi-Fi Diagnosis tool and put the result on Pastebin as well.\nHere's the syslog before I disabled the N protocol.\nI disabled the N protocol as @shaddy suggested but the Wi-Fi still disconnected. I put some of the contents of /var/log/syslog here.\nDisabling 802.11n on my laptop and on the router didn't help at all.\n\nA: Edit: This seemed to increase the time it takes before it disconnects, but it will still eventually disconnect. :-(\nWhen I run:\nsudo ifconfig wlan0 down\nsudo rmmod ath5k\nsudo modprobe ath5k nohwcrypt=1\nsudo ifconfig wlan0 up\n\nThe wifi will not disconnect until I reboot.\nTo make this permanent by adding options ath5k nohwcrypt=1 to /etc/modprobe.d/ath5k.conf.\nI then added ath5k to /etc/modules.\n\nSource: here\n\nA: iwlwifi driver has some problems with 802.11n protocol and some Intel wireless cards.\nThe solution is to disable the N protocol and go with probably slower but more reliable variants of the 802.11 protocol.\nYou can achieve this by executing:\nsudo sh -c 'echo \"options iwlwifi 11n_disable=1\" >> /etc/modprobe.d/iwlwifi.conf'\n\nAnd reboot.\nPlease let me know if that works for you.

Then use the proper way.\n\nA: The reason you got stuck after your edit is that the /etc/shadow file contained an entry for the password of tiny but no entry for abc, whereas the /etc/passwd file contained an entry for abc and not for tiny.  When sudo looked, it identified you correctly (according to the password file) as abc based on the UID of the process you were running, but when it looked to compare what you entered as your password with the encrypted (hashed) password stored in /etc/shadow, it couldn't find an entry for abc, so it had to report the failure.\nAs shaddy said in his answer, don't edit the password or shadow files by hand.  If you must break the rule, then edit both in a single invocation of vim, and don't exit from vim until you've proved that the changes are sane enough to work by using another terminal window, and do save backup copies of the files before you start hacking them, and do reconsider why you're breaking the rules in the first place, because it probably isn't a good idea.\n\nA: Use:  vipw\nI have always used this on FreeBSD and just confirmed you can use it for Ubuntu too.

I have Xubuntu 14.10, with the package pulseaudio-module-bluetooth installed, which works fine with my Bluetooth headset.\nI find annoying though, that the headset is automatically connected to the computer, as very often I want it to be connected to another device.\nIs there a way to disable the automatic connection? I can't simply disable Bluetooth as I have a Bluetooth mouse.\n\nA: Hardware solution:\n\n*\n\n*Obtain a cheap USB mouse.\n\n\n*Put your Bluetooth mouse away somewhere safe.\n\n\n*Attach the USB Mouse\n\n\n*Open a terminal and issue the command rfkill list this will give you a listing of rf devices, preceded by an index number.\n\n\n*Issue the command  rfkill block n where n is the index number of the device you wish to block (in this case your bluetooth interface)\nYou can re-enable the device with the command rfkill unblock n where n is the index number of the device you wish to unblock (in this case your bluetooth interface)\nNote: I don't have bluetooth so I tested this process with a different rf device.\n\nSoftware solution:\n\n*\n\n*Install blueman bluetooth manager from the Software Center or with this command:\n sudo apt-get install blueman\n\nNote: Installation requires the \"universe\" repository to be active in your software sources.\n\n\n*Open Blueman from the dash.\n\n\n*Select the headset from the list\n\n\n*Click Setup...\n\n\n*A window will open up, on that window, check Do not connect.\n\n\n*Click Next button\n\n\n*You're done\nYou should be able to connect and disconnect bluetooth devices at will.\n\nA: Another valid, simple solution: don't trust the device. When the connection popup shows up, just (click on) Deny.\n\nA: To prevent a specific device from automatically connecting while leaving it paired, you can untrust the device in bluetoothctl.\n$ bluetoothctl\n# devices\nDevice <MAC> <ID>\n# untrust <MAC>\n\nIf you turn the device  off and on now (while watching the output ofbluetoothctl) you can see it start to connect, but then ask you to trust it and (with no input) eventually timeout. The device will stop sending these connection requests once it pairs with something else.\n[CHG] Device <MAC> Connected: no\n[CHG] Device <MAC> Connected: yes\nAuthorize service\n[agent] Authorize service <UUID> (yes/no): Request canceled\n[CHG] Device <MAC> Connected: no\n\nIf you want to connect the device, you can accept the trust request from bluetoothctl (or maybe your GUI depending on your windows manager). You can re-enable autoconnect with trust <MAC> in bluetoothctl.\n\nA: Install the blueman package and run blueman-manager. Right-click on your headset and choose Remove.\nThis should \"unpair\" your headset. You can always re-pair using the same tool if you want to connect again.\nIt's not perfect, but may be a usable workaround for you.\n\nA: The key thing that worked for me after having tried everything was to go to /etc/bluetooth and edit the main.conf file.\nSet ReconnectAttempts=0\nBy default its commented out. After doing this my bluetooth devices finally stopped autoconnecting.\nI'm not sure if the main.conf file is for blueman specifically so maybe install that too.\nI hope this helps.\n\nA: Answers so far were helpful, but didn't solve the problem for me: I'm using google Pixel Buds Series-A, and whenever I power on my laptop, it steals the buds audio connection from my phone.\n\n*\n\n*Marking the device as untrusted didn't help.\n\n*unpairing is not convenient - to pair I would need to take the buds out of my ears and put them back in the charging case.\n\n*Blueman is supposed to have an option to block a device, but I don't see it Blueman 2.2.4. https://github.com/blueman-project/blueman/pull/1648\nHow I got it to work with bluetoothctl:\n\n*\n\n*Find the device address in the output of bluetoothctl devices\n$ bluetoothctl devices\nDevice 0C:C4:13:12:34:56 Buds\nDevice CD:92:84:12:34:56 MX Master 2S\n\n\n\n*Block the mac address bluetoothctl block 0C:C4:13:12:34:56\n$ bluetoothctl block 0C:C4:13:12:34:56\nChanging 0C:C4:13:12:34:56 block succeeded\n\n\n\n*Now, when I want to connect to the buds again, I need to unblock them first:\nbluetoothctl unblock 0C:C4:13:12:34:56 && bluetoothctl connect 0C:C4:13:12:34:56\n\n", "Q: ARC Welder app showing blank page on Ubuntu 14.04.1 I am using Google Chrome version 41.0.2272.118 (64-bit) in Ubuntu 14.04.1.\nI recently installed the ARC Welder extension from the Chrome Web Store.\nWhen I opened it, it shows a blank window (see image below).\n \nI tried to install apk files using the drag and drop method, but it also failed.\nWhy does it show a blank page?\nHow can I install Android apps in Chrome using ARC Welder?\n\nA: Delete the app, logout of your account, then reinstall ARC Welder.

Can somebody tell me how can I boot Ubuntu?\n\nA: My rough guess is that Fedora installed its grub EFI way, while Ubuntu installed another grub legacy way, so when Fedora tries to pick Ubuntu to show it in its menu, it finds an incompatible step.\nYou might find hints on Why can't I boot into Ubuntu after installing and then erasing Fedora? for manual solutions like list EFI boot entries registered in BIOS with\nsudo efibootmgr -v\n\nand remove extraneous ones with commands like\nsudo efibootmgr -b 5 -B # don't run unmodified, adapt to your case! I did not need such a step\n\nYou might find solutions that might better suit you if you prefer automagical tools Can't boot ubuntu 13.10 after install Fedora 20 on a x86_64 EFI machine but I avoided them, preferring to know what happens.\nWhat I ended up on my machine is to change the boot order in the BIOS setup to choose Ubuntu first.  Then, if I want to boot Fedora I press Esc on BIOS screen which shows an EFI boot menu allowing to choose the OS to boot.  I ignore the fact that different grub instances offer non-working options to boot the other distro(s).\nProbably, if all OSes using grub are configured the same (EFI or legacy), then all grub instances can boot all other OSes (which is the case on a non-EFI machine) but that's not necessary (just inelegant to show non-working options).\n", "Q: No images on any scope on my BQ E4.5 I have a weird problem in that there are no images (pictures) in any scope, including a picture scope.

It was originally configured as a static IP and now it is switched to DHCP. The home directory is an NFS mount and the users are on a NIS server. With no change to the fstab file from what was there before, and what is in every other workstation, the home directories are not usable although it does show the correct permissions for users. However, when logging in, I get: \n-bash: /home_net/<username>/.bash_profile: Operation not permitted\n\nand when trying to touch a file I get:\ntouch: setting times of ‘temp’: No such file or directory\n\nlastly, when I look through dmesg I see:\n[   58.728507] nfs: server <server> OK\n[   58.733960] NFS: Server <server> reports our clientid is in use\n[   58.733965] NFS: state manager: lease expired failed on NFSv4 server <server> with error 1\n\nI've checked the system clock and it seems to match the server.

Why does my NFS drive mount and show the correct permissions but then not actually work?\n\nA: We encountered similar symptoms during an update of a commercial NFS server.\nVery possibly during the network changes the server and client got out of sync. The server is not accepting any file operation requests.  There have been a number of bug fixes in this area.

But I would really want to know:\nWhat process erases the contents of the file and why?\nMy Ubuntu version is 12.04\n\nA: The apt configuration provided by packages is installed as separate files in /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/ so that it can be added and updated independent of any local changes you make in the main configuration file. It's the same idea behind sources.list and sources.list.d or preferences and preferences.d. Either a single file or modular in the directory works.\nThe best solution is to create your own conf file in /etc/apt/apt.conf.d so you can guarantee that it won't be overwritten by package updates.\nsudo touch /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/99mycustomsettings\n\nAnd then you can put your settings in it:\nAcquire::http::Proxy \"http://user:password@ip_addr:port\";\nAcquire::ftp::proxy \"ftp://user:password@ip_addr:port/\";\nAcquire::https::proxy \"https://user:password@ip_addr:port/\";\n\n", "Q: libopencv_features2d.so.2.4 present in /usr/local/lib but executable needs libopencv_features2d.so.2.3 I am a newbie so if this question has been previously asked or it is too rudimentary, please go easy on me and be helpful.\nI have installed opencv-2.4.0 and now I am working on terrain classification code.

Instead, such systems are looking for development libraries and header files, and not the binaries.  Those are usually kept in a separate package with a -dev suffix, in a similar name.  To that end, we need to find the corresponding development headers for the library.\nWhat leptonica-progs which you installed contains are sample programs for the Leptonica library, and not the actual headers/library files.  Searching the packages system under Trusty, I think you will need to install the libleptonica-dev package to install the actual headers and library files for the library itself.\nRun sudo apt-get install libleptonica-dev and then run the ./configure line again, and it shouldn't be triggering on the leptonica dependency anymore.\n", "Q: Network and terminal proxy I use my Ubuntu 14.04 laptop in 2 networks. \nOne of the network requires a network proxy. So suppose initially my laptop doesn't has any network proxy added to it. I switch it on and add the network proxy I need to add (or remove in other case). The problem is that the terminal remembers the original conditions (those before switching on the computer). So when I want to set proxy to the terminal as well, I use\nexport http_proxy='http://host:port'  \nexport https_proxy='http://host:port'\n\nand I check the proxy conditions using env | grep proxy. I get:\nhttp_proxy='http://host:port'\nhttps_proxy='http://host:port'\n\nBut when I close the terminal screen, open it once again and again type\nenv | grep pro\n\nI get no response, i. e. the proxy conditions get unset.\nHow can i get out of this situation?\n\nA: This is happening because when you type in terminal \nexport http_proxy='http://host:port'  \nexport https_proxy='http://host:port'\n\nYou are setting these environment variables only for this terminal session. After you close and open terminal again you start a new terminal session. This is expected behaviour.\nIf you want to do it globally you can put this two lines of code at the bottom of ~/.profile .

It works well.\nBut to use it as the login shell, I added ~/Desktop/Shell/minish at the bottom of /etc/shells and execute chsh and typed ~/Desktop/Shell/minish, but it says minish is an invalid shell.\nI guessed 2 possibilities of this error:\n\n\n*\n\n*Because minish is not in /bin since other shells are all in /bin.\n\n*Because there are some qualifications to be called as a shell, so not any executable file can not be a shell, my minish either.\n\n\nIf the second case is the reason, what are those qualifications or necessaries and how chsh checks this conditions? Or is there any other reason?\nThank you.\n\nA: You put ~/Desktop/Shell/minish verbatim in /etc/shells; the expansion of ~ is a shell feature and likely unsupported by whatever application parses /etc/shells, because it wouldn't know, to whose home directory ~ is supposed to refer. Instead, you need to use the full path name, e. g. /home/analysis/Desktop/Shell/minish.\n", "Q: Set up A- and PTR-records automatically is there a way to make the DNS or DHCP server to set up the A-record and PTR-record for each IP in a subnet? instead of adding one by one?\nthanks\n\nA: There are multiple options depending on your needs.\nbind can be configure with the $GENERATE directive to fill in a range of entries.  This works well if you only want entries that are IP address related. \nMany dhcp clients can be configured to register their lease with a DNS server.  This does introduce some security risk, so it is best to use a dedicated subdomain.

So there arose a bit of a confusion among the experts, which to use while displaying file sizes in different units.\nFor a better explanation, read the Wikipedia entry on binary prefix\n\nThe computer industry currently uses terms such as kilobyte, megabyte, and gigabyte, and corresponding symbols KB, MB, and GB, in two different ways. In citations of main memory or RAM capacity, gigabyte customarily means 1073741824 bytes. This is a power of 1024\n  (specifically 10243), and 1024 is a power of 2 (specifically 210), therefore this usage is referred to as a binary prefix.\nIn most other contexts, the industry uses kilo, mega, giga, etc., in a manner consistent with their meaning in the International System of Units (SI): as powers of 1000. For example, a 500 gigabyte hard drive holds 500000000000 bytes, and a 100 megabit per second Ethernet connection transfers data at 100000000 bit/s. In contrast with “binary prefix”, this usage is referred to as a “decimal prefix“, as 1000 is a power of 10. So later, to avoid confusions, the IEC and NIST standardized them, and changed the symbols...\n\nIn usage, products and concepts typically described using powers of 1024 would continue to be, but with the new IEC prefixes.\nFor example, a memory module of 536870912 bytes (512×1048576) would be referred to as 512 MiB or 512 mebibytes instead of 512 MB or 512 megabytes. Conversely, since hard drives have historically been marketed using the SI convention that “giga” means 1000000000, a “500 GB” hard drive would still be labelled as such.\nAccording to these recommendations, operating systems and other software would also use binary and SI prefixes in the same way, so the purchaser of a “500 GB” hard drive would find the operating system reporting either “500 GB” or “466 GiB“, while 536870912 bytes of RAM would be displayed as “512 MiB”.\nIn simple terms, if an operating system uses the term ‘megabyte’ (MB), then it should use the 1000 bytes per kilobyte (KB), 1000 kilobytes to a megabyte (‘MB‘) etc perceptual value (‘decimal prefix), while converting between the units.\nIf it uses the value 1024 (‘binary prefix’), then it should address them as ‘kibibytes’ (KiB), ‘mebibytes (MiB) etc.\nSo in that sense, it does not matter whether the OS uses the ‘binary prefix’ or the ‘decimal prefix’, what’s important is that it uses the correct symbols to display them.\nIt is apparent that Windows is using the ‘binary prefix’, as if you take the first image, then you will see that it lists the size as ‘710,934,528 bytes’. Now take a calculator and divide it by ‘1024’, which should give you its size in ‘kibibytes’. Then re-divide it again and it will give you the value 678, which is in ‘mebibytes (MiB).\nNow do the same, using the second image that was taken in Ubuntu. But this time, use the value 1000 instead of 1024, and you will get the output in megabytes (MB), 710.9.\nI honestly do not know about ‘IEC’ and ‘NIST’ laws and how they are applied, but Windows, since it uses the ‘binary prefix’, should be using symbols KiB, MiB, GiB etc rather than using KB, MB, GB etc, and therefore seems like in a direct violation as well (the paper only says ‘would’ though).\n\nA: To see RAM in terms that your used to open a terminal and issue the command free -h - I have 2GB of ram in this system and my output is as follows for free -m (which returns results in \"megabytes\": \n$ free -m\n             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached\nMem:          2005       1816        189        259        161        935\n-/+ buffers/cache:        719       1285\nSwap:          973         34        939\n\nfree -h returns (in human readable form):\n$ free -h\n             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached\nMem:          2.0G       1.8G       151M       253M       166M       931M\n-/+ buffers/cache:       756M       1.2G\nSwap:         973M        34M       939M\n\nYou may find this formatting more to your liking!\nAnother reason why your system may report less RAM than installed is RAM reserved by the system for specific purposes, Sometimes there's a reserved video aperture on one of the BIOS setup pages. You may be able to free some up by reducing that size. There are many variables when you get down to system hardware. Your motherboard manufacturer may be able to shed more light on this for you.\nYou can get output on the RAM reserved by the system by issuing the command dmesg | grep BIOS | grep reserved and you may be able to decrease this by modifying settings in the BIOS, but getting it down to zero on a modern system is highly unlikely. You may also find this informative.\n\nA: While the description about KiB/KB and so on in shaddy's answer is correct, it's not correct that the difference is between Linux and Windows, it's only about presentation in particular programs. In particular, free shows results in KiB, which is easy to check on the man page:\n\nShow all output fields automatically scaled to shortest three digits and \ndisplay the units of print out. The following units are used:\n\n   B = bytes\n   K = kibibyte\n   M = mebibyte\n   G = gibibyte\n   T = tebibyte\n   P = pebibyte\n\n\nThe general rule of thumb is usually rather: HDDs: multiplier is 1000, RAM: multiplier is 1024. But best check in docs of the tools you are using.\nAnd to the actual question: As you clarified that you have integrated graphics the correct answer is most likely that some memory is simply reserved for it.\n", "Q: How do I make my Ubuntu Desktop PC a server?

Or am I wrong and the problem has another cause?\nMaybe you can even guess what messed it up so that I can avoid it in the future.

My issue is that when I compile my program (using Code::Blocks if it's important), I get a nice (SFML) window and the debug terminal with my application doing what it should do. But, when I double click the file in nautilus (I hope that's correct), nothing happens. I know the file works because I can quite easily open it from the terminal with ./. So, how can I open the executable without using the terminal?\n\nA: The fix to the problem was reasonably simple, and makes me feel a little dumb. All I had to do was go into the directory that contains the file (with the terminal) then I type sudo ldconfig and, hey presto! It works like a charm. Apparently the problem occurred because the executable couldn't find the libraries, but from double clicking in nautilus, I didn't get any errors, which is why I thought the problem was with nautilus.\n", "Q: Ubuntu, Mercurial unable to commit I'm trying to commit from Netbeans to a mercurial repository.

When I install it I give it just a 7 GB partition. After five days the Ubuntu partition is completely full (low space).\nSo I just booted into Windows 8 and deleted the Ubuntu partition and  created a 40 GB partition for Ubuntu. When I restarted the PC to install Ubuntu 14.04 on that partition again, I got this message:\nerror no such partition grub rescue\n\nI am getting this type of message on every boot. Now I am not able to boot into Windows or Ubuntu. Why?\nThis has happened after deleting the Ubuntu old partition. I don't know what to do now. I don't have any CD ROM in my PC.\nHow should I proceed to install Ubuntu again?\n\nA: When you installed Ubuntu after Windows 8, you also installed the GRUB bootloader which is handled by the Ubuntu GRUB manager which lets you select which operating system to boot. In your case, either Windows or Ubuntu. When you restarted your computer after deleting the Ubuntu partition it is searching for GRUB, but you deleted it. That is why the problem is occurring.\nSolutions: \n\n\n*\n\n*As your PC don't have a CD-ROM drive, you can make an Ubuntu bootable USB pendrive by burning the ISO image file of Ubuntu on to the pendrive (as your PC is not working, you have to use another PC). Then install Ubuntu again on that 40 GB partition with that pendrive. Therefore you can see your Windows and Ubuntu again.\n\n*If you don't want to install Ubuntu, then the most straightforward solution is installing Windows again. As you don't have a CD-ROM drive you can follow solution 1 to install Windows using a pendrive.\n\n\nA: When you deleted your Ubuntu partition, you also chucked out your GRUB installation. GRUB is the bootloader for your machine which lets you boot into either Ubuntu, Windows, or any other present OS.\nTo boot back into Windows, you should be able to interrupt your boot and enter the UEFI by pressing one of the following common keys after powering on: F1 F2 F10 F11 or ESC. Which one works will depend on your laptop's make and manufacturer.\nOnce in UEFI mode, navigate to your boot options and move Windows Boot Manager back to the top of the list. Saving your changes and rebooting your computer should result in loading Windows. Once in Windows, download an Ubuntu 14.04 ISO and burn it to a USB drive using the tool of your choice.\nShut down your computer and turn it back on, then select the Ubuntu Live USB as a temporary boot device (press F12 typically at boot, or reorder your boot devices in UEFI). Follow the instructions for a dual boot system presented at the install screen.\n\nA: Use the Ubuntu live CD and then use the GParted partition editor to set the boot flag to your Windows partition. (Right click on the Windows partition -> Manage flags -> Boot). This will let you boot Windows (like having a single Windows OS).\nAfterwards, install Ubuntu again (as you did before to get a dual-boot system), this time using the bigger space.\n", "Q: How can I upgrade gnome-terminal on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS?

After writing to a device it's recommended and possible to \"securely remove\" the device by unmounting it. That implies to have a parition to unmount which implies to have a partition table managing that partition. After writing e.g. an Ubuntu Live iso with dd, on a device the parition layout which was valid during mount is no longer present because overwritten. If the device was never mounted the same issue occurs. I see activity on the USB pendrive I'm writing to for several seconds after dd finished which definitely means a change to mess up the write action. How can I make sure that no data writes are pending when I unplug the device?\n\nA: As root run the command sync or if a normal user run sudo sync (this will ensure the write cache is flushed and that it is safe to unmount your SD card).\nSo , after dd command has finished run\nsudo sync\n\nAfter that you are safe to remove the drive you write to (This flushes anything that remains cached).\n", "Q: Unable to dual-boot Ubuntu 14.04 with pre-installed Windows 8.1 (Sony Vaio S series Laptop) I recently installed Ubuntu on dual-boot mode with pre-installed Windows 8.1.

I have tried using easyBCD to do this but as I am booting in UEFI mode it fails to work. Is there a way to manually add it in using bcdedit or another piece of software? I tried using easyUEFI but had no success. I don't really want to use GRUB2 as my main boot manager.\n\nA: First, some terminology:\n\n\n*\n\n*A boot loader loads a kernel into memory and executes it.\n\n*A boot manager presents a menu that lets you select which OS to boot.\n\n\nGRUB does both jobs for Linux, although it can't load a Windows kernel directly; to boot Windows, GRUB redirects to the Windows boot program. Likewise, the Windows boot program cannot directly load a Linux kernel (but see below) and so is a poor choice for booting Linux, although I believe that it (like GRUB) includes both boot loader and boot manager functionality, and so can (theoretically) be configured to redirect to GRUB. Knowledge of how to do this under BIOS is fairly widespread, but people who've managed to do it under EFI are relatively rare.\nOne significant twist on this is that since version 3.3.0, the Linux kernel has included its own EFI boot loader, so an EFI boot manager can launch a Linux kernel, even if that boot manager doesn't have Linux boot loader capabilities. In fact, rEFInd and gummiboot rely on this feature; these programs are both technically boot managers, but they can launch a Linux kernel that has an EFI stub loader. In theory, the Windows boot program might be able to launch Linux in this way. In practice, this would be difficult to get working, since the kernel needs parameters passed to it in order to work, and configuring the Windows boot program to pass the right parameters is likely to be even trickier than getting it to pass control to GRUB. I've never heard of anybody even trying this, much less getting it to work.\nOn this forum, you're much more likely to find expertise and advice on using GRUB, rEFIt, rEFInd, or gummiboot as your primary boot manager than on using the Windows boot program as a boot manager. If you really must use the Windows boot program as a boot manager, I recommend you ask on a Windows forum.\n\nA: The Windows Boot Manager in UEFI mode will not boot other operating systems or legacy Windows OSes according to both Windows 10 forum and EasyBCD. So that's a no go.\n", "Q: Error installing Ubuntu on VirtualBox I'm trying to install many different versions of Ubuntu (12.04/14.04, amd64/x86, server/desktop, etc.) on VirtualBox 14.3.26 on OSX 10.10 and I'm getting the following error:\n[ 0.000000] Fast TSC calibration failed.]\n\nIt's the first and only thing to show on the screen before the VM turns off and the VM window disappears (so that the only VirtualBox Manager screen is showing). Strangely, I was able to successfully install once (14.04LTS desktop amd64) before getting all of these failed attempts only minutes later.\nWhat's going on here?\n\nA: That is generally a non-fatal message (as was previously described here).  If your virtual machine is not working, the cause is probably elsewhere.\n\nA: After trying many different ISO's, different VM emulated hardware combinations, digging through VirtualBox logs, and addressing the OSX Crash Reporter error logs... I simply installed an older VirtualBox (4.2.x) and restarted my Mac which solved the problem.\n", "Q: Can't boot a live usb .iso in UEFI mode on Lenovo Edge-15 laptop I was trying to install Gentoo on my laptop Lenovo Edge-15, but I'm having problems booting a live usb .iso in UEFI mode.  I then tried to install Ubuntu, Arch, and Fedora, and seem to be having the same problem with all of them.\nThrough copious amounts of experimentation/trial/error, I've gathered that my laptop is refusing to boot my USB flash drives into UEFI mode for some reason.  Secure boot is disabled.  I've and enabled/disabled USB booting with expected results, and I've also enabled/disabled support for Legacy/BIOS mode booting.  When I support only BIOS mode booting, no Linux installation will ever start, but when I enable support for BIOS/Legacy mode booting, all linux installations can begin but they randomly crash during the installation process.\nEDIT to be more specific, when loading from USB media with Legacy mode/bios mode allowed, when installing Linux, the liveCD environment always begins to load, but then randomly crashes before the system is fully set up.  At this point, I am dropped into a shell with no drivers, no internet and no distribution utilities, just a few shell built ins.  When I tried to install Gentoo, I actually wrote the Gentoo install .iso to it's own partition on my hard drive beforehand.  Then when I tried to boot from the Gentoo USB, the Gentoo pre-install live environment loaded from this disk partition as if it was an install CD and couldn't detect the USB.\nDuring my attempt to install Gentoo, when I reached the step for writing the boot instruction to the GPT, I got an error message saying UEFI variables are not supported on this system, despite the fact that this occurred right after (in the Gentoo process) I had just compiled the Linux Kernel and manually and specifically enabled support for UEFI variables.  The same error message ocured weather I tried to write an instruction to load GRUB2 or when I used uefiloader.\nMy guess is that this means the fact that the live environment was booted in BIOS mode makes it impossible for a new kernel to be loaded and interact with the GPT, despite if the kernel supports it, and that the same problem is occurring with other distros.\nI have a separate laptop (it has a BIOS mode drive and no Windows OS) and I have tried the same procedures and was able to install a fresh Kubuntu.\nThe procedure I have been using to attempt each Linux install was to download the *.iso file on my old linux laptop, sudo su, dd bs=4M if=linux.iso of=/dev/sdb && sync (after checking the correct /dev/ with lsblk), and then booting the usb on my new laptop.\nThis related question directed me to check out This tool.  I tried using it (with Legacy/BIOS booting enabled) and curiously, my laptop refuses to boot it.  Don't know if that helps.\nI had installed Kubuntu before, so I know it's possible with this hardware, but something has changed that is making it fail.  It could possibly be due to the original Kubuntu installation itself a several months ago, a failed Arch Linux installation attempt later, and a failed Kali Linux installation attempt a little later.\nSo can anyone help me figure this out?  Why is my system not booting usb ISOs in UEFI mode?\n\nA: First, let's clear up a terminology issue that may be leading you astray (although it's unlikely to be the cause of your main problem). You wrote:\n\nMy guess is that this means the fact that the live environment was booted in BIOS mode makes it impossible for a new kernel to be loaded and interact with the GPT, despite if the kernel supports it, and that the same problem is occurring with other distros.\n\nThe GUID Partition Table (GPT) is a disk-based data structure that defines your partitions. It does not control the boot process, although the boot process will use GPT to help it find boot files. GPT may be used in either a BIOS-mode or an EFI-mode boot, but in different ways:\n\n\n*\n\n*In a BIOS-mode boot, the BIOS reads the first sector of the disk and executes code stored there. This code normally loads code stored elsewhere on the disk, which then loads other code, and so on until the kernel is running. Details vary with your boot loader.\n\n*In an EFI-mode boot, an entry in the computer's NVRAM (off the disk) points to a file on the EFI System Partition (ESP), which is a FAT partition that holds boot loaders and related data. The EFI runs this file as an EFI program, and this file (the boot loader) loads the kernel and executes it.\n\n\nNote that in EFI mode, the boot process relies on data stored in NVRAM. This NVRAM-based data may be accessed and changed in an OS, but to do so, the computer must be booted in EFI mode; you can't change EFI boot variables in BIOS mode. These variables are not stored in GPT data structures, though; and the only relationship they have to GPT data is that they encode a partition's GUID value so that the EFI can load the right file from the right partition.\nThat out of the way, there's an elephant in the room:\n\nwhen I enable support for BIOS/Legacy mode booting, all linux installations can begin but they randomly crash during the installation process.\n\nWhen a program or OS (especially a mature and robust OS like Linux) fails \"randomly,\" that's almost always a sign of a hardware problem. If I had to put money on it, I'd say \"bad RAM,\" but there are other possibilities, too, such as a bad CPU, a bad hard disk, a damaged trace on your motherboard, or a bad power supply. You might be able to work past your EFI issues, but it's very likely it won't be any more reliable than your BIOS-mode boots. If this is a new computer, you should seriously consider returning it for a refund and get another one for this reason. If it's not new, the question is whether it might have exhibited problems before now. For instance, if you're trying to install Linux because Windows was crashing, it could well be that those crashes were caused by the same bad hardware that's causing your Linux installs to fail.\nMoving on to the installation issue, your steps for booting in EFI mode sound reasonable; however, you should carefully review the boot options in your boot manager (whatever key you hit to get a menu of boot options that include your USB drive). Most EFI-based computers that also support BIOS-mode booting provide two boot options for USB drives and optical discs: One includes the string \"UEFI\" and the other doesn't. The string with \"UEFI\" in the description boots in EFI mode and the other one boots in BIOS mode. To start the installer in EFI mode, you must select the \"UEFI\" option.\nIf you're doing this, it's conceivable that your firmware is flaking out on the Frankenstein's monster nature of a dd-created USB drive. If your computer has an optical disc, try that instead. If it doesn't, try using another tool to create your USB drive. Unfortunately, this can be tricky to get right, because some tools (especially older ones) lack the ability to create an EFI-bootable image. Read the instructions for whatever you use to be sure it supports EFI-mode booting. Some tools require you to select particular options to make an EFI-bootable disk. I can't be more specific than this because I don't recall the details of what I've seen; I generally use dd-created images myself.\nAnother option is to use my rEFInd boot manager to control the boot process. You can download several images, including ones intended to be written to CD-R or USB flash drive. rEFInd may be able to redirect into your USB-based installer; or you can install in BIOS mode and then use rEFInd to boot the installation. (EFI-mode and BIOS-mode installs of Linux typically vary only in their boot loaders, and rEFInd on a USB drive or CD-R can fill that role.)\n\nA: If you want to install ubuntu in UEFI mode you can do that by following these steps.\nYou need a Windows OS to write the USB.\nYou have to burn iso image to your USB using a different software and then you can install it as usual, without turning UEFI or fastboot off. Just follow these simple steps\nDownload Ubuntu 14.04, 14.10 or 15.04 Disk Image.\nDownload and install wind32Diskimager http://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager/\nOpen the software, locate your downloaded Ubuntu Image and removable drive and click write.\nBoot from usb and install ubuntu. (Remember to not chose the option which says install alongside windows but the option which says something else).\nDiskimager creates a UEFI partition in your USB which works with UEFI mode.\nAlso make sure you reboot to windows when USB writing is finished so the USB drive disappears from This PC, you can go to Disk Management and see if it has written it correctly. Your USB will have three partitions, two unallocated partitions and a UEFI.\n", "Q: Links and installation of codelite dependencies I know you might want to mark this as an \"duplicate\" but it's not.\nAll the answers on similar questions are either outdated or don't really include dependencies installation. dist-upgrade didn't help either.\nsudo apt-get install codelite wxcrafter\n\ngives me following errors:\n    The following packages have unmet dependencies:\n codelite : Depends: libglib2.0-0 (>= 2.41.1) but 2.40.2-0ubuntu1 is to be installed\n            Depends: libhunspell-1.3-0 (>= 1.3.3) but 1.3.2-6ubuntu2 is to be installed\n            Depends: xterm\n            Depends: libedit-dev but it is not going to be installed\n libjbig0 : Breaks: libjbig0:i386 (!= 2.0-2ubuntu4.1) but 2.0-2ubuntu1 is to be installed\n libjbig0:i386 : Breaks: libjbig0 (!= 2.0-2ubuntu1) but 2.0-2ubuntu4.1 is to be installed\nE: Unmet dependencies.

What I want is to change colours or use part of one theme in another(eg. scroll bar). I tried to find some tutorials but everything seemed so overwhelming. \nAlso if someone could explain how themes work in XFCE - eg. how come that some apps use theme just for part of their interface (eg. Linux Mint's software center's searchbox turns yellow resulting in unreadable text).  \n\nA: You can use a tool called Xfce Theme Manager \nYou can change the themes from a single GUI.\nXfce Theme Manager  also includes thumbnails.\nXfce Theme Manager allows settings the following:\nComplete Xfce theme.\nIcon theme\nCursor theme\nWindow borders only\nControls only\nChange the wallpaper\nCustomizable theme preview size.\nSave the current theme.\nInstall themes using drag'n'drop.\nReset the theme.\n\nYou can install Xfce Theme Manager from a PPA. \nOpen a terminal by hitting Ctrl+Alt+T. \nRun the following commands:\nsudo -i\nadd-apt-repository ppa:rebuntu16/other-stuff \napt-get update\napt-get install xfce-theme-manager\n\n\nA: You can go to /usr/share/themes/YOUR-THEME to tweak the CSS. The main file for this is gtkrc often located in the gtk-2.0 directory. Be sure to read the comments in the document. Here is an example of an edit I made when the background color, bg_color, in the theme Greybird was a little too gray for me (/usr/share/themes/Greybird/gtk-2.0/gtkrc). \n# gtk-color-scheme  = \"bg_color:#CECECE\\nselected_bg_color:#398ee7\\nbase_color:#fcfcfc\" # Background, base.\ngtk-color-scheme    = \"bg_color:#EEEEEE\\nselected_bg_color:#C3D4AA\\nbase_color:#fcfcfc\" # Background, base. \n\nI commented out the original so there would still be a record if I wanted to go back. You will need to log out or change your theme and return to it again for the changes to be applied. Often gtkrc will have a gtk-color-scheme section at the top of the file. This is the overall color scheme. \nI recommend going to Window Manager > Style tab to try different options. Also customize in Appearance > Style and Icons tabs. Playing with those three options can offer a lot of possibilities. I really like setting a custom color. On Xubuntu 14.04, I have Daloa as the Window Manager, Orion as my theme (Style tab in Appearance), and elementary Xfce darker as my Icons. Then in Theme Configuration, gtk-theme-config, I have custom colors set. With this setup I have nice green accents throughout my system.\n\nIf you have Xfce 4.12, Orion is not installed there, but there I use Greybird theme. (This is on my Fedora Xfce install.) Greybird also does a nice job of populating my theme color throughout the system.       \nSometimes a theme may not cover every aspect of every program. In these cases the default theme would be used. In Xubuntu 14.04 this is Raleigh. Only certain themes have an accompanying Window Manager style. If they do have it, there will be an xfwm directory in the theme's directory with a themerc file:cd /usr/share/themes && find . -type d -name \"xfwm4\" -print | sort \nI recently installed Numix on Fedora Xfce (particularly for the icons). It is a nice looking theme and is available for Xubuntu. http://www.webupd8.org/2013/08/new-ppa-for-numix-gtk-and-icon-themes.html \nTo answer the part about using one part of a theme in another, I wanted to make my Xfce panel have a text shadow with using Orion. I noted that I liked Greybird's text shadow on its panel. Instead of combing through the CSS in Orion to see what to change or add, I backed up /usr/share/themes/Orion/gtk-2.0/apps/panel.rc. Then I just replaced this file with /usr/share/themes/Greybird/gtk-2.0/apps/xfce-panel.rc. Worked just fine.  \n", "Q: Problems installing rEFInd through windows after Ubuntu install I installed Ubuntu alongside Windows and I can't figure out how to boot into Ubuntu.

I get this error, \"Invalid drive specification 0 File(s) copied\"\n\nA: It sounds like the ESP wasn't mounted at S:. Did you get any errors with the mountvol command earlier in the procedure? If so, you should correct those errors.\nAs an alternative, consider downloading the USB flash drive or CD-R version of rEFInd and booting with it.

It's way to complicated to fix now, and I regret not using my entire disk, so I want to reinstall everything from scratch. I don't care about saving any data or settings or anything.\nThis might sound silly, but the problem I am having now is simply accessing the live disk again. Now that I have successfully installed Ubuntu Server, every time I try to boot the Live USB, it redirects me to the installed version on my disk.\nHow do i bypass this and simply reinstall Ubuntu Server again?\n\nA: During the installation, I was asked if I wanted GRUB to be installed on the harddrive to simplify dual boot. Somehow it was installed on the USB instead of the harddrive. Because of this, every time I tried booting from the USB, it bypassed the live-usb and kept on booting the server instead.\nTo solve it I just created a new live-usb.\n\nA: You may have to enter your BIOS and change the boot device order to ensure that the USB is booted first.  Unfortunately the procedure for this varies widely between manufacturers but generally a message will appear briefly after a restart telling you which key to press to enter the BIOS or Setup or Configuration screens.  Then find the boot order settings and ensure that USB is first.\n", "Q: Setting up DNS on JUJU for local So I have found Juju, which looks amazing! However a huge blocker for me is not knowing how to setup DNS.\nI have a dedicated server running Ubuntu 14.04LTS with JuJu installed, running local containers. However, I cannot access any of them from the internet. Ideally, I'd like to use existing domains and map them to services running on JuJu such as Worpdress, MediaWiki, etc.\nI only have one public IP address (IPv4 but a /64 block of IPv6), I suppose the plan would be to map charms to specific ports then use the nameserver to handle resolution to port.\nI'm used to Plesk, cPanel and VestaCP. Do I simply deploy/create a BIND/Webmin Charm for easy DNS mapping or am I totally offbase here?\nFor clarity, I'd like to setup custom nameservers at my registrar to the server IP (ns1.example.com, ns2.example.com) and have domains, subdomains, etc be routed to specific ports (such as Wordpress running on port 8080 going to name example2.com)\nThanks!\n\nA: You are using the local provider, which is only suitable for development and testing scenarios. For one, as you discovered, the addresses that these containers get are local only.\nIf you have only one IPv4 address and that's what you want to use, you will have to play with some iptables NAT rules. You could perhaps get away with https://github.com/cmars/juju-nat but I haven't personally used that.\nWhen using juju, you have to pick a provider. The choices are basically cloud and non-cloud. Among the non-cloud ones:\n\n\n*\n\n*manual: you install the OS, an ssh server, and tell juju to use that machine. It can be a real machine, or a container, KVM instance, etc.\n\n*MAAS: more complex but more powerful, with MAAS you can use real machines to deploy juju services and manage DHCP and DNS.\n\n\nYou can probably give the manual provider a try to get your feet wet, but it's quite a bit, er, manual, as the name implies. But could be what you need if you setup the IP and NAT rules appropriately. It loses its appeal once you start handling more dynamic services, because you have to keep provisioning new machines manually for juju to use.\n\nA: I have the same juju deployment problem. What I have already done, is to consolidate several http / https services under distinct URLs with Apache2. This is a configuration snipped installed on /etc/apache2/sites-available on my server. It allows public URLs on a single domain name, to be rerouted to any private address.\nIn my setup, there is a working private DNS, so I can simply route the request to the machine named \"jeedom\", and I still do not know how to allocate private names to the machines created using Juju. If the IPs of Juju units are stable, specifying an IP is possible.

Linux' sogoupinyin is based on fcitx, so we have to make sure it is installed. You can do so by firing up a terminal with SHIFT + ALT + T and typing:\n\nsudo apt-get update\n  sudo apt-get install fcitx\n\nThis should run on its own. After installation is complete, your system uses fcitx as input method. To check if it does, go to language support and check the entry Keyboard input method system. It should now say fcitx.\n\n*Install Sogoupinyin.\nThen run the installer file sogoupinyin_xxxxx.deb that you have downloaded from the Sogou website. It will open the Software Center of your Ubuntu installation and ask for your root password.\n\n*Restart your machine.\nYou are good to go. After the restart the fcitx-autostart should be called upon login. Alternatively, simply run fcitx-autostart from the terminal with the same effect, but give it a second or two for the startup. You will then be able to configure sogoupinyin in a way similar to the Windows or Mac versions of the software.\nHope it helps.\n\nA: u.Hi, basically you need to add ppa:fcitx-team/nightly,\nthen update fcitx in your linux distro, last install the deb package downloaded from official website.

I've been using a second monitor with the laptop since I got it, and it's basically been plug-and-play. I connect the monitor via HDMI, and usually it just fires right up. Last night, I unplugged the monitor to take the computer upstairs. I noticed it was still behaving as if the second monitor was there. So I logged out and logged back in--problem solved. Today, I plug the monitor back in, and Ubuntu doesn't detect it. I've spent the last half hour unplugging, plugging back in, restarting, tweaking settings, and browsing forums without much luck. Most of the tips seem to have to do with getting a second monitor working in the first place. It was working yesterday. But now the laptop just doesn't seem to notice it's there.\n\nA: Some system updates came out today, and I applied those using Synaptic Package Manager. After the update and another reboot, the dual-monitor system is working again. I don't see anything in the updates that appear to have anything to do with display, but my guess is that maybe running the updates flushed out whatever the disconnect was that was keeping the second monitor from being picked up.\n\nA: As I suspected, this was no fluke: Your monitors.xml contained an erroneous configuration without HDMI.\nHere is the corrected version that only contains one single configuration (the original that worked without any problems)\nNow\n\n\n*\n\n*Replace your existing version with my corrected one\n\n*Keep a back-up of the corrected  just in case this ever happens again…\n\n\nA: By sheer coincidence I had a similar problem right here with this computer only yesterday.

I recommend it to all my friends.\nI gave a vial of this to my girlfriend two years ago, and of all the gifts I've given her for birthdays, holidays, and anniversaries, I'm sorry to say this is what she uses the most.  A few months ago she \"fixed\" her daughter's iphone when it refused to charge merely dabbing this on the charger plug.  When her 14 year old daughter asked how that fixed it, my girlfriend's response was \"It's Magic\".\nSo you see, while this is not the same magic recommended by another, it is a useful tool necessary in any geek's arsenal, and it is available online.\n", "Q: Is an application in Ubuntu allowed to open other applications if it does not have elevated privileges? Let's assume an application in Ubuntu is compromised. \nSince, by default, downloaded applications do not have root privileges, no major damage can occur. The worst a malicious hacker can possibly do is mess with non-system related files or folders, right?\nHowever, can the non-privileged compromised application open other applications or programs within Ubuntu? For example, the Software Centre or the Terminal\n\nA: Yes, any process running with the privileges of one user is allowed do anything that user is allowed to do herself.\nAs you correctly state, this is less of a problem, if that user doesn't have super-user privileges, which would allow him and any of her processes to modify the system configuration. Installing system-wide packages through a front-end like Software Center still requires super-user privileges.\nFor that reason, one should carefully choose which programs to run at elevated privileges.\n\nA: a lot of security holes allow \"arbitrary code\" and many applications, firefox for example, or vim, allow you to start external programs or a shell or other code. Once a malicious user gets a shell they can do damage without root access or they can try to escalate privileges.\nThis is where one would use something such as apparmor or selinux to prevent further damage.\n", "Q: disk drive for /home is not ready yet or not present when loading Ubuntu Server 14.04.2 on VMware Hi I have Ubuntu Server 14.04.2 LTS installed on a VMware station.

I know /etc/profile and ~/.profile are among the start-up scripts used when ssh is used to login to a server – i. e. using ssh with server argument. However, the scenario where I am just using ssh with a server+command argument does not seem to pick up the same start-up scripts.\nAssume I have bash as default shell. If .bashrc exists, I know it is picked up in this scenario. But if .bashrc does not exist and no other personal profiles exist, what else runs?\nIs there another global script that provides the environment variables?\n\nA: This page has more than you probably want to know about it, but it's a great concise resource:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://mywiki.wooledge.org/DotFiles\nBasically, when you ssh to a computer, you are not running a 'login' shell, so different files are sourced.  In short, if your default shell is /bin/bash (default on Ubuntu), you will be sourcing a ~/.bashrc in your home directory.  Check the FILES section of the bash man page (man bash), near the end, for other files that come into play.\nAlso, make sure you are on the lookout in your .bashrc for lines that exit if not using an 'interactive' shell.  A good way to figure this stuff out is to put in prints in your .bashrc and keep experimenting until you figure it out.\nLike this:\n# ~/.bashrc:\n\necho \"HERE I WAS!\"\n\n# Exit here unless an interactive session.\n[ -z \"$PS1\" ] && return\n\necho \"HERE I AM!\"\n\n\nA: Without a command, SSH runs a login shell. For bash, that involves sourcing .profile (which, on Ubuntu, sources .bashrc) (and /etc/profile, which sources /etc/bash.bashrc). There are other files which could be sourced instead, such as .bash_profile, but a default Ubuntu setup has only .profile.\n$ grep bashrc /etc/profile .profile\n/etc/profile:    # The file bash.bashrc already sets the default PS1.\n/etc/profile:    if [ -f /etc/bash.bashrc ]; then\n/etc/profile:      . /etc/bash.bashrc\n.profile:    # include .bashrc if it exists\n.profile:    if [ -f \"$HOME/.bashrc\" ]; then\n.profile:   . \"$HOME/.bashrc\n\nWhen run with a command, SSH doesn't run a login shell, so, according to man bash (section INVOCATION):\nWhen an interactive shell that is not a login shell  is  started,  bash\nreads  and  executes  commands  from /etc/bash.bashrc and ~/.bashrc, if\nthese files exist.  This may be inhibited by using the  --norc  option.\nThe  --rcfile  file option will force bash to read and execute commands\nfrom file instead of /etc/bash.bashrc and ~/.bashrc.\n\nHowever, with a command, bash is not being run interactively. Then why is .bashrc sourced? Again, from man bash:\nBash attempts to determine when it is being run with its standard input\nconnected to a network connection, as when executed by the remote shell\ndaemon, usually rshd,  or  the  secure  shell  daemon  sshd.   If  bash\ndetermines  it  is  being  run  in  this fashion, it reads and executes\ncommands from ~/.bashrc and ~/.bashrc, if these  files  exist  and  are\nreadable.  It will not do this if invoked as sh.  The --norc option may\nbe used to inhibit this behavior, and the --rcfile option may  be  used\nto  force  another file to be read, but neither rshd nor sshd generally\ninvoke the shell with those options or allow them to be specified.\n\nOther files could be read by SSH (from man ssh, section FILES):\n~/.ssh/rc\n     Commands in this file are executed by ssh when the user logs in,\n     just before the user's shell (or command) is started.

I am not much of a Ubuntu person, nor Linux. My Chromebook's capacity is 16 GB, and I only get to use about 8-9 GB. I already installed League of Legends using PlayOnLinux, so I am left with around 2 GB. I went to the store and bought a 32 GB flash drive to install my games on instead. How do I do this? I have the game installers, skyrim, gta, etc.. Just need to be able to install them on to the flash drive and be able to run them from the flash drive. (pretty much another wine C:/ on the flash drive). I made a letter in Drive Mapping to my USB Drive but when I install Skyrim it still installs it to the C on my computer's 16gb of memory :(\nThanks in advance, if this can't be done then just please tell me. Thank you! :)\n\nA: I hope you're using separate Wine prefixes for each application managed by Wine/POL, because that would make the following much easier.\nPlayOnLinux stores its Wine prefixes underneath ~/.PlayOnLinux/wineprefixes/. As with all files and directories, you can move any or all prefixes anywhere else and then place a symbolic link to the new location at their old place.\nLet's assume, that you have a secondary storage drive mounted at /media/mystorage. There are now two alternatives:\n\n*\n\n*To move all existing and future Wine prefixes managed by POL:\n mv -T ~/.PlayOnLinux/wineprefixes /media/mystorage/wineprefixes\n ln -sT /media/mystorage/wineprefixes ~/.PlayOnLinux/wineprefixes\n\n\n\n*To move only some Wine prefixes managed by POL (in this example called warcraft, steam, LoL)\n\n*\n\n*create a directory /media/mystorage/wineprefixes\n\n\n*and run\n for f in warcraft steam LoL; do\n     mv -T ~/.PlayOnLinux/wineprefixes/\"$f\" /media/mystorage/wineprefixes/\"$f\"\n     ln -sT /media/mystorage/wineprefixes/\"$f\" ~/.PlayOnLinux/wineprefixes/\"$f\"\n done\n\nYou need to repeat this step for every new Wine prefix, that you want to move somewhere else.\nWith some trickery you can\n\n*\n\n*create a new Wine prefix through POL by starting a new installation process,\n\n*abort the installation process after creating the Wine prefix,\n\n*move the prefix as described earlier, and\n\n*only then install the Windows application by choosing to alter an existing prefix.\n\n\n\nThere's also an entry in the official PlayOnLinux wiki: How to move PlayOnLinux virtual drives to another disk\n", "Q: How should I install Ubuntu onto a new SSD drive with Windows 7 on my old hard drive? So I am buying a new 250 GB SSD drive and caddy to replace my CD Drive with. The laptop that I am installing this on currently has only Windows 7 on it. I plan on keeping the current hard drive in it just for Windows 7 and then using the SSD just for Ubuntu (I'm trying to install Ubuntu on the SSD).\nNote that I am trying to also have the option to boot either Ubuntu or Windows at startup, so only one or the other.\nWould I have to install the SSD under Windows first? Or would I have to create a partition for Ubuntu in my current hard drive and then use Ubuntu to install the SSD, then reinstall Ubuntu onto the SSD? Is it possible to simply replace my CD drive with the SSD without doing anything with software (will my computer recognize it for use right away?) so that I can boot Ubuntu directly from a USB flash drive onto the SSD? I'm very confused about how to go about this process, answers are very appreciated!\n\nA: The Ubuntu installer will recognize the drive as long as it's properly connected. You can build the necessary partitions to run Ubuntu fully on the SSD. So you don't have to do anything in Windows as long as it's properly connected.\nI have a similar setup but on a tower PC.\nBe aware that you have to create some 4 different partitions on that SSD for the EFI boot loader, root partition, home partition and swap partition.\nLook around for some Ubuntu manual installation tutorials.\n\nA: There's nothing special about an installation to a secondary drive. No need to fiddle with Windows or install to the primary drive first. I have Windows on a hard disk drive and Ubuntu on a solid state drive as you intend.\n\n\n*\n\n*Perform a regular installation of Ubuntu,\n\n*choose the option ”Something Else”,\n\n*select the new drive and partition and format it to your liking and assign the necessary/desired mount points to those partitions,\n\n*pay attention to the boot loader location (also selectable from the partition manager during installation), which needs to be on the drive that your BIOS is configured to look at for a boot loader (see section below),\n\n*proceed with the installation as normally.\nRepairing a botched/misconfigured boot loader\nIf you run into an issue in step 4, fret not. The worst thing, that can happen, is, that the BIOS only finds Microsoft's boot loader on the old drive and only boots Windows. You can change both the boot order in the BIOS and the location of Ubuntu's boot loader Grub after the installation, if you select the wrong drive or change your mind.\nSome recommended resources to resolve boot loader issues with Grub:\n\n\n*\n\n*How can I repair grub?\n\n*Boot-Repair\nIf none of these lead to a (satisfying) solution, open a new question and include a link to the info log created by Boot-Repair.\n", "Q: In a dual boot, why can I see and mount the Windows partition, labeled 'OS'? Does it present a security threat in any form?\n\nA: Not really a security threat; ubuntu comes with ntfs-3g by default so it can read/mount ntfs partitions from the get go. Granted, one could use your linux partition to nuke the windows partition, but that's on you, not the os. Secure both OSs and the issue is nonexistant :)\n", "Q: Black screen after upgrading to Ubuntu 14.04 I upgraded from Ubuntu 12 to 14.04 from the updater, and the installation seemed to go fine.

While using byobu, my terminal tab's title is set to user@fqdn (IP) - byobu, which can be pretty long depending on the domain. How can I limit it to something shorter, like user@hostname, or better yet, let zsh set the title? I have tried setting BYOBU_NO_TITLE=1, following this bug, but that, I think, allows the local shell to set the title, not the remote one.\nThis can be very annoying, since Terminator sets every tab header's length to the same, so one very long title is enough to make all of them very long. Worst case, I'd like it if I could simply trim off some of it to a maximum length (like user@f ... byobu).\nI already have added a function to .zshrc to set the title:\ncase $TERM in\n    xterm*|screen*)\n        if [[ -n $SSH_TTY ]]\n        then\n            precmd () {print -Pn \"\\e]0;%m: %~\\a\"}\n        else\n            precmd () {print -Pn \"\\e]0;%~\\a\"}\n        fi\n        ;;\nesac\n\nThis works if I don't use byobu:\n\nThe tab on the left is an SSH session without byobu, and the one on the right is with byobu.\nWith Serg's suggestion of setting IP_EXTERNAL to 1, I can get rid of the IP, shortening the title. I'd prefer a solution that passes on the title set by zsh (or other applications, such as Vim) to the terminal - it looks like byobu/tmux blocks them.\n\nA: UPDATE: April 10, 2015\nMy current solution that does not depend on the use of shell or terminal is to use wmctrl from a script, and place full path to the script in .byoburc . Works with gnome-terminal, terminator, sakura - just about any termimal\nHere's the script:\n#!/bin/bash\n# Description: byobu always has string \") - byobu\" in it's window title\n# like user@hostname (192.168.0.2) - byobu\n# So why not find windows with exact same string, and tell wmctrl to\n# set the title for us ? That's all we do here\n\nBYOBU_WINDOW=$( wmctrl -lx | awk '/) - byobu/ {print $1}' )\nsleep 0.5\nwmctrl -ir $BYOBU_WINDOW -N \"MYTITLEHERE\"\n\nOriginal post\nAs far as gnome-terminal goes, you can set profile preferences to keep the initial title specified in the profile settings. Bellow is the screenshot of my byuobu with keep the initial title option, and with replace initial title option\n\n\nAs for Terminator, I'll download and see if same applies to it.\n\nA: i have found that byobu uses tmux in the back end.\nand tmux does have some ways to set the terminal title with the following lines in .byoubu/.tmux.conf:\nset -g set-titles on\nset -g set-titles-string \"#(pwd)\"\n\nwhere #(pwd) sets it to the working directory the range of options can be found in the man page of tmux under the formats section\ndigging a little deeper it seems that byobu by default comments exactly these two lines out in /usr/share/byobu/profiles/tmux to set its own custom title\n", "Q: Juju Charm branding guidelines Are there any branding guidelines available related to the trademarks \"Juju\" and \"Charm\"?\nI'm looking for details on how the terms \"Juju\" and \"Charm\" can or cannot be used in documentation.\nCan I say something like \"product X has been charmed\" or \"charming of the product X is underway\". \n\nA: Disclaimer: I am not a lawyer.

(Ubuntu Server Trusty) I have configured Ubuntu Server for my needs, and basically everything is working as I want. I'm new to Linux, but learned a lot using and interpreting different guides, however, this particular problem gives me headache. As I don't want to mess up permissions, etc, I would like to ask for your help.\nI use latest Webmin. I can easily create a new user (I also used command line with my default user as well). I can login with ssh with ssh test@ip, I have the user's home dir, but I just can't execute any commands, like ls, ifconfig, nothing. I read that I should use relative paths, etc. but what I want is to achieve that the new user has the same abilities as default like the user a configured on installing Ubuntu, and use as default. I read also that a bash needs to be configured with some PATH variables, but I don't understand that part.\nMy default user that works perfectly well is 'server'. Let's say I create a new user 'test'. Can zou guide me step-by-step how next?\nAlso, if I want that the new user 'test' has access to my files created by user 'server' and also 'server' to the files created by user 'test' I need to add user 'test' to the group of user 'server'?\nMany thanks!\n\nA: The correct way to create new user is by using the adduser binary (it covers everything from user password to group and home folder creation, thanks to @muru @Takkat for pointing this out, Man Page of the command):\n ubuntu@ip:/$ sudo adduser testuser\n Adding user `testuser' ...\n Adding new group `testuser' (1003) ...\n Adding new user `testuser' (1002) with group `testuser' ...\n Creating home directory `/home/testuser' ...\n Copying files from `/etc/skel' ...\n Enter new UNIX password:\n Retype new UNIX password:\n passwd: password updated successfully\n Changing the user information for testuser\n Enter the new value, or press ENTER for the default\n         Full Name []: \n         Room Number []:\n         Work Phone []:\n         Home Phone []:\n         Other []:\n Is the information correct? [Y/n] Y\n\nThis will create the user named testuser and give them their own home directory in /home/testuser. The files in the new home directory are copied from the /etc/skel folder, which contains default home directory files. If you wanted to set default values for your users, you would do so by modifying or adding files in that directory. If you want your new user to have same environment as server user just copy these files from server home directory to testuser home directory (make sure after you copy them that each one of them have testuser as owner chown testuser:testuser .bash_profile etc.):\n.bash_profile .bashrc .inputrc .mkshrc .profile\n\nAnd yes, if you want both users to have access to their files and folder you have to add each of them to the other users group:\nadduser server testuser\nadduser testuser server\n\nWhat the user can access is determined of the folder/file permissions for that group (for example in order user testuser to read and write file test.txt in server's home folder it has to have at least permissions of 760). You can view the permissions by excuting\n$ ls -al\ndrwxrwxr-x   3 server server    4096 Jun 14 10:11 test.txt\n\n\n", "Q: How to obtain frame rate of video as a fraction?

I totally had 4 drives C, F, G, H. I installed Ubuntu as dual boot with windows 8.1. Now my only problem is that, I can't access F drive because I installed Ubuntu on that drive.\nMy question is => am I able to get my F drive(files) back or is it lost. Is there any chance of getting that drive by uninstalling ubuntu?.  \nIf yes, how can I uninstall Ubuntu. Or Even by using ubuntu alongside how can I get my files(F drive) back. \n\nA: If you've picked an existing partition to install a new OS on, then it will have overwritten that partition & put all it's own files there. This means that the partition has been, in effect, removed & replaced, and formatted, and data written to it.\nThe old partition most likely had data stored toward the beginning of it; depending on your luck, historical usage, and amount of space used, it is possible that some data might have survived even this treatment! If there wasn't much prior use of the drive then you're likely out of luck by now.\nThe odds of getting much back are thin; however, if there was important stuff there, you could try the following:\nReboot from a live system, ie CD or USB.\nDownload a forensic tool such as testdisk, or foremost - I use foremost, and the other question referenced above, used testdisk, so I'll talk about foremost:\nRun this, using a partition other than the target to store found data - an external drive is good - with the target as your old 'F' drive.\nType in foremost -o /path_to_destination_storage -i /dev/sda4, replacing sda4 with the correct designation for your old 'F' drive.\nThis will produce a mess of randomly named files, classed by type, representing the files it found and recognised including the \"blank\" parts of the drive which not not be as blank as expected!\nYou can then set about playing found media, viewing pictures, searching text files, to see if you got anything back.\n\nA: When you install Ubuntu on a drive, it will format the drive. That means you lose all data at this step. \nSo in your case, sorry I have to say that you cannot get back your data.\n\nEDIT by ByteCommander: It is theoretically possible (but difficult) to recover data of a formatted partition, but once it got overwritten with other data (which it did during the Ubuntu installation - at least parts of it) it is gone to the nirwana.\n", "Q: tftpd-hpa installation failed in ubuntu software center \nthe full error is here.\n$sudo apt-get install tftpd-hpa\n\n   [sudo] password for ashokkrishna: \nReading package lists...

With the second command, which forces nslookup to use google DNS everything looks ok.\nMost proxies that ISPs run are set to cache content only on a single port, port 80, so you will maybe get lucky by using a different port. According to this no-ip dynamic updater uses port 80, port 443 and port 8245. So change \nhttp://dynupdate.no-ip.com/nic/update\n\nto\nhttp://dynupdate.no-ip.com:8245/nic/update\n\nIn your router configuration.

How can one protect oneself from such attacks?\n\nA: *\n\n*It never rarely happens in Ubuntu, because:\n\n\n*\n\n*all the most of the trojans and remote spy tools are programmed for windows systems.\n\n*If anyone infects you with one of these tools for Linux, it will be interested particularly by you, and will take a very hard work to hack your Linux computer.\n\n\n1.1. There is a good collection of fake apps and other resources with malware in Android devices, however, being careful and taking care of the per app permissions shouldn't be any trouble. \n1.2. A good advice for both (Ubuntu and Android) is don't try to download miraculous applications from unknown sources or click on fraud ads.\n\n*The best hardware solution if you're worried is a good piece of paper or a bit of insulating tape. However I worked with Linux 8 years and never had a malware (except self-developed for fun).\n\n*The most of the websites with linux virus alarms are websites authored or contributed by windows users which had white hair of the many scares of main antivirus companies. ;-)\n", "Q: I'm certain Ubuntu doesn't recognise that I have two GPUs The possible duplicate is regarding multiple monitor setups and intergrated GPUs, so it's unfortunately not at all relevant.\nI use two GeForce GTX 780 Phantom GPUs, and I've never had a trouble running a single game. Recently that's changed, since reinstalling Steam and playing games on Linux. I use the v349.12 Edgers drivers which has definitely helped performance. However in system settings it only lists a single graphics card. I remember on Windows it always listed both cards, with a '1' or '2' appended to the end of each. Given the performance of some games, I'm sure Linux doesn't see both of them.\nAs always, any help is much appreciated. Thanks.\n\n\nA: I wouldn't use that dialogue as an indication of anything.\nIt's just a pretty screen with high-level info.\nI'd suggest using vendor-issued tools like nvidia-settings (GUI) or nvidia-smi (CLI) to work out what's there.

The system partition on the other computer was sda1 and on my computer its sda4 (I have a multiboot system with windows, MBR, UEFI, SWAP on the other sda's). \nAfter installing the image my computer cannot boot anymore since grub cannot find the new Ubuntu 14.04 on sda4. Unfortunatly I cannot run boot-repair neither from a stick nor from within an Ubuntu live session.\nDoes anyone know how to repair my grub?\nHere is the first part of the output of the boot repair error log file:\nBoot Info Script e7fc706 + Boot-Repair extra info      [Boot-Info 9Feb2015]\n\n\n============================= Boot Info Summary: ===============================\n\n => Grub2 (v1.99-2.00) is installed in the MBR of /dev/sda and looks at sector \n    386664576 of the same hard drive for core.img, but core.img can not be \n    found at this location.\n => No boot loader is installed in the MBR of /dev/sdb.\n => Syslinux MBR (4.04 and higher) is installed in the MBR of /dev/sdc.\n => Syslinux MBR (4.04 and higher) is installed in the MBR of /dev/sdh.\n\nsda1: __________________________________________________________________________\n\n    File system:       vfat\n    Boot sector type:  Windows 7/2008: FAT32\n    Boot sector info:  No errors found in the Boot Parameter Block.\n    Operating System:  \n    Boot files:        /EFI/Boot/bkpbootx64.efi /EFI/Boot/bootx64.efi \n                       /EFI/ubuntu/grubx64.efi /EFI/ubuntu/shimx64.efi \n                       /EFI/Microsoft/Boot/bkpbootmgfw.efi \n                       /EFI/Microsoft/Boot/bootmgfw.efi \n                       /EFI/Microsoft/Boot/bootmgr.efi \n                       /EFI/Microsoft/Boot/bootx64.efi \n                       /EFI/Microsoft/Boot/memtest.efi\n\nsda2: __________________________________________________________________________\n\n    File system:       \n    Boot sector type:  -\n    Boot sector info: \n    Mounting failed:   mount: unknown filesystem type ''\n\nsda3: __________________________________________________________________________\n\n    File system:       ntfs\n    Boot sector type:  Windows 7/2008: NTFS\n    Boot sector info:  No errors found in the Boot Parameter Block.\n    Operating System:  Windows 7\n    Boot files:        /Windows/System32/winload.exe\n\nsda4: __________________________________________________________________________\n\n    File system:       ext4\n    Boot sector type:  -\n    Boot sector info: \n    Operating System:  Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS \n    Boot files:        /boot/grub/grub.cfg /etc/fstab \n                       /boot/grub/i386-pc/core.img\n\nsda5: __________________________________________________________________________\n\n    File system:       swap\n    Boot sector type:  -\n    Boot sector info: \n\n\nA: It looks like the source computer, at least, used EFI. If the new computer also uses EFI, you should be able to use my rEFInd boot manager as an emergency boot system:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the CD-R or USB flash drive version from the downloads page.\n\n*Prepare a boot medium from said image.\n\n*Boot rEFInd. This may require using your computer's built-in boot manager, typically accessed via a function key.\n\n*rEFInd should show you options for all your Linux kernels. Select one and hit the Enter key.\n\n\nWith any luck the computer will start up. You can then either install rEFInd via the Debian package or PPA or run Boot Repair.\nIf you have problems, you may need to boot an emergency system and edit your /etc/fstab file for your new system, since it's possible your filesystem UUIDs have changed. The easiest thing to do in this case is to change the first entry for your / line to read /dev/sda4 rather than UUID={whatever}. With a little more effort, you can use blkid to learn the new UUID value(s) and make the appropriate substitutions.\n", "Q: Malware from rdsrv.com on Google Chrome I am continuously getting popups from rdsrv.com on Google Chrome. I am on Ubuntu 14.04. I tried resetting browser, and uninstalling every extension, but still have the popups.\n\nA: I would try to confirm that it is indeed Google Chrome itself causing the problem. When you see the popup, try running\nsudo netstat -taup | grep rdsrv.com\nIf the request is indeed coming from chrome, than try another reinstall, but use purge if you have not already. Also, make sure you are installing it from the offical repository. \nsudo apt-get purge google-chrome-stable && sudo apt-get autoremove && sudo apt-get clean && sudo apt-get install google-chrome-stable\nThe purge option will make sure that all remnants of the old install are removed. You may wish to check your system's integrity with tools such as clamav, rkhunter, or chkrootkit, but usually all you will get are false positives. If the problem still persists after a full reinstall, perhaps try the open source chromium-browser instead. Personally, I think it's better.  \nYou may also want to try installing the Ablock-Plus and ScriptBlock plugins to prevent these kinds of things from happening in the first place. \nAlso try connecting to a different network and see if the problem persists. Perhaps you are behind an infected router. I see that the domain in question belongs to godaddy.com so you could inform them about this abuse case. If none of that works, please report back. \n\nA: The problem is in the router not the computer. The DNS has been changed from service provider set to the DNS address set in the router. Reset the router to defaults and the set up to your ISP settings. \nTo reset router, with power on put paperclip or similar in the reset hole and hold the reed swwitch down for ten seconds.\n", "Q: Ubuntu Network manager I uninstalled network-manager from my Ubuntu-gnome, so I don't have internet connection.

Actually you don't need network-manager at all to save your network configurations, you can use save the contents in /etc/network/interfaces file to be read by ifupdown upon boot so the network will be configured properly.\nIf you want to install NetworkManager after setting up the network, run the command:\nsudo apt-get install network-manager\n\n\nA: You can find the package here http://packages.ubuntu.com/trusty/network-manager\nIt is source only though so you need to build it you self\nPlease see the following link on building from source as it is too much to copy here https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CompilingEasyHowTo\n", "Q: No sound driver in GNOME sound applet I cannot see anymore any sound device in the GNOME sound applet, after updating Ubuntu 14.04 (the update contained the kernel 3.13.0-49).

I have re-installed Lubuntu 14.10 on my laptop (eee pc 701),but if I want to remove anything, he will also remove the package \"lubuntu-desktop\". Is it safe to remove?\n\nA: Yes, it's safe to remove. It's a \"metapackage\":\n\nOne of the handy features of apt (the packaging system used by Ubuntu)\n  is the use of metapackages. These packages do not contain actual\n  software, they simply depend on other packages to be installed. This\n  setup allows entire sets of software to be installed by selecting only\n  the appropriate metapackage. For example, an Ubuntu user can install\n  the Kubuntu environment (KDE and all its associated programs) by\n  selecting \"kubuntu-desktop.\"  \n\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/MetaPackages\nBecause one or more of the packages you are uninstalling are a dependency of the lubuntu-desktop package, it will need to be removed as well. But removing the lubuntu-desktop package itself won't break anything since it doesn't contain any actual software.\nYou can see more information about the package (such as which packages it depends on) by running this command in a terminal:\napt-cache show lubuntu-desktop\n\n\nA: I believe that Lubuntu-desktop is a metapackage.

I have opened an image with LibreOffice Draw. I would like to draw a free line on that image, that is to push the mouse button, drag the mouse around, and have the computer track my movements and draw a curve on the image accordingly, until I release the button. Everywhere I search I see \"use the curve tool\" (or specifically its \"freeform line\" sub-tool), but the curve tool smoothes my curve, so that I end up with something quite different to what I actually draw. It makes it quite difficult to draw letter shapes, for example.\nIs there a way to have Draw just draw what I draw, without any smoothing or other effects?\n\nA: Using the Freeform Line tool sound like the best tool in Libreoffice for what you want to do, whilst the Curve tool may be more precise but slower to use.\nIf you want to edit the curve after adding it, use the Edit points tool.\nYou may want to use a program designed more for this called Inkscape, which has more tools available. You can then use the resulting SVG file and edit it within Draw, or insert a exported image (e.g. PNG) version.\n\nA: The quickest solution I found was thanks to anon58192932's comment here below.

But now it affects only Firefox.\nUPDATE #2\nWell, it's not only in Firefox =)\n\nA: Based on the information available in your question this can be a very broad range of things. I am going to list the ones that come to mind!\n\n\n*\n\n*You have selected a custom system font file that does not adhere to standards. Solution: revert to the default system font or find another without bugs.\n\n*The font file is corrupt. This is not likely since you say it occurs from time to time. Solution: Replace it with an original fetched online. Rebuild font caches.\n\n*There is a version conflict in the chain of libraries that are responsible for rendering your fonts. Solution: sudo update; sudo upgrade; sudo reboot; usually does the trick. Also if you have a lot of PPAs installed, I would disable them together with software installed from them temporarily to see if the problem goes away.\n\n*One of the font rendering libraries has a bug. This could manifest itself as some glyphs not being rendered properly like in your screen-shot. Solution: Reinstall font rendering packages.\n\n*The font rendering library's cache is corrupt. Font rendering is an expensive/slow operation and it is customary to use caches of rendered bitmaps that are dynamically managed at run-time to speed this up. Should the memory or disk-space required for this cache not have sufficient security privileges, run out space, become corrupted due to hardware faults then this would make font rendering look ugly. Solution: Rebuild font caches with this: sudo fc-cache -srv; fc-cache -rv\n\n*Hardware accelerated font rendering will rely on both the GPU and its driver. The GPU driver may have a bug or you are having hardware problems with your GPU that manifest themselves as errors in font rendering. Typically GPUs will start malfunctioning \"a little\" when they are under stress, overheat or in some cases when they don't receive enough power from the PSU. Solution: make sure your system is not overheating. Make sure your PSU is scaled to handle your GPU. There are utilities that can help you stress-test your GPU to see if this produces your problem.\n\n*Memory chips have faults that manifest as memory corruptions. If this is the case you may also experience instability. If a memory chip gets just one bit wrong every 4 days this can manifest itself as really hard to track errors. Solution: run memtest86 or similar memory testing tools to verify that your chips are fine.\n\n*Individual applications may have bugs that manifest themselves like your screen-shot. Especially applications that are text and font intense such as web-browsers. I have seen this myself in Firefox. At one time all letters were exchanged for small filled boxes. Solution: restart app or system if it happens seldom. Update software version if it happens often.\n\n*Firmware bugs is a reality, especially in low end hardware. Also bugs in firmware are often masked over in the WINDOWS drivers. For Linux users this means we get to keep the firmware bugs for free. Solution: If you got your computer for cheaps, or it is from a vendor not known for it's focus on stability/Linux support then maybe you should start saving for a new system.\n\n\nHope at least some of this was of use. I really had a great time writing it!\n\nA: Try This before shaking ur computers Nervous system!!\nTo get KDE to display GTK apps well, you really need the ~/.gtkrc-2.0-kde4 theming that kubuntu-default-settings adds. Installing this will likely change your bootup logo to Kubuntu's though, so expect that. (You will obviously need kcm-gtk as well.)\nYou get all those packages when you install Kubuntu, but if you're just trying to install minimum-level KDE packages you'll have to fix it yourself.\nWhenever you change font settings in KDE, it first saves the changes in the normal KDE settings file ~/.kde/share/config/kdeglobals that all KDE and KDE settings-aware programs read, and then also saves basic font settings (autoaliasing, hinting etc) in ~/.fonts.conf, for apps that don't have good KDE integration. What I guess is happening here is that the .fonts.conf settings transfer to your GNOME session. So, delete or rename it.\nCode:\n$ mv ~/.fonts.conf ~/.fonts.conf.bak\n\n\nA: Nothing hard to fix this problem. There might be some upgrades failed to install or failed on half way progress. So you might want to upgrade your KDE or install it again to fix this problem. It happened to me when I used to upgrade font packages with kde file manager.\n\nA: kUBUNTU 16.04.\nSame problem, when i disconnect a monitor and reconnect again or when i change to shell(CTRL+ALT+F1) and go back to graphical interface (CTRL+ALT+F7).\nSafe way.\n1-Close all gtk applications.\n2-Go to systemsettings --> Applications Style --> Style GNOME(GTK) ---> Change font size or change font to any different of default(Noto Sans), use this configuration until next reboot.\nA dangerous way.\nAnother way is disable/enable the default(Noto Sans) font, but i tried this and broke everything was difficult restore to default configuration.\n\nA: Normally, this might just be a problem of the original font file. You can re-download the font family from this direct link: \nhttp://font.ubuntu.com/download/ubuntu-font-family-0.80.zip\nand then from there just re-install the entire font family.

My concern is that most \"live\" distros have far better hardware detection that is run during boot time that I would lose with a full installation.  \nI want this installation to be as \"universally\" compatible as possible with whatever hardware I encounter. I'm assuming something needs to change from the standard install and I'm also guessing I'll need to pull down a lot of drivers too, but I am unsure how to do this.\nIs there a way to configure a standard Ubuntu install to run the hardware detection at boot time similar to how a live distro does this?\n\nA: I've run similar installations on a very wide variety of hardware without difficulty. Unlike Windows, the vast majority of hardware you'll encounter is already has \"baked in\" support in the kernel. While I don't usually get maximum resolution out of video cards/displays (as this often requires proprietary drivers), I've always ended up with a usable system regardless of the hardware I've thrown at it. I use installations such as this for troubleshooting, testing, cloning drives and making images, data recovery and etc. For my purposes this approach has worked fine. Your use case may require a different approach, but I doubt it. You may find this helpful once you've decided to take the plunge.

I have a PC with 4 CPUs that is running four jobs. I would like to run another job on it, but only when one of the CPUs becomes available. Is there simple command to do this (I know this is what cluster management systems do, but there should be a simpler solution?)?\n\nA: http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/trusty/man2/nice.2.html\nNice allows you to change the priority of a process.\ne.g\nnice 19 yourprogram\n\nWould run yourprogram with the lowest priority, meaning that it will only run when no other [higher] processes are running.\n\nA: The batch command from the at package schedules jobs to be run when the system load average drops below a set threshold, which defaults to 1.5.  Since you have 4 cpus, you might want to add -l 4 to the command in /etc/init/at.conf to up that limit to 4 instead of 1.5.\n", "Q: Migrating linux systems to VMware using rsync Hello there :) As stated in the title, I am trying to migrate linux systems that I have to a virtual environment. I tried Vmware's tools such as converter standalone but that proved troublesome since the space requirements were sub-optimal. I discussed the issue before in this thread.\nI will be using rsync to migrate the files, including the operating system. The source pc has this partitions.\nI just want the system to boot and to work, I don't really care how, as for space needed on the destination systems, that doesn't matter either, I just need them to work :) \nAs far as my issue here is, I have created a VMware image and I booted into a tool that would permit me to create the partitions, but honestly, I don't know how. I am still learning linux and the use of the command line so I might be stuck on something stupid. As the good man in the thread I linked to mentioned, I don't need LVM, but I don't honestly know what I need :) \nSo if at all possible, I want to know how to do this and if anything's not clear (I tend to talk a lot and make less sense, so apologies for that), then by all means ask and hopefully you guys can help.\nRegards\n\nA: I propose you to try the following approach:\n\n\n*\n\n*On the server for new VM's download Rescatux ISO.\n\n*Create the VM for the first server and make sure it has a virtual machine disk image attached (VMDI from now on).\n\n*Attach the disk of your Physical Server (PSD for now on) and the Rescatux ISO.\n\n*Set VM to boot from this ISO. And start it.\n\n*Select \"Rescatux auto detect\" from the menu and after loading run GParted.\n\n*You'll have listed 2 disks on the top right corner combo box /dev/sda & /dev/sdb one for the VMDI and one for your PSD.\n\n*On the combo box select the PSD entry. The partitions on that disk will display below. Also check the \"View menu\" and see the \"Device information\". Take note.\n\n*Now select the VMDI entry and replicate the partitioning scheme your PSD has (top left corner, sheet icon).\n\n*IMPORTANT: The \"boot\" partition is recommended to not be smaller than 250MB. You can identify it on your PSD because it is marked with the \"boot\" flag, and is probably the partition at the top of the list.\n\n*When done partitioning, click the green mark icon to apply all your changes. \n\n*You can now set up all the \"flags\" needed (such as \"boot\") by right clicking the newly created partition. You can exit GParted.\n\n*Mount both disk's PSD & VMDI on the file manager and.\n\n*Rsync is probably not installed, so open a terminal and run sudo apt-get install rsync.\n\n*Run rsync '/mnt/source/partition/' '/mnt/new/partition/' (I don't know hot to use rsync sorry). You can also do this steep by running rsync on your Physical Server, but you will have to configure the network before. Double and triple check source and target so you don't mess up stuff.\n\n\nWhen done copying files from each partition we can say the disk has been cloned. But at this point if you reboot and boot from VMDI it wont run.\n\n\n*Shutdown the VM, eject PSD (just to be sure things wont mess up). Boot from Rescatux again.\n\n*Select \"Rescatux auto detect\" once loaded, select \"Grub\" > \"Restore Grub\" > \"Restore Grub!!!\"\n\n*Choose the correct disk and press \"OK\"\n\n*You are set, can shutdown, detach Rescatux ISO and boot your new VM.\n\n", "Q: What folder contains the Wallpapers for 14.04 Trying to find the folder that contains the Wallpapers for 14.04, I want to use some of them on my other computers.\n\nA: They're located in\n/usr/share/backgrounds\n\n", "Q: What layout/files should debian repository have? I'm java developer. My goal is to wrap my objects into deb files / upload them to a private repository and install them from this repository.\nSo my questions are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is Debian repository just an HTTP file storage that fulfill some specific rules?\n\n*What are the rules & the structure which are used to store packages? \n\n*Is it enough to add deb http://my-repository.com stable non-free\nto /etc/apt/sources.list to use this repository?\n\n\nA: *\n\n*Is Debian repository just an HTTP file storage that fulfill some specific rules?\nYes, but it can also be an FTP storage or just a local directory.\n\n\n*What are the rules & the structure which are used to store packages?\nDebian Wiki: Debian Repository Format documents the structure of the official Debian repository and the format that is officially understood by clients.\n\n\n*Is it enough to add deb http://my-repository.com stable non-free to /etc/apt/sources.list to use this repository?\nYes but it depends on how you set up you repository. However the simplest is to setup a flat repository which have same setup as the trivial archive/repository (local directory)\n\n*\n\n*Better to create a folder for each release, ex: trusty.\n\n\n*Copy your Debian packages into it.\n\n\n*Generate package list (run it from its parent directory):\n dpkg-scanpackages -m trusty /dev/null | gzip -9c > ./trusty/Packages.gz\n\n\n\n*Upload the whole folder to your site\n\n\n*Now you can access it by adding the repository in this format:\n deb http://my-repository.com trusty/\n\nNote: / is a must here, as trusty is directory in this setup.\nUpdate Note (2021-05-28): What's next?\nThat above will be somehow okay in a confined/closed private network. But publishing Debian packages into the public need more safety measures like:\n\n*\n\n*Signing: each package release file (while building), repository package lists\n\n*And publish the public key from key pair used for signing so user can add it to APT.\n\nHere is a Debian page with good overview about Secure APT\n", "Q: Copy pictures recursively from one folder to the root of another? So, I have a Windows virtual machine running this certain program. The details are as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*The program has no recursive search functionality.\n\n*I have lots of free disk space.\n\n*I have excess junk in my pictures folder. (I just want to copy the pictures, assume I have pictures ranging every known picture file extension (excluding archives))\n\n*I want to use the command line to scan for every picture in my home directory recursively, and copy all of them to the current directory WITHOUT creating sub folders that match my pictures folder. (Ex: ~/cyndaquil.png is copied to ./cyndaquil.png, while ~/foo/bar/quilava.png is copies to ./quilava.png. Also, my home directory is a mess.)\n\n\nSo, is there any command I can use to do this?\n\nA: This will copy (will, echo) all the files that the file command thinks is some kind of image:  \nfor i in $(find . -type f -print0 | xargs -0 file | grep \" image \" | cut -d: -f1 ) ; do echo cp \"$i\" $PWD; done\n\n\nA: If you do not care about name collisions (foo/bar/name1 vs foo/other/name1 (but see man cp for --backup=numbered), you could read man find to see what this does:  \nfind $HOME -type f -iname '*.png' -exec cp --backup=numbered {} $PWD \\;\n\n", "Q: What do I need to do to get Software Updater to work though I'm connected and can browse the internet?

It lists the us.ubuntu.com links six times and lists them in pairs saying main restricted, universe and multiverse.\n\nA: Please click the \"check\" box, which is next to the \"update\" box.  Sometimes that detangles the updater.  \n\nA: More than a year late I know but I have just had exactly this problem and in my case fortunately the Software Updater was just giving a bad error message. The message that it can't connect to the internet should actually say that it can't access some of the PPAs in your Software & Updates - Other Software list. \nClick on the error message's details link and you'll see which one(s) is/are causing issues. \nNow go into the Software and Updates dialog, and uncheck the bad PPAs in the Other Software list. It'll demand your root password. \nThen close it and the Software Updater should run fine. \nObviously it won't update the software that came from that PPA, so you'll have to look into that yourself (if you need it updating).\n", "Q: Do I need to install Security updates for Ubuntu base? I installed Lubuntu 14.04 LTS from a disc and have added updates.System info shows 14.04.2 LTS. Software updater >security updates offers Ubuntu base 103MB. Do I need to install this?\n\nA: It is important to install the latest security updates to help protect your system.\nUbuntu base is the collective name for the tools and services and core parts of the Operating System and the following applies equally to any software installed, including what is categorised as Ubuntu based as mentioned in the question.\nThere are situations where NOT installing security updates may be favourable, but these cases must be evaluated on an individual basis and beyond scope of this question, therefore we should fall back to the official advice from https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades\n\nKeeping your computer's software up to date is the single most\n  important task for protecting your system. Ubuntu can alert you to\n  pending updates, and also be configured to apply updates\n  automatically. Security updates for Ubuntu are announced via Ubuntu\n  Security Notices (USNs).\n\nThe Security Teams Update Procedure page has a little info on what the secruity updates are (to help understand why they are considered important):\n\nWe only fix bugs in our stable releases which truly affect overall\n  system security, i. e. which enable an attacker to circumvent the\n  permissions configured on the system, or are a threat to the user's\n  data in any way. Most common examples:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Buffer overflow in a server process which allows to crash it (denial of service) and/or to execute attacker provided code\n  (privilege escalation).\n  \n*Insecure temporary file handling which allows race condition and symlink attacks to delete unrelated files with the invoker's\n  privileges.\n  \n*Non-working security-relevant configuration options (e. g. iptables would allow packets which should be blocked, or a server's ACL option\n  does not do the right thing).\n  \n*Less critical bugs (like Denial of Service vulnerabilities in instant messengers or email applications) are also fixed usually, but\n  with lower priority.\n  \n\n\nA: Not installing security updates creates a situation in which hackers can use your machine to tamper with your data and use your machine to attack others.\nFor example, an operating system that is using OpenSSL that has not been updated can be tampered with and cause your data to be leaked.\n", "Q: How to install from two .ISO images? I mount the first one, run the Setup (it's a Windows program), and when it asks for DISC 2, I try to unmount the ISO, but it says it can't be unmounted because it's busy, which is obvious.\nIn Windows, you can unmount the disc while the Setup is still running. My question is if there's any workaround this and mount the second image while the setup is still running?\nThank you.\n\nA: Just mount both images at the same time, there's no real need to unmount the first one.\n\nOn a side note: the problem is probably the fact that wine itself is preventing the image to be unmounted, overriding the specific executable's default behavior which wouldn't.\n", "Q: Some default fonts different between two 14.04 installations I just installed Ubuntu on a couple new computers, and a lot of the system fonts are quite different than those of the first laptop. All are running 14.04, all are fully up to date with updates, all have default font settings. And yet, they look markedly different. \nNote: I just discovered that if I login as a guest user on the problematic computer, all the fonts look exactly as I would hope. So obviously it's a user-level setting somewhere, I just can't figure out which one it is so I can reset it.\nHere are the \"good\" fonts from the original laptop:\nNautilus\n\nAnd the Ubuntu taskbar (see time, my name) and the chrome taskbar.\n\nNow compare these images with the ones taken from my current PC. Look especially at the \"Home\" button in the top left corner, and the text of each folder and at the date/time/name located in the taskbar top right corner. These are not the same fonts, though Ubuntu claims they are.\n\nUbuntu taskbar\n\nFor the record, both computers show the following as their font settings:\n\nHow can I figure out how to get these same fonts working in the new PC? I have tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*resetting fonts with unity-tweak-tool\n\n*Using a different monitor\n\n*Using a different monitor cable (VGA instead of HDMI)\n\n*rebooting\n\n\nSorta at my wits end.\n\nA: Try deleting:\n\n~/.config/fontconfig/fonts.conf\n\nSome times font preferences are stored there and this place is not affected by tweak tools like Ubuntu and Unity tweak tools, these don't even show what is stored there.\n\nA: So a lot of time has passed, and I still intermittently get this issue with my desktop. What I've discovered is that logging out entirely and logging back in often fixes the issue (not rebooting, though). It's definitely some user settings getting mucked with, just still not sure which ones.\n", "Q: Does 'g_thread_join' delete 'gpointer data'? From the reference manual: \"g_thread_join() consumes the reference to the passed-in thread . This will usually cause the GThread struct and associated resources to be freed.\"\nDoes 'g_thread_join' call delete on 'gpointer data' passed to 'g_thread_create/g_thread_new'? Or is the manual just talking about freeing the 4 or 8 bytes that the gpointer itself is occupying?\n\nA: This gives a clue:\n\nThis will usually cause the GThread struct and associated resources to be freed.\n\nFrom the manual (g_thread_join()):\n\nUse g_thread_ref() to obtain an extra reference if you want to keep the GThread alive beyond the g_thread_join() call.\n\nThis means that the thread is killed, unless (and that explains the \"usually\") you keep a reference to it before the call.\n", "Q: Starting Steam games by typing the path - where are they? I use/./usr/bin/applicationname to launch programs using terminal, but steam games (and steam) don't show up in it, although I can put a steam game in my favorite applications list. Is there any way to find it?\n\nA: Steam games are installed by default in directories under /home/<user>/.steam/steam/steamapps/common, where <user> is your username. For example, if you have Europa Universalis IV installed, you can start it from the terminal using /home/<user>/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/Europa\\ Universalis\\ IV/eu4.\nThe Steam binary is located by default at /usr/games/steam. It should be in your $PATH (the shell variable defining the places that the shell searches for binaries), so you can find it using which steam and you can run it by simply entering steam.\n\nA: Thanks, I've figured it out now. For anyone else who wants to do this, you type ls ~/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/<name of app you want to launch>.\nI saw a few files, two of which were <app name>.x86 and <app name>.x86_64\nThe latter one worked for me, but I think the other one would work for 32 bit applications.\n", "Q: RTL8192EE PCIe Wireless issues I have a ThinkPad T450s that drop out of a wifi connexion after few seconds.\nSometimes, I can't even connect to the network.

On the terminal, I used this command:\nstat Downloads\n\nIt stated the permissions for my downloads folder were \"drwxr-xr-x\"\nWouldn't this mean only the admin and owner would be able to edit the folder?\nHow would the browser download something and put it in the folder if it does not have the permission, or does Ubuntu detect that you allowed the browser to do so?\n\nA: Programs run with the privileges of the user who invoked them.\nSo when you launch your browser, the browser process has the rights you have to read, modify and execute files.\nAnd as you are the owner of your Downloads folder, your user account has (usually by default) full read/write/execute rights. Therefore your browser has them too.\nTo clarify the stat output (d rwx r-x r-x):\n\n\n*\n\n*The first letter (here: d) describes the type of the file system object you are examining. d means that you are showing the permissions of a directory. If you are examining a file, you will get a - instead. There are other possibilities too, like l for a link. Further there are (according to @Atsby's comment) b for block devices, c for character devices, p for pipes and probably even more...\nSee * for note about directory permissions!\n\n*The first three letters rwx stand for the owner's permissions. A letter means that the respective access type is granted, a \"-\" means denied. --> full access\n\n*The second three letters r-x represent the permissions users have who are members of the owner's group. It's the same \"rwx\"-format as above. --> only read and execute permissions, no writing\n\n*The last three letters r-x represent the permissions of any other users who is not the owner itself and is not a member of the owner group. Still same \"rwx\"-format. --> also only read and execute permissions, no writing\n* Directory permissions:\nNote that directory permissions have different meanings than file permissions. For directories...\nread access (r) means listing the files (ls command),\nwrite access (w) means changing the directory content (creating, deleting, renaming files) and\nexecute access (x) means entering the directory (cd command or opening with the file manager)\n\nAdvanced execute permissions:\nSometimes you find an S, s, T or t where you would expect an x. \nThere are SUID (Set User ID) and SGID (Set Group ID) permissions which replace the normal x if the file should always be executed with the permissions of its owner (SUID) or its owner group (SGID). For SUID, the x of the user permissions (first block) gets replaced, for SGID, the x of the group permissions (second block) gets replaced. A capital letter S stands for a - (permission denied) while a small s equals to x (permission granted).\nIf the x of the third block (others' permissions) gets replaced by a T/t, this means that the \"Sticky Bit\" is set. Nowadays, it is mostly used to prevent deletion of the file by non-owner users who have write permissions. Again, a capital letter T equals a - (no execute permission for others) without \"Sticky Bit\", while a small t stands for granted execution access (x) for others.\n\nOctal notation:\nThe permissions can also be represented by 3-4 digits (values 0-8), which is called octal notation.\nNormally you have 3 digits or 4 digits with the first digit set to 0 (e.g. 755 or 0755). \n\n\n*\n\n*The first digit (which can be omitted if it is 0) represents the advanced permission flags. Flag values: SUID=4, SGID=2, Sticky=1.\n\n*The second digit represents the state of the owner's permission flags (rwx; first permission block in string formatting). Flag values: r=4, w=2, x=1.\n\n*The third digit represents the state of the owner group's permission flags (rwx; second permission block in string formatting). Flag values: r=4, w=2, x=1.\n\n*The fourth digit represents the state of all other's permission flags (rwx; third permission block in string formatting). Flag values: r=4, w=2, x=1.\n\n\nTo calculate the digit value, just sum up the flag values of all set flags. Examples: rwx=4+2+1=7, r-x=4+0+1=5\n\n Source and additional references:\nhttp://www.zzee.com/solutions/linux-permissions.shtml\nhttp://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=1822622&seqNum=6\nPlease visit those links for more detail, especially about advanced permissions.\n", "Q: Running a windows screensaver via wine I'm trying to get Free Fire Screensaver to run on my Kubuntu 14.10 machine. I've managed to install it under wine and now have an .exe file to start the fire effect (which works exactly as it should, go wine!). However I am at a loss as to how I can get Kubuntu to use it as a screensaver.

I want to list all the log files which do not belong to today and only the files that contain 2015 in their names. \nThese are the commands I have tried:\nfind . -name 2015 -mtime +1 -exec  ls -ltrh  {} \\;\n\nfind . -name *2015* -mtime +1 -exec  ls -ltrh  {} \\;\n\nThe output from both is nothing, but still, files are there. Something is wrong with these commands, and I am not getting what. Any help would be appreciated.\n\nA: The command find . -name '*2015*' -mmin +1440 -ls will probably do what you want. See below for details.\nYour first command had -name 2015. It did not work because it finds only files whose names are exactly 2015, with no other characters in them.\nYour second command, find . -name *2015* -mtime +1 -exec  ls -ltrh  {} \\;, might have failed for a couple of reasons:\n1. Unquoted * characters are expanded by the shell, then passed on to find.\nIf there are any files directly contained in the current directory (the one you're in when you ran that find ... command) whose names contain 2015 (and don't start with a .), then the shell expanded *2015* into a list of those filenames, then passed that list as arguments to find. This is not what you want--instead, you want to pass *2015* literally as an argument to find, so that find, and not the shell, can find which files match it.\nTo fix that problem, quote *2015*. There are three common ways to do it:\n\n*\n\n*'*2015*' (i.e., find . -name '*2015*' -mtime +1 -exec ls -ltrh  {} \\;)\n\n*\"*2015*\" (i.e., find . -name \"*2015*\" -mtime +1 -exec ls -ltrh  {} \\;)\n\n*\\*2015\\* (i.e., find . -name \\*2015\\* -mtime +1 -exec ls -ltrh  {} \\;)\n\nI suggest writing it with single quotes as '*2015*', because:\n\n*\n\n*Quoting individual characters with \\ can make it hard to see exactly what is being passed by the shell to the find command.\n\n*Quoting with \" sometimes involves somewhat complicated rules.\n\nBut in this case it doesn't really matter. ' and \" both treat * the same and the expression isn't complicated enough for \\ quoting to make it hard to understand.\n2. -mtime +1 only selects files modified two or more days ago.\nAs man find says:\n       Numeric arguments can be specified as\n\n       +n     for greater than n,\n\n       -n     for less than n,\n\n       n      for exactly n.\n\n       -mtime n\n              File's data was last modified n*24 hours ago.  See the  comments\n              for -atime to understand how rounding affects the interpretation\n              of file modification times.\n       -atime n\n              File was last accessed n*24 hours ago.  When  find  figures  out\n              how  many  24-hour  periods  ago the file was last accessed, any\n              fractional part is ignored, so to match -atime +1, a file has to\n              have been accessed at least two days ago.\n\nSuppose a file was modified 47 hours ago. To figure out how many 24-hour periods that is, find rounds down: it is one 24-hour period ago. But -mtime +1 matches only files whose modification times are strictly more than one 24-hour period ago. Thus files from yesterday are not matched.\nSee Why does find -mtime +1 only return files older than 2 days? for more information, as suggested by steeldriver.\nTo find files last modified anytime more than 24 hours ago, I suggest instead stipulating it as 1440 minutes ago with -mmin +1440:\nfind . -name '*2015*' -mmin +1440 -exec ls -ltrh {} \\;\n\nSome readers might be wondering why I did not quote {}. Some people quote {} to remind humans that it is not an expression for brace expansion. Bourne-style shells (like bash) don't require {} with nothing inside to be quoted. Maybe some non-Bourne-style shell does treat it specially; that might be why some users quote it. But there's also a misconception that one must sometimes quote {} so -exec handles filenames with spaces correctly. That;s false: with {} or '{}', find gets the same arguments, as the shell removes the quotes before passing '{}' to find. To counter this misconception, I don't quote {}, but it's a matter of style--if you prefer {} to document how the shell isn't treating { and } specially, that's fine.\nI recommend you also either change your ls command, or (as muru has suggested) replace it with find's -ls action. ls -ltrh is probably not doing what you intend because it is run separately for each file found and thus the -t and -r flags, which specify sorting, are irrelevant.\nThough the output will be formatted a bit differently than with ls -l, using -ls is simpler and easier.\nfind . -name '*2015*' -mmin +1440 -ls\n\nOr if you decide you really only need to list the file's names (including their paths, relative to .), you can simply specify no action, causing the default -print action to be used:\nfind . -name '*2015*' -mmin +1440\n\n\nA: Quote the expression and I suggest you quote the brackets as well\nfind . -name \"2015\" -mtime +1 -exec  ls -ltrh  '{}' \\;\n\nor \nfind . -name \"*2015*\" -mtime +1 -exec  ls -ltrh  '{}' \\;\n\nyou do not need to pass the files you find to ls\nfind . -name \"*2015*\" -mtime +1\n\n\nA: In zsh, you can use glob qualifiers (this is a unique zsh feature, not available in other shells such as bash).\nls -ltr *2015*(m+1)\n\nThis only lists files in the current directory; to traverse directories recursively, use\nls -ltr **/*2015*(m+1)\n\nWith find, -name 2015 only finds files whose name is exactly 2015. -name *2015* only works if there are no files whose name contains 2015 in the current directory, because the shell expands the pattern *2015* before find is invoked. You need to quote the pattern:\nfind -name '*2015*' -mtime +1 …\n\nNote that both find -mtime +1 and zsh's *(m+1) find files that are at least 48 hours old, not files older than today. The plus sign means “strictly more than” and the number of days is rounded down. To find files that are at least 24 hours old, use -mtime +0 or (m+0).\nIf you want to find files that were last modified yesterday or before, you can use find with the -newermt predicate:\nfind -name '*2015*' ! -newermt 'today 0:00' …\n\nThere's no really convenient way to make this test in zsh.\n", "Q: Program[Digikam] chooses wrong qt lib and crashes I run Ubuntu 14.04 64bit.

I used yumi to create the disk and tried creating it with the ubuntu disk write. I have no clue what i'm missing.\n\nA: I recommend creating your boot disk with dd, as in:\ndd if=image.iso of=/dev/sdc\n\nChange image.iso to the filename you want to write and /dev/sdc to the device filename for your USB flash drive. Third-party disk-imaging tools might or might not create a disk image that's bootable in EFI mode. That said, some rare computers make it necessary to use such a third-party tool to prepare a bootable USB drive; but in these cases, you must ensure that the tool is capable of creating an EFI-bootable image. The last I checked, YUMI did not work for this. I don't know for sure about the Ubuntu Startup Disk Creator. Tools that can create EFI-bootable disks often require explicitly setting an EFI compatibility option.\nOnce the image is created, you may need to use your firmware's built-in boot manager to boot it. This is usually accessed via a function key, but which one varies from one machine to another (and some use another key entirely, like Esc or Enter). If the drive is bootable in both BIOS/CSM/legacy and EFI/UEFI modes, there will normally be two entries for the disk in the boot manager. To boot in EFI/UEFI mode, select the entry that includes \"UEFI\" in the description. The one without \"UEFI\" in the description boots to BIOS/CSM/legacy mode.\nYou can check your boot mode by looking for a directory called /sys/firmware/efi; if that directory is present, you've booted in EFI/UEFI mode. If it's absent, you've probably booted in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode.\n\nA: It took me a long time to figure this out, but I found something that works.  I have installed Ubuntu twice on my Toshiba Sattelite e45t-A4200 that was running windows 8.\nHere's how:\n\n\n*\n\n*Enter BIOS and change boot from UEFI to CSM (mine was under advanced),  change the boot priority to USB first and disable the Secure Boot.\n\n*Boot machine using the USB disk.\n\n*Install Ubuntu (in CSM mode) using the USB disk.  Don't bother \"Download updates as you install\" this time.\n\n*When you reboot your machine enter BIOS.If you computer has a HDD and SSD make the HDD the first.  Also, change your boot mode back to UEFI.\n\n*Reboot the machine using the USB drive.  \n\n*Reinstall Ubuntu (in UEFI) using the USB disk.  \n\n*Reboot the machine one last time from the USB drive.  \n\n*Run boot-repair from the USB drive.\nDisclaimer  I used this method to REPLACE windows.  I do not know that it would work with a side by side install.  For that, I know it works. \nI hope this helps!  \n-Josh\n\nA: I recently had to do a fresh install and had to re-figure this out.  My previous solution did not work.  Here are some things that I figured out about UEFI installation that made it work (properly).  \nI used a usb stick to boot with.  To boot in UEFI the boot stick must be formatted in FAT32 to boot.  \nFor whatever reason, in my BIOS I had to \"restore to defaults\" for the boot stick to work.  \nAfter the installation was done I had to boot form the USB stick again and run \"boot-repair\" to make the installation work.  No problems since.  I hope this helps and I think it is a much better/easier way of installing using UEFI.  \n", "Q: What is meant by \"put the file in your path\" I am little confused about an instruction I came across. It stated \"put the file in your path\". I interpreted that as to add\nPATH=$PATH:'~/.conkystart'\n\nto my ~/.bashrc. The file is ~/.conkystart \n#!/bin/bash\nconky -c ~/.conkyrc2\n\nand ~/.conkyrc2 is a second conky fig file.\nHowever, when I restarted, the second conkyrc file didn't execute and there were no errors in the bash terminal. Am I interpreting \"put the file in your path\" incorrectly? If so, what should I have done instead?\nThe end game is for ~/.conkyrc2 to execute on boot.\n\nA: To add a file to your PATH, first find out what PATH is with:\necho $PATH\n\nThen, move the file to one of those directories.\n", "Q: Bluetooth can't be enabled in Ubuntu 14.10 I have this problem since I do a fresh install Ubuntu 14.10 (previously I don't have this problem in 14.04).

When I opened my files in Ubuntu, I didn't find my hard drives under Device. The only one option available was Computer.\nIs there anyway that I could get my data and hard drives back?\n\nA: While I'm not quite sure sure what you exactly mean by \"opening your files\" and where you were expecting your hard drives to appear, I'll take a stab at it.  \nMy guess is that you haven't lost your data.  My guess is that you just don't have the disk mounted.\nIf indeed you have multiple hard drives, other than the one you're running ubuntu on, Ubuntu doesn't automatically mount them; you need to manually do that.\nHere's how\nTo keep it simple, let's do this via the terminal so go ahead and open that.\nthen enter the following to list all available disks and their respective partitons on the system.\nlsblk\n\nMy output looks like this: \nNAME   MAJ:MIN RM   SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT\nsda      8:0    0  29.8G  0 disk \n├─sda1   8:1    0   833M  0 part /boot\n└─sda2   8:2    0  25.2G  0 part /\nsdb      8:16   0 465.8G  0 disk \n├─sdb1   8:17   0   667M  0 part \n├─sdb2   8:18   0     1K  0 part \n├─sdb5   8:21   0  11.2G  0 part [SWAP]\n├─sdb6   8:22   0  18.6G  0 part \n├─sdb7   8:23   0 344.6G  0 part /home\n└─sdb8   8:24   0  90.7G  0 part \nsdc      8:32   0 931.5G  0 disk \n└─sdc1   8:33   0 931.5G  0 part \n\nAs noted in the comments, you won't see C: or D: or whatever.  Instead you'll see something like sda (for example) and then its respective partitions sda1 and sda2.  Sda is an actual disk which is divided into partitions 1 and 2.\nThe best way to tell what it is is by the size of each disk and its description, product and vendor.  I know, for example that my solid state drive is /dev/sda above because it's 30Gigs.  I then can guess what each partition does based on its size, mountpoint etc.  Worst case scenario I can try mounting each one and seeing what I find.\nNow you are ready to mount the partition.  So if we wanted to mount /dev/sda1 we would run\nsudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt\n\nThen to check out the files, you just navigate to the directory /mnt and browse it like a regular directory (as that's pretty much what it is).\nTo unmount the partition (like if you wanted to use mnt to check another partition) run the following:\nsudo umount /mnt\n\nIf you want to mount it each time you run the machine, there are a variety of gui mount managers out there that can help you.\n", "Q: Gnome-Shell 3.10.4 on screen keyboard can't type when prompt appears When using the out of box on-screen keyboard in Gnome-Shell 3.10.4, and a prompt appears, such as entering the root password for gksudo; the on-screen keyboard is behind the prompt and I cannot type on the on-screen keyboard.\nHow can I go about fixing this? Should I use onboard instead?\n\nA: I used gksu-properties to change the \"Grab mode\" to disable.\nsimply type:\ngksu-properties\n\nin a terminal or run dialogue box.\nThis changes weather the screen is \"grabbed\" or not while entering the password. Disabling this allows other applications to eavesdrop, a security vulnerability. But insistently it allows other applications to input to the password field, useful for on-screen keyboard and scripts. You can switch between the modes by setting \"Grab mode\" to prompt, as the setting suggests you will be greeted by a prompt before your able to enter your password.\nI'd like to point out that most of us enter passwords in the terminal without grabbing anything, this presumably has the same security vulnerability as using gksudo without grab. The \"secure keyboard\" option found in xterm by holding down ctrl and Left Clicking then selecting \"secure keyboard\" has what seems to be the same function as grab.\n", "Q: Ubuntu doesn't boot after bleachbit I used bleachbit on my Ubuntu 14.10 system.

That means that the partition is mounted, so theoretically, you ought to be able to access it, and I think you ARE accessing it without realizing it.\nBy giving it the mount point of /home, one of the \"homes\" of your directory system is that entire partition.

Install Ubuntu creating a separate boot EFI partition for GRUB. Everything is in place and works fine.\nThen I connect my internal HDD again. Everything is fine, system boots to Ubuntu since it is in the first boot device on bios. I can also boot Windows by pressing [ESC] and choosing [Windows Boot Manager]. Shut it down, power on again everything is like I wanted it to be: by default it boots into Ubuntu; by interrupting I can switch to Windows.\nThe whole thing brakes down when I disconnect external SSD. Windows still boots but after plugging back in the external SSD, Ubuntu is unable to boot!\nIn initial installation, Ubuntu appears as \nubuntu (*external_device_name*)\n\non boot list.\nAfter disconnecting, starting windows, shutting down and connecting again, this changes to\nUEFI: ubuntu (*external_device_name*)\n\nand it boots straight into windows when I choose this option.\nI can fix this using boot-repair but it keeps happening again!\nWhat might I be doing wrong?\nUPDATE 1\nI guess I found what causes my problem. I installed a software called EasyBCD. Here it shows entries in my boot menu after I made clean working install:\nThere are a total of 2 entries listed in the bootloader.\n\nDefault: Windows 8.1\nTimeout: 30 seconds\nEasyBCD Boot Device: C:\\\n\nEntry #1\nName: ubuntu\nBCD ID: {6a50bd8a-ddbd-11e4-8278-806e6f6e6963}\nDevice: \\Device\\HarddiskVolume5\nBootloader Path: \\EFI\\ubuntu\\shimx64.efi\n\nEntry #2\nName: Windows 8.1\nBCD ID: {current}\nDrive: C:\\\nBootloader Path: \\Windows\\system32\\winload.efi\n\nI have 4 partitions on my internal HDD, 3 partitions on my external SSD. EFI partition of external SSD (sdb1) corresponds to \\Device\\HarddiskVolume5.

I'm not happy but not for the reason you describe.\nWhat is happening to you, I think, is that when you installed ubuntu on your external media, you did so by first entering setup, and in doing so you configured your computer only temporarily for this bootable medium.  Once it was unplugged your computer \"forgot\" it, as my asus netbook always does.\nIf I'm right you might be able to boot by pressing a key combination at boot time.  On the asus it is ESC, but on HPs it is usually F12.  Please let me know if that helps.\n", "Q: Unable to set permissions for new files added to the directory I'm trying to add permissions for my nginx html folder using the following:\nsudo chown -R my-user:www-data /webdirectory\nsudo chmod -R 0755 /webdirectory\n\nIt works for existing files in the directory, however any added files I need to execute those lines again.\nAny solutions?\n\nA: You are looking for umask. umask is a shell builin that will decide what will the default permission of a newly created file. The value of umask can vary from user to user.\nTo check the umask value of the current user, run umask in the terminal:\n$ umask \n0002\n\nThe first 0 indicates the absence of SUID/SGID/Sticky bit, it is the default first bit value so if we don't need to set any of those three bits we usually don't use this bit. \nThe umask value is actually deducted from 777 (in case of a directory) and from 666 (In case of a file) to get the permission of a newly created file/directory. So, if the umask is 0002 the newly created file by this user will have a permission of (666 - 002)=664 and a directory will have (777 - 002)=775.\nTo change the umask value for only current user permanently, put the umask value at the end of the ~/.bashrc of the user. For example:\necho \"umask 022\" >> ~/.bashrc\n\nFor changing temporarily, run:\n$ umask 022\n\nThe global umask value can be found and changed from /etc/login.defs:\n$ grep \"^UMASK\" /etc/login.defs \nUMASK       022\n\n****Note than you should not use chmod/chown randomly unless you are absolutely sure about the outcome.\n\nA: umask is correct but only covers the chmod part of your question, there is a more elegant way to do this.\nTo make sure, that you don't have to chown or chmod again, put your user to the www-data group of the apache webserver, like so:\nuseradd -G my-user www-data\n\nWith this add you are able to wirte in this folder and the username and group will be exactly what you asked for. Also with this, you don't even need to chmod again, because the webserver can read it, and so the content can be delivered without any restrictions.\n", "Q: Cant access Google and facebook I am using Ubuntu from last 5 years. From last 3 days i am experiencing a problem related to internet, I am unable to open either google.com or facebook.com for first half an hour, allother websites are working, after half an hour or so they are opening. I tried even with ping command, but same result.\n\nA: I suspect you are experiencing an issue with your web browser.  I'll explain.\nBeginning about 9 months ago, I began having problems with various web browsers, not all google browsers.  The Google Chromium browser to be found in the software center worked on older computers but not newer ones, different version apparently.  Firefox worked right for about two weeks and then began having the same issues as Google.  Everyone I talked to, everyone using Ubuntu, said the same thing.  \nTo this very day I am forced to use THREE BROWSERS to do all I need to do without being burdened by and unexplained browser crash, video that won't load, or tool that won't work.  My browsers of choice currently are the Ubuntu included Firefox, Opera, and Google Chrome browser.  That's Chrome, not Chromium.  Google for \"install google chrome\" and your first result will assist you installing it under Ubuntu).\nInstalling Opera is far more complicated than Chrome, but it can be done.  I've done it on not less than five installations but it always takes me nearly half an hour.  Opera also seems to be the most functional, which is why I am bothering to mention it.  There is no harm in having more than one browser, in fact I recommend always having two handy.\n", "Q: someone is using may sendmail to spam other I have an Ubuntu  (14.04.1 LTS) install on AWS with sendmail.\nI keep getting messages from mail servers that are unable to deliver some of my messages (I did not send) and all are about sex.\nSo I figure someone is using my server to spam people.\nHow do I start handling this?\nCan anyone direct me to article or tutorial explaining this?\n\nA: If sendmail is sending out those messages, you should check the logs. Bit cheap of me, but please start at the link be below. Combine the email addresses, time stamps mentioned in the NDR's (Non-Delivery Report) and check the logs. \nwhere-to-check-log-of-sendmail\nBut, you might not be even sending those emails from your server.\nIt could be bounce back/backscatter, some other server sending spam --but using your domainname as the sender. When the receiving server can't (or won't) deliver them it returns a NDR to your server with the help of the DNS MX records.\nYou might be able to see if this is the case if you look at the headers & messages of the NDR reports you receive. \nWhat might help (...but not 100% of the time...) in these cases is making it harder for spammers to abuse your domainname. With the help of SPF & DKIM records.\nSee: bounce-back-backscatter-spam-who-stole-my-email-address\n", "Q: Wrong display name and icon in launcher I am trying to correct the icon and the display name of Arduino IDE in my launcher. I used to lock on the sketch of Arduino IDE 1.6.3 in 7 April into the launcher. It didn't work as I expected so I removed it and I reinstalled the old version of Arduino IDE with this command:\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install arduino arduino-core  \n\nThe problem here is whenever I opened the Arduino IDE, it still showed me the name of sketch and Arduino 1.6.3 instead of just Arduino IDE.\nHow to remove the old one and correct the display icon here!\n\n\n\nA: Either in /usr/share/applications or ~/.local/share/applications, a \"left over\" .desktop file must be left behind. \nRemove the duplicate desktop file(s), log out and back in and it should be fixed. If you are having doubts on which is the right one to remove: .desktop files show their icon once you make them executable. You can also look inside the file (drag it over an opened gedit window). \nFile- names of the .desktop files can be confusing, since the name you see in Dash can (and will) be different from the name in Dash; in Dash, you see the name, defined in the Name= line of the file.\nRelated: https://askubuntu.com/a/516346/72216\n", "Q: Docky runs as regular plank.

Then it turned out that I've added another repository for Docky, which made it like Plank.\nOpen Software center, go to \"Edit\" -> \"Software Sources\", and click on \"Other Software\". Look for a repository that has plank or docky in its name, and if you fine one, uncheck it, and close the window.

I'm a newbie to Linux (I installed it about a month ago) and there are some other distributions that I would like to run on my old computer (specifically Linux Mint). I've tried everything and I can't seem to install it to where I can select the OS on boot-up. When I burn the .iso Disk Image to a DVD R/W (which I've done multiple times) and use it, it unarchives the file instead of running it as an installer.\n\nA: There is a detailed guide on how to burn ISO images on windows or Ubuntu here.\nAfter you have successfully burned the image, put the disk in the DVD drive and reboot your PC. Now you have to choose the boot device to boot from. There is a default boot order set in the BIOS. This is the order that BIOS searches different drives and devices, and then boots the first bootable OS that it finds.\nIn most cases the first bootable device is your HDD drive so your Ubuntu installation will be booted. To boot from your newly burned DVD disc, you have to select the DVD device. On different BIOS-es the key that opens the boot menu varies, but in many cases it is F12, another F-key, esc or del.\nSo after you reboot start repeatedly pressing F12 (or other key) before your system is booted. If you succeed you will see a prompt with a list of devices.\n\nYou should select your CD-ROM/DVD drive and then you will be presented with options of the new distro (depending on how you created your DVD disk available options could be Try Ubuntu without installing or Install Ubuntu). You can select one of them and proceed with the installation.\nNote that installing many distros on the same machine for testing purposes is not a very good idea. If you want to completely replace one distro with another it is ok, but if you want to have two or more distros at a same time I suggest you download VirtualBox from Ubuntu Software Center and install other operating systems in virtual machines. You can install as many distros you like on this machine and test them without the risk of messing up your system or having to delete and repartition each time you decide you do not like this distro.\nEdit\nTo permanently change the boot order you will have to enter the BIOS setup page. To do so reboot your PC and press F2 or on some BIOS-es DEL several times before the OS boots.\nThis will bring you a blue screen with BIOS configuration. From the top menu go to Boot section and there you can see the available Devices and their order. You can change this order with enter and Up/Down Arrows. You can bring your CD drive at first place, so it will aways boot from CD if it is present.\n\n", "Q: PHP Fatal error: Uncaught exception 'PDOException' with message 'SQLSTATE[HY000] [2002] Connection refused I have a different server for my database.\nWhen I connected to database with PDO, I used the IP address of database VM for host parameter:\n$dbh = new pdo(\"mysql:host=192.168.56.103;port=3306;dbname=data\",'root','root')\n\nBut I get connection refused (PDOException' with message 'SQLSTATE[HY000] [2002]').

I'm in love with Ubuntu, but as it is my first time to install it I have some questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*My hard drive is 1TB I need to understand the concept of the partition layout. For example, I need to have 3 partitions for my data the same way that I had it in Windows (C for system files & D data files, E data files)  D and E have to be secured, so whenever I install a new operating system it doesn't affect the files in it.\n\n*As I am developer and designer I need to have Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator installed on my PC. \nThank you to this wonderful community, I'm proud to be one of you. \n\nA: There are two cases of partitioning - if you will be installing Ubuntu for first time, or if you have already installed Ubuntu.\nFresh install of Ubuntu\nAt some point during the installation process you will come to this window, where you will be prompted to choose installation type:\n\nNormally if you are a new user you should select Erase everything and install Ubuntu. This will create the needed partitions automatically.\nBut since you want more advanced partitioning you want to choose the last option - Something else.\nAfter you choose it and click next you will see the partitioning window. If you previously had some OS on the hard disk you will see several partitions present. You click on each of them and click - sign to delete them, until you have only free space left like in the image note that deleting partitions will erase all information on your HDD!\n\nNow you are ready to create partitions.\nFirst depending on your BIOS settings and the boot mode you selected (Legacy boot or UEFI) if you chose UEFI you will have to create an EFI system partition.\nClick on the free space row and then click on the + button on the bottom left side and choose following parameters:\nSize: 100 [MB]\nType of the new partition: Primary\nLocation of the new partition: Beginning of the space\nUse as: EFI boot partition\n\nThen click ok. The new partition should show up.\nAfter that you will need to create a SWAP partition. Usually I create mine with the same size of how much RAM my PC has. It is often recommended to have at least half of the size of your RAM so if your PC has 8 GB RAM, your minimum swap size would be 4 GB, but you can make it larger.\nSo again click on the free space then click + and select:\nSize: 6000 [MB]\nType of the new partition: Primary\nLocation of the new partition: Begining of the space\nUse as: SWAP\n\nNow you need to create the partition for the root filesystem. Click on the free space then click + and select:\n\nFor size you can choose between 20 000 MB (20 GB) and 80 000 MB (80 GB) since you have 1000 GB HDD. This way you will have all other space left for your home folder and files.\nYes this is the last partition you have to make - the one that will mount the /home directory where all users and user data will be stored. Later on if you need to reinstall your OS you will only format the root partition and you can be sure your home partition will stay same as it is without touching it. Also all of your program's settings and data will be there, because most programs store their cache in users' home folders.\nSo one last time click free space click + and select\nSize: [Use the default proposed it will all space left]\nType of the new partition: Primary\nLocation of the new partition: Begining of the space\nUse as: Ext4\nMount point: /home\n\nThat's it! Click next and then the install process will continue.\nNote that in Linux you do not have to create multiple partitions (like in windows D: for work E: for games), though you can. In windows is a good idea to split large partitions in smaller ones, but with Linux this is not the case. You can create separate folders in your home directory to organize things up. All of them will be safe from reinstall under the /home partition.\nAlready installed Ubuntu\nIf you have already installed Ubuntu and you used default installer suggestion, you probably have your /home and root / folders under one partition. In order to move the home folder to new partition, you will have to shrink some free space from the / partition and then move home.\nThis is a very risky operation and may cause loss of files if something goes wrong. You should first make a backup if you have important data.\nThe process of moving the home folder to a new partition is well described here . After you follow up this tutorial you should have a separate partition for your home folder.\n\nA: Yes, as in windows you can make one partition for Linux and one for data files or all together in linux partition where you can store in your home folder which is more convenient.\nBut unfortunately you cannot get Adobe Photoshop or Adobe Illustrator for Linux but you can run it in wine, an application which lets you to run windows applications.\nYou can install wine with these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Press Ctrl + Alt + T\n\n*Enter this command and press Enter\nsudo apt-get install wine1.6-i386\n\n\n*If asked for password type it.\n\n*accept all conditions.\n\n*You're done.\n\n\nNow take the installation file of the windows application you want to install, right click it and open with Wine. Then as usual accept license agreements and install it. To run search wine select it and open the app you installed.\n\nA: Though I will not fault any of the very good advice offered by others, I would like to make a suggestion that I'm confident will reduce your anxieties regarding the outcomes of certain actions.  My guess is that like most people you have an older computer laying about gathering dust.  My advice would be that you do your first installation on that.  Not only will it make the installation process more familiar when you work with your main machine but in fact you might find that your older machine performs so well with Ubuntu (it is twice as fast as windows) that you may choose to keep the two machines separate; one for Windows and one for Ubuntu.\nAs for your desired installation, if you have a working windows installation, I would advise you to choose the \"side by side\" installation option giving you a dual bootable computer, this way you are sure to have your familiar interface should you become frustrated and wish to return to something more familiar.\nLastly, I feel obligated to nag you to PLEASE back up all your data to external media, even data in your partitions D and E.  I'm saying this because all too often newbies make a terrible mistake and overwrite their previous data.  I'm not saying the installation will be tricky, necessarily, but please don't make the mistakes made by so many others.  We aren't kidding!\nPS:  Re-reading your post I think you seem to be saying you installed Ubuntu on your computer already, but if that is the case, what do you mean partitions D and E need to be secured.  How do you mean \"secured\"?\n", "Q: Asus Z87 PRO - fan speed detector - failed to 'make' nct6775 drivers I want to monitor the fans in my HTPC due to a recent and inexplicable temperature increase of 5+ degrees C.\nPackage 'lm-sensors' does not detect fan sensors.

I'm trying to install ecryptfs at an Ubuntu Server that will crypt a folder with thelp of Trusted Processing Module (TPM).\nI'm following the following instruction from IBM (it is not for Ubuntu but at least something) http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/linuxonibm/liaai/ecrypts/liaaiecryptfsbegin.htm\nAnd I stopped at the phase when I need to generate TPM key with help of eCryptFS-Utils programme. I should use  \"ecryptfs-generate-tpm-key -p 0 -p 2 -p 3\" command to do this. But there is not such kind of a tool in Ubuntu ecryptfs-utils!\nIt is in Debian package but not in Ubuntu. I was trying to install Debian package manually but with no success. There are too many dependeces to other libs which are not in Ununtu or they are too old for debian package.\nSo, what should I do? \n\nA: From what I've been able to tell, this tool is obsolete and apparently isn't built any more with the Ubuntu ecryptfs userspace tools.  As you read in the IBM whitepaper, the ecryptfs-generate-tpm-key command is used in conjunction with the TSPI key module of ecryptfs.\nBut a maintainer of ecryptfs has stated that the TSPI module was a proof of concept (supposedly it doesn't perform well since it uses TPM on every file I/O) and should not have made it into the upstream ecryptfs-utils project to begin with:  https://bugs.launchpad.net/ecryptfs/+bug/787907.  He said he was going to remove it when kernel 3.1 was released; I suppose that has probably happened by now.  (Maybe he missed the man page?)\nApparently the replacement is to use trusted and encrypted keys on the kernel keyring, but I'm struggling with that, too: Practical use of ecryptfs, encrypted keys, and TPM: how to convert existing user key to encrypted key?\n", "Q: No wireless icon with Ubuntu 14.04 LiveCD I am currently a Windows 8.1 user.

Usually all is normal, regardless of the idle time I take. However, this is the second time that I lose my session after an idle time with the X session locked. It happens like this: when I return to my station, I log in, and then, after a few weird flashes, it goes back to the main log in screen again (just like if I had restarted the computer, which is not what is happening by the way because I have a boot password that prevents the immediate run of the OS). When I enter my password again, a new session starts, (no previous application running). However, there is some memory as the browser remember my last tabs open and gmusicbrowser's queue list.\nBoth times that I have lost my session have been long idle times (more than one hour). Apparently, this only affects me if idle time is long. I tried to reproduce the problem by short idle times and I can't. I will try to reproduce it for lon idle times but that is not very handy.\n\nA: This problem was solved when upgrading to 16.04. Screen has no single glitch either. All works fine. The open-source radeon driver works flawlessly! \n", "Q: Ubuntu permission denied when running as a daemon I have an Ubuntu staging server on AWS which runs a tiny Sinatra app using Thin webserver.\nThe sinatra app runs some git clone commands when invoked and everything works great when I run rackup from my user.\nNaturally I want to run the server as a daemon, for this I used rackup -D and invoked the app. This time, I got an exception from git which tells the daemon is not authorized to write to the target folder:\ncould not create work tree dir 'path/to/clone': Permission denied\n\nAs I understand it, daemons have the same privileges as the user who run them so how come the task fails?\nI also tried chmod -R 777 the directory but it didn't work..\n\nA: My problem ended up being rack itself.\nTurns out (as explained here) that rack, when run with the rackup -D command (as a daemon) changes the working dir to /.\n\nA: Check if the executable has the setuid bit set. That would make it run as the owner of the file, not the user that launched it. You can check by running ls -l appname and looking at the fourth character in the permissions mask (in place of the owner executable bit). If it is an s then the setuid bit is set.\nDaemons are usually set to run with setuid, so they are expected to not have the permissions of the user that started them. This is in contrast to non-daemon apps, which are expected to have the user's permissions. You will need to add the daemon's use r to the group of the files that you would like affected, and ensure that the group permissions allow the actions.\n", "Q: ntop-ng installation, missing package I'm trying to install ntop-ng on Ubuntu 14.04 via the official guide.\nHowever, I have the following error\nThe following packages have unmet dependencies:\n nbox : Depends: tshark but it is not going to be installed\n\nIf I try to install tshark, it returns\nThe following packages have unmet dependencies:\n tshark : Depends: wireshark-common (= 1.10.6-1) but 1.11.3+svn54293-0ubuntu1~raring1~ppa0 is to be installed.\n\nWhat can I do to install this software?\nEDIT: It seems that the problem is with wireshark-common.\nIndeed\n$>dpkg -l | grep wireshark-common\nii  wireshark-common                                                     1.11.3+svn54293-0ubuntu1~raring1~ppa0               amd64        network traffic analyser (common files)\n\nThis name is a bit suspicious to me: why raring?

Open SSH is part of the default Ubuntu server installation. SFTP is an extension of the Secure Shell protocol (SSH) version 2.0 to provide secure file transfer capabilities.\nYou can remove the openSSH server from your Ubuntu server, but then you will lose the ability to log into your server remotely using SSH protocol. If you are sure that you will never remotely connect to the server, and want to do this use the command:\nsudo apt-get remove openssh-server\n\nAlternately you may disable SSHD to auto-start when your server starts up. See How do I disable SSHD from starting automatically?. Thanks to David Foerster for the link.\nYou may also want to learn about How to harden an SSH server? so that it is not easy for a hacker to gain access to your server remotely.\nHope this helps\n", "Q: What advantage does a GPU card offer in an Ubuntu laptop? The time has come for me to buy a new laptop. I use Ubuntu (well, Kubuntu) and nothing else. Out of my working hours I use my laptop to watch movies and sometimes I have to do video conversions with ffmpeg (yeap, a standalone compilation because I do NOT want avconv, but please don't start flame war, that is a completely different topic altogether).\nI can buy a laptop with an integrated Intel video card as I have had until now, or I can choose a laptop with a GPU card (Nvidia, I think) which reduces battery life but allegedly has some advantages. What would be those advantages?\nWindows users with GPU cards can see movies with on-the-fly frame interpolation. That is not possible in linux yet, as far as I know. And, if that is not possible, why would I want to have a laptop with a GPU card being an Ubuntu user? If the GPU card is only going to be a piece of plastic sucking extra milliwatts, I prefer to spare my money.\n\nA: First things that comes to my mind:\n\n\n*\n\n*For playing games - you know Steam came to Linux also we have Wine.\n\n*For heavy programs that require 3D acceleration like Blender.\n\n*For watching 4k HD Movies.\n\n*Newer desktop environments like KDE and Unity offer advanced look and feel of the OS when you tweak the settings but for that you need good GPU. \nGenerally if you use your laptop only for work or browsing internet and watching normal Movies - you don't need one.\n", "Q: 32 bit on 64 bit causing strange characters I installed a 32 bit game server on 64 bit ubuntu server 14.04.2 LTS.

How do I fix it?\nFor clarification:\nThe game server is Neverwinter Nights (the original).  I only mention it as it may help diagnose the library at fault.\nI checked my /etc/ld.so.conf.d directory, There don't appear to be any files with strange characters.  You can find the output here.\n\nA: It seems you have some garbage file names in your library path somewhere, made up of these strings. You will need to find them on your disk and remove them, to get rid of this problem. You should look in the paths listed within the files in the /etc/ld.so.conf.d/ directory.\n\nA: I have had this issue for a long time. For me, it was finally the /etc/ld.so.conf file with the /usr/local/lib/libopencv_* path. I commented out the path and I no longer see the garbage printing it out.\n", "Q: Create zip files in /var/www/html using crontabs As the title explains, I'd need to take a file and put it into a zip archive once a day; also, the zip file has to be moved in /var/www/html, where a .php scripts allow users to download it.\nAssuming this:\n\n\n*\n\n*the absolute path of the file is /home/myuser/working-directory/file.txt\n\n*I put all scripts file I need to run using cronjobs in /usr/scripts\n\n*I programmed the following cronjob using sudo crontab -e, instead\nof crontab -e because /var/www/html needs administrative\nprivileges\n\n\nThe results of my thoughts are the followings:\ncreate-zip.sh\n#!/bin/bash\n\ncp /home/myuser/myworkingdir/file.txt /home/myuser/file.txt && cd /home/myuser && zip my-zip-file-$(date \"+%b_%d_%Y_%H.%M.%S\").zip file.txt && rm file.txt && rm /var/www/html/my-zip-file*.zip && mv my-zip-file*.zip /var/www/html && cd\n\nsudo crontab -e\n@daily sh /usr/scripts/create-zip.sh\n\nWell.. it doesn't work. I think that the problem is something related with privileges because I get file.txt copied in /home/myuser , and also the zip is created. But then i can't get the zip moved to /var/www/html, even if the crontab is running under Root privileges.\nAny idea? \nAlso..since a .zip is created once a day, I'd need to remove the previous .zip from /var/www/html before move the new one in there. I tried using \nrm /var/www/html my-zip-file-*.zip\n\n(check the create-zip.sh above) but it doesn't work too.. so I guess it's something wrong with privileges. /var/www/html is into the group www-data and its owner too is www-data.\n\nA: Joining commands with && means that the command on the right will only run if the one on the left was successful. This means that your crontab will fail the first time it is run since there is no zip file in /var/www/html/ so the rm /var/www/html/my-zip-file*.zip fails and the mv will not be executed. \nSo, you can either create a file of the right name that can be deleted and keep the same cron command:\ntouch /var/www/html/my-zip-file.zip\n\nOr, you can use ; instead of &&:\ncp /home/myuser/myworkingdir/file.txt /home/myuser/file.txt && \ncd /home/myuser && \nzip my-zip-file-$(date \"+%b_%d_%Y_%H.%M.%S\").zip file.txt && \nrm file.txt && \nrm /var/www/html/my-zip-file*.zip ; \nmv my-zip-file*.zip /var/www/html && cd\n\nYou are also making this way more complex than it needs to be. The copying of /home/myuser/myworkingdir/file.txt to /home/myuser/file.txt is unnecessary since you're only using that to zip it and then are deleting it. The cd commands are not needed, you can use the full path. There's also no reason to cd at the end. All you need is one command to remove any zip files from the target directory and one command to zip them:\nrm /var/www/html/my-zip-file*.zip &&\n zip /var/www/htmlmy-zip-file-$(date \"+%b_%d_%Y_%H.%M.%S\").zip /home/myuser/myworkingdir/file.txt\n\n", "Q: Configure Evince to open maximized with 100% zoom level? I have Ubuntu 12.04.5 LTS installed on my computer.\nIf I open PDF in Evince for the first time, the window is always un-maximized and zoom level is 70%. I want Evince to be maximized and the zoom level set to 100% every time I open a PDF.\nI have tried to adjust the settings and clicked \"Save Current Settings as Default\" but when I open a new PDF, Evince is un-maximized and zoom level is 70%.\nHow can I get Evince to open maximized and with zoom level 100%?\n\nA: Check\ngsettings get org.gnome.Evince zoom\n\nif it is not set to 1.0. See\ngsettings list-recursively org.gnome.Evince\n\nfor all settings.\n\nA: In my case I wanted it to always open documents at 150% by default, so here's what I found out that worked for me (I'm using Evince v3.22.1):\ngsettings set org.gnome.Evince.Default zoom 1.5\ngsettings set org.gnome.Evince.Default sizing-mode free\n\n(I got the hint for the default zoom setting from here: https://askubuntu.com/a/214163/163034)\n\nA: To start Evince maximized:\n\n*\n\n*Install devilspie package:\nsudo apt install devilspie\n\n\n*Create ~/.devilspie folder and evince.ds file in that folder:\nmkdir -p ~/.devilspie && touch ~/.devilspie/evince.ds\n\n\n*Paste this code in ~/.devilspie/evince.ds file:\n(if\n    (is (application_name) \"Document Viewer\")\n    (begin\n       (maximize)\n    )\n)\n\n\n\n*Add devilspie to Startup Applications\n\n\n*Reboot.\ndevilspie' docs:\n\n*\n\n*https://web.archive.org/web/20160415011438/http://foosel.org/linux/devilspie\n\n*https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/DevilsPie\n\n*https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Devilspie\n\nAlternative: Devilspie2\n\nA: To start Evince fullscreen as default, paste following command line :\ngsettings set org.gnome.Evince.Default fullscreen true\n\n\nA: Possible workaround [Debian 9 with Xfce Desktop Environment (ver. 4.12)]:\nIn the /usr/share/applications/evince.desktop file, comment out the existing Exec=... line and replace with:\nExec=sh -c '(sleep 0.6 && wmctrl -r :ACTIVE: -b add,maximized_vert,maximized_horz)& evince \"$@\"' sh %U\n\nFYI, while this will still open groups of files together (e.g. via clicking on a block of files in Thunar), only one of the thusly opened files will be so maximized...\n", "Q: Customize login screen How can I customize my Ubuntu login screen like the one below? As I've already googled most solutions only change the background picture of the login screen not its structure and behaviour.\n\nMy current Ubuntu is 14.10 (Utopic Unicorn)\nI took this picture from here.\n\nA: I think you are looking for the light-dm-webkit greeter. You can find packages here. The current version as of this writing is 0.1.2-0ubuntu2 and it appears it's available in the universe repository as well so you can install it through the software center:\n\nYou'll need it to develop a face browser theme to arrive at your desired solution but this should help you get started. \n", "Q: Release date for MAAS 1.8 Is there any official release date, or estimation, for MAAS 1.8?\nIn the milestone page there is no info in expected column.\n\nA: we haven't yet finalized the 1.8 release plan but plan to have a beta out this month. Are there any specific features in 1.8 that you care about that are not in 1.7? We could look into backporting if necessary.\n", "Q: Cannot add PPA: 'ppa:gluster/ubuntu-glusterfs-3.5' I am runnning into problem adding a repository.\n~# add-apt-repository ppa:gluster/ubuntu-glusterfs-3.5\nCannot add PPA: 'ppa:gluster/ubuntu-glusterfs-3.5'.\nPlease check that the PPA name or format is correct.\n\nAny suggestions.\nThanks\n\nA: This PPA doesn't exist.

To do this as said in one of the answers here, I went into this section (Right-click > Properties > Open With):\n\nAnd selected GIMP Image Editor from the list of Recommended Applications, then I clicked the button Set as default, and this is what I then saw:\n\nAnd then sure enough when I right-clicked on a file of the file type that I had changed the default program for, the normal Image Viewer:\n\nHad been replaced with:\n\nBut yet when double-clicking on a program, it still opens in Image Viewer and not GIMP, even though in all the settings it still says that that the default is now GIMP. \nSo really that is my question, why is this happening and how can I fix it?\n\nOS Information:\nDescription:    Ubuntu 14.10\nRelease:    14.10\n\n\nA: For some of the system default apps you can go to System Settings/Details e.g.:\n\nOr for more advanced you can open Ubuntu-Tweak and go to Admins section and click on File Type Manager:\n\nTo install Ubuntu-Tweak:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:tualatrix/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-tweak\n\nP.S.\nI see you edited a bit your question you want Gimp to open all your photos or pics right? Using my workaround please do mention also that if you change from Image Viewer to Gimp it doesn't mean that you will open all photos with Gimp because this setting serves for .jpg/.jpeg and Gimp for example saves its work in .png portable network graphics by default and the default for .png will be Image Viewer anyways :) so to change that you need to configure all photos formats using Ubuntu-Tweak so they open with Gimp when you double click on them.\n\nA: You can use the settings editor.\nChoose the Mime type, and search for images:\n\nThen change the relevant types to your likings:\n\nAs you can guess I use Shotwell to crob images. Change those to your favorit app!\n", "Q: Add \"virtual\" screen in my PC like a second screen connected I would like to know if there is any software that allows me to add a second \"virtual\" screen to my computer.\nI would like to add this screen over my actual screen.

The behaviour should be exactly like another screen, just over the original one.\nI know about the \"Allways on top\" functionality, I would like to have this second virtual display configurable about the place and size. Maybe there is a way to customize the screen without virtualizing a new one.\n\n\n*\n\n*Does anyone knows any software to do this ? \n\n*Is there any way to add virtual displays on any OS ? \n\n*Is there any book/doc that I could read to learn about virtualizing hardware ?\n\n\nA: You can use VNC to connect to your PC with another session as mentioned in this link \nvirtual-vnc-screen-workspace \n\nA: It's easy to get this behavior using the \"Always On Top\" option as you mentioned. Just start the new program, resize and move it to where you want it to be overplayed (top right in your example), and then right click on it's title bar and click:\n\n\n*\n\n*Always On Top\n\n*Always on Visible Workspace\n\n\nIf this does not fulfill your requirements, and the problem is that you would like the behavior to be repeated for many programs, without you needing to do the above steps, you can try installing VirtualBox (https://help.ubuntu.com/community/VirtualBox) or VMWare. Then make an Ubuntu VM, and run programs in there. You would only need to perform the above actions once per session, but this solution has other limitations.\n", "Q: How to change the Upload size in Ubuntu server 14.10 running onwcloud I want to change the upload size from 513 to some bigger value\nI have Ubuntu server 14.10 running onwcloud\nPHP Version 5.5.12-2ubuntu4.3\nI have checked my PHP version by:\n1.Create a php file with  and open it with your browser\n2.Change to 16G\n/etc/php5/apache2 'php.ini'\n/etc/php5/cli/php.ini\nPHP.ini above are the only one I have on my machine\n\n\n*Restar apache2\n\n\nStill I get owncloud upload max 513MB \nIs there anything else I have to do to change my upload size?\n\nA: What you did didn't work for you, because you have changed the wrong php.ini.

For that, you can't just burn the file onto a disc.You need a DVD authoring tool, such as the free cross-platform (not to mention open-source) DVD Styler (http://www.dvdstyler.org/).

How can I update them to the new Trusty versions?\n\nA: The packages have a \"raring\" reference for different reasons. Most of them appear to be installed from PPA's such as this. These must be manually handled when Ubuntu is updated.\nLooking at your software sources, you should see the relevant PPA sources. You will have to manually update them to your current version, or you could use a tool like this. The PPA may not have packages available for your current version though, which is something that the tool will check.\nThe wallpapers package is just left over from when Raring was installed. The ubuntu-wallpapers package will automatically install the current one,  ubuntu-wallpapers-trusty. You can remove the Raring version if you don't want it.\n\nA: To upgrade those packages to their latest version present in their repository, run:\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install <package_1> <package_2> <package_3> ...\n\nBut this doesn't mean that you'll get a Trusty version, nor that you'll get the very latest version.\nThe former it's simply because the package might have not been updated since Raring.\nThe latter it's simply because the mantainer of the package (or just the PPA, but this is more rare) might have changed in the meantime, and the latest packages might be found in another PPA.\nFor example: your ezame's version (if you're using this PPA) it's the latest version present in the repository (i.e.: it never got updated after Raring in that repository). If there aren't other PPAs mantaining it, the Raring version is the latest version.\n", "Q: How to use a never library on Ubuntu 12.04 I run Ubuntu 12.04 on my laptop and I have originally installed libxcb version 1.8.1 from package, but I need a newer version, because I need it to use the new mesa.\nI have compiled it from git with\n--prefix /usr\n\nand now I have duplicate files. The old ones are in\n/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu\n\nand the new ones under \n/usr/lib\n\nThe problem is, if I try to compile mesa, the compiler founds only the old version of xcb. If I try to remove it with apt-get it wants to remove the whole X, I think. (A lot of xserver-xorg packages.)\nI have tried to do according these guide.\nHow can I solve this problem?\n\nA: Don't worry about the version you installed yourself, you can just simply remove the folder.\nHow to get to another version, then?\nI'd try apt-pinning for installing the package from another source.\nThere will be a newer package in a PPA or even in another Ubuntu version and with apt-pinning you can make them available.\nIt has it's limitations, though.\nHere you can read more about it.\nBut please be careful. Especially updating libc6 to a newer version will break your whole system. It happenend to me, too. So make sure that you don't update the main lib of the system, or that libc6 is not part of the updated packages. \nI will also post another link, where different \"ways\" of installing are presented. Take a look here.\nBut apart from that little flaw apt-pinning works awesome.\n", "Q: ~ and ${USER} don't work in .desktop files Ubuntu 12.04 32-bit\nI am trying to manually create a .desktop file to launch an application. I wish to execute the command:\njava -jar ~/.osbuddy/osbuddy.jar\n\nWhen I run my .desktop file. However, this does not work. I then tried:\njava -jar /home/${USER}/.osbuddy/osbuddy.jar\n\nwhich did not work either.\nFinally,\njava -jar /home/branon/.osbuddy/osbuddy.jar\n\nworked fine. I manually executed all of the above lines through the terminal and it launched the program fine. Why won't it work in a .desktop file?\nThanks for any light you can shed. This is my first time on AskUbuntu so I apologise if I'm ignoring some customary rules of this form. If I've transgressed, please correct me.\n\nA: The command in a .desktop file is not run by a shell but using some system call. Because of that you can't use shell syntax like ~ or ${USER} there\n\nA: As Florian Diesch says, tilde expansion and parameter expansion is not supported in launchers (i.e., .desktop files). But if you need to use them--or other shell expansions--you can do so by making the launcher execute a shell with command-line arguments telling the shell to run a specific command and exit.\nThus you can make your command:\nsh -c 'java -jar ~/.osbuddy/osbuddy.jar'\n\nI've used sh (which in Ubuntu is dash) rather than bash) for efficiency and minimalism. But if you needed an advanced feature provided by bash, you could use that instead.\nIf the path ~/.osbuddy/osbuddy.jar is valid for multiple users and multiple users will be using the launcher, I recommend the sh -c (or if you prefer, bash -c) way. However, if this is only for you and your main goal is to avoid typing /home/brannon...well, passing the command to sh -c involves some extra typing, too.\n", "Q: fakexrandr, Mirror Fake Displays - X Error of failed request: BadMatch I need to create mirror fake displays in one physical monitor. I installed fakexrandr and now I have two fake displays(683x768) on 1366x768(max/prefered) monitor of my laptop.\nWhen I run xrandr --output eDP1~1 --same-as eDP1 --verbose command I'm gettings this error:\n\n*also xrandr --fb 683x768 is printing the same error.\nPhillip Berndt (owner/creator of fakexrandr) said \"It is up to the graphics driver to actually apply any settings.\" in this issue. But it was not a satisfying answer for me.\nFor track down the issue I recorded the output of xrandr --verbose on a two physical monitor setup. You can follow the commits in this repository to see the behavior of the output of xrandr --verbose.\n\n\n*\n\n*After I did this I realized xrandr --output eDP1~1 --same-as eDP1 command is trying to assign current 683x768 to Screen 0:. But graphic driver or physical monitor on my laptop has no 683x768 output option/support. Maybe this could be the problem.(I'm not sure the accuracy of this paragraph, maybe it could be completely wrong.)\n\n\nAll in all: What is the actual reason of this error in the screenshot and the workaround for this problem?\n\nA: RandR is an extension to the X11 server that is used to communicate the configuration of outputs between the server's clients (= applications) and the graphics driver. Most applications don't actually speak the protocol themselves, but instead use a library called libXrandR. FakeXRandR replaces this library with one that still asks the graphics driver for the configuration, but then fiddles with the result to cheat applications into believing that there was an entirely different configuration present than there actually is. Since this necessarily leads to errors if one tries to alter one of the fake outputs, it tries to mitigate the worst issues by replacing any configuration requests on fake outputs with change requests against the original, physical output. But those are, of course, still bound to fail if you try to apply a resolution that only exists on the fake outputs.\nA good analogy might be the situation when you have a fairly old car that is able to drive 50 kph. You now want to drive on a street that requires you to be able to drive 100 kph. The solution that FakeXRandR pursues is to replace the numbers on the tachometer such that the needle now shows 180 kph when you are actually driving 50. If you are stopped in a traffic control, you can say \"See officer, my speedmeter says I can go 180, so I'm fine\", and he'll probably accept this. But you actually still can not drive any faster, because to do that you had to replace the engine, not some printed numbers on your dashboard.\ntl;dr: FakeXRandR is the wrong tool for your task.\nIf you really need to do this on a RandR level, you'll have to patch your graphics driver, both in the X11 and kernel code. I wrote some hits on where to look in another bug report for FakeXRandr. A simpler solution, if all you want is to have the right half of your screen mirror the left, would be to use an advanced compositing window manager like Compiz. Compositing managers add a redirection layer between application windows and what you actually see. This allows them to, in this case, draw each window twice, first on the left side of the output, then on the right side; which would effectively clone your output. There either already is a plugin available for this (install all compiz packages, especially compizconfig-settings-manager, ccsm, and search it for what you need), or it should at least be possible to write one that does what you want with not-too-much effort.\n", "Q: openstack-install fails to bring up public/external interface using 14.04 I have a MAAS server with multiple nodes ready.

I want to resize the dev/sda3 partition.\n\nA: Screenshot is not loaded...\nYet, I assume you need to have both Windows and Linux OS's.\nYour hard drive can have 4 partitions: 2 will go for Windows and 1-2 for Linux (your choice).\nSo, just make empty space, for example 50GB, before /dev/sda3 by formatting and deleting partitions /dev/sda1-2.\nRun Windows installation and choose that empty space (Windows will automatically create 2 partitions: 100MB and (50GB-100MB)).\nWorth mentioning that Windows will overwrite bootloader and you will not be able to access Linux.

I for example know that my T530 is unable to detect my USB 3.0 HDD enclosures and thumb drives and let me boot from them after powering on the laptop, but with a warm reboot everything works. Another example is an external dock that doesn't play nice, partitioning some drives in it is different than connecting the same drive internally.

I found a command online to clear the trash for you because I wanted to clear a file without doing it throught GUI. The command is sudo rm -rf ~/.local/share/Trash/* . I called it and saw the folder on my right monitor disapear. I looked on the left monitor to see everything gone. I looked up recovery tools for ubuntu and found photorec . I used it and it said it recovered 200 files but none are there. EVERYTHING from my home directory is gone as well as Documents downloads, etc. How can I recover this? I had many important things I didn't back up.\n\nA: *\n\n*Run sudo testdisk in terminal.\n\n*Unless you want a log file of the operations, choose No Log and press Enter.\n\n*Hard drives are shown, it is possible to distinguish them with the size and the model name. Go on the hard drive you want to analyse and press Enter.\n\n*You are asked for what is the partition table, for a normal PC it should be Intel. EFI GPT is for recent Apple Macs, Mac is for old PPC Mac. Choose the right one and press Enter.\n\n*Choose Analyse and press Enter.\n\n*Testdisk shows the current partitions, press Enter again to do a Quick Search\n\n*Choose the partition that contains the files you want to recover and press the letter P. If you can't identify what is the right partition, you can try one. At any time your can come back to this menu by pressing the letter Q\n\n*You are now in the directory tree (files and folders) of the partition! Each line starting with d letter is a folder, each line starting with a hyphen (-) is a file. Red lines are files/folders that have been deleted. You can move in files and folders with arrow keys on the keyboard, you can open a folder by pressing Enter and you can go to the parent folder by going on the double dot (..) and pressing Enter. The location where you are is always shown at the top near the word Directory. You can recover a file or a folder at any time by pressing C.\n\n*The first time you will press C, you will be asked where to copy the files. You have to move up to the destination folder and press C. For that purpose, you need to know the path of that folder. Once done, testdisk confirms you if the operation succeeded of failed, completely or partially. If you copy a large amount of files, be patient and wait for the transfer even if nothing happens on the screen.\n\n*You're done!\n\nSource: http://computriks.com/en/recover-file-testdisk\n", "Q: can I remove nemo I have Cinnamon installed as my window manager on Ubuntu 14.04.

I need help with command for putting the test file into hdfs and performing a simple computation on the text file. the tutorials found in web are confusing as some of the commands differ for different hadoop and ubuntu versions. \n\nA: To put a file into the HDFS, you can use the put command as shown under:\nhadoop fs -put path-in-your-local-filesystem path-in-HDFS\n\nNote that if you want to put your file within a new directory in HDFS, put will not create the directory itself. You need to mkdir first as shown: (-p to create parent directories as needed)\nhadoop fs -mkdir -p /user/input\nhadoop fs -put /home/hduser/Desktop/input-file /user/input\n\n(assuming input-file saved on hduser's Desktop)\nTo perform computations on the file using Hadoop, you need to write map and reduce functions. I would suggest you to start with the Word Count program to start learning MapReduce Programming. You can refer to Hadoop: The Definitive Guide.\nNext, you need to compile your java source file (say WordCount.java) using:\nsudo javac -classpath /usr/local/hadoop/share/hadoop/common/hadoop-common-2.6.0.jar:/usr/local/hadoop/share/hadoop/common/lib/hadoop-annotations-2.6.0.jar:/usr/local/hadoop/share/hadoop/mapreduce/hadoop-mapreduce-client-core-2.6.0.jar WordCount.java\n\nNext, create a jar file with all the classes using \njar -cvf wc WordCount*.class\n\nwhere wc is the name of the newly created jar.\nNext, run the program using\nhadoop jar jar-name main-class-name input-path-in-HDFS output-path-in-HDFS\n\nFor this example, you can use\nhadoop jar wc WordCount /user/input/input-file /user/output\n\nIt will create the output directory automatically in HDFS.\n", "Q: Juju - Add-unit vs deploy What is the difference between deploy and add-unit in juju?\nFor example when I execute juju deploy wordpress and juju add-unit wordpress, both of the commands pick up a machine to PXE boot and install the OS and the charm.

Some things went a bit bonkers.)\nIt didn't quite work, so I must have missed something.\nHere's what I did:\nUsed gparted to reformat /dev/sda5 and /dev/sda7 as ext4 (which should\nhave cleared out what was on them) and labeled them as root2 and home2\nagain.\nStopped user tasks that modify files like bittorrent. (But I didn't boot\nfrom a live CD, etc.. I made the copies on the running system.)\nUsed rsync to copy everything with permissions, etc. preserved from root\n(/dev/sda3) to root2 (/dev/sda5)\nand from home (/dev/sda6) to home2 (/dev/sda7). (sda3 and sda5 are both\nthe same size as are sda6 and sda7.)\nI don't think it makes a difference, but sda3 is labeled \"root\", sda5 is\nlabeled \"root2\", sda6 is labeled \"home\" and sda7 is labeled \"home2\".\nMounted /dev/sda5 on /media/bigbird/root2\nEdited /media/bigbird/root2/etc/fstab and changed the uuids for root and\nhome to the ones for /dev/sda5 and /dev/sda7.\n(Got them by running ls -l /dev/disk/by-uuid and copy and pasting them.)\nRan grub-customizer which updated the boot menu to show the new OS on\n/dev/sda5.\nThought I was done and rebooted, selecting the OS on /dev/sda5 on the\ngrub2 menu.\nBoot looked fine, but when I ran df, it showed root as /dev/sda3 and\nhome as /dev/sda6 - like nothing had changed.\nMounted /dev/sda5  again and verified that my changes to fstab were\nstill there. They were.\nNoticed that /etc/fstab~ was left over from the editing and deleted it.\nTried to get online, but couldn't. My wifi said it was connected, but\nthere was a second instance of the connection available that should not\nhave been there.

(Other entries have the same problem.) It may have other errors. I'm not familiar with it enough to know. (FYI: the kernel versions on sda5 are a little old because I have done updates on sda3 since copying it and haven't run the rsyncs again yet.)\nI just looked at the grub entry again and I can't see how it worked at all! It looks like it's looking for kernel 46 on sda3 - which doesn't exist. That older kernel is only on sda5 because I haven't run the rsyncs again yet.\nThis could be something caused by grub-customizer. I don't know.

Unfortunately something seems to have broken and is now causing a boot loop for Windows 7:\nI can boot Ubuntu perfectly fine and I can chose between Ubuntu and Windows Boot Manager from GRUB. But as soon as I select Windows, it says Windows is loading files... and then I'm back at GRUB.\nI followed the following step-by-step guide during the install. I set up the partitions as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*/ on SSD alongside Windows\n\n*/home and swap on separate HDD\n\n\nI have already tried the following things to solve the problem:\n\n\n*\n\n*run boot-repair with recommended settings (boot-repair pastebin)\n\n*a guide on how to resolve Windows boot-loops using Windows Recovery*\n\n*Windows start-up repair (ran it multiple times, fails multiple times, then says no errors found, but does not solve the problem)\n\n*fixboot and fixmbr in Windows recovery\n\n\n*I can only post 2 links at the moment, so I'll leave this one out. Basically it involved copying registry backups from \\windows\\system32\\config\\RegBack to \\windows\\system32\\config\nWhat I did not try:\n\n\n*\n\n*restore Drive backup and redo the whole process. Reason is, I can't boot up the usb recovery device (screen stays black when I try to boot from it)\n\n\nAdditionally, but probably somewhat unrelated: I had to boot up the Ubuntu Live session with the boot option nomodeset as otherwise the screen stayed black after GRUB (maybe this is related to the recovery device boot problem...).\nWell, that's about as much information as I can recall for now. Any ideas on what I should try?\n\nA: Judging from your grub.cfg file, it looks like you should be seeing three entries for Windows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Windows UEFI bootmgfw.efi\n\n*Windows Boot UEFI loader\n\n*Windows Boot Manager (on /dev/sdc1)\nPlease clarify which of those you've tried, and what the result is for each of them. In some cases, one option will work but others won't, in which case the appropriate thing to do is to ignore the non-functional options, or perhaps take steps to hide them. If you don't see all three of those options, then either I'm mis-reading your grub.cfg file or your GRUB is reading another grub.cfg than the one shown in your Boot Repair output. In the latter case, you might want to track down the file that's actually being read.\nIf none of those entries is working, then something is badly damaged. My recommendation in this case is to begin by undoing whatever Boot Repair has done. Re-launch the program and select the Advanced option to restore backup boot files. This should restore the original Windows boot files -- but given that you've already run Windows' own repair tools, it's unclear if this will help. If you needed to run Boot Repair to get Ubuntu working, then this may break Ubuntu's boot; but then you can work forward in a way that won't damage your Windows boot.\nIf at this point either Windows or Ubuntu doesn't boot, try the USB flash drive or CD-R version of my rEFInd boot manager. If it can boot both Windows and Ubuntu, install it via the PPA or Debian package, which should bypass GRUB entirely. If rEFInd itself launches but doesn't help you boot Windows, then at least you can be pretty sure that it's not a GRUB quirk, but that your Windows boot files are messed up. In this case, I suggest you look for a solution on a Windows forum. Although it was clearly something about the Ubuntu installation or Boot Repair that damaged the Windows files, repairing that damage will have to be done from Windows. (An exception is if you made a backup of your ESP before installing Ubuntu, in which case you can restore that, or at least its EFI/Microsoft directory tree, to fix the problem.)\n", "Q: Get back Documents folder? I deleted my documents and downloads folder. How can I get them back. I don't want them to be like any other folder, I would like it to be like how it used to be where it shows on the side of the filesystem. Any idea on how i can get it back like that.\n\nA: To create a new Documents folder\n\n\n*\n\n*Open home folder\n\n*Right click and create new folder, name it Documents\n\n*Change icon by right click on the Documents folder and select properties. Click on the folder icon, this will bring up a select custom icon window.\nBrowse to File System > usr > share > icons > Humanity > places > 48 & select the 1st folder_documents.svg. This should restore the icon to your Downloads folder\n\n*Then execute gedit ~/.config/user-dirs.dirs in terminal (Press crtl+alt+T to open terminal) or browse to file.

For example, I consider cron a must-have because otherwise I will not have log file rotation. And periodic updates check. \nBut if you don't even want logs, and plan to check updates manually, your case is different. \nSo basically the only correct answer is \"it depends\". Depends on how you want your system behave and on your use case. \nTry to disable services one by one (see @muru comment though --- do not rename the upstart files, add a file with .override extension with just the manual command in it) and see if the system works for you.

Can I make them so that they always appear, regardless of my mouse position?\nThanks!\n\nA: To make your scrollbar always visible, write this in terminal:\nsudo gsettings set com.canonical.desktop.interface scrollbar-mode normal\n\ngsettings is to get/set system settings, and you're setting the scrollbar-mode to normal, you need sudo because you're making changes to the system.\nTo reset to default behaviour:\nsudo gsettings reset com.canonical.desktop.interface scrollbar-mode\n\nYou can also achieve the same via Unity tweak tool.

Setting your scrollbars to normal turns the 'hover to show' off.\n\nA: You have to disable the scrollbar overlay - which means they are always on.

You can confirm that by executing ls -al. From the output you can see that the owner and the group to which the file belongs are set to root.\nIf you try to edit it with your normal user, you wont be able, because the file does not belongs to your user. Again you are able to read the file but not write to it, because of the permissions. You can check them to from the command line with ls -al command. It should be something like:\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root   root       4 Apr  9 07:40 filename\n\nthe first part -rw-r--r-- means that only owner can read and write to file, users from the same group and other user can only read the file.\nHere is a good diagram that describes the meaning of permissions:\n\nIf you wish to be able to edit the file, you must do so as the root user - this is almost always the best way:\nsudo vim filename\n\nIf you wish to edit it as normal user you can assign additional permissions to it, (but you should not do this to system files outside your home directory - use sudo to edit them instead):\nsudo chmod 777 filename\n\nThis way the file will be readable, writable and executable from every user.

So now instead of getting \"nameserver 127.0.0.1\" as the first, last, and only nameserver entry in /etc/resolv.conf, I get \n\nnameserver <ipaddr.frometc.network.interfaces>\nnameserver <another.frometc.network.interfaces>\nnameserver 127.0.0.1\nsearch <domains from /etc/network/interfaces>\nSo now it seems that resolvconf runs, checks the interface order, and adds the entries from /etc/network/interfaces corresponding to the entries above \"lo.dnsmasq\", then calls a dnsmasq process to add those to the file, but that somehow works not quite right and it ignores any interfaces after that.\nWhen I was trying to figure this out I searched, to no avail, about why dnsmasq was ignoring /etc/network/interfaces. (I was certain that dnsmasq was involved because this happened shortly after I installed dnsmasq) I am not sure if that solves your problem, but to me it seemed a little bit cleaner than just removing resolvconf.\n\nA: You can try setting chattr to immutable.\nchattr +i /path/to/filename\n\nTo remove immutable to allow changes again change the flag on the file.\nchattr -i /path/to/filename\n\n", "Q: Installing php5-fpm with php version 5.4.x I'm installing a Lemp stack for the first time, and although I've got everything set up right now, I was hoping to install php 5.4.x to work with my Magento installation.

The root cron run whenever you have logged in or not logged in user as long as your PC is running. So this will solve your problem.\nTo get the current idle time in miliseconds you can install xprintidle:\nsudo apt-get install xprintidle\n\nI have created a simple bash script for you, that you can put to be excuted by the root cron:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nexport DISPLAY=:0\nIDLE_TIME=`xprintidle`\nMAX_IDLE_TIME=3600000\n\nif [ \"$IDLE_TIME\" -ge \"$MAX_IDLE_TIME\" ]; then\n    shutdown -h now\nfi\n\nNote that export DISPLAY=:0 is required in order xprintidle to work correctly under cron. MAX_IDLE_TIME is the max idle time in miliseconds after that the computer will be shut down. 3 600 000 miliseconds is equal to one hour. You can change this value by your needs.\nSo now save this file somewhere on your filesystem (preferably not your home folder, because it may be encrypted).

The first \\ is interpreted as a special character by the shell that tells the shell not to treat the next character, in this case the second \\ not as a special character and pass it on.\nIn other situations a \\ followed by a normal character is treated as an escape sequence that gives the combination special use. For example, \\n takes the pointer to is a new line.\nSee http://linuxcommand.org/wss0060.php for other examples.\nAlso see http://tldp.org/LDP/Bash-Beginners-Guide/html/sect_03_03.html for more explanations.\nHope this helps\n", "Q: How do I search shell command history with a text editor? I know that Ctrl+R let's you search command history, but it's a little primitive. Is there a way to export all my command history (not just the current terminal session, but the full history) to a text file? I could then use a text editor to search it comfortably. Or if the history file already exists, where is it?\n\nA: The bash history is saved in your home directory ~/.bash_history.\nBasically Ctrl + R searches from this file.\n\nA: Try this:\nhistory > output.txt\nless output.txt\n\nThen search by typing / + searchterm\n\nA: From man bash:\nHISTFILE\n    The name of the file in which command history is saved.\n    The default value  is  ~/.bash_history.\n    If unset, the command history is not saved when a shell exits.\n\nSo, the variable HISTFILE will contain the filename where the history will be saved.\n$ echo \"$HISTFILE\"\n/home/user/.bash_history\n\nYou can now search for the pattern:\n$ grep \"vim\" \"$HISTFILE\"\nvim foo.text\nvim bar.text\nvim file.txt\n\nAs @Dennis has pointed out, if you want you can run history -a to append the command history of the running session to the $HISTFILE file.

Issue is, Owncloud uses the apache user (which iswww-data) and of course that user doesn't have the appropriate permissions set on my secondary disk, and I don't want that user to be the owner. So investigating on how to create bind mounts I saw it is possible to set the mount permissions differently to what is set on the primary (not bind) mount.

EOF is not inherently an error condition, but when an EOF is an error it usually means the interpreter thinks your program has ended prematurely--it was anticipating something, which never occurred in your program.\nIf the error message had said the error was an end of line in the backquote substitution, you would probably have immediately recognized the problem (provided you know that ` is called a backquote and and command substitution using a backquoted construct is also called backquote substitution).\nWhy does bash think the file ends too soon, rather than the line? This is because you can actually have newlines (i.e., line breaks) inside a backquote expression:\nek@Io:~$ file `which vim\n> `\n/usr/bin/vim: symbolic link to `/etc/alternatives/vim'\n\nSo what's happening is that bash reads the first backquote expression as\n`expr $f\\* $i\ni=`\n\nwhich is definitely not what you intended!\nThen what you intended as the contents of the second backquote expression it sees outside of backquotes, and sees the following as a second backquote expression:\n`\ndone\necho \"The factorial of $num is $f\"\nelse\necho \"Enter positive number\"\nfi\n\nThis is also not at all what you intended, and furthermore there is no closing backquote, which causes bash to report reaching end-of-file while still inside a backquote expression (EOF in backquote substitution).\nThe solution is not to put a backquote at the very end of the script, of course! Instead, as others have said, simply add the missing backquote where it was supposed to be.\nNote, however, that this must be `, same as the opening backquote. Although the strange formatting displayed in the output of some command-line utilities might convey the impression that what begins with ` ends with ', that is not the case. (I noticed that had at one point written a ' rather than ` for the fix.)\nClosing a [ Command: The [: missing ] Error\nAfter fixing the first problem, you got a prog4: 5: [: missing ] error.\nIn bash, [ is a command (and in fact there is even a separate [ executable, as unlike bash some shells don't provide a [ builtin). Blank space must appear between it and its first argument.\nSimilarly, it is required to pass the closing ] of a [ command as a separate command-line argument. That is, you must have blank space before the trailing ] as well as after the leading [.\nThe line\nif [ \"$num\" -ge 0]; then\n\nshould thus be rewritten to say:\nif [ \"$num\" -ge 0 ]; then\n\nFor more details on [ syntax, see the output of help [ and help test.\n1+1 vs. 1 + 1\nAfter fixing that problem, you'll get another error, which will look something like this (depending, perhaps, on what version of bash you are running):\nbash: [: 1+1: integer expression expected\n\nThe problem is that expr does not understand 1+1 is intended to mean \"the sum of 1 and 1.\" It does not simplify it to 2, so the [ command that subsequently examines it doesn't have an integer to evaluate.\nWhy doesn't the expr utility know 1+1 is supposed to be interpreted as an integer, the sum of 1 and 1? This is because each number and arithmetic operator must be passed as a separate command-line argument to expr:\nek@Io:~$ expr 1+1\n1+1\nek@Io:~$ expr 1 + 1\n2\n\nTo fix this problem, rewrite the line\n    i=`expr $i+1`\n\nto instead say:\n    i=`expr $i + 1`\n\n\nA: In the line\nf=`expr $f\\* $i\n\na backquote (`) is missing.\n\nA: I found some fails on your code, here is a improved one:\nclear\n\nread -p \"Enter a number: \" number\nif [[ \"$number\" =~ ^[0-9]+$ ]]; then\n    factorial=1\n    for ((i=1;i<=$number; i++)); do\n        factorial=$(($factorial * $i))\n    done\n    echo \"The factorial of $number is $factorial\"\nelse\n    echo \"Enter positive number\"\nfi\n\nHere you're the edit list and explaination:\n\n\n*\n\n*You can use read -p \"Promt here: \" myvar instead of printing the prompt before.\n\n*To check if the input is a positive integer (only unsigned digits) you can use this awesome bash regex: [[ \"$number\" =~ ^[0-9]+$ ]] that checks if $numbercontains only digits.\n\n*I indented the code and made verbose the variable names just for readability.\n\n*Instead of a while loop, why not a for loop?

It's plugged into the living room TV. We play a lot of Windows games and I recently discovered the beauty and splendor which is Kodi.\nThe laptop I acquired this weekend from a friend. He got yet another new one and I scored a free laptop. It's not the best, but no complaints here :) \nI just bought the SSD, and plan on putting a fresh install of Windows 7 and kubuntu on it, along with a small ammount of games so they boot really fast.

I have 2 ntfs drives full of data I'd like to be able to access from both OSes that I don't want to lose.\nPlease let me know if there is more information required.\nI'm very excited to break the shackles of M$.\n\nA: There is a not a really good way to \"cut the fat\" off of windows. Since it's not open source, you can't really change anything. If I were you, it would allocate about 60-80GBs to windows, since it is a much larger intall, and have the rest of the space for Kubuntu.\nAs far as the activation key goes, that is only good on one computer (more specifically, it ties to the motherboard, but that is more complicated) so if you want windows, you have to get another copy (somehow, legally or not). As far as accessing files from both OSes, you cant access programs or things like that (so you will have to install them twice, once for each OS), but depending on the format/encoding of the drive, you could be able to access files like .mp4 and .txt or others from both OSes.\nLet me know if this answered all of your questions or not.\n", "Q: Dual monitor set-up and wallpaper not expanding [Ubuntu Gnome] Recently I installed Ubuntu Gnome 14.10 and here's my problem. \nAfter installing Ubuntu Gnome I wanted to set a wallpaper (3840x2160) for my dual monitor set-up (3840x1080).

I can look at the music CD with, say, Rhythmbox and see the song/artist information but I believe it is sourcing this data off the web and not the CD. Is there a way to capture this information off the CD itself or do I know if it is even present? Looking at the 'properties' of the individual CD music files shows nothing under the 'General' information. Also the songs on the CD are simply listed as Track 1.wav, etc; no song titles.

Both are on wired networks.\nEvery time I log into any Ubuntu system or VM (12.04, 14.04, 14.10) on the local network, and most times I insert or remove a USB device (flash drive, webcam, fpga board... anything) my network printer 'spools'—it sounds like clearing the paper path and then moving and re-homing the print head.\nWireshark confirms stuff happens: every time I plug or unplug a usb device, i see BJNP and MDNS traffic broadcast, and then a TCP connection to the printer.\nSo the question is: what causes that to happen, and how can I disable it?\n\nA: I had a similar problem with an Epson network printer. To find out what was causing it, I used netstat to monitor the network connections while inserting a USB device:\nsudo netstat -t -u -a -p -c\n\nOne connection appeared a few moments after the device was inserted: a UDP connection by colord-sane. This binary is part of colord, a \"system service to manage device colour profiles\".\nUnfortunately, disabling this service (at least on 15.04) is more difficult than it would seem. colord is not started directly by the init system systemd. Instead, dbus starts colord, or is asked to start colord by some other service (at least not the printer service cupsd). One way to prevent this is by renaming the relevant service file:\ncd /usr/share/dbus-1/system-services/\nsudo mv org.freedesktop.ColorManager.service org.freedesktop.ColorManager.service.disabled\n\nI don't know what side-effects this action might have. Another possibility is to uninstall colord completely, using\nsudo apt-get remove colord\n\nAs I don't really need colour profile functionality on my Ubuntu device, I didn't investigate what exactly colord does to \"activate\" the printer, or how to teach it not to do so.\n\nA: The problem can be solved for my Epson WF3520 without breaking colord, which seems deeply integrated into most linux systems.\nComment out\n\nnet autodiscovery\n\nin /etc/sane.d/epson2.conf and /etc/sane.d/epsonds.conf (with a # at the start of the line)\nThis may be applicable to other printers through their .conf files as well (\"kodakaio\"/\"magicolor\"?)\nCredits go to: Link1 / Link2\n\nA: I was having the same problem with my Epson WF-3640.  I have a desktop and a laptop both running Ubuntu 20.04 and every time they start up they both trigger the spool/cycle on the printer.  It only lasts about 3 seconds but it got very annoying.\nsudo apt-get remove colord\n\nThe above answer worked for me (thanks) but then I couldn't access settings.  I found these three lines of code which you can run after uninstalling colord.  I hope the developer fixes this problem.\nsudo apt-get remove gnome-control-center\nsudo apt autoremove\nsudo apt-get install gnome-control-center\n\n", "Q: No wifi on newly installed ubuntu I just installed ubuntu on my laptop.

It sounds ridiculous, but I could only use the internal display and one external display, or shut off the internal one and use a second external display.\nBut I have to admit, I'm not sure if mine has a nvidia card in it. So it might be not the solution for your laptop.\n", "Q: opposite of eject command? I have a ton of CDs to image, and I just got curious. I can eject with the eject command.

I have a few years old Dell with 2GB RAM. I'm running Windows Tech Preview 10 on another partition.\n\nA: I had the same problem for a while and fixed it as follows:\nI run the command sudo iotop in the terminal. The output of his command showed that most of the \"mysterious\" I/O was being performed by the processes updatedb/mlocate and updatedb/locate.\nAs I understand it, the function of these cron-launched process is to maintain up-to-date an internal linux db, by means of which the system makes the location of files much more efficient.\nMy solution was to deactivate the execution of this processes by means of the commands\nsudo chmod -x /etc/cron.daily/mlocate\nsudo chmod -x /etc/cron.daily/locate\n\nHowever, to avoid the degradation of the db for file-location, I periodically execute locate and mlocate at a suitable moment.

Any way to use windows media player on ubuntu? I've PC with dual OS , windows and Ubuntu.\nI installed windows for games, also i installed lots of games in windows.\nExcept gaming i do every work on Ubuntu so i spend more time on Ubuntu.\nNow problem is that when i open Rhythm-box , it syncs every sound file of games.\nSo in my Rhythm-box play-list more than half media files are of just games.\nIts very annoying to me click on  next button 4-5 times to play music.\nAlso my musics are located in 'NTFS' partition.\nSo is there any solution available for this problem??\nAlso is there any way which we can install windows media player on Ubuntu??\nOr any other media player which is much better than Rhythm-box and windows media player???\nSorry for bad English.\nScreen-shot for reference:- http://prntscr.com/6rp055\n\nA: The Windows Media Player itself can be made to work but is not a good fit for Ubuntu. As I don't like rhythmbox neither, so I just use VLC player to play all of my media.\nThe advantage of VLC (for me, might be  a disadvantage to you) is that it doesn't contain a media library at all!\nTo remove rhythmbox and install VLC player:\nsudo apt-get purge rhythmbox*\nsudo apt-get install vlc\n\n\nA: You can use gsettings from the terminal.\nFirst open terminal and then you will have to find the current location with this:\ngsettings get org.gnome.rhythmbox.rhythmdb locations\n\nYou will get one or more paths like this ['file:///home/user/Music']\nIn your case if the NTFS partition is mounted in the /dev/sda* it will something like ['file:///dev/sda*'] so you will need to choose exact folder where you have just music and not the sounds.\nTo change the path you need to use set syntax so it will look like this\ngsettings set org.gnome.rhythmbox.rhythmdb locations \"['file:///home/user2/MoreMusic']\"\n\n\nA: I don't like Rhythmbox.  I use Banshee instead (which comes as the default on Linux Mint and, as far as I'm concerned, should come as the default on Ubuntu).  Banshee has a similar appearance to Rhythmbox, but I find that it runs smoother and better.  You can find it in the Ubuntu Software Center by simply searching Banshee.  Then, to remove Rhythmbox, you can go into the \"Installed\" section of the Ubuntu Software Center, click to see the Sound and Video section, click on Rhythmbox, and just click Remove.\nWhen adding your media to Banshee, you'll go to Media>Import Media and choose to import from Folders.  Instead of importing your entire NTFS partition, go to where you actually have your music and import those folders.  By importing your entire NTFS partition, no matter which media player you use it will take anything that's on your NTFS partition, including game media.\n", "Q: expanding --vg-root(dm-0) I added more space to my Ubuntu VM through vSphere (to 1TB).

Currently, the best option seems to be xdotool. I can move to the next tab using  \nxdotool key ctrl+Page_Down\n\nthe only problem is if there is only a single tab open. Then the above command outputs garbage into the terminal window. The garbage are these three characters ;5~ (which is probably the character representation for Ctrl+Page_Down).\nHow can I avoid xdotool or gnome-terminal from outputting these three characters?\n(Off topic: I would also like to know if anyone knows if there are any other ways to determine the number of open tabs in a gnome-terminal window)\n\nA: From a shell in the terminal you want to count the tabs on something like this might work\nps -h --ppid `ps -ho ppid $$` | grep pts | wc -l\nThe tabs share a common parent process and will be associated with a pseudo-terminal (pts). The $$ variable contains the process id of the invoking shell. The -h switch tells 'ps' to suppress the default header line and the -o switch tells it to use a custom format to return just the parent process id. The backticks say return the value of this command. So the output of the backticks will be the numeric process id of the parent of the current shell. Passed to 'ps' with the --ppid switch returns all processes with that parent. Filter with grep for TTY association and count lines.\n\nA: method #1\nOneliner to be executed in the same window that you wann a count :\nexpr  $( echo $( xprop -root | awk '/_NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW/ && /0x/ {print $5}'  | xargs xwininfo -all -id | awk '/child/ || /children/ {print $1}' ) ) / 2\nHere's the one-liner in action and reports correctly 5 open tabs\n\nExplanation:\nWhat I've noticed about gnome-terminal is that when you run xwininfo -all -id 0xXXXXXXX (where 0xXXXXX is numeric id of that window), it reports 3 children for one single window, 5 children for a window with 2 tabs, 7 children for 3 tabs, and so on. See the pattern ? If you do integer division (i.e., only get the whole number when you divide children by 2, you get the number of tabs).\nSo that's what that line is basically doing expr $(stuff that gets number of children) / 2\nHow do I get the number of children ? I search the output of xprop -root for the string that has numeric id of active window, give that numeric id to xwindowinfo -all -id as argument, and then search that output for number of children. \nAdvantage of this method ? Gives exact number of tabs in the window you run it. Disadvantage ? only works in gnome-terminal, doesn't work in sakura\nmethod #2 (crude and not as good)\nThere's another way that I've found but it only works for one window. If you run who -a you will see something like this:\nserg  + pts/7        2015-04-11 08:47 00:02       17540 (:0)\nserg  + pts/2        2015-04-11 08:27 00:12       17540 (:0)\nserg  + pts/12       2015-04-11 08:50 00:08       17540 (:0)\nserg  + pts/13       2015-04-11 08:56 00:01       17540 (:0)\nserg  + pts/14       2015-04-11 08:58   .         17540 (:0)\n\nNotice the + sign ? Yup, if you are in a single window, then you could run this command in that same window who -a | grep \"+\" | wc -l. Now, Kenneth Stevenson properly mentioned that they share same pid and are associated with pseudo terminal ? Yup, all windows do that. So if you have another window open, this method will give you incorrect result.\n", "Q: Installation of Ubuntu in an external hard disk drive I have an 1 TB external hard disk drive and was thinking if it was possible to install Ubuntu in it and transfer it from one PC to another.\nAfter an extended search I can't decide if it is possible or not.

(I've got a USB disk just like that but I've never tried anything but BIOS machines, as I rarely encounter UEFI machines and if I meet one, I put them in BIOS mode and revert back when I leave)\nProcedure is exceedingly simple:\n\n\n*\n\n*Insert the HDD\n\n*Boot the LiveCD\n\n*Install like you would install any other machine and install grub, swap, / and /home on there\n\n*Ensure fstab uses blkids\n\n*Install as many applications as you want, but stay away from any proprietary modules (aka drivers), just standard Linux kernel modules...

If anything goes wrong, just restore the system backup and hold those packages at their current level.  (thought that's highly unlikely as you're running pure nVidia)\n", "Q: Bit Rate issues on ubuntu 12.04 Centrino Advanced-N 6205 wireless card I'm having some issues with my wireless connection.\nI'm using Ubuntu 12.04:\n$ cat /etc/lsb-release \nDISTRIB_ID=Ubuntu\nDISTRIB_RELEASE=12.04\nDISTRIB_CODENAME=precise\nDISTRIB_DESCRIPTION=\"Ubuntu 12.04.5 LTS\"\n\nKernel Version:\n$ uname -a\nLinux dtabar-laptop 3.13.0-49-generic #81~precise1-Ubuntu SMP Wed Mar 25 16:32:15 UTC 2015 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux\n\nThe issue is with the bit rate, it's stuck between 1Mb/s and 6 Mb/s as you can see:\n$ iwconfig \nwlan0     IEEE 802.11abgn  ESSID:\"NewSocrates\"  \n          Mode:Managed  Frequency:2.462 GHz  Access Point: E8:DE:27:42:35:82   \n      Bit Rate=6 Mb/s   Tx-Power=15 dBm   \n      Retry  long limit:7   RTS thr:off   Fragment thr:off\n      Power Management:off\n      Link Quality=70/70  Signal level=-37 dBm  \n      Rx invalid nwid:0  Rx invalid crypt:0  Rx invalid frag:0\n      Tx excessive retries:0  Invalid misc:116   Missed beacon:0\n\nsudo lshw -class network output:\n*-network\n   description: Wireless interface\n   product: Centrino Advanced-N 6205 [Taylor Peak]\n   vendor: Intel Corporation\n   physical id: 0\n   bus info: pci@0000:03:00.0\n   logical name: wlan0\n   version: 34\n   serial: 84:3a:4b:33:bf:5c\n   width: 64 bits\n   clock: 33MHz\n   capabilities: pm msi pciexpress bus_master cap_list ethernet physical wireless\n   configuration: broadcast=yes driver=iwlwifi driverversion=3.13.0-49-generic firmware=18.168.6.1 ip=192.168.0.105 latency=0 link=yes multicast=y es wireless=IEEE 802.11abgn  resources: irq:47 memory:f1c00000-f1c01fff\n\nAnything I'm missing?

What's my next step? Thanks!\n\nA: Have you tried rebooting the machine?\nWhat usually happens (if it's a dual boot install) is when you reboot your machine, the computer asks which operating system do you want to use.\nI'm aware Ubuntu has a possible setting to run itself as a program from inside of Windows, but I haven't tried that myself.\n", "Q: How to change directory for $HOME My home folder (~ and $HOME) points to /home/user , how do I change this directory?  \nI tried\nHOME=/new/dir\n\nBut this only works until I start a new shell.  \nI also tried looking for definitions in /etc/environment, ~/.profile, and /etc/profile.d/ but I didn't find HOME defined anywhere.  \nI also looked here, but I'm not interested in moving it to a separate partition, I merely would like to change the directory it points to. \n\nA: HOME is usually derived from the user's entry in /etc/passwd. You can use usermod to change this entry, but only if your user is not logged in. Therefore, you need to either:\n\n\n*\n\n*Set a root password and login as root from a TTY, or\n\n*Boot to recovery mode (see How do I reset a lost administrative password? for an example guide)\n\n\nIn either case, once you have a root shell, do:\nusermod --move-home --home /path/to/new/home your-username\nchown your-username:$(id -gn your-username) /path/to/new/home -R\n\nThis should move your home directory to the new location and ensure correct ownership (which the usermod command should do, the chown is just in case). Now logout/reboot and login as your user.\n\nA: To just change the home dir for the user USER to /some/other/dir use\nsudo usermod --home /some/other/dir USER\n\nYou need to make sure /some/other/dir actually exists and has proper permissions. No files will be copied.\nIf you want to move the contents of the old home dir to the new one you can use.\nsudo usermod --move-home --home /some/other/dir USER\n\nReplace /some/other/dir with the path of the new home folder. If it doesn't exist yet it will be created. The content of the old $HOME will be moved to the new one.\n", "Q: Why all zip files should be marked as executable?

(e.g. for the 'cd' command) I am a novice user and I am trying to install Oracle Java. The process calls for me to access /usr/local/java, but here is the problem. I get as far as /usr/local, then this is the message I get:\nleonard@leonard-MT6452:/usr/local$ dir\nbin  etc  games  include  java  lib  man  sbin  share  src\n\nleonard@leonard-MT6452:/usr/local$ cd /java/\nbash: cd: /java/: No such file or directory\n\nleonard@leonard-MT6452:/usr/local$ rm -r ~/java\nrm: cannot remove ‘/home/leonard/java’: No such file or directory\n\nHelp?\n\nA: There are two ways a path can be specified.\nAbsolute paths\nAbsolute paths always start with a /. This means the starting point of the path specification is fixed. No matter where your current location is, an absolute path will always point to the same location. The only exception is when you use a shell shortcut, such as ~, at the start, where the shell will replace ~ with what is usually the absolute path of your home directory. Even though it doesn't look like ~/bin starts with a /, when the shell presents its final form, it will have a leading /.\nRelative paths\nRelative paths never start with /. Their starting point is the current directory, so where you end up depends on where you start. They may start with any subdirectory. In addition:\n\n\n*\n\n*You can use . and .. to refer to the current directory and the parent directory. You can also use these within absolute paths, just not at the start (/foo/../bar is the same as /bar, and both are absolute paths, but ../foo is not absolute).\n\n*You can use a setting (environment variable) called CDPATH (usually unset), specifically for the cd command. If you add a directory to CDPATH, then you can use a relative path (not starting with . or ..) to it from anywhere with cd.\n\n\n\nTo summarize:\n\n\n*\n\n*cd /usr/local/java will always take you to the same spot, as does cd /usr/local/./java.\n\n*cd java will take you different places depending on where you are and what CDPATH contains. (Note that only cd should be affected by CDPATH - for other commands, ./java and java should mean the same thing.)\n\n*cd ./java will take you to the directory named java within the current directory.\n\n*cd ../java will take you to the directory named java within the parent directory.\n\n*cd ~/java will always take you to the directory named java in your home directory. In this case, the path is absolute, but because the shell expands the ~ before cd operates on it, different users will end up at different places.\n\n\nA: You don't need the initial / while at /usr/local/ to go to /usr/local/java. The correct command using relative pathname:\nleonard@leonard-MT6452:/usr/local$ cd java/\nleonard@leonard-MT6452:/usr/local/java$ pwd\n/usr/local/java    \n\nYou can also take help of bash_completion by just typing cd j (provided there is no other directory started with j) and then hit Tab, cd java/ will be printed.\nAdditionally you can use the absolute path from anywhere:\ncd /usr/local/java\n\nThe / at the start of a file path always refers the root directory of the file system hierarchy. As there is no file named /java you were getting /java/: No such file or directory error message.\n", "Q: Upgrade to 15.04: is it automatic? Is it safe to reinstall alongside windows?

I always do that myself: every new release I re-install over the old release. And I also always pick the \"something else\" option, format / and /home and add in my data partition without format (that one holds all my files).  I like my OS to be clean and all software I installed over the past 6 months, sometimes never used or used once will be deleted.\nBasically: burn the new OS to a DVD or USB stick, boot from it, install and pick \"something else\" or \"replace 14.10\" in the installation options. Just make sure to make a backup of anything important. There is a chance you mess up setting it up, having a backup of your files it your best bet in getting your data back quick and efficiently. \n", "Q: Create an alias for a directory while working in virtual environment I've checked this.\nBut right now I'm working in a virtual env.\ncam@cam:~$ cd Desktop/django-user3\ncam@cam:~/Desktop/django-user3$ source newenv/bin/activate\n(newenv)cam@cam:~/Desktop/django-user3$ cd superlists\n(newenv)cam@cam:~/Desktop/django-user3/superlists$ \n\nNow i need to add an alias so that when i enter \ncam@cam:~$ cd $DJANGO3\n\nI need to get here.\n(newenv)cam@cam:~/Desktop/django-user3/superlists$ \n\nbut instead of this long path i need to see a shorter one.\n\nA: To shorten the prompt, one way is to set PROMPT_DIRTRIM:\n$ cd /usr/share/man/man1\n/usr/share/man/man1 $ PROMPT_DIRTRIM=3\n.../share/man/man1 $\n\nPROMPT_DIRTRIM, when set, limits the number of directories shown in the prompt path, replacing earlier parts with ....\nThere are other ways, such as removing unnecessary elements from them (such as the hostname).

I want to turn my old PC into a cloud storage server with Ubuntu. Please keep in mind that I'm new to Ubuntu so please if you can keep the tutorial short and sweet. Thanks in advance! :D\n\nA: Owncloud\nSeems to be a good solution for you. It worked for me for Ubuntu based operating systems and it provides an easy to install process which I reproduce over here for your convenience but have in mind that Owncloud provides enough information on their support site at: https://doc.owncloud.org/server/7.0/admin_manual/installation/installation_wizard.html among other useful resources.\nIt is a self hosted service like a Dropbox account but hosted in your own server and with limits based on your home server's limits (hard disk drive space, microprocessor speed and memory amount).\nIt looks like a too difficult install process but it is as easy as downloading a single file, place it in your public html folder and write the proper address in the web browser's address bar. The next are pure instruction's webáges after which you'll have it installed. \nI own an already installed Owncloud service in both a home and web servers. If you wish I can provide you an account in order to you check the properties of the Owncloud.\nGood luck!\nInstallation Wizard\nWhen ownCloud prerequisites are fulfilled and all ownCloud files are installed on the server, the last step to complete the installation is running the Installation Wizard. Open your Web browser to your new ownCloud installation.\n\n\n*\n\n*If you are installing ownCloud on the same machine as you are\naccessing the install wizard from, the URL will be\nhttp://localhost/owncloud, or https://localhost/owncloud if you have\nenabled SSL.\n\n*If you are installing ownCloud on a different machine, you’ll have to\naccess it by its hostname or IP address, e.g.\nhttp://example.com/owncloud.\n\n*If you are using a self-signed certificate, you will be presented\nwith a security warning about the issuer of the certificate not being\ntrusted which you can ignore.\nYou will be presented with the setup screen:\n\nRequired Settings\nUnder create an admin account you must enter a username and password for the administrative user account. You may choose any username and password that you want.\nStorage & Database\n\n\n*\n\n*Click Storage & Database to see all of your database options, and to\noptionally change the default data storage directory.\n\n*The database you want to use must already be installed, and you must\nhave a database admin user and password.\n\n*Enter any arbitrary name for the Database name. This must be a\ndatabase that does not already exist.\n\n*If you are not using Apache as the web server, it is highly\nrecommended to configure the data directory to a location outside of\nthe document root. Otherwise all user data is potentially publicly\nvisible!\n\n\n\nDatabase Choice\n\n\n*\n\n*For a guideline on which database system to choose, and on pointers\nhow to set them up for being available for PHP/ownCloud, see Database\nConfiguration\n\n*Note that you will only be able to choose among the PHP database\nconnectors which are actually installed on the system.\n\n*It is not easily possible to migrate to another database system once\nyou have set up your ownCloud to use a specific one. So make sure to\ncarefully consider which database system to use.\n\n*When using MySQL/MariaDB or PostgreSQL you have two options regarding\nthe database name and user account you specify:\nYou can specify either an admin or the root user, and the name of a database which does not yet exist. This lets ownCloud create its own database; it will also create a database user account with restricted rights (with the same username as you specified for the administrative user, plus an oc_ prefix) and will use that for all subsequent database access.\n\nThere are restrictions as to what characters a database name may or may not contain; see the MySQL Schema Object Names documentation for details);\n\nFinish Installation\n\n\n*\n\n*Once you’ve entered all settings, click “Finish Setup”\n\n*ownCloud will set up your cloud according to the given settings\n\n*When it’s finished, it will log you in as administrative user and\npresent the “Welcome to ownCloud” screen.\n\n\nSetting Strong Directory Permissions\nFor hardened security we recommend setting the permissions on your ownCloud directory as strictly as possible. This should be done immediately after the initial installation. Your HTTP user must own the config/, data/ and apps/ directories in your ownCloud directory so that you can configure ownCloud, create, modify and delete your data files, and install apps via the ownCloud Web interface.\nYou can find your HTTP user in your HTTP server configuration files. Or you can create a PHP page to find it for you. To do this, create a plain text file with a single line in it:\nName it whoami.php and place it in your /var/www/html directory, and then open it in a Web browser, for example http://localhost/whoami.php. You should see a single line in your browser page with the HTTP user name.\n\n\n*\n\n*The HTTP user and group in Debian/Ubuntu is www-data.\n\n*The HTTP user and group in Fedora/CentOS is apache.\n\n*The HTTP user and group in Arch Linux is http.\n\n*The HTTP user in openSUSE is wwwrun, and the HTTP group is www.\n\n\nNote\nWhen using an NFS mount for the data directory, do not change its ownership from the default. The simple act of mounting the drive will set proper permissions for ownCloud to write to the directory. Changing ownership as above could result in some issues if the NFS mount is lost.\nThe easy way to set the correct permissions is to copy and run this script. Replace the ocpath variable with the path to your ownCloud directory, and replace the htuser variable with your own HTTP user:\n#!/bin/bash\nocpath='/var/www/owncloud'\nhtuser='www-data'\n\nfind ${ocpath}/ -type f -print0 | xargs -0 chmod 0640\nfind ${ocpath}/ -type d -print0 | xargs -0 chmod 0750\n\nchown -R root:${htuser} ${ocpath}/\nchown -R ${htuser}:${htuser} ${ocpath}/apps/\nchown -R ${htuser}:${htuser} ${ocpath}/config/\nchown -R ${htuser}:${htuser} ${ocpath}/data/\n\nchown root:${htuser} ${ocpath}/.htaccess\nchown root:${htuser} ${ocpath}/data/.htaccess\n\nchmod 0644 ${ocpath}/.htaccess\nchmod 0644 ${ocpath}/data/.htaccess\n\nIf you have customized your ownCloud installation and your filepaths are different than the standard installation, then modify this script accordingly.\nThis lists the recommended modes and ownership for your ownCloud directories and files:\n\n\n*\n\n*All files should be read-write for the file owner, read-only for the\ngroup owner, and zero for the world\n\n*All directories should be executable (because directories always need\nthe executable bit set), read-write for the directory owner, and\nread-only for the group owner\n\n*The / directory should be owned by root:[HTTP user]\n\n*The apps/ directory should be owned by [HTTP user]:[HTTP user]\n\n*The config/ directory should be owned by [HTTP user]:[HTTP user]\n\n*The data/ directory should be owned by [HTTP user]:[HTTP user]\n\n*The [ocpath]/.htaccess file should be owned by root:[HTTP user]\n\n*The data/.htaccess file should be owned by root:[HTTP user]\n\n*Both .htaccess files are read-write file owner, read-only group and\nworld\n\n\nTrusted Domains\nownCloud will take the URL used to access the Installation Wizard and insert that into the config.php file for the trusted_domains setting. All needed domain names of the ownCloud server go into the trusted_domains setting. Users will only be able to log into ownCloud when they point their browsers to a domain name listed in the trusted_domains setting. An IPv4 address can be specified instead of a domain name. A typical configuration looks like this:\n'trusted_domains' =>\n  array (\n   0 => 'localhost',\n   1 => 'server1',\n   2 => '192.168.1.50',\n),\n\nIn the event that a load balancer is in place there will be no issues as long as it sends the correct X-Forwarded-Host header.\nThe loopback address, 127.0.0.1, is whitelisted and therefore users on the ownCloud server who access ownCloud with the loopback interface will be able to successfully login. In the event that an improper URL is used, the following error will appear:\n\nFor configuration examples, refer to the config/config.sample.php document.\n", "Q: how make bootable usb flashdrive of Xubuntu to later be burned to a cd I am extremely new to Lenux and flavors.

I'm using Unity. If there's any desktop version out there that supports this I'd be curious to know about it.\nFor example, say I have 3 terminals open. Whenever I click on the terminal icon on the taskbar, Ubuntu opens the last terminal I opened manually. If I click on the icon again, it shows me all of the terminals open and I can then open another manually. \nIs there any way to see all of the terminals at once without having to open each one separately? This gets incredibly cumbersome when I have 3 or 4 terminals open.\n\nA: \"If there's any desktop version out there that supports this I'd be curious to know about it.\"\nI just recently switched from using lightdm to using gdm.  I have not fully decided which one I prefer yet, and may yet go back to lightdm.  One advantage of gdm: when you click on \"Activities\" at the top left hand corner, it shows not only your programs which you have marked as favorites on the left, but also shows ALL windows that are open.  It shows every instance of terminal, every instance of Firefox, and so on, and you can choose which one to select.  This isn't exactly what you're asking for, but it does get all the open windows in one click.  You may want to try gdm to see if you like it.\nIn order to try gdm, open a Terminal.  Use the following command:\n\nsudo apt-get install gdm\n\nOnce you have it, it will inform you that there are multiple instances of a display manager installed.  Select OK by hitting Enter (if that doesn't work try Space).  Then it will ask you which to use as your default.  Choose gdm with the arrow keys and hit Enter again.  There are a few ways to get it to switch to gdm now.  I find that the way that is the least buggy is to simply reboot your computer; if you've selected gdm as your default, it will automatically boot into gdm.  The other way is to enter into the Terminal:\n\nsudo service gdm restart\n\nThe login screen will look different in gdm, but it's self-explanatory.\nIf you decide that you would rather go back to lightdm, I find that the simplest way to get back to it is to prompt the choice for which one should be used as default again by using the following commands:\n\nsudo apt-get remove lightdm\nsudo apt-get install lightdm\n\nOnce lightdm is reinstalled, it will ask you which one you want as your default; choose lightdm.  You can then, from within lightdm, remove gdm with:\n\nsudo apt-get remove gdm\n\nI do not recommend removing gdm from within gdm, nor removing lightdm (should you decide you prefer gdm) from within lightdm.\n", "Q: Timing limiter for execution of commands in Bash/Shell Script I have a shell script which looks like this:\necho firstOutput\nread -s\ncommand0\ncommand1a\ncommand1b\ncommand1c\necho secondOutput\ncommand2\n\ncommand1a, command1b, command1c are individual commands but they can be executed in arbitrary order and are a group in the sense of the following explanation.\nI now want to improve it so the script continues even if one command gets stuck. command0 needs to be executed first and it got 8 seconds to operate. If it doesn't make it within 8 seconds, the script shall continue to command1[a-c] which together have 5 seconds to operate.

I haven't found a straightforward fix, but I was able to boot from a live CD, mount the hard drive, apt-get remove network-manager, and apt-get install wicd.  Wicd seems to have some problems coming up on startup, but if I start in manually, it finds and connects to my wireless just fine.\nHere's the step-by-step instructions, for anyone with similar issues who either is also having problems with their ethernet (which was also an issue on my computer):\nReboot and load the live CD.  Go to \"Try Ubuntu\"\nOpen a terminal, and type:\nsudo su -\nmount /dev/sda1 /mnt\nmount --bind /proc /mnt/proc\nmount --bind /dev /mnt/dev\nmount --bind /sys /mnt/sys\nchroot /mnt\napt-get remove network-manager\napt-get install wicd\n\nFrom here, you can do any other package (un)installations.  Then,\numount /mnt{/proc,/dev,/sys,}\numount /mnt\n\nAnd reboot.\nFor reference, I am using an Intel wireless interface.  Rebooting from different kernels did not solve the problem, but booting from the Live CD was fine, as was working from Debian or Gentoo.\n\nA: The first thing you want to do when, after an update, some hardware doesn't work, is to reboot to the previous kernel, which is kept. You can find them in the boot menu. This kind of thing can happen from time to time with proprietary drivers and is one of the main reasons they are so intensely hated by many. Very often, though, you can \"fix\" it by simply booting the previous kernel for a while until the problem is fixed with another update. If you're able, you should file a bug on Launchpad.net, providing as much details as possible about your system and hardware. \n\nA: you can restart the network-manager service using the command\n/etc/init.d/network-manager restart\n\nor try restarting the network service as well.\n/etc/init.d/network restart\n\n", "Q: Upgrade BitTorrent Sync I just received a notification for BitTorrent Sync 2.0 to upgrade.

I searched Google and did what they said but it didn't work for me.\nIf it's possible for the bash script to run in a new terminal window that will display the output, please tell me what I have to do to achieve that.\n\nA: A simple way of doing that is to add those lines to rc.local in your system.\nFor that you need root or sudo rights.

What I found was loopback tests whether the TCP/IP suite of our system is working properly or not and pinging our IP makes sure that NIC is working fine. This is okay but I wish to know its working with respect to OSI reference model i.e., what are the layers that involved in this.\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: When everything is working correctly, they should have the same effect.\nThe two are on different \"interfaces\" - the lookback address is on the loopback interface which should be present always (unless you've done something really freaky with your config).  The local IP address is on one of your other network interfaces.\nIf that interface didn't come up, then that ping will fail but the loopback IP should still work.\nFurthermore, depending on how your network interface is set up - specifically whether it's getting an auto IP address via something like DHCP, or whether you've given it a static IP - the interface might come up but not have the IP address you expect, in which case pinging the IP address will also fail.\n\nA: *\n\n*lo is the loop-back address and will respond whether the hardware works or not and does not get transported to the physical layer.\n\n*Any other address will only respond if the actual hardware is working and connected so this will go to the physical layer.\n\n*There is also a way to create a hardware loop-back address if you need it and that will go to the physical layer as well without testing the cabling part of the physical layer.\nSo layers go from transport to physical depending on the kind of address you ping.\n\nA: There are 7 OSI layers: physical, datalink, network, transport, session, presentation and application layers. \nSo if my understanding is correct ( and please correct me if I am wrong, I do want to learn ), pinging loopback address tests the network card (physical layer), while pinging your own IP address or other IP addresses involves network layer. Pinging external ip addresses gets onto transport level and if we can surf internet with browser such as firefox that is already up in the  application layer\n", "Q: Ubuntu 11.04 fails to boot in Macbok After installing Ubuntu 11.4 in a Macbook 5,2 I get a blinking folder with a question mark at boot.\nThe installation was successful erasing the entire drive, but the computer fails to boot Ubuntu, I launched the Live USB and inserted these commands in the terminal:\nsudo apt-get install efibootmgr\nsudo efibootmgr\nsudo efibootmgr -o 0\n\nAlso modified the sudo nano /etc/default/grub adding GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=\"libata.force=noncq\"\nAnd inserted this command:\nsudo update-grub\n\nHowever it returns:\ncannot stat aufs\n\nThe blinking folder is still present.\nHow can I fix this?\n\nA: Ubuntu 11.04 has reached End of Support in 2012.

See below for explanation, details, and alternatives.\nWhy sudo Is Clearing JAVA_HOME\nWhen you run a command with sudo, by default your environment is not passed intact. Most environment variables are removed, for security, and this is usually desirable. As man sudoers says, in the section on \"Command environment\":\n\nSince environment variables can influence program behavior, sudoers\n  provides a means to restrict which variables from the user's\n  environment are inherited by the command to be run. There are two\n  distinct ways sudoers can deal with environment variables.\nBy default, the env_reset option is enabled. This causes commands to\n  be executed with a new, minimal environment. On AIX (and Linux systems\n  without PAM), the environment is initialized with the contents of the\n  /etc/environment file. The new environment contains the TERM, PATH,\n  HOME, MAIL, SHELL, LOGNAME, USER, USERNAME and SUDO_* variables in\n  addition to variables from the invoking process permitted by the\n  env_check and env_keep options. This is effectively a whitelist\n  for environment variables.\nIf, however, the env_reset option is disabled, any variables not\n  explicitly denied ....\n\nLetting JAVA_HOME Through One Time\nOne option, if you rarely run mvn spring-boot:run as root and prefer not to change your configuration at all, is simply to pass on the value of JAVA_HOME manually:\nsudo JAVA_HOME=\"$JAVA_HOME\" mvn spring-boot:run\n\nWhen you run that:\n\n\n*\n\n*The shell performs parameter expansion and quote removal, replacing \"$JAVA_HOME\" with the value (i.e., contents) of JAVA_HOME. If that contains no blank spaces, the quotes are not necessary (their purpose here is to prevent word splitting).\n\n*sudo is called with three arguments: JAVA_HOME=..., where ... is the value of JAVA_HOME when you ran the command; mvn, and spring-boot:run.\n\n*sudo recognizes variable=value syntax, and knows to run mvn with JAVA_HOME set to the specified value. (spring-boot:run is passed as the first command-line argument to mvn).\n\n\nTo pass all your environment variables through, you can run sudo -E mvn spring-boot:run, but this is potentially less secure and not ideal because JAVA_HOME is the only variable whose value you need preserved (besides the handful of variables whose values are automatically preserved even with env_reset).\nLetting JAVA_HOME Through Every Time\nAlthough you could disable env_reset in your sudoers file, this would pass almost all a user's environment variables through every time sudo is run, and for this reason is not recommended.\nInstead, I recommend you edit your sudoers file and add an appropriate env_keep line after the env_reset line.\n\n\n*\n\n*Please do not edit /etc/sudoers directly. Instead, you should always use the visudo command for this, which checks to ensure your syntax is correct (preventing the creation of an invalid sudoers file which locks down sudo until fixed).\n\n\nRun:\nsudo visudo\n\nThis will use your default command-line text editor. If you want to use a different editor, you can run visudo with it assigned to the VISUAL environment variable. For example:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo VISUAL=nano visudo\n\n*sudo VISUAL=gedit visudo\n(VISUAL isn't so named after the \"vis\" in visudo; instead, it's the environment variable for specifying default text editors. You can also use the EDITOR variable, but VISUAL takes priority if set.)\nRunning visudo opens up a temporary copy of your sudoers file in a text editor; on exit, changes made to this copy are written to /etc/sudoers.\nFind the line that says:\nDefaults        env_reset\n\nAdd a line just under it, saying:\nDefaults        env_keep = \"JAVA_HOME\"\n\n(If you already have an env_keep line, add JAVA_HOME to the quoted list of allowed variables. The variable names are separated from one another with spaces.)\nSave the file and quit the text editor. Now, when users run commands with sudo, the JAVA_HOME environment variable will be preserved.\n", "Q: Xubuntu doesn't lock screen anymore It was working and one day it decided not to work anymore. I can click on the lock screen button or use Ctrl+Alt+Del but no reaction. How to fix that?\nI am using Xubuntu 14.04\n\nA: Lock is a function of the screensaver. It will stop working if your screensaver is not running - for example, if it gets removed your start-up applications.\nGo to: Settings > Session and Start-Up > Application Autostart\nAnd check: [x] screensaver.\nOtherwise, it may not be likely your screensaver would stop working unless it has actually been removed. It is operated by the script called xflock4, which you will find in the directory /usr/bin/. It checks for three different possible screensavers and will run whichever one happens to be there: xscreensaver, light-locker or gnome-screensaver. To rule out the possibility that your problem is that you somehow lost your screensaver, simply attempt to install one (e.g. with the command 'sudo apt-get install xscreensaver'). If the program is already installed, it will tell you so. It seems the xfce4 panel button to 'lock screen' runs xflock4.

I've got apache2 and PHP5 installed on the HTTP server and MySQL on the MySQL server. I'm trying to install phpmyadmin on the apache2 server but when I try, I get error 2002 (hy000) because /var/lib/mysql/mysql.sock cannot be found, obviously because it isn't installed on that server.\nI understand phpmyadmin requires both apache2 and MySQL to run, however, is there a way I can install it on either server while still keeping the servers separated? Ideally on the apache2.\n\nA: phpmyadmin should run on the server that has Apache2 and PHP running, but it is able to connect to an external database server. Answer taken from here:\nIn the config file, change the \"host\" variable to point to the external server. The config file is called config.inc.php and it will be in the main phpMyAdmin folder. There should be a line like this:\n$cfg['Servers'][$i]['host'] = 'localhost';\nJust change localhost to your server's IP address.\n\nA: I did manage to fix it.

From there go to Applications, then the Ubuntu Software Center at the bottom. Under the \"Ubuntu Software\" and \"Updates\" sections, add a check to the un-checked sources, like Restricted, Multiverse, Proposed, and Backports.

In the meantime, STOP USING THE DISK. Some possible configurations of that disk are DANGEROUS, and you might end up trashing important data if you write more data to the disk.\nThe simplest fix is to wipe the disk and start over. If you've got important user data, back up first. To do so safely, mount whatever you can read-only.\nIf you really need to recover it in place, it may be possible, but will require a number of checks and expertise to figure out the correct course of action. If you want to start this, please show the output of:\nsudo fdisk -l /dev/sdb\n\n...and also, the same parted output you showed, but use unit s print rather than simply print.\nFYI, I expect that you used a GPT-unaware tool to partition the disk, which left you with an MBR disk with leftover GPT data. This configuration confuses parted. Somehow you managed to create new GPT partitions without damaging the MBR data. Windows' partitioning tools are known to create a fresh MBR without wiping GPT data, so installing Windows will sometimes do this.\n", "Q: powerd.service takes eternity to start at boot $ systemd-analyze blame\n    1min 30.182s powerd.service\n          7.348s plymouth-quit-wait.service\n          7.270s NetworkManager-wait-online.service\n          3.419s systemd-udev-settle.service\n          1.639s apache2.service\n          1.610s schroot.service\n          1.029s mysql.service\n\n(I dropped all things <1 sec)\nWhat powerd.service is supposed to do?

What does sr stand for? When I first started using Ubuntu, I think my CD drives were mapped through /dev/cdrom0 and /dev/cdrom1, etc. but looking at things today, you can see they now come through on a sr prefix:\n$ ll /dev/{cdrom,sr*}\nlrwxrwxrwx  1 root root      3 Feb 10 09:15 /dev/cdrom -> sr0\nbrw-rw----+ 1 root cdrom 11, 0 Feb 10 09:15 /dev/sr0\nbrw-rw----+ 1 root cdrom 11, 1 Mar 27 10:30 /dev/sr1\n\nI'm just curious what this stands for. TLDP isn't being very helpful here; and it still lists sd as \"SCSI drive\", and I think it more commonly means \"serial drive\" these days.\nWhat does \"sr\" stand for? Why does /dev/cdrom still exist?\n\nA: \nLinux SCSI Disk support module = sd_mod\nLinux SCSI Tape support module = st\nLinux SCSI CDrom support module = sr_mod\nLinux SCSI generic support module = sg\n\nSo, most likely, that stands for SCSI CDrom\nSource\n\nI've noticed that this doesn't fully address the question.\nAs you can see, /dev/cdrom is just a symbolic link to /dev/sr0, which is the actual device.\nThe naming of a character device is dependant on the module which initializes it: SCSI CD-ROMS are handled by the sr_mod module, and they're named after the module itself (srX).\nIf your CD-ROM drive happened to be an IDE drive, the actual device's name would have been /dev/hdX.\nSo since there are multiple interfaces through which a CD-ROM drive could be attached to the system, /dev/cdrom is used to always point to the first CD-ROM device (SCSI, IDE or whatever), most likely to give the drive an unique common interface for whatever needs to use it in the system.\n\nCDROM device names are not maintained by the uniform CDROM layer but rather by each individual protocol stack. In the case of the SCSI subsystem, device names are maintained by the sr driver while the IDE subsystem maintains device names with its central \"ide\" driver (i.e. not by the ide-cd driver). USB and IEEE1394 cd devices names are maintained by their respective stacks. This may partially explain why the /dev/cdrom is often a symbolic link to the appropriate subsystem's device name.\n\nSource\n\nA: Reading this, the letter r appears to derive from ROM.

It can be installed from the Software Center or from command line:\nsudo apt-get install qtqr\n\n\nA: The device is simply a camera, the image processing and QR reading is made in the computer's \"dirver\". If do you want to use it in Linux as it were a \"good\" reader that has the reading part on the device (It acts as a keyboard that types all what you scan), you can follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install the required packages: sudo apt-get install zbar-tools xdotool wmctrl\n\n*Type on a terminal gksu gedit /etc/udev/rules.d/00-usb-qreader.rules\n\n*A text editor will open up, copy and paste these lines:\n   ACTION==\"add\", SUBSYSTEM==\"video4linux\", ATTRS{idVendor}==\"1871\", ATTRS{idProduct}==\"0101\", ENV{XAUTHORITY}=\"/home/<your_username>/.Xauthority\", ENV{DISPLAY}=\":0\", OWNER=\"<your_username>\", RUN+=\"/usr/local/bin/usb-qreader\", SYMLINK+=\"qreader\"\n   ACTION==\"remove\", SUBSYSTEM==\"video4linux\", ATTRS{idVendor}==\"1871\", ATTRS{idProduct}==\"0101\", ENV{XAUTHORITY}=\"/home/<your_username>/.Xauthority\", ENV{DISPLAY}=\":0\", RUN+=\"/usr/local/bin/usb-qreader\"\n\n\n*Press Ctrl+H to find and replace all <your_username> occurrences by your username.\n\n*Save the file and close the text editor.\n\n*Type on a terminal gksu gedit /usr/local/bin/usb-qreader\n\n*On this file put these lines (you can customize it if you know what are doing):\n#!/bin/bash\n\nZBAR_SETTINGS=\"--raw --nodisplay\" # Put here the options\nALWAYS_ON_TOP=\"true\"              # Keep the zbar window always on top\nEND_CHARACTER=\"Return\"            # Character sent after code scan (\"Return\", \"Tab\", \"space\", \"\")\nTYPEIN_WINDOW=''                  # Title of the window onto type.

You can use zbarcam from zbar-tools to read QR codes.\nzbarcam will attempt to decode barcodes and QR codes from a video stream, and will output the contents of the scanned codes into stdout.\n\nA: In 2020, you should use CoBang to scan QR code. This app was written recently by me, to catch new technologies in Linux desktop.\nHow to install in Ubuntu 20.04:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:ng-hong-quan/ppa\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt install cobang\n\n", "Q: Why is it unsafe to delete old kernels? I have run out of space on my boot drive, so I decided to remove old kernels. I found this page which describes exactly what I should do: Lubuntu Documentation: Remove Old Kernels.\nI have deleted the oldest kernel manually and now it is okay, but I don’t understand one thing: at the end of the article there is some code that can delete all old kernel versions, but it is marked as for advanced users only.\nI don’t really understand what the danger is here. It sounds silly, but they seem to say that there might be more than one kernel used by a specific machine at the same time.\nIs it possible that different applications on my Ubuntu machine can use different kernels simultaneously? Why is deleting all old kernels automatically considered to be dangerous?\n\nA: Removing old kernels is not inherently unsafe, but if you remove all your kernels and reboot, you'll be left at an angry Grub screen. Fixing that takes significant know-how (like that but with an apt-get install linux-generic at the end).\nThe first time you do this is quite thrilling but the people looking to clean up their Grub menu or recover some disk space aren't looking for thrills.\nThe danger comes from users copy-pasting a block of code that —unbeknownst to them and without acknowledging the risks— doesn't apply. There are many examples of detecting old kernels and few are perfect. Even my latest effort still has its pitfalls. And we're talking about an issue that can be fixed; many posts on Ask Ubuntu could lead to permanent data loss if used incorrectly.\nWe try to safeguard against damage by signposting the risk to make users conscious of potential problems. In the best case scenarios, the user will be prepared and equipped to deal with a problem and in the worst case, at least they can't complain that they weren't warned.\n\nA: The old kernels are part of packages. If you just remove /boot/vmlinuz-3.13.0-44-generic you will leave package crumbs all over.  \nFirst, find out which kernel you are running. Do NOT delete anything with this value is its name:  \n$ uname -r  \n3.13.0-49-generic  \n\nYMMV. Then, ask dpkg what it knows:  \n$ dpkg -l linux-*\n\nSome of those packages can be removed, but what else is there? Using one line extracted (on MY system) from the output of the dpkg -l linux-*:  \n ii  linux-image-3.13.0-44-generic       3.13.0-44.73           amd64                  Linux kernel image for version 3.13.0 on 64 bit x86 SMP\n\nNow we will see what other packages have -3.13.0-44 in their names:  \n$ dpkg -l *-3.13.0-44*\n\nOnce you do a final check to ensure that the current kernel (uname -r) is NOT on the list of packages, you can start removing them through the package management system of your choice.\n\nA: It's not unsafe. Using Linux, you can do exactly what you want if you know the right commands.\nIn the /boot directory, you can do a simple ls -la to have a long listing as well as to find any hidden files or directories (which are not supposed to be there if there are any!!).\nFrom this information, you can assess the dates and old versions' files. Do not remove all of them, but the oldest files which correspond to same version.\nAt some point, I was thinking that it might be possible that, if you have compiled your kernel from source, then you will need to tweak a new one. The .config file, which I don't think is the case as per your explanation, will stay there.\nSo, if it happens that after deleting the old files corresponding to a single version and after rebooting your machine, it might be possible that you encounter a kernel panic. \nThe simple solution is to boot the machine with a live USB or CD/DVD Linux. chroot into it, and re-build the kernel with tools like dracut.\n\nA: The last time I removed my old kernels, I borrowed an old code snippet. Well, this code snippet had required me to reboot after installing the new kernel, so I was left without a kernel. Luckily, I had caught this before rebooting, but as others said, I may have been left with the \"angry grub screen\".\nLong story short, it's simply something that can be easily messed up, resulting in a bricked system that can be hard to recover.\n", "Q: Opening Ubuntu from the hard drive I have an HP box with a 32bit processor and 80gb hard drive that currently has XP pro as the OS. I downloaded Ubuntu to the hard drive  but can't get it to open or boot. I welcome any suggestions.\n\nA: *\n\n*Make a bootable pendrive using any available software (I prefer  LiLi for windows).\n\n*Reboot and press F2/F8 to go to\nBoot Menu.\n\n*Change Boot Priority (Set USB/Flashdrive first using arrow keys).\n\n*Exit and save changes. Reboot.\n\n*Now you will be presented with ubuntu logo and installation proceeds (Try ubuntu/Install Ubuntu).\n\n*If you have created partitions previously, then you can install ubuntu in any one of them.\n\n*Else, you need to create separate partition for ubuntu. Use GParted for doing that.\n\n*How to use GParted ?, Install it while ubuntu is running on your USB from apt-get install command (You should choose 'Try Ubuntu option for this').\n\n\nA: If you are looking to test ubuntu without installing, you can use VirtualBox, a free program provided and maintained by Oracle.  This way you can create a virtual machine on your windows box and install it there.  You would mount the ISO you downloaded as a CD image in the VM's configuration.\nIf you wanted to install ubuntu you will need to burn the ISO to a thumb drive or dvd.  If you are using DVDs I recommend imgburn and for usb drives I like to use Rufus.  These are personal preference though.\n", "Q: Dual booting to windows 8.1 failing after first boot My brand new Lenovo X250 came with a Windows 8.1 pre-installed.  I wanted to dual boot with Ubuntu 14.04 as I did on my previous computer. I started by disabling UEFI, removing Windows 8.1 , changing partition table to the older (was it msdos?) formatting and reinstalling windows, and installing Ubuntu to the other partition. \nEverything worked nicely as well as booting the first time to Windows. But after that I cannot boot to Windows 8.1. After selecting windows form grub, the display remains dark and nothing happens. Ubuntu boots nicely without any problems. \nI was confused and formatted all partitions and tried to install everything again from scratch leading exactly to the same thing! \nBoot repair or switching between legacy and UEFI booting doesn't seem to help either. \nWhat could be the problem here? \n\nA: Have you tried updating the grub boot loader with:\nsudo update-grub\n\n", "Q: my desktop seems to be outside of my 40`` tv in 1920x1080? My Ubuntu 14.04 LTS desktop seems to be outside of my 40\" TV in 1920x1080! If I select a lower resolution like 1366x768 it is ok.\nWhat is the problem here and how can I set up my system to see the full desktop in the high resolution?\n\nA: If you have \"overscanning\" enabled on your TV you will need to disable it.  Otherwise sometimes there is a zoom feature.  TVs use it to help make DVDs look better on your TV but it does mess up desktops.  I had the same problem on my Toshiba and my mint/Kodi mediaserver.  \nTry looking in the setting for Overscan or zoom and see if that helps.\n", "Q: Force \"bad\" (not 0) return code of terminal command? I have a framework written in python, and for testing purposes I basically want to do a subprocess (aka shell call) ... that should simply come back with a RC != 0. I tried to invoke some non-existing executable; or to run \"exit 1\"; but those are for some reason translated to a FileNotFoundError.\nSo, what else could I do to trigger a return code != 0 (in a \"reliable\" way; meaning the command should not suddenly return 0 at a future point in time).\nI thought to \"search\" for a binary called exit, but well:\n> /usr/bin/env exit\n/usr/bin/env: exit: No such file or directory\n\n\nA: You can create a new return code with the command bash -c \"exit RETURNCODE\", replacing \"RETURNCODE\" with any number. Note that it will be trimmed to an 8bit unsigned integer (0...255) by (RETURNCODE mod 256)\nYou can check the return code of the last shell command inside the terminal(!) with executing echo $?. The \"$?\" variable contains the most recent return code and \"echo\" prints it to the standard output. \n\nA: If you're looking for a system command that always returns a non-zero exit code, then /bin/false seems like it should work for you. From man false:\nNAME\n       false - do nothing, unsuccessfully\n\nSYNOPSIS\n       false [ignored command line arguments]\n       false OPTION\n\nDESCRIPTION\n       Exit with a status code indicating failure.\n\n\nA: After some more testing, I found that my problem was not on the \"Linux\" side. \nPython has a module shlex; which should be used to \"split\" command strings. When I changed my subprocess call to use the output of shlex.split() invoking \"bash exit 1\" gives me what I need.\n", "Q: USB 2.0 not working on Ubuntu, but working fine in GRUB Devices connected using the motherboard's USB 2.0 won't work in Ubuntu 14.04, although they work fine in GRUB 2.\ndmesg spits out something along those lines when I connect a keyboard:\nusb 7-3: new full-speed USB device number 6 using ohci-pci\nusb 7-3: device descriptor read/64, error -32\nusb 7-3: device not accepting address 6, error -32\nusb 7-3: new full-speed USB device number 7 using ohci-pci\nusb 7-3: device not accepting address 7, error -32\nusb 7-3: new full-speed USB device number 8 using ohci-pci\nusb 7-3: device not accepting address 8, error -32\nusb 7-3: new full-speed USB device number 7 using ohci-pci\nusb 7-3: device descriptor read/8, error -32\nusb 7-3: device descriptor read/all, error -32\nusb usb7-port3: unable to enumerate USB device\n\nConnecting the same keyboard to the motherboard's USB 3.0 works fine.\n\nA: I needed to enable the input/output memory management unit (IOMMU) in the BIOS.\n", "Q: Does Ubuntu Touch ship with proprietary code? Does Ubuntu Touch (i.e., the system and pre-installed apps) contain proprietary code? Or is it 100% FLOSS?\n\nA: ubuntu-touch is licensed under the GPL v2. I guess the kernel will include some proprietary blobs for drivers (as does the Ubuntu desktop distribution). The core applications are also released under the GPL. Pre-installed apps, will probably depend on the device. E.g. the Telegram client is FLOSS, but the server side is not (yet?) released under a FLOSS license.\nMy bq acqaris 4.5 came pre-installed with a game (cut the rope -free) which is obviously proprietary...but then again contrary to other phones you can remove whatever does not fit your taste without the need to resort to \"rooting application\" of unknown origin.\n", "Q: Problem in installing Ubuntu I have downloaded Ubuntu 14.4, my laptop is 32-bit 512 MB RAM, and followed the way guided for installing Ubuntu 14 by using USB  bootable making by universal USB installer, but it not get installed, the boot shows following message. \nSYSLINUX 4.07 EDD 2013-07-25 COPYRIGHT (c) 1994-2014 H.

Lately however, she has been experiencing a problem that has me, her, and both of our respective colleagues confounded and confused. \nWhenever she's at work using her job's WiFi, she connects using PuTTy, but just gets a \"Server unexpectedly closed network connection\" error. She is never prompted for a password before the error. If she sets up her phone as a hotspot that she connects her laptop to, she can successfully log in. If she's at home or at my place, she can also log in using the same laptop (without hotspot). She can also log in using her phone while that phone is connected to her job's WiFi.\nIn the auth.log on the server, I see her connection attempt coming in, but the only post is that made is one stating\nrefused connect from [IP-ADDRESS] ([IP-ADDRESS])\n\nThere is no more information in that log.\nStuff we tried so far (including \"I seriously doubt this will work, but why not\"-attempts):\n\n\n*\n\n*Delete PuTTy registry inputs to reset the session keys on her computer.\n\n*Delete and add her server user from scratch.\n\n*Run ssh-keygen -A to update the keysets, with sudo service ssh restart to update changes.\n\n*Try to login using just IP-address and not web address.\n\n*Try to login using both the form [username]@[serveraddress] as well as just [serveraddress].\n\n*Adding a SecureShell addon in Chrome to replace Putty (same result, though with a slightly different error:\nssh_exchange_identification: Connection closed by remote host NaCl plugin exited with status code 255\n\nAny other ideas to what might be going on here?\nEDIT: \nThe contents of /etc/ssh/sshd_config, and the output if iptables -L was requested:\n# Package generated configuration file\n# See the sshd_config(5) manpage for details\n\n# What ports, IPs and protocols we listen for\nPort 22\n# Use these options to restrict which interfaces/protocols sshd will bind to\n#ListenAddress ::\n#ListenAddress 0.0.0.0\nProtocol 2\n# HostKeys for protocol version 2\nHostKey /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key\nHostKey /etc/ssh/ssh_host_dsa_key\nHostKey /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ecdsa_key\nHostKey /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key\n#Privilege Separation is turned on for security\nUsePrivilegeSeparation yes\n\n# Lifetime and size of ephemeral version 1 server key\nKeyRegenerationInterval 3600\nServerKeyBits 1024\n\n# Logging\nSyslogFacility AUTH\nLogLevel INFO\n\n# Authentication:\nLoginGraceTime 120\nPermitRootLogin yes\nStrictModes yes\n\nRSAAuthentication yes\nPubkeyAuthentication yes\n#AuthorizedKeysFile     %h/.ssh/authorized_keys\n\n# Don't read the user's ~/.rhosts and ~/.shosts files\nIgnoreRhosts yes\n# For this to work you will also need host keys in /etc/ssh_known_hosts\nRhostsRSAAuthentication no\n# similar for protocol version 2\nHostbasedAuthentication no\n# Uncomment if you don't trust ~/.ssh/known_hosts for RhostsRSAAuthentication\n#IgnoreUserKnownHosts yes\n\n# To enable empty passwords, change to yes (NOT RECOMMENDED)\nPermitEmptyPasswords no\n\n# Change to yes to enable challenge-response passwords (beware issues with\n# some PAM modules and threads)\nChallengeResponseAuthentication no\n\n# Change to no to disable tunnelled clear text passwords\n#PasswordAuthentication yes\n\n# Kerberos options\n#KerberosAuthentication no\n#KerberosGetAFSToken no\n#KerberosOrLocalPasswd yes\n#KerberosTicketCleanup yes\n\n# GSSAPI options\n#GSSAPIAuthentication no\n#GSSAPICleanupCredentials yes\n\nX11Forwarding yes\nX11DisplayOffset 10\nPrintMotd no\nPrintLastLog yes\nTCPKeepAlive yes\n#UseLogin no\n\n#MaxStartups 10:30:60\n#Banner /etc/issue.net\n\n# Allow client to pass locale environment variables\nAcceptEnv LANG LC_*\n\nSubsystem sftp /usr/lib/openssh/sftp-server\n\n# Set this to 'yes' to enable PAM authentication, account processing,\n# and session processing.

Most of the people there use Linux almost religiously, and I believe a large majority of the people there would be quite angry if they could not use SSH connections. \n\n*The head of IT there, who has a doctorate in informatics, had a 5 minute look at the problem and was also stumped. I think he of all people there should know if it was company policy to block port 22. \n\n*My server does register an inbound connection request, and actively refuses it. If port 22 was blocked, would this not result in there not being any updates in auth.log at all?\n\n\nA: It's likely that what's ending up happening is that the network administrator for their work network is blocking TCP port 22 outbound, and UDP port 22 outbound, to block SSH access.  This is done for a security concern of data being 'uploaded' from the internal network to a server that is not controlled by the organization.  This is also done as a matter of workplace policy.\nAs an IT security professional, it is my duty to NOT provide answers which would compromise the shared server's security or the workplace's security, but i'm giving you three options here and identifying which ones I recommend in the sections below.  One violates policy of the workplace for the girlfriend likely, and also detracts from your server's security, the other two are potential other options.\n\nOption 1: Try and run a web-facing shell client, or set sshd to use port 80.\nNOT RECOMMENDED\nThe only solution in this case is to run a web-facing shell client of some sort, but you'll likely need a web server.  The other solution, proposed by Nitin J Mutkawoa of putting your SSH server to port 80 is another option.  Both of these options open you to several security risks, including but not limited to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Putting SSH on a HTTP port means that MANY servers may try and access a web page on the IP address but will instead hit an SSH connection, which will be a security risk as service scanners see that.\n\n*Putting what should be considered a 'secure' service on a web port will open you to web-based attacks against the port\n\n*Putting SSH on the web facing system will open you to a lot of bruteforce attack vectors.\n\n*Putting a web-facing web based shell client will open you to bruteforce attempts as well\n\n*Putting a web-facing web based shell client up will open you to attack vectors from whatever the 'client' is written in (Java, PHP, etc.) which may include but is not limited to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Remote Code Execution vulnerabilities\n\n*Privilege Escalation vulnerabilities\n\n*Denial of Service vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\nThis also opens your girlfriend to policy violations in the workplace by doing something which workplace policy has set to deny. She could face disciplinary action up to and including getting fired.  For this reason as well as the security reasons above you should not implement this option.\n\nOption 2: Don't try and circumvent workplace IT policy\nRECOMMENDED\nAs an IT security professional myself, who has had to terminate network access due to policy violations of other individuals at a workplace in the past, my recommendation is that your girlfriend does not try and SSH to your shared server from a work environment/network.  If there are any types of auditing being done on the network, then the network audits may show that someone is attempting to SSH to an unsecure, unvetted server.  While you or your girlfriend may individually not have any malicious intent, most workplace \"Network/Computer Acceptable Use Policies\" will include that you will not be doing personal items on the network without authorization or absolute necessity.  Another thing is likely to state \"You shall not use certain services such as: [list]\".\nI would recommend that you review the acceptable use policy for the girlfriend's workplace, and determine whether she would be violating this policy, enough so that she could be facing disciplinary action, such as removal of network access, removal of computer access, or potential dismissal.  Do not try and circumvent the policy because your girlfriend could be fired by circumventing it.\n\nOption 3: If the SSH is needed for work-related tasks, contact supervisors/management to see if restriction exemptions can be given to the girlfriend.\nALSO RECOMMENDED\nIf the access to your shared SSH server is a requirement for the workplace, then your girlfriend needs to talk to her supervisor to determine whether there is a violation of policy by allowing access as such.  It would then have to be discussed by management whether or not they can give access, and then from there determines whether it's safe/sane or not to allow the access through the network.\nThis is likely the second safest option\n\nA: refused connect from [IP-ADDRESS] ([IP-ADDRESS])\n\nThis particular message is emitted by the TCP wrappers library when it decides to reject a connection. Ubuntu's sshd is built to use TCP wrappers.\nCheck the two files \"/etc/hosts.allow\" and \"/etc/hosts.deny\" on the ssh server. You have an entry in one of those files which causes ssh connections from that address to be rejected. See the Ubuntu man page for these files.\n\nA: something or someone probably installed software on the server which seemed to change some defaults in the linux network system, do you have a log of all installed software since the incident started. I do, and before you uninstall the suspect see what the suspect changed when it was installed in your system\n\nA: Try restarting the ssh service:\n/etc/init.d/ssh restart\n\n", "Q: Sound from video is very low whereas mp3 file sound is good I have tried in VLC as well as totem, when I play a mp3 files sound is good but sound from video is muffled. I am using hp pavilion dv6. Please let me know for any other info. I am new to ubuntu\n\nA: I run into this sometimes, where certain media plays softer or louder than other media.  The simple fix I use is to open up the Sound Settings and set it to higher than 100% manually (you may have to click \"Allow Louder than 100%\" to do this, depending where you access the volume settings from).  I find that when I push the volume louder than 100%, videos that are otherwise too quiet can be heard much better.  If you do this simple fix, you may find that you'll have to turn it down again for your MP3's or it will get distorted/be too loud.\nSee below, I have where 100% is circled, and it's possible to go beyond it.\n\n", "Q: Is it safe to remove old vmlinuz.* files from /boot In /boot there are a lot of vmlinuz.* files going back 4 years.

I have an I/O error every time I copy folders and files from a partition to a backup harddrive . \nSo how can I safely backup this data to my backup HDD?\n\nA: First of all, if your drive is experiencing I/O errors you should check if your drive is healthy enough. I/O errors might be localized only on a/some specific bad block/bad blocks, but having one/some is how a drive failure usually starts.\nYou can use smartctl to check your drive's S.M.A.R.T. status, which provides many informations about the drive's overall conditions, most interestingly about the reallocated / current pending sectors count. You can install smartctl by installing the package smartmontools:\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install smartmontools\n\nFor SATA drives, you can check your drive's S.M.A.R.T. status by running:\nsudo smartctl -a -d <device_file>\n\n*<device_file> = device file to which your drive is mapped to (in the form of /dev/sdX; you can check this by running lsblk);\nFor IDE drives, you can check your drive's S.M.A.R.T. status by running:\nsudo smartctl -a <device_file>\n\n*<device_file> = device file to which your drive is mapped to (in the form of /dev/sdX; you can check this by running lsblk);\nThe most important indexes to be checked are Reallocated sector count and Current pending sector count. The former provides the number of the drive's \"dead\" sectors, while the latter provides the number of the drive's \"almost dead\" sectors which will be reallocated if a further read attempt on them fails.\nIf the disk is a little aged, those numbers are not likely to be 0, which is the ideal condition. How alarming those numbers actually are it depends, expecially on the drive's age and size; consider that each \"dead\" sector on most hard drives equals to 512 B worth of storage space lost already, but most of all an already high number is usually prone to increase more quickly and it's usually an indicator of a close fail.\nAside from that, you can try with ddrescue. If the partition containing the file(s) you're trying to recover is the root partition, do this from a Live DVD, since the target filesystem must be mounted read-only.\nAlso beware that reading/writing a non healthy drive might ruin it further. ddrescue is meant to do as less damage as possible, but there are no guarantees.\nFirst, if the target partition is mounted, unmount it:\nsudo umount /media/<username>/<partition_mount_point>\n\n*<username> = your username; <partition_mount_point> = partition's mount point (you can check this by running lsblk);\nRemount the target partition as read-only:\nsudo mkdir /media/<username>/ddrescue && sudo mount -o ro /dev/<sdXY> /media/<username>/ddrescue\n\n*<username> = your username; <sdXY> = block device to which the partition is mapped (you can check this by running lsblk);\nCreate a directory in which to copy the recovered file(s) (in this case it's a \"recovered\" folder in your home):\nmkdir ~/recovered\n\nRun ddrescue:\nddrescue /media/<username>/ddrescue/<file_path> ~/recovered\n\n*<username> = your username; <file_path> = file's path in the target partition;\nAnd repeat this last step for each file you wish to recover.\nOnce done, unmount the target partition and remove the temporary folder:\nsudo umount /media/<username>/ddrescue && sudo rmdir /media/<username>/ddrescue\n\n*<username> = your username;\n", "Q: After switching from gdm to lightdm my screen turns off when I come to the login I tried to change my Display Manager from gdm to lightdm. After a system restart everything was normal until I got to the login place.\nInstead of seeing the login screen I only heard the sound of the login appearing and the whole screen shut down. The computer was working but the screen didn't work.\nI suppose the system isn't communicating with the screen and I am not sure what to do and how to make my Ubuntu work again normally because now I can't use it. I can't even log in my account before the screen turns off and this is every time.\nDespite that My computer still works when I choose to start my Windows from the Boot Manager (which is the only part of Ubuntu that works without the screen turned off). Please help me.\n\nA: It's hard to know exactly what is going wrong, but here are a couple easy ideas that might help:\nTo start off, when you can't access a GUI you can switch to a shell command prompt with Ctrl+Alt+F1, where you can log in using your user name (not display name) and password.  It then functions like Terminal would.  You can switch back to the GUI to see if it's working yet with Ctrl+Alt+F7.  So, for the course of the following possible fixes, you'll need to go into Ctrl+Alt+F1 to enter commands if you have no functioning GUI.\nDo you inadvertently have both gdm and lightdm running at the same time?  To make sure you do not, use the following command:\n\nsudo killall gdm\n\nNow try to restart lightdm with the following:\n\nsudo service lightdm restart\n\nIf you don't want to use gdm at all, you may want to enter the following to uninstall it:\n\nsudo apt-get remove gdm\n\nIf gdm is already uninstalled and you're having this issue, try reinstalling lightdm using:\n\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall lightdm\n\nYou can also do this with:\n\nsudo apt-get remove lightdm\nsudo apt-get install lightdm\n\nIf you still can't see a GUI after you have tried all of the above, you may need to install the Ubuntu desktop.  To do this use:\n\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop\n\nIf it has already been installed (you will know this because the second item in the last line of that process will read \"0 newly installed\"), then you may want to reinstall Ubuntu desktop using:\n\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall ubuntu-desktop\n\nI hope at least one of those ideas works.  If at any point you wish to reboot from the Shell without having to use your power button, you'll need to switch to root and then give the command to reboot.  You'll end up doing this chain of commands:\n\nsudo -s\nreboot\n\n", "Q: GNOME shell on 3.16 for ubuntu 14.04 I am trying to install gnome-shell 3.16 on ubuntu 14.04.2 with kernel version 3.16.\nI was only able to upgrade gnome-shell from 3.10 to 3.12.2.

I see this Ask-Ubuntu post How can I install Windows after I've installed Ubuntu? but using Gparted is little hard for me.\nPlease explain this to me, step by step using live-USB?\n\nA: You seem to have not just only a GPT but also a UEFI installation. In that case there will be no overwritten MBR bootloader, which is what the link in your question is mostly about.\nI'm pretty sure that machine shipped with Windows 8, so you should have followed the instructions in my answer on How to use manual partitioning during installation? and kept Windows 8.\nIf I wasn't entirely clear: You shouldn't be concerned about the bootloader but installing the OS you want correctly with UEFI enabled. If Windows 7 installs without flaws, do that, else get your Windows 8 Recovery or install from Windows 8 media. I heard Microsoft now offers 8.1 media for download on its website even for OEM installs (because they also don't like OEM bloatware).\n\nA: The installation of Windows 7 in dual boot has been unambiguously described in the link that you have mentioned in your question.\nIf you want to know how GParted works, check the following steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*To launch gParted you may use either of the methods:\n\n\n*\n\n*the Dash (Ubuntu 11.04 and next): click the Ubuntu logo in the top-left corner of the screen, then type gparted and click on the gParted icon that will appear.\n\n*or System->Administration->gParted menu (Ubuntu 10.04)\n\n*or by typing  in a terminal\ngksudo gparted\n\n\n\n*Then create partition for Windows 7 (atleast 15-20 GB) and proceed for installation accordingly.\nYou may just wish to go through this resource I found: GParted partitioning- Full Tutorial\n\nA: You just need a free space on hard disk, you can manage partition for your windows 7 OS from the windows OS installer. Use Disks (it's an application)  to make a partiton with free space. Notice that you cannot install Win 7 on GPT formatted disks.\n\nA: *\n\n*Before starting please backup your files, because re-sizing and creating partition can lead to loss of data.\n\n*After that Open Gparted.\n\n*Select the disk with largest amount of free space and click on \"Move/Resize the selected partition\" choose how much space you want to allocate to your windows 7 installation. \n\n*When you are satisfied click on Resize/Move.\n\n*Nothing has changed yet, in order to apply the changes click on the green check mark \"Apply All Operations\".\nNow you have unallocated space and your Ubuntu installation. \nClose GParted.\n\n\n*Now put your windows installation USB and reboot to your windows installation.\n\n*Choose language, keyboard and timezone for your windows and click next.\n\n*Read and accept the license and click next\n\n*Select the Costum(Advanced) option.\n\n*You can now see the unallocated space, select it and click \"Drive options(Advanced)\" at bottom right cornor.\n\n*Click New.\n\n*Click Apply.\nAt this point windows will create an additional partition called \"System reserved\".\n\n\n*Click next and the installation will begin.\n\n\nWhen your Windows installation has completed, you will notice that the grub menu will not appear.\n\n\n*To fix that download Ubuntu and make a bootable USB. Boot to Live mode, download bootloader, run it and choose the recommended fix.\n\n\nAnd you are done.\nNow if you restart the grub menu will appear. You can now choose between booting to windows or ubuntu.\nYou can also check this video out\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5LMoa1OK9Q\nHope it helps\n\nA: No need of commands, use EasyBCD for adding grub again to boot menu.\n\n\n*\n\n*Install windows 7 on a separate drive (Ubuntu previously installed on another drive)\n\n*After windows installation Ubuntu will not boot.\n\n*PC will boot into windows automatically.\n\n*Enter into windows and install EasyBCD for windows\n\n*Open EasyBCD and select add boot entry.\n\n*Select grub2\n\n*Give any name\n8.select drive to load.( give automatic or select the drive of your Ubuntu installation)\n8.OK and close EasyBCD.\n\n\n9.done and reboot .\nYou can find new boot option and enter into it ,your grub is there. \n\nA: *\n\n*Boot into a Ubuntu LiveUSB/CD. \n\n*Open Gparted and shrink your /dev/sda2/ to have enough space for the Windows installation.\n\n*Create NTFS storage partition if necessary.\n\n*Now restart and boot into a Windows installation media in UEFI mode.\n\n\nAssuming that you have a UEFI based system, it would be better to install Windows to an unallocated disk partition. So the Windows installer could automate the creation of additional partitions such as EFI partition, recovery partition etc.\n\n\n*\n\n*Continue and follow the Windows installer until it is finished.\n\n*Now boot back into a Ubuntu Live Media.\n\n*Chroot into your old Linux file system as follows..\n\n\nMount your Linux root.\nsudo mount /dev/sdaX /mnt/ (/dev/sda2 in your case)\nMount boot partition\nsudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/boot\nBind these directories, so grub can find your Windows installation.\nsudo mount –bind /dev /mnt/dev\nsudo mount –bind /dev/pts /mnt/dev/pts\nsudo mount –bind /proc /mnt/proc\nsudo mount –bind /sys /mnt/sys\n\nThen sudo chroot /mnt\nIf you successfully chrooted, then.. \n\n\n*\n\n*Reinstall/Recover Grub\n\n\ngrub-install --efi-directory=/boot/efi /dev/sda\nReferences:\n\n\n*\n\n*Reinstall/Recover Grub after installing Windows after Ubuntu\n\n*Boot CD/USB in UEFI mode: See under the section 'Decide whether you want to install in UEFI mode or Bios mode.'\n", "Q: ath10k installation I have exhausted google on how to do this, compounded by being a beginner.\nI am trying to install this module.\nI have a nice new Acer Nitro (which will be even nicer once I remove dependency on win 8.1), with Atheros Qualcomm QCA61x4 wifi/bluetooth card, which seems to pop up with the same signature 168c:003e as the QCA6174, so I am hoping this module will work. \nI have tried with windows drivers and ndiswrapper but this didn't work for me.\nI have also tried upgrading the kernel to 3.19 but that didn't seem to fix it.

(I have a fresh 14.04 install)\n\nA: Not a complete answer (similar situation - ath10k/QCA6174 on a Fedora 22, 4.0 kernel), but more resources:\nhttps://wireless.wiki.kernel.org/en/users/drivers/ath10k points to:\nhttps://github.com/kvalo/ath10k-firmware.\nLooking at dmesg, I can get firmware-4.bin loaded (albeit untested), when place at:\n/lib/firmware/ath10k/QCA6174/hw2.1\n\nHowever, I also get:\nDirect firmware load for ath10k/cal-pci-0000:03:00.0.bin failed with error -2\ninvalid firmware magic\nDirect firmware load for ath10k/QCA6174/hw2.1/firmware-3.bin failed with error -2\ncould not fetch firmware file 'ath10k/QCA6174/hw2.1/firmware-3.bin': -2\n\nSo something still appears to be missing in this setup. Next step is to rename a long filename firmware-3.bin_xxxxxx to firmware-3.bin\nPS (reload ath10k kernel module):\nsudo rmmod ath10k_pci\nsudo modprobe -v ath10k_pci\n\nThen take your pick of iwconfig or NetworkManager.\nSo the steps to a complete installation are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download drivers in https://github.com/kvalo/ath10k-firmware.\n\n*sudo cp -r QCA6174 /lib/firmware/ath10k/\n\n*cd /lib/firmware/ath10k/QCA6174/hw2.1\n\n*sudo cp firmware-5.bin.SW_xxxxxx firmware-5.bin\nThis step may change as driver is developed. xxxx and -5 are evolving.\n\n*sudo rmmod ath10k_pci\n\n*sudo modprobe -v ath10k_pci\nAfter these steps I could connect to a WPA2 WiFi router and everything is working okay in an Acer v5 vn7-591g black nitro.\n\nA: I was able to get my Qualcomm Atheros 61x4 running on a ubuntu 15.04 clean install.

I have just found out that /dev/null is a file and not a directory.\nI'm just wondering if it has an actual file size.\n\nA: /dev/null is not really a file. It's a character device!\n$ ls -l /dev/null\ncrw-rw-rw- 1 root root 1, 3 Apr 10 09:53 /dev/null\n\nThe first letter c of the permissions string (crw-rw-rw-) indicates this. For regular files, it would be a - instead.\nSo in easy words: /dev/null is not a file but a virtual device mapped to this path in the file system, which has the only purpose to swallow and vanish data - like a black hole.\nIt can also be used as input though, then it acts like an empty file (size 0) and immediately returns an EOF (End Of File). \nTherefore you can not really say that /dev/null has a specific file size, as it's not a regular file on any storage medium.\n\nA: /dev/null is a special kind of file called \"device file\". \nDevice files act as a interface to some kernel functions. They just occupy the space that is needed for a directory entry (\"inode\") but don't have any real content and don't have an actual file size.\nOther device files are e.g. /dev/sda (generally a HDD or SSD), /dev/zero (a file that generates zero's when read), or /dev/random (a file that generates random data when read).

I made 4 partitions.\n1st - for installing ubuntu, \n2nd - for swap, \n3rd - for /Home, \n4th - as free space for installing windows. \nNow, after installing windows 8.1, I am not getting any option to boot ubuntu. Windows automatically boots on starting the computer.\nHow do I resolve this issue. Thanks in advance.\n\nA: I always install Windows first, then Ubuntu. \n\nA: This is a common issue after installing Windows, it installs its own boot loader which is not Linux friendly. Provided Windows hasn't overwritten your Ubuntu install (which it can do, depending on how you installed) then you can boot from the 'boot repair disk' and select 'automatic repair'. Have a google for boot repair disk. It is also worth noting that in order to dual boot into Windows and Ubuntu you have to disable secure boot in the BIOS (EUFI) and you have to turn off fast startup within Windows. \n\nA: You can also try booting from Ubuntu live image and run boot-repair.\nchoose the recommended repair and the grub menu will appear after you reboot.\n", "Q: Can connect to only some networks after update 14.10 I'm using Lubuntu 14.10 on my Macbook 3,1. I'm using the only available Airport driver bcmwl-kernel-source and it is working fine. I can connect to most networks, but not to all. Strangely enough I can wirelessly connect to my personally managed routers I installed at home, but not to those that are installed by others, like the router installed by my ISP at home or the routers at my uni.\nSo I would love to connect to all networks, but I can't seem to pinpoint the problem. I can connect to all those networks fine with my android smartphone, so for now I'm just USB tethering the connection, but it would be much better if I could connect directly.\nI had troubles with wifi before as asked here and at that time the answer worked fine. I could connect to any wifi network, but after updating to 14.10, I tried this again and the only thing it did was remove my wifi functionality.\nDoes anybody know what the problem might be in 14.10 and how I can connect to all wifi networks?\n\nA: Do:\nsudo apt-get purge bcmwl-kernel-source\nsudo apt-get install firmware-b43-installer\n\nReboot\n", "Q: USB mouse on Ubuntu stops working Many times my mouse USB suddenly stops working, though the trackpad works just fine. I have to click it to make it work again. I have found the following solution:\nsudo bash\nfor i in /sys/bus/usb/devices/*/power/control; do echo on > $i; done\n\nHowever, I have to execute this script every time the problem occurs. What is the true reason behind it? How can I fix it permanently?\nI am using Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.\n\nA: This happens because the power management switches off usb devices in order to save power after a certain period of inactivity. Although there are solutions to solve this manually I recommend to install software called tlp.\nsudo apt-get install tlp\nThis software offers options to control power management in a  safe way without having to set things manually in relevant files, like what you've found to be a solution. It works equally good at both laptops and desktops.\nMore info about tlp can be found at several sites like for example this one: http://linuxg.net/how-to-install-tlp-0-6-on-ubuntu-14-10-ubuntu-14-04-ubuntu-12-04-and-derivative-systems/\n", "Q: sed to execute a command as replacement with substitution pattern as argument I am trying to replace time in a log file by:\ncat mlog.log | sed -e \"s/^[0-9\\.]*/\\$(date -d @&)/\"\n\nWhy it always first execute $(date -d $&) but not doing replacement at first and then execute command? \nI thought it would be like:\ndate -d @121223232\n\nLog look like this:\n1428688532.169   peerdiff 2\n1428688534.269   peerdiff 1 \n\n\nA: If mlog.log is space separated:\ncat mlog.log |perl -a  -ne  'chomp($F[0]=`date -d \\@$F[0] +%FT%T`); print join(\" \",@F).\"\\n\"'\n\nIf mlog.log is tab separated:\ncat mlog.log |perl -a -F\"\\t\" -ne  'chomp($F[0]=`date -d \\@$F[0] +%FT%T`); print join(\"\\t\",@F).\"\\n\"'\n\n\nA: The reason why it works like this is how the shell works. First it starts to interpret everything what it can. I.e. it interprets what is in \" quotes. It does not interpret what is in ' quotes. Try to compare echo \"$(date)\" with echo '$(date)'. If you want to do what you want you must use another approach, for instance use :\nawk '{ system(\"echo `date -d @\"$1\"` \"$2\" \"$3);}' < mlog.log\n\nI.e. make awk split the file into columns and execute system command that you feed with columns as needed. You can not use sed the same way because sed s command has no capability to call the shell command.\n\nA: GNU sed has the \"e\" command which:\n\npipe input from a shell command into pattern space\n\nFor your log:\ncat mlog.log | sed -r 's/^([0-9\\.]+)/echo `date -d @\\1`/e'\n2015-04-10T19:55:32+02:00 peerdiff 2\n2015-04-10T19:55:34+02:00 peerdiff 1\n\n", "Q: Why is Gedit set as default calendar app in Ubuntu? Just wondering why is a text editor (Gvim or Gedit) set as the default calendar app in Ubuntu.\nDoes any one know the reason why? \n\n\nA: When there is no real calendar application on your system, it automatically switches to gedit.Because gedit can be configured to have some basic functionality of calendar with extra plugins.\nAnd look here.

To install keytouch, you can either install the deb package for keytouch (with sudo dpkg -i PACKAGE.deb, where PACKAGE.deb is the filename of the package) or compile it from source then install it.\nSource and Debian packages can be found at http://keytouch.sourceforge.net/dl-keytouch.php.

I had never noticed this in earlier releases of the OS.\nEssentially what happens is I get temporarily stuck in the workspace switcher screen (what shows after clicking the \"Workspace Switcher\" icon) displaying the 4 different workspaces. Normally you would just click one of the workspaces then ubuntu zooms back in on that workspace for you, \nhowever clicking the workspaces seems to do nothing when I am hung up.  \nThis seems to happen only some of the time when I am using the workspace switcher to move an open window, say a nautilus file manager window to another workspace.\nI have found that frantically pressing esc and/or the windows button at least 10 or 20 times eventually takes me back to a single workspace view. Also that if that mouse is moved every time I press the windows button the window I was moving in between the ws borders will be updated in position on the screen otherwise it will not move on the ws switcher screen.\nHow can I prevent this from happening?\n\nA: Alt+Enter does the trick hope it helps you \n\nA: Exact same problem happens with 16.04 LTS.  Moving active windows inn the Workspace Switcher very often causes the GUI to hang, with Unity grayed-out.  The windows can still be seen to be updating (and my cron jobs use espeak to talk to me) so I know the underlying system is still running.\nHere is one clue as to why:  It seems to happen most often when the window between workspaces is being updated a lot, such as a FileZilla window during a transfer, or even the System Monitor.  \nTo recover, just press Alt-F1 \nThis causes it to jump immediately to one of the four workspaces.  Seems to pick the workspace that contains the upper-left corner of the application that was being dragged.\nAfterwards, everything works normally again.\n\n\n*\n\n*Tested successfully in Ubuntu 16.04 LTS on two systems with this issue.\n\n\nA: I was having this problem. Seemed to have found a workaround by:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install unity-tweak-tool\n\n*workspace settings -> restore defaults\n\n\nNote that turning the workspace switcher off and setting the number of workspaces to 1 did not work. Windows would get moved off screen and become inaccessible. Thankfully the \"restore defaults\" seems to work.\n\nA: not sure if this is a complete answer as to the behaviour, but what worked for me was to have a key bound to workspace switching using Ubuntu Tweakor compiz. When I get stuck and cant use the mouse to get out, I simply use the hotkey to get out. \nThis seems like a better workaround than having to reset all the parameters every time (besides, Im not sure how you could try and reset something if you are stuck in the preview mode) \n\nA: Giving my thoughts here, I was facing this issue today (only one of my 2 monitors really switched workspaces). Using GNOME Tweaks, under \"Workspaces\", I just needed to select the \"Workspaces span displays' and all worked up fine\n", "Q: Ubuntu inside/alongside windows 7 not taking my deleted partition(After selecting install ubuntu inside windows, my system restarts back) My computer model is \nDell studio 1555, with 4GB Ram and Intel core 2 DUO processor(500 GB HDD).\nPreviously(probably 2012/13), the system was successfully installing any versions properly alongside WINDOWS 7. Unfortunately, I lost those DVDs. Now I have downloaded Ubuntu(12.04.2, 12.04.5[both/32 and 64 bit], 14.10[64 bit]) neither of them, getting installed(I deleted a drive of 80 GB approx. like I previously used to install Ubuntu). Instead, whenever I try to install, it goes well up to the page where \"Install inside windows 7...\" appears. After that I click to continue installing. But surprisingly, DVD gets ejected. \nAnd more surprisingly, earlier when I installed it, i got an option -\n\"Install Alongside Windows 7\"\nBut now a days, it says - \n\"Install Inside Windows 7\"\nNow a days, i am using External DVD drive(Installs Windows 7 properly).\nAnd I tried to install thorough WUBI command prompt too. But some error messages generated. Dear friends, please help me to tackle this.\n\nA: You need to install Windows prior to installing Ubuntu.  Windows uses MBR (Master Boot Record), and Linux uses Grub as the OS loader.  Linux is flexible, and will install with Windows alongside it, but if you try to install Windows after having installed Ubuntu, you're out of luck.  Well, not entirely, but there's a lot of mucking around to do.\nJust make sure you have enough space.  I wouldn't recommend installing Windows 7 on any partition less than 100GB, from my experience.  Because, you want to allow for updates, and whatever software you use, such as games and other stuff.  I've installed Win7 on 80GB partitions, and after installing a couple of games, I started running out of space.  You don't want to get too close to your partition's end, because that's when you start to experience lag on your OS.  Although Win7 does a better job than FAT32 at keeping your filesystem neat and defragged, you'll still run into trouble when trying to find swap space.  So do yourself a favor ... Take any backups that you can, and start over.  If you can afford to, get another hard drive.\nOnce you've backed up, boot from your Windows DVD.  Format the hard drive, and create one partition for Windows, and the rest of the drive, leave it blank.  This way, when you decide to install Ubuntu, it too can create it's own partition.  I'd recommend at least 80GB for Ubuntu ... but take that figure with a grain of salt.  I use a bunch of stuff, so I need the space.  Realistically, you can run Ubuntu with 8GB and be OK, but that's keeping all your other software elsewhere.  Perhaps a NAS or Samba share.  \nIf you need further detail on how to do this, follow this link.\nBest of luck!  Just remember, the figures I gave above are to be taken with caution.  If you know you don't need that much, then go ahead and by all means make them smaller.  If you need to keep those larger, feel free to make them larger, as I don't know how you'll use your's.  I like to estimate and allow for expansion, but if you know how much space your final set-up will take up, then use your discretion.\n", "Q: How to start Unity desktop on a headless machine?

Wireless devices both internal and external, simply wear out.  \nI don't know if there is a particularly popular chip which is prone to failing or if the problem is caused by overheating.  In any case, there is a simply short-term fix, and that is to buy an external usb wifi adapter which is known to work with Ubuntu.  Most such devices cost under $20, and to make your quest simpler, I'm linking you to the very model I carry every day in my fanny pack for emergency purposes.  It has been used in numerous repairs of ubuntu installations in which the internal wifi wasn't initially supported and it was only possible to connect the computer to the internet using this already supported device.\nLater if you want your usb port back, you can have the internal wifi adapter replaced.  HPs are picky, so you have to get the exact one supported by your bios.  Don't hold me responsible if this replacement internal HP wifi adapter isn't supported by your bios, but it would probably work, and at $8, the price is right.\n", "Q: GPU overheating 133 celsius Recently had to reinstall Ubuntu 14.04.

The error message you report indicates that you booted the Windows installer in EFI mode. To install to your disk, you must boot the installation disc in BIOS mode. Your firmware is almost certainly already configured to support this (see below), but you happened to follow an EFI path when booting the Windows installer. Try again by using the computer's built-in boot manager (typically accessed by hitting a function key early in the boot process). This time, though, carefully read the options. There will probably be two options for the optical drive or USB flash drive you're using. One option will include the string \"UEFI\" and the other won't. Select the option that lacks this string and you should boot in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode.\nIf you don't see a BIOS-mode boot option, it's possible that your boot medium lacks that support. A few USB flash drives seem to be unbootable in BIOS mode on some computers, in my experience, even when they've got the right data; this seems to be something electrical about the device. Thus, you might need to try another USB flash drive. It's also possible for a USB flash drive or optical disc to be missing the necessary files or data structures, in which case you may need to prepare the disc in some other way. I don't know what that way might be for a Windows installation medium. You may need to ask on a Windows forum if you think this is the problem.\nIncidentally, you are almost certainly already booting Ubuntu in BIOS mode. I say this because, when Ubuntu installs in EFI mode, it uses GPT by default, but your fdisk output and screen shot both show an MBR partition table. Furthermore, it's an MBR partition table that lacks an EFI System Partition (ESP), which is where EFI boot loaders are stored.\nIf you can't seem to get the Windows installer to boot in anything but EFI mode, you can convert your Ubuntu installation to boot in EFI mode, too. This process is not risk-free, so you should back up before proceeding. To try:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the USB flash drive or CD-R image of rEFInd. Prepare a boot medium and test that it works. (You should be able to boot your existing Ubuntu installation with it.)\n\n*In Ubuntu, launch gdisk on your hard disk (as in sudo gdisk /dev/sda).\n\n*In gdisk, type v to verify the disk. If gdisk reports any errors, abort by typing q and fix the problem.\n\n*If there are no problems, type w to save your changes (the conversion from MBR to GPT that gdisk does automatically).\n\n*Reboot into an Ubuntu live CD.\n\n*Use GParted to resize a partition so that you've got ~550MiB of free space. This free space can be anywhere, but it's best near the start of the disk.\n\n*In the free space, create an ESP. This should be a FAT32 partition with its \"boot flag\" set.\n\n*Install Windows.\n\n*Using the rEFInd CD or USB drive, test that you can boot both Windows and Ubuntu.\n\n*Using rEFInd, boot to Ubuntu.\n\n*Install a Linux boot loader. Two relatively easy options are:\n\n*\n\n*Install the rEFInd Debian package or PPA.\n\n*Run Boot Repair to replace the BIOS-mode GRUB you've got now with an EFI-mode GRUB.\n\n\n*Reboot and hope it all works.\n\n\nA: Reboot your PC and go to the bios, find the option legacy BIOS-compatibility or something like that, (If you add what manufacture and version to the question, I can add more detail here), turn it on, reboot to Widows installer, reformat the NTFS partition (NTFS again) and it should install.\nPlease note : This is instructions for installing Windows 8 to a MBR partition table and not Windows 10. Windows 10 is unreleased for general use and as such is subject to changes, therefor Windows 10 may behave badly or differently.\n", "Q: How do I fix a DNS leak? Now that I'm using a VPN 24/7, I've been looking to enhance my privacy further and discovered the phenomenon called \"VPN leaks\"... Further investigation has revealed that my computer does in fact, leak the DNS.\nBut the question is, how do I fix it?\nI found this article about DNS leaks and Ubuntu.\nWhich indicates that I can fix DNS leaks by entering:\necho \"#disable ipv6″ | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf\necho \"net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6 = 1″ | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf\necho \"net.ipv6.conf.default.disable_ipv6 = 1″ | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf\necho \"net.ipv6.conf.lo.disable_ipv6 = 1″ | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf\n\nBut this is a pretty old article - will this still apply to Ubuntu 14.04 LTS or newer?

You're probably using an integrated video card without dedicated memory, which is taking up some of the RAM space (1GB) to operate. From Wikipedia.com:\n\nA side effect of this is that when some RAM is allocated for graphics, it becomes effectively unavailable for anything else, so an example computer with 512 MiB RAM set up with 64MiB graphics RAM will appear to the operating system and user to only have 448 MiB RAM installed.\n\nThe only way to solve this, unfortunately, is to switch to a new video card with dedicated memory.\n", "Q: Unable to get to the home screen or login Initially I started to upgrade my ubuntu from 12.04 to 14.04. \nI failed for some reason.\nError: filesystem check or mount failed\n\nCommands I ran:\nmount -o remount,rw /\ndpkg --configure -a\n\nThen I forced a restart by pressing the power button.\nNow I am unable to login with my correct password and Guest Session is also not able to work, it was without a password.\nUrgent help required.\n\nA: What kind of Display Manager do you use? Have you tried to reconfigure it? you can do so by using the command: sudo dpkg-reconfigure gdm or sudo dpkg-reconfigure lightdm for the one you are using.\nMaybe hitting Alt+Ctrl+F1 to change to console mode and using the commands:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo dpkg --configure -a\nsudo apt-get install -f\nsudo apt-get upgrade\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade\nsudo apt-get autoremove\n\nAfter that, maybe sudo service lightdm restart or sudo service gdm restart could get you back to what you are looking for. \n", "Q: Ubuntu Wifi not working I am trying to learn using ubuntu.

I have a bug where permissions on /dev/input/event* are wrong, so when I use Mumble, the application can't detect key presses. If I run the following command it \"fixes\" the issue, but I'd like a permanent fix. \nsudo chmod a+r /dev/input/event/*\n\nWhat determines the permissions on /dev/input/event* and how do I permanently set them?\n\nA: A more flexible way to manage permission on files is to use ACL.\nsudo setfacl -m u:popey:rw /dev/input/eventx\n\nIf you really need to make this permanent then you can use an udev rules that set it for your event input device\nadd a file /etc/udev/rules.d/99-userdev-input.rules with:\nKERNEL==\"event*\", SUBSYSTEM==\"input\", RUN+=\"/usr/bin/setfacl -m u:popey:rw $env{DEVNAME}\"\n\nyou can check the ACLs permission with\ngetfacl /dev/input/event*\n\n\nA: I don't know what initially sets the permissions of the character devices /dev/input/event*\nbut, I do know you can change those permissions with a software which is on your system by default as part of coreutils. see the command man mknod.\nThe permissions of my event devices are:\n\ncrw-rw---- 1 root input 13, 64 Apr 14 06:39 /dev/input/event0\n\nhere are some usage examples:\n~$ sudo mknod lolwat c 4 64 \n~$ sudo mknod lolwatnow c 4 64  -m 777\n~$ ls -l lolwat*\ncrw-r--r-- 1 root root 4, 64 Apr 14 08:07 lolwat\ncrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 4, 64 Apr 14 08:08 lolwatnow\n\nif you need more info about for deciding on major and minor numbers, look here\nNow, you say the permissions are wrong. So something must be setting them wrong, and that thing, must run as root. mknod could be used to create an device, but mkdev could also. you may want to look at the permissions of whatever the default actions are for mkdev, and mknod. \nAs in my examples: /dev/input/event0 has crw-rw permissions, but the default permissions, of lolwat were set to crw-r--r--\nI have some uncertainty, whether type of device dictates original permissions.You can experiment with this to find out. \nHere is another link for more info about mknod\n\nA: Basically, you'd need to add a file in /etc/udev/rules.d/ (you could name it something like 75-input-events.conf)\nAnd add lines KERNEL==\"eventX\" , SUBSYSTEM==\"input\", MODE=\"0777\" for each event into that file, where x is the number. For instance, I have events 0 through 9, so I personally would do for each one of them. Last answer on this thread suggest you could have added KERNEL==event* (i.e., with wild card),too.\n\nA: In a terminal run:\n\nsudo nano -b /etc/rc.local\n\nGo down to the line that says \"exit 0\" and in a line above it type:\n\nsudo chmod a+r /dev/input/event\n\nHit Ctrl+x to exit that.

I wanted to check if they use the same frequencies and found out that I can check the current AFH-map with hcitool afh.\nThe result looks something like\nuser@device:~$ hcitool afh xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx\nAFH map: 0xff4f28000000f0fe0000\n\nSo now, what does that mean, where is that documented?\n\nA: I just came across this question looking for the meaning of \"AFH map\". Although the question is quite old, I'd like to share my findings.\nThere are (at least) two different mechanisms that help to reduce the interference between Bluetooth and WiFi:\n1. Adaptive Frequency Hopping (AFH)\nBluetooth devices transmit on 79 different channels, spaced 1 MHz apart between 2,402 MHz and 2,480 MHz. During data transfer, the sender changes the used channel very quickly in a pseudo-random order (\"hopping sequence\") to reduce the chance of interference caused by other radio services using the same frequency range. The receiver knows the sequence and \"hops\" the channels synchronously with the sender.\nThe basic principle of AFH is simple: Channels with known interference are simply left out of the hopping sequence. The AFH map simply tells both communication devices which of the 79 channels are good to use and which to leave out. The AFH map consists of 80 bits (20 hex digits) corresponding to the 79 channels (and 1 reserved bit).\nChannels usable for Bluetooth have the corresponding bit in the AFH map set. That is, the more \"1\" bits you see, the less interference is there and consequently the more throughput your Bluetooth link will have.\nAFH was introduced with Bluetooth 1.2. You can find more details e.g. in the  Bluetooth 5.0 Core Specification (search for \"AFH channel map\" in the PDF file).\n2. Bluetooth Coexistence\nWhile AFH covers any (probably external) source of interference, BT coexistence is designed to minimize interference caused by a Bluetooth interface and a WiFi interface that are co-located in the same device (i.e. laptop, smartphone). Basically there is a wire running from the WiFi chip to the Bluetooth chip. Whenever the WiFi chip is transmitting a frame, it tells the Bluetooth chip to \"shut up for a moment\" until the WiFi transmission is over.\nOver time, different, more elaborate variants of this basic scheme were developed (2-wire, 3-wire, unidirectional, bi-directional etc.)\n", "Q: Can I make a read only image read write?

The Story\nI installed wine some time ago, and after trying out some versions of Cinema 4D that were \"free\", I looked in the comments of the videos, and saw some people complaining about viruses. I got worried, downloaded and installed MalwareBytes, and scanned my \"system\". Of course, since MalwareBytes was runnning through Wine, it only scanned ~/.wine/C:. It found many viruses/trojans and I opted to delete them. I did so.\nQuestions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Assuming there is any malware left, can this malware spread into my OS? Tell me the entire truth on what can happen.\n\n*I deleted my entire .wine directory and am planning to uninstall wine later.

Please be specific on what I should do because I want to be 100% sure that there are no viruses.\nI am sure that many others have these questions too, so please answer this question to the point. \nAdditional information:\nWine was installed with sudo-apt get. The exact commands can be found here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cQW70dsVsM\nCommands:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-wine/ppa -y\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install wine1.6 -y\n\nI did try to install a font that was a ttf font. I tried to convert it to otf with no success. Then, I placed it in the fonts directory directly. I then saw that some people said it was malicious, and I removed it.\nThis question was flagged as  a duplicate of this question: Risks/Disadvantages associated with Wine\nIt is not the same. This question is more precise, as it specifies two scenarios involving viruses, not risks of viruses. The other question talked about Internet Explorer; this one does not mention the installation of any programs.\nNote: wine was installed with sudo privileges, so does that mean it runs with sudo privileges?\n\nA: No, Windows malware can't \"spread\" to the host Linux system.\nNo, Windows malware doesn't \"spread\" across Wine prefixes.\nFor both questions, a theoretical possibility is not to be ruled out, but it would mean that the malware writers would deliberately attempt to target Wine systems, which is extremely unlikely - unless you are a security researcher you don't care about this.\nBy nuking your .wine you should be okay.\nNota bene: Windows malware in Wine can do all sorts of bad things to files it has permissions to access, which includes your home directory.\nWindows malware can't spread to the Linux host, but it can nuke files in your Linux home directory.\nEDIT: Of course, the likelihood of having false positives if you scan an entire Wine installation with a Windows antimalware tool is probably greater than everything else.\n", "Q: Error with tor in ubuntu14.04 I get obfs2 and obfs3 from tor.

To boot Ubuntu from disk-on-key Despite the abundance of dual-boot issues lying in the World Wide Web, I decided to create the new topic with my specific question.\nI have a laptop Asus K55V + UEFI + 500Gb HDD + Windows 8 upgraded to 8.1. The disk is divided on several partitions, according to GPT disks requirements, user’s partitions are C (Windows 8.1) and D (Data). I really want to shrink the drive D for adding new Linux partition, let's call it E, and do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Because of my BIOS is UEFI, is it possible to install Ubuntu on the partition E without using GRUB at all? May the UEFI prompt to load Windows (from C) or Linux (from E)? Is it possible? \n\n*if #1 is not possible, I would like to have the following boot option: to install additional bootloader (GRUB2?) on some flash disk-on-key, it will be knowing about one OS only – Linux. Then, when necessary, it will be possible to boot Linux by simply inserting this disk-on-key to a USB slot.\n\n\nBy this way, I will not modify the preinstalled Windows with its EFI bootloader, and, at the same time, will have possibility to work with Linux. I think this is very optimal procedure, isn’t it? My question is what are concrete steps to achieve my goal?\n\nA: First, you say your \"BIOS is UEFI,\" but that's not true. You almost certainly have no BIOS; you have a UEFI. This may sound like splitting hairs, but it's not; referring to an EFI/UEFI as a \"BIOS\" drags in a lot of assumptions that simply do not apply in the EFI world. (\"UEFI\" is essentially version 2.x of EFI, so I generally use \"EFI,\" as it's the more general term.) Generally speaking, EFI is a replacement for BIOS, not an extension to it. There are some exceptions and caveats, though:\n\n\n*\n\n*Some very early EFIs were built atop a conventional BIOS. One example I've seen is Gigabyte's Hybrid EFI. Such systems do have a BIOS, and it's used both to boot BIOS-mode OSes and to initialize the hardware for the benefit of the EFI.\n\n*Most modern EFIs for x86-64 systems include a Compatibility Support Module (CSM), which enables the EFI to use boot loaders written for BIOS. The CSM is to the EFI as WINE or dosemu is to Linux; but just as WINE does not turn Linux into Windows, the CSM does not make the EFI a BIOS.\n\n\nSorry if this seems long-winded and pedantic, but it deserves emphasis because I see a lot of people heading into EFI-land with BIOS assumptions that lead them into trouble. This is evident in your own question....\nOn an EFI-based computer, installing a second OS does not normally overwrite the boot loader of the first OS. Of course, you must make room for the second OS's partitions, but that's independent of the boot loader. Under EFI, boot loaders are stored as separate files on the EFI System Partition (ESP), which is a FAT partition with a type code of C12A7328-F81F-11D2-BA4B-00A0C93EC93B (EF00 in gdisk, the \"boot flag\" set in parted or GParted, \"EFI System Partition\" or \"EFI boot partition\" in the Ubuntu installer).\nEFI determines which boot loader to use by entries stored in NVRAM. When you install Ubuntu, it will create its own boot loader (GRUB) on the ESP (stored in EFI/ubuntu), add that new boot loader to the computer's NVRAM-based list, and then set the Ubuntu entry to be the default. Ubuntu will not change the Windows boot loader, but that Windows boot loader will run only if you enter the computer's own boot manager and select it or if you chainload it from GRUB. Once you install Ubuntu, you can tweak these settings with the efibootmgr utility; for instance, you could set the Windows boot loader to be the default and then use the machine's built-in boot manager to select GRUB. To do this, you must first identify the existing entries by typing sudo efibootmgr and then set the boot order you desire (so that Windows is first) with the -o option, as in sudo efibootmgr -o 2,5 to make Boot0002 first and Boot0005 second.\nNote that a Linux-capable boot loader is required to boot Linux. It doesn't have to be GRUB, but something is needed. Thus, your option #1 will work only if you install something manually. There are several EFI boot loaders for Linux available -- see my page on this subject for details. You could in principle install one of these on a USB flash drive, leaving the ESP and NVRAM untouched. I don't know what the point of that would be if you've got a regular disk-based installation of Ubuntu, though; it would be like trying to keep music out of an opera house by banning iPods within its walls.\nIf you want to keep GRUB from installing in Ubuntu, the trick is this:\n\n\n*\n\n*When you launch the Ubuntu installer, select the option to try Ubuntu before installing it, rather than the option to install it.\n\n*When the desktop appears, open a Terminal window by clicking on the Ubuntu icon in the upper-left corner, typing terminal in the search field, and hitting enter or clicking the Terminal icon.\n\n*In the Terminal window, type ubiquity -b. This launches the installer program (Ubiquity) with an option (-b) to not install a boot loader.\n\n\nOnce the install is finished, it will be up to you to install a boot loader yourself, whether it be to the ESP or to a USB flash drive. Again, see my EFI boot loaders page (referenced earlier) for information on what's available and basic installation instructions.\n\nA: Option 1 is most probably possible, depending on your BIOS's implementation of UEFI. \nGRUB can (and should, if your install disk was booted in UEFI mode or you installed the UEFI bootloader afterwards) install itself onto your EFI partition, and will not overwrite the Windows boot loader. You can then choose to boot (using your UEFI BIOS's boot menu) with the Windows boot loader or GRUB.\nThat should work out of the box, provided your UEFI BIOS isn't hardcoded to boot from /EFI/Boot/bootx64.efi on your EFI partition, and that the GRUB UEFI bootloader is installed.\n", "Q: How do I fix dependency and tar problems with linux-image-extra* package?

I don't know well Linux Mint, but Cinnamon seems to preserve this feature.\nBesides this, I chosen one right answer as it seems to do the job, and is something a Linux novice would be able to handle. \n\nA: From the console I use: \nsetxkbmap -option esperanto:qwerty \n\n\nA: La ebleco facile elekti 'Adding Esperanto circumflexes (supersigno)' malaperis en Ubuntu 14.04.\nEkde Ubuntu 14 vi\n1) instalu 'gnome-tweak-tool' kaj \n2) elektu 'Typing' (tajpado, la 2a vico plej supre) kaj\n3) ŝanĝu 'Adding Esperanto Supersigned Letters' al 'To the corresponding key in a QUERTY layoyt' \nPlease see also other good solutions here: https://esperanto.stackexchange.com/questions/378/how-do-i-type-the-letters-with-accents-on-linux/440\n\nA: I'm running Trusty, and found the place to set the Compose key right where David suggested: in Settings/\"Text Entry\"/\"Keyboard Settings....\"/\"Text Entry\"/Shortcuts/Typing (where the selections are a confusing mix of menu selections, tabs, highlighted text, selections from a list, etc).

You should be able to access the encrypted home directory rather easily:\n\n\n*\n\n*Get a Ubuntu live CD/USB, preferably of a recent version, and boot into it\n\n*Mount your root partition (either your /home partition if you have one, or the root partition otherwise)\n\n*Run ecryptfs-recover-private /media/ubuntu/ROOTFSUUID/home/USERNAME where USERNAME is your username, and /media/ubuntu/ROOTFSUUID is the path to your root partition mountpoint. Follow the prompts, and if mounting was successful, the mount point of your encrypted home directory should be printed into the terminal.\n\n*Navigate to the mount point and copy your files out.\n\n\nIf that fails, you might get it to work by chrooting your root partition on your live CD:\n\n\n*\n\n*Mount your root partition: sudo mount /dev/sdXY /mnt/, where /dev/sdXY is your root partition device\n\n*Run for i in /dev /dev/pts /proc /run /sys; do sudo mount -b $i /mnt$i; done\n\n*Mount the media you want to copy your files to to a directory in /mnt (e.g. /mnt/mnt) with sudo mount /dev/sdXY /mnt/mnt/, where /dev/sdXY is the media you wish to copy to, not the root partition\n\n*Run sudo chroot /mnt\n\n*Run ecryptfs-recover-private /home/USERNAME and follow the prompts\n\n*Copy out the files from the mount point outputted by the command in step 5\n\n", "Q: Anthy uses previously selected (wrong) layout Using Ubuntu 14.04.2.\nI have the following input sources in Text Entry: Russian, Japanese (Anthy), English (US).\nWhen switching to \"Japanese (Anthy)\" from \"English (US)\", everything works fine.

Because I heard, when you have a SSD you don't need swap partition. If I creates a swap partition,allocating 2GB space for swap partition is OK?\n\nA: SSDs do not change the situation regarding swap space (at least, not much).

I want to completely disable resetting root password! Is it possible? If yes, then how?\n\nA: If you wish to prevent people with access to your computer from changing your root password, you can encrypt your entire Ubuntu partition so that other people cannot boot your installation of Ubuntu at all without knowing the password to the partition.\nThis is because once somebody has physical access to your computer, there is no way (at least of that I can think of) to prevent that other than to have your root partition encrypted. \n", "Q: How to trace/monitor the I/O of a Linux command I ran find / -name abc.html and a short time after I ran this command again. This time it was very fast, so I know the find must be caching the result somewhere.\nHow can I find out where the cache is stored?\n\nA: Indeed, as @zongfu pointed out, find does not cache its results in a file, but rather the kernel is caching the directories find is reading so they can be read again without touching the disk, which is why it is faster.  If you still want to see what kind of IO a program is doing though, you can use strace.  This program runs another program you specify and logs the system calls the program makes.  Without any arguments it will print them all, which can be a lot of information, so you man want to limit it to only certain calls, such as open() so you can see what files the program is going to open.  This would look like:\nstrace -eopen someprogram\n\n\nA: find does not cache anything, especially onto disk. The reason why the second run is a lot faster is because the Linux caches the accessed data (in this case directory listings) in memory (see free).\n", "Q: Installing MySQL Workbench ⇒ Error I have installed MySQL Workbench in the past using MySQL APT.\nMy software repositories lists have recently been updated and since then my MySQL Workbench disappeared.

Probably that is because sda3 and sda5 are with key image that I think means 'locked'. How to solve problem and copy locked partitions.\n\nA: you can use \"gparted\" which is very easy to use and convenient for such tasks and needs, \n  But you need to know that generally partitions' sizes is increased or reduced from their ends by trimming or appending some of the FREE space after it.

Even VLC says that they're not the best player out there and when comes to problems and they've posted a lot saying that they are trying to make the most compatible player possible. So it's not the best. You can argue.\n1st possibility -\nDuring the same problems as yours. I've changed to DivX player because I discovered DivX uses a different plugin and the video was DivX made and every different player use his own plugins for HEVC and libde265.\n2nd possibility -\nHardware compatibility. Try another computer instead and with recent graphic adapters like NVIDIA or AMD.\n3rd possibility -\nPlay the video on Linux if you're using Windows and vice versa if you're using Linux.\nI'd easily resolved the same problems as yours years ago like green screens, lines on the screen, video playing with lags, and videos not playing at all. All by using those methods above.\nHope it helps!\nEdit: Changing to a recent graphics adapter that may or not resolve your problem same as trying to play HVEC on Android devices.

When my students register themselves on my site, I store user info in an MySQL DB.\nI would like to give my students a website on my Ubuntu installation, when registering on my site, and I would like this to be automated. My question is - Can I somehow use the data direct from the MySQL DB to give them a subdomain (username.mydoamin.com) on my Ubuntu or can i execute shell commands on Ubuntu from PHP, and automate what I am doing manually now?\n\nA: \ncan i execute shell commands on Ubuntu from PHP, and automate what I am doing manually now?\n\nYou can run shell commands from within PHP using the shell_exec() function or using the ` ` (backtick) operator: if you're running PHP < 5.4.0, first make sure to disable safe mode, then in your PHP script you can use either of those syntaxes:\n\n\n*\n\n*$return = shell_exec('<shell_command>');\n\n*$return = `<shell_command>`;\nUnless you want to capture return values from single commands, the most straightforward way to do what you're asking for would be to condensate everything you're doing manually in the shell into a stand-alone bash (or whatever) script to be called once by using either of those methods. For example the syntax for a bash script would be:\n\n\n*\n\n*$return = shell_exec('bash script.sh');\n\n*$return = `bash script.sh`;\nTo pass parameters to the script (e.g. the value of a $username variable):\n\n\n*\n\n*$return = shell_exec(\"bash script.sh '$username'\");\n\n*$return = `bash script.sh '$username'`;\nTo retrieve the passed parameters within the bash script (e.g. the value of a $username variable passed with the method above):\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# ...\nusername=$1\n# ...\n\nOr just simply reference $1 where needed, e.g.:\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# ...\necho \"$1\"\n# ...\n\n\nA: As a follow up on my own question I will elaborate with my experience. I made Shell execution work from PHP, but had major security issues with the solution. That was a MAJOR mistake from my hand that I did not see this at the beginning.\nTo eliminate security risks I made a bash script that looked activated users up in the user table. If the user was active AND not a linux user then the user should be created on my linux, a database user is created, a subdomain is created and ssh is locked for the user. I set up a cron job running every 60 minutes, and upon user creation an email is sent to the user with registration info.\nThat eliminates a lot of security risks (not all).\nBjarke\n", "Q: Can an unmounted USB be infected my malware? Yesterday, I went on a dark creepy site whose js freezed my system/firefox (Ubuntu 14.04 up to date, Firefox 37.0.1 up to date). Now I tried, from the same system, to find any malware with:\nsudo chkrootkit\n\nand\nsudo rkhunter --check\n\nshowing nothing but the default false-positives.\nI know it is recommended to do this from a liveCD or liveUSB making it hard for the malware to hide. I have a liveUSB SystemRescueCD but I am not aware of how to accomplish this. I pretty sure I will need to mount the \"infected-device\" to check it but every tutorial I found just mentioned to do the commands which I have posted above from a LiveUSB. Not how, and I am pretty sure chkrootkit and rkhunter can not check a file system without having it mounted.\nHowever now I am at my maybe infected system with the LiveUSB plugged in but not mounted. (I disabled automount due several reasons)\nCould it be that my LiveUSB is now also infected even when it is not mounted? I know the malware could write to the device even without mounting it but this would totally destroy the filesystem on the USB. Where can I look up a mount-history in case the malware did it unbeknown of me?\nI know, for that he would need my user password but who says that the malware did not log my keyboard when executing an sudo command?\n\nA: To answer the actual question:\nYes, a software can write to a device directly but contrary to your assumption this doesn't destroy a file system since software also can read directly from the file system. If the software does everything right it would just be like reading and writing the usual (indirect) way. Remember that it just had to do what your system does all the time. Plus, the software wouldn't have to care about any privileges managed by the file system.\nHowever – and here comes the good message – to read or write directly requires read/write access to the device files, for example /dev/sdb. This access is only granted to the super user.\nYou can try this yourself by entering\ndd if=/dev/sda bs=32 count=1\n\ninto a terminal. /dev/sda is your first hard drive, replace it with whatever your USB stick is (probably /dev/sdb) if you want to test it for it and not your hard drive.\nYou will get\ndd: failed to open ‘/dev/sda’: Permission denied\n\nas output.\nIf you did this with sudo or as root it would write the fist 32 byte of your hard drive / your USB stick to the console.\nHowever, you should be aware of the fact that normal users can in fact mount devices. So no direct access to the device is necessary and a malicious software can read and write using the normal (indirect) way.\nYou can test this yourself by entering the command\nmount /dev/sdb1 /some/directory/already/in/place\n\nwhere /dev/sdb1 is the first partition of your USB stick.\n", "Q: Shortcuts doesn't work with notify-osd stopped Whenever I stop notify-osd using\npkill -SIGSTOP notify-osd\n\nall shortcuts doesn't work anymore (or at least doesn't work well).\nI mean, sometimes for random periods of time they works well. \nOther times it seems that they doesn't work: I press the mute button and nothing happens. Then, some minutes later, all the shortcuts are invoked one after another and finally the audio is muted.\nThis strange behaviour only occurs when I SIGSTOP the process, while if I'm SIGKILL it all works normally. \nWhy does this happen?\n\nA: When you send the unstoppable SIGSTOP signal, the program is placed in a paused state with the expectation that a SIGCONT signal will be received, I believe what you are seeing is by design.\n\"The only circumstances in which an unstoppable signal may be deferred is if the process is in IO wait, or stuck in kernel space. Then it’s just deferred, and will be dispatched once the process leaves kernel space.\"\nSources:\nhttps://superuser.com/questions/594508/whats-the-difference-between-sigkill-and-sigstop\nhttp://blogofsiva.blogspot.com/2012/06/why-sigkill-and-sigstop-cannot-be.html\nhttp://www.ucs.cam.ac.uk/docs/course-notes/unix-courses/Building/files/signals.pdf\n", "Q: Can't connect with ethernet.

If it is so, you can fix the problem easily by going to /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/ and removing unused keys (e.g. keys for old PPAs that you have since deleted).\nThe bug occurs if there are more than 40 keys (*.gpg) in /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/.\n", "Q: How to change the spacing of formula objects in Libreoffice Writer I'm inserting scientific formulae into a document in Libreoffice Writer within a paragraph using Insert>Object>Formula, and the spacing either side of the formula object is too large for the required formatting.\nFor example after the object any punctuation, like a full stop, is displaced too far from the formula. Can I change the general settings of formula objects so that they all have a user specified spacing?\n\n\nA: In addition to your own answer, in order to affect all formulas in a document, you need to change formula frame style. This can be done this way (refer to the image below):\n\n*\n\n*Navigate to Styles menu (or F11 and proceed to step 3)\n\n*Select Manage Styles from there\n\n*In the appeared right panel select Frame Styles from the top row\n\n*Right-click Formula entry from there\n\n*From the drop-down menu select Modify...\n\n*In the appeared window navigate to Wrap tab\n\n*Modify spacing as you wish in the corresponding section\n\n*Don't forget to apply\n\n\n\nA: I found the wrapping options and have solved the issue for specific formula objects.\nFor those experiencing the same issue:\n\n\n*\n\n*Right click on the object (in my case a formula).\n\n*From the options that appear in the drop down menu select \"Object\" (you can also press the \"o\" key as a shortcut). This will bring up a new widow showing that object's specific properties.\n\n*From the available tabs in this window click on \"Wrap\".\n\n*You should see a window like the one shown below; under the \"Spacing\" heading check to see what the spacing distance is for \"Left\" and \"Right\".\n\n\n\n*Set the values in \"Left\" and \"Right\" to zero (or any other setting you may need). Then click \"OK\".\n\n\nNote: This will only effect the settings for that particular object, not all objects in you file.\n", "Q: Error in installing NS2 \nHere is the Error i am getting while installing NS2 in version 2.35 in ubuntu 14.04. \nWhat is the solution of the error ? \nDo I need to re-install the whole setup or specific module because this error happen after some time. \nI have tried 2 time and both time got same error. \n\nA: Open the file in ns-2.35/linkstate/ls.h and in the line 137 replace the :\nvoid eraseAll() { erase(baseMap::begin(), baseMap::end()); }\n\nwhith :\nvoid eraseAll() { baseMap::erase(baseMap::begin(), baseMap::end()); }\n\n\nA: Try this \n$ sudo apt-get install ns2  nam xgraph\nAlso this reference can be used to install ns2 \nhttps://getch.wordpress.com/tag/sudo-apt-get-install-ns-nam-xgraph/\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.10 MAAS - Importing images Hello I've tried to run the command to import images to ubuntu maas however I get an error and the web config page doesn't seem to import them either.\nThe server does have a network connection as I was able to run the apt-get update command.\n~$ maas-import-pxe-files\nusage: maas-import-pxe-files [-h] --sources-file SOURCES_FILE\nmaas-import-pxe-files: error: argument --sources-file is required\n\nA: In 14.10 MAAS now handles the importing of boot images.

Until 13.10 and the grub2 version used there (version number is 2.02~beta2-... since years/multiple Ubuntu releases) parallel Ubuntu installations on other partitions (both with and without separate boot partitions, both with EFI and legacy BIOS) where recognized and available for multiboot. This is no longer the case. What is the criteria to make update-grub/grub-probe -t device /boot/grub recognize partitions again?\nMy current setup is having an EFI System Partition (ESF) with boot and esf flag set and different /boot/ partitions (ext4) and different OS/root partitions (ext4 and btrfs with Linux different derivates (Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora) installed).\n\nA: In parted and GParted, an ESP is identified by a \"boot flag,\" but there's no such thing as an \"esf flag\" in either program. Thus, it's unclear to me what you mean by that. Please check it and report the actual \"flags\" set. It's unlikely that this detail is directly related to your problem, but it might be.\nAFAIK, current versions of GRUB should recognize older Ubuntu installations. If yours is not doing so, you should consider filing a bug report. A post here does not qualify, since it will be sheer chance if the right Ubuntu developer sees a post here.\nOne possible legitimate reason that auto-detection might not be working is that your older installations might be missing or damaged. You should post a link to the RESULTS.txt file generated by Boot Info Script (installable as boot-info-script in Ubuntu) so that others can examine your configuration for evidence that this is or is not the case.\nTwo alternatives occur to me if you're having problems with auto-detection of OSes that are actually present:\n\n\n*\n\n*You can manually edit your GRUB configuration file. You'll need to know enough about your other installations to identify them to GRUB.\n\n*You can use another EFI boot loader for Linux. Most of these will require manual configuration, but my rEFInd may be able to pick up your other installations with little or no configuration.\n\n", "Q: Keyboard starts as English even being configured for Spanish Upon Ubuntu's installation I configured the keyboard to be Spanish.  I think it worked fine for a while but after sometime, and maybe some updates, every time I start Ubuntu it is set to English even though it shows as Spanish at the task-bar.  Once I click on the already ES-Spanish option, it works as it should be.\ncat /etc/default/keyboard \n\nXKBMODEL=\"pc105\"\nXKBLAYOUT=\"es\"\nXKBVARIANT=\"\"\nXKBOPTIONS=\"\"\n\nPlease let me know what could I check.\n\nA: You could try checking the Keyboard Layout Chart to make sure that the key configuration matches up with your physical keyboard. Or, if your physical keyboard isn't a spanish keyboard, you can change the settings to English (International) which will still allow you to type accented characters.\n", "Q: Duo boot win7 and Ubuntu error When I boot up I can access windows 7 easily and it works fine at the moment but when I select to boot Ubuntu this error appears http://imgur.com/cdx5w2p when I press esc Ubuntu boots but that error is a bit weird isn't it? There's obviously an error, can someone explain why it's happening and how to fix it? I used EasyBCD to create the boot menu thing \n\nA: I'm running Windows 8.1 and Ubuntu 14.10, but I got the same error message when I was trying to install Ubuntu. The error occurs because your computer has Windows set as the default OS, so every time you boot your computer it tries to go into Windows no matter what.\nIt might be a little different for you, but I had to turn off fast boot, make Windows no longer my default OS, and then change the boot order. The first change was somewhere in the control panel, in the System Settings I believe. The latter two changes had to be done from the BIOS menu (which I access by pushing the DEL key when my computer starts up, but apparently this is different for all computers. As an alternative, you can hold down the SHIFT key when you click Restart and there you should find some option to change the UEFI preferences or boot into BIOS.)\n", "Q: How can I move the cursor between displays in Ubuntu 14? I have 2 displays connected. What should I do to move the cursor between displays?\n\nA: Displays have an arrangement. You can view and change it by launcher \"Displays\" from the dash. By moving your cursor over the edge of an display the other display is on you move it between the displays.\nTo be better able to do this, disable \"Sticky edges\" right in the display settings which you already opened.\n", "Q: Wifi broadcom BCM4352 not recognized after fresh install I've run a live USB session on Ubuntu 14.10 before installing it. In software & Updates -> Additional Drivers I could directly select a Broadcom proprietary driver. After a click on Apply Changes, the wifi went on.\nNow I've installed Ubuntu for real (updating the packages during the installation process), I can still see the Broadcom driver displayed, but selecting it fails.\nI've seen in other threads that people tried some complex solutions that eventually worked (BCM4352 Wireless network card issues with lubuntu 14.04 LTS).\nBefore trying this, do you have any idea why something would work on a live session and not a installed system ? I really wish there was a simple solution to my problem (I'm quite new with Linux). Thanks !\n\nA: *\n\n*After you install Ubuntu to your hard drive, you can extract bcmwl-kernel-source and its dependency dkms from the install DVD or USB.\n\n*Navigate to /pool/restricted/b/bcmwl and drag and drop the deb file to your desktop.\n\n*Next, navigate to /pool/main/d/dkms drag and drop dkms to your desktop.\n\n*Now install both with:\nsudo dpkg -i ~/Desktop/*.deb\n\n\n*Load the driver:\nsudo modprobe wl\n\nYour wireless should now be working.\n\nA: I found a way to enable the wifi on my dell xps 15 (2015) on Ubuntu 14.10.\nHere is my personal complete process:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot on a live disk.\n\n*Go to Software & Updates, Additional Drivers, select the Broadcom one and Apply Changes. Wifi should work on the live session.\n\n*Then launch an Install of Ubuntu from the live session (eventually erasing your previous install).\n\n*Allow third-party softwares to be installed, and check the \"download updates\" option.\n\n*Restart.\n\n*Now, in the freshly installed ubuntu, I couldn't select the broadcom driver anymore and wifi was down.\n\n*I downloaded the driver from here on another PC:\nhttp://packages.ubuntu.com/utopic/admin/bcmwl-kernel-source\nAnd put in on a USB stick.\n\n*On my dell I simply double-clicked on it and the ubuntu software center installed it.

I have 2 laptops, one with windows 7 installed in its internal drive and an external usb drive with ubuntu 14 installed in it, connected all the time to pick whichever os i'd like to boot up with via grub2.  (by the way grub2 shows up most of the time but still occasionally windows boots up directly, bypassing grub2)  The other laptop is just windows 8.1 in its internal drive. Problem is, when I try to connect this external drive with ubuntu to my second laptop with windows 8.1.  Its a sony vaio, the boot menu could only be opened if you switch on using the assist button. I did, then changed the primary harddrive to external usb harddrive with ubuntu but it just doesn't see it. Could someone please shed some light on this ultra-mega-hiper noob problem? I though installing grub2 into my second laptop but that seems not necessary given that it works from the external when connected to the other laptop.\n\nA: Windows also has a fast boot option that has to be turned off. Here's an instructional site on how to disable that. You can also change the default operating system to see if that helps.\n", "Q: Can't access my encrypted home folder My problem is the following:\nI decided to do an apt-get dist-upgrade. At first it said that it had to remove a lot of programs, which seemed a little suspicious, but I trusted the upgrade system. I said to myself \"well, maybe there are dependencies issues, and it's easier for the update system to remove those programs and install the newer ones. We are in the year 2015, it probably knows what it's doing\". Well, it didn't, since it deleted the OS basically.\nSo now my problem is the following: I can't recover my personal files because my home folder is encrypted, and I don't have the mount passphrase, only my user password. I searched all the web but I couldn't find anything that solved my problem. I tried booting from a live-cd and recover the passphrase with ecryptfs-unwrap-passphrase but it was worthless, because when I try, it asks me for my... passphrase (I tried my user password but it didn't work out).\nI also tried using this script, but it only outputs unrecognized characters.\nI tried the approaches suggested here but eventually they didn't work out, basically when I'm asked for my passphrase, which I couldn't recover yet with any of those methods.\nAny suggestions?\n\nEDIT: @zhongfu\nI did that, and I get the following:\nINFO: Found [MYUSER].\nTry to recover this directory? [Y/n]: y\nINFO: Could not find your wrapped passphrase file.\nINFO: To recover this directory, you MUST have your original MOUNT passphrase.\nINFO: When you first setup your encrypted private directory, you were told to record\nINFO: your MOUNT passphrase.\nINFO: It should be 32 characters long, consisting of [0-9] and [a-f].\nEnter your MOUNT passphrase:\n\nso we are back at square one. So I went to /media/xubuntu/f6c13be2-8045-4ec6-b1af-c1f2524de4ed/home/.ecryptfs/MYUSER/.ecryptfs and there is a file called wrapped-pashprasse, so apparently there is a wrapped passphrase, and I don’t know why it said that it couldn’t find it earlier. Next I did ecryptfs-unwrap-passphrase, I enter my account password, but I get the same result. I don't know what else to do.\nI opened the wrapped passhprase file with gedit and got strange symbols mixed with hex values. If I could see correctly what characters the strange symbols are encoding, I could get the passphrase, but I don't know how.\nI was thinking, maybe if I could get the binary representation of that file, I could convert those symbols into hex by myself, right?\n\nA: You can try using ecryptfs-recover-private. \n\n\n*\n\n*Boot into your live CD, preferably an Ubuntu one of a newer version\n\n*Mount the partition containing your home directory (either your root partition, or your /home partition if you have one)\n\n*In your terminal, navigate to the directory containing your home directory (should be something like /media/PARTITION_UUID/home)\n\n*Run ecryptfs-recover-private USERNAME. It should prompt you with a few questions, and if it's successful, it will return a directory to which your home folder is mounted read-only. (e.g. /tmp/ecryptfs.Jd7xE2Bd)\n\n\nA: I had the same problem and your question was really useful to me. For the future, these are the things I needed to do:\n\n\n*\n\n*First, locate the ecryptfs directory. In my case, it was located in /media/.../home/.ecryptfs/<user>/.ecryptfs instead of my home folder.\n\n*In that directory, get the wrapped-passphrase file. Get the mount password running sudo ecryptfs-unwrap-passphrase /path/to/wrapped-passphrase and entering the user's password. It's important to use sudo.\n\n*Then, run sudo ecryptfs-recover-private on the .Private directory. In my case, it was located in /media/.../home/.ecryptfs/<user>/.Private. Use the password obtained in step 2.\n\nA: I had the same problem this weekend after upgrading to kubuntu 18.04.  I realized, belatedly, that I hadn't recently archived my files and, while I didn't format the /home partition, I couldn't access the files therein.  The above didn't work for me, but should have.  I could find and unwrap the wrapped passphrase, but plugging it into either method above didn't work.\nI eventually found a bug report which doesn't seem to be causing my problem, but did expose a way to get in.  I started with keyctl clear @u to clear the stored keys (run everything as sudo).  Run ecryptfs-mount-private on the appropriate directory to generate the two keys.  Next run ecryptfs-unwrap-passphrase .ecryptfs/wrapped-passphrase as in the solutions above, and copy the displayed passphrase that is called PPPP... in the link (if you get a passphrase here you have entered the correct login password).\nNext run sudo ecryptfs-add-passphrase --fnek as in the bug report and paste the copied passphrase.  Follow the remaining instructions from the bug report exactly and you should have access again.  Copy somewhere safe and continue.\n", "Q: Have internet connection but can't ping External sites I have an Internet connection and can browse, but I can't ping the google DNS,\nping 8.8.8.8\n\nnor can I ping google.com\nAny ideas why this might occur?\n\nA: Your Firewall is configured to block all ICMP packets.

I ran do-release-upgrade to upgrade to 14.04, and it seemed to run without issue. The only mistake I think I may have made was that it prompted me to update or keep the grub file, and I told it to update, but I don't think I had anything custom there.\nNow, I never get to a prompt.

I am hoping someone has a real solution to this problem.  I have a laptop with a 17\" (382x215 mm) display running at 1920x1080, approximately 128 PPI (DPI).  I wish to get Ubuntu set up properly on this display.  This means that when I select a 72-point font, capital letters will be exactly 1\" (2.54 cm) high, and applications such as LibreOffice will display documents with true-to-life measurements when scaled to 100%.\nI have tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Starting X with -dpi 128 (by modifying /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf), no apparent effect\n\n*Adding my display dimensions to my xorg.conf file, no apparent effect\n\n*Setting the DPI with xrandr --dpi 128, no apparent effect\n\n*Setting org.gnome.desktop.interface.text-scaling-factor to 1.33 (128/96), fonts get bigger, but are still not large enough\n\n\nIncreasing the text-scaling-factor to 1.93 displays fonts in the correct size (72pt M in character map measures 1 inch tall), however this makes the whole UI wacky, and requires to reduce my UI font sizes to 5-6 in order to be usable.  Unfortunately Unity itself does not pick up on these changes, and so searches in the dash, etc. have absurdly huge fonts.  \nIn addition to all this, the non-font UI elements are still too large. I feel like I need to set com.ubuntu.user-interface.scale-factor to 7 (scale for menus and title bars = 0.875), which of course requires increasing the text-scaling-factor accordingly, and everything just looks like a mess.\nWhy is this so difficult?  Calibrating one's screen should be a simple, basic task that every user does when first installing Ubuntu.  What I am asking here is, how can I achieve the perfect setup, where fonts appear correctly sized, the UI isn't too huge, and layouts of Unity and other applications are all appropriate?\n\nA: For LibreOffice, I just found a simple solution.\nClick on Tools > Options > LibreOffice > View\nAdjust the scaling figure (default 100%) to the size you need. For me setting it to 106% meant that when LibreOffice says a document is displayed at 100% it really is the width of the paper.\n", "Q: Session started with startx disappears after switching virtual console I am using Xubuntu 14.04.

With the second possibility usually you don't make it to the login screen, so I kind of doubt that's it, but a corrupt install remains a possibility.   \nThis sort of sounds like a common Unity malfunction.  The forums are full of Ubuntu 14.04 users trying, usually in vain, to make Unity work.  If it'll let you, and it sounds like you may have to do it from the command prompt, you'll need to install another desktop/ interface.  If you're having this amount of trouble with Unity I'm not sure whether to try Gnome or not; it's the most popular alternative.   \nYou can also avoid Unity by installing another flavor of Ubuntu.  The only difference is the interface.  There is no advantage in terms of learning Ubuntu from the books to using Unity; it doesn't resemble what is in the books on how to use Ubuntu. Try Kubuntu or Xubuntu.   There are also prepackaged versions like Zorin, which is free to try but costs $12.50 for full functionality; however, on systems old enough to not even get to square one with unity, the install often hangs.  You can install the trial version.  I just installed Ubuntu on a slightly older computer with an older processor and onboard graphics; the Zorin install hung, but Unity held up long enough to install the gnome desktop, which of course was the first thing I did.      \nThe reason why Unity doesn't work appears to be incompatible video cards.  Much is often made of the drivers, but they don't seem to be the problem. There isn't any particular driver that causes issues nor driver solution that fixes them, and indeed most people who run into this problem can't fix it by changing drivers.  It is often suspected of being a video issue, and I was outright getting warnings that my graphics might not be able to do what I was doing so did I want to do it.  I found a warning that it is important to make the choice when offered not to use the option that may slow your graphics, or speed up your graphics but slow your computer, or whatever.  CPU resource intensive graphics features that you don't need, that might be resolved by a high powered gaming video card but most people running Ubuntu don't have that.  \nAnd what is more, gnome with the cairo dock LOOKS far nicer (with the low powered graphics option on Cairo dock).   I don't even know how what could have thought of that side-slide thing.     \nNow, mind you, half the world's video cards seem to be incompatible with Unity.  I actually read, within the past week, a blog by an organizational psychologist or something of the sort, thinking that the reason why the Unity desktop is having popularity issues is that it was developed in an isolated laboratory and users weren't consulted, as if they had been they wouldn't care, no matter how terrible Unity actually is.  I think the key is the part about an isolated laboratory.  They didn't use real world computers and have no clue that Unity doesn't work on them; rest of world of course didn't take long to discover that. \nYou could with Ubuntu 12 or 13 and see if you get the same problem; I believe they are both missing Unity.   I myself was able to log in, though my system would only stay usable for about 15 minutes.   And I had to constantly log out and do stuff in command line to get the graphics back.   \nReading between the lines, you had another OS, or more than one OS, installed on this hard drive, and you wiped it and installed Ubuntu?  \nThe boot loader may be confused. When this sort of thing happens to me I simply repeat the install, and I've never had it not clear up.\nAlso, now, it's only been a week since I last installed Ubuntu...  I'm pretty sure I did have to install it twice, it had Windows...   but do pay close attention and make sure that if it gives you the option, and it probably does, you do start completely fresh with a new boot loader, boot partition, everything, I mean, delete ALL the partitions that may have been there.  And if that's the first time you've tried that you might get to repeat it yet again.\nThat's been my experience, the last two times I've installed Ubuntu.  One had Windows installed on it and the other had two Linux OS's.\nDora\n", "Q: I can't run \"sudo\" on a certain command, because its not in the sudo path. How can I give the right permissions then?

Perhaps setting up my memory drives (with / on the SSD, and /home mounted on the HDD) was a very bad idea?\n\nA: Looks like the permissions in your ~/ are messed up. All files there should be owned by you. Use find ~/ -user rootto see if root has taken over some of it, especially the directory’s in the error you posted. Change permissions back to yourself where necessary.  \nWhere did you get \"pip\" and how was it installed?\n\nA: I don't know if this will work, but I'd try creating the directory independent of opening or installing your software package.   \nI really don't know why you shouldn't be able to write to your home directory.  It is YOUR home directory, right?  Because if you tried to install it to someone else's home directory that would explain it.  \nDo you just have one Linux installation on your hard drive?  If you have more than one it's real easy to get mixed up about which logical drive you're logged in on.  \nIf you do sudo su you will be logged in as root and can do anything you want to - but be careful because it is also much easier to break your system.   \n", "Q: Managing space between smaller system drive and a larger extension drive I have two drives, one with 150 GB and another with 1 TB.

It's the same OS, but looking other.\nAlso, if you want to have GNOME (or other desktop environment - there are lots of them!) without installing system again it is possible and pretty easy. To see what desktop environments are available and how to install them you can head to What kinds of desktop environments and shells are available? .\n\nA: It is easier to install the version of Ubuntu with your preferred desktop environment as the default. If you install plain Ubuntu, add the package for Gnome (or any other desktop), then delete Unity, it will lead to quirky problems with your interface.

This could be great but unfortunately the screen says out of range when I try to start recovery mode, and in order to change the resolution for that screen I need to modify a file that requires root permissions.

One benefit of chrooting is that you don't have to edit any configuration files manually, and thus are somewhat less likely to make mistakes that worsen the situation.\nEven if the original administrator was removed on your system (rather than merely being made no longer an administrator), since you have a working user account who you wish to make an administrator, this technique should do what you need.\n\n  \n*\n  \n*If you don't already have one, burn an Ubuntu live CD/DVD (on Ubuntu, Windows, or Mac OS X) or write an Ubuntu live\n  USB flash drive (on Ubuntu, Windows, or Mac OS X).\n  \n*If you know the device name of the partition that contains your Ubuntu system's root filesystem, feel free to skip to step 5.\n  \n*In your Ubuntu system (not the live CD/DVD/USB system), run this command in the Terminal:\nmount | grep ' on / '\n\nYou should include the spaces before on and after /.\n  \n*That command produces something like /dev/sda1 on / type ext4 (rw,errors=remount-ro,commit=0) as the output. The text before on\n  (not including the space) is the device name of the partition that\n  contains your Ubuntu system's root filesystem.

I needed Ubuntu for dual-boot, and since I knew that I would not use it that often, I installed it on my other drive. The goal was to not have any GRUB popping up on every PC startup, I just wanted to go straight into Windows, unless I press F8 to go to boot selection and choose HDD when I need Ubuntu (not changing boot priority). Honestly, it is just for one game (kerbal space program anyone? :D) and trying Ubuntu out before installing it on my dads very old computer that is slowly dying, and give it some fresh air.\nI have one SSD as my windows drive, and one HDD for storage. I did not want the Ubuntu installation even look at my windows SSD under the installation.\n\n\n*\n\n*I created a new partition on my HDD for Ubuntu (in windows),\n\n*Disconnected the SSD\n\n*Booted to LiveCD from a USB and installed Ubuntu on the storage HDD with 2gb swap area and root partition\n\n*Selected /dev/sda for boot loader installation\n\n\nI thought that this should work just fine, and it did until I plugged my SSD back in. I assumed that the boot priority would be the same as before, 1. SSD 2. HDD, but instead to boot from the SSD, it went straight to Ubuntu. When I entered bios to check what's up, there was no SSD in the boot priority list, just the HDD. However, the SSD showed up in the boot menu. So I could boot windows manually. What I did was to disconnect the HDD, boot with just the SSD plugged in, reconnect HDD. Now, only the SSD was in the boot priority list, but both of my drives were in the boot menu thing. What? This accomplished my goal, though. I would boot straight into windows unless I press F8 and select to boot the HDD instead. But it would be nice to have boot priority working. Should I install the ubuntu bootloader on the Ubuntu partition instead? If so, how do I remove GRUB from the HDD, assuming I remove Ubuntu as well. Since SSD MBR works just fine, I don't need any mbrfixes. All of the guides I have seen are just about fixing windows loader that has been goofed by Ubuntu installation. Or am I just completely wrong? :D\n\nA: Personally, I think it would be better to have both OS's installed on the same drive, and have that drive be the one that boots.  Then boot and when GRUB asks you to choose an OS, make a note of how many spots down the Windows option is but boot Ubuntu.\nOnce you're in Ubuntu, open a terminal and make it so that you can change the grub file by using the command:\n\nsudo chown me:me /etc/default/grub\n\nNow open it for edit in the terminal with:\n\nsudo nano -b /etc/default/grub\n\nUsing arrows, go to where it says GRUB_DEFAULT and change the number after it to be how many spots down the Windows boot is, minus 1.  (So if it were 3 spots down, you would use 2, for example.)  Now, go to where it says \nGRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT and change the number after that to 0.  Below that, it says GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT_QUIET, change it so it says \"true\" after that.  (Make sure you're not taking away the colons between each selection and what I've told you to enter, and that you are replacing what was there previously not simply adding to it.  That may seem fairly obvious, and you may feel the clarification is unnecessary, but I don't want you accidentally screwing up your grub file beyond repair simply because I was not clear enough.)  Now hit Ctrl+X and it will ask you if you want to save.  Hit \"Y\" and it will ask you for a file name to save as.  Just hit \"Enter\".  Now you will need to run a final command to finalize this:\n\nsudo update-grub\n\nNow, it should automatically boot into Windows without the GRUB folder showing, and if you ever want to boot Ubuntu instead then as your computer turns on (before it is starting to boot an OS) hold Shift and keep it pressed until the GRUB options show up.  You will be able to boot Ubuntu from those GRUB options.\nI think this would be the easiest way for it to automatically boot Windows, but have Ubuntu available.  I think it's much better than having the two installed on different drives.\n\nA: As you mention in a comment that your computer uses EFI, you should be aware that BIOS assumptions (which you used in your installation plan) often fail miserably on EFI-based computers. Contrary to what most people seem to think, EFI is a completely new boot system, not some minor tweak or add-on to BIOS. That's one reason why I cringe every time I see somebody refer to an EFI as a BIOS, or even as an \"EFI BIOS;\" referring to an EFI as a BIOS encourages applying BIOS assumptions where they don't belong.\nThat said, most EFI-based computers include a Compatibility Support Module (CSM), which enables them to boot just like BIOS-based computers. Thus, even an EFI-based computer might be booting in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode, so what I wrote about BIOS assumptions not applying might be completely wrong for a specific computer that's configured in a particular way. You must assess your actual boot mode to determine whether this is the case. See this page for details. In brief, though, if the /sys/firmware/efi directory exists under Ubuntu, Ubuntu is booting in EFI mode; if it's absent, you're booting in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode. Under Windows, boot mode is tied to partition table type; if the disk uses GPT, you're booting Windows in EFI mode, and if it's MBR, you're booting in BIOS mode. Note that you might be booting one OS in one mode and the other OS in another mode. Such a cross-mode installation complicates things a great deal.\nAssuming you're booting both OSes in EFI mode, to achieve your desired goal, you must boot one OS and create an NVRAM entry for the other OS. In Linux, you can do this with the efibootmgr tool. Unfortunately, I don't know of a good and comprehensive tutorial about it. You can read its man page (man efibootmgr) or read how to accomplish various specific tasks on various sites, including this one:\n\n\n*\n\n*Having Trouble adding UEFI entry using efibootmgr\n\n*Change boot order using efibootmgr\n\n*Removing entries from UEFI menu with efibootmgr\n\n*Sony VAIO with Insyde H2O EFI bios will not boot into GRUB EFI\n\n*Explaination of my \"efibootmgr -v\" output\nSearch and you'll find more.\nI'm less familiar with Windows tools, but you might look into the third-party EasyUEFI, which is a GUI tool for managing EFI boot entries.\nIf you're booting both OSes in BIOS mode, my suspicion is that you're running into subtle differences between the way a true BIOS and your EFI's CSM are detecting bootable disks. I've run into this myself; CSMs tend to be less thorough in creating BIOS/CSM/legacy-mode boot entries than do BIOSes. If so, your best option is probably to rely on GRUB. Yes, I know you say you don't want to do that, but you can configure GRUB with a short timeout and to boot Windows by default, as described in this question and answer.\nIf you're booting one OS in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode and the other in EFI mode, I strongly recommend that you re-install or re-configure so that they're both booting in the same mode. Cross-mode configurations are awkward at best, so I don't recommend you use them unless you must and you're an expert. Update your question with details, or better yet, post a new question with details, if this is the case.\n", "Q: How to kill a single thread from Terminal in Ubuntu? I'm new to Ubuntu and new here.

If it's still slow, something's wrong with your Firefox installation.\nReinstall half of your Add Ons to see if one or more of them is slow.  Use a binary search to determine which Add On it might be.  Warning: More than one Add On might be a problem.

The only way to fix it is go to about:config (you write it where you write the pages url) and search for ipv6. Then change network.dns.disableIPv6 to true (maybe my router doesn't support IPv6 and causes firefox to search for it but it isn't needed yet so you won't have any problem and I think older versions had IPv6 disabled by default). After this, pages load within 1 sec.\n", "Q: How can I delete files or folders created by Nano editor? I've searched a method to change the brightness of my laptop display.

IGMP is an integral part of IP multicast.\"\nI do not use UFW, but in my iptables rule set I have a rule to drop those packets without logging, so as to avoid clutter in my log files.\n", "Q: Using IPEGA bluetooth gamepad with Steam @ Linux I have successfully paired gamepad IPEGA PG-9025 (bluetooth) with my notebook (Ubuntu 14.10).\nIPEGA PG-9025 can handle 4 different device modes when pairing, but only one makes sense for Steam gaming - Joystick Mode, so I pressed X and Home keys together and pairing was successful in a minute.\nSteam does not see my gamepad /dev/input/js0 and I absolutely don't know how to fix it.\n\nA: There is working solution (you must create remapped virtual xbox gamepad using xboxdrv software, which works great in Steam Big Screen and Steam Games):\n\n\n*\n\n*install xboxdrv sudo apt-get install xboxdrv\n\n*connect your ipega bluetooth gamepad and pair it with computer (hold X button and HOME button together, device is ready to pair when red LED blinking fast and successfully connected when red LED lights continuously)\n\n*find XX number (/dev/input/eventXX) of connected gamepad using command cat /proc/bus/input/devices\n\n*at the end, create virtual xbox compatible gamepad using command:\nsudo xboxdrv --evdev /dev/input/eventXX --evdev-absmap ABS_X=x1,ABS_Y=y1,ABS_Z=x2,ABS_RZ=y2,ABS_HAT0X=dpad_x,ABS_HAT0Y=dpad_y --axismap -Y1=Y1,-Y2=Y2 --evdev-keymap BTN_A=a,BTN_B=b,BTN_X=x,BTN_Y=y,BTN_TL=lb,BTN_TR=rb,BTN_TL2=lt,BTN_TR2=rt,BTN_THUMBL=tl,BTN_THUMBR=tr,BTN_SELECT=back,BTN_START=start --silent &\n\nDon't forget to replace eventXX with value, discovered in step 3.\nNOTE: remapping scheme, used in step 4. http://goo.gl/XFhYvI is usable probably only for ipega controllers, if you have another gamepad manufacturer, just follow these instructions https://steamcommunity.com/app/221410/discussions/0/558748653738497361/.\n", "Q: Problem with google chrome icon in launcher (left bar) I am using ubuntu 14.04 and have a problem with launcher (the left bar with bunch of icons).  \nThere is a Google Chrome icon on the launcher.

Is there a way to use different folders views each folder ? Some folders i like to see as icons and others is better to see as list.\n\n\nA: Since nautilus does not have a command line option to switch between list- and icon view, nor has the option to set view prferences per folder, there is no clean way to do that.\nStarted as an experiment, the option below was to see if it could be done anyway in a reasonably functional way.\nAs mentioned in a comment, the solution is as dirty as it gets, but it turned out to be fully functional, and in the hours that I tested it, I did not run into issues. The decision to use it or not is yours.\nThe scripts and what they do\nThe solution consists of two scripts; one to be run from a shortcut key to add the active (nautilus) window to a list. Listed windows will be automatically set to list view, other windows are in icon view by default. Of course you can set it vice versa, depending on what view type you'd like to set as default\nThe switch from / to list view is done by simulating either Ctrl+1 or Ctrl+2, which are the shortcuts in nautilus to set list- or icon view.\nHow it works in practice\nRunning the first script in the background, the default view for nautilus windows is icon view.\nIf you want to set list view for a specific folder, you navigate to the folder (open it), with the folder's window opened and frontmost, press (e.g. Ctrl+Alt+A)\nThis will add the window's name to a list (kept in a hidden file in your home directory). The next time you open the folder, it will automatically switch to list view, and back to icon view when you navigate tyo another folder.\nTo remove the folder from the list, press Ctrl+Alt+R with the folder in question in front.\nHow to set up\n\n\n*\n\n*The scripts need both wmctrl and xdotool:\nsudo apt-get install wmctrl\nsudo apt-get install xdotool\n\n\n*Copy the script below into an empty file, save it as add_folder.py This is the script to add or remove the window to/from list view.\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport subprocess\nimport os\nimport sys\n\nadd = sys.argv[1]\n\nwlist = os.environ[\"HOME\"]+\"/.window_list.txt\"\n\nget = lambda cmd: subprocess.check_output(cmd).decode(\"utf-8\")\nwindow = get([\"xdotool\", \"getactivewindow\", \"getwindowname\"]).strip()+\"\\n\"\n\ndef add_window():\n    if os.path.exists(wlist):\n        current = open(wlist).readlines()\n        if not window in current:\n            new = current+[window]\n            open(wlist, \"w\").writelines(new)\n    else:\n        open(wlist, \"w\").write(window)\n\ndef remove_window():\n    if os.path.exists(wlist):\n        current = open(wlist).readlines()\n        if window in current:\n            current.remove(window)\n            open(wlist, \"w\").writelines(current)\n\nif add == \"+\":\n    add_window()\nelif add == \"-\":\n    remove_window()\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Test run the script by the command:\npython3 /path/to/add_folder.py +\n\nA hidden file should be created in ~/home, named .window_list.txt. You will need to press Ctrl+H to make it visible (files with a name, starting wit a '.' are invisible by default)\nIf it works fine, add both commands:\n   python3 /path/to/add_folder.py +\n   python3 /path/to/add_folder.py -\n\nto a shortcut key combination (I used Ctrl+Alt+R and Ctrl+Alt+A): choose: System Settings > \"Keyboard\" > \"Shortcuts\" > \"Custom Shortcuts\".

(remember, the list view will be activated the next time you open the folder)\nThat's it!\nNote\nSince the script does not see if the listed folders still exist in your directories, the file ~/.window_list.txt might include some outdated entries over time if you delete listed folders.\nYou can prevent dat by either use the shortcut you set to do so, or simply walk through the file every once and a while.\n", "Q: Can SANE daemon communicate with a remote network scanner? My understanding is that SANE is a service that sits between programs that perform scanning tasks and the physical scanner itself.\nAlso SANE provides an API to the programs that it then relays to the physical machine.\nThe typical setup seems to be where the scanner is connected directly to the computer, can SANE still communiate with the scanner and provide that same API when the scanner is located remotely over a network?\n\nA: Yes, that's possible.

I'd like to institute some time based access to the server.  I host media for the whole house, and the goal is for the kids' televisions to become useless at a certain time.  I have placed the following into root's crontab:\n  0 22 *    *   0-4   /etc/init.d/samba stop \n  0 22 *    *   0-4   /etc/init.d/smbd stop \n  0 22 *    *   0-4   /etc/init.d/nmbd stop \n\nThe shares continue to be active passed the noted time.  What am I doing wrong?\n\nA: Your commands are not working because /etc/init.d/smbd and /etc/init.d/nmbd have the following at the start:\nif init_is_upstart; then\n                        exit 1\n                fi\n\nSo, as the init in ubuntu is now Upstart (/etc/init.d/ is from SysV), you need to run the start-stop scripts from the directory /etc/init/. /etc/init.d/ still exists for backward compatibility because many programs still use this directory. \nTo make things easier for you, Ubuntu has service command:\nsudo service smbd stop\nsudo service nmbd stop\n\nWhile running as root:\nservice smbd stop\nservice nmbd stop\n\nservice will first search in /etc/init/ directory and then /etc/init.d/. service is efficient in another sense that if there are two scripts having the same name in those two directories (as in case of smbd and nmbd) the Upstart script (in /etc/init/) will take precedence over SysV script (in /etc/init.d/). \nAlso your cron entry can be made simpler:\n0 22 * * 0-4  service samba stop && service smbd stop && service nmbd stop\n\n&& ensures that the next command is run only if the previous one is successful (i.e. exit code $?=0).\n", "Q: Error while loading shared libraries: libopenal.so.1 (Game 'pacapong' in Ubuntu 14.10) I downloaded the game pacapong for Linux and tried to run the executable, which results in the error: \n$ ./runner \n\n./runner: error while loading shared libraries: libopenal.so.1: \ncannot open shared object file: No such file or directory\n\nObviously, there is the necessity of loading libopenal.so.1:\n$ objdump -p ./runner |grep libopenal.so.1\n\nNEEDED libopenal.so.1\n\nThere is libopenal.so.1 lying in /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu and I can do:\n$ ldd libopenal.so.1\nlinux-vdso.so.1 =>  (0x00007fffcdbbb000)\n\n...\nI won't run this executable (./runner) as root (just in case this problem could be related to insufficient rights, what I'm not assuming).\nSo, what could I try else?\n\nA: The error is because this is a 32-bit game that you are trying to run in 64-bit Linux.

From my desktop computer after booting in Ubuntu 12.04 \nI could install it and use it without any problem.\nLater I tried to install it in a Samsung notebook (with Ubuntu 12.04 also) but I am having problems with it.\nI started installing (in the notebook) the epson-inkjet-printer-201207w_1.0.0-1lsb3.2_amd64.deb driver and installing the printer in CUPS through localhost:631.\nI could even print a test page correctly from within CUPS.\nThen I went to the Printers option (now I am using classic \ngnome) but no printer appears. Only a message with something \nlike \"printer service not available\" (I am translating).\nIf I write localhost in the Connect field then I can\nsee the printer (I could also print a test page from here).\nBut the printer does not appear when I want to print from \nwithin any application.\nCUPS is currently installed and running (I checked that).\nI tried reinstalling CUPS and it did not work.\nI also looked at the /etc/cups/error_log file but I \ndon't understand much of what is written there. \nHere goes the last part of it:\nD [12/Apr/2015:14:28:56 -0300] cupsdCloseClient: 13\nD [12/Apr/2015:14:28:56 -0300] cupsdSetBusyState: newbusy=\"Dirty files\", busy=\"Dirty files\"\nD [12/Apr/2015:14:28:56 -0300] cupsdReadClient: 16 WAITING Closing on EOF\nD [12/Apr/2015:14:28:56 -0300] cupsdCloseClient: 16\nD [12/Apr/2015:14:28:56 -0300] cupsdSetBusyState: newbusy=\"Dirty files\", busy=\"Dirty files\"\nI [12/Apr/2015:14:29:26 -0300] Saving subscriptions.conf...\nD [12/Apr/2015:14:29:26 -0300] cupsdSetBusyState: newbusy=\"Not busy\", busy=\"Dirty files\"\n\nWhat should I do?\n\nA: Taken from here on Ubuntu Forums:\n\nIt finally works!\nI found what I think could have been the reason for my troubles.  > There was an innocent-looking file /etc/cups/client.conf with the single line in it:\nServerName 192.168.1.36. \n\nIt was probably left after a previous attempt to print to another printer. Apparently after uninstalling cups completely that file was not erased (I thought everything was erased). I commented that line and started again.\nThen after restarting cups I ran system-config-printer again and choose the options that the program offered me by default. So in the end I did not use the ipp option (I could not find the correct path to make it print). I do not know if it is safe or good but the option suggested in the URI address was:\ndnssd://EPSON%20L355%20Series._pdl-datastream._tcp.local/\n\nand that has worked perfectly so far.\n\n\nA: As praseodym says, the static addresses need to be outside the range used by the router for DHCP. For example, if the router (in your case, the DSL appliance supplied by your ISP) assigns DHCP addresses from 192.168.1.2 to 192.168.1.50, for example, use static addresses from x.51 on up.\nIf you have Network Manager installed, you will find the process difficult unless you Edit Connections in NM and set the details there. Please see attached.I think there are two reasons. If a server is running headless, without a desktop manager, there is no other way to do it. Running headless means no keyboard, monitor and mouse. It means the overhead imposed by a windowing manager is lifted and, best of all, you can stick the thing in a closet or garage.\n", "Q: Total newbee, Mac, is 222GB too much space in partition? Can a partition on a Mac HD be too large for VM Ubuntu?  I partitioned 222GB when I first got my Mac Mini ; it has a T hard drive.  \n\nA: Most computers operating systems, even in Virtual Systems, are not very limited in how big a hard drive space they can manage. The only limit is perhaps the filesystem used - so for example, if ext4 is used , the maximium sensible limit is 16 tebibytes (roughly 1099 GB, 1024 GiB)\nSo as long as you have a space for Ubuntu of at least 10 GiB, it should be fine for most uses. I generally use a minimum of at least 50 GiB for the root system on installations I do (with at least 40 GiB for the home and up to 8 GiB swap space) - having a larger space available is not a problem and is usually a benefit, though you will want to leave some free space available for the Mac system.\n", "Q: Disconnected.You are now offline I turned off my computer accidentally while updating Ubuntu 14.O4 and now WiFi is not working when I connect it I'm getting this message: \nDisconnected.You are now offline \nAnd all options on the menu of connection are disabled.

This has been asked and answered for older versions, but these solutions no longer seem to work for 14.04.\nSpecifically, the version of Grub used in 14.04 now has two screens. The first screen lists:\nUbuntu (default)\nUbuntu advanced\nmemory test\nmemory test (other options)\n\nAnd all the other actual kernel options are hidden under the \"Ubuntu advanced\" sub-menu.\nI installed 14.04 server, but for some reason, it's using the generic-kernel. Unfortunately, the option to use the server kernel is listed under the \"Ubuntu advanced\" menu, and the GRUB_DEFAULT index in /etc/default/grub doesn't effect or select from those.\nI tested this by changing the GRUB_DEFAULT to 4, corresponding to the 5th option under the \"Ubuntu advanced\" grub menu, but it still booted using the \"Ubuntu (default)\" generic kernel. How do I fix this?\n\nA: For example if the desired default kernel to boot was the third one on the \"Ubuntu advanced\" menu, the the grub line would be:\nGRUB_DEFAULT=\"1>2\"\n\nThe lines start counting from 0, so the \"1\" means the second line of the first, or main menu, the \"Ubutnu advanced\" one. The \"2\" means the third line of that menu.\nBy the way, note that there is no longer any difference in Ubuntu kernels between desktop and server, they both now use the same kernel.\n\nA: You can disable submenus in Grub, by adding the following to /etc/default/grub:\nGRUB_DISABLE_SUBMENU=y\n\nAfter running update-grub again, you should be able to use the indices as you normally would.\n", "Q: Alsa problems with python2.7- Unable to open slave I am using python's module pyaudio to process sound but ALSA returns:\nALSA lib pcm_dsnoop.c:618:(snd_pcm_dsnoop_open) unable to open slave\n\nALSA lib pcm_dmix.c:1022:(snd_pcm_dmix_open) unable to open slave\n\nALSA lib pcm.c:2239:(snd_pcm_open_noupdate) Unknown PCM cards.pcm.rear\n\nALSA lib pcm.c:2239:(snd_pcm_open_noupdate) Unknown PCM cards.pcm.center_lfe\n\nALSA lib pcm.c:2239:(snd_pcm_open_noupdate) Unknown PCM cards.pcm.side\n\nbt_audio_service_open: connect() failed: Connection refused (111)\n\nbt_audio_service_open: connect() failed: Connection refused (111)\n\nbt_audio_service_open: connect() failed: Connection refused (111)\n\nbt_audio_service_open: connect() failed: Connection refused (111)\n\nALSA lib pcm_dmix.c:1022:(snd_pcm_dmix_open) unable to open slave\n\nCannot connect to server socket err = No such file or directory\n\nCannot connect to server request channel\n\njack server is not running or cannot be started\n\nAlsa works fine in recording sound and playing it from terminal, but python (2.7) keeps returning these errors.

I have Ubuntu and I got Emacs from the Ubuntu store.

For some reason this won't work on Emacs. How can I type the ^ character in Emacs?\n\nA: Usually, in Latin & other international keyboard layouts, if you type an accent prefix (known as \"dead key\") followed by the spacebar, you get the accent symbol itself.\nFor example, to get a circumflex accent you type ^A to get â, and if you type ^<space> you get ^.\nIn the Latin layout, you should have a key with { [ ^ symbols, so the ^ should use an Alt or AltGr key. Try to type that followed by space.\nThe same applies to ~ and other accents.\n", "Q: How to permanently change sysfs setting for certain block device? I have a disk which needs an increased SATA timeout to work properly (at least that's the current workaround, see comments at https://serverfault.com/questions/682061). I figured out that I can set this timeout by doing\nsudo sh -c 'echo 120 > /sys/block/sda/device/timeout'\n\nI can write this into a boot script or use the sysctl interface (right?) by putting this into /etc/sysctl.conf:\nsys.block.sda.device.timeout = 120\n\nHowever, due to my setup this disk might be sda, or sdb or sdd depending on what combinations of disks are available at boot time. So I have to identify it by UUID or label. Unfortunately, /sys only contains pointers to sdX and dm-X devices, not UUID or LABEL symlinks.\nBefore I start hacking my own solution: How should I uniquely address a block device (disk) in /sys to permanently change a setting like the timeout above?\n\nA: Take a look at /sys/block/sda/device.  It is a symlink to a real sysfs path that depends on the pci device ( the sata host controller ) and the port to which the drive is attached, and this isn't going to change unless you physically move the drive connection.\n", "Q: What is \"root\" and how can I become it? When I ran a command, I got the following error:\n\nYou need to be root to perform this command.\n\nWhat is root and how can I become it?\n\nA: What is \"root\"?\nroot is a user existing on every Linux system.\nTo be more precise, it is a special user - the super user!\nroot is the only user that has privileges to do everything.\nIn contrast to the two types of user accounts you can create (administrator users and restricted users), it exists by default and can neither be renamed or deleted. Usually, logging in as root is disabled for security reasons.\nYou may think that your admin user is the most powerful account on your machine and may do everything, but that is wrong. Simplified and in general, your admin user is almost equal to a restricted user in permissions. It also only has writing permissions in its own home folder and also may not change system wide settings.\nHowever, the admin users have one special and important privilege:\nHow to  become \"root\"?\nAs logging in as root is prohibited on Ubuntu per default, there has to be another way to become root in order to be able to perform important system wide administrative tasks. \nThe sudo command<-- (abbreviation for \"Super User DO ...\")\nAdministrator user accounts have the permission to use the sudo command to execute a single command as root/with root privileges.\nIt is simple. Just write sudo before every terminal command that needs special elevated permissions to run and execute it. It will show you a prompt and ask for a password like this (my username is bytecommander):\n[sudo] password for bytecommander:\n\nNote that you have to enter the password of your own admin account and not the (by default not existing) root user's password. It is also configured to only ask once every 15 minutes for your password, so the second invocation of sudo will run the command immediately. However, if you close the terminal window, the sudo ticket is also reset. Furthermore is it important for you to know that there will be no display output when you type the password, not even stars (*) will appear to symbolize the entered characters. Just type it and hit Enter.\nLet me give you an example on how/when to use sudo:\n\n\n*\n\n*apt-get is the command-line tool to run software updates and install new packages. This affects the whole system and therefore requires root permissions. Therefore, whenever we need to invoke apt-get, we have to do this with sudo:\nsudo apt-get install vlc\n\nwould for example install the famous media player VLC (after asking for your password, if you did not enter it in the current terminal window within the last 15 minutes). If we ran the command as normal user without sudo (apt-get install vlc only), it would result in this error:\n\nE: Could not open lock file /var/lib/dpkg/lock - open (13: Permission denied)\n  E: Unable to lock the administration directory (/var/lib/dpkg/), are you root?\n\nHow to proceed with graphical applications instead of terminal commands?\nSometimes you need to run a graphical application (such as e.g. the Files manager, a special editor or an additional tweak tool) with root privileges. In this case, please do not use sudo, as this is only for terminal commands. For several reasons I don't want to discuss here, it may lead to severe problems (see this answer for further explanations)... \nSo for graphical applications, there are other commands which are safer to run GUI apps and which provide a graphical popup-window to request your password instead of a terminal window. Those are mainly gksu and gksudo. Experts are arguing which of them is to prefer, but for the normal Ubuntu user, both can be taken equally. The syntax is the same as with sudo. For example, we can run the file manger Nautilus with root privileges by:\ngksudo nautilus\n\n\nA: root is the user name or account that by default has access to all commands and files on a Linux or other Unix-like operating system. It is also referred to as the root account, root user and the superuser.\nSo there will arise certain cases when you will have to be logged in as root user to run those commands. Do not worry it is simple.\nBy default, the root account password is locked in Ubuntu. This means that you cannot log in as root directly or use the su command to become the root user. However, since the root account physically exists it is still possible to run programs with root-level privileges. This is where \n    sudo \n\ncomes in - it allows authorized users to run certain programs as root without having to know the root password.\nThis means that in the terminal you should use sudo for commands that require root privileges; simply prepend sudo to all the commands you need to run as root. You will be prompted for a password when you sudo. Just remember, when sudo asks for a password, it needs YOUR USER password, and not the root account password.\nWhen using sudo, your password is stored by default for 15 minutes. After that time, you will need to enter your password again.\nYour password will not be shown on the screen as you type it, not even as a row of stars (******). It is being entered with each keystroke!\nFor more info please refer: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo\n", "Q: How do I fix(make) apps windows to be opened at desired place of the desktop?

To be able to launch it conveniently,\n\n\n*\n\n*I symlinked the path to eclipse to /usr/bin, (so that it can be started by running the command eclipse from a terminal)\n\n*I created a .desktop file, to start it from the dash.\n\n*After starting from the dash, I locked the icon that appeared to the Launcher.\n\n\nThis all works, the icon specified in the .desktop file shows (after some trial and error) and everything.\nHowever, when I run eclipse from terminal, it does not use the item that I locked to the Launcher, but creates a new one. When I start Eclipse through the dash, it does use the item locked to the Launcher. Furthermore, when running eclipse from the terminal, it apparently does not know which icon to use, since it shows a grey sheet with a question mark instead.\nI would like Ubuntu to recognize that I'm executing the same command in both cases, and have it treat them identically. How can this be achieved?\n\nA: Not 100% sure on Unity, as I don't have an install to test with. However this works on Gnome on 14.10. \ngtk-launch eclipe\n\nassuming your desktop file is eclipse.desktop. If not just change eclipse to whatever you named the desktop file without the .desktop extension\n\nA: It seems that the issue was that there were multiple .desktop files for the same Eclipse executable. Deleting all but one of them solved the issue.\nIf you launch Eclipse before creating a .desktop file, then right-click that Eclipse in the launcher and click Lock to launcher, Ubuntu goes about this by automatically creating a .desktop file for you, behind the scenes.\nIf you unlock it from the launcher later on, the auto-generated .desktop file is not removed. Of course, if you then manually create a .desktop file, there are two .desktop files, and this may result in the behaviour described in the question.\n", "Q: How to install Asus USB-N14 Adapter?

To do that you'd need to make sure windows shuts down properly. I believe this is referred to in windows as \"Fast Startup\" or something similar.\nIf your windows drive appears in the file manager and you try to open it, a more specific version of the mount command may be shown in the error message that pops up.\n\nA: do you still have windows , are you dual booting ?\nThe files from windows will not appear in your Ubuntu system , it is another clean system .\nIf you still have windows you can access the files on the windows partition from Ubuntu but if you installed over windows (used the whole disk) they are gone!\n", "Q: I deleted my resolv.conf how do I get it back or how do I create it again I was changing my DHCP IP address to static on my server by \nsudo gedit /etc/network/interfaces and managed to edit the file and save it.\nI then went to change resolv.conf but then it went blank and every time I rebooted it was blank.\nI then deleted it by accident.\nNow I can't install anything with apt-get or aptitude. \n\nA: /etc/resolv.conf is automatically generated upon reboot by resolvconf if its a symbolic link to /run/resolvconf/resolv.conf (the file resolvconf writes to), you don't need to create it or edit it. You can put your name servers in /etc/network/interfaces using the following syntax so that they get added to /etc/resolv.conf automatically:\ndns-nameservers <IP_address> <IP_address> <IP_address>\n\nFor example:\ndns-nameservers 8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4\n\nyou should add this line at the end of your static IP configuration block.\nIf you have removed the symlink /etc/resolv.conf, run sudo dpkg-reconfigure resolvconf and you will come up with a set of questions to set it right again. Now do a reboot or run the following:\nsudo ifdown eth0 && sudo ifup eth0  ##Change interface name accordingly\n\nEverything should be fine.\n\nA: To restore the symbolic link /etc/resolv.conf -> ../run/resolvconf/resolv.conf, execute the command sudo dpkg-reconfigure resolvconf at a command prompt.\nIf you are configuring your Internet-facing network interface using the ifup utility (whose configuration file is /etc/network/interfaces) then add nameserver information to the corresponding stanza in /etc/network/interfaces. Usually this entails adding at least a dns-nameservers option to the stanza in question. E.g., \niface eth0 inet static\n    address 192.168.22.33\n    netmask 255.255.255.0\n    dns-nameservers 192.168.22.1\n\nThen when you ifup eth0, the address 192.168.22.1 will be added by resolvconf to resolv.conf (on an option line: nameserver 192.168.22.1).\n\nA: You could also run:\nsudo ln -s /run/resolvconf/resolv.conf /etc/resolv.conf\n\nTo restore the symbolic link.\n", "Q: Grub unaccessible after windows 10 and ubuntu 14 install I would like to be able to dual boot on windows 10 and Ubuntu 14.\nFirst, I tried to install windows 10 after Ubuntu 14.

My understanding is that debian based packages have \"control files\" which specify metadata on how the packages is to be installed, e.g. what dependencies it has etc.  \nHow can I view these files for installed packages?\n\nA: The *deb file are not kept for installed packages. To view the control file for a given package:\napt download <package name>\ndpkg-deb -I <package name*deb> control\n\nTo get a list of installed packages:\napt list --installed\n\n\nA: Open the .deb file in file roller or whatever archiver you have on your system. Then go to the debian folder.  In there, you will find the file control which contains the metadata.\n\nA: For dependency information, you can see /var/lib/dpkg/status, which basically lists the contents of debian/control (with some additional information about the package itself) for each installed package.\nAdditionally, you can look into /var/lib/dpkg/info to see the files installed, pre/post (un)installation scripts (if any), and configuration files (if any) for each installed package.\n", "Q: How to create a LiveUSB install for Ubuntu 14.04 Server How do you create a LiveUSB for Ubuntu 14.04?\nI downloaded the most recent ISO and used the \"startup disk\" creator to write that ISO to a USB drive.

Although the machine does technically have a CD drive, I want to install from the USB drive...which the installer is running from.\nThis question has been asked before, but it seems the current Ubuntu 14.04 installer requires a CD-ROM, which makes no sense to me. What am I missing?\n\nA: Have you checked the integrity of the image before and after it was transferred to the USB? (make sure to replace sdx with the correct identifier).\nYou can compare the output with the hashes listed here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuHashes (it should match exactly both times)\nmd5sum /path/to/ubuntu.iso\n\nIf this first check doesn't match, you must download the file again and check it again (and potentially repeat that process, although its unlikely), until it matches.\nmd5sum /dev/sdxn\n\n(Note that this is running md5sum on a partition, not a device) If the hash matched above but not once it's on the USB drive, you need to copy the image onto the drive again.\nIn addition to tool that you used, you can use dd:\ndd if=/path/to/ubuntu.iso of=/dev/sdx\n\nOf course, you'll want to be extremely careful you write to the correct device. Also keep in mind that calculating the MD5 will take some time for such a large image, so be patient.\n", "Q: How to change selinux modes permissive to enforce in ubuntu 14.04 How to change selinux modes from permissive to enforcing in ubuntu 14.04.\nI tried \n# vim /etc/selinux/config\nSELINUX=enforcing\nsave and quiet\n# init 6\n\nafter that ... no luck.\nwhen i execute getenforce command showing Disabled.\n\nA: Simply run setenforce 1 as root.

Unfortunately, the icons for dash search and Emacs haven't changed, either in the dash or on the launcher, even though all the other ones have. Does anybody know why this is happening or how to fix it?\n\nA: I eventually figured this out. The secret is to find the .desktop file (for me, this was /usr/share/applications/emacs24.desktop), and open it with sudo in the text editor of your choice. Then, you can edit the icon line to point to your desired icon.\n\nA: Sometimes applications use their own paths for the icon.\nIn this case, Emacs uses the following path:\n/usr/share/icons/hicolor/scalable/apps/emacs24.svg\n\nTo change this behaviour, the file emacs24.desktop can be changed.\nsudo nano /usr/share/applications/emacs24.desktop\n\nReplace this line:\nIcon=/usr/share/icons/hicolor/scalable/apps/emacs24.svg\n\nwith this line:\nIcon=emacs\n\nAfter that, it may be necessary to restart \"Unity\":\nunity &> /dev/null & disown\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu doesn't showup while booting I have recently installed Ubuntu 14.04 along side Windows 8 in my Samsung Series 5 np535u4c notebook in a 52 gb disk called Ubuntu.\nUbuntu grub screen showed up inttially (till I booted to Windows boot manager) but when I booted into Windows boot manager I can't see ubuntu grub menu anymore so I am uable to boot to Ubuntu.

Your problem is mostly likely that you didn't install Windows and Ubuntu in the correct order or installed GRUB not properly. But one of these should solve your problem.\nBoot from the right partition\nGo into your BIOS/UEFI and pick the disk where you have installed GRUB. Sometimes when an error occurs the BIOS/UEFI will switch disks in order to boot.\nUpdate GRUB and make it show up during start up\nUse your USB Live Install to boot into your Ubuntu install. To do so pick your USB drive in your BIOS to boot from.\nTo make GRUB show up during startup, open /etc/default/grub with sudo. Comment out GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT=0 with a #.\nThen type into the terminal sudo update-grub. \nUse Boot-Repair to reinstall GRUB\nIf none of the above worked, this should work most certainly. Here is how to install Boot-Repair\nIn order for Boot-Repair to work you need to create an unformatted partition with >2MB (it will tell you) and set the bios_grub boot flag. You can do this with GParted. Simply make free space for the partition by making one of the existing smaller and then add a new unformatted partition with the flag. Boot-Repair will take it from here.\n", "Q: How to delete all OSes on a computer except for one I want a simple way to delete all Oses off my computer except for one, that being Ubuntu. I also want to put all the remaining unallocated space onto the Ubuntu partition, so that it may have the original storage space.\n\nA: Use gparted from the live CD.\nThe community wiki help contains some good explanations with examples about how to do it https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HowtoPartition/\nLast but not least, keep in mind that modifying partitions is a delicate task, so backing up your data before is always a good idea. \n\nA: You can use OS-Uninstaller.\nDownload Boot Repair Disk ISO file, and burn it to CD.\nOr \nTo install,  boot your computer with Ubunut live DVD or USB, and click on try Ubunutu.  Once booted, press Ctrl+Alt+T on your keyboard to open Terminal.

I am unable to log into my graphical environment, hence needing to use tty (I believe my desktop manager is not starting). What is going wrong?\n\nA: That's because you're probably typing the wrong username: remember that upon user's creation, if the full name provided it's two words long and it contains uppercases (e.g. \"John Smith\"), it will default to the first word converted to lowercase (i.e. \"john\").\nBefore switching to a tty, open a terminal within your graphic environment by hitting Ctrl+Alt+t and run the command whoami: this will return the exact username to be used upon tty login.\n\nSince you can't access your graphical environment, try the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shutdown the system\n\n*While booting, hold Shift to access grub2's menu\n\n*Select Advanced options for Ubuntu and hit Enter\n\n\n\n*Select your current kernel's recovery mode (e.g. Ubuntu 12.04 x.xx.xx-xx-generic (recovery mode)) and hit Enter\n\n\n\n*Select root - Drop to root shell prompt and hit Enter\n\n\n\n*Run cat /etc/passwd to see a list of all the users present in the system. Check your actual username\n\n*Run exit\n\n*Select resume - Resume normal boot\n\n*Try to login in a tty using the username recovered from the list\n\n\nA: the workaround is to append somewhere in your kernel cmdline while in grub the parameter init=/bin/bash or /bin/sh or zsh whatever you use. also change ro to rw otherwise you need to mount -o remount,rw /dev/sdx /. do not forget to # out whatever comes after this parameter or append it at the end otherwise it will read the output after as a command in shell.\n", "Q: How can I tell if my Ubuntu kernel leap second bug free?

For starters, I am extremely new to the ubuntu community and even with UNIX itself...\nI have managed to wipe an old gaming computer, stack it with some ram, install ubuntu desktop 14.04, and from following some guides get a minecraft server running locally.\nNow when I say locally, I can turn on the 'server', log onto the said server using putty and launch the minecraft platform through putty and then run around giving commands etc. through my PC.  This is great and all, but I have absolutely no idea how a friend outside of my LAN would be able to connect to the server.  \nI have a vague idea of how the minecraft platform and how remote connection works in the first place.  Does anyone know of a way to set up the server the way that I want in general i.e. put a game on the server, and have people connect to it remotely and locally?  Or at least could point me in the direction of what to even search for in google to do some self learnage?  \nThanks in advance!\n\nA: Connecting inside your LAN:\n\n\n*\n\n*Just type in the local IP, the one output from \"ifconfig\" or \"ip address\".\n\n\nTo have people outside your LAN connect:\n\n\n*\n\n*Forward a port to your game server's local IP address. In order to not have to adjust the forwarding all the time, you'll probably want to assign your game server a static IP address from your router.\n\n*Anyone outside your network can then connect by using your external IP* and that port that you forwarded to your game server. \n*Suggestion: Instead of having to tell everyone your new external IP every time it changes, you can use an online service to give it a name that updates automatically (like game.server.org, for example, but it will always resolve to your external IP). This is called dynamic DNS, you can search that if you're interested.\n", "Q: How can I remove memtest from boot menu I first installed Windows 8 and then Ubuntu. There was no Windows entry on the boot screen, so I did grub-update and now it is present, but I also have 2 additional memtest entries in the list.\nIs there a way to remove those from the list and have only Windows and Ubuntu there?\n\nA: If it's just the memtest options you don't want, you can simply remove that package:\nsudo apt-get remove memtest86+\n\nYou can also control the generation of the submenus (the \"Advanced options for ...\" entries), and the recovery options by editing /etc/default/grub. From the grub info documentation:\n\n'GRUB_DISABLE_RECOVERY'\n     If this option is set to 'true', disable the generation of recovery\n     mode menu entries.\n\nand\n\n'GRUB_DISABLE_SUBMENU'\n     Normally, 'grub-mkconfig' will generate top level menu entry for\n     the kernel with highest version number and put all other found\n     kernels or alternative menu entries for recovery mode in submenu.\n     For entries returned by 'os-prober' first entry will be put on top\n     level and all others in submenu.  If this option is set to 'y',\n     flat menu with all entries on top level will be generated instead.\n\nFor more details on the grub configuration, check out:\n info -f grub -n 'Simple configuration'\n\n\nA: I know the post is old, but it still comes up in  searches.\nsudo chmod -x /etc/grub.d/20_memtest86+\nsudo update-grub\n\nThis will hide it from grub by setting execution bit to off.

I have tried a lot most of the sites i have seen it supports till 12.04 ?\nAnd which music player is similar to Beatbox Music player ? Noise player ?\n\nA: The developer of Beatbox ended the software somewhere in 2013 due to a lack of time. The last release was \"saucy\" (13.10). If you want you can add the 13.10 PPA to your system by adding ...\ndeb http://ppa.launchpad.net/sgringwe/beatbox/ubuntu saucy main \ndeb-src http://ppa.launchpad.net/sgringwe/beatbox/ubuntu saucy main \n\nto your sources. And from command line of from Ubuntu software center you can install this older version. Command line: \nsudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get install beatbox.\n\nBut Noise Music Player is indeed the to go to music player if you want an alternative.

When I create a user i.e. \"test\" that user should have a home directory according to the subdomain test.itaportalen.dk with FTP access to only that folder (and subdirectories that user might create).\nMy questions are as follows:\nWhere do I place folder for subdomain test.itaportalen.dk so that the CNAME will point directly to that folder? I can not seem to make this work on UBUNTU and APACHE2\nI have chrooted my users so that they only see their homefolder (in this case a subdomain) what is the correct way to give them RW access so thay can upload files to their websites?\nI know this is pretty basic stuff but I can not seem to make it work on this UBUNTU installation.\n\nA: By default apache is setup for individual users to have their own URL, all you have to do is enable it:\nsudo a2enmod userdir\n\nThen say user test01 access would be via itaportalen.dk/~test01 and their directory would be /home/test01/public_html. However, I gather you don't want to do it that way.\nFor example, say the user names are test01, test02, test03, test04.\nAdd A records (or CNAME records, if you prefer) to your DNS zone file:\nepson-wp2       IN      A       192.168.111.111\ns15             IN      A       192.168.111.112\nbla             IN      A       192.168.111.112\ntest01          IN      A       192.168.111.112\ntest02          IN      A       192.168.111.112\ntest03          IN      A       192.168.111.112\ntest04          IN      A       192.168.111.112\ns16             IN      A       192.168.111.113\n\nAll pointing to the same IP address. In your case 5.196.14.205.\nThen in /etc/apache2/sites-availableyou will want to create 4 new files. Start by copying the default file:\nsudo cp 000-default.conf test01.conf\n\nEdit the new file like so:\n<VirtualHost *:80>\n    ServerName test01.smythies.com\n\n    ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost\n    DocumentRoot /var/www/html/test01\n\n    <Directory />\n            Options FollowSymLinks\n            AllowOverride None\n    </Directory>\n    <Directory /var/www/html/test01>\n            Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews Includes\n            AllowOverride All\n            ...\n\nWhere I have chosen to have each directory under /var/www/html. You do what you want. However, you might need to edit /etc/apache2/apache2.conf, depending on where you locate the directories.\nRepeat for the other users. Then enable each virtual host:\nsudo a2ensite test01\nsudo a2ensite test02\nsudo a2ensite test03\nsudo a2ensite test04\n\nRestart:\nsudo service apache2 restart\n\nI did this on my internal test server and it worked as expected.

Even though it has more than enough RAM and other specs to run Ubuntu 14.04, I typically suggest to friends that if they're finding a Linux solution for a computer designed to run XP, it's better to go with an older Ubuntu, lighter Ubuntu, or another Linux distro altogether.

The image renders fine when the Drawing Area fits inside the Scrolled Window. But when i request a size larger than the Scrolled Window then the Drawing Area is not always redrawn when I scroll up or down, and the same happens when the parent window is resized. What happens is that I get an area of the right size inside the Scrolled Window, but it looks as if there is no Drawing Area inside, or as if there is nothing drawn on the Drawing Area, which sometimes flashes with the correct drawing on random positions of the scrollbars. I have connected a callback to the draw signal that prints \" render\" every time it gets called, and another callback to the value-change signal of the adjustments of the scrollbars that print \"adj\" to screen whenever they get scrolled. The terminal output is as follows\nadj\nadj\nadj\nadj\nadj\n1428919598 render\nadj\nadj\nadj\n\nSo every time i see adj the canvas look blank, while it gets drawn correctly when i see <...> render.

It was developed by AMD (hence the name amd64) as an alternative to Intel's and HP's IA-64 architecture, as a means to add 64-bit computing capabilities to the existing x86 architecture.\nMost recent Intel and AMD processors (with the exception of Intel's Itanium line) utilise the x86_64 architecture, so do not be confused by the name.\n\nA: AMD64 packages are for 64-bit processors and i386 are for 32-bit. AMD64 and i386 refers to the architecture, not the manufacturer. \nTo answer the question \"Is it a problem to have packages with “amd64” architecture when I have an intel cpu?\" - no, it isn't. \nHowever, there may be some special cases when the amd64 package is known to have problems and the recommendation might be to install the i386 package instead. \n", "Q: Ubuntu Phone : Change the device name I want to change the default device name (\"bq Aquaris E4.5 Ubuntu Edition\") of my Ubuntu Phone .\nHow can I proceed?\n\nA: Bluetooth\nAt least for Bluetooth you can do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use adb\n\n\nTo use adb you must have developer mode enabled and adb installed (the sdk is enough, you don't need the entire IDE, which is Android specific anyway). If you have it installed you can follow these commands\n$ adb shell\nphablet@ubuntu-phablet:~$ sudo vi /etc/machine-info\n[sudo] password for phablet: {fill in your passphrase/PIN}\n\nNow you can enter the name you want after PRETTY_HOSTNAME\nPRETTY_HOSTNAME=\"Your preferred name here\"\n\nIn stead of vi you can also use nano (i.e.: \nphablet@ubuntu-phablet:~$ sudo nano /etc/machine-info\n\n)\nThere is lots of help available on how to use vi or nano\n\n\n*Use a terminal app\n\n\nIn the Ubuntu Store there is an app called Terminal. When installed, you can use it to type the same commands as for adb.\nSetting up adb is far more work, but I had it installed already and I prefer using a real keyboard over an on-screen keyboard for these kind of things.\nDevice Hostname\nYou can also change the device hostname, but it is doesn't work as well as changing the PRETTY_HOSTNAME setting. \nphablet@ubuntu-phablet:~% sudo hostname <new-hostname>\n\nNote that the actual hostname must be a valid hostname\nA (big) caveat with this is, that – apparently – /etc/ is not writeable by default, meaning that hostname will not update /etc/hosts since that file is not writeable. To be able to resolve its own hostname, the system needs /etc/hosts to contains a reference to its own hostname, otherwise you'll get error messages like \"unable to resolve host \", since /etc/hosts only contains references to ubuntu-phablet.\n", "Q: Ubuntu Phone--is there one that works in the Americas? I see that the Ubuntu Phone is now available, but I only see it on Ubuntu's site as for sale in Europe.  Does anyone know if there is an Ubuntu phone available for use in the Americas, specifically the US?  Does anyone know if the Ubuntu phones designed for Europe would work on US providers/work off US towers?  If it is possible to get an Ubuntu phone for use in the US right now, I would appreciate directions as to where to get it and what providers support it.\n\nA: There is no Ubuntu Phone for the US yet.  The BQ phone released in Europe will only be able to use 2G in the US, I believe.  So it might technically work, but not in a way you would find usable.\nCristian Parrino from Canonical said an announcement for the US market would happen before August.\n\nA: I'm on AT&T and located in Maryland.

I made a mistake changing the C keystroke into the numbersign, so every time I type C in keyboard, the display show numbersign instead. How can I change it back? \n\nA: You said that you changed it with xmodmap -e \"keycode 54 shift = numbersign asciitilde\".\nTo change this back, you can run\nxmodmap -e \"keycode 54 shift = c C\"\n\nSince you can't type \"c\" and \"C\", you can either copy-paste the command from here, or press Ctrl+Shift+U, then either \"63\" for lowercase \"c\", or \"43\" for uppercase \"C\", and finally Enter.\n", "Q: How to change 'Your Name'? I'm new to Ubuntu 14.10, and I want to change the 'your name' (appear at the time of Installation) from hanu to Hanu in Terminal, i.e., hanu@4268 to Hanu@4268.\n\nA: You can accomplish this using a case modification parameter expansion of $USER instead of \\u inside the PS1 environment variable. The expansion would be ${USER^} to uppercase only the first letter of the username).\nYou can run this variable assignment on the terminal to see the effect:\nPS1='\\[\\e]0;${USER^}@\\h: \\w\\a\\]${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}${USER^}@\\h:\\w\\$ '\n\n\nIf do you want to make this change permanent, you can use this method:\n\n\n*\n\n*Edit the .bashrc file in your home folder\n\n*Locate these lines:\nif [ \"$color_prompt\" = yes ]; then\n    PS1='${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}\\[\\033[01;32m\\]\\u@\\h\\[\\033[00m\\]:\\[\\033[01;34m\\]\\w\\[\\033[00m\\]\\$ '\nelse\n    PS1='${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}\\u@\\h:\\w\\$ '\nfi\n\n\n*In the two lines that begin with PS1=, replace \\u by ${USER^}, so it looks like this:\nif [ \"$color_prompt\" = yes ]; then\n    PS1='${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}\\[\\033[01;32m\\]${USER^}@\\h\\[\\033[00m\\]:\\[\\033[01;34m\\]\\w\\[\\033[00m\\]\\$ '\nelse\n    PS1='${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}${USER^}@\\h:\\w\\$ '\nfi\n\n", "Q: num lock messing up keys on right side of keyboard I am using ubuntu 14.04 on a HP Pavillion DV9700 laptop.\nThis use to work fine (for years)  I have had 14.04 running for at least 3-4 months.

Many people have reported the same thing happening in Windows with similar models of laptop.  See http://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Other-Notebook-PC-Questions/Problem-with-num-lock-and-keyboard/td-p/256, for example.\nPut simply, your keyboard firmware now wrongly thinks that it doesn't have a numberpad, and these keys can be used as a numberpad on keyboards without one.\n", "Q: Do I need to install a firewall, or is there already one active pre-installed? When I first touched linux, I installed Zorin. It's essentially an Ubuntu fork, but the desktop is redesigned to make it look like home to a person who has been using Windows for a long time. It came with a firewall pre-installed. A few months ago I decided that some answers to questions here were pretty incompatible with Zorin (especially using the dash, as it does not exist there). The installation was also generally pretty broken.\nI just noticed that Ubuntu doesn't seem to come with a firewall pre-installed. I am, unlike this one, pretty much a geek and I will likely have not much trouble setting it up. My question is, is it a better idea to install that firewall for this system, or leave it alone? Because it seems to not come with a firewall, but maybe there's one running in the background, where I cannot see it.\nThis question is also not exactly a duplicate of this one, that one doesn't know if they need one, I already know I need one, but I am not sure if I need to install one or if there's already one running in the background.\n\nA: No, there's no firewall pre-installed. It's only needed when you are opening up some ports to the outside internet, such as for hosting a server (especially for hosting webservers), using remote desktop, or things like that. Stuff like skype uses ports but it won't really create the need for a firewall.\nIf you need one: Ufw is a simple good firewall. You can install it with this command:\nsudo apt-get install ufw\n\nTo start it, run this one (make sure you ran the above command as well):\nsudo ufw enable\n\nIf you're not such a geek, but still want to have a firewall running, use this one instead,\nsudo apt-get install gufw\n\nThis will install ufw, and the graphical user interface (GUI) that you can control ufw with. You do not need to install ufw first if you install this.\nAfter that, you can start configuring ufw by running this command in a terminal:\ngufw\n\nTo start right away, just click the enable switch. You may want to add some firewall rules for programs that you use. Refer to the FAQ of any program that you think is waiting for incoming connections, at any time, even briefly. These are especially instant message (IM) programs, such as Skype, Steam, remote desktop servers, or things like that.\n", "Q: Stop blue LED flashing on BQ Ubuntu phone I have bluetooth turned off on my BQ 4.5 Ubuntu phone and the blue LED does not flash while using the phone, but when the phone goes into standby mode a blue LED keeps flashing below the top front speaker which is really annoying, especially when I am lying in bed trying to sleep (I usually just flip it round). Is there anyway I stop this from happening?\n\nA: Maybe you have some notifications waiting. The first indicator (in the left) in the upper side of the screen is an envelope. If you see it green, then you have notifications that you can clear (page 36 of the manual) and then, the blue LED will disappear. If the envelope is grey, you will find it empty and there will be another reason. \n", "Q: Make powersave governor permanent is there any option to make powersafe cpufreq governor permanent? Although i set default frequency to powersave, it automatically changes to other governor (in most cases \"ondemand\").\nThanks.\n\nA: During boot Ubuntu runs a script /etc/init.d/ondemand that waits one minute, then sets ondemand mode. You can make a change to that script such that it sets powersave mode instead.\nNote that doing so, and with the acpi-cpufreq driver, your CPUs will always be at the very minimum clock frequency.\n", "Q: Installing google chrome broke my Amazon Instant Video Player Ever since I installed Google Chrome my Amazon Instant Video Player only streams on the lowest bitrate. \nSomehow the pepper-flash messed with HAL in Firefox:\n\n\"Our developers stated this: It appears that Pepper Flash (bundled with Chrome) is conflicting with the standard NPAPI and ActiveX Flash plugins. To resolve this problem remove all Adobe Flash components/plugins and completely remove Chrome. After, reinstall Flash(latest version). Make sure that you still have Google Chrome off of the computer, since one of the root causes seem to be that Pepper Flash (bundled with Chrome) is causing this. You can now either use Firefox or IE, and update the flash on one of those browsers and see if that works. Another user with this issue used IE9 34 bit and 64 bit version both, and they both streamed at 2500 kbps BW in 720p. They were getting the good old 348 before that. They later reinstalled Chrome(which is preloaded with Flash) and the issue repeated itself and therefore the only option was to remove Chrome again.\"\n\nHere is the thread\nI tried everything: purging/reinstalling HAL, purging chrome, purging/reinstalling firefox.\nIf anyone has any suggestions I'd love to know.\n\nA: I can't offer a direct solution to your problem, but I hope this background information clarifies what's going on. \nIn September, 2015 Chrome plans to drop support entirely for NPAPI plugins, such as Amazon Video. NPAPI (the \"N\" stands for \"Netscape\") is an ancient standard that exposes sensitive browser structures and has been the source of many browser vulnerabilities. \nNPAPI support is disabled by default in Chrome  since April, 2015 (version 42). However, as a temporary workaround you can enable a flag. Here's how: \n\n\n*\n\n*Go to chrome://flags/#enable-npapi\n\n*Choose Enable.\n\n*At the bottom left of your screen, click Relaunch Now.\nYou can use this flag to run NPAPI plugins until Chrome version 45\nNetflix got with the program and implemented a new method of streaming that doesn't depend on NPAPI. On the other hand, Amazon is telling its (gullible?) customers to switch to a browser that supports NPAPI, without explaining the inherent risks. \nYou should still be able to view Amazon video under Chrome by using Flash. However, Flash supports only SD, not HD, streams. And, you should be able to view Netflix. If so, Chrome is doing all it can currently do. If either of these tests fails, there may be value in fiddling with your Chrome configuration.\n", "Q: \"Virtual Device\" for Microphone, Speakers, and Ringing I just installed Ubuntu 14.04 and and 4.3 Skype.

Not only would you have to reboot the same machine you're developing with (interrupting your work flow), but you might accidentally build a kernel that is missing some hardware drivers your laptop uses.\nIf you do that, you can hold down Shift during boot to get the grub menu and boot an official kernel instead of your custom one.  So you won't ruin anything.\nBut I'd recommend instead using a virtual machine like VirtualBox or kvm to boot your kernel inside a safe fake machine.\n\nA: You can always afford to experiment provided you begin with a good disaster recovery plan. muru suggestion (in comments) to use a virtual machine is likely the safest and perhaps easiest solution (to take that approach  see this and this ). \nHowever, provided you have current backups ( see this and this ) and a known good live media of your current system it's highly unlikely that you will lose anything other than a little time (even in the event of an epic failure)\nIf something kernel related goes wrong, you can always choose to boot your system with your previous version of the kernel from the Advanced Options in the GRUB menu.\nI've found experimentation to be one of the best ways to obtain experience and I recommend it whole-heartedly. \nsource: Experience\n", "Q: broken dependencies are not solved When i installed the \nsudo apt-get install dhcp3-server tftpd-hpa syslinux nfs-kernel-server initramfs-tools \n\nI got error. after that i wanted to fix the broken dependencies problem i tried\nashokkrishna@ashokkrishna-Lenovo-B560:~$ sudo apt-get install -f\nReading package lists...

IBus, which is enabled by default in Ubuntu, has some built-in compose table rules, but at the same time it seems to disable the functionality provided by libx11.\nFrom some sources it's said that ~/.XCompose is recognized together with uim. So a possible solution for you (untested) might be to install and enable the uim IM framework and start using uim-anthy instead of ibus-anthy.\nEdit:\nI was curious, so I tested. uim seems to work.

Anything built for \"-security\" is built on top of which ever version of a package is newest between \"-updates\" and \"-security\", so that nothing in \"-security\" will introduce bug regressions.\n\nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/SecurityTeam/FAQ#Repositories\nSo as the packages are built and tested they are going to go through a series of repositories starting with the private security ppa and moving into -security and then into the other repos.\nThe exact migration is going to vary with the severity of the security problem, testing, and what, if anything, may be needed in the other repositories, and eventually the packages are in -main once they are packaged by the -main maintainer.\nI am going to guess that the security team maintains ppa and -security and other packages or MOTU maintain -main or -universe with varying degrees of overlap in the maintainers depending on the package.\n", "Q: How to add user from guest user?

Since you have them mounted under /mnt, they are not shown.  Either manually change the fstab entries to mount them under /media, or remove the entries entirely and let the system automatically mount them there.\n\nA: That's because you have them mounted using fstab. If you want them to show up on the left hand side of nautilus, comment out or delete those lines from /etc/fstab and reboot.\nAfter you reboot, the partitions should appear on the left hand side and will be available under /media/<username> after you click on each partition to mount it.\n", "Q: need to switch DP daisy-chained monitors on & off to get xrandr to switch them on I'm running awesomewm on an Ubuntu laptop. I have two external monitors connected in DP daisy chain configuration, plugged into laptop's mini-dp port. xrandr detects both when they are plugged in. However, if I just plug in the mini-dp cable and run the xrandr command to switch off the laptop display and switch on the two monitors, the monitors do not switch on.\nIf I turn the monitors on and off a few times and then run the xrandr command, it works properly. I say \"on and off a few times\" because that's what I in fact do, although it's not clear what exactly I have to do to make them work.\nI'm guessing this has something to do with hardware power management in the monitors, but not totally sure. This has never happened when I, for example, ran two monitors directly from laptop outputs using different outputs (for example, one from HDMI, one from DVI, or one from HDMI, one from mini-dvi-to-hdmi).

I was playing around with alloc functions in my Ubuntu 14.04 64-bit, gcc version 4.8.2 (Ubuntu 4.8.2-19ubuntu1) and found that malloc returns memory with initializing it to zero. Which is quite weird as it should not initialize and the returned memory block should be uninitialized.\nThe code is as follows:\n#include<stdio.h>\n#include<stdlib.h> \nint main()\n{\n    int *i=(int*)malloc(4);\n    printf(\"The Address of pointer is %p and Value is %d\\n\",i,*i);\n    return 0;\n}\n\nOutput is:\nThe Address of pointer is 0x843070 and Value is 0  \n\nI have also tried with assigning big chunks of memory with the same result.\nCan anyone suggest why this is happening?\n\nA: malloc() allocates memory from the heap, which it manages.  It very well may return a chunk of heap that was previously used and then free()ed, and so it will still contain whatever data was there before.  When there is no heap yet, or not any free, it has to obtain more ram from the kernel to enlarge the heap.  When the kernel gives a new process more ram, it makes sure to zero it all out first, lest one process be able to capture and examine data freed by another process, which may contain sensitive information.  Thus, what you are likely seeing is the first time you malloc() any memory, it is coming straight from the kernel and is thus zeroeod, rather than being reused heap within the process, which would not be zeroed.\n", "Q: Laptop screen goes blank My laptop screen goes blank (everything else responsive otherwise) after a random number of seconds (of active use, not idle) of booting the OS.\nI've noted, everything is fine after fresh installation, going to the google.com/chrome link malfunctions it permanently. \nSame issue with Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, 14.04 LTS and Linux Mint 13.\nI've Intel Mobile 965 Express chipset.\nDo anyone know the fix?\nI don't know a lot of command-line, so please suggest an easy solution, if any at all.\n\nA: I've just had the same issue today, on a freshly installed 15.04.

Once at this menu make sure you select the usb/cd and choose to try Ubuntu 14.04.\nStep 5: In the trial version of ubuntu you will be logged into a temporary ubuntu session. Open up gparted, your computers hard drive should now be unmounted or at the least unmountable.\nYou should now be able to re-size your partition without any size restrictions, it may take a while to complete the task of resizing the partition depending on how much space you are trying to free up as well as how powerful your machine is. \nOh and whatever you do \nDO NOT UNPLUG THE USB OR EJECT THE CD, AND IF YOU CAN BACK UP YOUR MACHINE. \nIf the process is interrupted at all it can damage your version of Ubuntu and for you to have to re-install Ubuntu. Like i had to because i  was rushing. If you don't know how to back up Ubuntu there should be plenty of resources online that you can google (Ex Search: How to backup Ubuntu 14.04)\nHope this helps and hope its not confusing in anyway.

By \"cleanly\", I mean that it doesn't just simply kill all the instances at once, which is what I already have with this alias:\nalias poof='/usr/bin/killall gnome-terminal'    \n\nWhat I want to do is to make it behave as the Terminal application behaves in Mac OS X. On that platform, when I hit \"command-Q\" (a/k/a \"Apple-Q\") in Terminal, all the windows are closed, but if there are processes running in any particular Terminal window, I get a dialog box warning me and asking me if I still want to close the window. This way I can make sure I don't kill a process I forgot about (e.g. editing a file with vim). In other words, it acts as though I have clicked the close button on each window.\nThis question has been asked in one form or another before, it has not been answered satisfactorily (unless I misunderstood the answer).  Surely there is a way to do this in Ubuntu 14.04? Either in the command line or using a keyboard shortcut (or both)?\n(And please forgive me if I am not following any stylistic formats correctly, as I am new.)\n\nA: Even the \"friendliest\" kill- command will close the terminal without asking. Also man gnome-terminal does not give any solution to close the window like in the GUI.\nYou can however make a script raise (all) gnome-terminal windows and simulate Ctrl+Shift+Q.\nA complexity is that this will not work when the windows are spread over different workspaces.

You cannot have any system running without it.\nSee here for more info: \nWhat is kernel? \nWebopedia \nUbuntu is based on linux kernel. The latest Ubuntu 14.10 was released with Linux kernel 3.16 version.But just like other parts of the system the kernel gets updates from Canonical, too.  \nAn average user doesn't have to bother about kernel.

After using my wifes laptop I found out fglrx does something with the backlight.  Also I thought it might have something to do with me running 14.10 instead of 14.04.\nSince I really wanted the drivers to work (using garmin basecamp on windows vmware) I figured I had to reinstall (I am a noob) 14.04.\nSo after making a fresh install of 14.04 I sudo apt myself to the latest available fglrx drivers in the repo's just to find out that I booted a black screen again. Using my wifes laptop I found out that fglrx still(or also)has problems with the backlight in 14.04\nWith a torch and settings set to high contrast I could somewhat work my way through some stuff and one was that the fglrx drivers were working properly, I could even launch the catalyst control centre. Just to see everything was working perfect, except backlight.\nSo with a torch I worked myself through some webpages and solutions which all did not work.\nI sudo apt xbacklight – which installed fine – adjusting did not work.\nlooking at /sys/class/backlight/acpi_video0 i could see all brightness settings seems to be as they should be.(at least as i think they are allright)\nfurthermore I used this page as a reference :\nAfter installing fglrx on Ubuntu 14.04 there is no backlight (hd 5470). Is there any workaround?\nShort list of things on the page :\n\n*\n\n*Try adding acpi_backlight=legacy or acpi_backlight=vendor (not both) as a kernel parameter.

Which all lead me to thing there is actually nothing wrong with the settings. The backlight just does not come alive with the drivers installed/loaded.\nCreating the udev rule mention on this wiki did also not work for me (maybe I did something wrong , not sure if I had to udevstart before reboot)\nhttps://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/backlight\nBut that refers to arch linux not ubuntu ( allthough I tried some things from that wiki as well)\nLooking at the xorg.conf i notice that even with the removed fglrx drivers the screen should use fglrx drivers\n\nSection \"Device\"\nIdentifier  \"aticonfig-Device[0]-0\"\nDriver      \"fglrx\"\nBusID       \"PCI:1:0:0\"\n\nThis might be because i did not generate a new xorg.conf file after i purged the fglrx driver?\nSo, using dmesg > dmesg.txt i cannot really find a difference in using the fglrx driver or without using the fglrx driver\nBoth state\n\n[   21.231381] asus_laptop: Asus Laptop Support version 0.42\n[   21.232100] asus_laptop: BSTS called, 0x5800 returned\n[   21.232121] asus_laptop:    model detected\n[   21.232599] asus_laptop: Backlight controlled by ACPI video driver\n\nthere are lots of differences between the 2, but since i was looking for backlight issues this might be the most important lines?\n-Is there anybody who can help me out a little more, or give me a push in the right direction in solving the issue? (except using the ubuntu drivers)\n-is there an option that i need to know about with the fglrx drivers to enable the backlight?\n\nA: Older Asus laptops have the same problem on Windows 8.1. The solution there is:\n\ngo into Power Options, Edit Plan Settings of the active plan, set Change plan brightness to the maximum for both battery and plugged in. You can access the same setting under Change advanced power settings, Display, Display Brightness.\nYou can still control the brightness using the keyboard. The control panel setting seems decoupled from the keyboard setting (I am guessing it is a driver issue that is at the root of the problem).\n\nI haven't found a way to fix it on Ubuntu yet, but this might be a place to look.\n", "Q: How to check which processes are still active after a user session has logged out I am needing to do some debugging work, and as a part of that debugging work I need to know if there are any processes still running after a user session has logged out. And I need to specifically be able to also tell to which user those processes belong to. It would also be useful for me to be able to log the processes still active during as much of the shutdown process as possible.\nI have already tried for instance to log which processes are still active after a certain user session logs out by having an admin account active at the same time as another account, so that while the other account is logging out the admin account will be logging the process activity with:\ntop > ~/top.txt\n\nBut there were two problems with that, firstly it would not allow for me to tell anything about the processes which are active during the shutdown process (well as much of it as I could log before the logging process gets terminated), and secondly the output into the text file was unreadable for me because most lines looked something like this:\n\nAnd although I can pick this apart and by looking at an actual example of top running in my CLI, I can tell what some bits are, but it's really hard to tell with what I have got to do, plus I don't know at which points what happened, I don't know if one of the outputs in the file is before the log out, or after, or some point during, and it is just really hard to read.\nSo I am wondering if there is a way to better achieve what I am trying to achieve? And if anybody could give me any suggestions on maybe how I could improve my methods, or suggest some new methods. \nI was thinking about perhaps running a logging script as root automatically, but as well as it being a bit of a possible security risk, it would probably give me the same scrambled output as I got from top before.

But Ubuntu will not always load, but instead will freeze on a plain black screen with no cursor and I have to remove the battery and replace it after a few seconds. It will then go back to Windows and the screen will flash sometimes.\nI have managed to get onto Ubuntu once after rebooting the laptop 4 or 5 times.

In almost all cases, it's best to install Ubuntu in the same mode as Windows. Doing otherwise can create symptoms like those you describe. There have been a number of recent questions about this, but my Web search turned up this older one and not the newer ones. It's still valid, though.\n\n*Your firmware is broken. Some machines just don't like dual-booting Windows and Ubuntu. There are various workarounds to such problems. The least intrusive is to use bcdedit in Windows or bcfg in an EFI shell; but you may need to rename boot loader filenames. Again, Google is giving me older questions and answers, but two that I believe are still valid is this one and this one.\nIf you need more help, please post a link to the RESULTS.txt file generated by the Boot Info Script (in the boot-info-script in Ubuntu, IIRC).\n", "Q: 14.04 update hangs on bluez I am having trouble doing a software update on 14.04. \nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\n\nThe terminal hangs indefinitely after outputting:\nSetting up bluez (5.23-2ubuntu0trusty1) ...\n\nI have tried rebooting the machine, but any further updates are met with this message: \nE: dpkg was interrupted, you must manually run 'sudo dpkg --configure -a' to correct the problem. \n\nRunning:\nsudo dpkg --configure -a \n\nResults in the same problem:\nSetting up bluez (5.23-2ubuntu0trusty1) ...  \n\nIs there a known problem with bluez?

It says a hardware switch was disabling it but I already hit FN+F8 to unblock it that way to no avail. I then went to terminal and typed \"rfkill unblock all\" but nothing changed. I then put \"iwconfig\" into terminal and saw I had a wlan0 interface but it didn't work. I saw an eth0, l0, and wmx0 but it said \"no wireless extensions\".

I found the following to be useful, but it requires sudo:\n$ sudo netstat -tapen | grep ssh | awk '{ print $5}' | sed '/0.0.0.0\\|::/d'\n192.168.1.1:60119\n99.xxx.xxx.xxx:1213\n\nIs there a way to get the 99.xxx.xxx.xxx information without a call to sudo?\n(Answered! Question #1: How is it that piping to grep returns only the error?)\nQuestion #2: Are there workarounds for getting WAN information with netstat? or...\nQuestion #3: Are there better options for my goal?\n\nA: Answer to 1 & 2:\nThe warning is from netstat, not from grep and its about the PID/Program name column of the netstat output:\n$ netstat -tapen\n(Not all processes could be identified, non-owned process info\n will not be shown, you would have to be root to see it all.)\nActive Internet connections (servers and established)\nProto Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address           Foreign Address         State       User       Inode       PID/Program name\n\nUsing sudo:\n$ sudo netstat -tapen\nActive Internet connections (servers and established)\nProto Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address           Foreign Address         State       User       Inode       PID/Program name\n\nThe alert is self explanatory, you have to be root to view the process IDs and program names owned by other (all) users, otherwise you will only get the PID/names of programs owned by you although you will get the open socket listings for those processes. \nThe distinction is basically summed up by the following, from man netstat:\n   PID/Program name\n       Slash-separated pair of the process id (PID) and process name of\nthe process that owns the socket.  --program causes this column  to\nbe  included. You will also need superuser privileges to see this  \ninformation on sockets you don't own. This identification information is  \nnot yet available for IPX sockets.\n\nIn you case, the program sshd is owned by root, so without using sudo all the socket info will appear in the output, not the program name and PID. As a result while using grep on the result of netstat -taepn you are getting the warning. \nOn the other hand if you use sudo, the PID/program name will appear in the netstat -taepn output and you can use grep to find the output.\nThe following will make you more clear (check the last column(PID/Program name)):\n$ netstat -tapen\n                                                        PID/Program name\ntcp  0  0 0.0.0.0:22  0.0.0.0:* LISTEN  0   11088       -               \n\n$sudo netstat -taepn\ntcp  0  0 0.0.0.0:22  0.0.0.0:* LISTEN  0   11088       1002/sshd       \n\nIf you are running this from a client machine then you can just ignore it as the process in that case will be ssh (not sshd) and will be owned by you.\nAnswer to 3:\nThere are so many ways. I will add a few:\n$ sudo netstat -taepn | grep \"ssh\" | tr -s ' ' | cut -d' ' -f4 | head -1\n192.168.5.3:22\n\n$ sudo netstat -taepn | grep -Po \"\\b(\\d|\\.)+:22(?= .*ssh)\"\n192.168.5.3:22\n\n$ sudo netstat -taepn | sed -nr '/ssh/s/.* ([^:]+:22) .*/\\1/p'\n192.168.5.3:22\n\nEDIT: Without sudo:\n$ netstat -taepn 2>/dev/null | grep \":22 \" | tr -s ' ' | cut -d' ' -f4 | head -1\n192.168.5.3:22\n\n$ netstat -taepn 2>/dev/null | grep -Po \"\\b(\\d|\\.)+:22\\b\"\n192.168.5.3:22\n\n$ netstat -taepn 2>/dev/null | sed -nr '/:22 /s/.* ([^:]+:22) .*/\\1/p'\n192.168.5.3:22\n\nEDIT 2: \nIf you want to get the remote IP address connected to port 22 (ssh) of the server without using sudo, your best best would be to read the socket statistics via ss command and get the desired output from that.\n$ ss -ant | grep -Po \"(\\d|\\.)+:22\\s+\\K[^:]+\"\n192.168.6.4\n\n$ ss -ant | sed -nr 's/.*([0-9]|\\.)+:22 +([^:]+).*/\\2/p'\n192.168.6.4\n\n$ ss -ant | grep -e \"ESTAB\" | grep \":22\" | tr -s ' ' | cut -d' ' -f5 | cut -d':' -f1\n192.168.6.4\n\nWe have run the above commands in the server and 192.168.6.4 is the IP address of the remote computer connected to the server via ssh on port 22.\n\nA: You can use the SSH_CONNECTION and SSH_CLIENT variables:\n$ echo $SSH_CONNECTION \n10.0.0.1 42276 10.0.0.2 22\n$ echo $SSH_CLIENT    \n10.0.0.1 42276 22\n$ SSH_IP=${SSH_CONNECTION%% *}\n$ echo $SSH_IP\n10.0.0.1\n\nFrom man 1 ssh:\n SSH_CONNECTION        Identifies the client and server ends of the\n                       connection.  The variable contains four space-\n                       separated values: client IP address, client port\n                       number, server IP address, and server port number.\n\nYou can access each entry in SSH_CONNECTION more easily if you split it into a bash array:\nssh_details=($SSH_CONNECTION)\n\nThen you can get each entry using its index:\n$ echo $SSH_CONNECTION \n127.0.0.1 55719 127.0.0.1 22\n$ ssh_details=($SSH_CONNECTION)\n$ echo ${ssh_details[0]}\n127.0.0.1\n$ echo ${ssh_details[1]}\n55719\n$ printf \"You are logging in from host IP %s from port # %d\\n\" ${ssh_details[0]} ${ssh_details[1]}\nYou are logging in from host IP 127.0.0.1 from port # 55719\n\nFor some reason, SSH_CLIENT is not documented in the English manpages.\n\nA: The line is bellogs to error output, i.e. sterr. You could get rid of it with\nnetstat -tapen 2> /dev/null | grep ssh\nFor reference check this\n\nAs properly noted by heemayl , without sudo, netstat won't report that connection is established by the ssh server, only if it's established by ssh client. \nOf course, you can still determine it by port number or using who -a utility, which will show logins and address, but it's not a guarantee somebody isn't logged in via telnet or remote desktop application.\n\nA: Before reading on to read the SSH_CLIENT answer (it was that simple you know), you could also do:\npid=$(ps -xh -o pid,cmd | grep [s]shd | awk '{print $1}' | head -1) \ncat /proc/$pid/net/tcp | while read a b c d e; do echo $b $c $d; done |\n    tail -n +2 | grep \" 01\" | while read a b c; do echo $b; done |\n    cut -d: -f1 | sed \"s/../& /g\" | while read d c b a; do\n    printf \"%d.%d.%d.%d\\n\" 0x$a 0x$b 0x$c 0x$d; done\n\nActually the process contains the connections for all clients, not just your own. It is basically the main SSHD process. I don't know why it runs under your user.\n", "Q: Problem while installing oracle-java8-installer I am trying to install Oracle's Java8, but I get the following errors.

I'm trying to install wmp10 through Wine so I can use the digital library accessing programme Overdrive. (Installing wmp10 through PlayOnLinux doesn't enable the DRM that allows Overdrive to work, hence the need to install it through Wine. Also, wmp isn't available through the GUI version of Winetricks that I have.) \nApparently I need to create a \"clean wineprefix\" first, but I don't know how to do that. Running the following code didn't work:\nWINEPREFIX=~/.wine.tmp wineprefixcreate\n\nCan someone give some very simple instructions showing how to make a clean wineprefix? And how to then install wmp10 from within the new prefix?\nUbuntu 14.04, XFCE interface, Wine 1.7.38, 32-bit\nThank you\n\nA: If you plan on having more than one alternative prefix, I'd recommend keeping a directory of prefixes (e.g., ~/.wine/wineprefix/<nameofprefix>). In your case of only needing one prefix, let's call our alternative wineprefix \".wine-w-wmp\":\nmkdir ~/.wine-w-wmp\nWINEPREFIX=~/.wine-w-wmp wine winecfg\n\nThe wineprefix part tells the wine program which virtual drive to use. wine winecfg is the actual command, which will bring up the virtual drive's configuration. However, winecfg will notice that no virtual drive exists at this new location and will create one. Wine \"bottles\"/\"wineprefixes\" and \"virtual drives\" are used interchangeably--they refer to a new instance of wine, like separate computers with their own setup. So this is your clean wineprefix.\n\nIn your case, to install Windows Media Player 10, download it from their website, and if the file is in your Downloads folder, run:\nWINEPREFIX=~/.wine-w-wmp wine ~/Downloads/MP10Setup.exe\n\nThen install as usual.\n\nIf you're planning to type WINEPREFIX=<directory of prefix> at the start of each wine command, you might want to just set that wineprefix as the default. (When run without \"WINEPREFIX=\", wine looks to its default wineprefix at ~/.wine.) To change the default (at least until your next restart), run:\nexport WINEPREFIX=~/.wine-w-wmp <or the directory of your prefix>\n\n(If you want this command to stick between new Terminal instances, add the above line to your ~/.bashrc and then run source ~/.bashrc to reload the file in your current instance.)\n\nA: To create a wineprefix called wineprefix, the command I used was:\nWINEPREFIX=/home/[name]/wineprefix winetricks dotnet40 corefonts\nI was given guidance about this at https://forum.winehq.org. Instructions are available under the FAQ section there: http://wiki.winehq.org/FAQ#32_bit_wineprefix.\n", "Q: How to format a drive with Ubuntu on it Is it possible to format a drive with Ubuntu on it. I've tried the gpart way and I could only get the format option for the small partition, leaving the large main partition intact. After that I could not get back in. Can I get a pdf file explaining it.\n\nA: You can't format a drive which contains the operating system doing the formatting, otherwise it would erase itself. \nAs @thomasrutter said, understand that formatting will wipe out EVERYTHING on that partition.\nThe easiest way to do it is to make a bootable Ubuntu on USB stick or CD, Ubuntu includes startup disk creator for that. When you boot your POST screen should say something along the lines press F2 or F12 for setup, Press F10 or DEL for boot order. Go to Boot Order, select the USB stick and boot into it, at the menu select Try without Installing, which will load an Ubuntu Live USB. At that point you can use GParted or Disks to erase anything your heart pleases\n\nA: If you are planning to remove Ubuntu and install another OS over it, you should backup any important files/folders before you do anything with partitions. \nNow that you've backed up all of your important things, insert the new OS disc/USB stick into your computer. Make sure you have the correct boot order set up. Then, when prompted about partitioning, select something that goes along these lines: \"Erase Ubuntu [14.10] LTS and install [Windows 8] over it\". This should remove Ubuntu easily.\nIf you are not planning to install another OS, try looking through your boot options to see if there is a partition manager of some sort and use that.\nAlso, I believe you can simply search \"Uninstall Ubuntu\" through the main menu, and you might be able to find something there as well.\n", "Q: Why won't XScreensaver install from the command line?

If so, how, and what steps should I take? I recently enabled ssh access to my machine to work on a group project with my classmates. I read the guide for setting up ssh on ubuntu and tried to follow good security practices. I disabled password authentication, so the only way to get in was with RSA keys, and I only had 2 keys listed in the authorized_keys file: my own (used it while testing to see if ssh was working properly) and a friends. \nThis evening I was curious to see if my friend was ssh'd into my system while I was using it, so I googled for a command that would tell me if anyone was ssh'd in, and if so, who. The result I got was:\nsudo netstat -tnpa | grep ESTABLISHED.*sshd\n\nI tried it, and the output was:\ntcp        0      0 192.168.1.86:22         59.47.0.150:44728       ESTABLISHED 7416/sshd: [accepte\n\nThat didn't look right. I contacted my friend and he assured me he wasn't logged in. I tried the command again, and saw:\ntcp        0      0 192.168.1.86:22         59.47.0.150:44728       ESTABLISHED 7416/sshd: root [pr\n\nAt this point I was a little freaked out by the word \"root\" and messaged a friend who knew more about this stuff than I did. He told me to try:\n ps aux | grep ssh\n\nwhich outputted:\nroot      3702  0.0  0.0  61364  2872 ?        Ss   Apr12   0:00 /usr/sbin/sshd -D\nroot      7473  0.0  0.0 112692  3920 ?

Even though it only accepted RSA key authorization?\n\nIt is unlikely they were authenticated, unless they managed to obtain a valid key.  Try connecting from a host you control without a key and check the running processes.  They should be similar to what you saw.  The fact the [net] process is running as sshd indicates that they have not succeeded in logging in.\n\nCan we say with certainty that he/she got root too? In my ssh-config, I had the default PermitRootLogin without-password. I originally thought this meant that root login wasn't permitted (I know the two sound contradictory, but I had googled it and that was the result I got)\n\nThe option you used permits logins to root, but disables password authentication for root.  It is good practice not to allow any root logins via SSH unless you really need them.  If you do restrict access as tightly as you can.  Unless you have enabled a key, it is unlikely you can login to root using SSH.  The without-password disables password based logins, but does not disable the password authentication method.  \n\nIf so, how?\n\nYou can check the auth log to see if any authentications succeeded.  However, if they did succeed they may have overwritten the evidence. \n\nIs there any way I can see what damage has been done so far?\n\nRunning a rootkit checker and verifying file signatures offline should indicate if any files were compromised.  Taking file signatures and storing them offline while you are secure will give you a baseline.\n\nHow can I safeguard against this in the future? I still need to have ssh running eventually to complete my group project.\n\nsshd supports use of tcpwrappers to restrict access.  Build a rule set that only allows access from address ranges that you expect traffic from.\n\nA: Lots of ssh brute force attacks taking place.  It is possible you have an obsolete ssh package and they got in that way. \nCheck for ssh failures in the logs, he maybe simply doing a brute force against you. \ngo to /tmp and post its output from ls -al, if there is a root kit it might show up there. \nYou can set allow users in ssh and fail2ban is useful as well.\nSet /tmp and /home as non-executable in fstab if possible will help a lot.\n\nA: If it is only a brute force attack filling up logs, simply change the port. \nMost scripts are stupid and there are enough servers which listen to port 22.

I've been encountering this problem for years. I keep having to switch to the Main Server because the one for Pakistan is too outdated to even complete an apt-get update\nWhere is the right place to report this?\n\nA: The repositories of Ubuntu are owned by third parties and hence it is their responsibility to update the servers on time.\nAs the server you are using is not always updated, you should consider using other servers. The main server works very well in the Indian subcontinent. Otherwise you may use the Nayatel pvt. ltd server which is located in Pakistan.\nThere would be no use of reporting this as a bug on launchpad, as it is not a bug. You may contact the repo owner if you wish.\n\nA: There are country mirror requirements that unfortunately are still not being followed in Pakistan. You can report these violations by sending an email to mirrors@ubuntu.com. I did that last year and they disabled default pk mirror pk.archive.ubuntu.com pointer to outdated Nayatel's Mirror.

It is imperative that your RAID settings be identical in the firmware and in all your OSes!!! If I'm right and you simply \"fix\" the problem in Ubuntu but leave RAID enabled in your firmware and/or in Windows, you could conceivably end up with data loss. Note that RAID can be active even on single-disk setups, although it's useless with just one disk.\nOne way to check this is to run the Windows version of gdisk (binaries available here, although you'll have to dig down to the current version's gdisk-binaries subdirectory). Run gdisk in Windows and type v. This runs a disk check. If my hypothesis is correct, gdisk will complain about a damaged backup partition table, but the same check using gdisk in Ubuntu will make no such complaint.\n", "Q: Restore lost keyboard shortcut I lost my shortkeys Ctrl+Super+⇐ and Ctrl+Super+⇒ for juxtaposing my windows:  how can I retrieve them?\nI have installed Unity Tweak Tool, which made my Ubuntu freeze many times (with the snap option), but these keyboard shortcuts aren't specified. \nIdeally I would like to edit the file where these shortcuts are defined.\nI use Ubuntu 14.04.\n\nA: I found a solution : install CompizConfig, section window manager, and check grid box.\n\nA: These shortcuts are present in \"Keyboard\" option in \"System Settings\" or you may search for \"keyboard\" in \"dash\".

But nevertheless, I will also be glad to know about a working solution that requires the source encoding to be provided.\nIf someone needs a test-case to examine different solutions, the above example is accessible via this link.\n\nA: The working solution I found is using the Microsoft Visual Studio Code text editor which is Freeware and available for Linux.\nOpen the file you want to convert its encoding in VS-Code. At the bottom of the window, there are a few buttons. One of them is related to the file encoding, as shown below:\n\nClicking this button pops up an overhead menu which includes two items. From this menu select the \"Reopen with Encoding\" option, just like below:\n\nThis will open another menu which includes a list of different encoding, as shown below. Now select \"Arabic (Windows 1256)\":\n\nThis will fix the gibberish text like this:\n\nNow click the encoding button again and this time select the \"Save with Encoding\" option, just as below:\n\nAnd in the new menu select the \"UTF-8\" option:\n\nThis will save the corrected file using the UTF-8 encoding:\n\nDone!  :)\n\nA: I don't know if this works with Farsi: I use Gedit, it gives a fault with wrong encoding, and I can chose what I want to translate to UTF-8, it was just text not lit format, but here is a screenshot!\n\nSorry I finally got through my text files, so now they are all converted.\nI loved notepad++ too, miss it still.\n\nA: Apart from iconv, which is a very useful tool either on its own or in a script, there is a really simple solution I found trying to figure out same problem for Greek charsets (Windows-1253 + ISO-8859-7). \nAll you need to do is to open the text file through Gedit's \"Open\" dialog and not by double-clicking it. At the bottom of the dialog box there is a drop-down for Encoding, which is set to \"Automatically Detected\". Change it to \"Windows-125x\" or other suitable codeset and the text will be perfectly readable in Gedit. You can then save it using UTF-8 encoding, just to be sure you won't have the same issue again in the future...\n\nA: These Windows files with Persian text are encoded in Windows-1256. So it can be deciphered by command similar to OP tried, but with different charsets. Namely:\nrecode Windows-1256..UTF-8 <Windows_file.txt > UTF8_file.txt\n(denounced upon original poster’s complaints; see comments)\niconv -f Windows-1256 Windows_file.txt > UTF8_file.txt\n\nThis one assumes that the LANG environment variable is set to a UTF-8 locale. To convert to any encoding (UTF-8 or otherwise), regardless of the current locale, one can say:\niconv -f Windows-1256 Windows_file.txt -t ${output_encoding} > ${output_file}\n\nOriginal poster is also confused with semantic of text recoding tools (recode, iconv). For source encoding (source.. or -f) one must specify encoding with which the file is saved (by the program that created it). Not some (naïve) guesses based on mojibake characters in programs that try (but fail) to read it. Trying either ISO-8859-15 or WINDOWS-1252 for a Persian text was obviously an impasse: these encodings merely do not contain any Persian letter.\n\nA: As a complementary solution to the problem, I have prepared a useful Bash script based on the iconv command from Incnis Mrsi's answer:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nif [ $# -lt 1 ]\nthen\n   echo 'Specify at least one file to fix.'\n   exit 1\nfi\n\n# Temp file to store conversion attempt(s).\ntmp='tmp.fixed'\n\nfor file in \"$@\"\ndo\n  # Try to fix the file encoding.\n  if iconv -f WINDOWS-1256 \"$file\" -t UTF-8 > $tmp; then\n    echo \"Fixed: '$file'\"\n    cat $tmp > \"$file\"\n  else\n    echo \"Failed to fix: '$file'\"\n  fi\ndone\nrm $tmp\n\nSave this script as fix-encoding.sh, give it execute permission using chmod +x fix-encoding.sh and use it like this:\n./fix-encoding.sh myfile.txt my2ndfile.srt my3rdfile.sub\n\nThis script will try to fix the encoding of any number of files it is provided as input. Note that the files will be fixed in-place, so the contents will be overwritten.\n\nA: If you like working in GUI instead of CLI, like I do:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open file with Geany (editor)\n\n*Go to File menu -> Reload as\n\n*Choose the assumed encoding to change the gibberish into identifiable characters in your language. For example, to read Greek subs I would reload as West European -> Greek (Windows-1253)\n\n*Go to Document menu > Set Encoding -> Unicode -> UTF-8\n\n*Save\n\n\nA: You can use Vim to do the encoding conversion:\nvim '+set fileencoding=utf-8' '+wq' file.txt\n\nBut this depends on Vim detecting the original encoding correctly. To make it use the correct one if it doesn't, you can do something like:\nvim '+e ++enc=cp1256 file.txt | set fileencoding=utf-8 | wq'\n\nOr, to save to a different file instead of doing it in place:\nvim '+e ++enc=cp1256 file.txt | w ++enc=utf-8 file-utf.txt | q'\n\n\nA: I figured out it in manjaro with gaupol and work perfect but you must do it one by one and don't have batch mode\nhttps://github.com/otsaloma/gaupol\nhttps://pkgs.org/download/gaupol\nJust open a file (no matter source encoding)\nSave As (Shift + Ctrl + S)\nIn opened window, change Encoding to UTF-8\nHit Save and finished\n", "Q: How to protect essential Windows files on NTFS partition from edit/deletion in Ubuntu? So I made a mistake yesterday, accidentally deleting essential Windows files when working in Ubuntu (namely NTUSER.DAT).\nJust quickly my system set-up: I have Windows 7 (NTFS partition) and Ubuntu (Ext4 partition) dual boot, with all my documents, pictures, etc in Windows. Normal usage for me is working in Ubuntu with files on the Windows partition. (reason for this set-up: Ubuntu can read NTFS while Windows cannot read Ext4, and I need Windows for e.g. Photoshop)\nNow, I want to protect myself from making another stupid mistake in future. I want to protect specific essential Windows files, located on the NTFS partition, from editing when working in Ubuntu (installed on Ext4 partition).\nI read the following on StackExchange security:\n\nThe file and folder/directory permissions on an operating system are\n  managed and enforced by... you guessed it right, that operating system\n  (OS). When the operating system is taken out of the picture (booting a\n  different operating system), then those permissions become\n  meaningless.\nOne way to think of it: You hire a big bodyguard (OS) to protect your\n  house. You give him a list (permissions) of the allowed guests (users)\n  and which areas (files and folders) they're allowed to visit. How\n  useful are those lists when the bodyguard is asleep (not booting from\n  that OS)?\n\nGiven the above, is it possible to protect myself? If so, how? Note that I'm just talking about protection in my own, current Ubuntu installation, not from new installations or live CDs.\n\nA: You can \"remove\" from yourself the temptation of modifying Windows files by hiding them via .hidden files.\nJust place a file with name .hidden in the directory where the files you want to protect are located and put a file or directory name in each line. These files will be hidden from file managers (except dolphin I think) and the terminal (unless you put the -a flag).\nFor example to hide the Windows and Program Files directories:\ncd <win_partition>\ngedit .hidden\n\nWrite Windows in the first line and Program Files in the second line. Feel free to complete the list with all the files you want to \"protect\".\nEdit: Keep in mind that this does not \"protect\" the files from being matched by bash auto completion. For example, rm -rf * in the Windows partition is still catastrophic.\n\nA: I would suggest a slightly different approach.  Create a separate partition in Windows (e.g. drive D:) and store all of your data files (e.g. documents, pictures, etc.) in that partition.  Mount the data partition in Ubuntu but do not mount the main Windows partition.  Now, all your data files will be accessible to both operating systems, but Ubuntu won't be able to see any of the Windows files relating to the OS and the apps.  This strategy also makes backup of the data files very easy.\n", "Q: Moving locked partitions I have Windows and Ubuntu systems on my laptop. I need to expand Linux partition. Since I can expand partitions to the bottom space I need to move sda3 to unallocated space and then expand Linux partitions in freed space. I have booted from live USB and found that I can only copy ext4 partition sda3 and sda6 copy menu is inactive. I see key picture near both of these partitions probably that is why I can't copy them? What is this key means and how to solve my problem with expanding partition?\n\n\nA: The key appears because the swap partition is mounted when using the live USB.  It appears on two partitions because swap is a 'subpartition' of an extended partition.\nYou can turn swap off with sudo swapoff -a and this will unlock the partitions.\n\nA: Boot from live media.\nRight click the unallocated space and delete it. It will become free space, then move your extended partition /dev/sda3 to the free space. Now there will be free space available after extended partition.Also delete the swap partition. Now extend your primary partition /dev/sda5 to as much space as you wish. Then create a new swap partition of 2 GB after /dev/sda5.\n", "Q: How to install ubuntu on an old mac-mini I've got an old mac mini A1103, without airport, running on Mac OSX 10.5.8\nI decided to install Ubuntu but I can't. Could anyone help me?\nWhich is the proper version for my mac?\nmy system:\n1.25 Ghz PowerPC G4\n512 Mb DDR SDRAM\n37 Gb hard drive\n\nA: Try Xubuntu 12.04\nThe problem: booting with the CD gives bad graphics or a blank screen.\nThe solution: when booting, hold down alt. Select the “Windows” CD, not the “EFI” CD. This will get you to a blankish purple screen with a fuzzy icon of a keyboard on the bottom. Press F6 (NB: this will not work with an Apple Wireless keyboard. Use a wired keyboard). Pick a language. Press the down key to select “Install Ubuntu“. Now press F6 again, and select nomodeset by using the arrow keys and the space bar. Press escape, and the menu should close. Towards the bottom of the screen there’s a boot line and a cursor… use the arrow keys to scroll left until you’re just left of “quiet” and “splash” (actually, you can delete those words). Type “nomodeset xforcevesa“. Press enter to boot. Wait. Keep waiting. Nothing’s happening? Keep waiting. It took about 5 minutes for my Mac Mini to move on, upon which it started whirring and clicking. Hurray!\nPost-install: your system won’t boot, unless you edit the boot commands at grub. Add nomodeset xforcevesa again (press ‘e’ when you’re at grub to edit a boot command). Once it boots, install the NVIDIA proprietary drivers. Edit /etc/default/grub to add nomodeset noacpi reboot=acpi in the appropriate place. Save the file, then run update-grub. Reboot. Your graphics may still suck. Run nvidia-xconfig and reboot.\ngood luck\nSources: dustin.li\n", "Q: Problem with same hostname and domain When I was setting up my production server the hostname was same as the name of one domain that wasn't planned to be used, but now I have to use this domain name and files are stored in /var/www directory (root directory) and I have trouble with permissions. \nI was thinking about changing the hostname of the server to another one and creating a new domain through ispconfig (/var/www/client#/domain).

What can I do to get the package to be found?\n\nA: The Dockerfile of the base image has the following instruction:\nrm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*\n\nThis clears the package lists downloaded by apt-get update. That's why you get the error. To solve this problem, execute apt-get update again in your Dockerfile.\n\nA: Make sure you bundle your update and install commands. See the official Docker docs on the matter. Docker has various issues with cache layer invalidation that can throw errors otherwise.\nRUN apt-get update && apt-get install postgresql-plpython-$PG_MAJOR=$PG_VERSION\n\nYou can also silence install output, and clean up apt caches to minimize your image and cache size. \nRUN apt-get update -qqy \\\n && apt-get install -qqy \\\n postgresql-plpython-$PG_MAJOR=$PG_VERSION \\\n && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/* /var/cache/apt/*\n\n", "Q: Missing characters after update ubuntu 14.04 today i have installed on my new Lenovo L450 ubunut 14.04, everything was fine.. after update i rebooted the PC and characters are missing in GTK apps (netbeans, unity is ok, anything else is wrong) for example instead of \"Extract here\" i have \" x r t  er \"\nI have tried to rollback from grub to prev. kernel. does not helped.\nThankyou\n\nA: I had the same problem with my X1 carbon and it appears I've solved it.

I presume this is the default python as this is the version the command \"which python\" gives me in terminal. I am running a python script in another program that defaults to python 2.4. I have two questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I install numpy on the non default version of Python, in my case python2.4. I have consulted the forums and could not find an answer. \n\n*Can I force another program to run a specfic version of Python when running a python script. From sys.version I can see which python its running, however is there another command I can use to enforce a specific version to run.\nThanks \n\nThanks Don.Joey,\nYes, I have looked at virtual environments and it is the correct way to do this. I understand it will work in the terminal,  however will this work when another program is calling the Python script? \nCheers \n\nA: What you are looking for are virtual environments. They allow you to have different version of a package. They also make it possible to have several versions of python live together.\nMake a virtual environment that uses 2.4. Install numpy in it. Run your script in that venv (virtual environment).

I have delved into the FilePermissions Wiki - https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FilePermissions\nRecently I installed an ecommerce open source software on my LAMP server.

The MAIN REASON I am posting this question is because now it has locked some of my folders How do I revert all those permissions back to normal? How would I know which folders' permission it has changed and what were their normal permissions?

As far as I know, hard links will not break when a file is deleted. Because the file will remain to exist. \nBut what happens when you mount a file system to /mnt for example, create a hard link to a file on that volume, unmount the volume, and then try to open the hard link?\n\nA: You cannot create hardlinks across mount boundaries.  You'll get something like:\nln: failed to create hard link ‘X’ => ‘Y’: Invalid cross-device link\n\n\nA: Yes, hard links will not break when a file is deleted. Because the file will remain to exist.\nBut a hard link to a file on a different file system is not possible, in a fundamental way.\nPractically, that means you can not create hard links to files on different file systems, and get an error when trying. \nNow, why is it not possible?\nA hard link is what you normally call a file. When there is a file system mounted in /mnt, and you see /mnt/example.txt, you see the name of the hard link example.txt on the  file system in /mnt, that points to the data of thee file.\nA file system contains file data and file names to access parts of the data. There is a reference from the name to the data. This reference is a hard link.\nCreating a hard link means to create a reference to the same file data with a new name.\nSo a hard link is a central part of a file system, referencing the data. That means that a hard link to a different file system is not possible - because it is a different file system. \nIn principle, there could be a file system that spans more than one partition, and enlarges when adding /mnt to it. Then a hard link to a different partition, but in the same file system could be created, and would break when the partition with the data is unmounted. \nWith this reasons, it's not only that a hard link to a different file system can not be created, but that it can not even exist by definition.strong text\n", "Q: Different applications, different sound output devices I would find it really useful if I could make it so that music I am playing on YouTube in Chrome comes out of speakers, and the sound from other applications comes out of my earphones, so I am wondering if there is a way to get it so that different applications use different sound devices to output?

I am using Ubuntu 12.04 as a repo and would like to view a progress bar when using rsync from the command line.  I tried the option suggested in this article (-P), but I prefer to see a progress bar and not use Grsync. I am using rsync -P source dest currently.\n\nA: rsync has a --info option that can be used to not only output the current progress, but also the transfer rate and elapsed time:\n--info=FLAGS            fine-grained informational verbosity\n\nThe explanation of how to use it comes under the -P option in the man page:\n-P     The -P option is equivalent to --partial --progress.  Its purpose is to\n       make it much easier to specify these two options for a long transfer that\n       may be interrupted.\n\n       There is also a --info=progress2 option that outputs statistics based on\n       the whole transfer, rather than individual files.  Use this flag\n       without  out‐putting  a  filename  (e.g. avoid -v or specify --info=name0)\n       if you want to see how the transfer is doing without scrolling the screen \n       with  a  lot  of names.   (You  don’t  need  to specify the --progress\n       option in order to use --info=progress2.)\n\nSo the following:\nrsync -r --info=progress2 --info=name0 \"$src\" \"$dst\"\n\nResults in the following being output and continuously updated:\n18,757,542,664 100%   65.70MB/s    0:04:32 (xfr#1389, to-chk=0/1510)\n\nNote that when the transfer starts the total number of chunks, and therefore the current progress, can change when the recursive option is used as more files are discovered for syncing\n\nA: You can use --progress and --stats parameters.\n$ rsync -avzh --progress --stats root@server:/path/to/file output_name\n\nroot@server's password: \nreceiving incremental file list\nfile\n         98.19M  54%    8.99MB/s    0:00:08\n\nFrom man page/explainshell:\n-a, --archive\n-v, --verbose\n-z, --compress\n-h, --human-readable\n\n--progress  This  option  tells  rsync to print information showing\n the progress of the transfer. This gives a bored user something to\n watch.  Implies --verbose if it wasn’t already specified.\n\n--stats  This  tells  rsync to print a verbose set of statistics on\n the file transfer, allowing you to tell how effective rsync’s\n delta-transfer algorithm is for your data.\n\n\nA: If your version of rsync does not accept the --info=progress2 option, you can use tqdm:\nTo install:\npip install tqdm\n\nTo use:\n\n$ rsync -av /source /dest | tqdm --unit_scale | wc -l\n10.0Mit [00:02, 3.58Mit/s]\n\n\nA: This finally worked:\nrsync \"$rsync_param\" -a --prune-empty-dirs --exclude \"*.iso\" rsync://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/indices/ /repo/ubuntu/indices | pv -lep -s $(rsync \"$rsync_param\"n rsync://archive.ubuntu.com/indices/ /repo/ubuntu/indices | awk 'NF' | wc -l)\n\n\nA: Yeah, do what Jon said: use the --info=progress2 option. But, what do I do if my version of rsync is too old and doesn't support this option? Answer: upgrade rsync!\nHere's how to build rsync from source on Ubuntu\n(tested on Ubuntu 16.04)\n\n*\n\n*Download latest version of rsync: https://download.samba.org/pub/rsync/src/.

You will have to install them from within Steam, as they are Steam games.\n\nA: If you install a game on PlayOnLinux through their list which requires steam. Then it will run the script for installation of that game, install steam for you (windows version), and then the PlayOnLinux script will wait for you to install that game in steam. Afterwards, you will close steam and the script will continue installing the additional files that you need for the game to work.

Second is for persistence and it should be ext4 with label casper-rw.\n\n*Copy files from your ISO (including hidden) to USB FAT32 partition.\n\n*Edit boot/grub/grub.cfg and just add the word persistent (This is the reason why persistence doesn't work for you in UEFI mode.):\n\n\n\nmenuentry \"Start Kubuntu\" {\n          set gfxpayload=keep\n          linux   /casper/vmlinuz.efipersistentfile=/cdrom/preseed/kubuntu.seed boot=casper maybe-ubiquity quiet splash --\n          initrd  /casper/initrd.lz\n      }\n\nIt might be a little slow when you first start it especially if you use USB2.0.\n", "Q: No Terminal No Dashboard and No Window border in Ubuntu 14.04 I upgraded Ubuntu 12.02 to 14.04 and upgraded all packages with command sudo get-apt -f install.

So I want to make this environments more alike.\nIn Windows I have such things like input language and keyboard layout.\n\nSo I can assign more than one layout to each language and use another key combination to switch layouts inside one language.\nFor example I have such configuration with approx. using time.\nEnglish language:\n\n\n*\n\n*US layout - 40%\n\n*US intl layout - 5%\n\n\nUkrainian language:\n\n\n*\n\n*RUS layout - 35%\n\n*UKR layout - 20%\n\n\nBasically I have cyrillic and latin language set and layouts inside them. I can switch between this sets with Ctrl+Shift and switch layouts with Alt+Shift.\nExample (not mine, taken from Google):\n\nAny way to do such thing on Linux without wasting hours to make patch for keyboard layout manager?\n\nA: If you open \"System Settings\", and choose \"Text Entry\", you will have an option to add more then one keyboard language. You also have the option to assign a shortcut to change the language on the fly, and show a language switch in the notification area.\nAFAIK then you cannot add a language, and add different layouts to that language in Ubuntu. Instead you add languages (each have their own layout) and just switch between those.\nIe. I can add a language \"English (US)\", and another language \"English (US International)\" and just switch between those two, they will not be \"grouped\" but you can define the order they switch.\n", "Q: Customize Colors for Bash Terminal I found this nice color library called Solarize which promises to liven up my hacking experience with a color terminal.\n\nI am not where to add the Solarize files to change.  I found some instructions if you want to use tmux and indeed I installed tmux and the script but my colors don't really change.\n\nA: Personal background\nI spend a lot of time in GVim which I’ve configured to use the Solarized colour and I love it; I really like being able to switch back and forth between the light and dark versions (depending on the ambient light conditions).\nOnce I tried it configuring my terminal emulator and it worked fine on my local computer because I had other software set up to make use of the solarized colour scheme, e.g., the LS_COLORS environment variable.\nHowever, I log on to a few other servers using SSH and I never got around to configuring all the different remote environments so I reverted to a plain old black background for my terminal emulator.\nConfiguring Gnome Terminal\nYou don’t say which terminal emulator you’re using but since you’re running Ubuntu, Gnome Terminal is available to you and you can get the Solarized colour scheme by following the instructions from Solarized Colorscheme for Gnome Terminal.\nIf you’re not familiar with using Git, you can download the files from the zip file.\nWhen you have that working, be sure to install and configure Solarized Color Theme for GNU ls (as setup by GNU dircolors).  This sets the LS_COLORS environment variable so that ls --color displays colours that work with a terminal which has a light or dark Solarized background instead of a black or white background. Note: the documentation can be daunting as it goes into a lot of detail about terminals.\nThe following links should also be useful:\n\n\n*\n\n*Color schemes, Gnome Terminal documentation\n\n*Solarized colors on Gnome Terminal\n\n*Solarized: A Must Have Color Scheme For Gnome Terminal, Vim, Gedit And Lots More\nEdit: Beginning with Ubuntu 15.04 (Vivid Vervet), gnome-terminal includes Solarized as one of its preset colour schemes.\n", "Q: Is there some program to control fan speed in Ubuntu 14.04? - Acer Aspire 5740G I have an Acer Aspire 5740(G) that overheats constantly, even in normal use. After many hours of trying fan control utilities to speed up my fan, such as fancontrol and lm-sensors, and none of them working, I decided to finally ask this question. Is there a program like the Windows app, RWEverything, that does the same thing? I know how to use this to edit my ACPI table (I think) to force the fan to run at maximum speed, but I can't find anything that works with Ubuntu.\nEven If there isn't, any fan control program that works is fine.\nThanks in advance.\nEDIT: I have cleaned the computer out, making sure there is no dust. The fan itself may be failing, but turning it up to its highest speed does help to keep the computer cooler.\nEDIT: The BIOS settings have no mention of the fan at all.\n\nA: I had the same issue last year. Solution for me was to open up the laptop and vacumeclean it.\nProblem is that, though these are called Laptops it is not wise to constantly have them located on your Lap.\n\nA: Have you cleaned inside the fan itself? You can screw the top off.

I've a Asus laptop with windows 8.1 pre-installed, I've managed to install Ubuntu alongside it, and for some days it worked fine. Today, out-of-the-blue, Ubuntu just goes black screen and I'm back at the grub menu to select one of my OS's, when I tried to boot to Ubuntu, it just says it cannot mount '/boot/efi', and it doesn't let me select none of the options ( one is to press S to bypass the mounting process and the other is to press M to manually correct the problem). If I go through the recovery mode, and try to start up normally, it let me bypass the mounting procedure and startup Ubuntu as usual.\nHow do I deactivate the mounting process at the startup?\nOr better yet, how do I solve the problem?\n\nA: The_Seppi's response answers your first question and is absolutely correct in that respect.\nAs to the question of fixing the problem, chances are that one of two things is happening:\n\n\n*\n\n*There may be something wrong with the filesystem (filesystem damage). This can happen if you use the Windows \"fast startup\" feature, which is set by default. It's imperative that you disable this feature, as described here, among many other places.\n\n*Your filesystem ID may have changed. This is the UUID=xxxx-xxxx bit from the_Seppi's response. You can find all the UUID values for your partitions by typing sudo blkid. If your entry has something else in the first column for your EFI System Partition (ESP; /boot/efi in Ubuntu), such as /dev/sda1, then that value may have changed. Such changes can occur if you backed up, created a fresh filesystem, and restored; or if you repartitioned the disk.\n\n\nThe output of the Boot Info Script (in the boot-info-script package) may be helpful if these tips don't enable you to fix the underlying problem.\n\nA: Open the file /etc/fstab in a text editor with elevated privileges. You should be able to recognise the EFI partition at once, as it will likely carry a label, such as this:\n# /boot/efi was on /dev/sda1 during installation\nUUID=xxxx-xxxx  /boot/efi       vfat    defaults        0       1\n\nIn order to prevent automatical mounting, append the noauto flag to the options column (where, in my example, \"defaults\" is standing), separated by a comma, so it might look like this:\nUUID=xxxx-xxxx  /boot/efi       vfat    defaults,noauto 0       1\n\nThis will prevent automatical mounting of this partition in the future. Should you encounter the need to access the partition, you can mount it manually by running sudo mount /boot/efi. As this directory is stored in the fstab entry, mount will automatically know what to mount there.\n\nNOTE: On my system, the /boot/efi entry was commented out. However, it is being automounted, too. So if you're going to change the fstab entry, remove any prepending #'s in front of the UUID=... /boot/efi line.\n", "Q: How do you report a seriously outdated repository mirror?

Hence you only have to type the password for your root device and the keys for all other devices will be calculated from that. (But: The devices won't have the same passwords, unless you add the same password to each one manually.)\n", "Q: Ubuntu doesn't download files using apt-get update When I type the command sudo apt-get update on Ubuntu 14.04, it downloads most of  the files but the other ones say for example: \n\nFailed to fetch http://ppa.launchpad.net/openshot.developers/ppa/ubuntu/dists/trusty/main/binary-i386/Packages  404  Not Found\n\nNow, whenever I install a PPA key, it installs but when I run sudo apt-get update it fails to download the files.

Is there a piece of software that will let me run .exe files as soon as I install the program, without having to go through a complicated process like Wine or PlayOnLinux makes me do? I would like to run Terraria on my Ubuntu system and I was hoping that there would be a simple way to do this.\n\nA: \nIs there a piece of software that will let me run .exe files as soon as I install the program\n\nNatively? That is called WINE or the add-on to it called PlayOnLinux.\n\nwithout having to go through a complicated process like Wine or PlayOnLinux makes me do?\n\nNo, that is what WINE was created for. PlayOnLinux is difficult and peculiar but I can not say it is complicated. In general PlayOnLinux requires you to follow specific instructions to the letter.\n\nI would like to run Terraria on my Ubuntu system and I was hoping that there would be a simple way to do this.\n\nThe simplest and most efficient way to play this is either over a dual boot system or using a Virtual Machine with a Windows installed in it. The only downside to a VM: it will be a bit slower. \n\nIf you really want this to run natively: it seems Terraria runs on Steam with wine. Installation: \n\nInstall wine and winetricks. Install Steam from the Website. This will update Steam and exit at 26%, Start Steam: This will update steam completely. After this,\n  log in.\ncd ~/.wine/drive_c/Program\\ Files/Steam\nwine Steam.exe\n\nDownload Terraria and install. This will install XNA Redist as\n  well. Exit Steam.Start Terraria manually with wine\ncd .wine/drive_c/Program Files/Steam/steamapps/common/terraria\nwine Terraria.exe\n\nThis will tell you that you need Mono for Windows.\nInstall Mono 2.10 and 2.8 via winetricks. People have reported\n  there is no need to install xact and xinput. If you run into trouble\n  after this point, install them and see if it fixes the problem you\n  have.\nStart Terraria.exe again. (With wine and mono). You will be\n  told that it can’t find Microsoft.Xna.Framework.\nInstall .NET 4 from the Full Installer from here!\nwine dotNetFx40_Full_x86_x64.exe\n\nIf you get a message that .NET is already installed, use\n  regedit to remove this Node: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\Software\\Microsoft\\NET\n  Framework Setup\\NDP\\v4 Then return to Step 9 above.\nCopy .NET 4 Files to Terraria directory\ncd .wine/drive_c/Program Files/Steam/steamapps/common/terraria\ncp ~/.wine/drive_c/windows/Microsoft.NET/Framework/v4.0.30319/* .\n\nStart steam and run Terraria\n\nUntested.

For example, supposing your is .Xresource, you can create a symbolic link: \ncd ~; ln -s .Xresources .Xdefaults-$(hostname) \n\n(more simply put: the resources file should be called after your hostname; so if for example your hostname is alfabeta, your resource file should be named .Xdefaults-alfabeta. The above command, typed as is in a shell, will take care of creating an alias, aka symbolic link, for your existing .Xresources file(2)) \n...and now it should load it at startup (logout and login to check, no need to reboot). \nAs a last resort, you can try to put the xrdb command in an executable script named .xprofile (works for me in Xubuntu) or .xsessionrc in your home directory, or add it to your session startup programs. \n\nFootnotes: \n(1) all the X11 resource mechanism, although not officialy obsoleted, is basically used only by programs from the 90ies and before (XJed, xterm, xfig and so on). Which I still use, together with a couple more dinosaurs. Probably the status of the maintenance of the scripts loading them is, well, lagging. Given that you are a new user, why not going with a more powerful terminal emulator like, for example, terminator? It has profiles, configurability, split screen, status line, and a lot fancier stuff than ole good xterm.   \n(2) that, by the way, I do not know why it is not working. It should be loaded by /etc/X11/Xsession.d/30x11-common_xresources, which is sourced by /etc/X11/Xsession.

Initially Ubuntu 14.04 did install, but I was unable to boot it, after trying various things. I decided to start fresh, and did a factory reset, but that didn't touch the partitions that had been created for Ubuntu. I went into Windows 8 and deleted those two partitions, and then tried installing Ubuntu again, but was given this error message while installing the grub-2 package:\n\nThe grub-efi-amd64-signed package failed to install into /target/. Without the GRUB boot loader, the installed system will not boot.\n\nI tried installing again, but only got the same error message (and two more partitions created that I don't need).\nI installed and ran boot-repair, but got this message:\nAn error occurred during the repair.\nA new file (~/Boot-Info_2015-04-15__03h43.txt) will open in your text viewer.\nIn case you still experience boot problem, indicate its content to:\nboot.repair@gmail.com\nLocked-ESP detected. You may want to retry after creating a /boot/efi partition (FAT32, 100MB~250MB, start of the disk, boot flag). This can be performed via tools such as gparted. Then select this partition via the [Separate /boot/efi partition:] option of [Boot Repair].\n\nHowever gparted isn't loading, so I can't do that. Any suggestions? I have no data on it, so I'm willing to clear everything back to the from-the-box settings, but I can't figure out how to restore the non-windows partitions back to factory settings.\n\nA: I've heard of this problem a few times before, but it's pretty rare, and I'm not sure of the cause.\nMy first suggestion is to disable Fast Startup in Windows. Note that this is not the same as \"fast boot\" or similar options in the firmware. The Windows feature turns shutdowns into suspend-to-disk operations, which results in all mounted filesystems (often including the ESP) being in an unstable state. Attempting to mount and write to these filesystems in Linux can then result in failures of various types.\nAnother thing you can try is creating a second EFI System Partition (ESP) and using it in Ubuntu in preference to the one that already exists on your disk. You said you can't do this because GParted \"isn't loading,\" but you've provided no details about what's wrong with GParted. If you need help with that, you must post failure details, such as any error messages you see.\nA third thing you can try is manually installing another boot loader. You might try my rEFInd on a USB flash drive or CD-R (images for both are available); you can try this without touching your on-disk configuration. If nothing else, that might get your existing Ubuntu install working, which might help you with further diagnostics.\n\nA: I had the same issue trying to install Ubuntu 14.04.3 on a Lenovo Z50-70 laptop with Windows 10 (updated from pre-installed Windows 8.1). I used a bootable USB for the process. \nI solved the problem by booting again from the LiveUSB and selecting the last option (Check disc for defects). It corrected one file (The GRUB one, I guess). Then, I restarted the laptop and booted from the USB. This time I chose the \"Install Ubuntu\" option and selected \"Erase Ubuntu 14.04.3 and reinstall Ubuntu\" in the further steps.\nWhen it reached the \"Installing GRUB\" part it continued without errors.

So, I downloaded a linux driver from Nvidia (NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-346.59.run).

Only copy new ringtones to appropriate folder.\n\nA: You can add & modify files in RW mode, and then do an OTA update, yes.\nHowever we never test this scenario, so if it doesn't work, or the files disappear, you'll probably need to cleanly re-flash the device to 'reset' back to a working state.\n", "Q: How do I create a script to restart a service every two hours? I want to make a simple init.d file that makes it possible for me to reset a trial service that I'm using. I am currently using CodeSys and the startup script cuts me off after 2 hours, so I need to either reset the machine or manually restart the service.\nCould someone help me to make a script that:\nservice stop codesys\nservice start codesys\n\n(every 7200 seconds in an infinite loop)\nThanks in advance!\nEDIT: Here is the startup script that has been initially included, do you find anything related to a 2 hour timer? I really don't know much about this stuff.\nhttp://pastebin.com/vzWi3FBN\n\nA: The most straightforward way is to just run once:\nsudo service start codesys && watch -n 7200 'sudo service stop codesys && sudo service start codesys'\n\nThis will execute the command sudo service stop codesys && sudo service start codesys (which stops the codesys service and on success subsequently starts it again) every 7200 seconds displaying potential output.\nNotice that in this case since the command to be executed is actually a chain of two commands the quotes to enclose the command are required.\nHere's a scrape of the relevant sections for watch from man watch (trusty):\n\n[...]\nDESCRIPTION\n       watch  runs  command  repeatedly, displaying its output and errors (the\n       first screenfull).  This allows you to watch the program output  change\n       over  time.   By  default,  the  program  is  run  every 2 seconds.  By\n       default, watch will run until interrupted.\n\nOPTIONS\n[...]\n       -n, --interval seconds\n              Specify  update  interval.   The  command will not allow quicker\n              than 0.1 second  interval,  in  which  the  smaller  values  are\n              converted.\n[...]\n\nTo make it run at startup, add this line to /etc/rc.local before the line exit 0:\nnohup sh -c \"sudo service start codesys && watch -n 7200 \\\"sudo service stop codesys && sudo service start codesys\\\"\" > /dev/null &\n\nnohup starts a process immune to SIGHUP signals, redirects the process' stdin to /dev/null and both stdout and stderr to a nohup.out file, in this case stdout and stderr are redirected to /dev/null since you don't need to check the output. To use nohup is done so that the process is not killed when the execution of /etc/rc.local terminates. The & operator puts the process in the background, so that the execution of /etc/rc.local can continue.\n", "Q: Issue with gnome-connection-manager I use Ubuntu 14.04 with gnome-connection-manager.\nEverything worked well, but then gnome-connection-manager crashed and now I can't start it. The process is not running and a reboot did not help.\nHow do I troubleshoot this issue?\nP.S. Maybe someone could also tell me where gnome-connection-manager saves the connections? \n\nA: This will not recover your gnome-connection-manager, but allow you to manage your connections through the terminal:\nYou can use nmcli instead of your normal connection manager.\nThe most useful commands are:\n\n\n*\n\n*List all configured connections:\nnmcli con\n\n\n*Display the status of all active connections:\nnmcli con stat\n\n\n*Start (up) / stop (down) a connection by name (-p = \"pretty\", displays status):\nnmcli -p con up id \"My connection's name\"\nnmcli con down id \"My connection's name\"\n\n\n*Start (up) / stop (down) a connection by UUID (-p = \"pretty\", displays status):\nnmcli -p con up uuid xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx\nnmcli con down uuid xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx\n\nYou find out the UUID of your connection by looking at the table outputted by nmcli con.\n", "Q: What is the relationship between sockets and ports? I am trying to understand the relationship between sockets and ports. I found that a socket is part of a port and it handles communication for that port. However, on another blog I read\n\nOs does not have to support sockets to support TCP or UDP !\n\nSo, if the OS on the server does not support sockets, then how will the communication happen on a specific port?\nCan someone guide me and provide a simple explanation of the relationship between ports and sockets and what exactly the role of each in communication is?\n\nA: Socket is practical address on application layer for communication.\nFormat of socket address is ip_address:protocol:port. More about socket address you can find here. \nExample: \n192.168.1.1:tcp:80 \n\nthis represent socket address of pc with ip address 192.168.1.1 witch \"expect\" connection on port 80 if you use tcp protocol.\nExample from my pc\nxxx@xxx ~ $ netstat -tp\n(Not all processes could be identified, non-owned process info\n will not be shown, you would have to be root to see it all.)\nActive Internet connections (w/o servers)\nProto Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address           Foreign Address         State       PID/Program name     \ntcp        0      0 xxx.local:54595     104.16.17.44:http       ESTABLISHED 32294/chrome    \n\nexplantion of this session\n\n\n*\n\n*my pc communicate with 104.16.17.44\n\n*connection is established\n\n*we use tcp protocol\n\n*my pc hit remote port 80 aka http port\n\n\nOverview\nthis represent communication of \nmy pc with socket address xxx.local:54595:tcp and remote pc with socket 104.16.17.44:http:tcp\nPort is practically \"hole\" for connection.\nBut on \"hole\" named port 80 you can use any service.\nOn port 80 you can serve any service on server. like ftp, ssh, pop3 or any other.\nWell known \"hole\" aka well known ports, more about port you have here\nPort is part of socket address.\nPorts and sockets ar part of tcp stack. Nice explination heve here.\nTcp stack is only one modul of OS.\n", "Q: How to stop particular instance of X server? I know this sounds ridiculous at first glance, but I started X session from root with\n# X :1 vt08 &\n\nSo I guess sudo stop lightdm would be overkill. How can I stop that instance of X server without stopping main X session?\n\nA: You should be able to find the PID of the running X instances and kill the one you don't want. For example:\n$ pgrep -a X\n3885 /usr/bin/Xorg :0 -background none -verbose -auth /var/run/gdm3/auth-for-Debian-gdm-M5IpFT/database -nolisten tcp vt7\n$ kill 3885\n\nYour output will have more than one PID since you are running multiple instances, so make sure you pick the right one. \n", "Q: Terminal : open path with middle-click/context menu? I spend a lot of time copying the paths output by grep, and pasting them after a command that opens a visual editor.\nIs there a way of programming a terminal emulator to open selected text in a specific editor?  Perhaps a middle-click on selected text, or an addition to the context menu?\nIs this perhaps a feature of some terminal I don't know?\n\nA: Create a script:\nnano ~/<your_script_folder>/open_selection\n\nInclude the following code:\n#!/bin/bash\nselected_text=$(xclip -o)\nif [[ \"$selected_text\" == ~* ]]; then\n    file_name=$(readlink -f ${selected_text/\\~/$HOME})\nelse\n    file_name=\"$selected_text\"\nfi\n\nnotify-send \"Open selection\" \"$file_name\"\nxdg-open \"$file_name\"\n\n*You can replace xdg-open with another command of your choice to open the selection with this program.\nMake the script executable\nchmod +x ~/<your_script_folder>/open_selection\n\nCreate a shortcut for this script.\nThen only select a file name in your terminal and use your shortcut. A detour via the clipboard is not required.\n\nA: What you could do as an alternative is to parse output of grep as an argument to your text editor of choice. For instance\nCOMMAND | grep -i filename | xargs nano\nIn this case nano is just a placeholder. You could use whatever text editor you want there. What you might want to do is to add a nohup in front of text editor name, so that you can continue using terminal.\nSome time ago I answered a question, Is it possible to open a terminal in the current directory?, which asked to \"open in terminal\". The workaround I've been using is to bind a shortcut to script. You could do something similar - bind a shortcut to simple script bellow:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nFILENAME=$(zenity --entry --text=\"Enter path to file\")\n\nif [ $? -eq 0 ] \n   nano $FILENAME\nfi\n\nThis basically should bring up a popup asking for path to file.\nThe path can be copied from command line with CtrlShiftC, or you can download xclip and pipe the output into xclip -sel clip (which will put your text path into clipboard)\n", "Q: How do I deploy an app to my Ubuntu phone with the Ubuntu SDK?

In qt creator, under Tools->Options->Ubuntu, I clicked on Maintain button in Framework ubuntu-sdk-14.10 and install that package. But this didn`t solve my problem.\nAny ideas ?\n\nA: libqt5sql5-mysql is not a part of the default image.  If you wish to use it, you must either install it on the phone (which I assume would require making your image writable) or include it as part of your application.\nAs an example, QHttpServer is not provided by the default image.

For US International with dead keys: setxkbmap us intl, where us is US English and intl is the variant.\nTo see the proper forms of layouts and variants, look in /usr/share/X11/xkb/rules/xorg.lst.\nEach desktop file should be created by opening a text editor, putting inside lines similar to the below and saving the file with a name similar to keyboard_FR.desktop, keyboard_US, keyboard_US-deadkeys.desktop, etc. (The name of the .desktop file may be different than the one set in the line Name=. The later is the one seen by the launcher.)\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=US - Keyboard US International dead Keys\nExec=setxkbmap us intl\nIcon=path/to/some/icon/file\nTerminal=false\nType=Application\nCategories=Application;Utility;\n\nSo, create a desktop file for each keyboard layout that you need, changing accordingly the name, command variables and icons.\nPay attention to the first letters of the line Name= because Dash and any launcher will find according to the beginning of the name. You may choose to start with a short-name of the layout (FR for French, US for US English, etc) or with a common form like Keyboard to see them all together.\nIcon= is also a useful line, to display it all better. You may find  country flags or letters ready made icons on the internet by searching \"icons flags\" or \"icons letters\". (Or use Shutter to create your own png icons by selecting a monochrome field and writing on that the short-name of the layout etc.)\nOn Synapse - here.\n\nA: Finally I found solution to this problem. I switched from Gnome classic (fallback, flashback) to Mate desktop environment. There it works fine.\n", "Q: BQ Aquaris E4.5 sound not working in web applications and mediaplayer I've recently purchased the BQ Aquaris E4.5 with Ubuntu touch and I'am quite satisfied for this first release.

I'm sure it's not a hardware problem since it plays back in ringtones and in the supplied game.\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: You mentioned having played Pathwind; did you by any chance mute the sound in Pathwind?

Suspended processes show T as part of their state when viewed via ps, whereas in your situation emacs showed S, which simply means it was waiting on an event (in this case, waiting on user interaction).\nAs explained in the \"PROCESS STATE CODES\" section of man ps:\n               S    interruptible sleep (waiting for an event to complete)\n               T    stopped, either by a job control signal or because it is\n                    being traced\n\nWhen a process is suspended, that is considered a job control signal, since suspending processes is primarily done as part of job control (with & at the end of a command, Ctrl+Z issued in the terminal, and the jobs shell builtin). See the ps manpage itself for documentation of the other state codes, D, R, W, X, and Z.\nEmacs was iconified, not suspended. When Ctrl+Z is issued to a foreground process in a terminal, it causes the process to be suspended. But you pressed Ctrl+Z while in a GUI emacs window. Ctrl+Z doesn't suspend programs when given this way--for example, in many applications (such as Firefox and LibreOffice) Ctrl+Z is the keystroke for undo.\nAs you were able to confirm, when using emacs through a graphical interface Ctrl+Z is key combination to iconify (i.e., minimize) the window or to deiconify (i.e., restore) it if it is already iconified. Of course, you must have the iconified window selected to deiconify it with Ctrl+Z, which it appears your window manager may not support.\nNote that, when you press Ctrl+Z while in a terminal window, it is not likely that emacs is itself intercepting it and suspending itself. Rather, Ctrl+Z issued in a terminal generally suspends processed, and Ctrl+Z issued in a GUI window generally does not.\nSince you said you're \"still interested in knowing how to unsuspend the process from the terminal\" and an explanation of how to know if one's process is really suspended (and when Ctrl+Z does and does not suspend a process) makes for a reasonable introduction to an answer about that, I have decided to devote the remainder of this answer to addressing that part of the question.\nResuming Suspended Processes from a Different Terminal\nIf you have access to a suspended program's controlling terminal, the jobs, fg, and bg builtins allow you to view and resume it. If you don't have access to the program's controlling terminal and all you need to do is resume the process but not give it input, or read its output, on a terminal, you can send the process SIGCONT as detailed in zhongfu's answer. This is probably what you would do if a graphical program had been suspended and you couldn't resume it from its controlling terminal. This is because the primary way we interact with most GUI apps most of the time is through their graphical UIs, and not through the terminal.\nHowever, if you need to detach a process's standard streams from its original terminal and reattach them to a different terminal--that is, to resume a suspended process and interact with it in a different terminal from the one it was started in--that is not so simple.\n\n*\n\n*You would mainly need this if it were a command-line program designed to interact with the user primarily through a terminal rather than through some other mechanism like a GUI or a local web server. For example, you're much more likely to need to do this for emacs -nw than for GUI emacs.\n\nReattaching a Process to a Different Terminal, If You Planned Ahead\nIf you anticipate this need when you run the program, you can avoid it altogether by starting the process in a terminal multiplexer rather than an ordinary terminal. screen and tmux do this; see man screen and man tmux for details. (See also byobu.) A process started in a terminal multiplexer not connected directly to the terminal through which you interact with it, but instead to a pseduo terminal provided by the multiplexer.\n\n*\n\n*For example, you could run screen emacs in one terminal, then later detach it from that terminal by pressing Ctrl+A followed by Ctrl+D and open it on another terminal (or the same one) by running screen -r. Or, if you never detached it form the first terminal, you detach it from there and reattach it to the current terminal with screen -rd.\n\nReattaching a Process to a Different Terminal, If You Didn't Plan Ahead\nIf you didn't start your program in a terminal multiplexer and need to detach it from its original and attach it to a new one, this is usually possible, though nontrivial with the utilities installed in Ubuntu by default. It can be done by opening and manipulating the process in a debugger.\nFortunately, utilities have been written with which this may be done easily--or at least attempted easily. I suggest reptyr. (See also injcode, neercs, and the comparison of the three on the reptyr page.)  Reptyr's readme file on the reptyr github page gives usage information. On Ubuntu, to download and build reptyr, run its testsuite, and install it, you can use these commands:\n# Install build dependencies and set up /usr/local/src for administrators.\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install build-essential git python-pip\npip install pexpect\ncd /usr/local/src && sudo chgrp sudo . && sudo chmod g+w,+t .\n\n# Retrieve, configure, build, test, and install reptyr.\ngit clone https://github.com/nelhage/reptyr.git && cd reptyr\nmake && sudo make test install\n\nYou may notice that I make the test target as root with sudo. Usual best practice is to build and test software as a normal user and elevate to root just to install it. However, in Ubuntu's default configuration, reptyr does not work when run by a non-root user. This is because reptyr manipulates a process's file descriptors by attaching to the process as a debugger, but as a security feature non-root processes are prohibited from debugging processes that are not their descendants.\nWhen you actually use the reptyr command, you won't run it with sudo. Instead you'll want to run reptyr as the same user who owns the process, from a terminal belonging to that user. (There might be a way to get it to work without doing that, but it's only worked for me that way.)\nUsing reptyr on Ubuntu\nAllowing processes to debug non-descendants owned by the same user is likely to cause problems only if a running program is being successfully exploited (or if you have malware). One way to allow reptyr to work while keeping your security risk relatively low is to allow it only when you need to run reptyr--which is probably, hopefully, a rare occurrence--and re-disable it afterwards.\nSo, suppose you've started a non-graphical Emacs instance (in an inaccessible terminal):\nemacs -nw\n\nThis may or may not be suspended. From another terminal, change ptrace_scope from 1 to 0 to allow processes to debug processes that are not their descendants:\necho 0 | sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/yama/ptrace_scope\n\nThen run reptyr, passing the process's PID as an argument, to attempt to detach it from the old terminal and attach it to the new one:\nreptyr PID\nYou can find the PID in the output of ps x or with pgrep or pidof. If there's only one emacs running, you can find the PID and pass it to reptyr in a single command:\nreptyr $(pidof emacs)\n\nI've found that this usually works but sometimes doesn't. If reptyr shows no output at all, you may have to press Ctrl+Z to use the program. (I don't know why that is, but running ps reveals nothing is suspended or unsuspended when I press Ctrl+Z in this specific situation, so I suspect it has to do with the interaction between reptyr and my shell's job control facilities.)\nJob control may not be fully functional with the reattached process; for example, you may not always be able to suspend it with Ctrl+Z.\nAfter you're done with reptyr you can set ptrace_scope back to 1 for security:\necho 1 | sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/yama/ptrace_scope\n\nIt is easier and more reliable to plan ahead when possible. If the terminal you start an interactive program on might become inaccessible, it's best to use a terminal multiplexer like screen or tmux (as detailed above).\n", "Q: How can I change the default Google location for Unity search in dash?

What a bad experience.\nI tried to install the Ubuntu 14.04 as a dual boot with Windows 8, but I was not successful, so I decided to erase Windows and install Ubuntu 14.04.

My guess is to divide the HDD in two: one of ~200GB to be used as /home for Ubuntu and another of ~800GB to use as data storage. The SSD would be used in two partitions: one of about 18GB or less for / installation of Ubuntu and another ~2GB partition for swap.\nIs this partitioning scheme enough for apps in Ubuntu?

How do I use non-regular variant of a font in Ubuntu?\nSimply stating, I was trying to use light variant of a font. However, I couldn't. Every time I select those light variant, Ubuntu reluctantly used the same regular one. \nFor example, Today, I was trying to use Dosis font. When I choose this using Ubuntu-Tweak (or Unity-Tweak-Tool), Ubuntu selected the light one. I wanted to use Medium one, since that was giving more contrast. But selecting Dosis-Medium gave the save light rendering!!\nLastly, I tried using fonts.conf in .config/fontconfig directory. I've put these lines in that file. Putting these lines forces Ubuntu to display medium variant, but then Every Dosis fonts become Medium. There is no way to use Light variant anymore. \n  <match>\n    <test name=\"family\"><string>Dosis</string></test>\n    <edit name=\"style\" mode=\"assign\" binding=\"strong\">\n      <string>Medium</string>\n    </edit>\n  </match>\n\nIn short, How can I select or use different variant of a font in Ubuntu.

Selecting light, medium, bold all show different results. Although the light and medium look similar at 11pt even with my sharp eyes.\nMy desktop did however close itself and restart in a rather aggressive manor once a new font selection was made and I had to log back in again.\nSo I would delete your font.conf file and make your selections making sure to note how the font looks in the bottom font preview box of the selector window and not the distracting larger fonts in the list. Increase the size as needed. Select and then restart.\n\nA: Fonts usually come compressed in several files, depending on the variations it includes: light, bold, medium, italic, italic-bold, etc.\nIf you're using a new font (e.g., a font not regularly packed in Ubuntu), you should install all its variations so you don't find any problems using them later.\n", "Q: Can't install Windows 8 while Ubuntu is already installed (want to dual boot) I am using Ubuntu 12.04 LTS.

If the host is UP (& if the firewall at both end allowing ICMP), you will get response back from the remote host, otherwise not.\nThis one-liner has an added advantage, the error message (STDERR) will be saved in a file in your homw directory ~/ping_check.txt. If you don't have internet then you can check the file content and get an idea of the cause.\nEDIT: Explanation of the command:\nThe command has three portions:\n\n\n*\n\n*[[ $(ping -c4 google.com) ]] 2>~/ping_check.txt will ping \"google.com\" 4 times and 2>~/ping_check.txt will save any error message from the command in the file ~/ping_check.txt so that you can check it later for potential problem. As we are only concerned about the success or failure of the command ping -c4 google.com we have put it inside the bash keyword [[]] so that it will return true $? = 0 if the command succeeded or false $? != 0 if the command failed. \n\n*Then we have fairly simple command echo \"I have Internet\" which will just print I have Internet only if the previous returns success, this is ensured by &&. && indicates that the next command will run only if the previous command (ping) is successful.\n\n*the next part has echo \"I don't have Internet\" after ||. || means the next command will be run only if the previous command is successful ($? != 0). So I don't have Internet will be printed only if the ping command returns failure.\n\nA: You probably are looking into Network and Sharing Center on windows, which says if you have internet or not, as shown bellow in the screen. But this is not always a reliable method. For example , on my college network, some computers say there's no internet, and yet I can surf internet just fine.\n\nheemayl alrady mentioned ping command which is the basic network testing tool on any system, windows or linux, and it is used in command line; the app for that is cmd on windows and terminal on ubuntu or any other linux distro, and macs. If you can ping -c4 google.com and get response, you have internet.\nThere's another method, graphical, using gnome-nettool, which is an app with network utilities all put together into graphical interface. Idea is the same, ping utility to test if you have response from internet; there's also traceroute, which will show if you can go past your router ip address to the internet or not.\nAnother way is through Unity Lenses and Scopes. Remember how when you type in dash when you search for some files, you get suggestions from amazon? well, that means those suggestions come from internet, right ? Personally, I have those disabled, so can't elaborate much on this.\nBut really, command line tools are far more reliable and much better and many linux users will strongly recommend you use those\n", "Q: What does this egrep command do?

So what is this?\nAlso what is the exact difference between grep, egrep and fgrep?\n\nA: When you issue egrep \"\\\" string_demo | wc -l, your shell is treating \\ as backslash escape and continuing to take input in the PS2 until you enter EOF (Ctrl + D). \nIn these cases you need to use single quotes to escape being interpreted by shell. More precisely, if you want to search for literal backslash in a file, use:\ngrep '\\\\' file.txt\n\nExample:\n$ grep '\\\\' file.txt \neagle,dove\\ ,cat\n\nHere i have made two changes, firstly used single quotes ('') and secondly used \\\\ to tell grep that i want to look for literal \\, otherwise grep will show me the following error:\n$ grep '\\' file.txt \ngrep: Trailing backslash\n\nIn a nutshell, you command can be written in following ways:\n\n\n*\n\n*Using Bash's Process Substitution:\nwc -l < <(grep '\\\\' string_demo) \n\n\n*Using usual method:\ngrep '\\\\' string_demo | wc -l\n\n****Don't use egrep, it is deprecated in favour of grep -E.\nCheck this post of U&L to get the differences between grep, grep -E & grep -F. \n\nA: egrep searches lines with whatever you tell it to search in quotes from file , wc -l counts number of lines.

So we use Rackspace for 90% of our client hosting. I typically build out the various servers and on the Linux side we use Ubuntu 14.04 LTS as our primary distro. I have a well documented note that details all the steps needed to setup and configure the server so that our devs can then deploy to it and get things going.\nIs there a better way then going in by hand and line-by-line doing all the configuration post-build? Could Vagrant or Chef be used for something like this? I have not used Vagrant or Chef enough to see if it could solve my server builds.\nHere's an example of what is done.\n\n\n*\n\n*Build server off Rackspace control panel\n\n*Once server built I SSH in and then do updates, create users, create groups, install Apache, PHP, MySQL, configure time zone, update server software, set up custom alerts, etc. \n\n*Once done in step 2 I test and hand off credentials to developers to deploy their apps.\n\n\nSo looking for a way to help automate my builds easily (without building a master image and reusing that.)\n\nA: There are many tools such as Salt, Ansibel, Chef, and Puppet that can be used for this purpose. We are currently using salt to automate all of our server builds. We evaluated other tools and decided to use salt for various reasons. I would suggest that you give salt, ansible, puppet, or chef a try to see which one you like best.\nOverall they all pretty much do the same thing :) \nTo answer your question, these tools are specifically designed for your use case and switching to salt has saved us hundreds of hours of manual work. \n", "Q: how to use mysql with less and -F I want to use less as a pager for mysql client.

How can I update or refresh the hardware details in Juju?\n\nA: I believe you will have to redeploy the service on that machine. Even in MAAS, it's usually best to recommission the node if its hardware changed.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12 ufw not allowing connections even if it says Anywhere? Currently I can't seem to connect to my Ubuntu 12.04 server unless I disable my ufw or if I do a \"ufw allow ip_address\".\nWhen I do a \"ufw status\" I get the following:\n\nI deleted the allow my ip_address and technically it should allow me to ssh into my server via that port. But it just times out. Any idea what I could be doing wrong? \n\nA: As ssh uses port 22 by default and I only see port 8880 mentioned in the screenshot. Try the following,\nsudo ufw allow ssh\n\nIf you would only want your own IP address access to ssh you could use,\nsudo ufw allow from xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx to any port 22\n\nReplace xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx with your own IP address. Please check if you have a static IP address and not a dynamic one. In general, before doing anything like this, make sure you have access to the console in some other way. Else you might end up locking yourself out.\nFrom: UFW\n", "Q: Cannot remove safely usb external hard drive, it mounts again I have an external usb hard drive, however when I try to safely remove it, the device turns off and then the device mounts itself again. I've tried to do \nsudo udisks --detach /dev/sdb\n\nHowever, the device gets mounted again!\nAny solutions? Thanks for reading :)\n\nA: For removing your device, you should un-mount it:\nsudo umount /dev/sdb\n\nin case it failed to un-mount, you should force it by add -f option:\nsudo umount -f /dev/sdb\n\n", "Q: beyond MAC address spoofing Saturday, I am going to have to attempt to connect my notebook to a network that does not like me much. It is a school network. I work there as a volunteer, but don't have a sysadmin to explain what is going on.\nI could not connect to this network before. I tried to connect via dhcp, as follows:\nservice network-manager stop\nifconfig eth0 down\nifconfig eth0 hw ether 00:11:22:33:44:55\nifconfig eth0 up\ndhclient eth0\n\n(where 00:11:22:33:44:55 is the mac address of the machine I took the cable from)\nI use live thumbdrives on the lab's machines, and they connect fine via dhcp. (I just run dhclient eth0) (the thumbdrives run debian, not ubuntu. My notebook runs ubuntu. I'd hope this would not make a difference, though)\nMy question is: is there anything else I should try ? What other hypothesis should I consider ? What other tests should I run ?\n\n(btw: yes, my computer's card is eth0)\nAbout the duplicate/close proposal: This question is specifically about other security measures. It asks \"I spoofed the MAC and got nowhere\", and asks for hypothesis as to why. It might be narrow, but it certainly is not \"how to spoof a MAC\"\n\nA: It's possible that they're using some fingerprinting algorithm (i.e. the particular behavior of that ethernet interface such as timing etc.) to determine that the physical host has changed, or they could be polling the various ports on the router (I believe this is possible using SNMP) to determine that it has changed in too short a timeframe.\nThink of this from the other angle, and Google \"prevent MAC address spoofing\" and you'll see a few vendor-specific solutions.\nAs to how you can get around it, the only possible way seems to be setting up a network bridge (i.e. internet sharing) on one of the existing computers to connect your laptop.\n\nA: Are you sure the network does only use the MAC-address for security? Modern Network Access Control (NAC) Systems use much more than just the MAC, e.g. agents on the connecting system that ensure compliance, authentication either password- or certificate-based, etc.\n", "Q: I've signed a deb package multiple times, now how can I remove a signature? How can I remove signatures from a deb package signed with a gpg key by dpkg-sig?\nI have a particular apt repository that I've set up, which through research and testing led me to manually sign my deb packages.\nI've tested it out on a package and signed it multiple times with the same key. Now there are three signatures wrapped around the deb package. \nThe command used for signing the package was:\ndpkg-sig -k ######## --sign bulder xul-ext-ubufox_3.0-0ubuntu0.14.10.1_all.deb\n\n\nA: I'm not sure if there's a better way, but at the very least you could remove the signature \"manually\" with ar:\nar d \"$yourpackage.deb\" _gpgbuilder\n\n(or additional things besides _gpgbuilder if you accomplished having \"three signatures\" by giving role names other than \"builder\").\nThis works because .deb files, at the outermost layer, are essentially just \"ar\" archives, and embedded deb sigs are stored in that outermost layer. There is a small difference between .debs created with dpkg and those created with ar, so normally it's a good idea to stick to real dpkg tools when manipulating deb files, but all modern tools (afaik) can handle both just fine.\n\nA: For embedded signatures, you can open the .deb file with file-roller, and remove the embedded signature file. You can also use ar with ar d package.deb _gpgbuilder.\nFor detached signatures, you can just open the xul-ext-ubufox_3.0-0ubuntu0.14.10.1.dsc file in a text editor, and should be able to remove the extra signature blocks from the bottom of the file.\nIf you did the same for the source package as well, you can perform a similar action on the _source.changes file.\n", "Q: DNS server with Bind9: can't resolve DNS records in forward and reverse zone files Hello everyone :) I have tried to set up my own DNS server with bind9, but although I have tried several tutorials, I still get the same error.

I can boot from CD bot not from disk I just installed ubuntu-14.04.2 on my HP elitebook 8440p laptop. I set it for dual boot with windows 7. I set up a 100GB partition for Ubuntu. The laptop has 8GB of RAM and intel core i7 processor. I can bring up Ubuntu when I boot from CD. I can still boot Windows 7. When I try booting up Ubuntu from disk I can see the disk light flashing for a while and my screen goes from completely dark to \"slightly lit\" but I never get to an Ubuntu login screen. What would be the next step to diagnose/fix this problem?\n\nA: As far as I know, you should start with windows, and after that, install Ubuntu. Ubuntu needs 2 partitions: one EXT4 at least 8 GB, and one swap at least 8 Gb.

Whenever I use the computer locally, through the terminal, if I run:\n~$ echo $SHELL\n/bin/bash\n\nHowever, if I SSH into the machine through PuTTY, and run the same command, it returns:\n/bin/sh\n\nI've checked /etc/passwd, and it's set for /bin/bash on my account, and when I run chsh, it's also set for /bin/bash. I would like to use the bash shell by default over SSH. Any suggestions?\n\nA: You can use this:\nssh -t username@host \"/usr/bin/bash\"\n\nThe -t is necessary, to create a pseudo-tty for the shell to use as an interactive shell.\nSource\n", "Q: Why does the screen go dead until I press escape every time I boot up? I have Ubuntu Studio 14.04, it is the only operating system on my machine.\nEvery time I boot up, the BIOS loads, and then the screen goes dead and will stay that way unless I press ESC, in which case the prompt to enter my password for disk encryption appears, after which everything proceeds normally. It's always done this since I installed it a few months ago. But when I realized I only had to press ESC, I decided to ignore this (minor) matter. But sometimes the screen stays dead after waking it up from being suspended, and then nothing I do with the keyboard helps - which maybe is a separate question, or maybe is related.\nWhat is this about and how can i address it?\nUpdate: I installed a proprietary driver from Nvidia, based on Azendale's input that the graphics driver may be the issue. The problem has now been replaced by a different problem. My USB keyboard doesn't work until after the password for the disk encryption program is entered, so I keep a standard keyboard connected just to enter it. It still seems, as Zacharee1 mentioned in the comments, that the disk encryption software is the cause of both issues, and I need to remove it.\nIn case it wasn't clear and it in some way matters, only the ESC key would get the screen working before.\n\nA: I don't think this is a disk encryption issue, other than that the disk encryption waits for a key to be typed. Instead, it sounds like a Plymouth (graphical bootsplash part of the system) & Graphics driver bug. Hitting ESC gets you out of the graphical boot screen to the text only one that works better with the graphics driver in use. You may want to see if you can find anything related to your brand & model of graphics card and Plymouth not showing up correctly.\n", "Q: Get previous commands in Terminal that match the currently typed command In some terminals you can do something like this...\nType some command\nnmap -sn 192.168.1.1/24\n\nThen go on to do other things in the terminal for a while. Then later you can type\nnmap\n\nand then just press the ↑ key and it will index through all of the commands that started with what you typed, in this case nmap for example.  \nMy example was pretty short but sometimes you type a very long command that you want to run again, and I know you can press ↑ until you find it again, but that goes through every command and could take a while if you typed it long ago.\nIs there anyway to get this to work in Ubuntu's Terminal?\n\nA: I always use history it's just more convinient for me to see all the commands that I type for example:\nhistory\n\nlists you all commands that you typed for a while\nhistory | grep nmap\n\nlists you only commands with nmap\nhistory | grep nmap | tail -10\n\nhistory | grep nmap | head -10\n\nlists you last and first 10 commands with nmap\nthen just copy and paste it again.\n\nA: The way that I prefer to use to achieve this is by re-maping the Up and Down keys to Bash's history search. This can be achieved by adding the following to .inputrc:\n\"\\e[A\": history-search-backward\n\"\\e[B\": history-search-forward\n\nAfter reloading your shell, pressing Up or Down on an empty prompt will navigate through all of the commands, and pressing Up or Down after typing e.g. nmap will navigate through all of the commands that started with what you typed.\n\nA: If you are in vi mode in bash (set -o vi), you can go in command mode (press Esc), and then type /whatever_you_want, followed by Enter.\nIt will search whatever you want, and you can scroll with j and k keys. Hit enter when you found the right command.\nTo be able to type commands when you have hitted Esc, you have to hit i (this is vi).\nGoing back to \"normal\" shell mode is done via set -o emacs.\n\nA: Yes, there is a very simple way to search through your command history. When at the terminal, press Ctrl-R to begin a search, then you can type nmap and it will search back to the last command using nmap.\nIf you don't want the last command that contained the 'nmap' word but some other further to the past, then you can hit Ctrl-R again as many times as you'd like.\n", "Q: Ubuntu Server doesn't boot after initial install boot on external hard drive on ASUS G75V I am trying to install Ubuntu server on a 500gb WD external hard drive. I have an ASUS G75V running Windows 7 off of an SSD with another internal hard drive for storage. I have installed Ubuntu server onto the external hard drive both off a disk and a USB and each time it installs properly, restarts, and boots up normally.\nI can do everything on Ubuntu fine but when I shutdown and restart, I cannot boot into the external drive. GRUB2 should be working because during the restart after installation it starts GRUB2 and I select Ubuntu. \nIf I go into the boot menu I can see my external hard drive but every time I select it it just boots Windows. I have disabled UEFI as well and still nothing. If I put back in the installation USB or disk it does not recognize the external either at the GRUB2 menu and asks if I want to install. \nMost solutions online have to do with secure boot which I don't believe I have. Nothing I try boots me back into the new Ubuntu I just installed even though it appears set up correctly.\n\nA: I got it working by turning off UEFI mode during installation of Ubuntu server on the external hard drive. With this disabled I was able to install and then access GRUB2 from the boot menu and boot Ubuntu from there.\n", "Q: Speeding properly Ubuntu 14.04 Could you tell me if there is some steps to take to make ubuntu 14.04 faster?\n\nA: There are a few ways you can try to speed it up.

To do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install MATE desktop by running this in Terminal: sudo apt-get install mate-desktop-environment.\n\n*Once it's done installing, log out. There should now be a gear icon in the top right corner of the password area.\n\n*Click this gear and select the MATE desktop environment before logging in.\n\n", "Q: Grub dont shows after windows 8.1 update I had ubuntu 14.04.2 LTS installed in dual boot with windows 8 with grub2 as boot manager. The problem arose when the updated windows 8 for windows 8.1, now grub is no longer displayed when starting and windows 8.1 is loaded automatically. To be able to access the grub, it is necessary that when the notebook is booting, press F12 (bios boot options), there is listed, among other things, Windows 8.1 and Ubuntu, only when I select Ubuntu grub2 screen appears showing the option to select: Windows OS loader, Ubuntu, Ubuntu and advanced options.\nSo, I wonder what to do to start to load the grub screen automatically.\nThanks for any help!\n\nA: This question was also answered here and here\nThe problem is that the Windows installer doesn't know about Grub or any other OS's boot loaders, so it usually replaces it with the Windows boot loader. The Windows boot loader only knows how to boot Windows.\nThis page describes how to recover your grub bootloader.\nThe preferred (GUI) method:\n\n\n*\n\n*use your Ubuntu CD and start a Live session (i.e. boot from the CD), or similarly boot from a Live USB.\n\n*Install and run Boot-Repair\n\n*Click \"Recommended Repair\"\n\n*Reboot your system.\n\n\nGrub should now appear.

My default mirror server was very slow and so I decided to switch to another server to speed up the updating process. However, because there are so many of these servers to choose from -- most of which are hosted on sites I never knew about -- one question keeps bugging me about switching from the default one: Is it generally safe to do that? \nAll kind feedback is welcome.

I'm unable to find any obvious problems in /var/log/lightdm or /var/log/Xorg.0.log (though I'm happy to post them if they would be helpful).\nCurrent workaround (but imperfect): I can start X from a console but when I do this, I run into another problem which is that sound is unusable (despite attempts to restart pulseaudio and mpd). I suspect that the original lightdm is locking the soundcard in some way so if I can fix the lightdm login issue, it will fix the sound problem.\nOne other datapoint: From lightdm, I can log in as a different user (one that's basically in default state) and everything works fine -- Xfce starts up and sound works for them.\nDoes anyone have an idea of how to debug the lightdm problem?\nUpdate:\nTried some of the actions from Ubuntu gets stuck in a login loop -- my .Xauthority, .ICEauthority, and /tmp permissions don't seem to be the problem:\n% ls -la ~/.Xauthority\n-rw------- 1 dmcc dmcc 99 Apr 15 21:58 /home/dmcc/.Xauthority\n% ls -la ~/.ICEauthority \n-rw------- 1 dmcc dmcc 10584 Apr 15 22:00 /home/dmcc/.ICEauthority\n% ls -ld /tmp/        \ndrwxrwxrwt 6 root root 20480 Apr 15 22:48 /tmp/\n\nI also tried dpkg-reconfigure lightdm (no change).\nUpdate 2:\n\n\n*\n\n*Tried reinstalling lightdm with apt-get purge lightdm and apt-get install lightdm (problem remains).\n\n*Also tried deleting .Xauthority.\n\n*I've straced the root lightdm process (once for my user logging in, once for the dummy user logging in) but it doesn't reveal much file system access to paths in the users home directories.\n\n\nA: tl;dr: My specific problem was that at one point I had put exec /bin/zsh in ~/.bashrc (no memory of why I did this). strace was not able to track this down but fatrace was since it could trace accesses for the whole system, not just a process subtree.\nProbably boring details: I was pretty sure that my issue had to do with something in my primary users home directory since I had another user who could login fine. From my straceing, I suspected that the process doing the file access was not in the same subtree as lightdm since I had straced it recursively. So, I looked for ways to trace my whole system to try to figure out which filesystem accesses were different when each user was logging in.\nI found \nHow do I log file system read/writes by filename in Linux? and How do I strace the whole system? First, I tried systemtap but this got stuck on an internal error in ld. Eventually, I found fatrace. Like strace, this didn't include much access to my home directory, but it did have this (perfectly normal) line:\nlightdm-session(11474): O /home/dmcc/.bashrc\n\nOnce I looked into .bashrc, I saw where I had once messed with it. When I commented out the exec statement, login succeeded. It remains unclear to me why I didn't run into this earlier or why my .bashrc should matter when starting X11 even if my default shell is zsh.\n", "Q: I tried to install Ubuntu 14.04 on an old laptop in place of Windows 8.1, and now it won't boot I have an old laptop with a broken screen that I'm trying to set up to stream sports games to my TV with, and I tried to install Ubuntu 14.04 on it from USB.

I feel like I've googled everything possible trying to research it and I've come to a bit of a dead end.\nThank you all for your help in advance!\n\nA: Resources http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2147295 \nYou have got a Lenovo model try to find a post about.\n\nA: If the computer shipped with Windows 8 or 8.1 and has a Windows sticker on it, the contract between the manufacturer and Microsoft requires that you be able to disable Secure Boot. There's no requirement that you be able to do this in any particular way, so you may need to check your menus very carefully. The option might not even mention \"Secure Boot\" by name; it could be \"Boot Mode\" with options of \"Windows OS\" and \"Other,\" or something equally nondescript, or even outright deceptive. I've seen a few people suggest that Secure Boot can be disabled only if BIOS/CSM/legacy support is enabled on some systems, although I've never seen this linkage myself.\nThe fact that I just wrote a paragraph about this should make you think that I'm suggesting you disable Secure Boot. If you came to this conclusion, you're correct; your symptoms are consistent with a Secure Boot bug that causes Secure Boot to not accept the signature on your copy of Shim. Your symptoms are also consistent with a Shim that's mis-matched to your GRUB and MokManager binaries. This should not happen if you installed Ubuntu from scratch on a clean disk, but it might happen if you fiddled with the binaries after the fact or if you had an existing EFI/ubuntu directory on your ESP when you began.\nIf disabling Secure Boot doesn't help, try installing a different Shim binary, along with its matchin MokManager.efi binary. This version is old but has worked for me on one system that's finicky about its Secure Boot signatures. Note that if you install a non-Ubuntu Shim, you'll need to enroll Canonical's certificate using the MokManager utility. (It should pop up automatically, provided you installed the MokManager.efi that matches your shimx64.efi.) It's available in an Ubuntu package, but I don't recall which one offhand. I've collected several in the rEFInd package; see here for download links to them all. You want canonical-uefi-ca.der.\n", "Q: Why can't I kill viber using terminal?

I am trying to automate the refreshing of awstats for my webserver and understand that I need to use cron to set that up.  So each user has a crontab file?\nI was following the instructions here community/AWStats\nAnd it says to go to the file at: /etc/crontab\nThat file already has some information in it.  Is this the main crontab file or something?  I have seen some instructions online to use the file that pops up with crontab -e.\nWhat is the proper file to use and the best way to do this?\nIf I schedule a task as my non-root user, will it run by itself at the time interval as specified, with no issues?\nWill I need to restart the server after saving the cron job in the crontab file before it will start working?\n\nA: Every user has it's own crontab.\nTo see it just type\ncrontab -l\n\nand, yes you've seen it right, when you want to add a crontab then simply do\ncrontab -e\n\nfor the first time you'll be asked about the editor to use with crontab. As you are a newbie as you say, I'd recommend to use nano, it's the simplest editor to use.\nThe crontab itself works like this\nMIN =  Minute 0-60\nHOUR = Hour [24-hour clock] 0-23\nMDAY = Day of Month 1-31\nMON = Month 1-12 OR jan,feb,mar,apr ...\nDOW =  Day of Week 0-6 OR sun,mon,tue,wed,thu,fri,sat\nCOMMAND = Command to be run Any valid command-line\n\nSo e.g. to trigger a job every 15 minutes only on monday, you do it like so\n*/15 * * * mon /home/me/yourscript.sh\n\nand YES it's very important that you put your cronjob into the crontab of the user which has enough rights to execute it.\nSo if your script needs to be root or a special user, make sure to su to that user and add the cronjob there.\nAlso very important!\ncronjob is dumb! Yes I said it. Always make sure to enter the full PATH to the application/command/script you are using, because crontab won't work with .bashrc or similar. You always have to make sure that you tell cron where it can find the files and directories.\nTo answer the rest of your questions:\nOf course it will run on it's own, that's what it's there for. But you need to check that cronjob really does it, or if it's missing something. E.g. log into a logfile to see if it really works. \nAnd NO, a restart is not needed. A restart with linux is normally only needed, if you install a new kernel. For it to use you'd need to reboot. Almost everything else can be done without reboot in Linux. Of course there are exceptions, but in general this statement is correct.\n\nA: What is the proper file to use and best way to do this?\ncrontab -e is the best way to do it - this will allow you to easily edit per-user crontabs.\nIf I schedule a task as my non-root user, will it run by itself at the time interval as specified, with no issues?\nYes, and it will run with the privileges of that user account.\nAs a principle, it is best to run scheduled tasks with the lowest privileges you can get away with, so if what you are doing will not require root, don't use root.  If you don't even need to be able to access your account's files and folders, then you can create a new user and use that user account only for that task.  On the other hand if your task does require root, use root's crontab (su / sudo su to root then use crontab -e).\nWill I need to restart the server after saving the cron job in the crontab file before it will start working?\nNo it'll start working straight away (well, the next possible scheduled time).\nWhy not edit the file directly?  Where is it located?\nThe user crontab files are located in /var/spool/cron/crontabs, but their permissions are set in such a way that they can't be traversed to without superuser permission (but once open and the cron process drops privileges it can still access the file).\nThe system is not designed for end users to edit these files directly, and indeed the top of the file has a stern DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE warning at the top to this effect.  The file is instead designed to be edited via crontab -e which sets up a temporary mirror of the file in /tmp for editing - without the stern warning - after which it checks and installs the permanent crontab file itself.  This can all be done without superuser permission.\nIf you did edit the crontab file directly I don't know what the result would be.  It's possible it simply wouldn't take effect until next restart and any errors may be hard to debug.\n", "Q: What environment variable should I use to set a default web browser?

Is it safe to delete the Windows files and folders without having ANY repercussions? I do plan on using the external drive on Windows based computers here and there, but will use it on my Ubuntu based computer most of the time.\nHere's a list of some of the files and folders that seem important: \"pagefile.sys\", \"SYMEFA.DB\", \"found.000\", \"msdownld.tmp\", \"$RECYCLE.BIN\", \"System Volume Information\", \"IndexerVolumeGuid\"\n\nA: You have recycled your old Windows HD ? Very commendable. I can see that there are no important files left: Pagefile.sys is the swap space for windows, found.000 is part or whole of a lost file, take a look at whats inside. SYMEFA.DB probably belongs to Symantec, could be virus defenitions. msdownload is a temp file for upgrades $RECYCLE.BIN is the Trash can, mounting the drive on another windows will create a new instance, see if its empty. System Volume Information is where windows keeps its backup files for restoring to a point in time, added to at updates, for roll back. Index.. is the Index for fast access, now useless. so you can delete them all. Hope you saved all your mails.\nHappy Ubunting\n\nA: If you have not encountered any data missing on the drives, most probably it is safe to remove them. However this is something that you  will have to decide for yourself, based on understanding what these files are:\nHere are some starting points:\npagefile.sys: http://lifehacker.com/5426041/understanding-the-windows-pagefile-and-why-you-shouldnt-disable-it\nFound000: https://superuser.com/questions/124690/what-can-i-do-with-chk-files-in-found-000-folders\n\"System Volume Information\"\nhttps://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows8_1-hardware/how-do-i-prevent-system-volume-information-files/815b0046-d631-4419-a43e-44083a3733f5\nhttp://www.theeldergeek.com/system_volume_information_folder1.htm\n\nA: You may delete those files, System Volume Information and $RECYCLE.BIN will be recreated when you attach your drive to windows computer, pagefile.sys is related to Windows os so it isn't created on non system partitions and drives, found.000 is related to Windows scan disk (check disk) utility, msdownld.tmp is related to installation of MS applications in Windows (like Internet explorer).\n", "Q: No polish signs in terminal I have changed my .bashrc file, so that $LANG variable is always set to\nen_US when I run new shell.

After the installation was successful, I restarted the system, but my system directly booted up to new Ubuntu. There was no initial GRUB screen where I could choose which OS to boot up. I started working in the Ubuntu again and I checked that my Windows and previous Ubuntu were still installed in hard drive but I didn't knew how to access those. Once again I thought I should try to install the windows again. I had the iso file of Windows 8.1. I burned it on USB stick through Ubuntu Terminal by using the command\nsudo dd bs=4M if=windows8.iso of=/dev/sdc\n\nand I tried to install the windows through it but system didn't recognized the boot device.

As long as no other process accesses the volume, the VM runs fine. But recently I copied a larger file to that volume too and I almost got no iops out of my VM. Opening even small programs inside the VM took up to several minutes. The copy process in contrast runs on acceptable speed. Furthermore I used gzip to zip that large file on the btrfs volume and virtual box seems to have issues keeping the VM alive (vm windows turns grey, did not respond).\nI found that using the mount option noatime could help to improve performance, but as I only access two files on the volume (the VM's VDI and the other file) I think this would not improve the situation much.\nCould you please explain this behaviour to me and maybe suggest something to improve the VM's throughput?\n\nA: If you have a disk image on a BTRFS volume, you might need to turn off the Copy on Write feature, at least for your VM disk image.\nCoW copies altered data to a new space (with its alterations) before modifying the file header data. On a VM this means shoving a HUGE file around for even the most basic change.\nYou can have CoW turned off on a disk image file if you copy (not move) it to a directory on which this command was run:\nchattr +C directory\n\nHowever this does not guarantee No_COW, as you may create Btrfs subvolume snapshot containing the image file (that will make it cow-only-once).\n", "Q: CTRL + ALT + L and CTRL + ALT + DEL are not working in ubuntu 12.04?

So, it's not like the fault is in the core of the system or something like that.\nI can live with that, of course, but it is just interesting why is that happening.\n\nA: Depends on localization. Not everyone agrees on what \"week 1\" is in a year. In Holland for instance week 1 starts when it has 4 or more days in that year (so week 1 is that week where the 1st Thursday is in the new year). But other countries start week 1 on Jan 1st or on the 1st Monday that is in the new year. And you can get a deviation of 1 between the methods used.\nMy clock (using Dutch localization):\n\nCheck \"settings\" \"Language support\" \"Regional formats\" for what you are using. Mine is set to \"Netherlands\". Then check on-line how for that country week 1 is defined.\n", "Q: 4K (3840x2160) with GeForce GT 730M (Notebook Acer v3-571g) on HDMI port not working I have a notebook Acer v3-571g with a GeForce GT 730M and try to get my new Samsung UHD Monitor 28\" \"U28D590D\" to work in a 4K resolution via HDMI.\nAs I can see on http://www.geforce.com/hardware/notebook-gpus/geforce-gt-730m/specifications the resolution should be supported. As the notebook is from 2012 I suppose the HDMI-version should support this as well.\nlspci | grep VGA \n00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation 3rd Gen Core processor Graphics Controller (rev 09)\n01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: NVIDIA Corporation GK107M [GeForce GT 730M] (rev a1)\n\nI tried the following graphic drivers:\n\n\n*\n\n*nvidia-331\n\n*nvidia-331-updates\n\n*nvidia-346\n\n*nvidia-340\n\n*nvidia-349\n\n*xserver-xorg-video-nouveau\n\n\nAfter working through numerous threads I tried to add the resolution by the following command (tried different settings as well):\ngtf 3840 2160 30\nxrandr --newmode \"3840x2160_30.00\" 339.57  3840 4080 4496 5152  2160 2161 2164 2197  -HSync +Vsync\nxrandr --addmode HDMI1 \"3840x2160_30.00\"\nxrandr --output HDMI1 --mode \"3840x2160_30.00\"\n\nThe monitor should support this resolution via HDMI with 30hz.\nUsing the propritary nvidia drivers, I notice that nvidia-settings does not detect two monitors, the ubuntu display tool does, but it only offers resolutions up to 1920x1080 (which works).\nThis experience reminds me of trying to get wireless to work on Ubuntu 5.04. Is it too early to use 4k on Ubuntu?\nI'd be thankful for any hints. I'm wondering if this is a software problem or whether my hardware is not sufficient.\n\nA: 4k resolutions are only supported in the HDMI spec at 30hz officially, most monitors and graphics cards will stick to the spec by default.\nHowever 30hz is not nice , it feels laggy and slow to use.\nI've had some luck using cvt to generate custom modelines which pushed the refresh up to 44hz which seemed to be a sweet spot in terms of being the most my graphics card (intel 4000 + GeForce GT 750M in optimus) could output reliably. It will take around 10 to 20 seconds to sync and if you have the refresh rate too high the screen will periodically blank and resync. If it doesn't work it will not damage your monitor like the old CRT's did so experiment away. I was able to get 44hz to stay synced solidly all day. \nThe cable that came with my monitor could not handle this but the 'amazon basics high speed hdmi with ethernet' cable i bought for a few quid could so its worth trying a few cables if this isn't working straight away.\nHeres the script i wrote for setting up my screen\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# setup my massive monitor at 45hz if its plugged in\n\nRESOLUTION=\"3440 1440 44\" \nOUTPUT=\"HDMI-0\"\n\nCONNECTED=$(xrandr --current | grep -i hdmi | cut -f2 -d' ')\n\nif [ \"$CONNECTED\" = \"connected\" ]; then\n    MODELINE=$(cvt $RESOLUTION | cut -f2 -d$'\\n')\n    MODEDATA=$(echo $MODELINE | cut -f 3- -d' ')\n    MODENAME=$(echo $MODELINE | cut -f2 -d' ')\n\n    echo \"Adding mode - \" $MODENAME $MODEDATA\n    xrandr --newmode $MODENAME $MODEDATA\n    xrandr --addmode HDMI-0 $MODENAME\n    xrandr --output HDMI-0 --mode $MODENAME\nelse\n    echo \"Monitor is not detected\"\nfi\n\n", "Q: ubuntu fault update manager When I install my program to the problems we encounter.\nengmmrj@engmmrj-MS-7592:~$ sudo apt-get --reinstall install virtualboxReading package lists...

Is there anyway to fix this? It seems both extremely time consuming and potentially dangerous to manually remove each broken package. What to do?\nThanks in advance\n\nA: First of all make a copy of every important files you have on the system!\nAfter that you can try the following:\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure -a\nsudo apt-get clean && sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get -f install && sudo apt-get clean && sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\nIf that doesn't help, you should reinstall the system. \n\nA: Unsure whether to post this as an answer or edit to my original post, but here goes: I had reason to believe Cinnamon was, at least partially, causing all the conflicts and whatnot (things in general weren't looking/working like they're supposed to) so I removed all associated packages with Synaptic, plus all other 3d party packages and then tried upgrading through the Update Manager and it actually worked! Problem solved, but thanks for the tips guys!\n", "Q: How to re-install libgcc1:i386 which breaks libgcc1? So, I went and did something very stupid. I have ubuntu-toolchain-r repository added to repositories which has up to some time ago provided libgcc1:i386 among other things. For a some time now the i386 packages have been shown as kept back during upgrades. I've ignored those since they are rather vital libraries but today I decided to look into it a bit.\nI stumbled upon this \"The following packages have been kept back:\" Why and how do I solve it? and went to use the aptitude gui approach without realizing that it shall do basically the same thing as apt-get dist upgrade and as the gui hanged for a while, it took in my key presses after a while without me having a chance to do anything before it started to do some horrid package removing to my misfortune. I went and killed the aptitude process but a lot of damage was already done.\nSo afterwards killing aptitude I carefully went through the list of packages that it had removed and re-installed those. All except the ones that need ia32-libs or libc6:i386, meaning for example my wine and lots of other 32-bit applications and packages that I use because it all comes down to the fact that I can't re-install libgcc1:i386 package since it breaks libgcc1 package and vice versa (same goes for libstdc++6).\nahti@ahti:~$ sudo apt-get install libgcc1:i386\nReading package lists...

I installed Ubuntu 14 on my PC, but it failed to recognise the keyboad, so was of no use.  I therefore reinstalled Ubuntu, using the option to overwrite all files, but it appears to have created a second OS on the PC.  Now, when I boot up, I get the faulty version.  If I then press the reset button, I get the good version.  Next time I start the PC, I'll get the faulty version again.  How do I stop this from happening?  I guess the answer is to delete the faulty version, but I thought I'd done that by reinstalling, but obviously not.\nHere is the output of sudo parted -l:\nATA Maxtor 6B200P0 (scsi) Disk \n/dev/sda: 204GB Sector size (logical/physical): 512B/512B \nPartition Table: msdos \n\nNumber Start  End   Size   Type     FileSystem        Flags \n1      1049kB 198GB 198GB  primary  ext4              boot \n2      198GB  204GB 6210MB extended \n3      198GB  204GB 6210MB logical  linux swap (v1)\n\n\nA: From what I remember reading, you may be able to use a tool such as \"Grub Customizer\" to change the order of the boot, so you get the one you want. Would you be able to also boot into the good version and then remove all files from the bad partition and format the drive (GParted) and then boot only the good one?\nHaving troubles in the past related to this, I personally found that backing up all your data and then a fresh install is the way to go. I used the USB flash pen and all was fine my end. \n\nA: You might have installed the new installation side-by-side of the original installation. I would recommend to do:\n\n\n*\n\n*a backup of all your data (unencrypted)\n\n*a complete removal of all partitions on the hard drive, using a live Ubuntu CD or USB drive. \n\n*Do a fresh installation (that'll hopefully function as normal). \n\n", "Q: Dual boot: several Windows 7 loading entries in GRUB2 - should I delete any? The system is Acer Extensa 2510G, and there's only one HDD.\nThis is how the GRUB2 menu looks:\n\nOutput of sudo update-grub2:\n\nThe scripts themselves:\nWindows UEFI bootmgfw.efi:\nsearch --fs-uuid --no-floppy --set=root F27A-20E4\nchainloader (${root})/EFI/Microsoft/Boot/bootmgfw.efi\n\nWindows Boot UEFI loader:\nsearch --fs-uuid --no-floppy --set=root F27A-20E4\nchainloader (${root})/EFI/Boot/bootx64.efi\n\nWindows Boot Manager (on /dev/sda1):\ninsmod part_gpt\ninsmod fat\nset root='hd0,gpt1'\nif [ x$feature_platform_search_hint = xy ]; then\n    search --no-floppy --fs-uuid --set=root --hint-bios=hd0,gpt1 --hint-efi=hd0,gpt1 --hint-baremetal=ahci0,gpt1  F27A-20E4\nelse\n    search --no-floppy --fs-uuid --set=root F27A-20E4\nfi\nchainloader /EFI/Microsoft/Boot/bootmgfw.efi\n\nSo can I safely delete any of these entries?\n\nA: For future reference, code samples should be entered with four spaces preceding each line. Using carats (>) at the start of the line is used for quoting content, and does not preserve critical code formatting. I've fixed your question so it's properly formatted. See here for more on formatting features on this site.\nAs to your question, there are two answers. The first is empirical: Try each option from your GRUB menu and remove any that does not work. If two or more work, you can choose which to delete randomly.\nThe second answer is more theoretical: The /EFI/Microsoft/Boot/bootmgfw.efi file is the official location of the Windows boot loader, whereas /EFI/BOOT/bootx64.efi is the fallback/default EFI boot loader. In practice they may be the same binaries under two names, but another OS might overwrite the latter. The Windows boot loader shouldn't be replaced or erased, but buggy tools and hackish workarounds for buggy EFIs may dictate otherwise. The third GRUB configuration that you quote is simply a more elaborate version of the first one. Personally, I'd keep it simple if simple works.\n", "Q: Altering files kept on Windows through Ubuntu? My laptop which had Windows 7 on it crashed today. Being unable to access any file kept within, I found about the LiveCD. So I created a LiveUSB with Ubuntu in it, and managed to access my Windows desktop. I'm now backing up files important to me, but I have a question:\nNow I'm cutting and pasting the files I want to save, using Ubuntu. Are these files being moved in Windows as well, or do the alterations I make through Ubuntu not affect the Windows state? \nSo let's say,if I cut and paste all of the D drive, and then format C and reboot with Windows, would the files in D have been gone (since they were cut and not copied) or still be there?\nThanks.\n\nA: Any files you move on your drives using the live cd will be moved on these drives. In other words, these files are \"moved in windows as well\" to use your words.\nThere are a few things that you want to go about carefully, though:\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy rather than cut your files. If something is wrong with the harddrive you might lose files while cutting.\n\n*Make sure you backup the D drive before you format the C drive. We have people coming in here every week with data loss because they don't fully understand all the implications of partition (and they are many).\n\n*Take into account that some files might have windows specific permissions. So don't just expect to copy-paste all your stuff and have it work out of the box. Word files, images, videos, and all that should be fine, but app data might not.\n\n*Why not stick with Ubuntu?\n\n", "Q: How do I get nohup to execute [double-]quoted inner commands? Let's say I want to run echo nested into watch nested into nohup.\nStarting from the bottom of the stack:\necho test\n\nNo problems with that.\nwatch -n 1 'echo test'\nwatch -n 1 \"echo test\"\n\nNo problems with those either.\nnohup 'watch -n 1 \"echo test\"'\nnohup \"watch -n 1 'echo test'\"\n\nProblems with those:\n~$ nohup 'watch -n 1 \"echo test\"'\n~$ nohup: ignoring input and appending output to ‘nohup.out’\n~$ nohup: failed to run command ‘watch -n 1 \"echo test\"’: No such file or directory\n~$ nohup \"watch -n 1 'echo test'\"\n~$ nohup: ignoring input and appending output to ‘nohup.out’\n~$ nohup: failed to run command ‘watch -n 1 'echo test'’: No such file or directory\n\nHow do I get nohup to execute [double-]quoted inner commands?\n\nA: nohup isn't expecting any quotes. It doesn't know how to deal with them.\nThe command you want is simply:\nnohup watch -n 1 'echo test'\n\nIn this case you could even go without the inner quotes:\nnohup watch -n 1 echo test\n\nJust be conscious of how nohup works though. It redirects all output in quite a raw way. You won't be able to monitor the output of watch in quite the same way.\n", "Q: how to remaster ubuntu 14.10 (currently installed ) i want to remaster my ubuntu as I want to create my spin of ubuntu for my friends .

Sorry.\nI've bought a new HP Pavilion 15-p239sa with Windows 8.1 installed, and I'm trying to dual boot Ubuntu 14.04.  The problem is that after installation of Ubuntu, it still just boots to Windows without displaying the GRUB menu for me to pick Ubuntu.  Here is the sequence of events:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download Ubuntu 14.04 from the Ubuntu web site and burn to DVD\n\n*Install Ubuntu as directed and reboot: laptop boots to Windows only\n\n*Install and run boot-repair from live disk as instructed.  Boot-repair says to disable secure boot\n\n*Disable secure boot and reboot.  No change.\n\n*Install and run boot-repair again from live disk.  No errors reported.\n\n*Re-boot.  Still can only access Windows.\n\n*Ran bcdedit /set {bootmgr} path \\EFI\\ubuntu\\shimx64.efi. Ran OK and reported no errors.\n\n*Re-boot.  Still can only boot Windows.  GRUB menu still not showing.\n\n\nThe report from boot-repair is at: http://paste.ubuntu.com/10826849/\nI'd really appreciate it if anyone could help.\nPeter\n\nA: Here is a step by step on how I did it:\n 1. Install Windows 8.1\n 2. disable secureboot in bios (or in some cases allow it to run other Os's)\n 3. turn off fast boot\n 4. install ubuntu alongside windows.\n\nA: Try this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot your Ubuntu installation disc, but select the \"try before installing\" option.\n\n*Open a Terminal window.\n\n*Verify that the /sys/firmware/efi directory is present. If not, reboot in EFI mode. (You were in EFI mode when you installed.)\n\n*Type sudo efibootmgr -o 2,2002,1,3001. This command changes the boot order so that GRUB is first. (See lines 954-963 in your Boot Repair output.) Note that you can change the order and the included options as you see fit; the critical point is that 2 be first in the list, since that's your GRUB. (This number varies from system to system; for somebody else it may be some other value.)\n\n*Reboot.\n\n\nIf that doesn't fix it, my recommendation is to return the computer to the store for a refund, buy another brand, and write a letter to HP explaining the problem and telling them that you returned the computer because of it. Your EFI should not have the problem that you describe, and if it doesn't work correctly after the fix I've described, it means that the firmware is badly defective, like a TV with half the image missing or a stereo that can play nothing but polka music. Unfortunately, manufacturers have been putting out junky EFIs for years, and they'll continue to do so unless customers stop being sheep and communicate their displeasure with the junky EFIs. Returning a system is the only effective means of communication we have, since manufacturers give other forms of communication scant attention.\nIf you're willing to accept a defective firmware, you can rename your boot files to trick the computer into launching GRUB rather than the Windows boot loader. There's an option to do this on the Boot Repair Advanced menu; or you can do it manually, as described here with respect to rEFInd, although you'll need to tweak the filenames for use with GRUB. You'll also need to generate a new GRUB menu (via sudo update-grub) after a manual update.\n\nA: Here's how the issue was resolved in my case, with the help of the volunteers at Boot-Repair:\n\n\n*\n\n*Do a normal install of Ubuntu alongside Windows following the well-known instructions (turn off secure boot, turn off fast boot etc etc). In other words do the stuff I'd done before posting this question.\n\n*If Ubuntu is inaccessible, run Boot Repair from a live disc and try again. If Ubuntu is still inaccessible, try the following.\n\n*Boot on your Ubuntu live-disc and choose \"Try Ubuntu\". Then open a terminal when you're in Ubuntu and type the following commands:\nsudo mount /dev/sda2 /mnt\nsudo mv /mnt/EFI/HP /mnt/EFI/HPbkp\nsudo mv /mnt/EFI/Microsoft /mnt/EFI/Microsoftbkp\nFor me, this made the machine boot into Ubuntu instead of Windows, but still did not show the GRUB menu. This being the case, I then had to do the following  \n\n\n*Open a terminal in Ubuntu and type: gksudo gedit /etc/grub.d/25_custom   \n\n*Edit the text 25_custom text file, replacing: /EFI/Microsoft/Boot/bootmgfw.efi with \n/EFI/Microsoftbkp/Boot/bootmgfw.efi\n\n*Reboot and select Windows UEFI bootmgfw.efi from the GRUB menu (which now did appear), to get into Windows. Select Ubuntu to get into Ubuntu, obviously.\n\n\nObviously the names of partitions (e.g. sda2) and text files (e.g. 25_custom) may well be unique to a particular installation. There are also some things here that are clearly specific to HP, like /mnt/EFI/HP.\nI hope this gives some pointers to other people struggling with this and kudos to the Boot-Repair team.\n\nA: Open your boot settings. And go to system configuration section. Then select OS boot manager. Each firmware has its own paths to reach there , in some cases you can see it under boot options. Somehow reach OS BOOT MANAGER option as per your firmware.  Then hit enter over  OS BOOT MANAGER you will see two options windows and ubuntu's boot file. Use f5 of f6 as per your firmware to move it upwards or downwards(it will be listed there) . Ubuntu's boot file must be given priority.then save and exit. \nNow your system will be working fine.\nThanks\n", "Q: Installation of Skype 4.3.with Synaptic to Ununtu 14.10 My question is: \n\n\n*\n\n*Installation of Skype 4.3.0.37... with Synaptic to Ubuntu 14.10 - does Skype work OK with this installation ?\n\n*In my Synaptic screenshot I see now following packets of Skype programs. \nPacket:                               Last version:\nskype                                 4.3.0.37-OubuntuO..\npidgin-skype-dbg                      20130613+svn660+...\nemphaty-skype                         the same\npidgin skype                          the same\npidgin-skype-common                   the same\n\nAnd my question is:\n\n\n*\n\n*should I mark them ALL for installation or\n\n*only the first one (skype 4.3.0.37 ..) and other packets LATER, when Skype is already working OK?

The other packages are plugins for other chat applications (Pidgin and Empathy, in this case) to use Skype.\nIf you don't use Pidgin or Empathy, you won't gain anything by installing pidgin-* or empathy-*.\n", "Q: How to save the configurations made in Guest session?

I want to compress several images into a .xz archive. How do I do that?\n\nA: Use this command: tar cJf <archive.tar.xz> <files>. Separate file paths with a space.\n\nA: Use tar with -J option:\ntar -cvJf images.tar.xz /directory/containing/images/*\n\ntar is used to combine multiple files into one (Archive) and then we need to compress the archive using XZ compression algorithm.\nFrom man tar:\n-c, --create\n       create a new archive\n-v, --verbose\n       verbosely list files processed\n-J, --xz\n\n-f, --file ARCHIVE\n       use archive file or device ARCHIVE\n\nAlso note that images.tar.xz will be created in the current directory, if you want to save it somewhere else use /full/path/to/images.tar.xz.\n\nA: Although tar cJf archive files... as detailed by Zacharee1 and by heemayl is usually what you'll want to do, another way is to pipe tarred data to the xz command:\ntar c files... | xz > archive.tar.xz\nSince Ubuntu's tar supports the J option, this alternate way is specifically useful when you wish to pass options to xz.\nIn this example, I tar and xzip some TIFF files with a high level of compression (-9 to xz) and verbose output (v to tar, -v to xz):\nek@Io:~/Pictures$ tar vc *.tif{,f} | xz -9v > pics.tar.xz\npage001.tif\npage002.tif\npage003.tif\npage004.tif\npage9087.tif\npage3la.tiff\nquux0000.tiff\n  100 %       207.3 KiB / 290.0 KiB = 0.715\n\nThis could, of course, also be done in two explicitly separate steps:\nek@Io:~/Pictures$ tar vcf pics.tar *.tif{,f}\npage001.tif\npage002.tif\npage003.tif\npage004.tif\npage9087.tif\npage3la.tiff\nquux0000.tiff\nek@Io:~/Pictures$ xz -9v pics.tar\npics.tar (1/1)\n  100 %       207.3 KiB / 290.0 KiB = 0.715\n\nThose two ways are not actually equivalent in how they operate, though the .tar.xz files they produce in the end should be the same (and were, when I tested it).\n\n\n*\n\n*In the first, the output of tar is piped (|) to the input of xz. xz receives data from tar almost immediately, and no intermediate uncompressed tar file is ever created. This is to say that the first way is essentially equivalent to tar cJf archive files..., except for the additional arguments passed to xz.\n\n*In the second, an uncompressed tar archive is created by the first command, then compressed by xz in the second command. (xz automatically deletes the original file when it's done, unless invoked with -k/--keep.)\n\n\nFor further reading, see this post by Rafael van Horn and the tar and xz manpages.\n", "Q: Running a command in screen daemon mode I am trying to run a command in screen mode using the command\nscreen -dmS screen_name sed -i 's/a/b/'g some-file.txt\n\nNothing happens.

Or did you really install a proxy on the MAAS node on port 80?\nc) That all being said, I think you hit but https://bugs.launchpad.net/juju-core/+bug/1439447. After addressing the issues in (a) and (b), and if still doesn't work, can you try with an older juju-core, like 1.20.14, or maybe 1.23beta4 where it's supposed to be fixed?\n", "Q: Looking for a small fix to Ambiance themed Nautilus window! As you should see in the snapshot, at the edges of the Nautilus window (Ambiance and Radiance themes in Ubuntu 14.04.2) on the ends of the seam between the title bar and the one below it (don't know what you exactly call them), there are a few white pixels visible where the panel rounds up.\nI looked into the codes, but I didn't manage to find the fix. Can someone please help me with this?\n\n\nA: I had the same problem, I looked into the codes too (gtk-3 and unity folders in the Ambiance theme) but, at the end, the problem is related to themes associated with Ambiance (it's explained here). Steps to fix: \n\n\n*\n\n*Kill Nautilus (ALT+F2 killall nautilus)\n\n*Open Unity Tweak Tool\n\n*Select the Ambiance theme\n\n*Open Nautilus again\n\n", "Q: Problem installing Ubuntu on MacBook I have a macbook that cannot get past the startup splash and the spinning wheel under the Apple logo. \nedit bodhi.zazen - removed extra information.\n\nA: Burn Ubuntu to a USB drive, using whatever your favorite program is. Plug it into the Mac and hold the Option/ALT key to enter the built-in boot menu of the Mac. Select the USB drive and boot from it.\n", "Q: How can I preset aliases for all users? I have Ubuntu 14.04.2. I want to make it so all users automatically have a specific set of aliases. I have my aliases set in my personal .bashrc, but I don't want to have to manually copy them into the other users. Ideally it should automatically set these for newly created users as well.\n\nA: You can create a script in /etc/profile.d/ to make aliases for all users:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a file called 00-aliases.sh (or any other fancy name) in /etc/profile.d:\ngksu gedit /etc/profile.d/00-aliases.sh\n\n\n*Put you aliases in this file. Example:\nalias foo='bar --baz'\nalias baz='foo --bar'\n\n\n*Save the file\n\n*Restart any open terminals to apply the changes.\n\n*Enjoy!\n\n\n\nSome notes:\n\n\n*\n\n*/etc/profile is a global file that gets run before ~/.profile.\n\n*/etc/profile.d/ is a folder that contains scripts called by /etc/profile\n\n*When /etc/profile is called (when you start/login a shell), it searches for any files ending in .sh in /etc/profile.d/ and runs them  with one of these commands:\nsource /etc/profile.d/myfile.sh\n\n\n. /etc/profile.d/myfile.sh\n\n\n*I'm putting 00- before the file name to make it execute before the rest of the scripts.\n\n*You can also add your aliases in /etc/profile, but this isn't recommended.\n\n\nA: As pointed out here, it's probably better to add global aliases in     /etc/bash.bashrc:\nalias foo='bar --baz'\nalias baz='foo --bar'\n\n, because scripts in /etc/profile.d can be ignored for certain (non-login) shells. It took me hours to figure out why /etc/profile.d didn't work.\nSee e.g. https://askubuntu.com/a/606882/ and  Understanding .bashrc and .bash_profile for the distinction between shells.\n\nA: /etc/bashrc\n\n\n*\n\n*System wide functions and aliases\n\n*Environment stuff goes in /etc/profile\n\n\nIt's NOT a good idea to change this file unless you know what you\nare doing. It's much better to create a custom.sh shell script in /etc/profile.d/ to make custom changes to your environment, as this will prevent the need for merging in future updates.\n\nA: An alias will only work while inside of a shell. If you want something as widely accessible as an executable, you can add a small shortcut script to /usr/bin, e.g.:\n#!/bin/sh\nls -l \"$@\"\n\nThe \"$@\" passes all arguments through to the executable. The name of the script will be the name of the executable.\nSource: https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/52509/15954\n", "Q: Set wlan0 to Monitor Mode When setting wlan0 to monitor mode with \nsudo iwconfig wlan0 mode Monitor I get the following error:\nError for wireless request \"Set Mode\" (8B06) :\n    SET failed on device wlan0 ; Operation not supported.\n\nHow to resolve this?\n\nA: Broadcom Corporation BCM43225 802.11b/g/n (rev 01) doesn't support monitor mode on Linux.\n\nA: You could also try to start wlan0 in monitoring mode by\n\nairmon-ng start wlan0\n\n", "Q: Installation of Skype 4.3. xx.yy. to Ubuntu 14.10. 64 bit Thank you for many replies and great interest to this topic, but I would like to repeat my original question: Can I use without problems Synaptic for this installation. \nReason: I would like NOT to use terminal commands if possible with Skype installation. \nBackground: I have made last week installation with terminal commands by using the instructions / command shown above in answer ''Step 1, Step2, Step 3 ..'', but I made some mysterious misstake(s) and I greated somehow a ''SystemEror level problem'' (= in /etc/.. line 54 was lost for some reason ... -> SystemError warning) \nResult: I did not find any way / method / command to sort it out, than to REINSTALL the whole Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (Finish remix) once again -> then upgrade it to Ubuntu 14.10.. and, as you understand, it is not so nice excersice to repeat ....) \nConclusion: So, Synaptic may be a safe solution, if Skype 4.3. works OK in Ubuntu 14.10. with this skype 4.3.0.37-OubuntuO12.04.1 packet version. This packet version at present Synaptic offers me for installation. \n\nA: Start by opening the Software & Updates application, and tabbing to \"Other Software\". \nEnable the \"Canonical Partners\" check boxes.

However, I have no way to test the changes I make to this one so I was wondering if a simple script could be written to test the new $PS2?\n\nA: From man bash:\n   PS2    The value of this parameter is expanded as with PS1 and used  as\n          the secondary prompt string.  The default is ``> ''.\n\nThe \"secondary prompt string\" is what is shown when you have multi-line input. For example:\n$ echo 'foo\n>bar'\n\nThe > shown above is PS2. If I were to change that, I would see it as soon as I tried any multi-line command:\n$ PS2=\"%\"\n$ echo 'foo\n%bar'\n\nWays to run multi-line commands include:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open quotes (single or double) and hit enter without closing them.\n\n*Add a backslash to the end of a command and hit enter:\n$ echo foo \\\n>\n\n\n*Use a HEREDOC:\n$ echo <<<END  ## hit enter\n\nAs for doing it with a script, that's really not needed but you can simply write a script that prints PS2:\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\nprintf \"PS2 : %s\\n\" \"$PS2\"\n\n", "Q: why cant i download/install software (supported in windows) in linux operating system ubuntu \n*\n\n*Why cant I download/install software (supported in windows) in linux operating system ubuntu?\n\n*How to install software from internet?\n\n*How to install youwave/bluestacks/or any android os in linux os ubuntu?\n\n*How to install whatsapp on ubuntu?\n\n*why  can't I download applications/apps from any internet website?\n\n*I can't get any useful software such as android os/playback audio devices etc., in \"ubuntu softwaren center?\n\n*are there any inbuilt software in ubuntu?\n\n\nA: *\n\n*You can, but you have to realise that Ubuntu is very different from Windows.\nTherefore you cannot run applications designed for Windows directly on Ubuntu.

I installed Ubuntu 14.10 2-3 days back and it is experiencing high overheat problems. I am using a Dell XPS L502X PC with Nvidia graphics.

But unfortunately your devices is not listed there.\nBesides from that\nTo be honest, although it will be possible to achieve your goal, you might not be satfisfied with the performance once you get there.\n\n\n*\n\n*There is WAY TOO MUCH WLAN in there, making your routes very unstable and therefore slow\n\n*If one of your friends decides to stream or bit-torrent in your network it could make the bandwidth so small for veryone else, that it won't be fun to surf anymore. Maybe even collapsing the network.\nIf it's locationwise possible try to change from wifi to cable whenever possible.\nSo a much better set up would be (depending on the location of course).\nfriends --> WLAN ACCESS POINT --> connected to LAN CABLE --> UBUNTU router --> connected to LAN CABLE --> into LAN/WLAN router with ADSL or similar internet connector.\n\nThis would be the best for all people involved.

Just installed Ubuntu for the 1st time (ever!) on a Tosh Satellite L450D laptop - changing from Windows 7.\nInitial issues with Disk partitions overcome - I did a complete install from CD.

If some attackers compromised an ISO image of Ubuntu and replaced inner PGP keys , then I will not to able get & install security updates. Is it right?\nI'm asking it because I possible may meet the compromised OS and I heard that Ubuntu updates are PGP signed.\n\nA: Attack Vectors\nThe Ubuntu installer brings (equally to pretty much all other Linux distributions) a set of OpenPGP keys trusted by the package manager.\nGiven you download/get hold of a tampered ISO image, different things might happen based on what was changed.\n\n\n*\n\n*If the OpenPGP keys have been changed, you might either not be able to install updates any more (if the original ones have been dropped), and/or software from actually untrusted sources is trusted (when keys are added).\n\n*If apt's sources.list file was modified, one could also redirect to a location providing malicious updates (and signed with \"trusted\" keys, if these have been added, altough not Ubuntu's ones).\n\n*An attacker could have changed pretty much everything, including the actual verification of OpenPGP signatures or include arbitrary malware and backdoors. If the checksums are different, you don't know anything any more about the ISO image, and you couldn't reasonably verify what's wrong (but against another, untampered image).\n\n\nTo be sure about receiving a valid ISO image actually issued by Canonical, check against the SHA256 checksums provided on the download page, and if you have a trust path to Canonical's signing key, also verify the OpenPGP signature of that file.\nWhen ISO Image Checksums are Valid\nIf you make sure you have a trusted ISO image from the start, then everything's fine. If you're scared of man-in-the-middle-attacks while downloading from Canonical (like a three letter agency shipping a tampered file to you, and also modifying the checksum file), fetch the checksum file using different internet lines, to be very sure possibly even from public computers (they can't and/or wouldn't tamper it for everybody, as this likely would've been noticed by somebody).\nSHA256 is believed to be secure, if the checksum is right, everything's fine and nobody can either hide updates nor send you any malicious ones, as the whole package management chain is secured. The only thing they could do is a kind of denial of service attack, but you would realize that (as an error message would be printed).\n", "Q: How do i install zukitwo?

I've tried restarting the DHCP service, but to no avail.\nThanks!\n\nA: You can delete the /var/lib/dhcp/dhcp.leases file. A good time to do it would be just after a re-boot, before any clients obtain a lease.\nThe dhcpd server will try to re-use old leases as much as possible, and will use unused IP addresses from the pool before using even expired leases.

To do that, reimplement activate() method of your ActivationQueryBase in your ActivationQuery class; do whatever you need to update backend data in activate(), and then return ActivationResponse instance created with this ctor:\nActivationResponse(CannedQuery const& query);\nThe query argument should point to you scope.\nAn alternative approach for re-executing the search when a button in the preview is tapped is to set the uri attribute of the button with a value of CannedQuery::to_uri(), but in that case your activation handler is not executed.\nNote, with the first approach you are likely to experience https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/unity8/+bug/1335761\nI hope that helps.\n", "Q: How to uninstall crebs in Ubuntu 14.10 I recently installed crebs by downloading the source code and following the instructions and running setup.sh as root.

But these two settings gets reset on reboot and resume from suspend. How do I make these settings permanent until I toggle them?\n\nA: For both, if you are sure you don't want to use them you may be able blacklist the drivers of those pieces of hardware so they are not loaded on boot - blacklisting drivers is explained in full here. To determine the driver of the WiFi use lspci -k or lshw -C network, and blacklist the WiFi's driver module (You may also be able to do this with the 'Additional Drivers' GUI).\nThe (rather big) flaw with this method is what happens when you find you do need those pieces of hardware (particularly without a touchpad). You should be able to reload the modules using sudo modprobe MODULE in a TTY.\nIf you really never want to use that hardware, you could remove the driver packages, but this almost guarantees you will need them at a later date.You could also use rfkill and run it on boot similar to the method here.\nFor the touchpad this is more complicated with drivers, but you could use xinput to disable the touchpad:\nxinput --disable ID\n\nYou can determine the ID of the touchpad from xinput -list\nThis might not work system-wide from /etc/rc.local, so instead you could use ~/.profile so it disables the touchpad on login.\nAnother method may be to send the signal's the key's send, though this is probably very difficult as this probably is in the hardware not the software - this may help though.\n", "Q: GUI is not showing up after logging in I removed pulseaudio and alsa-base.

I recently got Terraria, and I'm playing it on my Ubuntu machine with PlayOnLinux. I just set it up with the nice little installer from PlayOnLinux. However, when I run it, the Wine desktop comes up in 1024x768, as well as Terraria. I've tried changing the resolution in terraria, but it stays the same size and the cursor movement is off. I have to Alt-F4 out because the cursor leaves the window before it gets to the settings button. I have also tried setting Terraria to fullscreen, but it's only fullscreen in the Wine desktop. I'm using a GTX 750 Ti.\n\nA: The first step is to get the Wine desktop the size you want. Once you have that setup, you'll probably have to go change the video settings in Terraria. If the settings look correct, but Terraria is still using the smaller window, toggle the windowed/fullscreen setting once or twice and then re-select the resolution.\nThe Terraria developers are supposed to release a native Linux client pretty soon now, so hopefully we won't need any more workarounds like this.\n", "Q: Problem running octave with openmpi in juju I am attempting to use openmpi from octave to start other octave instances on remote machines.

The MaaS controller is connected, for now, but will be disconnected in the future.  When I set up juju, i used a local repository , as in\njuju sync-tools -e maas --local-dir=\"~/.juju/sync-tools\"\njuju bootstrap -e mass --debug --upload-tools=true --metadata-source=\"~/.juju/sync-tools\" --to jujuBS.maas\njuju deploy --repository=\".juju/charms\" local:juju-gui --to 0\njuju expose juju-gui\n\nI used the same mechanism for the octave and octave-controller charms.  When I look at the unit....log files in /var/log/juju, on one of the nodes, I see many apts getting loaded.  These are stored somewhere, as the node has no access to the net.\nSome of these are loaded as the result of the charm loading, so it seems that either MaaS or juju is cognizant of the apt requirements for the charms.  I added some octave packages into the charm and the install, so that octave installed them, and all of a sudden there are required apts that are missing.  These apts are obviously required by the octave package (open-mpi was one, as it turns out).  I downloaded it, added it to the charm and install.  Now the MPI package loads in octave, but gives the status you see above.\n\nA: Short answer: you're in control; you can do what you like in the charm's install hook. The default is to use the main Ubuntu archive with MAAS's squid-deb-proxy acting as a proxy cache; there is no separate mirror or repository active.\n\nThe MaaS controller is connected, for now, but will be disconnected in the future.\n\nI think you're using squid-deb-proxy as supplied by MAAS, which caches packages but nothing more. By default this means that the environment your charm install hook sees is apt configured to use the squid-deb-proxy supplied by MAAS to download packages, but sources.list still pointing to the main Ubuntu archive. So your packages are coming from the Ubuntu archive via MAAS as a package cache.\nTo arrange to use a custom package instead, you want to modify your charms install hook to use it by reconfigure apt first. For example you could set up a PPA with your modified package and then arrange for your install hook to use it.\nYou can see a generic example of this in the implementation of the source charm configuration option in mariadb charm's config-changed hook. In the case of a custom charm that you don't need to be generic, you could just add a line like:\n sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:username/octave\n\nbefore you install the package in your install hook, or a suitable equivalent if your charm is written in a different language.\nIf you want to disconnect MAAS machine from Internet access, then you will need to implement your own local apt repository and then either arrange squid-deb-proxy on the MAAS machine to use it in favour of archive.ubuntu.com (assuming you have mirrored it), or otherwise arrange for your install hooks to configure apt to use it.\n", "Q: Install Ubuntu on a second internal drive So I have a second internal drive that I want to install Ubuntu 14.04 onto but it already has data on it that I don't want to mess with. How can I go about installing without affecting this data?\n\nA: Move the files someplace else and then install Ubuntu 14.04.\n\nA: Yes, there is a way to do what you want. Burn Ubuntu to a CD or USB drive and then boot from it. On the first screen, select Try Ubuntu. Open Unity Dash by clicking the Ubuntu logo at the top of the launcher and search Gparted. Here you can partition the other drive. You can just leave the free space as free space; the setup program will be able to format it correctly. Once you're done partitioning (don't forget to hit Apply) close Gparted and open the setup program again (second icon in the launcher).

In this case firefox and gedit. So if neither FF nor gedit is running the command will output 0. If one of them is running it will output 1. If both are running it will output 2.  \n\n*firefox &: Start firefox. & forces the process into the background.  \n\n*firefoxPid=$!: In a bash shell script $! holds the job number of the last background command. firefoxPid is a variable. So what's happening here is the job number of the last background command (which happens to be firefox's) is stored to a variable named firefoxPid.\n", "Q: Program to turn TouchPad On AND Off I have a ThinkPad Edge E520 and am running Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.\nI would like to have an executable file on my desktop which can easily turn on or off my TouchPad and TrackPoint:\nxinput list\n...\n⎜   ↳ TPPS/2 IBM TrackPoint                     id=15   [slave  pointer  (2)]\n⎜   ↳ SynPS/2 Synaptics TouchPad                id=13   [slave  pointer  (2)]\n\nThrough my own research I have created two files, one to turn it on, and one to turn it off.

You could as well use your xinput commands instead, but I prefer synclient.\nI'm using the following script, assigned to a hotkey, to toggle my touchpad on/off:\n#!/bin/bash\nif [ -z \"$(synclient | grep TouchpadOff | grep 1)\" ]; then\n    synclient TouchpadOff=1\nelse\n    synclient TouchpadOff=0\nfi\n\nHow does it work?\nWhen executing synclient without any arguments, it returns a list of all settings and their current state. From this list, the script greps the option \"TouchpadOff\", which is - who would've guessed it - 1 if the touchpad is off and 0 elsewise.\nTo check this, I used test's -z switch (following string empty), combined with another grep, which evaluates to true, if the touchpad is off. In this case, it again calls synclient with an argument telling it to set the option to \"1\", thereby disabling the touchpad.\nElsewise, the script does the opposite and reenables the touchpad.\n\nNote that synclient doesn't store settings permanently, so if you don't do anything else, your toucpad will always be enabled on boot.\n\nA: I'm using this script to switch the touchpad status.\n#!/bin/bash\nid=$(xinput | grep -i \"TouchPad\" | cut -f 2 | cut -d= -f 2)\nstatus=$(xinput --list-props $id | grep \"Device Enabled\" | cut -f 3)\nif [ $status -eq 1 ]; then\n    xinput --disable $id\nelse\n    xinput --enable $id\nfi\n\n\nA: I made a little script that you can try.

Something along the lines of launchscript ; %command% ; endscript perhaps.\nThis means we need a command line way to enable and disable the HUD hotkey. This answer shows a CLI method. I've tried this and it works from the terminal but not when I try to call it via the launch options within Steam. When trying it with bash -c I run into issues with the delimiters but that is solved using gsettings instead.\nI've tried all of the following but with no success:\ndconf write /org/compiz/integrated/show-hud '[\"\"]' ; primusrun %command%\nbash -c 'dconf write /org/compiz/integrated/show-hud '[\"\"]'' ; primusrun %command%\nbash -c 'dconf write /org/compiz/integrated/show-hud '[\"\"]' ; primusrun %command%'\nbash -c \"dconf write /org/compiz/integrated/show-hud '[\"\"]' ; primusrun %command%\"\nI've also tried using gsettings rather than dconf. \ne.g. bash -c 'gsettings set org.compiz.integrated show-hud '[\"\"]'' ; primusrun %command% but again it works in the terminal but not from the launch options. \nI'm pretty sure I'm just running into syntax problems, how can I get this to work properly?\n\nA: Make a script nohudrun like the primusrun is done:\n#!/bin/sh\n\nold_key=\"$(LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib dconf read /org/compiz/integrated/show-hud)\"\nLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib dconf write /org/compiz/integrated/show-hud \"['']\" \n\"$@\"\nLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib dconf write /org/compiz/integrated/show-hud \"$old_key\"\n\nAnd invoke it like that:\nnohudrun primusrun %command%\n\nLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib is for breaking from x32 environment of Steam, because dconf can't find x64 libs (maybe there is a better way). That is the cause why it fails from 'launch options', I think.\nYou can also add some locking to be able to correctly restore the keybinding when multiple games are run through that script.\nP. S. How to know what's wrong? Just print stderr to file:\ndconf write /org/compiz/integrated/show-hud \"['']\" 2>>/home/velkan/errr\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu Server 14.04.2 LTS Can someone guide me to a nice artice where I can like the list of things to consider if you want to strip all the unwanted processes/services in the server while its sole purpose is used as a web-server using Java, Tomcat and Mysql.\nwhen I do a \nps aux | wc -l\n\nI get 112. Want to make sure none of them are unwanted service and can be safely stopped (or not started while the server comes up)\n\nA: No, not really. What kind of unwanted processes is it you think are intentionally added to Ubuntu Server? It is designed to be a very basic system because it's intended for servers. So it doesn't run any services other than the ones you install. \nThere are of course a large number of great books you can read about Linux system administration, but you probably won't find many articles about \"things to remove after installing Ubuntu Server\". \nThe first hundred processes or so are related to the kernel and are critical. They enable your hardware or very low level system things that the kernel needs. These are in brackets [] and if you do a ps ax, you'll see that they represent almost all of your processes. There will be a few others, such as the init system (process 1), your login shell and things like that. \n", "Q: How to make a system monitoring in ubuntu-touch? I want to know a bit of system status in ubuntu-touch for cpu/ memory usage, but I don't know how to get something like the \"system monitor\" in ubuntu desktop.

I  tried make changes to the pc and winalt folders in /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/ but couldn't figure out the correct changes.\n\nA: You should change something in /usr/share/X11/xkb/keycodes/ instead. Find the file of your keyboard layout (mine is evdev) and then modify the file. The file contains the name of the keys and numbers that correspond to the key. You should only switch the numbers of the LCTL key and the LALT key. Don't forget to delete all .xkm files in the /var/lib/xkb/ directory and restart xorg.

MySQL Server 5.6 from the MySQL APT Repository requires libstdc++6 >=4.9 however MySQL Server 5.6 (mysql-server-5.6) from the default Ubuntu repositories requires libstdc++6 >=4.6. When you install the version of MySQL Server 5.6 (mysql-server-5.6) from the default Ubuntu repositories, it automatically resolves all the package dependencies for you.\nTo fix the problem you need to remove the MySQL APT Repository and then uninstall all the packages that you installed from the MySQL APT Repository. \nTo remove the MySQL APT Repository, use a command of the form:\nsudo dpkg --remove package-name\n\nwhere you replace package-name with the package name of the MySQL APT Repository you previously installed. Or else you can also search in the Ubuntu Software Center for the MySQL APT Repository .deb package that you installed and remove it from there.\nThen install the MySQL Server 5.6 with the command:  \nsudo apt install mysql-server-5.6\n\n\nA: Use \"aptitude\" to solve the problem.\nsudo apt-get install aptitude\nsudo aptitude remove mysql-apt-config\n\nNow follow the proposed solutions.\n\nA: \nlibstdc++6 : Depends: gcc-4.9-base (= 4.9.2-10) but 4.9.1-0ubuntu1 is installed\n\nThe package gcc-4.9-base (= 4.9.2-10) is only available for Ubuntu Vivid.\nCheck this (utopic) and this (vivid).\nRemove the package mysql-apt-config, installed by these instructions and use mysql-server to get the latest version.\nsudo dpkg --force-all -P mysql-apt-config\nsudo apt-get install mysql-server\n\n\nA: This error occurs because the package you are trying to download and install requires libstdc++6 >=4.9. The latest version of libstdc++6 available on the Ubuntu 14.04 LTS repositories is 4.8.2-19ubuntu1, which is older than 4.9.\nI'm assuming that you're running Ubuntu 14.04, because the libstdc++6 package on your computer is stuck at 4.8.2-19ubuntu1. The MySQL APT repository currently has packages for three versions of Ubuntu: 12.04, 14.04 and 14.10. The packages for 12.04 and 14.04 both require only libstdc++6 >=4.6, while 14.10 requires version libstdc++6 >=4.9.\nPlease check that you've installed the correct mysql-apt-config package for your Ubuntu version.\n", "Q: Backing up the whole (K)Ubuntu system There is a fault in the dedicated graphics card, and so my laptop is almost unusable. I am thinking of getting it fixed in the warranty. However the only problem is that Dell's complete care warranty means almost surely formatting the whole system before fixing the hardware issue. And that's undesirable because I have installed many softwares in KUbuntu 14.04 and customized it to a great extent.\nSo my question is, how do I take a complete backup of the Linux setup?  I have /root and /home on different partitions, and there's a separate partition for swap. There are also 3 other partitions, one of them for windows (I don't care much about it though, I hardly ever use it), and other for storing general purpose files. \nBy complete backup I mean I store it on an external hard disk drive, and restore the Linux setup to its current state after the graphics card problem is fixed by Dell under warranty.\nTl;dr: how do I take complete backup of KUbuntu 14.04 including all softwares and customization and restore it later?\nEdit: after the hardware fix, Dell will give my laptop in a factory condition, with only one partition of 500 GB, which has only windows in it. I'll manually restore the data in the remaining partitions, I'm just clueless about backing up and restoring Linux.\n\nA: Well the best way to do this is to make a 1:1 backup of the whole drive and save it.\nYou could use simply dd, but to be honest there is a much better way to achieve this.\nSimply use clonezilla, there is a live CD available you can use to copy one harddrive to another and even a restore option.\nLooking into this tool is definetly worth it.\nAll you need is a second hard drive.\nYou can get more information on clonezilla here\nUsing DD\nIf your partitions are small you can use dd to safe them and dd to restore them. But as in real life, size matters. While the new partition being bigger ain't a problem (you can correct this with tools), the partition being smaller then the original one will result in a broken partition.\nSo if you'd like to go that route, make sure that the partitions you create on your new machine are at least the wsame size. I'd recommend a little bit more (because some crappy tools use factor 1000 as a base to calculate the space, whereas the correct value would be 1024). \nYou can find a documentation for using dd on the ubuntu community help page\n", "Q: In Ubuntu 14.04 eclipse luna, eclipse juno and android studio is crashing every time?

You can try to follow these instructions: \nhttp://wiki.ubuntuusers.de/Java/Installation/Oracle_Java/Java_8\nHope it helps.\n", "Q: Can't boot windows 7 after reininstalling ubuntu 14.04 I had Windows 7 at first and i needed Ubuntu for some project , so dual booted windows 7 alongside Ubuntu and was working perfectly . Then ,got some issues with Ubuntu so reinstalled Ubuntu again . Installed grub Customizer , but windows didn't get detected . Now after referring some posts , i installed Boot Repair and this is the report i got http://paste.ubuntu.com/10837169/ .\np.s  I don't mind the OS, but want my data.\n\nA: According to the boot-repair log, it appears that your Windows partitions had been removed, probably when you reinstalled Ubuntu. \nAt this point, there's not much hope for your data, but there are a few options you can try, if you're using a HDD. Your chances decrease the more you write to the disk (e.g. booting up Ubuntu), so shut down your computer immediately and don't write to or boot from the HDD. You're probably also out of luck if you're using a SSD.\nYou might be able to retrieve some data using testdisk, or going to a data recovery service if you can afford it. In the future, make sure you keep backups, especially for important data. (The 3-2-1 rule is a good rule to go by: 3 copies, 2 different media, 1 offsite)\n\nA: Seems, GRUB is unable to Locate your Windows & Partition.\nI presume, that you are able to boot in Ubuntu, If so;\nHere's what you should do,\n\n\n*\n\n*Start Ubuntu\n\n*Open terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T)\n\n*Type the command sudo update-grub\n\n*Type your password when asked\n\n*You should see similar output\n\n  rawbot@rawbot-HP-Pavilion-dv4-Notebook-PC:~$ sudo update-grub\n    [sudo] password for tez: \n    Generating grub configuration file ...\n    Found background: /home/tez/Pictures/Anonymous.jpg\n    Found background image: /home/tez/Pictures/Anonymous.jpg\n    Found linux image: /boot/vmlinuz-3.16.0-34-generic\n    Found initrd image: /boot/initrd.img-3.16.0-34-generic\n    Found linux image: /boot/vmlinuz-3.16.0-33-generic\n    Found initrd image: /boot/initrd.img-3.16.0-33-generic\n    Found linux image: /boot/vmlinuz-3.16.0-31-generic\n    Found initrd image: /boot/initrd.img-3.16.0-31-generic\n    Found linux image: /boot/vmlinuz-3.16.0-23-generic\n    Found initrd image: /boot/initrd.img-3.16.0-23-generic\n    Found memtest86+ image: /boot/memtest86+.elf\n    Found memtest86+ image: /boot/memtest86+.bin\n    Found **Windows 7 (loader) on /dev/sda1**\n    done\n\n\n\n*You will find that a Windows Partition has been detected, Now you may Reboot\n\n*Now in GRUB Menu, you should be able to see Windows 7 in option list.\nHope this fixes your problem.

When I first installed Ubuntu dual-boot I would boot the computer and select Ubuntu 14.04, and a terminal would just flash with my username and take me to the logon screen, everything running smooth.\nYesterday I tried setting-up dual monitors on different graphics cards, one integrated and the other one being separate (GeForce GT 240) but it seems it didn't work out, the VGA cable was not working.\nAnyway, since then when I select Ubuntu on boot-up, a purple screeen shows up with terminal-font 'Ubuntu' in the center and stays there for seconds, then my logon screen flashes, screen goes dark for couple of seconds and it reappears and then everything goes back to normal.\nI don't understand what causes this, would it be the GUI startup? I'm afraid if it digs deep enough it could mess-up my whole GUI.\nDo you have the same change? Know what it is?\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: You don't need to worry that's normal grub loader interface, as far as for your login screen flash it is because Ubuntu machine is loading and reading files and blinks like flash, during that flash you sometimes see some commands running in background and same happens during shutdown.\nIn the sum of all you don't worry that's all normal.\n", "Q: Error while sharing a folder with domain admin account I am using ubuntu and windows server 2008 in a virtual box.

I \"solved it\" (really worked around it) by making sure that all windows start out maximized. This helps, because maximized windows that are bigger than the screen, show the scroll bars.  And, if you can access the scroll bars, you can thereby reach all parts of the window.\nTo do this, install CompizConfig Settings Manager, (which is kind of a scary program), and in Windows Rules, set the Maximized rule to class=.  This forces all new windows to come up maximized.\nI didn't figure this out myself... I think this may be where I got the answer from.  I am not sure why I used the 4th answer there - I was very new to Ubuntu then! But, perhaps just knowing that starting all windows maximized is a workaround can help you google up more info if you need it. \n\nA: I tried almost everything and still without success. But I discovered that my system uses Unity 2D. In the Unity 2D compiz does not work. It could discovered with this command:\nps ax | grep compiz\n\nOutput:\n4166 pts/0 S+ 0:00 grep --color=auto compiz\n\nIt means, that compiz does not run. If compiz runs, it will be like this:\n1401 ? Sl 2:29 compiz\n4166 pts/0 S+ 0:00 grep --color=auto compiz\n\nIn Unity 2D uses Metacity and this can be edited in gconf-editor. More information is here:\nHow do I configure Unity 2D?\nps ax | grep metacity\n1401 ? Sl 2:29 metacity\n4166 pts/0 S+ 0:00 grep --color=auto metacity\n\nSo now I have to set fullscreen rule (or maximize) only for \"system settings\" window. Right now I do not how..

Something like: https://gfx.io/?\n\nA: If you have nvidia prime installed just go to nvidia x server settings and choose it in prime profile (you need to relog to apply the changes).\n\nTo install prime:\nFirst make sure bumblebee not installed! Or just remove it:\nsudo apt-get purge bumblebee*\n\nInstall:\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-prime\n\nYou can also install prime-indicator for easier switching.\n\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:nilarimogard/webupd8\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install prime-indicator\n\nIf you prefer to use bumblebee/have it installed you have to run the application with a command to use the video card (advantage: you don't need to relog).\noptirun <program-name>\n\nTo install bumblebee make sure you remove prime!\nMore info: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Bumblebee\n", "Q: Can't switch back to German I switched my Ubuntu with gnome-language-selector to English.

Maybe you still have old boot settings, or just the name is incorrect. If so, just edit them (make sure you don't delete the correct one as it will make booting issues).\nIf you never had windows 8 installed, you don't have to worry about the fact it is identified as windows 8 as what's important for Grub is that the path is correct.\n", "Q: php-fpm changed user can't create pid and sock files I want to execute php-fpm with a different user in my Ubuntu workstation, so I changed the /etc/php5/fpm/pool.d file according to some tutorials I found:\nuser = myuser\ngroup = myuser\n\nBut when I try to restart php-fpm service, it crashes because my new user doesn't have permissions to create the pid and sock files under /var/run what totally makes sense since /var/run has root only permissions.

I have a 32GB Sony Microvault USB pendrive which is USB 3.0.\nWhen I try to connect it, it isn't yet being shown in the device. I want to make it work without formatting the drive to USB 2.0 and use it in the regular USB 3.0 speed.\nHow to do this? I want to make it work in my PC.\n\nA: First of all, USB 3.0 is a communication/plug/cable standard and no file system, so you can't \"format\" anything to USB 3.0 or USB 2.0!\nFurthermore, the data transfer rate always depends on the slowest device in the connection. So no matter if you use a 3.0 device on a 2.0 port or a 2.0 device on a 3.0 port or even both 3.0 device and port, but with a 2.0 hub in between, you always only get 2.0 speed.\nNow a 3.0 USB port should be downwards-compatible with other devices and recognize even 1.1 drives, but the other way round that could be a problem. A 2.0 port does not automatically have to recognize 3.0 devices, unless they offer a compatibility feature (written on the packaging, something like \"USB 2.0 compatible\" - most devices have this). You could check whether your drive offers such a feature or not.\n\nTo troubleshoot not recognized USB devices in general, you check the lsusb output before plugging in the device, wait a minute (!) and then check the lsusb output again. The interesting thing is whether any additional lines showed up.  \nIf nothing changes after you plugged in the device, it is not recognized as USB device, but maybe the kernel could at least detect it in any way. To check this, first clear the kernel message buffer with sudo dmesg --clear. Then plug in the USB device, wait a minute (!) and check the output of dmesg. Anything related to USB is interesting for your problem and might highlight the cause why it is not recognized properly. If you see no interesting line even there, I would have to say I see no more hope for your device on that machine...\n", "Q: Automatically connect to internet I have Ubuntu 14.04 LTS installed on my laptop, I am using 3G USB modem to connect to the internet (sometimes I do not have direct access to this laptop, but I need it to stay online). But every day or two it keeps disconnecting from this network. I was wondering, is there any way to set the system to connect automatically at specific time?\n\nA: You can use nmcli and cron to bringing up connection at specific time.\nFirst you create connection using Network-Manager.\nThen start terminal to test some things\n\n\n*\n\n*list all NM connections: nmcli con\n\n*start connection: nmcli con up id ConnectionName\n\n*down connection: nmcli con down id ConnectionName\nIf work, setup cron to trigger connection  \nsudo crontab -e\nat the end add\n45 10 * * * nmcli con up id bdc\n\nthis will trigger command every day at 10 h and 45 min.\nIn cron you can specify min, hour, day, month ...\nAlso you can start connectio every min \n* * * * * nmcli con up id bdc\n\nMore example how to setup time in cron can find here\n", "Q: How to install Jahshaka?

There is an article (https://github.com/lopaka/instructions/blob/master/ubuntu-14.10-install-asus-x205ta.md) that describes the installation and issues with wireless and sound drivers but that is around 5 months old. \nHas anyone been able to run Ubuntu (or any other distro) that fully recognizes the hardware on this device?\n\nA: I'm running Ubuntu 14.10 on my X205TA. Right now the major gripe for me is that audio doesn't work. I would recommend that you do get the laptop if you're okay with using Windows for a while. It is a really good laptop for the price.\nI followed instructions from the following pages\n\n*\n\n*https://github.com/lopaka/instructions/blob/master/ubuntu-14.10-install-asus-x205ta.md\n\n*https://wiki.debian.org/InstallingDebianOn/Asus/X205TA\nWhat works for me right now\n\n*\n\n*WiFi - Installed the latest linux 4.0 kernel and then followed instructions from the debian page.\n\n*Battery Meter - Works out of the box once you install the linux 4.0 kernel.\n\n*Brightness works if you add the boot flag acpi=force to grub.\n\nBefore getting the inbuilt WiFi fixed, I used my android phone to connect to my WiFi using USB tethering. That helped in following all the instructions and not having to juggle files from my desktop to this laptop.\nPlease make sure you don't wipe your entire drive, since you need some files from the windows partition to get WiFi to work.\n\nA: I recently installed ubuntu 18.04 MATE on my ASUS X205TA, and it was quite a hassle!\nFinding a bootable image was time consuming, as (i learned) the X205TA has a strange UEFI BIOS (32 bit)that requires a file bootia32.efi, just to boot from USB.\nOnboard WiFi did not work in the beginning, so i plugged in a USB-Wifi Adapter, that was recognized, then the installation worked. Without this USB WiFi, the installation failed when installing Grub!\nAfter that i installed Broadcom drivers, then also onboard Wifi was recognized and worked ok!\nThanks to harryharryharry, who did a phantastic job and provided several Linux isos for the X205TA.\nSo, now Ubuntu 18.04 works with Sound and Wifi, BUT:\n- Sound on LineOut is not working yet\n- Hibernate is still not working\n- Function keys do not work\nBut still, the x205ta is a nice Netbook with Ubuntu, its a pitty that ASUS offically is not support Linux, as they state by themselves....\nHope that helps!\n", "Q: Install Ubuntu 14.04 LTS with an already existing encrypted home The issue is to upgrade a Ubuntu system mounted with an encrypted home (on a seperated partition) which then cannot be decrypted/mounted with the exact same passphrase on a new fresh installed Ubuntu. This question has already been answered but \"solved\" (?) in a \"non-deterministic\" way in 602360/345970. I cannot afford keeping reinstalling Ubuntu again and again...\nI currently have a Ubuntu 12.04 that I cannot upgrade (via do-release-upgrade) due to package errors. Hence, I decided to make a fresh install of latest LTS Ubuntu 14.04. The system / directory (~50GB) is mounted on sda6 and yet the encrypted home /home is on sda7 (~145GB). I formatted and installed the new Ubuntu on sda6 and specified sda7 to be considered as a mount-point for /home.\nAfter the install asked for a login/password (which I entered as the exact same as previous installs), I tried to log in. However, there appears that Ubuntu cannot decrypt/mount my data and shows the following \n\nSignature not found in user keyring\nPerhaps try the interactive 'ecryptfs-mount-private'\n\nMorevoer, when I try ecryptfs-mount-private, it asks for the login passphrase which I correctly entered for a dozen times but an error appears claiming that the password is incorrect. I rolled back to Ubuntu 12.04 with a partition backup and checked again that the password was indeed correct.\nHereafter, I discuss related issues that are not relevant to this one or left unanswered:\n\n\n*\n\n*115497/345970: ecryptfs-mount-private is not an appropriate solution. Even if, my data is correctly decrypted, it requires me to allocate twice + 3/5 of the current home directory space disk to first decrypt and copy and then re-encrypt.\n\n*129906/345970: Issue not answered but possibly the same (up to operating system version)\n\n*182078/345970: Not related to the question of re-installing an operating system.\n\n*286828/345970: Same issue but remained unaswered.\n\n*341302/345970: My login passphrase is the same as the UNIX user password. Different issue.\n\n*476037/345970: I'm not using LVM. In any case, that question was left unanswered.\n\n*485625/345970: I'm not using different user login names.\n\n*584656/345970: Same issue. No appropriate answer.\n\n*602360/345970: As said earlier, \"solved\" in a random/non-deterministic way, by re-installing again and again Ubuntu until reaching a match.\n\n\nA: It is really simpler than you think. All you have to do is that when installing the Ubuntu, you will see a page in the installation wizard called user settings. There you will fill up your system password and usernames. So down there you can see a check box says Encrypt my Home folder also\nAll you have to do is that to check mark it and proceed as usual. It is easy to do.\n", "Q: How to make and application for Ubuntu phone OS in QT creator? I want to develop and application for Ubuntu Phone os. How to do this in QT creator?

About once a day the entire application will either become totally unresponsive, or alternatively it continues to work, but repaints of the UI stop happening (clicking on different tabs changes the title of the window, but the page remains the same).\nHas anybody experienced these issues and found any ways to improve the stability? I install all the updates as they come in, so any other suggestions would be appreciated.\n\nA: A reply to an earlier version of this question suggested pressing Shift-Esc while in Chrome, which brings up a Chrome Task Manager window, and ending all processes except the Browser itself and the GPU Process. \nI tried this, and it worked for me. The results imply that one of those processes is causing the problem, and my guess would be that a third-party developer hasn't properly tested its product in the Ubuntu Linux environment, and probably the product is not \"well behaved\" according to Google's rules for developing Chrome Extensions. \nEnding tasks leaves them ended until you go back into the menu for Extensions and reactivate them. I don't have time to add extensions back systematically to identify which causes the problem. Some of my extensions needed deleting anyway, but I will systematically add those I need back one by one, and if I find an extension that brings the problem back, I'll post that information here.\n", "Q: Can ~/.local/share/applications override /usr/share/applications? I need to launch some applications on KDE with some added config changes. The best way to do that without messing up with / is by copying .desktop file of individual applications, that I need to change config of, from /usr/share/applications, add options, and then copy them to ~/.local/share/applications. \nI was wondering if that is going to cause any problems that I am not aware of. And if there is a better way to do that say by not copying everything but only adding a changes in the desktop file in ~/.local/share/applications.\nThanks.\n\nA: Don't copy all files/directories from  /usr/share/applications\nIt is indeed good practice to copy a .desktop file locally before editing it. That is the appropriate procedure.  After you copied/edited it and logged out/in, the local one will overrule the global one.\nNot all files in /usr/share/applications are meant to be run by the user directly however. Some files possibly are no .desktop files at all and even a few directories may exist. That is (a.o.) why you should not simply copy everything from /usr/share/applications into ~/.local/share/applications.\nThere is also no reason at all to copy all .desktop files locally. The local ones will only overrule the global ones if the local one exists. If the local one does not exist, the global one still is \"in charge\".\nIs there a risk if I copy the complete contents of /usr/share/applications to ~/.local/share/applications?\nApart from creating useless duplicates, copying everything from /usr/share/applications can cause conflicts starting up your desktop. I actually did that once as an experiment (Unity), had to fix things with a startup usb.\nConclusion:\nOnly copy global .desktop files to ~/.local/share/applications if you have a reason to do that, and only copy (and edit) files specifically.\nIf you mess up a .desktop file somehow, the application won't startup from Dash or you are experiencing duplicate icons in Dash, if you do not manage to fix, simply remove the local .desktop, log out/in and things are as they were before.\n\nA: Yes it should work to copy the ones you want to modify to ~/.local/share/applications, and shouldn't cause too many problems unless you make some bad edits (e.g. removing mime-types etc). Copying all the ones mean that if they are updated at /usr/share/applications, they won;t be updated in ~/.local/share/applications, and the launchers for apps you remove will remain. Don't bother copying all of them that is unnecessary. \nAfter you make the edits, running update-desktop-database ~/.local/share/applications/ should make sure the new launcher is recognised, so is shown in the Dash/Menu.\nUnity's launcher, and probably Gnome's Dash will likely still show the version in /usr/share/applications, so you will need to unlock and lock the icon. Gnome 3 may also need a restart, Nautilus may do as well so logging out and logging back in should fix this.\nReading the following may help with making edits:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://standards.freedesktop.org/desktop-entry-spec/latest/\n\n*https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Desktop_entries\n", "Q: Can't start program without using sudo I have monodevelop 5.7 installed on my computer with ubuntu 14.10, but when I tried run it from launcher and from the command \n~$ monodevelop\n\nthey didn't work.\nBut when I used the command\n~$ sudo monodevelop\n\nit worked ok, monodevelop started.\nHow can I run monodevelop from launcher and command line without using sudo?\nThanks a lot for help.\n\nA: First of all look for permission-related errors with: strace monodevelop.\nIf you found it, change the permissions to that files/directories to match your user.

WHy?\nI tried export http_proxy=[the proxy ip]:8080 on terminal, trying to connect Internet via my terminal, but it doesnt work. \n\nA: I guess you are looking for system wide proxy.\nEdit the following file:\nsudo nano /etc/environment\n\nSet/Add: http_proxy=\"http://yourproxyserver:8080\" (if you have password \"http://user_name:password@yourproxyserver.com:8080/\")\nSame for https_proxy, ftp_proxy etc.\nIf you want exceptions (e.g. you want to use your localhost server): no_proxy=\"localhost,127.0.0.1\"\nYou need to restart to apply changes.\nIf you want to apply it for apt-get and some other tools, check this tutorial:\nHow do I set systemwide proxy servers in Xubuntu, Lubuntu or Ubuntu Studio?\n", "Q: CompizConfig : Fire animation not found even after install compiz-extras I am using ubuntu 14.04 on my pc and I have installed the necessary compiz plugins to get animations running such as compiz-plugins-extra,compiz-plugins, but I am unable to find 'Fire' animation for closing a window. \nI checked on net, and 1 or 2 people had the same question, but no solution mentioned works. \nI have other animations, but not the 'Fire' one, does anyone know how to install it. \nKindly let me know. Thanks a lot. :-)\n\nA: The burn animation is part of a plugin called Animation Addon. Since Compiz 0.9.8, that plugin has been disabled in the Compiz build system to complete OpenGL ES support, meaning that when Compiz is built, it's built without that particular plugin. For that reason, you won't find it in any recent packages.\nIf you build Compiz from source, you can edit the plugins/CMakeLists.txt file and change \n\nset (COMPIZ_DISABLE_PLUGIN_ANIMATIONADDON ON) \n\nto \n\nset (COMPIZ_DISABLE_PLUGIN_ANIMATIONADDON OFF)\n\nBut it won't do you any good as the build will fail. \nI suppose you could try cannibalising the required files from an old compiz-plugins-extra binary: http://packages.ubuntu.com/precise/x11/compiz-plugins-extra\nI've no idea whether that will work or not but it might be worth messing around with if you really want that plugin.\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: Change trash icon command in Unity I have recently replaced my default file manger from Nautilus to Dolphin, so I would like when I click on the trash icon (in left narrow panel), Dolphin opens trash folder not Nautilus. For this I've set Dolphin as the default file manger.\nNow, when I click on the trash icon, Dolphin opens and shows a message saying \nMalformed URL trash://\n\nApparently clicking on the trash icon causes a command to run. But in Dolphin URL trash:/ works fine.\nHow can I change the command that runs when user clicks on the trash icon? I should replace trash:// to trash:/ there.\n\nA: Looks like it's a bug related to Dolphin with a fix on the way.  https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=353181\n", "Q: Terminal unusable in Virtual Machine I am using Ubuntu 14.04 and I have created a virtual machine with the same ISO. In the virtual machine the terminal window shows up with a strange transparent gradient that makes it unusable. How can I fix this?\n\n\nA: The default video driver for KVM/qemu libvirt type VMs is the cirrus driver and that is the root issue. Years ago, there were problems with the vmvga driver, and cirrus was made the default. Issues with the vmvga driver have long since been fixed.\nFor a new VM defintion, specify the vmvga driver.\nTo fix an existing VM then use virsh edit and change this line:\n<model type='cirrus' vram='9216' heads='1'/>\n\nto this:\n<model type='vmvga' vram='9216' heads='1'/>\n\nIf the VM name is, for example, desk_tt then the defintion file will be /etc/libvirt/qemu/desk_tt.xml. Myself, I make a copy before changing things.\nsudo cp desk_tt.xml desk_tt.xml.original\n\nthen, and you MUST use virsh edit do NOT edit the file directly, as virsh edit will do a bunch of checks upon save and exit. From any directory do:\nvirsh edit desk_tt\n\nThere is probably a way to make the change using virt-manager, but I do not use it, and so do not know how.\nNote: the default editor used by virsh edit is as defined by the $EDITOR environment variable, or VI if it does not exist. add export EDITOR=\"/bin/nano\" to your ~/.bashrc file to set, for example, nano as your default editor.\nNote: Readers might be tempted to increase the video ram, vram, in the above line, as depending on your screen size it probably isn't enough. At the time of posting this answer, the vram parmeter is ignored.\n\nA: The driver type can also be edited from the menu on the virtual machine terminal: View > Details > Video Cirrus\nI selected VMVGA for the model, restarted the virtual machine and my terminals were no longer suffering from a transparent background.\n", "Q: SSH and SFTP Permission Setup I'm trying to setup SFTP on my ubuntu server and I'm encountering a problem. When I set up a group in sshd_config file to chroot people to their home directories the user in the group cannot access the server via SSH and this error comes up \"software caused connection abort\" and sometimes \"No directory found\". \nI'm pretty sure it is to do with permissions but I'm not sure what.

If neither of these was done, SSH won't be able to login the user.\n\nA: The directory you are chrooting (in your case %h) should be owned by user root. Use command sudo chown root.root %h\n", "Q: broken packages error while trying to install xserver-xorg-input-mtrack I'm new to Linux and I'm a mac user.

The file I want is downloaded from web-site that I have to authenticate on - which is why I decided to use lynx. Which happens to work for files of a size lower than approx. 1 GB. But the file I would like to download is about 8 GB. Here's what I do:\nI switch onto a mounted EBS disk which happens to provide 47GB of free space:\nubuntu@ip-...:~/data$ df -h                                                                                                 \nFilesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on\n...\n/dev/xvdf        50G   52M   47G   1% /home/ubuntu/data\n\nThe owner is my working account:\nubuntu@ip-...:~$ ls -la \ntotal 22608\n...\ndrwxr-xr-x  3 ubuntu ubuntu     4096 Apr 17 13:37 data\n...\n\nMy current working directory is the root folder of that disk:\nubuntu@ip-...:~/data$ echo $PWD\n/home/ubuntu/data\n\nSo, I fire up lynx, authenticate on the web-site and initiate the download - which seems to work fine - as I can follow the progress. But as soon as Lynx hits about more or less 1 GB of downloaded data I get an error message and lynx crashes:\nAlert!: HTFWriter_write: FileWriter: No space left on device\n\nAny ideas how to resolve or further troubleshoot this issue?\n\nA: Apparently the folder where Lynx would store temporarily the downloaded file was located on the main disk somewhere - which happens to be significantly smaller.\nThe solution is to set LYNX_TEMP_SPACE to a folder on a larger disk.\nexport LYNX_TEMP_SPACE=~/data/tmp\n\n", "Q: How do I share a directory between an LXC container and the host? How can I share a folder between the host system (ubuntu 14.04) and an ubuntu lxc container?\nI tried mounting the folder on the host:\nsudo mount --bind /media/data/share /media/data/container/name/rootfs/share\n\nbut I can't see any files.\nThe same goes for:\nsudo ln -s /media/data/share /media/data/container/name/rootfs/share\n\nDo I need to change permissions for the share folder?\n\nA: Below is what I have done to mount one of my host directory to the container. This is trickier than it sounds because we would like to achieve\n\n\n*\n\n*Inside the container we should be able to write to the directory.\n\n*Outside the container we should be able to write to the files and directories created inside the container.\n\n\nAfter reading various articles online (the most helpful one is this github issue), here is how I solve this. The trick is to map the uid and gid of the host user to the uid and gid of the user inside the container.\nSuppose I am going to mount /home/breakds/projects to the exact same location in the container. The outside directory is owned by the user breakds, whose uid and gid are 1000.\nI then created an user in the container called debian, whose uid and gid happened to be 1000 as well (because it is the first non root user). I will then create an (lxc) profie on the host by\nlxc profile edit breakds\n\nAnd below is the content of the profile (I believe it is in yaml format):\nname: breakds\nconfig:\n    raw.lxc: |\n        lxc.id_map =\n        lxc.id_map = u 0 165536 999\n        lxc.id_map = g 0 165536 999\n        lxc.id_map = u 1000 1000 1\n        lxc.id_map = g 1000 1000 1\n        lxc.id_map = u 1001 166537 64535\n        lxc.id_map = g 1001 166537 64535\n    user.vendor-data: |\n        packages:\n            - bash\ndescription: allow home dir mounting for breakds\ndevices:\neth0:\n    name: eth0\n    nictype: bridged\n    parent: lxdbr0\n    type: nic\nprojects:\n    path: /home/breakds/projects\n    source: /home/debian/projects\n    type: disk\n\nThen, apply this profile to that container permanently:\n$ lxc profile apply <my container> breakds\n\nThis should do the trick.\nNOTE: Please note that before switching to this profile, make sure that all direcotries or files whose owner/group is debian should be deleted (and probably recreated after the switch). This is because after the uid and gid mapping, their ownership will become invalid. I originally thought since I am just mapping 1000 to 1000 everything should be fine, but I think I missed something here and it would be great if some one can advice on how to resolve this without the hack.\n\nA: According to the LXC documentation you can do this via a privileged container: \nlxc launch ubuntu priv -c security.privileged=true\nlxc config device add priv homedir disk source=/home/$USER path=/home/ubuntu\n\n\nA: I found an article in the openSUSE wiki: https://en.opensuse.org/User:Tsu2/LXC_mount_shared_directory\nI followed the steps and it works now.\nCreate host directory:\nmkdir /media/data/share && chmod 7777 /media/data/share\n\nCreate directory in lxc container:\nmkdir /share\n\nEdit lxc config file on host:\nnano /var/lib/lxc/containername/config\nlxc.mount.entry = /media/data/share share none ro,bind 0.0\n\n\nA: You can also do this without LXD by editing the LXC config file directly:\n# Container specific configuration\nlxc.idmap = u 0 165536 1000\nlxc.idmap = g 0 165536 1000\nlxc.idmap = u 1000 1000 1\nlxc.idmap = g 1000 1000 1\nlxc.idmap = u 1001 166536 64535\nlxc.idmap = g 1001 166536 64535\n\nYou also have to make sure that the container's user's account is given permission to map to uid/gid 1000 on the host by editing /etc/subuid and /etc/subgid:\ncontaineruser:165536:65536\ncontaineruser:1000:1\n\n", "Q: Unable to install MPlayer on ubuntu Linux 3.2.0-76-generic I am trying to install MPlayer on my Ubuntu system but every time I am getting following text on terminal:\n\"Install these packages without verification [y/N]?
