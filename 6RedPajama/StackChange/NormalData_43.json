["Q: iPhone shows OS X Handoff of a device I want to remove A month ago i had two user accounts on my MacBook (pro), both was setup to get text messages from my iPhone. Now I have removed one of the user accounts, but in settings on my iPhone I can still chose the old mac user for text forwarding.  \nMy question is: Can i remove the old device from the list below?  \n\n\nA: Handoff is keyed to your iCloud account, so you might want to sign in to https://www.icloud.com/#settings and see if that Mac is still listed. \nIf so, there are links to what to do if the device is \"lost, sold, gave away this device\"\nIn a nutshell, sign out of iCloud entirely on that Mac. If that doesn't work, you can send a remote erase to that Mac which will erase everything on it - not just the Apple ID / iCloud settings.\nOnce you've ruled that out, you might need to sign out of iCloud on your iPhone, but I've usually been able to clean thing up from the Mac end of thing when I find unwanted entries like you have.\nIn your case overloading two user accounts and deleting one before signing out may have confused the registration. Can you restore that user account from a backup and sign out? If not, worst case is you might need to sign out from both (or even all) accounts on that Mac to remove the machine record from the cloud database.\n", "Q: Setting default \"Spaces\" arrangement in El Capitan I like certain apps to have their own dedicated spaces, and I'm wondering how I can make it so those apps are automatically arranged in a specific order in Mission Control upon being opened. For example, here's an arrangement I have on my laptop screen:\n\nSpotify on the left far left, and Mailbox on the far right.\nI've used a tiling window managers on Arch Linux called i3, and this automated arranging was very easy to do. I don't expect the same level of customization on OS X, but if there was some way to retain my arrangement without having to manually move these spaces around every time, that would be fantastic.\n\nA: The whole thing is much easier to manage if you don't use the system full-screen, which will always set a full-screen app to the right of any existing Spaces & they cannot then be accessed by the standard  Ctrl ⌃   num  method\nIf you don't full-screen, then you can quickly lock any app to a Space by right-clicking in the Dock.\nAlso, make sure you don't have it set to rearrange Spaces automatically in System Prefs > Mission Control.\nSee my answer at https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/179403/85275 for some more working methods.\n", "Q: Can't modify selection of \"use cellular data for\" for some apps in iPhone 6 after update to iOS 9 After update to iOS 9, for many of the apps in my iPhone 6, the \"cellular data\" selection is locked in \"Settings/Cellular/Use Cellular Data For\" or in the corresponding \"Settings/[App Name]\" entry. The toggle can be flipped but the new value is not stored when exiting Settings. If the value reverts to off, the app can't access the cellular data network. The apps with the value reverting to on, can. Cellular Data and Data Roaming are on. All apps have the most recent updates.\nI've tried toggling \"Airplane Mode,\" \"Cellular Data\", turning off the iPhone, resetting \"All Settings,\" loading a previous back-up, and restoring the phone. Nothing seems to work. \nPlease help!\n\nA: There's been a bug with iOS since iOS 7 where the CellularData.db can become corrupted. Once the file has a problem, the Settings app can't save changes to it and there's no easy way to wipe just that file and start over.\nThis file is saved as part of the backup process and then restored, still broken, when you restore from backup. \nNow that a jailbreak is available for iOS 9, you can manually delete the CellularData.db to reset it which avoids the need to restore the device (and not restore from backup) which is an alternative.\n\nA: Deleting CellularUsage.db does not work in this case. The only way I have found it to work is the not restore from backup option.\n", "Q: iTunes Store vs App Store (iPhone 4) Why are some apps installed via iTunes Store while others via App Store? is there any significance in that? Many thanks.\n\nA: You're confused because on Mac, you access iOS App Store from iTunes, but it is actually iOS App Store. So all your apps are from iOS App Store, not the Mac App Store which is a separate App like iOS App Store is separate on iDevices than iTunes.\n\nA: No apps are installed via the iTunes Store. The iTunes Store is for music, movies, TV shows, etc. All apps are in the App Store.\n", "Q: how can i get imessages that i missed when imessage was off? My imessage button was turned off for a week and I am concerned that I missed a lot of important messages. How can I get those messages to come through now?\n\nA: They should automatically appear after you turn iMessage back on.\n", "Q: How to Change iPhone between Silent and Vibrate I have an iPhone 5s and I only like to use silent and vibrate.  I never use the sound.  Is there a way that I can assign the switch on the side of the phone to be either silent or on vibrate?  I don't mind using the volume buttons on the side either, like i did when i had android, but i noticed that apple doesn't easily let you use move between vibrate and silent without going into the settings menu.  Thanks in advance.\n\nA: If you set the phone to not vibrate on ring, but vibrate on silent, then you could swap your ringtone for one that makes no sound.\nYou'd have to repeat that for each notification type below, if you wanted nothing at all to make a sound.\nI made my own, but Google has a lot of results if you search for 'silent ringtone'\nThe side switch will then swap between silent [on] & vibrate [off]\n\n\nA: No, it isn't possible to change that in iOS. However, Apple's \"silent\" mode would be Do Not Disturb, which can be accessed in Control Center. \nSo as an alternative to the side switch, you can make sure that Control Center is enabled in the lock screen and then simply swipe up from the bottom and tap the moon icon. It isn't as convenient as the hardware switch, but certainly much better than opening Settings. \nAlso, some videos (in certain apps), for example, require that the switch on the side of the phone is On, so you might need to toggle it every now any then anyway. \n", "Q: Does an iCloud restore on iPhone overwrite iTunes contacts/calendar etc? If I sync my iPhone contacts, notes, calendar etc with iTunes and then restore my phone using iCloud, then sync again, will my iTunes contacts be overwritten by the restored version? Will my iPhone contacts have the iCloud version of my contacts, the iTunes version or some merge?\n\nA: iTunes doesn't sync Calendar & Contacts unless iCloud [over-the-air] sync is off, so there is nothing to merge.\n\n\n", "Q: Load a locale from /usr/local/share/locale in OS X While importing a PostgreSQL database in OS X 10.10, I got a error like \"invalid locale name: en_US.utf8\". I went to /usr/share/locale and copied the folder en_US.UTF-8 as en_US.utf8. Ok, problem solved.\nBut I know this solution will not work in OS X 10.11 due to that \"rootless mode\". I'll not be able to modify /usr/share/locale.\nIs there any way to load this folder from /usr/local/share/locale? I tried to copy en_US.utf8 to that directory and it didn't work.\n\nA: This worked for me (macos 10.14):\nsudo localedef -i /usr/share/locale/en_US.UTF-8 /usr/local/share/locale/en_US.utf8\nsudo cp /usr/share/locale/en_US.UTF-8/LC_COLLATE /usr/local/share/locale/en_US.utf8/\n\n\nA: My solution now is to simply replace the string \"en_US.utf8\" with \"en_US.UTF-8\" in the dump file. Since that file is compressed in my case (hence binary format), it was necessary to keep the same number of characters in the original line. So I remove a couple of white-spaces, transforming\n(...) LC_COLLATE = 'en_US.utf8' LC_CTYPE = 'en_US.utf8' (...)\n\ninto\n(...) LC_COLLATE= 'en_US.UTF-8' LC_CTYPE= 'en_US.UTF-8' (...)\n\nA perl command to do that in my importing script was\nperl -pi -e \"s/LC_COLLATE = 'en_US.utf8'/LC_COLLATE= 'en_US.UTF-8'/g\" myDumpFilePath\nperl -pi -e \"s/LC_CTYPE = 'en_US.utf8'/LC_CTYPE= 'en_US.UTF-8'/g\" myDumpFilePath\n\n", "Q: In iOS 9, where is the \"Usage\" function in Settings? In iOS8's Settings page, I used to be able to go to \"General\" then \"Usage\" and it would tell me how much free space is available on the device, and how much space each app uses.\nWhere is this now in iOS9?\n\nA: It has moved to a little different location. To access the same screen, go to: Settings > General > Storage & iCloud Usage > Manage Storage\nMoreover, iOS9 now has a search function inside \"Settings\". A user can search for a term, such as \"Usage\" in the search bar to access the corresponding settings.\n\nA: For iOS9 users the app size can be checked from Setting>general>storage & icloud usages\n", "Q: Get my PKG Installer To Prompt and Store Admin User/Pass On Mac OSX, the third-party command line tool I have needs to run as super user unfortunately. I'm building a front-end GUI for it. My Qt/C++ application is using QProcess to shell out to Bash and run this command via echo \"{PASS}\" sudo -l \"{USER}\" -S {COMMAND}. I'm successful with that -- just as long as I have the Apple ID user/pass.\nIs there a way my PKG installer can graphically prompt for Apple ID user/pass? Second, how would you recommend I store this securely?\n\nA: From this documentation...\nhttp://s.sudre.free.fr/Software/documentation/Packages/en/Package_Settings_Customization.html#6\n...it states that Apple PackageManager files (.PKG) files have an option to run with Administrator privileges. It specifically states:\n\nIf you install anything in /Applications or /Library, this option\n  should be enabled.\n\nAlso, in this documentation...\nhttp://s.sudre.free.fr/Stuff/PackageMaker_Howto.html\n...it states that Bash scripts that you run will run under Administrator privileges (root) and therefore will not require sudo authentication to do powerful tasks.\n", "Q: Persistent Beachball in Messages A few days ago, I was chatting via Messages and because the phone I was tethering off of went dead, and I reconnected after connecting to the wireless network of the hotel I was in, which is...dubious at best.\nNow Messages isn't working. It loads, I can receive messages via notifications and the unread messages number increments, but any attempt to interact with the application directly gets caught in a beachball, and Messages shows as Not Responding in Activity Monitor, and is taking up 100% of a core. Weirdly, it's persisted past a simple OS reinstall, which is surprising.\nAny idea what's going on here, or how to fix it?\n\nA: You can try and remove the ~/Library/Messages and\n~/Library/Caches/Messages folders, then restart.\n\nA: I had exactly the same problem.\nIf I went into Activity Monitor it showed messages running at 80-90% of CPU.  jI spent hours on the phone with Apple support and they couldn't figure it out and recommended I take my 27\" iMac to the apple store. This is after I had done a full recovery \"restore\" that supposedly over-write the OS.  Well it must not \nUgh!  Really didn't want to drag this big thing to the apple store but I did and they ran all the diags and there was nothing wrong with the hardware.  They recommended wiping the disk and re-installing the OS.  \nIn a last ditch attempt to avoid spending a week trying to recover my environment I went into Time Machine and restored the messages App from a week or so before the behavior started happening.  \nThat fixed it immediately.  I didn't even have to restart.  My CPU usage went from 90% to >10% when idle... which is in the range it should be.

The phone is however capable of getting wi-fi but just exhausts all of our data on our plan. Any help to resolve this matter would be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: Will better to do that issue is you need to try reset your network settings and its automaticaly regenarated from your network carrier..

I have several subscriptions to newspapers that were in the Newsstand app.\nBut in iOS9 update, Newsstand is gone... and with it, all the magazines I had paid for, or was in the process of reading, etc.\nOf course, they are nowhere to be found in the \"News\" app, neither in the \"saved\" tab not in the \"search\" results...\nWhere did they go, and what happened to my paid issues and my subscriptions?\nThis is making me freak out, since I was currently reading many paid magazines on the iPad, and I am currently updating the iPad as well...\n\nA: The Newsstand folder is gone but the apps should still be present just not wrapped in a folder.

Same situation with facebook or any other website. When the finder dialog box opens and i go to Media->Photos there are no photos showing. \nIs this some kind of permissions issue where the dialog that opens cannot access the photos in the photos application? Are the photos presented through the photos application actual files on the drive in the regular filesystem? I am not hooked up to iCloud.\n\nA: The photos in the Photos app are stored in a library. You can drag them out on to the desktop, then open them in Chrome.\n\nA: I had the exact same problem, Googled, and found your question here.\nAfter I finally figured it out, I had to come back and share the solution with you:\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204669\n\nA: There is one more thing you can try. In Mojave Apple made security and permissions tighter. Try going to \"Apple Icon\" -> \"System Preferences\" -> \"Security and Privacy\" -> \"Photos\" and check the icon next to \"Google Chrome\". That should give permissions for using Photos to Chrome.\nIt is unfortunate that Chrome neither issues a warning nor asks for those permissions.\n", "Q: iPhone 4s iOS 8.4 but using public beta 9.1 right now If I reset my phone, but my photos are on iCloud will I still have my photos when it resets an I log into my iCloud ? \n\nA: Yes. If you have iCloud photo library enabled, and all your photos have been uploaded, your photos will still be on iCloud. Just enable it again. Tested from 8.4 to 8.4. \n\nA: Yes.

We are now closing this bug\n  report. If you have questions about the resolution, or if this is\n  still a critical issue for you, then please update your bug report\n  with that information.\n\nAs NetherLinks explained in the comments, it's because of the App Thinning feature Apple introduced in iOS 9.

It only needs to fix some issue is in the partition table. \nI tried to launch in single user modus. But apparently this only works if you don't install a firmware password.\n\nA: If you don't have the firmware password, you cannot boot into recovery mode, and thus you cannot make distil bypass the protection. Even worse, there's no way to reset a firmware password than going to recovery mode to disable it (which requires the original password), or taking it to the Apple store with the original receipt so they can disable it for you.\nIf the problem has to be fixed, talk to the IT department and have them fix it for you.\n", "Q: How do I stop OS X attempting to import photos on each boot? Everytime I boot my iMac up while my iPhone is attached it attempts to import photos, giving me a message as soon as I login about how it \"can not import photos because the device is locked\".

So my sister & her boyfriend are all into this hacking and spying and invading people's privacy and doing malicious things to the with what they gather. They have been doing it to me and trying to break up my long term relationship and have hacked into 2 of my mini iPads, an iPhone 4, quite a few windows phones as well as approx 5 androids and ruined all of them. I have a brand new mini iPad and android phone but don't want them in them messing them up too.\nHow do I keep them from hacking or viewing my iPad when I unbox it?\nI know they use metasploit and nmaps to do their dirty work, although don't know what these things are or do. Also, we live together so we use same wifi connection. This has truly been a nightmare that has caused and they are causing detrimentally negative results. It has taken my life as I knew it and what I made of it and I trying to stop them from it, but they refuse.\nSo I'm hoping if I can somehow block all syncing with other devices, mirror images, keep them out of my iCloud account and maybe some security or something I can keep them out, but I know nothing about this stuff and need help.\nApple could only tell me to 2 step my iCloud account, which did no good considering they have access to my phone, all emails and my iPad. Thanks!\n\nA: I'm sorry about what sounds like a very unfortunate situation. I would enable strong passcodes and use two step authentication. On your iPad, go to preferences and set up a strong alpha-numerical password (not a 4 digit pin) for your device in general. Since it is a new device, Touch ID should make that a minimal burden. \nNext, go to https://appleid.apple.com, and enable two step authentication on your Apple ID. \nFinally, as I'm sure would be obvious, don't share your passwords with them, and you could always enable Airplane mode every night to prevent them from having access to it over night via the wifi. \nRegarding your android, I would hope there are similar steps but don't know. \n\nA: First, physically gather all your iOS devices and Macs and make sure no one else will be able to touch them until you have secured all of them.\n\n\n*\n\n*Set up a passcode on all of them.  (At this stage you can just use something simple, like 1111.)\n\n*Turn off the simple passcode option.\n\n*Set up new passcodes that are\n\n\n*\n\n*non-trivial,\n\n*not easily guessable\n\n*has both letters and numbers\n\n*has at least 6 characters\n\n\n*Ideally, use a different passcode on each device.\n\n*Set them all to require passcode immediately.\n\n*Where available, set up TouchID and fill up all the finger slots.\n\n*Turn off location sharing with friends and family.\n\n\nNow login to your iCloud account.\n\n\n*\n\n*Edit the number of trusted devices down to one or two, ideally only those that have TouchID.\n\n*Change your password.  Pick something that is non-trivial and not easily guessable.  (You will have to approve the password change on a trusted device.)\n\n\nDon't share your iCloud password or your passcode with anybody.  Do not write down the password or passcodes anywhere (unless you can encrypt them).  Avoid typing in the passcodes as much as possible, and especially in public, always use touch to unlock your device.\nIf you are using a Mac as a hub, change all admin accounts' passwords, and your account password, set it up to boot to a login screen, require it to ask for the password whenever the display goes to sleep, and turn off all Sharing options that you don't explicitly use.\nThen change all your account passwords everywhere (gmail, yahoo, Facebook, bank account, whatever).\nAvoid using the same password at different places.  There are many guides on best practices in choosing unique passwords.  Use contractions of word sequences that make sense to you, salt them, and use password storage methods like keychain, iCloud keychain, 1Password, Lastpass, etc.\nNo idea about android devices, sorry.\n", "Q: Why does iOS 9 have different glyphs for some characters on keyboard vs. on screen? With the new San Francisco font in iOS 9 (honestly, I had never paid attention to this in previous versions), I notice that, for some characters, the glyph that actually gets put on the screen after pressing the corresponding key on the keyboard is different from the glyph on the keyboard itself.\nThis happens, for example, with the apostrophe, as you can see from this screenshot.\n\nDoes this happen for a reason?\n\nA: This problem has existed an every version of iOS until 10 as far as I know, and best I can figure is intentional since it probably would have been fixed by now. It's just more visible with San Francisco. \nI don't know why Apple does it. Could it be that it looks better on the keyboard?\niOS 11 no longer has this behavior as it has added \"smart quotes\" à la Microsoft Word.

I am Mac user and use my Mac for iOS development. Now I have to learn Windows app development, so I need Windows 8.1 + Visual Studio 2013 Community. I have no plan to spend my money for new Windows PC/Laptop. I am not familiar using Boot Camp features so it's my first leap. \n\n\n*\n\n*How much space to install Windows 8.1 + Visual Studio 2013 Community via Bootcamp? FYI I have 100 GB free on my OSX Yosemite and I have no plans to save any documents or media files on Windows.\n\n*If I divide 40 GB for OS X and 60 GB for Windows and then I don't need my Windows anymore, can I move my 60 GB back to the OS X partition?\n\nA: Have you changed your info.plist in boot camp assistant so you can use a .iso file for windows 8.1? \nIf you havn't follow my steps!\nFind Boot Camp Assistant then DUPLICATE IT put it on your desktop right click it show package contents open info.plist then find PreUSBSupportedModels and remove the Pre JUST THAT save and open! then download a ISO \n( Look up a activation key ) \nHere is download \n( Dont need key to download )\nhttps://www.microsoft.com/en-au/software-download/windows8\nAlways STAY cool!\nBy the way this is just so you dont lose storage on your HD Harddrive\n\nA: Windows 8.1 requires 20 GB.[1] Visual Studio requires 8 GB.[2]\nAt least 10-15% free space is recommended, thus 32 GB is the bare minimal, not counting Boot Camp drivers and other software you'll probably want like a browser (and its cache). And paging. And a hibernation file. And AppData. Now you're up to about 50 GB.\nYou can always repartition the disk, but it's not always straightforward and you don't want to be doing it regularly.\n\nA: Another option to running Windows on a Mac is to do it in a virtual machine using VMware Fusion, Parallels Desktop for Mac and or VirtualBox.\nThis is the route I'd recommend when dealing with such small internal physical storage as one can have better control over the space Windows and necessary Win Apps take up. Initially only the space necessary is taken up and the virtual hard disk grows as needed up to the size limit set.  The virtual disk can be resized, if necessary, more easily then a physical disk can too.\nThe VM's can also be run from an external drive as well.  Something to consider if you really do not need to run Windows natively on physical hardware.\nDuring my Windows Development days I ran Visual Studio exclusively in virtual machines, thus never trashing the Host with errant code written in the middle of then night when I was to tired to see what I was doing. :)\n", "Q: Should I update to El Capitan?

My question is: will updating my iMac to the new OS every year decrease its performance over time or not?\niMac is used mostly for web browsing and Adobe apps (Photoshop, Illustrator, Premiere Pro, After Effects, Lightroom; in that order). I have very few files on my iMac because I keep everything in the cloud (~150 GB/1 TB) and there are ~25 programs installed.\n\n\n*\n\n*iMac (Retina 5K, 27-inch, Late 2014)\n\n*OS X Yosemite 10.10.5 (latest)\n\n*4 GHz Intel Core i7\n\n*16 GB 1600 MHz DDR3 (will upgrade to 32 GB in the near future)\n\n*AMD Radeon R9 M290X 2048 MB\n\n*1.12 TB Fusion Drive\n\n\nThanks.\n\nA: Grey, like everything in life you have choices. Follow your heart.\nThe short answer is YES.\n\"ElCap\" (my short name because I think the name is too long and a bit weird) is like what we did with Leopard 10.5 to Snow Leopard 10.6. Leopard was about features. Snow Leopard was about behind the scenes enhancements.\nElcap is a foundational performance and efficiency upgrade unlike Yosemite which was the radical looks, feel, feature upgrade. That the names between Yosemite (the national park) and El Capitan (the climbing peak inside the park) are related is intentional (like Leopard and Snow Leopard) selected to infer that ElCap is all about the details and not the big picture. The majority of the work is not visible representing a tightening of all the core architectures.\nI've worked with every beta we've produced. I even have ElCap running on a variety of platforms right down to a 2008 iMac. It's no speed daemon on that unit but it's quite usable with only 4GB of RAM. It's a testament to Apple hardware and software that our software upgrades tend to strive to minimize performance hits and actually, in some cases, increase performance.\nMaybe if you were running an older unit I'd be less certain but in your case, for all the tightening of code and security and cloud refinements, ElCap makes sense with less risk then most upgrades I've seen.\nI could go into all the changes underneath the code like efforts to make the OS more secure by making it 'rootless' but if performance is your concern I think you can be at peace with the upgrade.\nHope that helps.\n", "Q: How do I turn off the automatic downloading of iOS updates? I have a data plan for all of my smartphones, computers, and tablets, so I have to be very careful staying within my allotted usage.  When I discovered that my iPad downloaded a 3 GB software update (not apps, the iOS update), I am not happy. I do not know how to turn off the automatic downloading of iOS updates.  All of the answers I get on the Apple Support Communities tell me that iOS updates are not installed, only downloaded.  It is the automatic downloading of iOS updates that is the problem, because my data gets unintentionally used.  How do I turn off the automatic downloading of iOS updates?\n\nA: This is really now a non-answer - empirically, it appears no-one has yet found a way to prevent iOS updates from downloading except by leaving insufficient space for it to fit.\nSettings > App & iTunes Stores...\n\nSwitch off either Updates specifically, or all Mobile data\n\nA: You should also be able to go into General > Usage > Manage Storage and delete the iOS update from the device.\nBut it will just download again.

To cut a long story short I had it connected to a Windows PC and accidentally started formatting the drive to NTFS. As soon as I realised what was happening I disconnected the drive, but the partition table is corrupted. I used TestDisk to gather info about the partitions, and tried to use pDisk to rebuild the partition table, but when I try to do that, I get the message that the partition table is not writable, the device is busy.

Hopefully Apple's diagnosis is correct and you don't need a repair of the Mac instead of a repair of the adapter. \nYou'll discover that in three days time unless you can test with another MagSafe adapter in the mean time. \n\nA: I'd take a cloth or a Q-tip and carefully clean the pins on the MagSafe cable with isopropyl (rubbing) alcohol. Wait until the pins are dry before plugging the cable into your MacBook.\n\nA: I had a similar problem on holiday.  With the nearest store stocking Apple adaptors thousands of miles away, my face turned white.\nIn a plain desperate attempt I touched the adaptor's end points with my tongue and felt there still was power coming out.

The old version now shows up in the App Store under the 'Purchased' tab at the top of the page. You could try getting that version again. \n\nA: What you could do is using the  DVD that came with your old mac, the DVD that holds iLife. You should be able to install the old garageband from it and to retrieve from this garageband the free apple loops.\nWhat Scott suggests is a good idea, you just need to download the old Garageband and to download the loop from it. But this solution only works if your destroyed MacBook made the way from its original OSX version to Mavericks that introduces the new GarageBand \nIf your loop came from an Apple Jam Pack you can still install it on your new Mac, you can easily find it on amazon if you lose the DVD.\n\nA: If you want to take a different route and look at what's available right now in the Apple software, there are 6 glockenspiel loops that show up in my GarageBand 10.1.0 loop search, and they came with the Jam Pack Symphony Orchestra, packaged with MainStage 3:\n\nI hope this helps.\n", "Q: iPhone won't boot after installing IOS9 I downloaded IOS9 with the phone and went through the the location service and other yes/no screens. \nI got to the screen that said lets get started and after that I just got the Apple logo and a progress bar, then the main screen for half a second then the progress bar again.\nI did a hard reset and now it is stuck on the logo/progress bar screen.

The apps created by the malicious Xcode installer can be cleaned up by deleting the apps.\nThe iOS sandbox wasn't compromised, just that the app review team didn't notice the bad behavior of the app.\nWhat you did by running an \"infected iOS app\" was let the villains know your device UDID and probably the IP address your device had when it ran the app and self-reported.\nThere's no reporting to say that the iOS sandbox was compromised, so no emails, no texts, no passwords were compromised.\nApple has released confirmation that the code could not compromise iCloud and didn't leak anything except for the most general \"an anonymous phone ran this app ping\" which would needs lots of corroborating information to be a risk to anyone unless there were many extenuating circumstances.\n\nHow does this affect me?

Once she navigates there, she needs to select Yahoo under the account list, then select the top \"Account - (email address) >\" option which will then give her the opportunity to enter her new password.\nIf she's using Yahoo's own \"Yahoo Mail\" iOS app, I'd imagine that the settings are within the app itself (sorry, I don't use Yahoo Mail anymore).\n\nA: It is about yahoo settings, go to your yahoo account from a PC and in security settings, tick the option that says \"let less secure connection\".

I've looked into aliases, functions... but I have not come up with anything satisfying. Let me give you a couple of scenarios:\n\n*\n\n*95% of times that I cd into a folder, I follow up with a ls\ncommand.\n\n*90% of times that I mkdir, I then cd myself into it.\n\nWhat would be the \"cleanest\" way to bind those commands together (or other functionality)?\n\nA: I have tried adding things like these to my .bashrc:\ncd() {\n    command cd \"$@\"\n    command ls\n}\n\nmkdir() {\n    command mkdir \"$@\"\n    command cd \"$@\"\n}\n\nHowever, I've found that this can mess up scripts that use the overridden commands, and the option handling can be fragile (for example, if you want to pass -p to the above mkdir command, it's also passed to cd). Better would be just to define aliases with different names (say, c or mcd).\n\nA: I think functions are the way to go. Something like\nchglist() {\n    cd \"$1\" && ls\n}\n\nas an example.\n\nA: You can put these lines in your .zsrhc or .bashrc\n[ -z \"$PS1\" ] && return\nfunction cd {\nbuiltin cd \"$@\" && ls -F\n}\n\nResult ->\n\nExplanation from this answer:\n\nEarlier in my .bashrc I have: [ -z \"$PS1\" ] && return, and everything\n  after that line only applies to interactive sessions, so this doesn't\n  affect how cd behaves in scripts.\n\nFurther info from this comment:\n\n[ -z \"$PS1\" ] checks if the $PS (interactive prompt variable) is \"zero length\" (-z). If it is zero length, this means it has not been set, so Bash must not be running in interactive mode. The && return part exits from sourcing .bashrc at this point, under these conditions.\n\nBtw, thanks for the question, it's really cool :)\nEdit :\nAnother solution would be to integrate your ls to your prompt; I'm sure that you can do that with OhMyZsh ;)\n\nA: I'd tend to make a new command for this.

My guess is Xcode could be downloading the new documentation - check for intalld/active network downloads. Or it could be symbolicating crash logs from all connected devices, or downloading symbol tables from connected devices, or running a sandbox, or ...\nBasically, since Xcode is so large a tool, it's hard to know what subsystem you are even using without some data.\nFWIW - here's a properly behaving, no simulator running, a dozen other apps running, Xcode done installing documentation Xcode using a hundred meg of RAM while open.\n\nThe Mac in question is up 3 days and has has a lot of mongodb and VirtualBox linux VM running which make the kernel larger than it would be at boot, but even that isn't causing any sort of memory pressure.\n\nA: Was having the same problem - investigated and googled whole day yesterday and found out a solution.

Additionally the value of CFBundleIconFile can be with and without the .icns extension, so when building the fully qualified pathname of the Application Bundle's Icon you'll need to take that into consideration as you write your code.\nAs an example, using the built-in /Applications/Calculator.app the /Applications/Calculator.app/Contents/Info.plist shows that the Icon file is \"Calculator.icns\" but doesn't give the path, although it will usually be within the Resources folder within the Application Bundle and in this case it's, /Applications/Calculator.app/Contents/Resources/Calculator.icns.  So you'd have to get the value of CFBundleIconFile from the App's .plist file and check whether or not it has the .icns extension and test to see if it's in the default location, which it normally is but not always.\nSo in Terminal you'd query using defaults, e.g.:\ndefaults read /Applications/Calculator.app/Contents/Info.plist CFBundleIconFile\n\nIn AppleScript you could set the results to a variable and go from there, e.g.:\nset appIcon to do shell script \"defaults read /Applications/Calculator.app/Contents/Info.plist CFBundleIconFile\"\n\nIt returns: Calculator.icns\nWhere as,\ndefaults read /Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app/Contents/Info.plist CFBundleIconFile\n\nReturns: Terminal\nYet the FQP is /Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app/Contents/Resources/Terminal.icns\n\nA: Try:\ndo shell script \"find \" & quoted form of POSIX path of (path to application \"Terminal\") & \" -iname \\\"*.icns\\\";\"\n\n", "Q: iPad won't accept Verizon SIM I have an iPad 4 model #1459(wifi/cellular) tied into AT&T/T-Mobile\n my carrier is Verizon.

I have someone's PGP Public Key (.asc) and would like to import that into Keychain Access.app so that I can email them with my existing PKI certificates which I already use with Mail.app. How can I do this?\n\nA: I think you're trying to mix two different encryption schemes here: S/MIME and PGP. Mail.app supports S/MIME by default, so I guess that's what you're currently using. PGP support can be added by installing the Mail plugin that is part of the GPG Suite. After you also generate a PGP key for yourself, you can use both S/MIME and PGP encryption. You can receive and decode both, and for each email you're sending, you can choose which one to use.\nGPG Suite contains a separate GPG Keychain app for PGP keys.\n\nA: PGP and PKI are two somehow similar but differently working cryptographical schemes (PGP/GPG vs. PKI). Keychain Access doesn't provide PGP support. Instead you have to download GPG Suite 2015.08 which contains its own GPGKeychain.app.\nHere you will find a tutorial how to work with it.\n", "Q: I how to do I keep my Apple Watch's screen on longer?

When I launch terminal, or a new window/tab within terminal, I don't get my prompt. The last login information gets displayed fine, and my cursor is set (unblinking) below it. Also, the window title bar flashes between \"bash\" and \"uname\" for the \"active process name\" part, dunno what that's about as I've never seen it before. Also, the part that normally lists the current directory name just says \"Terminal\". I can ctrl+C to get to a prompt, but obviously that's not the expected behavior and it's getting pretty annoying.\nI noticed it after I changed my hostname. It was appearing as ns-117-43 in my prompt; I changed it to local with scutil but setting it back didn't help. Haven't noticed anything else acting up.\nAny advice would be appreciated.\n\nA: It turns out I was wrong about what caused the problem.

I have set up a two-monitor display, with my laptop on the left and my main screen on the right. I like having the Dock on the left side, but it's on the left of the left monitor, and as such it's too far to the left. \nIn the Dock settings, I only have the choice of Left (left side of left monitor), Bottom (bottom of left monitor), or Right (right side of right monitor). Is there any way I can set it to the left side of the right monitor?\n\nA: I've managed to achieve it with a help of Wraparound app (Free). It wraps mouse around your monitors so you can setup you monitors arrangement so the monitor you want your dock to be on would be first (if you want dock on left) or last (if you want it on right) and then just wrap mouse movement horizontally.\nHere is example of my monitor arrangement before\n\nand this is after\n\nand here's how Wraparounds settings look\n\nso in the end my real setup looks like this \n\nThe only thing that doesn't work is dragging window from middle monitor to the left, it seems to work for an instant but then gets teleported back. But I'm using Spectacle app (Free) to manage windows and I use a shortcut to move windows between monitors so that's not a problem for me at all.\n\nA: Unfortunately, I don't think that you can. OS X likely sees both the MacBook's display and the external monitor as one screen. Since you can't normally put the Dock in the middle of the screen, I doubt that you can put it on on the left side of the right monitor.\n\nA: I too have tried to have this setup, looking in display settings the closest thing that worked was this. It's not perfect but it does the job! Rearrange the left screen so that the screens meet at diagonals.\n\n\nA: Try this:\nFirst, set the primary monitor:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open System Preferences\n\n*Choose Displays\n\n*Select the Monitors tab\n\n*Drag the small white bar that appears on the graphic of your screen to the screen where you want the dock to reside. In this case, from the left to the right screen.\n\n*Your screens will blank out briefly and the dock should appear where you want it.\n\n\nAlso:\n\n\n*\n\n*Back in System Preferences, select Mission Control\n\n*Select \"Displays have Separate Spaces\"\n\n\nDoing the second list may actually put the dock on both screens, if that was more convenient for you.\n* I, unfortunately, don't have access to my other monitors to confirm this so the points may be general.\n", "Q: iPhone recent calls list reappears after clear Today I've cleared my recent calls list about 6 times, and it keeps coming back.

Right now it's running iOS 8.4. After pressing 'Back Up Now' button in iTunes I'm getting this error message: 'iTunes could not back up the iPhone ... because an error occured' \n\nI tried all steps from this official Apple's document: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT203271 (including restarting Macbook, iPhone, I tried another Macbook, different USB ports etc).\nAny ideas how to fix this? I don't want to upgrade to iOS9 without backup.\nUPDATE:\nI upgraded my iCloud storage and tried iCloud backup. It failed with 'The last backup could not be completed' error.\nUPDATE 2:\nProbably I found the source of my problem. When I go to the Settings->General->Usage->Manage Storage I get list of installed applications. There is an empty application. Check this screenshot. Its size is 50.7Mb.\n\nI can select it and I see such screen:\n\nI can press 'Delete App', and there is no name for this app (null).\n\nAfter confirmation this app goes from the list, but if I go back from Manage Storage and return there, it appears again, so this application can't be deleted. \nI tried hard reset, but this application stays in settings event after it. \nMy iPhone isn't jailbroken\n\nA: I faced the same issue on my phone: unable to backup, neither to iCloud or through iTunes. I found some few posts, most notably this one and this one .\nBasically your on the right track: backup fail because of one or more zombie app(s). Apps that were deleted but are still there...  :(\nThe only option seems to be to find out what app is causing this, and reinstall it, check your backup is working again, then delete it (hoping this time it will go away for good, leaving a proper state for backup to keep working ) !\nTo find out what is your zombie app, you'll have to find out based on whatever information you have about it. Some like me still have the app icon showing in Settings->General->Usage->Manage Storage, which make identifying pretty straight forward. Unfortunately, in your case you'll have to find out what app of 50.7MB and version 23.0 you recently deleted. To help you in your quest, you could look into:\n\n\n*\n\n*your memory  ;)\n\n*in the App Store of your iPhone, in the list of purchased apps, look for those not installed that could match.

Good luck !\nSide note: I would have added more links, but being a rookie on 'Ask Different', I'm limited to 2 external links...\n\nA: I basically had the same problem and asked about it in this thread. The difference was that there were no apparent 'zombie' apps. A more careful investigation of the device log in XCode identified the Whatsapp database/preferences/… as the culprit. Deleting and reinstalling Whatsapp cured the problem for me.\n\nA: It's very wise to not wish to update without a backup. I'd try disconnecting your iPhone from your computer, then restarting your iPhone 5S by holding the lock (power) button and home button together until you see an Apple logo appear. Don't worry, it won't wipe your iPhone or change any content or settings, but it might just solve your problem.\nREAD THIS!!!: Ensure that your iPhone is not connected to iTunes while you restart it. You might accidentally put it into Recovery Mode and then you really will lose data. So restart it then when the lock screen appears, unlock your iPhone and then try to back it up again.\n\nA: All sorts of issues might be causing the backup error. I was facing the same problem with an iPhone 5 also running iOS 8.4. After reading the Apple forums, the following worked for me and I've solved it!\n1. Plug the iPhone to USB cable\n\n2. Turn off \"Backup to iCloud\" in iTunes by choosing \"Backup to this computer\"\n\n3. Sync\n\n4. Go to iCloud and delete all previous backups (additional instructions bellow)\n\n5. Turn on the \"Backup to iCloud\" option in iTunes again\n\n6. On the iPhone click Backup to iCloud\n\n! Important: Depending on how much data you need to backup, this might take some long time, be patient and wait.\nStep 4. - additional instructions\nDepending on your iOS version you might have 2 iCloud Backup locations, make sure you delete the previous backups in both locations and then do a manual backup.\niCloud location 1:\nSettings > iCloud > Storage and backup > Manage storage\niCloud location 2:\nSettings > General > Usage > Manage storage\nWeirdly, some users have reported that the following trick might solve the backup error. You might want to give it a try after following the instructions above.\n\n\n*\n\n*on iPhone, go to Settings > iCloud > Storage and backup\n\n*Click Manage storage on the iPhone (or whichever device is having issues)\n\n*Under Backup options, uncheck \"Camera roll\"\nIn iTunes try to manually \"Backup to this computer\" and see if that works. If it works, you can check the \"Camera roll\" option again on your device and the backup should still work! Perhaps this little trick can solve the issue.\n/---------------*--------------/\nIf the steps and instructions above did not help, the following alternatives perhaps will guide you in the right direction:\n-- Before anything else --\n\n\n*\n\n*Make a Backup of your iTunes Library\n\n*Make a Backup of your device's Backup folder\n(The iPhone backup is stored (assuming Mac) under:\n/Users/Myself/Library/Application Support/MobileSync/\n--> replace Myself with your actual Mac user name\nHow to find the iPhone Backup folder (assuming Mac)? \nGo into iTunes preferences under Devices tab, ctrl + click one of the backups and select show in finder.\nor\nOpen a new finder window and in the menu bar click Go to Folder and type in\n/Users/Myself/Library/Application Support/MobileSync/\n--> replace Myself with your actual Mac user name\nBoth ways will open up the device's Backup folder in finder, make a copy of all the folders you find within the Backup folder to the desktop.\n\n\n*\n\n*If all necessary backups are made, you may now Completely Uninstall iTunes.

If you don't, try to get one, but if the disk is actually the source of the problem, getting a new backup may be difficult or lengthy.\nIf you don't have a recent backup, you Time Machine with an external hard drive will produce one for you. My preferred first-line-of-defense backup, however, is a clone, which I create with Carbon Copy Cloner. Once this software has successfully created a clone, you should be able to boot from it with little noticeable difference from booting from the internal drive (other than, hopefully, a lack of trouble).\nOnce you have a clone and have booted from it, if that confirms that the problem has been resolved you can be pretty sure your hard drive is the problem and take steps to replace it.\n", "Q: Force Mac window to become full-screen I am wondering how to make a window that can’t usually be opened in full-screen (i.e. TextEdit or Dictionary) able to be opened in full-screen by using the full-screen button.

Since I made the backup of course there were changes that I made to files, most of which were uploaded to Dropbox. When I boot up the external HD, what will Dropbox do?

What to do to have it on iCloud but on on my device. Once I need it I download my movie again, and it is working on my device again. Is it possible? I cannot find this.\n\nA: I assume your problem resides in the fact that Photos app is taking too much space on your iPad.\nIf this is the issue, your best solution for managing space and keeping a synced Photo Library across devices is to enable Optimise iPad Storage under Settings -> Photos & Camera -> Optimise iPad Storage on your iPad.\nThe Photos app on your iPad will then manage which photos are kept at high resolution and which are just stored as thumbnails.

Where is iptables in MacOS X? I'm running Yosemite 10.10.5 (14F27) and it seems to be missing. If it's not actually native to OS X, what's the best way to install it for this operating system? If for some reason it's just not compatible, please suggest the relevant alternative, instead.\n\nA: There is a thing similar to iptables called pf.\nConfiguration\nThe configuration file is located in the /etc/pf.conf\n\nTo get started, let’s look at the /etc/pf.conf configuration file that comprises pf:\nscrub-anchor \"com.apple/*\"\nnat-anchor \"com.apple/*\"\nrdr-anchor \"com.apple/*\"\ndummynet-anchor \"com.apple/*\"\nanchor \"com.apple/*\"\nload anchor \"com.apple\" from \"/etc/pf.anchors/com.apple\"\nHere, you can see that pf is configured with a number of anchors. An anchor is a collection of rules and tables. Basically, the anchor file being loaded is /etc/pf.anchors/com.apple.\n\nWhen you make change changes to your pf.conf, you can use this command to check the validness of the config:\nsudo pfctl -v -n -f /etc/pf.conf\n\nWhen testing, run in verbose mode with:\nsudo pfctl -v /etc/pf.conf\n\nIf you set it up correctly, it should show something like pf enabled\ncan also add information on the fly. For example, to add a table of 127.0.0.0/24 call localsub:\n\nsudo pfctl -t localsub -T add 127.0.0.0/24\nOnce the configuration is clear, you can run pfctl -q to turn on quiet mode to make things faster.\nThere is more information in more detail on the reference site.\n\nReferences:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://krypted.com/mac-security/a-cheat-sheet-for-using-pf-in-os-x-lion-and-up/\n", "Q: Why should disabling wifi on Router speed up internet connection? I'm having an odd issue with my home network.\nI have a TPLink Archer D7 connected to my phone line and wired to an Airport Extreme in my basement.\nEach of these is connected (by cable) to a MacMini.\nWe have 3 x iPad, 2 x iPhone and 1 x AppleTV that connect to the 2.4GHz and 5GHz wifi networks.  Mostly to the Archer D7 but also, less frequently, to the Airport Extreme.\nThe problem I get is that from time to time my internet speed becomes horribly slow.  Impossible to stream video.\nWhat I have discovered is that if I disable both WiFi networks on the Archer D7 then the internet speeds go straight back up to normal (acceptable to good for video).\nThis happens when none of the connected devices are in use, or they maybe in use for games that do not require an internet connection.\nWhen the Archer's WiFi is disabled the devices automatically connect to the Airport (which is just within range) and can be used as normal without disrupting the internet speed.  So unless they are causing some sort of priority setting on the router then I don't see how they can be choking the connection.\nI have SSID broadcast off and have strong WPA2 passwords on all networks.\nI have MAC addresses set for all devices, filtering on and no guest networks enabled.\nI'm starting to think it can only be someone piggy-backing my connection but I'm not sure what else I can do about that (if it is the case).\nDo any other possible causes of this type of problem spring to mind?\nI have no idea if this is an Apple specific problem because I have no non-apple equipment I can use to check it.\nTurning off the main WiFi is a pain because without that network I can't use my AppleTV.\nAll suggestions gratefully received.\n\nA: You mentioned that the Airport Extreme is just within range. It could be that as the Airport Extreme is not able to put through as high a throughput (weak signal) it leaves more internet bandwidth available.\nAn alternative diagnosis is that since you are using a full range of encryption and filtering on the Archer D7 you are maxing out the processor. The TP Link specs suggest the processor is single core (usually manufacturers tout dual or quad core when available).\nThe easiest way to deal with the Apple TV would be to hardwire it using TP Link's own powerline adapters (only about $30/pair for 500 Mbps version, other brands are available but TP Link are the least expensive first rate powerline adapters and the one's I'm using at both home and work) which would allow you to use the Airport Extreme for your wireless knowing that your Apple TV is sipping directly on a reliable wired connection.\nYou could equally move the Airport Extreme to a better position in your home using the TP Link powerline adapters. I've lived with separate wired ethernet routers and wifi access points for years at a time (principally with Airport Express routers which burned out regularly alas but worked great while they worked).\nI've been building networks at work and at home for fifteen years with up to forty live users at a time. Out of the hundreds of hours spent troubleshooting these various networks, about ninety per cent of the time has been spent troubleshooting wifi. Apple in particular has not always been compatible with the standards to which Airport promises compatibility. The less wifi you can build into your networks, the less time they will take to maintain.\nIncremental Testing to Troubleshoot Archer D7 wifi\nIf you do want to keep trying with the wifi on the Archer D7, I'd recommend:\n\n\n*\n\n*resetting the router\n\n*doing a firmware upgrade to the latest reliable firmware\n\n*testing the wifi without encryption\n\n\nIf the wifi passes the tests without encryption, then you can gradually turn on encryption first and then filters, step by step, ready to undo whatever settings cripple performance.\nAs you are concerned about piggybacking, you should be able to monitor in the Archer D7 interface what devices are connected via the DHCP server menu item. Just make sure to go and check when you find your network has slowed down. You can also monitor what connections are active. Unlike Tomato firmware, I don't think you can monitor bandwidth per connection via TP Link firmware.\nLong Term Home Network Maintenance\nSomething else to keep in mind is that routers go bad all the time. They small closed plastic boxes which run hot. Make sure to give a router the best ventilation you can. Even then you should expect two years of 24/7 use to cook the circuit boards. As you've learned, even the slightest router flakiness turns a household or a business upside down. Always keep a working backup on site (can be older generation 100 BaseT for emergency service). The only routers I've had which have stood the test of time are industrial strength routers in much larger cases (also TP Link btw) which are generally two to five times the price of the consumer routers.\nBuying middle of the road and upgrading every couple of years is the most economical way of keeping close to state of the art performance, while maintaining working backups on hand. If you just leave the old router configured exactly as it was when you remove it from the network and you don't not remove the wifi credentials from your computers you can just drop the old router in any time you like with zero downtime.\n", "Q: 'Use mobile data for' toggle changes won't save on iPhone 6, iOS 9.0 When I change an app's setting to use mobile data (or not), the changes aren't saved when I exit settings. It's infuriating as, for example, I can't use WeChat at all unless I'm on wifi.\nElsewhere on this forum it's suggested that the only way to rectify this is to restore not from backup. Is there really no other way? And if I do need to restore not from backup, how do I do it?

I opt in to all the other settings and then go check the setting that was \"stuck\"\nAt this point you will know if the setting works or the phone needs the OS restored. If so, do the restore or seek service.

Hidden photos will only appear in the Hidden album (or in any album which you explicitly added them to).\nHowever, the Hidden photos keep showing on the iOS Photos App. iOS detects they are hidden, but it merely hides them from the image picker controller on third party apps. They can still be viewed in the main Photos App on the All Photos section. Is there any way to hide them from All Photos as well?\n\nA: No. Hiding photos on iOS prevents them from displaying in Moments, Collections, and Years, but they will continue to show in any of the albums under \"Albums\". \nUnfortunately, short of deleting them and then restoring them within 30 days, you are limited to the provision that Apple developed. \n", "Q: Using MAMP 3.4, how do I upgrade to Apache 2.4 and OpenSSL 1.0.2 to meet the ATS iOS 9 requirements?

How can we know on iOS and OS X what an Application really does?\nOn OS X you always can do the following: right click on an .app and \"show package\". Contents -> MacOS and double click the executable Unix file. Terminal opens and somehow tells you what the app does.\nI don't know if you've heard but it seems somebody modified Xcode's compiler to add malware to apps. This modified compiler is as the media says widely spread in China so many apps are affected. So also as the media says a company has detected about 400 apps that seem to be infected.\nMy question now is, how you could tell what an app does on iOS? How to determine if it contains malware or something else harmful.\nAnd is there another way to tell what apps do on OS X than starting the exacutable Unix file located in the app's package?\n\nA: Short answer: you can't know\nA bit longer answer: Simply running and using the application will not show you what might be going on behind the scenes. To dig into that, you'll need to run the application in a debugging environment to analye data and process flows, keep track of any subprocesses created, monitor any network communication initiated by the application etc. etc. As this is rather cumbersome and requires a lot of skills and experience, it usually comes down to trust at the end.\n\nA: On iOS\nThe problem with Xcode Ghost is the communication to another Server. So it would be possible to recognise this connection if you set up a proxy like asked in this question here and use Wireshark to see the connections. For HTTP-Connection also Charles should work. You also can see in Xcode in the Device Manager the Console-Log, which is closely the same as the Terminal-output of the Mac App. But Developers can hide information, they do not have to print every procedure in the terminal/console.\nOn OS X\nThere are some more ways to detect TCP/IP Traffic, manually via WireShare or use some Apps like (LitteSnitch, HandsOff, PrivateEye). HandsOff is the only App which also tracks file read/writes and many other things. \nConclusion\nYou have to trust the Developers and also hope they use the original Xcode from Apple. We have not enough (automated) tools to keep track of every function of an App.\n\nA: You can't really determine what an app does short of trying to figure out what its byte code does. From a network perspective you can view all traffic in and out of your machine with something like LittleSnitch.\nI'm not sure about checking other apps for malware but Apple has sent out an email with information on how to check if your version of Xcode contains malware. They recommend that you always download it from the Mac App Store or their developer website. If you must install it from somewhere else (USB drive) follow these steps.\n\nTo verify the identity of your copy of Xcode run the following command\n  in Terminal on a system with Gatekeeper enabled:\nspctl --assess --verbose /Applications/Xcode.app\nwhere /Applications/ is the directory where Xcode is installed. This\n  tool performs the same checks that Gatekeeper uses to validate the\n  code signatures of applications. The tool can take up to several\n  minutes to complete the assessment for Xcode.\nThe tool should return the following result for a version of Xcode\n  downloaded from the Mac App Store:\n/Applications/Xcode.app: accepted source=Mac App Store\nand for a version downloaded from the Apple Developer web site, the\n  result should read either\n/Applications/Xcode.app: accepted source=Apple\nor\n/Applications/Xcode.app: accepted source=Apple System\nAny result other than ‘accepted’ or any source other than ‘Mac App\n  Store’, ‘Apple System’ or ‘Apple’ indicates that the application\n  signature is not valid for Xcode.

What I am wondering is if there is a way I could break it down in to two locations so that when I do a full-screen screenshot it goes to one location and if I screenshot only a fragment of the screen it saves in another location.\n\nA: The easy solution would be to use some 3rd party app to manage and organize your screenshots. Something like Ember or Skitch. \n\nA: What I can think of doing it without any third party apps is set up a \"Folder Action\" via Automator.app for your custom screenshots folder (hopefully that folder only contain your screenshots). \nThe \"Folder Action\" will be trigger when new file is added to the folder, you check for the new file which is an image file's dimension, if it is less than your monitor native resolution, then it should be a fragment screenshot else it is a full screen screenshot. You then move it to your desire folder.\nSince, this is scripting, you literally can do a lot of thing beside of just moving file, Automator.app provide many template for your to get started, it is dropdown list of things you can do, but you can always write your own custom script for it.\nThere are several method to set up \"Folder Action\".\n\n\n*\n\n*Automator.app\n\n*Script Editor.app (Go to this app's preferences and enable \"Show Script menu in menu bar\", look at right side of your menu bar)\n\n*If you have pre-written script, you can attach it any folder in your system by right click a folder \"Services > Setup Folder Action...\" (Enable this service option in Keyboard preferences shortcut tab\")\n\n\nSidetalk, able to screenshot using Command+Shift+3/4 natively and out-of-the-box to file system is a lifesaver feature compare to having an apps to screenshot for you and having a way too fancy UI.

In the pre-OS X days, there was an important distinction between bitmap fonts and PostScript fonts, and between QuickDraw printers (the Mac equivalent of \"Winprinters\") and much more expensive PostScript printers.  If you wanted to use a PostScript font with a PostScript printer, you needed to have installed on your computer the bitmap equivalent of one of the standard preinstalled PostScript fonts.  Later, it became more common to make sure that the PostScript font \"suitcase\" was in the right place to download to the printer at print time, and use Adobe Type Manager to display it antialiased on the screen.\nIn contrast, most fonts installed with OS X by default and available for purchase are either OpenType or TrueType format.  Many inexpensive laser printers now speak PostScript level II or level III, and in consequence include an even larger assortment of built-in PS fonts than PS level I printers such as the original LaserWriters.\nAccording to Adobe, OpenType is a superset of the PostScript font format, and OpenType is supported by PostScript printers:\n\nOpenType development has improved both the support of Type 1 on Windows and the support of TrueType in the PostScript environment, ensuring that customers who use PostScript printers will have the best possible experience regardless of the font type used. Support for OpenType is part of the PostScript printing system, with the support of the latest AdobePS™ printer drivers and Adobe Type Manager.\n\nExactly what \"support for OpenType\" at the beginning of the second sentence means here is pretty unclear to me, though.  If I want to use a PostScript printer with OS X, will it make a difference in printing speed or quality if I use a font on the computer that is (or is not) in the list of fonts on the printer?  How does this work?\n\n\n*\n\n*For example, if I print a TextEdit document in (OpenType) Helvetica to a networked LaserWriter, does OS X send PostScript code to the printer, which then uses its own built-in Helvetica font data in ROM to construct the glyphs on the page?\n\n*What if I use an OpenType font that's on the computer but not on the printer?  Does the font get translated into a PostScript font then downloaded to the printer (presumably a slower process just like it was in the pre-OS X days), which then prints with it as if it were built-in?\n\n*Or in the previous case do the OpenType glyphs get rasterized on the OS X side and then sent to the printer as a bitmap?\n\n*In either case, how does this affect the quality of printed output?\n\n*Whether the OpenType font is downloaded as a PS font or as a bitmap, I'm guessing this would take a lot more memory on the printer side than just sending PostScript code.  Should I worry about running out of printer memory (or at very least my document taking a long time to print) just as in the pre-OS X days?\n\n*Is it still worthwhile to seek out a printer with a built-in hard drive to store downloaded fonts, if I'm going to be doing a lot of printing with fonts that aren't part of the native printer-resident set?\n\n*Are there printers that get around some or all of these problems by coming bundled with OpenType fonts as part of their firmware, or at least printing with OpenType fonts directly?  This seems like the natural next step beyond inexpensive networkable printers with Postscript Level III support such as this Okidata model.\n\n\nA: *\n\n*Printer-installed fonts tend not to be used at all, as PostScript output from MacOS (and PDFs) use unique names to reference the Font data that they contain, e.g. \"Helvetica-Bold+AAXYZ\".\n\n*There is no benefit to having a printer that stores font data, because the font names in the printer won't match the unique names in the PS output. Also, the amount of data saved is in the order of Kb, and negligible in terms of file size and performance.\n\n*The PostScript output from MacOS encodes the glyph data from PostScript, OpenType and TrueType fonts in a variety of ways within the data stream. It is not rastered beforehand.\n\n*I suspect that most laser printers these days contain ample memory, compared to those in 'pre-OS X days'. Some printers, particularly larger, 'network' devices, have memory expansion slots where you can add DIMMs.\n\nIn short: you do not have to worry about any lack of quality or performance by using OTF or TT fonts, compared to Type1 PS fonts.\nInterestingly, I have recently learnt that because of the more mathematically complex method of describing curves in PostScript OTF fonts, compared to TrueType fonts, that PS OTF fonts can be slower to display on screen than TT fonts. On today's fast CPUs, the effect is only noticeable on very large graphical documents, and can be in the order of 10ths of a second. Whether this similar affects the 'thinking time' for a printer, I don't know.\n", "Q: How to free disk space consumed by incompletely downloaded apps? I recently tried to download a huge app (1.7 gigabytes) on an iPhone running iOS 9. The download failed several times for whatsoever reason. However, the incomplete downloads filled over 5 gigabytes of disk space. How can I clear this space again? Restarting, doing an iTunes backup - nothing solved my problem so far.\nThank you!\n\nA: Have you tried with a cleaning application like \"Checker\"? Those kind of applications are used to delete useless data. If you can´t delete it with that kind of applications, try to make a backup on itunes, erase it and restore the iphone.\n\nA: The only way I have found to eliminate the \"other\" space on in iPhone is to do a full restore, which wipes the device, reinstalls iOS, and then allows you to restore from backup.\nJust click 'Restore' in iTunes:  https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201252\n", "Q: How to setup a specific application to open all files with unknown extension I am trying to open some files with unknown extension and it always ask me to choose an application from local or AppStore. \nThe problem is, I sometimes need to generate some text file with extensions like \".backups\",\".config\" or even some random text like \".abc123\". It means on my Mac, in most time files with unknown extensions can be read by a text editor (personally I prefer Sublime Text). \nIs it possible that all files with unknown extension can be automatically opened with a default application like Sublime Text?\n\nThis is different from Choose a default app for opening files with no extension? which asks about how to handle files without extension. Here I'm looking for a way to handle unknown extensions (kind of a wildcard rule).\n\nA: I don't think that's possible. OS's usually needs register how to handle each file first.\nBut it's not all lost: here is a situation that Automator can handle easily.\nHere I'll show you, how to create a item menu in the right click context menu, that you can easily select to open your file, better than Open With option.\nSteps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a new Service with Automator.\n\n\n*Set files or folders in the first field and Finder.app in the second.\n\n\n*Add an action called ‘Open Finder Items’ and select your application.\n\n\n*For last, save it and name it as you wish.\nNow, if you need open a file with unknown extension, just right click and select your newly created service.\n‘Define application for files’ action does not work for file extension, is just for a particular file.\n", "Q: How to show app ad's only to new users?

I noticed that a huge chunk of space (like 20gb) is taken up by the contents of a \"Render Files\" folder in one of my Event folders. \n\nYou can see the \"Render Files\" folder by right-clicking/control-clicking your iMovie Library and choosing \"Show Package Contents\". Then open one of your Event folders. The \"Render Files\" folder is in there.\n\nWhat's the deal with those files? Can I safely trash them? Will iMovie rebuild them?\n\nA: I believe you can delete them, but to make sure, you can drag them to the desktop, open iMovie and see if it works. If it works, you can delete the files.\n\nA: Yes, and iMovie can even delete (all) of them for you.\nGo to iMovie > Preferences and click \"Delete\" next to Render Files (last item on the bottom for me).\n\nIt will warn you about deleting data, and that it may have to be regenerated in the future.\n\nInspecting my iMovie library with Finder after this operation revealed that it cleared the Render Files directory and freed up ~60GB from my disk.\n", "Q: How can I review the most recently shown dialog box in OS X? I was just typing a long string of text into an input field in Chrome. I saw my screen flash briefly and the shape of a dialog box appear, but before I could stop typing I had already hit some key that closed the box (I'm guessing space, but possibly a letter or even enter).\nHow can I find out what the dialog box said and what action I took to close it?\nI'm using OS X Yosemite 10.10.5.\n\nA: Unfortunately, I have to inform you, that there's no such possibility in OS X Yosemite. Operating system doesn't log this type of event for dialog windows.\nThe information you have - is not even enough to understand who fired this window to popup: was it dialog box, was it OSX window, was it another program with informational message which raised the popup, or it was simply styled popup/popover of the web-page you've been.\nAll OSX can do - is to reopen regular windows, programs, restore console, etc, when you reboot Mac OS X with a checkbox next to “Reopen windows when logging back in” that restores all of your currently open applications and windows. This state is stored, but not for dialog windows.\n", "Q: Backing up full resolution photos from iPhone while using 'Optimize iPhone Storage' with iCloud Photo Library I want to help a friend get setup with iCloud Photo Library. They have an iOS device without a lot of free space and they have a PC and an old Mac that can't run Photos.app. In addition to using iCloud Photo Library they want to back up their original photos from their iPhone to their PC or old Mac. I don't think this would be an issue except they don't have enough space to store all of their originals on their iOS device so they must use the 'Optimize iPhone Storage' setting. My fear is that they will only be backing up thumbnails when they go to backup their photos to their desktop. Is there anyway around this? \n\nA: They may have updated the iCloud Photo Library for Windows capabilities:\n\nWhat you can do with iCloud for Windows\nSafely store your photos and videos in iCloud. With iCloud Photo Library, any new photos and videos that you take on your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch automatically download to your PC. And you can upload new photos and videos from your PC so that you can access them from your other devices too.\n\n", "Q: Why do I have to reenter my passwords after moving HDD between Macs? I recently had to transplanted my HDD into another Macbook Pro (after my own broke). I could boot without any problems in the new machine, but for some most (all?) applications wanted me to reenter my passwords (e.g. for all mail accounts, etc.). The passwords were still in the keychain. I could open the Keychain app, unlock the password entries and copy them again into the applications to continue. A couple of days later, I had to repeat the procedure and transplant the HDD again into another Macbook Pro. Again, I had to reenter all the passwords despite them being stored already in the keychain.\nSo the question is: \nWhy do I have to reenter passwords that are already stored in the Keychain app after migrating to a new hardware?\n\nA: The problem lies in changes to the OS X Keychain apparently introduced with the extended iCloud support in Mavericks. \nThe Keychain has a new chain called Local items. The local items are stored in an sqlite database in a folder corresponding to the hardware UUID of the mainboard. Additionally it appears to be encrypted is a way that involves details from the mainboard (probably the UUID). \nThere are various people reporting to be unable to recover their local items after a hardware failure or after moving to new hardware. The only workaround to be affected by this problem appears to be enabling iCloud synchronization for the Keychain, thus the saved passwords are synced from the cloud to any new hardware. Of course, that is not helpful for people who are not interested in using iCloud.\nSee also:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://discussions.apple.com/thread/6543257\n\n*New \"Local Items\" Keychain in Mavericks: What's it all about?\n\n*http://www.faqssys.info/how-do-i-migrate-my-keychains-local-items-to-a-new-mac/\n\n*http://forums.macrumors.com/threads/data-migration-local-keychain-passwords-not-appearing.1905840/\nIf anybody knows a way to actually recover/decrypt the local items after moving one's account to a different hardware, I'd be happy to learn about it.\n", "Q: OS X installation duration? I bought a 2012 Macbook Pro and wanted a fresh install, So I booted while holding Command + R and did a fresh install after clearing the HDD via the setup. After the install I gave my credentials. Now I've been stuck for 80 minutes at a screen saying \"Configuring your Mac\". It has a HDD so I understand it's not as fast as an SSD. This is my first time on OS X setup. \nIs considered normal and should I just continue to wait?\n\n\nA: I did a hard power off (holding the power down button for a few secondss) and powered it on again. It all works fine now. \n", "Q: App is stuck installing on my iPhone, how do I fix it? I started updating my Twitter app, but then I lost the internet connection and when I went home I couldn't get it to resume the installation. It stops just past the half way mark with the lines on the icon. It has been like this for months.\nHow can I unstick the stuck application install?\n\nA: You mentioned this device was upgraded from iOS 9. In my experience an iPhone that has been upgraded from previous OS that has not had a full restore on it in years is prone to reliability issues like this.\nI typically do a restore at least one time per year (I experiment a lot and \"cruft up\" my phone).\nIts a pain however its probably time for a full restore...  The phone will run like new afterwords.\n\nNote: Back up all data before you preform this action, otherwise all data will be lost.\n\nA: I had this problem with the Pages app, actually a couple of times, my solution the second time was simply updating to the iOS 9 Public Beta, so just updating to iOS 9 should fix your issue.\nHere's an alternative way to solve this, just for good measure. It was how I solved the issue the first time:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open iTunes your Mac or other computer.\n\n\n\n*Connect your iPhone.\n\n*Click on the icon of your iPhone in the top left.\n\n*Choose \"Back Up Now\".\n\n*Upon completion of the backup, click Apps under \"On My Device\" on the left.\n\n*Search for the app that is giving you trouble, in your case Twitter.\n\n*Click \"Delete\" to the right of the problematic app.\n\n*Click \"Sync\" in the bottom right of the iTunes window. \n\n*After your iPhone syncs, go to the App Store on your iPhone on reinstall the app.\n\n\n\nA: Settings - General - Storage and Icloud Usage - Manage Storage ( On the top ) - Click On App - Then Uninstall\n", "Q: Office 2016 package will not install I'm trying to install Office 2016 and it appears as though Installer will not run/install the .pkg file.

This is useful for many reasons:\n\n\n*\n\n*First and foremost, ads can give you malware. While this isn't as prevalent on mobile devices, incidents have occured of advertisements on websites giving the user malware, even on high-profile sites like Forbes. studies have shown that ads are 182 times more likely to give you malware than porn websites.\n\n*Ads slow down the page load and cost you time, sometimes even scrolling the page in your place because an ad that's loading shifts content up or down.\n\n*Downloading ads costs bandwidth. It has been estimated that ads can take up close to 40% of the bandwidth of a page you're downloading. For mobile users with a limited cap, this can be particularly impactful.\n\n*Ads tend to be obnoxious, with autoplay videos, autoplay sound, wildly moving images, pop-ups, pop-unders, ads expanding to fill the page, gaming ads that are just images of big titties with a \"play now\" button,... People have been sent to detention because their mobile phone suddenly started playing a video ad while their phone was in sleep mode. I personally once got a 21 minute ad on a 16 minute video on Youtube.\n\n\nNow, Apple didn't just add an adblocker into ios 9, but they added the option to block certain content. https://www.hackingwithswift.com/safari-content-blocking-ios9-install explains how to install the most popular one on the market.\n\nA: Double-click the home button while in sleep mode for Apple Pay\n(For iPhone 6 and later)\nYou no longer have to wait for the NFC reader to wake up the phone, or manually navigate to the Passbook/Wallet app, to prepare the phone for an Apple Pay authorization.\nSimply take the phone out of your pocket and double-click the home button. You can then authorize immediately, or select a card first if you have multiple cards loaded into Apple Pay.\n\nA: Siri No Longer Beeps\nThe traditional \"ding ding\" sound that is played when Siri is instantiated has moved to a silent and succinct vibration. This effectively does away with times where Siri would audibly start when sitting on the phone (and inadvertently pushing the home button), or during presentations.\n\nA: Ability to choose video resolution and frame rate\nA pretty great thing in iOS 9 is the added ability to change the resolution and frame rate in videos that one shoots.\nJust go to Settings -> Photos & Camera -> Record Video. The higher the resolution and frame rate, the better the video looks, but the more space it takes up. Those with 8 and 16 GB iDevices should be especially happy about this one.\n \n\nA: Keyboard now displays lowercase\nWhen pushing the shift keys the keyboard keys update their appearance according to Uppercase/Lowercase. \nThis is one of the things that makes the keyboard more coherent this also increase the affordance of the keyboard. \n\n\nA: Search in Settings\nThis one is a total painkiller! It was always a mess trying to find that specific setting and now all you need to do is type in.\n\n\nA: A button to go back to the last app you were in\nAny time you're in one app and then suddenly you're in another app, without going through the Home screen or the App Switcher (such as if you tap on a push notification, or if an app deliberately sends you to another app like Facebook opening Messenger), you'll get a Back button.\n\n\nA: The podcast app actually works.\nAfter 5 years, I recently replaced my iPod touch (I broke it) and was appalled to find that, under iOS 8, the podcast app was as useful as a chocolate teapot. How something that broken could make it out into the wild is beyond my comprehension. I use the iPod mainly for podcasts so this was a real show-stopper for me.\nI was just about to send it back when I heard that version 9 was about to be released. I'll be keeping the iPod.\n\nA: Low Power Mode\nThis feature is also another big deal in terms of usability. More often than you would expect, the iPhone starts to drain battery like there's no tomorrow. In those situations that you still need it alive (for an emergency call, etc), the Low Power Mode will get you to shore.\nWhat it does is stop any background requests like Mail fetch, Push Notifications, Apps Background Refresh, etc and also visual effects (as if Reduced Motion was on).\n\n\nA: Pinch to zoom during video playback in photos.app.  Even on videos not recorded originally in iOS9\n\nA: Spotlight quick conversions and calculations\nYou can now do a quick calculation on the Spotlight menu, just the basic stuff though. No square roots i.e.\n\n\nA: Siri Integrations\nFor me, and for everyone in general I guess, the big reason to update to iOS 9 comes in the form of a Siri request. Siri got a lot smarter from the previous iOS (she is still a bit stupid, but lets cut her some slack).\nSiri now as access to almost all the information stored on our devices. For instance, if you receive an email with a phone number on its signature and later on you receive a phone call form that number, Siri will make an educated guess and suggest that the person calling you is the same from that email signature.\nAs for me, the major leap in terms of Siri usage for automate things and really getting things done more easily is the ability to ask her to remind you of anything, anywhere on the OS in the most natural way. \nAs you can see in the image, I asked her to remind me of what I was seeing on Safari when I got to work. She created a reminder with that action attached to it.\n\n\nA: New San Francisco Font\nMy favorite part of iOS 9 is the new San Francisco font. It really makes iOS 9 seem a lot newer and different than iOS 8. I think it looks way better than the old font.\n\nA: When typing with the keyboard, you can convert it to a trackpad by placing two fingers on the screen anywhere inside the keyboard. The keys will turn dark gray, losing all letters and numbers. You can move the cursor by dragging both fingers across the screen, lifting your fingers when the cursor has reached its destination. \n\n\nA: Small tweaks to the “Photos” app.\nFor me, the fact that the “Photos” app has some seemingly minor—but noticeable—kinks worked out has been great. Most notably, now you can swipe across a grid of images to select multiple images instead of having to select each image one by one.\n\nAlso, there is now a “Screenshots” album which seems to be a “smart” album that only shows up when you take a screenshot. But unlike other albums where deleting an image in an album only removes it from the album, the “Screenshots” lets you delete screenshots completely from your device.\nThis is a quite nice way of dividing up content that makes it easier to manage screenshots when mixed in the context of “normal” photos.\n\nAnd past that the order of images when viewing via “Photos” or via “Albums” is now exactly the same.\nPrior to iOS 9, if you viewed photos in the “Albums” view it would be oldest to newest from left to right, but in “Photos” it would oddly be newest to oldest from left to right.\nNow with iOS 9, both “Photos” and “Albums” show oldest to newest from left to right.\n\nA: Battery Widget in Notification Center\nIf you use your iDevice with a pair of bluetooth headphones or you have an Apple Watch, this widget might come in handy. \nIt basically lists the battery levels of every peripheral connected to the device.\n\n\nA: Detected audio connection\nIn iOS 9 everytime you connect your headphones to the device, it will automatically show you a shortcut for the last used app with audio output (Music App, Spotify, Audible, etc). \nIf you are on the lock screen, it will show up on the low left side and if you are multitasking it will appear right at the bottom of the screen.\nThis is actually another great feature in terms of productivity: when you have a Handoff capable app opened on 2 devices, the handoff shortcut on the iPhone is now always visible at the bottom of the Multitask Screen (whereas on iOS 8 it was at the very left end of the opened apps slider). \n\n\n\nA: I have ~500 passwords saved in the iCloud keychain and I don't have this keychain configured in non-personal devices. iOS 9 allows you to search the saved Safari passwords in the Settings App through this path: Settings app > Safari > Passwords There, in the search bar, I would just search for the webpage I'm looking for the password, it will give you both user id and password.\n\nA: You can now share/download/save voicemail messages as m4a audio files:\n\nvia: https://twitter.com/bradleychambers/status/656095367562436608\n\nA: Before I knew that iPhone 6s and 6s Plus users could 3D Swipe from the left edge of the screen to go back an app.\nTIL that 3D Touch also enables iPhone 6s and 6s Plus users to press the left side of the Home screen to switch to multitasking view.\n\nA: Newer iPhones on specific carriers can now place and receive calls securely through your carrier using your Wi-Fi connection instead of cellular radio.\nThis is particularly useful when roaming to avoid long distance charges in certain circumstances (carrier dependent) and most useful if you are in a location with no or poor cellular reception but decent Wi-Fi. A 1 hour call equals approx. 75mb of data transfer. More details here.\nT-Mobile even takes it one step further allowing you to pair another Apple device to your phone and make calls from an iPad, iPod Touch, Mac or even Apple Watch. It doesn’t even require your iPhone to be nearby or even on!\n\nA: When you receive a call from a number that is not in your contacts (address book), it searches through phone numbers it has parsed from received email signatures and the incoming call notification will suggest that it \"maybe\" is that person calling:\n\nImage credit and further reading here: http://venturebeat.com/2015/09/16/ios-9-tells-you-who-that-unknown-caller-is/\n\nA: For the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus (the iPhones that support 3D touch), many of the app icons support \"Quick Actions\".   For example, the below screenshot shows a list of quick actions available when pressing on the Camera app.\nMost of the Apple apps seem to support this already, as well as several third party apps.  \n\n\nA: Offline diction is available on the iPhone 6s and 6s plus. Go to Settings > “General” > “Keyboard” > “Dictation” to find the setting.\n\nA: In the new iOS 9.3 beta: Blue Light Reduction(Night Mode). It is incredible to not be blinded by your phone at night. You can set it to go on and off at sunset and sunrise.

When I choose the option for show offline music it only shows 4 songs that I have added recently after the update. How do I get all my music library to play offline again? \nP.S this happened after the Apple Music update.\n\nA: Apple Music made some fundamental changes to the way the Music app works (when enabled). You now have your entire Apple Music Library in the cloud so that it is accessible from all your devices. With this, all of that content is not automatically downloaded to your device, and in fact, the opposite can occur as Apple uploads music to their cloud. \nSo now, you must specifically download whatever content you would like to listen to offline. To do that, open the Music app and navigate to a playlist, album, artist, or song that you would like to download. Now select the \"...\" (ellipsis menu icon) and choose \"Make Available Offline\". After the songs download, an icon will display next to each one indicating that it is available for offline listening.\n\nYou can also download your tracks directly from the album/playlist view:\n\n\nA: If you don't have any subscription of the Apple Music service or iTunes Match, and if you had your iPhone synced with an iTunes Library on a Mac/PC, you are safe.\nJust plug your iPhone in the computer you had it synced with (previous to the software update) and synchronise it with the iTunes Library. Your songs should be transferred again into the Music app. Note that your local files will be stored under the My Music tab.\n", "Q: Missing the Health.app on my iPhone? I lost icon for the Health.app (the one with the Heart icon) on my iPhone. How do I get it back?\n\nA: Go to Setings > General > Restrictions and enable it.\nDo nothing and re-enable it, the app should be back. On iOS 10 and later, you might also need to go to the App Store and reinstall system apps so be sure to try that as well.\nLast - look for any profiles in settings in case someone managing your device has prevented use of that app systematically. You can generally remove the profile or ask them to reassign your device if you should have access to the health app and store health data on your device.\n\nA: The answer to choose settings was correct for iOS 9 and earlier.\nOn iOS 10 you could have deleted the app and need to re-download it from the App Store.\nAlso - if you have a provisioning profile that disables that app by policy, you would have to remove that restriction or get the administrator that supervised your iOS device to remove that restriction.\n", "Q: using mac book pro (mid 2010) as monitor for a DVR I recently bought a DVR and set of security cameras. The DVR has a VGA port and an HDMI port. I connected my MBP to the DVR VGA port using a Mini Display port adapter. However, I do not see the DVR display on my MBP. I'm assuming that I cannot use my MBP to view the DVR. Is that right? Or do I have to buy a monitor separately to view the DVR? Thank you\n\nA: You'd just be better off buying another monitor, as that is Mini-DVI out not in. I'm sure that there are ways around this, but buying a separate monitor would be way easier.\n", "Q: Switch SIM cards I attempted to upgrade to ISO 9 and now phone is locked on slide to upgrade screen. Can I take out the SIM card on my iPhone 4s and put it into my old iPhone 4 and will it work?\n\nA: Yes, so long as the iPhone 4 is on the same carrier as the 4S, it will work.\nTo fix the \"Slide To Upgrade\" bug, see Apple's support instructions.\n", "Q: Switched SIM cards but contacts are no longer on my iPhone? What do I need to do, once I have switched SIM cards on my iPhone, to get my contacts to appear?\n\nA: SIM cards can store a certain amount of contacts, but most phones nowadays do not automatically store them there, instead storing them on the phone itself. \nIf your old phone has stored your contacts on the SIM card, you can import them onto your iPhone in the Settings app: \nGo into Mail Contacts and Calendars, scroll down to the Contacts section, and tap on Import SIM Contacts. \nNote: iPhones CANNOT store contacts onto the SIM card. If your previous phone was an iPhone, you will need to sync them by some other method. \nMore Info: Apple Support Doc\n\nA: Sign into iCloud on your iPhone 4 (I know that it's an iPhone 4 due to this post by you as well) and they should appear. \n", "Q: A mysterious \"Other…\" user has appeared on my login screen I know this is often caused by enabling the root user, but checking the Directory Utility app — as instructed in other threads on this topic — has shown me that this user isn't at all enabled. \nOnly software I can think of that can be responsible for this is NoMachine which I use for remote access. But I just want to rule out malware at this point and figure how the hell can I get rid of this \"user\" (when I click on the its avatar I'm prompted to enter both a username and a password)\n\nA: Most likely you have recently installed an app that utilizes a new user account.\nNoMachine is one example. if you delete it, other... icon will be gone.\n\nA: The solution to this is to Disable Root User. To do that, go to:\n\nSystem Preferences > Users & Groups > Unlock Button (and put in\n  password) > Login Options > Network Account Server: click \"Join\" >\n  Open Directory Utility > Unlock Button (and put in password) > Edit\n  Menu (at the top) > DISABLE ROOT USER\n\nOnce you've done that, the Other... user should be gone from the login screen.\nAlternatively, you can get to Directory Utility using Spotlight (command + spacebar) then typing Directory Utility, and pressing enter.\nHope that helps!\n\nA: Once you review your accounts, the mystery will be revealed. Apple designed that item to let you enter a user name and password for system or other accounts from a directory server. It also can indicate if you allow guests to connect to your Mac in a secure manner.\n\nAbove is the guest access configuration on Catalina. In the past a lot of people enabled the root account, but more new macOS don’t need that and have protected system so any Admin user is really root or can become root in a shell on demand using the sudo command.\n", "Q: Help!

It refuses to open any more files; I can't even restart Finder.\nThe only solution I've come up with is to restart my entire computer to get Finder back to being responsive.\nHow can I eject this USB thumb drive without hanging Finder up like this?\n\nA: If you can not eject, then the next best thing to do is unmount the volume using the Disk Utility application. Once unmounted you can remove the device from the USB port.\nFor example, I have an mp3 player plugged in to my USB port. The volume has the label PEARL. If I highlight the volume the Unmount button will appear. \n\nIf I click on Unmount, the button will change to Mount. You will also notice the volume is no longer appears in the Finder.

I just updated my iPhone 5S to iOS 9. Things work well, but one setting I remember seeing in iOS 8.4 and earlier was the ability to enable/disable showing music purchases in iTunes seems to be gone.\nThis is quite annoying since I am old fashioned, don’t do streaming and like to have my music offline and directly on my iPhone. So music purchased from iTunes ends up having duplicate track entries. One for the MP3 on my iPhone and another for the iTunes purchased item that's there to let me download it again; see pic below:\n\nI checked all of the settings and even searched settings for the “Show iTunes Purchases” but all I can find is an option to enable/disable that for video content but not music; see pic below:\n\nSo what happened to this feature for music in iOS 9?\nAnd FWIW, when I go to “Settings -> Music” the “Show Apple Music” option is deactivated. And I am not using “iTunes Match” so that option is simply shown as “Subscribe to iTunes Match” so there is no “iCloud Music Library” in place to activate/deactivate.\n\nA: So this the ability to enable/disable showing iTunes purchases still exists, but it's not under settings. It’s right in the iTunes app itself.\nLaunch the app and then click on the pull down which allows you to select iTunes listings like by artist, album and all that; pic below for reference:\n\nWhen you click on it look at the bottom of the list.

(I'm running Yosemite).\n\nA: It depends: \nTimeMachine on WiFi\nTimeMachine does not backup if heavy traffic is going over the Network, there is something like Quality of Service running in the Background which throttles the upload speed to you TimeCapsule.\nAlso your WiFi Connection could be bad, as it was in my case. I did not recognise the bad connection with surfing (less upload and general only 8Mbit/s Speed) but 1,5GB to upload over a bad connection >1Mbit/s would take about 3 hours.\nTimeMachine on USB\nIs your drive full? Disks can operate in a performant way up to 80% of capacity, the they get significant slower. \nIs you drive old or defect? Sometimes drives are doing a lot of seeking and old drive have a high seek error rate, this will slowdown writing (especially at a >85% full disk an small files) \nAre the files small? Many small Files takes longer to get sorted and processed my the Time Machine. \nAre you using USB3? Make sure the drive is away from you Macbook, this helps sometimes with old USB3 Chipsets on external HDD enclosures. \nGeneral Suggestions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Turn on an Off you Mac\n\n*Make sure Hardware is okay (HDD test) \n\n*Make sure connection to TimeMachine is good\n\n*Type in Terminal: killall mdworker\n\n*Try Again ;) \n\n\nApples Suggestions:\nSlow Time Machine\nTry these suggestions if Time Machine is slow.\nThe first time you use Time Machine, set it up in the evening so that the initial backup can be done overnight.\nIf your backup disk is a Time Capsule, leave your Mac in the same room as the Time Capsule for the initial backup, or use an Ethernet cable to connect your Mac to one of the Ethernet ports on the Time Capsule.\nVirus scanning software can make Time Machine backups very slow. If you use Norton AntiVirus or a similar product, try to exclude your backup disk from automatic scanning. Also make sure you are running the latest version of the virus scanning software.\n Exported from Apple Support Site\nOS X Yosemite: If Time Machine remains in the “preparing” stage\nAfter the initial backup, Time Machine backs up only files and folders that have changed since your last backup. Time Machine displays a “Preparing...” message while it compares your current files and folders to those in the most recent backup.\nThe length of preparation time Time Machine requires depends on the amount of information on your Mac, the size of the backup, and the speed of the connection between your Mac and the backup disk.\n\n\n*\n\n*The preparation stage can also take longer if:\n\n*The previous Time Machine backup was interrupted.\n\n*The Mac wasn’t shut down properly.\n\n*A disk was disconnected from your computer before being ejected.\n\n*A software update was recently installed.\nYou used your Mac for several days without performing a backup. This can happen if the backup disk was disconnected.\nAntivirus software can also cause backups to require more time. Make sure your Time Machine backup folder, located on the backup disk and named “Backups.backupdb,” is excluded from virus scanning. Exported from this Apple Support Page\nLast but brutal tip:\nReformat the TimeCapsule or the TimeMachine drive and make a new initial Backup over Ethernet or USB.

Now since Windows 10 Final was released Apple is not openly providing Windows 10 drivers for MacBooks older than 2012. \nBootcamp driver version 5.1.xxxx intended for Windows 7/8/8.1 will install on Windows 10 and all peripherals, excluding the function keys, seem to work properly. Unfortunately, the function keys are a necessity because when my MacBook boots into Windows 10 the screen brightness is OFF; after a few minutes I guess the Bootcamp drivers engage and the function keys are usable.\nNow to the important questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is it possible to download/obtain the Windows 10 Bootcamp drivers without having Bootcamp 6? i.e. from the internet like version 5.1.\n\n*If a copy of the fresh Windows 10 drivers was obtainable, what is the outcome of the installation on a MacBook older than 2012?

Check the device tree with the app System Information and search for an appropriate string.\nWrap all that in a variable like $SDDiskToErase and hand it over to your diskutil eraseDisk command.\nUsing the above slightly modified line I got the diskIdentifier (disk2) of an external USB disk directly attached to my Mac:\nsystem_profiler -detailLevel mini | grep -A 30 0x1c26 | awk '/disk/ {gsub(\"BSD Name:\", \"\"); print $NF}'\ndisk2\n\nioreg:\nAnother initial command is ioreg -l | grep … (… is similar to the above) which is much faster (less than a second).\nAttach an SD-card and get its DiskIdentifier with diskutil list.

The disk is connected to a superior controller (the one in your monitor) visualized by the long vertical and short horizontal \"lines\" on the left in the dumb file. Use a characteristic and unique string of the controller like a serial number, IOName, deviceID etc. Then choose a number of subsequent lines for -A big enough to contain the diskIdentifier (e.g. disk6) but small enough not to contain the volume identifiers (e.g. disk6s1).\nExample:\nioreg -l | grep -A 350 0x100000214 | awk '/disk/ {gsub(\"\\\"\",\"\"); print $NF}'\ndisk2\n\nTo use the command in Apple Script you have to escape all inner \" and \\:\n\"ioreg -l | grep -A 10 SD/MMC/MS/MSPRO | awk '/disk/ {gsub(\"\\\"\",\"\"); print $NF}'\"\n\nbecomes:\ndo shell script \"ioreg -l | grep -A 10 SD/MMC/MS/MSPRO | awk '/disk/ {gsub(\\\"\\\\\\\"\\\",\\\"\\\"); print $NF}'\"\n\n", "Q: Boot Camp - Disadvantages Let's assume I've got a MacBook Pro, the latest version. Most of the time I'll spend time using OS X, but sometimes I would like play video games or use Visual Studio to develop. I don't really want to use a VM, because of the gaming part and it doesn't bother me to restart the computer, because of the SSD inside.\nMy questions are, what are the disadvantages of Boot Camp if I use OS X?\n\n\n*\n\n*Do I notice any perfomance issues over time? (Only on OS X, I don't care about Windows that much)\n\n*Can I extend the volume for the Windows OS?\n\n*Can I easily remove Boot Camp without any aftermath?\n\n\nThe reason for my question is simply that I would love to use OS X with all it's advantages.

Therefore I'm looking for a solution, which gives me a good time with Windows OS without any downsides using OS X, is Boot Camp the right choice, or should I use my old Windows laptop instead?\n\nA: on osx you won't notice any performance issues, windows is installed on its own partition and osx does not use it.\nYou can not (easily) extend the disk size of the bootcamp volume, you must prepare for the future when you install it for the first time.\nRemoving bootcamp is easy using the bootcamp assistant on osx, it removes the partition and restores your ssd to one osx partition.\nyou can always check here for further information\n", "Q: What does the shortcut picture with x within bounded right arrow mean?

My computer was lost in a fire. I am trying to find my music from my new iPhone but can only find music purchases from iTunes. Did I lose them? If not,how do I retrieve them?\n\nA: If you ever synced your iPhone or an iPod to the iMac before the fire, your music ripped from CDs could still be contained on these devices. You can then retrieve these songs from your device to your new computer using a program such as TouchCopy as detailed here\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/docs/DOC-3141\niTunes will only download your purchases to your new device, so if you haven’t synced it before, you may need to rip your CDs again.\n", "Q: Damaged iPad - what do I need to back up? I have an iPad Mini running iOS 9 that has music, photos, apps, etc on it, and I dropped it an shattered the screen. It still will connect to the computer. I have an appointment to get it \"repaired\" at the Genius Bar, but they really replace it with a fresh piece of hardware.\nWhat do I need to do to completely back up my iPad so that the new hardware will be as seamlessly like the old one as possible? Ideally, I'd like to have the same playlists, photos, settings, stored passwords, high score in games, etc. I have a Mac to back up to (and restore from).\nThis is an iPad with cellular service, so I plan to transfer the SIM from my current device to the new one.\nI've done a \"full backup\" in iTunes, but I want to be sure it really backs up everything. Does it? If not, what else do I need to do to make this as seamless as possible? Are there some things that I can't back up no matter what I do?\nWhen I spoke with a Genius Bar employee today, he indicated that playlists that I created on my iPad would not be backed up by any of these procedures. Does anyone have any experience with how to make the music on my iPad transfer as exactly as possible to the new hardware?\n\nA: To be safe, run two backups.\n\n\n*\n\n*First connect to iTunes and verify that \"Encrypt Backup\" (on the left) is checked. That will backup some private data that otherwise would be lost from the back up to your computer. Specifically, keychain and passwords, Health data on an iPhone.\n\n*Then try changing the password for the backups. This lets you know now that you can enter the password if/when prompted. If you can't change the password, delete the old backup and make a new encrypted backup to iTunes.\n\n*Lastly, put a clear piece of plastic over the screen and carefully go to Settings app and sign in to iCloud or go to iCloud and force a back up to iCloud. This is encrypted with the AppleID password and backs up passwords and health data as well as application data and settings.\n\n\nThere are things that do not back up like pairing records to trust specific computers, but those are by design and unlikely to be something you even want to back up if you could opt in to them.\nYour SIM will transfer most likely (all Apple iPads are not carrier locked) and the store staff can assist you if you should need some carrier activation step. I would arrive early (at least 15 minutes) for the appt and expect to be there 45 minutes. That way if the store is slammed, you won't be surprised by a delay. Most stores have a caching server and fast internet, so you might stay longer to get an iCloud restore going if your internet is more tortoise than hare.\nLastly, I don't know if cellular data boost works during an iCloud restore, so I wouldn't put the SIM card in the iPad while iCloud restore was running if paying for that amount of data is unwelcome.\n\nA: Just to expand on RedEagle's answer, before I even update iOS, let alone set up a new device, I would always, at the very last minute...\n\n\n*\n\n*Download any waiting App updates in iTunes\n\n*Sync [including copying any potential extra data, if asked at sync time]\n\n*Backup [with Encryption, to retain passwords/health data etc\nFor some vague existential reason, I don't fully trust iCloud to have everything as neatly & fully backed up as iTunes.\n", "Q: Is it unusual for \"Verify Disk\" on Disk Utilities to take so long on a Time Machine drive? I have an external 3TB FW800 drive set up to be my Time Machine drive. I noticed some unusually high drive activity, and opened up Time Machine to see if it was backing up. Nope, TM showed previous backup was done about 30-40 minutes prior, and there was no activity in the app.\nSo to be overly cautious, I popped open Disk Utility, selected the external drive, and started a \"Verify Disk.\" I've done this hundreds of times before on this and other drives...not talking about deep, hardcore tech support here. Simple stuff.\nWell, for some reason, it's taking a VERY long time. It's been moving along, progressing through the various steps, but after 30 minutes, it still estimates another 1hr 35mins to go. It has gotten to \"Checking multi-linked directories\" and been sitting there for about 10-15 mins.\nThe drive has worked flawlessly for over a year, and is about 85% full (hasn't started deleting old backups though), but I don't ever remember it taking THIS long to verify.\nIs there something about TM volumes that makes Verify Disk take longer, or should I be concerned about the hardware? What could be the reason for drive activity if TM wasn't backing up?\n\nA: The storage mechanism where each backup is a full backup is what takes so incredibly long to verify a Time Machine drive. The multi-linked directories is precisely why Time Machine makes the check so slow and precisely why each backup doesn't save two copies of the same file.\nYou can benchmark this by timing your Mac and see how long it takes to verify the source drive. That process is limited by the IO rate (or latency) of the storage subsystem. It doesn't read the contents of each file (which would measure the bandwidth of the storage subsystem).\nThe number of input-output operations per seconds (iops) can be graphed in Activity Monitor if you select that option.\n\nEach backup interval doubles the number of tops required by Disk Utility. Suppose your Time Machine backup drive contains two months of backups and your Mac doesn't sleep:\n\n\n*\n\n*24 backups - one per hour\n\n*31 backups - one per day (the rest are deleted/pruned)\n\n*4 backups - one per week (the rest are pruned)\n\n\nI could be off by one or two, but you're in the neighborhood of 60 copies of each file on your Mac that gets backed up (not all of them do - so maybe the discount is 15% of files don't back up). So if Disk Utility takes 15 minutes to check your Mac - the Time Machine drive will take 15 hours to check. That assumes the external drive is rated for the same iops as the internal drive - that typically isn't the case. You might estimate external drives are a factor of 2 slower due to iops being slower. \nNow you're 30 hours waiting (or 25 hours if you discount 15% of the files).\nIn practice, I can't check my Time Machine volumes since I have three macs backing up three months (or far longer) to one drive. I simply can't wait for that drive to get \"verified\" or \"fixed\". Instead I buy a second drive and rotate them weekly or monthly.\n", "Q: Cannot update OS X via the App Store This only happens with OSX updates, all general apps work fine.\nI click install to update to the latest version, I get a couple prompts confirming I want to download and allow my computer to restart.

After a recent and unsettling experience of having my iPhone stolen a few weeks ago, I have tried to harden the security settings on my new device. The old device has still not responded to a remote wipe request via Find My iPhone, so I presume that will never happen.\nOn the new device, I have turned on the \"Erase data\" setting in the Touch ID & Passcode settings: \"Erase all data on this iPhone after 10 failed passcode attempts\".\nI know that, in the event the erase happens, this will disable the Find My iPhone client on the device, but will it also disable the iCloud Activation Lock? That is, will someone be able to exploit deliberately the erase process to obtain a factory clean iPhone to use and activate as he wishes?\n\nA: Activation lock happens regardless of the content on the device.\nYou are protected since any wiped phone needs to check in with Apple's activation servers to determine if the device was purchased through DEP or is covered by an existing activation lock.\nYou don't have to worry about enabling a wipe conflicting with the inability of someone to activate the device down the road - they were designed and implemented to not conflict. Activation Lock works whether you wipe or not and without regard to how the wipe actually gets triggered.\n", "Q: Is it still possible to get @icloud.com email address? Set up a new iCloud account for someone and I am not seeing the option to set up an @icloud.com address and use the free email service. Does anyone know if this is still possible and how to go about doing this? \n\nA: The steps seem strange, but first you must create your appleid using a non Apple address (note that if you already have an @icloud, @mac, or @me email address that email address is already an Apple ID) \nOnce your Apple ID has been created, on the device go to Settings > iCloud and flip the mail switch on, you will be prompted there to create your @icloud.com email address.\nAlternatively, you can go to setting and go to mail. From there, add account and choose iCloud. If you choose \"create Apple ID\" at this screen, for whatever reason, it will allow you to create an \"@icloud.com\" email.\nsource Apple kb\n\nA: Using a Mac:\nSystem Preferences -> Internet Accounts -> (Maybe you need to click the +) -> Select iCloud on the right -> Create Apple ID -> Follow the steps\nAlso note that after entering your birthday, you should select \"Get a free iCloud email address\".\n\nA: iCloud accounts are different for different devices. If you are using iPhone, iPad or even an iPod Touch you can use iCloud. iCloud is Apple’s own icloud service which allows you to save all the data which is present on your iPhone on the online cloud. In order to use iCloud service, you will have to create icloud email address (@icloud.com).\nCreating a Free iCloud Email Address (@icloud.com) is really a very simple task and it doesn't take much time.  Here's how to create @icloud.com email address on an iPhone or iPad device:\n\n\n*\n\n*From the Home screen of your device, select Settings option and tap\non the iCloud button.  \n\n*If you are already logged in with any iCloud\naccount then log out. \n\n*After logged out, select Sign in to your iPhone\n\n*On the screen to enter your Apple ID, select Don't have an Apple ID or forgot it?\n\n\n*\n\n*Select Create Apple ID\noption. \n\n\n*Now, enter your Birthday, First Name and Last Name.  \n\n*Select Get a free iCloud email address\n\n*Now, enter the username which you want to use in your iCloud account. \n\n*To set up an @icloud email address confirm the process by selecting the\nCreate Email Address button.  \n\n*Enter a Password and confirm too. \n\n*Now to secure your iCloud account, you must enter a phone number that can receive a text message or phone call\n\n*Enter the verification code you receive via text or phone call\n\n*Finally agree to the Terms and Conditions. That’s it!  \n\n*You have just created a free icloud email address. Now enjoy!!\n\n\nThus, you can see how simple is to create a free iCloud email address (@icloud.com).\n\nA: You can use Apple's iCloud service without creating an @icloud.com email account.   I've had an iCloud account for ten years, and it does not have an @icloud.com email address, or any other apple email address, associated with it. My suggestion is to not even do what you ask.\n", "Q: How do I prevent FaceTime call notifications from exiting fullscreen apps on OS X? When I get a call through FaceTime, it switches away from a full screen app/video I'm using. I don't want to turn it off, because getting calls on the computer is useful, but I don't want it to automatically switch what I'm doing.\n\nA: Unfortunately there is no way to prevent an incoming Facetime call from interrupting your workflow.\nApple has a document that outlines what can be configured for Facetime on a Mac.\nhttps://support.apple.com/guide/facetime/change-preferences-fctm35545/mac \n\nA: I did some testing and the short version is you have to open your Facetime app and then minimize it. (command + M) or hide it. (command + H)  Minimizing turns the camera off, hiding leaves the camera on.\nUnlike Messages which doesn't have to process anything, Facetime has to open the app up, setup the window, and then process the call.  Since it has to setup the window when there are no windows open, it blinks to the default desktop tile for this, the first tile if it is unassigned and an app is using a designated desktop tile, and then allows the call to go through.  If you have already opened a window and just minimized it, then this doesn't have to occur, and it will process the call right away.\nFrom what I found, if you have it minimized/hidden and receive a call when watching Youtube/etc. full screen, it will pop up the notification bubble like Messages does and allow you to click on it to answer.  In some cases, if you click on the bubble itself and not the answer button, then it will tile shift still.  It seems to do this as well when the cancel call is pushed, but I need to test more.  I also haven't tested this when receiving an actual Facetime call as compared to a regular phone call, so nothing guaranteed there.\nSomething that will help is to set in System Preferences -> Users and Groups -> Login Items and add Facetime to this, then minimize whenever it opens.\n", "Q: iPhoto - find all photos that look like this photo? All, is there a way in iPhoto to find all the photos that look like a given photo? I suppose I could use Face, but it's actually not for a face, so that's a bit strange. For example, I'd like to tag my pet's photos with the pet's name. I also would like to find all the photos I took of plated food, etc.\n\nA: There's actually no way to do that in iPhotos/Photos.\nBut you should take a look at Google Photos which add this feature recently.\nAs far as I know iPhotos/Photos can only identify human faces, geotagged photos, panoramic photos (Photos only), in addition to various metadata (such as date, description…).\nNevertheless you can add tag manually (at least in Photos.app) by opening information related to the photo (cmd+i).\n", "Q: Mac Mini white screen - no recovery / no os installed I wiped (all partitions) a MacMini without knowing it was running bootcamp.

Among them are Slack, Intercom, and a few other team communication tools I use.\nI then resorted to Terminal, using the date command. Unfortunately, I found an issue: It reports the time is seven hours ahead of what it's supposed to be. I've tried a lot of random troubleshooting, looked in Console for errors, set the time manually, and all that other boring nonsense. I have no idea what's going on. I would love help troubleshooting this if you guys have any suggestions at all.\n\nA: I have a simular issue.   Only on start up/reboot MBP defaults to PST.  I go to Preferences and as soon as I unlock padlock it reverts back to EST.   \n\nA: Have you tried setting the date manually using the Terminal?\nSomething like this:\ndate {month}{day}{hour}{minute}{year}\n\nWhere every bracket should be replaced by a two digit number.

When I uploaded it to Google Drive the video was without slow-mo. Why is this so? Is this a bug?\nI have faced this issue also when uploading the slow-mo video on Hike and WhatsApp.\n\nA: Slow-mo videos are videos recorded in a higher framerate. To make them slower, Photos plays them back at a lower framerate. This is nothing to do with the file and everything to do with the playback of the file. When you upload the file elsewhere, it's still in a higher framerate, but you're playing it back at this higher framerate. If you want to watch it slower, use Photos to adjust the playback speed.\n\nA: Open in QuickTime\nCheck menu item View -> Play All Frames\nQuickTime is really underrated.\nWhat this does is basically tell the player not to drop frames, which it definitely will playing at 240fps, to satisfy a standard playback frame rate.

You can't easily expand it with Disk Utility booted from the internal main volume. To modify it you have to boot to Internet Recovery Mode or to an external boot drive. \nPreparation: \n\n\n*\n\n*Backup your data.\n\n*Detach any external drive (especially your external Time Machine backup drive).\n\n*Restart to Internet Recovery Mode by pressing alt cmd R at startup.\nThe prerequisites are the latest firmware update installed, either ethernet or WLAN (WPA/WPA2) and a router with DHCP activated.\nOn a 50 Mbps-line it takes about 4 min (presenting a small animated globe) to boot to a recovery netboot image which usually is loaded from an apple/akamai server.\nI recommend ethernet because it's more reliable.

When I try to boot my early 2015 mac book pro (with Yosemite) from this usb3 drive I have two options: windows or efi. If I select the efi option everything freeze and I need to hold down the power button to force a shutdown. If I select windows option instead everything works well.\nWith an usb2 flash drive, instead, the efi option can load the live kali linux distribution.\nWhy this behavior? What the differences between windows and efi options?\nThanks.\n\nA: When you refer to the two options: windows or efi, I assume each is a label given to separate icons that can appear when you hold down the alt/option key at startup. In this context, the label windows is a legacy term. It means you will be doing a BIOS boot of an operating system or operating system installer.\nEFI is obviously an EFI boot. The version of EFI is uncertain. I had an interesting discussion with Rod Smith (of rEFInd fame) over at Ask Ubuntu and he was able to convince me that no Mac's have a UEFI. This includes your early 2015 mac book pro. So if you do an EFI boot and everything works, this just means the kali linux distribution was designed to work with your Mac.\nAs for the USB2 verses USB3 issue, I suppose kali does have USB3 support for a BIOS boot but, does not for an EFI boot. When using a USB2 flash drive, your Mac's USB3 ports operate in legacy USB2 mode.\nFunny thing, I have read here at Ask Different where others claim 2015 Mac's can not do Microsoft Windows operating system BIOS boots. I find it interesting that you can with linux.\n", "Q: Add an extra line to addresses in Contacts in iOS? I need to add an address with more than 2 lines.

When I browse to upload images to a photo-sharing website, or email, I can't locate the library that the newer pictures are in. It only shows one of the libraries. How do I get it to browse in both libraries? I don't see a way to choose more than one library. \n\nA: Photos can have any number of Libraries, but by default, it opens the last open library when you click on the Photos icon. To open other Libraries, hold down the Option key when clicking on the Photos icon. This will pop-up a dialog, showing you the available Photos libraries.\nPhotos sync's new photos from iCloud (say from your iPhone or iPad) to only one of the libraries, and that library must be declared as the System library. Perhaps you are not seeing new photos because the library that is opening is not the System Library.\nYou will see which Library is the System Library when you hold down the Option key and open Photos: that library will have 'System Photo Library' next to it. This one will have your new photos in it.\nIf you want a different library to be the System Library, simply open that other library (as mentioned above), then in Photos, choose Preferences>General> Use as System Library. This will cause your iCloud photos to sync with this Library.\nThere is no a way to browse all images across all libraries, each are separate. Photos does not have a way to open multiple libraries at the same time. If you only want one library, you can simply import photos from the other library into your System Library, by using the Import function, and navigating to the other Photo library, typically found in your Pictures folder.\n\nA: The photos picker that is part of the open file dialog only looks at the system library which is typically the current one. \nYou can open photos and switch libraries, set up a script to automate at process or consolidate your photos into one library - each has drawbacks, but hacking the photo picker is worse than the alternatives I've presented. \n", "Q: Set user expiration Yosemite server.app How do you set local network user expiration using server.app? \nThis action would block the user to log in after a given date.\n\nA: In order to change a user's expiration, in the Server.app you need to go to \"Users\", then make sure that \"Local Network Users\" are chosen (using \"All Users\" keeps that option greyed out).  Then highlight that user in question and from the cogwheel button below the list choose \"Edit Password Policy\".\nThere you will find all the \"missing options\" like password complexity as well as expiration for various reasons.\n", "Q: Upgraded to iOS 9.0.1 and lost all health weight data I just upgraded my iPhone (model MG5D2LL/A) to iOS 9.0.1 yesterday, and I did one backup restore to resolve an issue with the Podcast app (still not resolved).\nI lost most of my Health app data. I lost all of my manually entered weight data (several years worth) and my Medical ID. For some reason the dashboard is still showing the last 7 days of steps, walking, climbing data.\nIs there any way to recover that data?\n\nA: Backups don't backup health data unless they're encrypted backups.\nThus, if you restore one of these unencrypted backups, you won't restore the health data. This data is gone—it's not stored in iCloud for privacy reasons.\n\nA: Same happened to me this morning.

This is not the user or admin login password.

Pretty stuck here!\nThis is the message I get from iTunes (12.3.0.44) when trying to manually backup my iPhone 4S (iOS 8.1.2)\nto my Mac (Mac Book Pro Yosemite 10.10.5).\nThis is what happened until now:\n\n\n*\n\n*Last sync was on another computer (old Windows laptop), this is the\nfirst time trying to backup/sync on this Mac \n\n*iPhone is full (I want\nto backup the data and then to cleanup) \n\n*Mac has 55GB free space\n\n*Backup wouldn't start, reported not enough space (a different\nmessage!) to sync \n\n*Cleaned the lockdown folder as suggested by Apple\n\n*Backup had started but reported an error about a \"session could not\nbe started\" \n\n*Restarted the device while connected to Mac (as\nsuggested on some forum) \n\n*Backup had started but reported this\nmessage (\"iPhone XXX cannot be synced because there is not enough\nfree space to hold all of the selected items.\")\n\n\nAny ideas?\nEDIT 2017: I no longer use this phone, eventually I didn't find a solution.\n\nA: When you start syncing your iDevice in iTunes and then you get this annoying message (especially when it tells you it needs like 1.4MB and there is 300MB available?!): 'The iPhone/iPad “iPhone(insert name)” cannot be synced because there is not enough free space to hold all the selected items'. What do you do?\nBasically the problem, in many cases, seems to be that iTunes thinks it has too many updates to install on your iPhone/iPad and it isn't smart enough to load them one at a time when there's not enough space to do them all??\nFortunately it can often be side-stepped by just taking your iPhone/iPad and clicking on the App Store app,  then tapping on the Updates tab, and then tapping on 'Update All' at the top right. If that  complains that there's not enough space you can let do some updates then try again (and again) and will update the rest of the apps. Then the sync should be fine with iTunes. \n\nA: I fixed my issue today.\nOur iPhone 5 with 32 gigs had no issue syncing or backing up; however or iPhone 6 with 128 gig was causing the \"lack of disk space\" error message.  I emptied my trash bin freeing up 30 gigs but still not luck.  \nAfter doing some research, I deleted the last backup of the iPhone 6 as some users said it may be corrupted.  Once I did that, I was able to do a backup on Iphone6.  Then I was able to sync with no issue!\nHope this helps some of you.  Good luck.  Just disappointed that Apple does not help at all!!!!! \n\nA: I experienced a similar problem. So what I did was connect my iPhone 6S to the iTunes with which it was earlier synced. From there I deleted all the music, movies, and photos from my iPhone. After deleting the media I connected my phone to my new mac and it synced perfectly without showing that error message again. Hope this works for you as well.\n\nA: I was experiencing the same problem:\n\n\n*\n\n*iPhone Xs Max 256 GB with 171 GB free\n\n*MacBook Pro with 300+ GB free\n\n\niTunes told me not enough space to backup.\nAnd eventually was able to fix it.\nI thought 256 - 171 = 94 GB would be needed as a maximum. Minus some iOS system data that wouldn't need to be backed up. My previous backup on my MacBook Pro using iTunes was 81 GB so that indeed looked correct. With an efficient process that would make sense.\nBut it wasn't\nTried all kinds of different things to fix it. Enabling/disabling encrypting. Changing encryption password. Removing previous iTunes backups. Enabling/disabling iCloud backups. Using different cables. Rebooting. Disk Utility First Aid (in Recovery Mode). DaisyDisk cleanup of hidden space. Disabling Time Machine automatic backups and removing the Time Machine disk. Deleting all local Time Machine snapshots.\nNone of these steps individually enabled me to backup without an error message.\nIn the end what actually fixed it for me:\n- I removed as many files as need on my MacBook Pro to get up to 350 GB of free space.\n- Retried iTunes backup. It worked!\nSo apparently in my case I needed even more than 256 GB of free space to perform the iTunes backup. The 300+GB I started out with wasn't enough.\nReason why? I don’t know. It did work.\nAn hypothesis could be that because your iPhone is encrypted it first copies an entire 256 GB image of your iOS installation to your Mac and then needs extra free space (maybe up to your actual backup file size) to create the actual final backup file.\nGive it a try.\n\nA: I just ran into this issue with my 128 GB iPhone XR in 2019. It had over 50 GB free but suddenly iTunes was saying that it needed another 1.3 TB of space to fit my synced data! This was pretty unreal since nearly nothing had changed between syncs (and in fact only a week had passed). I was very fortunate to discover that some of my very old m4a files were unreadable by iTunes. It had determined that they were each 768 hours long and refused to play. For some reason this happened to 3 of my albums, all by one artist. Several of these songs had been synced to my iPhone previously without any issues, and a few had even been played just a few days prior.\nTo my knowledge, nothing else in my library was affected. Once I removed those files from my library, the sync ran without issue.\nUnfortunately, I just got lucky in finding these files. I don't have a sure-fire method for locating them yourself. You could try viewing your library by Songs view, ensure it displays the Time and Size columns, and sort by each of those columns to see if anything weird shows up. Also, try singling out your m4a files before suspecting mp3's.\nWhat's even stranger is that the m4a files are actually fine. They play in VLC without complaint. I tried removing them from iTunes and re-adding with no luck. My final solution to get the files playable again was to use an online converter to change them from m4a to mp3. Transcoding lossy to lossy is never ideal, but it worked. I regained these songs in iTunes and my phone syncs without complaint.\nThis was in Windows 10, iTunes 12.9.4.102, iOS 12.2.\n\nA: I fixed this by applying a pending iOS update on my phone (Settings app > General > Software Update).\nI'm not sure how this fixed the problem though. According to my phone, it had not downloaded the updated yet (I had to tap \"Download and Install\" on the phone to start the update), and even if it had, there was still plenty of space left on my phone. For what it's worth, the update was from 10.4 to 10.4.1.\nUpdate: I ran into this problem again the next time I tried to sync. (Strangely, this time it needed over 120gb of space which is the entire size of my phone!)\nI fixed it this second time by doing a forced restart of the phone, then re-syncing worked.\n\nA: figured it out, you have to uncheck the encrypt iphone backups.  give that a go and click back up!\nI tried this and it seems to be working for me - I have NO idea why, but a dozen other ideas didn't work at all.  I untucked the 'encrypt' box, and tried sync again, and now it's proceeding as usual.  To be clear, I had the error where there was plenty of room for the back up and sync (asked for 1.1 Mb, said I only had 5 Gb) - but then it was saying that there wasn't enough room.  Once it's synced, I'll retick the box and hopefully it will all be back to normal.\n", "Q: How do I change the phone number ID on iMessage on iPad? I get messages on my iPad from my wife's iPhone but not mine.\nOn messages, her number is listed as an ID but I can't change it to mine. How do I change it?\n\nA: The only way to register a phone number as a Receiving/Sending id on iMessage, is via an iPhone. \nMeaning: you can only register an iMessage phone number as an id if you have access to that phone number and you activate your iMessage account with it on an iPhone. \nIf you want your iPad to receive your iMessages (sent to your phone number) you have to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Activate iMessage on your iPhone with your phone number and Apple ID (your carrier might charge you for this process);\n\n*[On your iPad] Go to Settings -> Messages -> Enable iMessage.\n\n*Then, on Send & Receive make sure the Apple ID is the same as in your iPhone and your Phone Number should be listed.\n\n\nIf you have already activated iMessage on your iPhone, on your iPad under Send & Receive you just have to log in with the same Apple ID as in your iPhone. \nI also advise you to set the same id for Start New Conversations From on all your devices.\n\nA: Go to Settings -> Messages -> Send & Receive and you can change what phone numbers and email addresses you receive iMessages from.\nThe problem is likely that you are signed into your wife's iCloud account somewhere in iOS. Look at the \"Apple ID\" line in blue at the top of the settings pane I took you to. If that's not it, check Settings -> iCloud.\n", "Q: How to fix sync issues in multi-output device? When I'm listening to music (iTunes) during the day, I'd like to have sound all around me.  So I've created a multi-output device out of my main audio interface (Propellerhead Balance) and my portable Bluetooth speaker (MagicBox II).  Unfortunately there is a significant sync issue between the two.  I'm not surprised that the audio signal would be delayed slightly with Bluetooth, but then I had hoped that the hardware interface would match the delay to compensate.  This is clearly not the case.  I have tried enabling drift compensation but it made no difference at all.\nIs there a way to make this setup work with both output devices in sync?\n\nA: The only solution I've found is to use the third party app AirFoil Speakers and use my iPad as the receiver for my \"rear channel\" audio (the BT Speaker).  I found an article documenting some debug settings that include per-device sync adjustments:  \n\nTo enable the sync adjustment, follow these steps:\n1) Quit and re-launch Airfoil while holding down the option key. This\n  will bring up the debugging window.\n2) Turn the Sync Adjustment debugger to On, and click Done.\nNow each remote speaker will have an additional slider below the\n  volume slider - that's the sync adjustment. The center is 0 offset,\n  and the ends are +/-1 second. Adjustments only take effect when\n  connecting, so if you're experimenting with it, you'll need to\n  disconnect, adjust, and then reconnect to see how well it worked.\n\nVery handy and works well once dialed in!  It's unfortunate that in addition to the BT speaker already purchased, this solution also needs both a commercial 3rd party app as well as an expensive iOS device, but unless there is an option somewhere within the Mac OS to adjust sync in a similar fashion but for hardware audio devices, this is going to have to do (and I'm fortunate to already have the iOS device).\n", "Q: Can the default for 'remind me at location' be changed to 'Arriving' in Reminders.app? When you create a location based reminder in Reminders.app, you are given two options to trigger the alert: 'Leaving' and 'Arriving'.\nI don't know if this is uncommon, but I have never needed the 'Leaving' option. When I use a location based reminders is often related to things I need to do, people to talk, or things to pick up at that location. A reminder when I leave is not exactly useful for those kinds of tasks.\nAnyway, the problem is that I'm sick of having to manually change the selection to 'Arriving' for every reminder.\nDo you know if there is a way to somehow change the default to be always 'Arriving'?\nI'm on Yosemite 10.10.5.\n\nA: Answering my own question:\nI just upgraded to OS X 10.11 El Capitan, and found out that the default has been changed to \"Arriving\" for location based reminders.\nSo it seems it was not just me..\n", "Q: How to avoid auto-disable Low Power Mode on iOS9 when charging In iOS9, when Low Power Mode is activated, and you are charging your iPhone, when charge percentage gets to 80%, the iPhone disables Low Power Mode automatically.\nIs there any way to avoid this automatic change and let Low Power Mode remain activated?\n\nA: Just tested this - you can get Siri to turn low power on which saves navigating to the Battery settings screen.

However, the problem with differential backups of packages is that the contents relies on other parts of the contents. You can't restore part of a package—it'll break the entire package. The solution to this is just to replace the previous package backup on backup.\n", "Q: In OSX App Store exist a update for a app that is not installed, and can't be I have installed a app with a different ID/Store, but is not longer in my system.

I have come to the beginning of a new year on my developer license with Apple.  At this time I am able to remove old devices from the account:\n\nUnfortunately there are several applications that are deployed to testers that have those old devices on the provisioning profiles.  When I remove the old device UDID's the provisioning profiles with the removed UDID's will be invalid.  Does this mean that at some point, my testers' apps will phone home and stop working until I can redeploy with regenerated provisioning profiles?  Or will they just keep working until their profile expires?\nEffectively, I think I'm asking if Apple maintains a revocation list for provisioning profiles as well as signing certificates, and if deletion of a device would trigger revocation.\n\nA: I don't think that Apple reaches out and revokes certificates on devices when you wipe the slate clean, but they would be in their right to do so and they have the capability to do so.\nMost likely, those devices will work until a certificate (or intermediate in the trust chain) expires. Or until the \"testers\" remove the app or wipe the device or remove the trust profile.\n", "Q: Horrible high pitched noise from iSight mic only under OSX My old 2008 Macbook's iSight microphone is acting up but only under OSX.

To fix it go to the MIDI setup (i.e. by Spotlight Search Bar). On the left side choose your USB microphone (USB camera) and on the right try to change frequency to 44 100Hz and format 16-bit. Previously I had 24-bit which causes the problem. \n\nA: The immediate cause of the noise is feedback from the speakers is being amplified by the microphone.\nTo get out of the loop mute the speakers or plug in headphones. Then go to the sound system preference pane and dial down the gain on the iSight camera microphone.\nIf you can't live with a gain level that is below the feedback loop, you may need to seek hardware repair. Before that, I'd install a clean OS onto an external USB drive and be sure you don't have any software issues or settings.\nDepending on the cost of the repair, you can use an external microphone, use better care with the levels of input/output, use headphones when recording to avoid fixing the root cause if it's actually a hardware issue. That's an unlikely outcome as you've not reproduced it under windows - so focus on software first.\n", "Q: How do I connect an external display to my Macbook Pro? I have a Macbook Pro (Late 2013). I'm trying to mirror the display on a LG M2035A. The monitor accepts VGA input. The monitor comes with a VGA cable. So, I purchased a HDMI to VGA converter, to connect to the monitor. However, my Macbook doesn't seem to detect the external display. I think my VGA and HDMI cable function properly, because when I connect the monitor using this to my laptop running Windows, it functions perfectly. Is there a workaround, or something I'm missing? \n\nA: DVI is far, far superior in terms of the Mac sensing the capabilities of the display and in terms of quality. Go that method if you can.\nIf your VGA adapter isn't working with OS X, you could contact the adapter vendor for support. Not all of them are high quality and even the high quality ones don't work with all displays/projectors.\n", "Q: Mac Pro 3.1 with Yosemite won't boot after GenericUSBXHCI USB 3.0 .kext added I was trying to install drivers for my NEC USB 3.0 PCI card.\n( propably http://sourceforge.net/projects/genericusbxhci/files/\nor https://github.com/RehabMan/OS-X-Generic-USB3 )\nI rebooted my mac into \n    kext-dev-mode=1\nthen i typed:\n    sudo kextcache -m /System/Library/Caches/com.apple.kext.caches/Startup/Extensions.mkext /System/Library/Extensions\nGenericUSBXHCI .kext was enabled.

Only about half of those are currently subscribed to.  When I look at my list of episodes in iTunes, the whole list always appears in alphabetical order. I do not want to delete my old unsubscribed podcasts from my library, but it would be really nice if there were some way to either hide (and later show) the unsubscribed podcasts, or sort the list so that subscribed podcasts appear at the top. Are either of these possible?\n\nA: There doesn't seem to be an automatic sort option to send currently subscribed podcasts to the top of the list. I have the same complaint (among others) with the podcast capabilities of iTunes. There are a couple of ways you can do this manually though.\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a station and only include the podcasts you are currently subscribed to in it.  \n\n*In the \"My Podcasts\" view, click the \"Podcasts\" drop-down menu (top right) and sort by \"Playlist Order\". You can then drag & drop to reorder your podcasts in the left hand pane.\n#2 is what I do. You can quickly see whether or not you've subscribed to a podcast when you select it - if you're subscribed it will say \"Updated xxxxx\" under the podcast title. If you aren't, it will say \"Not subscribed\" along with the last updated date.\nA bit annoying, but it seems that this is the only option. There may be a way to generate a playlist using some scripting, but from looking at the iTunes library file I don't see any information in there that indicates whether or not a podcast is subscribed to.

Once both are under their respective quoaptas, the warnings will go away. \n", "Q: What is \"x-apple-ql-id://*\"? I have a process called x-apple-ql-id://* (* being a bunch of letters, numbers and \"-\"). Is this a legitimate process? I am wondering because it looks very fishy.\n\nA: That seems to be a legitimate process. It's a schema that belongs to QuickLook, but Apple doesn't have much information freely available about it. I don't think is a reason to be alarmed, just kill the process (but save your work before, just in case).\n", "Q: Good GTD/todo/tasks app I am looking for a free task management application that has the following:\n- Reminders for tasks that can be snoozed (like native reminders app)\n- Grouping tasks/Adding subtasks\n- UI showing tasks per day/week\n- Prioritize task   \nI tried Wunderlist and Todoist. Wunderlist has a very nice interface but can not snooze tasks. Todoist also is missing time setting per task.\nAnydo seems not working properly. Sometimes I get a popup others not.\nWhat can you recommend?  \nUpdate:\nI have checked the apps in the linked post. They are not meeting my requirement. None offers snooze\n\nA: I like Clear. \nIt has reminders that can be snoozed. The snooze time is not optional (unlike the default Reminders app). When you snooze, it simply snoozes for 15 minutes. \nYou can create any number of categories under which to put tasks. \nYou can very easily prioritize tasks. \nIt doesn't really have a \"today\" or \"this week\" view except as a widget in Notification Center. \nThe UI is unbelievably easy and efficient to use. \n", "Q: Should I play games natively on Mac OS when they are available? Lots of games are available for Mac:\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/search/?term=&sort_by=_ASC&os=mac&page=1\nShould I play them on Mac or should I boot into Windows 10? (I have a copy of Windows 10 already so buying it is not an issue).\n\nA: tl;dr: Play games on the platform where you want more games available in the future.\nSome software work better on certain platforms. Many applications, especially games, are usually made with mainly Windows in mind*, and only afterwards ported to other platforms. Sometimes companies/developers don't invest enough money/time/effort on making the non-Windows versions work quite as well. Of course, the reverse may be true too, but usually PC games are primarily targeted at Windows users.\nDepending on how you want to shape the world, you have a couple of choices:\n\n\n*\n\n*Full OS X: If you want more games on OS X in the future, play as many of those games on OS X as possible. More gamers on non-Windows platforms makes developing games for non-Windowses a more viable and attractive business for game companies.\n\n*Fifty-fifty, the golden mean: just try out both versions and see for yourself which one works better.\n\n*Full Windows: If you're serious about PC gaming, and don't care about affecting the status quo, Windows is your best bet, as that's where most of the games are.\n* since that's what most PC gamers use (which, in turn, is because that's the platform that most games are made for, because that's where the most PC gamers are, etc.)\n", "Q: How do I temporarily enable package installation without any permission prompt Whenever I need to install an app using the package installer, there will be a prompt asking for admin user's name and password. How do I temporarily turn this feature off, so that any package can be installed automatically?\n\nA: You'll want to go into your System Preferences, and into Security & Privacy\n\nThen unlock - if needed - the lock on bottom left, and select \"Anywhere\".\nThe computer might ask you for your password.\n\nWhen you're done, you should be able to open and install many .DMG installers without being prompted for a password.\nWhen you are done, you can revert these settings as they are a good security to prevent third party apps from installing automatically on your computer.\n", "Q: Can I make/receive phone calls with phone number attached to iPad's Verizon account? Just a few days ago I got an iPad Air 2 via Verizon. On the account, there is a phone number associated with the line for the tablet. Is that number functional? I guess what I mean is, can you answer phone calls or make calls with the number associated with the tablet? I've tried calling the number from a different number and nothing happens, but I'm not sure if it's just me.\nIf it is supposed to be a functional number then is there a way for me to add that number to an already existing Apple ID that is associated with my iPhone phone number?\n\nA: It serves only to make Verizon's back end provisioning work. You can't call to it, you can't call from it, you now just know it's not a \"real live telephone number\". \nPretty silly as there's a limited number of numbers that can exist in any one area code, but that's how things are engineered at present. Other carriers do the same thing, so it's not just vzw. \n", "Q: Is there a way to rotate multiple photos at once in the camera roll? In iOS on the iPhone I only see a way to select one photo at once in order to then rotate it in the Photos app.\nIs there a method or perhaps a third-party app that could perform this?\n\nA: There's no way to do this without a third-party app or a shortcut at the moment.\n\n*\n\n*If you have a Mac and you are using iCloud Photos sync, you can do it in the Photos app\n\n*If you're ready to pay for an app, OneEdit Pro will do the job\n\n*You can also use a shortcut like this one : Batch Rotate Images\n", "Q: Why does Mac OS X turn off monitor #2 when an application is maximized on monitor #1? I am running OS X Yosemite 10.10.5 on a Mac Mini system with two monitors. When I maximize an application on monitor 'A', monitor 'B' then goes black while that application maximizes to fill 'A'.\nWhy the heck is this happening? How do I fix it?\nThanks!\n\nA: Why?\nPersonally,. because I don't think they ever thought it through properly. There's a lot about fullscreen that's like that. \nThe fix is possibly System Prefs > Mission Control > check Displays have separate Spaces\n\nThe better fix is don't use fullscreen, use Alt/click on the green button to maximise instead.\n", "Q: iPad Air 2 iOS 9/9.0.1 multitasking split view won't work My IPad Air 2 (model number: MGKM2LL/A,  Apple iPad Air 2 ‑ Wi‑Fi ‑ 64 GB ‑ 9.7\" ‑ Silver) will not go into split view mode half of the screen, it will only go to the smaller bar 1/3 of the screen. I used the split view mode once but now the slide bar doesn't show up, I can't make the smaller bar get more than 1/3 of the screen, and I can't use two apps simultaneously. This problem occurred when my iPad was on iOS 9 and I updated it again to iOS 9.0.1 and the problem is still happening.\n\nA: after activating the \"Slide Over\" 1/3 pane, drag the split edge to center of screen\n", "Q: Numbers: Line graphs for cell values across multiple worksheets I want to create a line graph whose reference data is across multiple worksheets.\nFor example: I have 5 different worksheets (named W1 to W5)\nIn each of the worksheet, a specific cell (Ex: B2) in a specific table (Ex: Tab_Summary) is of interest to me.\nI want to plot a line graph to show trends of (Tab_Summary:B2) across each of the worksheets W1 to W5.\n\nA: Hopefully someone knows how to source data from multiple table inputs, but I just use brute force and make one table that contains all data I need to chart. Tables can refer to data from multiple other tables, so now with your charting data in one table, charting becomes a snap. \n", "Q: Program to assign mouse button chords? Is there an app to assign actions (such as shortcut keys) to mouse button chords?\nFor example, button 1 + button 4 = Cmd+C, button 4 alone = Cmd+V, etc.\nI have tried a few utilities, but none of them support assigning a custom action to two buttons pressed at the same time.\n\nA: Better Touch Tool can do what you want, and can even be set up to do so on a per-app basis. \n", "Q: Python interpreter crashes on execution having bought my first macbook I am not very experienced in debugging the libraries and a bit at a loss.

What is broken, wrongfully linked or otherwise? Any help is appreciated!\n\nA: Welcome to software debugging. That topic is too broad to convey in a short answer here, but hopefully some context and guidelines will help.\n\n\n*\n\n*Your Python program itself crashed - so you don't easily know what call or sequence of calls caused the error from the container crashing. \n\n*Gather details like what version of Python is running, what version of each library.\n\n*Try enabling debug flags for the libraries or run the python script in a python debugger so you can know where the crash ocurrs. \n\n\nOnce or have that level of detail, you'll start to isolate the issue by reducing the complexity of the code by removing all that's necessary to either stop crash or have a minimal example of the crashing behavior (say 10 lines of Python plus whatever data setup is needed) and ask about that in Stack Overflow. \n", "Q: DRM Free Music With iTunes Match & Apple Music? If I'm right about this ... iTunes Match uploads files you already have and gives you back DRM free versions in a better quality? \nand ... \nApple Music lets you download any file in iTunes library, but with DRM? \n... I'm sure this won't be the case but, if you have both, do you get unlimited downloading of DRM-free music downloads from Apples library?\n\nA: When using iTUnes Match you will be able to download a copy of your mp3 file (256 Kbps) from iTunes servers directly to your devices DRM-free.\nIf your file B.mp3 doesn't match any B.mp3 file on iTunes servers, then your file is uploaded to your iTunes Match account (same quality as local file) and it can be downloaded on other devices DRM-free. \nEvery file available on Apple Music has DRM, meaning: all the files you save for offline listening aren't DRM Free. Also, some files on Apple Music aren't available in every region.\nHope this helped! \nEDIT\nCorrected answer regarding the DRM state of iTunes Match files.

I was using the Utility face on my Apple watch and love the ability to tap the bottom and see my meetings. \n\nThe time-lapse faces are compelling, but I'm really missing the calendar complication. \n\nI'd like to combine them. \nMy question is: Is it possible to get the 'next meeting 'complication on top of the time-lapse watch face? \n\nA: No. Watch OS 2.0 doesn't include a kit to make changes like that. You could get Xcode and make your own complication, but even registered developers don't get to make custom watch faces yet. \nYou'd need to be Hermès and work directly with Apple to get that done on iOS 9 and watch OS 2. \n", "Q: Can I delete the video part of a Live Photo and just keep the photo? I want to shoot all my photos as Live Photos but only if I can quickly review and delete the video part of the Live Photo to save space. Is this possible?\n\nA: Starting with iOS 9.3 and macOS El Capitan 10.11.4, Photos can strip the video portion of a Live Photo natively.\n\n\n*\n\n*On your Mac, right-click the Live Photo, then Duplicate 1 Photo.  \n\n*On iOS, open the Share Sheet from your Live Photo, then tap Duplicate.\n\n\nSelect Duplicate as Still Photo, and you are then free to delete the original Live Photo.\nYou can even select multiple Live Photos and process them as a batch this way. This can prove especially useful starting with iOS 10.3 and macOS Sierra 10.12.4, which provide a new built-in smart album containing all your Live Photos. Simply go into Albums view and scroll down to Live Photos right below Selfies.\n\nA: Just open your live photo in photos, tap on share, then duplicate and then choose \"duplicate as still image\". Then just delete the original live photo.\n\nA: Since the size of the live video portion of the image (sound and frames) is generally twice the size of the still. On iOS 10 the edit function on iOS only hides the data and doesn't strip or free the space.\n\n\n*\n\n*iPhone 6s and 6s Plus captures  4032 x 3024 in landscape \n\n*The average of 10 still images is 1.95 MB\n\n*The average size of the 10 corresponding live videos is 3.67 MB - this inlcudes the sound and motion portion of the data. \n\n\nYou can also strip the video easily by connecting either phone to Photos v 11.1 app and you will see both the \"traditional still\" photo and the associated video file to import.   \n\nA: There's an app on the App Store called Lean that does just what you're asking. I haven't used it myself, but it does comes recommended from CNET---http://www.cnet.com/how-to/this-free-app-helps-eliminate-the-live-photos-you-dont-want/ ---and it's free so it's worth a shot.\nFor quick results, one could just take a screenshot (press lock and home button together) of the image and delete the original Live Photo.\nHowever, when I imported some Live Photos I took on my iPhone 6S into Photos on my MacBook Pro I was given the regular photo and what appeared to be the Live Photo, separately.\n\nA: You are able to delete the live photo part be entering the edit mode of a live image. Tapping the live photo symbol there will deactivate it and removes the live part of the photo.\n\nA: You can remove the video portion by editing the photo on your iOS device. When viewing a Live Photo, tap on Edit, and then make an adjustment. I've found any changes made using the tools will prompt an alert, letting you know any changes made will remove the video portion. On the other hand, using the \"magic wand\" to automatically optimize the photo will not remove the video.\n\nA: I am using the app called Lean, it does the job very well. You can download it at here: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/lean-clean-up-your-live-photos/id1051075379?mt=8\nI read the review about this app before at http://foxyios.com/tips/how-to-remove-the-video-part-of-a-live-photo\n\nA: On Yosemite Photos.app displays video portion separately from JPEG portion*. You can delete the video portion, in my testing the JPEG portion remains. The deleted video portion is seen in \"Show Recently Deleted\" and when permanently deleted (\"Delete All\") the JPEG persists.\n\n\n*\n\n*My wife accidentally turned Live Photo so I had to delete hundreds of videos. For some I'm not seeing the expected separate video though she though she was doing still images.\n\n\nA: The simplest way to achieve this is to enable My Photo Stream in iCloud Photos settings as it strips the video from all Live photos when viewed in 'My Photo Stream'.\nIf your device is synced with Mac OS/X Photos then it also has the [unexpected] affect of not storing the video portion of the live photos - so it will only keep the still image.\n\nA: If these photos are under MacOS (or have been exported to a particular folder), fire a terminal in this folder and:\nmv *.pvt/*.HEIC .\nrm -r IMG*.pvt\n\nThis will move the still photo out of the bundle and suppress it.\n", "Q: Fetching problem with Macports I'm running macports on a late 2013 MBP.

I force ejected without thinking, because I really didn't think any of my files were in use (I checked the usual places like whether a video file was playing somewhere etc.) When I try to plug it back, I realise it doesn't read or appear on finder. I've restarted my computer and still nothing. Other hard drives work so its definitely an isolated problem. Any ideas? \nUpdate: I can't do a Disk Utility repair? the option isn't even available\n\nA: You should be able to see your drive in Disk Utility, even though the data may be corrupted, so you may need to wipe the drive in order to make it usable again.\n\nA: The solution of this problem can be chkdsk command from windows.\nIt doesn't require admin privilegies, so you can do this at work\nConnect your disk at Windows PC. It will appear as [drive letter]\nPress Win-R, and then type chkdisk [drive letter]: /f Press Enter.\nWhen the process finishes, safely remove disk through windows tray and, have a happy day!\n", "Q: IOS9 Video Scrubbing In IOS8 it was possible to scrub through videos without first pressing the play button.

Is there a good plugin that automatically saves downloaded files via Safari in different folders depending on the file type? Or maybe a plugin that let's you put a few destinations in the context menu? So that you could choose \"Save in Pictures\" \"Save in Music\" etc. right in the right click menu.\n\nA: I don't know of any Safari extension doing this but you may use Automator to create a folder action attached to your preferred download folder sorting files according to their extension or kind to various folders. That's even independent from the browser you usually use.\nThe article here outlines the workflow which sorts *.dmg and pictures:\n\nCreate the workflow\n  In the Finder, create two folders on the Desktop. Name the first Disk Images and the second My Pictures.\nLaunch Automator (in your /Applications folder) and in the workflow template that appears choose Folder Action and click Choose. In the resulting window, click the Folder Action receives files and folders added to pop-up menu, select Other, and navigate to the Downloads folder inside your user folder. Click Choose. Select the Files & Folders library and drag these actions, in order, into the workflow area: Filter Finder Items, Move Finder Items, Get Specified Finder Items, Get Folder Contents, Filter Finder Items, and Move Finder Items.\nIn the first action (the first instance of the Filter Finder Items action), leave the first pop-up set to All. Then, configure the next row of pop-up menus to read File Extension is dmg.\nIn the second action, Move Finder Items, drag the Disk Images folder onto the To: Desktop pop-up menu.\nIn the third action, Get Specified Finder Items, click the Add button and navigate, once again, to the Downloads folder. Click Add. Click this action’s Options button and enable the Ignore this action’s input option.\nLeave the Get Folder Contents action alone.\nIn the next Filter Finder Items action, leave the first pop-up set to All and then configure the row of pop-up menus to read Kind is Image. Finally, in the last action (Move Finder Items) drag the My Pictures folder on top of this action’s To: pop-up menu. Save your workflow and give it a name.\n\n\nA: Also not an extention, but a separate program that goes into your control panel....    Hazel by Noodlesoft is great for this and many other uses.   Not associated with them but the demo version allows one folder to monitor I think.    Will be plenty good for your use case.\n\nA: Automator if your friend, you can create a Folder Action and attach it to Downloads folder. There are Finder's action; Filter Finder Items which can help you filter items based on extensions, names, size etc. This way you can decide what happens to type of document. Other actions like Move, Copy, Rename etc would help you do what you need.\nI would use the Run Shell Script action in Automator, you'd have more control, less chances of breaking, and probably faster. You can find the Folder Action Setup app in /System/Library/CoreServices/.\n", "Q: mac Book air shows abttery loaded 99 % but still needs to plug the chager hello Iread so many things. it seems no one faced my situation. \nmy mac book air battery is loaded at 99 % but if I disconnect the charger mac book closes\nbefore that, it often happened that randomely mac book air closes and to restart again i need to plug with charger. when I check battery it was loaded generally around 50 % \nwho can help me ?\nthank you  \n\nA: This is typical when a lithium battery fails. You could buy a new battery or take it in for service in the unlikely instance that the charging circuitry is what has broken. Batteries are designed to fail and are consumable. The circuitry is far less likely to fail, but you can't tell the difference without servicing the hardware.\nYou can learn more at http://www.apple.com/batteries/ and perhaps see what your full charge cycle and other batter information show - that would perhaps reinforce the notion that it's time to get a battery replacement.\n\nThe System Information app can show your your power measurements.\n", "Q: Softlink /bin/bash to a brew-installed bash It is a question related to this other one, but I can't comment.\nI've updated to use bash 4 from brew installation. But I don't know if changing all the header scripts from:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nTo\n#!/usr/local/bin/bash\n\nIsn't a portable solution.\nMoreover, some scripts check if the shell is a /bin/bash shell (docker-toolbox in example)\nBefore writing, I was recommended to read this: https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/119179/77314\nBut the path solution is neither portable nor can apply on docker case (no direct source). \nSo I still doubt: is really a bad idea to softlink the bash?\nObviously, targeting independent-version.\n\nA: #!/usr/bin/env bash is the 'most portable' approach but #!/bin/bash is the standard convention on OS X and Linux. There are advantages to shebang with a stable system interpreter, and it's probably not worth using a newer Bash.\n\nA: Create your own bash symbolic link. Then use that in your script. You can then change the symlink to point to whatever you want. That's the approach used with java-alternatives and other platforms (ruby, python, etc.). Thus, they change the symlinks, and you have a new version in your environment. \n", "Q: Display's native resolution not registering properly I've got an HP monitor (specs here) that is supposed to display natively in 1080p.  I've used it for years in this setup no problem.\nLast night I upgraded my Mini to a newer model, and when it was starting up I realized that I didn't have the HP monitor plugged in, just the secondary monitor, so I connected it via the HDMI port, as I always have.\nFor some reason, the HP monitor is now thinking that the edges of 1080p are an inch off the screen in every direction when told to use its native resolution in the Displays control panel.  If I use the other options below it (1080p, 720p, and 1600x900), it just gets increasingly worse, only showing a quarter of the actual screen.  Restarting has not fixed this.\nToday I was plugging it back into the old Mini to help get it set up for a coworker and it's working normally again.\nI'm completely at a loss at this point for why it's misbehaving.  The only way to get it to display at the proper size is to slide Underscan slider halfway across in the display's settings, but that causes other issues due to irregular pixel sizes, etc.\nIs there any way to \"unregister\" this monitor's settings and have it detect them again, perhaps?  Or some other way to get it to detect it properly?\n\nA: Tried doing an SMC reset, followed by a PRAM reset; neither worked.  Tried switching ports on the mini using an HDMI-Mini DVI dongle and starting up as the only connected monitor on this new setup; no change.\nIn the end what did work was switching to the monitor's DVI port and using a DVI-HDMI cable that came with a new monitor I'd picked up recently.  Screen now registers at the appropriate size and without scaling.\n\nA: I've used an HDMI screen as a monitor for my Mac Mini for years. I can tell you that in my experience, you sometimes need to enable overscan to get the display to go edge to edge. Otherwise, you get black bars around the edge of the screen. \n", "Q: Magsafe charger behaving strange I have a Macbook Pro 15 late 2011. \nThe charger has started to act funky the last few days.\nWhat happens is that I connect it. Light shows as green on the connector and then switches to orange if it needs to be charged. \nThen after a few hours the computer just dies while the light on the charger is green.

Now it works as Esc key and it's functional.\nNow I want to make the Esc key work as Caps Lock.\nIn Karabiner in ‘Change Escape Key’ section I've checked ‘Escape to CapsLock’ checkbox. However it works in completely the wrong way. By pressing Esc button it changes capitalisation, but as well as by pressing Shift+Esc buttons. Also in that mode the Caps Lock button works as a usual button by changing capitalisation.\nBut if I change it to ‘Shift-Escape to CapsLock’ box then everything works except for one thing, I have to press Shift+Esc to change capitalisation. \nSo it's not actually a swap between the Esc and Caps Lock buttons.   \nAm I missing something? How do I fix this problem?\n\nA: The problem is that you are setting up a recursive key binding.\n\n\n*\n\n*Seil changes caps lock -> esc\n\n*Karabiner changes esc -> caps lock\nSo in the end when you hit caps lock or esc you will still get caps lock.\ncaps lock -> esc -> caps lock\n\nWhen using Seil and Karbiner together you must follow the Input Even Modification Chain to determine the key press outcome (see Example 2 and Plural settings in Karabiner from the link).  You have to pay attention to the input event order.\n\n\n*\n\n*Seil propagates to...\n\n*System Preferences > Keyboard > Modifier Keys... which propagates to...\n\n*Karabine\nIn other words, you CAN’T swap just two keys with the Seil & Karabin method you are trying. It will always create a caps lock key press recursion issue.\nRather, you should try to remap both keys with Karbiner only to create a private XML mapping file. This is because Karabiner by itself does not allow you to create recursive event modifications.\nI hope this makes logical sense and helps.\n\nA: I was having a similar problem and I fixed it by changing both settings in Seil itself, as Karbine can't modify the caps-lock key and says to do it from Seil for modifying it.\n\n\n", "Q: iPhone 4 unable to connect to any Google service on Wi-Fi Today I found my iPhone 4 (iOS 7.1.2) is unable to connect specifically to any Google service (Search, Google.com or YouTube) when on Wi-Fi. \nAny other website will load.\nI get the message \"Safari cannot open the page because it could not create a secure connection to the server\".\nAll other browsers show a similar error - Google Chrome says: ERR_CONNECTION_CLOSED.\nAll my other devices on the Wi-Fi network work with Google ... my Win8 PC, my Android Tablet and Smart TV.\nI have tried resetting network settings but with no luck.\nAnyone else had this problem?\n\nA: It might be related to the DNS on the iPhone.\nGo to Settings -> Wi-Fi -> And Connect to your home Wi-Fi Network\nNow:\n\n\n*\n\n*Touch on the \"i\" icon on the right;\n\n*Where it says DNS edit the value for: 8.8.4.4\n\n*Go Back to the Wi-Fi networks listing and wait to confirm that the blue tick appears on the left.\n\n\nThis DNS address is from Google, so it will work with everything Google related but also outside of Google universe. \nI've set that address for all my DNS addresses in every machine I use and never had a problem.\n\nA: Same appeared here for me in Sydney, Australia, less than 20h ago.\nFour cases:\n1) Safari on Two iOS7 devices, iphone 4S and iPad 3, can't load Google pages (\" ... can't create secure connection ...\") when connected to my home WiFi.\nAll other sites (non-Google) that I tried load ok over the same WiFi.\n2) iPhone was then switched to 3G (cell network) and Safari loads Google stuff, no problem.\n3) two other devices, iPhone5 and iPad4, both on iOS8, load Google stuff OK over the same WiFi.\n4) iPod Touch 2ndG iOS4 - Safari loads Google OK over same WiFi.\nAll devices have DNS set same way and nothing was changed on those devices in that respect for long time nor iOS has been updated for quite some time.\nAnd tried just now, 20h later, iOS7 devices load Google stuff OK! haven't done any changes on my devices nor WiFi.\nCan't explained what happened.

However, when I played it over from QuickTime, the sound was gone. How do I make it that QuickTime also records the sound?\n\nA: To add external audio sources, you need to make sure the correct input is assigned before you start the recording \n\nTo record \"in-computer\" sound, you need software that can re-route audio within the Mac itself - to make it think an output is actually an input.\nThis has been traditionally done using a freeware app called Soundflower - originally by Cycling 74, taken over by Rogue Amoeba but not developed or supported further. Rogue Amoeba have always had their own system for intercepting Mac audio & routing it to chosen destinations, but their app, Audio Hijack, is not free ($50)\nIt is extremely good, but comes at a price.\nQuick tutorial on Soundflower in Quicktime from CNet \n\nWhen a situation arises where you want to record the audio along with your screen recoding on your Mac, you could try raising the volume on your speakers and hope that a built-in microphone captures that audio, but that's far from elegant.\nInstead, you can use Soundflower. It is a free piece of software for Mac OS X by Cycling74 that will let you route system audio within your Mac. Download and install the utility; Soundflower requires you reboot your system after installation for it to work.\nAfter your machine reboots, open QuickTime Player and start a new screen recording. In the QuickTime Player window, click the down arrow to the right of the record button and select \"Soundflower (2ch)\" as your input. Then launch System Preferences and go to the Sound settings. Go to the Output tab and select the same \"Soundflower (2ch)\" option as you did in QuickTime Player.\nWhat this does is route all of your system audio out to Soundflower as if the utility were speakers or headphones. That means any sound made by your Mac (including Facebook notifications or similar) will be recorded by QuickTime Player.\nNow you can hit record in QuickTime Player and you'll capture both the video and audio in one recording. While this is going on, you won't be able to hear the audio to monitor what's being recorded. When you're done, change your output audio back to your original settings in System Preferences.\n\n", "Q: Is eBay app update bypassing Apple's app store screening? On iPad, the ebay app keeps popping up a screen asking me to update.  No updates have shown available in the app store for a long time.   Is this a way to get around Apple's vetting process and give me undocumented \"features\" that Apple won't allow?  Apparently, not, but why/how does IOS not show that an update is available?\niPad IOS is generally updated within a day or two of new release.  Currently at IOS 9.0.1, with update screen showing up-to-date.\nHave never done a jail-break.\nApp Store \"purchased\" screen says version 3.6.0 for eBay.  App store update screen does not offer an update for ebay.  App store description (from search) shows version 4.0 available for download.  But IOS notifications do not show update available.\neBay app on launch always says \"The new app is here\" with an \"update now\" button in a large pop-up titled \"Message from eBay\"\n\nA: Current version of the eBay app is 4.0 - requires iOS 7.0 or higher.\nUnless your iPad is Jailbroken, all apps come from the iTunes app store.\nIf iTunes isn't offering the update, maybe either your iTunes or iOS is out of date?\n\nA: App store showed 4.0 as download cloud.  Normally this means I had already downloaded it once.  Before getting a free app, it normally has a \"GET\" button.\nBut when I downloaded it, it is a separate app.  The older version is still there.\nSo apparently the reason it doesn't show as an update is that they put it in the store as a separate app (instead of an update).  \nBut then why would it show that I had already \"purchased\" it?\n\nA: I had this problem as well. \nIt seems as has been mentioned  latest version of the app downloads as a seperate version. Giving you two versions. If you are getting the message pop up it means you have opened the old version. The latest version doesn't have the pop up message.\n", "Q: How to diagnose a crash from system logs?

I dutifully backed up my iPhone 5 to iTunes, as you can see here in the list of backups:\n\n(\"Mattress\" is the name of my iPhone.)\nGreat. So I set up my iPhone 6S as a new phone, so I could update the software to match what is installed on the 5. And then I went to restore the backup from today, and:\n\nWhere's my backup from today? Why can't I restore it to my new phone?\nA clue: July 10th, the date of the backup I can see, is the day I installed the iOS 9 beta on the old phone. Registering the 6S for the beta program hasn't solved it, and neither has deregistering the 5 and creating a new backup.\n\nA: I'm going to assume your iPhone 5 is running the latest beta, which is iOS 9.1. This is newer version than iOS 9.0.1--the latest non-beta release, and the version your iPhone 6s is running, according to your screenshot.\nA backup can only be restored onto a phone running the same, or a newer, version of iOS.\nSo, if my initial assumption is correct, you'd need to pick one of these options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Restore from your July 10th backup--it's clear you'd prefer\nnot to do this.\n\n*Downgrade your iPhone 5 to iOS 9.0.1, and then create a new backup which\nshould then be restorable. (Is this even possible? Perhaps by restoring\nyour iPhone 5 from it's July 10th backup... which is no better than\nabove.)\n\n*Wait until iOS 9.1 is officially released, and then restore from this\nbackup after you have upgraded your iPhone 6s to that new version (who\nwants to wait that long?).\n\n*Upgrade your shiny new iPhone 6s to the current 9.1 beta release and\nthen restore from the current, missing, backup, which will hopefully\nbecome available as the iOS version numbers will now be compatible.\n\nA: Since you have your iPhone 5 with data intact I would do the following things:\n\n\n*\n\n*Verify the iPhone 6s is at the same or higher version of iOS than the iPhone 5. \n\n*Remove all restrictions and configuration profiles. These are typically parental controls, beta and enterprise app configuration profiles, Xcode configuration profiles.\n\n*Open the App Store and update all apps. This is most important and eliminates a bug that is known where App Slicing (a.k.a App Thinning) causes restores to fail when you restore a backup to a new device type.\n\n*Power off the phone\n\n*Power it on and double check all apps are updated (or delete offending apps that are not updating or appear hung/repeat updates).\n\n*Back up the \"up to date\" iPhone with confirmed non-sliced apps installed.\n\n\nIf that fails, I would back up the Mac and then delete all iTunes backups of all devices. A reboot of the Mac wouldn't hurt here.\nIf you can't restore from the cleaned iTunes backup, the last thing I'd try before calling support is to set up a new user account on your Mac. Sign out of your current user and try to use the new account and iTunes to make a clean backup of the iPhone 5.\nSorry I don't have a precise \"fix\" - but these are the troubleshooting steps I've done during the beta process and today to help out someone in a similar situation to you. Hopefully we don't have to \"go to the mattress\" over this dilemma.\n\nA: If you are running the Beta 9 Profile when did you most recent backup you can only restore if the profile exists on your new phone. I had an iPhone 6 and was running iOS 9.1. I upgraded recently to the iPhone 6s and it would not allow me to restore from a backup that was done on the 9.1. I had to start as a new phone then redownload the beta profile and update to 9.1. Then reset the phone to factory settings and you should be able to restore from the latest beta backup.\n", "Q: How is the tab chosen when opening a link from an external location? I have Safari open with 111 tabs open.\nI clicked on a URL that a friend sent me on Skype.\nSafari opened the link in a random tab that wasn't selected, and was neither the first or the last one on the left or right.\nThe URL that I clicked replaced this tab's content, it was not a new tab.\nHow was this random tab selected out of the 111 tabs, to be the recipient of the URL I clicked?\n\nA: It's usually not a random tab but the current active tab.

For several years, the drive has served as my primary backup.\nThen, a few months ago, it suddenly stopped mounting on my desktop. My other external USB drive, a Western Digital, continues to mount just fine.\nUnplugging the eGo Drive's power supply and plugging it back in again several times, unplugging the USB cable from both the drive and my iMac, and using a different USB port on my iMac, have not solved the problem. The eGo Drive still refuses to mount.\nFurthermore, it does not show up in the left pane of Disk Utility.\nNeither is it listed under About This Mac/System Report/Hardware/USB.\nIt likewise refuses to appear if I type \"/volumes\" under \"Go/Go to Folder...\".\nIt does not appear in the EtreCheck app either.\nFinally, if I type \"diskutil list\" in the Terminal, that doesn't work either.\nAnother suggestion I found online said to force quit the \"fsck_hfs\" process if I see it in Activity Monitor. However, I do not see it there, not even under \"All Processes\".\nWhen I turn on the eGo Drive, I can hear it spinning up, but that is as far as it goes.\nI read online that there is an application called USB Prober -- a part of Xcode -- which may possibly recognize the eGo Drive and get it to mount. However, I do not see it anywhere in my Xcode 7.0 installation, and I haven't found a link to download it from either.\nI would really like to resurrect the eGo Drive if there is still some way to do it. If not, then I face another problem: The eGo Drive is loaded with a lot of personal data, including family photos and movies, financial records, software registrations and serial numbers, and a lot more. As such, I obviously do not feel comfortable with just throwing it i the trash.\nSo, is there some easy way to totally erase the drive, even though I am unable to mount it on my desktop? I have read that strong magnetic fields can destroy data on a hard drive, and I imagine that they sell devices which perform just such a task, but I don't own one of them, and I probably couldn't afford one anyway.\nSo, if anyone can tell me how I can either get my iMac to recognize the eGo Drive so that I can at least erase it -- and maybe even reformat it if need be -- or possibly even mount it, and then reformat it, I would be very appreciative.\nThank you.\n\nA: There's still several elements you may not have checked. First, swap cables to make sure the cable is ok. If it still fails, then next, make sure your power supply really works. If possible, get a variable replacement AC/DC converter from an electronics store. Mine lets me set the voltage, amps, and ohms along with changing the connector tips. Use the settings on the original DC converter to test. \nAssuming none of those items were the issue then you still have two other elements to check: the case and its controller and the drive itself. \nTo check the case: go to your local Best Buy or other electronics store and get a hard drive case. They're very inexpensive now. Pop open the old case, take the drive out, and put it into the new case. If it mounts, the issue was the case. If it still does not mount, it's the drive.\nTo really get rid of the drive, toss the drive in a fire. Nothing will be salvageable. \n\nA: If you can take the drive to another computer or two (windows or Mac or unix) - it doesn't matter - you'll know if the drive is the problem.\nYou might need to verify the USB cable and power supply since you'd hate to scrap a drive that works if the problem is a $10 accessory or loose connection.\nIf so, you can just put a nail through the enclosure or seek warranty service and verify that the vendor will sanitize the drive magnetically.\nI wouldn't trust any device for degaussing since the operator is the one that needs to be trained. If you don't care to reuse the drive or seek warranty service, you could just open it up and remove the platters.\nAt that point, passing any magnet on the surface and the contamination / surface damage you do will render most of the data extremely expensive to recover and hamper all but the most CIA/NSA/FBI determined analyst to get meaningful data from the drive.\n", "Q: Are iOS applications required to have retina images?

I had troubles with non-apple adapters – the simply dind't worked for me...\nYou can make 2 things to diagnose the issue I can think of:\n\n\n*\n\n*boot into linux (make a usb from ubuntu with unetbootin)and check if it works in linux – if it does it's a software issue (i guess), meaning some kind of hack is necessary\n\n*check your system.log by opening the Console.app or by tailing it in terminal with tail -f /var/log/system.log, also take a look if sudo dmesg got anything useful to say. \nWhen you got the console or terminal open – just connect/disconnect the monitor and check if you get any kind of log activity from it, that should at least give you some idea if the hardware reacts on the display when Intel HDxxxx is used for graphics.\nI would first check the syslog and then check the setup in Ubuntu 15.10, grab the latest Ubuntu iso file from here: http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/daily-live/current/wily-desktop-amd64.iso\n", "Q: Use Siri To Launch App I am trying to use Siri to launch an app.  So I say \"Open Hipchat\", however Siri interprets it as \"Open Hip Chat\".   Which she then doesn't find it because the app is named \"HipChat\" and not \"Hip Chat\".\nAny way to help Siri understand that \"Hipchat\" is one word and not two?  \n\nA: Siri finds hip chat for me on my iPad and iPhone. \nThe space doesn't matter.  I wonder if some other thing is wrong with your spotlight index, or if you've run out of free space on the device. \nYou might need to troubleshoot other apps and Siri or go through some of the generic troubleshooting steps like powering off the phone, restoring phone, etc.\n", "Q: Terminal prompt 'saving' certain commands on up-arrow I added a little bit of shell scripting to my prompt for fun. It alternates the colors of prompt items randomly. I did it purely because a gray screen gets boring after awhile. The following is my prompt in .bash-profile:\nfunction next_hue\n{\n    color1=$((31 + (++color % 7)))   # set 31 to 30 for dark on light\n    color1=$((31 + (++color % 7)))\n    PS1=\"\\n\\e[0:${color}m[\\W]\\n\\e[0:${color}m[\\u]-> $reset\" # set 1 to 0 for     dark on light\n}\n\nThis alternates the color of my prompt. Yay!\nThe problem is that sometimes the shell will get \"stuck.\" For instance, the shell is usually like this:\ndirectory\n[username]->\n\nIf I have recently run the docker run command, and I up-arrow into the history, `docker run gets stuck and I end up with this:\ndirectory\n[username]->docker run\n\nIf I add a new command it stacks on docker run:\ndirectory\n[username]->docker runcd /some/path\n\nI have to use ctrl-c or some other such option, and I can't use the docker-run command again unless I type it all out. WHat could be causing this error? I have looked over my prompt quite a bit and I think it is okay, but it was confusing to figure out in the first place.\n\nA: You're not escaping the non-printing characters in your prompt. See this article, and use \"\\[\" and \"\\]\" around the colors, something like this (untested) for example...\nPS1=\"\\n\\e[0:\\[${color}\\]m[\\W]\\n\\e[0:\\[${color}\\]m[\\u]-> $reset\"\n\nYou may need to tweek that. Like I said, this is untested so I may have inserted a \"\\]\" in the middle of a colour code. For my prompt I do the escaping when I initialise the colour variables:\nPS1_FG=\"\\[$(tput setaf 223)\\]\"  # Prompt foreground colour (223 = pale orange/brown)\n\nFor what it's worth, I can highly recommend using tput when you're dealing with control codes. It makes your scripts more portable, and (IMHO) is easier to read.\n", "Q: iPhone 4S text message annoyance I updated my iPhone 4S to iOS 9, but now \"0:00\" appears sometimes in the text message window. Am I doing something to cause that to appear?\n\nA: I have encountered this issue since the betas of 9.0 and can confirm it up to 9.0.2.\nThe reason for the appearance of this issue is that the iPhone thinks you are trying to record a message. This occurs whenever the proximity sensor thinks that you have put your phone to your ear or otherwise been fooled into thinking so.\nThis feature works fine with iMessages, but SMS obviously does not support sending voice messages. Whatever the reason, it gets triggered but the software does not know how to handle it, leaving it in the inconsistent state.\nA temporary solution is to quit the Messages app with the Multitasking switcher, or trigger a voice message in an iMessage conversation and cancel (which interestingly prevents the issue from reoccurring while the Messages app remains in memory).\nThe ultimate solution will have to come from Apple in a bug fix.\n\nA: iOS 9.0.1 is out now. It's really all bug fixes for iOS 9.0. Go to Settings > General > Software Update and update your iPhone.\nUpdate: iOS 9.0.2 is out now, so be sure to update to that.\n\nA: I had exactly the same thing happen with my messaging as well. I turned the phone fully off and back on and it seemed to have solved it.  Good luck\n", "Q: Difference between Apple's Thunderbolt ethernet adapters?

Since turning on iTunes Cloud and Apple Music, I have noticed creeping corruption in my iTunes library. There are songs which exist, but only as items which are NOT available offline, and NOT available ONLINE.  They are gray, and when I click on the cloud download icon they do not download from iCloud.\nI suspect I must use Time Machine to retrieve a copy of my iTunes library that has not been munched up by the fine engineers at Apple and turned into a worthless pile of bits.  Before I despair, and go back into backups, is there any way to repair this?\nHere is a screen-shot example:\n\n\nA: First turn iTunes Match and iTunes Cloud off. If you have not added a lot of music you can't stand adding back manually, you can just go to ~/Music/iTunes and rename one of the Previous iTunes Library files to \"iTunes Library.itl\"and move it back up to the iTunes folder, leaving out the quotes. See the screenshot of my folder; the closer the file's date is to the date of the current file, the less adding back of music you will have to do.

A friend of mine is traveling to China and he was asking if iCloud Photo Library is reliable enough in China so he can take pictures past the 16GB limit on his iPhone? I know Google is delayed or blocked in China, so Google Photos is out. What about iCloud?\n\nA: iCloud and Apple services are not blocked in China, the iPhone will be able to access iCloud Photo Library and www.icloud.com\nKeep in mind that maybe the user will be prompted to enter additional information in order to login if Two-step Verification is enabled. This can include verification code sent to the device or SMS messages to the number associated with the Apple ID.\nAs alternative to iCloud Photo Library, OneDrive from Microsoft can be used for the same purpose that offers 15GB of space (I don't know if the Upload Camera bonus for additional 15GB is still active). The service has a dedicated app for iPhone (link).\nUPDATE: On November 2015 Microsoft announced that will reduce the free space of OneDrive to 5GB and the Upload Camera bonus will also be removed. \nSECOND UPDATE: On 11 December 2015 Microsoft announced that the users can keep their 15GB storage plus the 15GB Camera bonus if they confirm using this page: https://preview.onedrive.com/bonus/\nDropbox is blocked in China and can't be used to backup your mobile phone photos.\n", "Q: Issue with Siri suddenly misunderstanding what I say Siri used to be great for voice dictation on my iPhone.

When I dictate text to my phone, sometimes to avoid having to type it, some of it is underlined with blue dots.\nIt looks real pretty, but the purpose of this is lost on me: if these words are treated differently from other words, or if the underlining means something, I have no idea what it could possibly be.\nAt first, I thought that it was because during voice dictation, the software had understood a couple of different things and that I could then chose between different options, but that's not what it seems to be.\nIf I click the words that are underlined, it doesn't give me anymore options than when I click non-underlined words.\nMaybe it's app-specific? Although it looks like it would be system-wide. The app used in this screen cap is What's App.\n\n\nA: You are actually correct as the highlighting appears for words that the system doesn't think that it fully recognized. If it can determine similar words to suggest than when you tap the segment of text, it will provide those alternates - to a remarkable degree of accuracy at times. However, if it cannot determine other possibilities, the text simply becomes highlighted when you tap it so that replacement of the erroneous word becomes very easy: just tap the word and type the correct one. \n", "Q: How to switch straight to a keyboard in mac I use 3 different language keyboards (japanese, english, chinese), all with their own special input method editors (IMEs). I have a fast switch between Japanese and English by just hitting either left or right CMD key respectively, which I set up using Karabiner. But, to get to my chinese keyboard I have to still flip through my other keyboards to find.\nI was wondering if there was any way to set up a keyboard shortcut I could use to switch directly to my Chinese keyboard. I've tried using automator, but automator always plays out the entire \"open menu\", \"select chinese keyboard\", which takes about a second to run through (slow), and moves my mouse to the other end of the screen. \nI'd be happy to use automator if somebody knows how I can remove this, or otherwise how to set up a shortcut some other way (or software to do this), I'd be grateful.\n\nA: One easy thing you can do is to setup a shortcut that cycles forward and backwards through all input sources you have on your Mac. \nSo assuming you have them setup in this order: Japanese, English, Chinese and Japanese is currently active, pressing the keyboard shortcut will move to English and if you press it again to Chinese and then back to Japanese after a third press. With the second shortcut you can cycle backwards at any time.\nAlternatively you can set an unused F-key in the top row of your keyboard (on mine F5 and F6 is free and on a full-size keyboard you have F13-F19 unused too) to be your shortcut, so pressing those will cycle through your options. \nAs far as I know there is no solution straight from OS X that will allow you to pick a specific language just by pressing an F-key. What might be an option is to setup an Apple Script inside System Preference that is being triggered by an F-key which sets your input source to a specific language. I might read into that and post it here, if the previous option doesn't meet your needs.\nHow to set it up\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to System Preferences (see Apple Logo at the top if it's not in the Dock)\n\n*Go to Keyboard\n\n*Select the tab \"Shortcuts\"\n\n*Pick \"Input Sources\" from the list on the left\n\n*Activate the shortcuts you would like to use and then click on the right to define the shortcut by pressing the desired combination or F-key.\n\n*Close System Preferences and try it out\nI hope this was helpful to you.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro showing prohibitory sign on start up MacBook Pro with Retina display, OS X Yosemite.

I screen recorded ~5hrs of video using Quicktime, split up into roughly 10-20 minute segments. The folder which I saved them to is 4.73 GB big.\n\nHowever when I string those videos together using iMovie, add about 5 titles, and attempt to export a file at best quality, it estimates 332 GB!\n\nThe next step down is a lot better, but still nearly 10x bigger at 45.4 GB.\n\nEven low quality is still more than 3x bigger than the original files\nWhere is all this extra data coming from?\nEDIT: Even weirder, my screen recordings have no audio data, and I haven't added any in, so why is it still big when exporting audio only?\n\n\nA: You have inadvertently wandered into the murky realm of video codecs.\nThe screen recording you made with Quicktime was initially saved using the extremely efficient H.264 compression algorithm.\nH.264 is a codec optimised for distribution of video. It is designed to store video using the least possible amount of data at the cost of using a lot of CPU time to encode or decode.\nIf you have ~5hrs of video in 4.73GB of data, that must be encoded at ~2.1Mbit per second. This is extremely efficient compression! (for comparison, standard definition DVDs rarely pack more than 4hrs of video onto 7GB of space).\nThis efficiency is due to h.264 and that, unlike regular video footage, in screen recordings not much is typically changing between frames.\niMovie is optimised for working with video, not screen recordings, so the output options are tuned with that in mind.\n\n\n*\n\n*ProRes, is a close-to-uncompressed algorithm that is optimised for editing video (computationally light to decompress and scrub through at the cost of lots of disk space).\n\n*High, will be a H.264 compression at approx 20Mbit/sec, this is a reasonable data rate for compressing HD video with good quality.\nThe audio option. AIFF is an uncompressed audio format. Thus it will use the same amount of data regardless of the content; even if your screen recording has no sound, it's still going to save 5hrs * 44.1 thousand zeros.\n", "Q: Switching between Chrome Developer Tools and main window full screen I'm running OS X 10.5.5 Yosemite.

I have a maxed out MacBook Pro (end of 2013, 1TB SSD, Quad Core Haswell) and collect a lot of ripped mp3 files from viny, move them around in a folder structure. The problem is that Finder is incredibly slow and laggy, dragging files from one folder to another seems almost broken. I also noticed the same stuttering when scrolling through my apps folder.\nIs it normal for Finder to react so slow, when many files are in a folder or might this be a hardware problem? I'm on 10.9.5 and can't upgrade at the moment.\n\nA: Bulk file & folder moves/copies using the Finder are more easily accomplished at the command line in Terminal. A benefit is that the process executes faster.\nThe mv and cp commands are what you need. Use wildcard file selection on the source side of the command, and create target paths from dragging the associated Finder icons into the Terminal window. Take a look at the myriad options available at man mv and man cp.\n\nA: As IconDaemon said, terminal is better but selecting files from the origin and then using CMD+ C  and ALT +CMD +V at the destination can cut paste in a less troubling manner than dragging and dropping.\n", "Q: How to remove duplicate songs from itunes playlist? How to remove duplicate titles from itunes playlist ?\nWhen adding directories with mp3s to itunes that contains playlist files, it's listing twice (or more) the songs in the album view.\n\nA: After selecting the playlist you would like remove duplicates from in iTunes, you'll then want to select \"Name\" in the \"Sort By\" menu (located under the \"View\" main menu item). \n\nThis will sort the songs in alphabetical order to where you can easily identify any duplicates since they'll appear right next to each other. \nYou'll then want to select a duplicated song and hover over the selected song to reveal the ...

On some of these sites it is possible to select which cam you want to use if you have more then just one connected. But on some other sites you can't select which cam you will use. If you visit those sites with an iMac you always get the built-in iSight cam turned on.

I have reset PRAM and the sound volume output improves, but only for a short time.  Settings all appear to be set properly.  I'm thinking there's a hardware problem.  This is why:  I have a monitor that I connect to my Macbook with an HDMI cable.  The monitor has a headphone jack.  If I plug my headphones into the monitor's headphone jack the sound output is great.  Any thoughts?  Thank you.\n\nA: Could definitely be hardware related. Try testing out the headphone audio in a new \"test\" user account. If it continues, its most likely hardware.

When I try to do a calculation that needs to allocate and use 128 GB of memory (it is a command line program written in C), the kernel kills my process with extreme prejudice.  This console log entry is an example of one instance:\n\n9/25/15 7:08:40.000 PM kernel[0]: low swap: killing pid 6202 (huffgrp)\n\nThe calculation works fine and in a reasonable amount of time when it allocates and uses 64 GB of memory.  My machine has 32 GB of RAM and beaucoup space on the hard drive.  I also tried this on another machine with 8 GB of RAM, on which the 64 GB calculation runs fine as well, taking longer of course, but the 128 GB calculation gets killed by the kernel in the same way.  On both I am running Yosemite 10.10.5.\nBy the way, malloc() never returns an error, no matter how much space I ask for.  The kernel will only kill the process once too much of that memory is actually being used by the process, resulting in lots of swapping to the hard drive.\nSo there appears to be a secret swap space limit somewhere between 64 GB and 128 GB.\nMy question is: how do I reconfigure the kernel to permit more swap space?  I found a promising looking file, /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.dynamic_pager.plist, but I don't see the secret number in there.  The man page for dynamic_pager says that all it does is set the name and location of the swap files. There is an older version of the same man page that documents a -S option to set the size of the swapfiles created. I tried that, requesting 160 GB swapfiles, but it had no effect. The swapfiles were still 1 GB each, and the process was still killed by the kernel.\n\nA: While I could not find any more recent documentation, Singh's \"Mac OS X Internals: A Systems Approach\" mentions two obscure limits in /sbin/dynamic_pager (p. 919 f.):\n\n  \n*\n  \n*The absolute minimum and maximum swap file sizes are 64MB and 1GB, respectively.\n  \n*The maximum swap file size must not be greater than 12.5% of the free space available on the volume that contains the swap file. Moreover, the maximum swap file size must not be greater than the amount of physical memory on the system.\n  \n*At most, eight swap files can be created.\n[...]\n\nWhile the book is a bit dated and the numbers are likely to have changed, the 12.5% rule sounds very suspicious to me. \nSingh implies that those are hard-coded limits in the binary and thus the property file you found is likely not to be of use. Also note that the swap system creates several, but only up to eight, distinct swap files.\n/sbin/dynamic_pager is documented, as you noted, as a very rudimentary man page, and there is a conflicting statement in the current developer documentation on Virtual Memory, stating that\n\nTo give processes access to their entire 4 gigabyte or 18 exabyte address space, OS X uses the hard disk to hold data that is not currently in use. As memory gets full, sections of memory that are not being used are written to disk to make room for data that is needed now. The portion of the disk that stores the unused data is known as the backing store because it provides the backup storage for main memory.\n[...]\nNote: Unlike most UNIX-based operating systems, OS X does not use a preallocated disk partition for the backing store. Instead, it uses all of the available space on the machine’s boot partition.\n\n(emphasis mine)\nHence, at around this point, I'd go for some pragmatic workaround. Perhaps try increasing your disk space even further to check for a correlation in the obtainable swap size, thus checking the 12.5% limitation mentioned above.\n", "Q: How to quickly delete multiple albums in Photos app (OS X) My Photos app (on OS X) has very many (well over a hundred) albums sitting inside an iPhoto Events folder. Most of the albums have are named by a day, e.g. '16 May 2014'. In order to delete an album I need to right click, select delete album and then say YES, when I'm asked when I'm sure. To clean up all these old (and unwanted) albums is taking ages.\nIs there a quicker way of deleting albums? The keyboard shortcut mentioned in this Ask Different question (hitting delete with the album selected) does not work for me. I can only do the right click thing. Adding a keyboard shortcut with the contextual (right click) menu didn't work either. I can't select multiple albums at once and delete them all either.\nAm I missing a trick, or is the app just designed to make deleting albums a one at a time and confirm every time thing?\nUpdate\nSome more experimentation and, in line with @dankohn below, it is possible to do this. Things to note:\n\n*\n\n*You can't select multiple albums in the Sidebar. So if you want to select multiple albums to delete you need to do it in the main window. This confused me - so maybe it will have confused others too.\n\n\n*Selecting Album view (or using ⌘ 3) does not necessarily take you into a view of Albums. If you've previously been looking inside an album, selecting this view changes the main window to show the photos inside that album, i.e. you don't get to see the list of albums at all. If this happens, you need use the back button (top left) to go back to the listing of Albums. This confused me - so maybe it will have confused others too.\nOnce you have got a list of albums showing the main window, as @dankohn, you can select multiple albums (using Shift Click or ⌘ Click) and then you can delete them using a Right Click / the contextual menu.\nNote: All this applies to Photos 1.0.1 running on Yosemite. Things may have changed with El Capitan.\n\nA: Select View: Albums. Click the first album, than shift click the last album. Then right-click any of the selected albums and select Delete, to delete them all.\n\nA: FINALLY IT WORKED!\nThis finally worked with your suggestion of Not using the sidebar but clicking at the top of it where it says'albums'. They then all show up on a screen and you can delete just like you delete on regular photos.\n", "Q: OS X management profiles / root certificate My father asked me to sort out some things on his MacBook. He's recently left his company where he used his laptop on the company servers/IT system whilst he was there. At some point in the past he got some tech support from the company IT department and they might have set up some software on his laptop.\nWhilst in the App Store application I tried to install some updates but it failed to connect with a message something like \"could not contact the app store server at apple.<company-domain>.com\".\nI thought this was strange that the App Store thought the update server was one at the company domain so I had a look around the Mac settings.\nIn settings I found a \"profiles\" section and inside there were some items which appeared to be some sort of trusted root certificate issued by <company name> and something that said it enabled remote management of the laptop by .\nIt also may have had a configuration profile with something like \"Mobile Device Management\", although I can't recall exactly.\nI promptly deleted them all and the app store then worked as normal.\nCan anyone explain what these items were and what security implications could there have been? Could <company name> have performed man-in-the-middle attacks on my father's web traffic? Would deleting these items such that the \"Profile\" section of Settings is no longer visible protect from any access or control from the company's IT department?\nThis may be more appropriate for security.stackexchange.com but I'd just like to understand if any privacy may have been breached.\nEdit\nThis is the kind of item present, although this is not the actual one but a screenshot I found:\n\n\nA: MDM (Mobile Device Management) profiles can change many settings within the system. As you suspected, in this case the software update mechanism was redirected to a company server. There were likely other settings as well. If the profile forced all network traffic through a VPN, then the company could view it in transit. You can check by looking in the network preferences for interfaces labeled \"VPN\" in the interface list. \nSince you deleted the profile, you should be ok. Check the network settings, and also look for applications that may have been installed by the profile in /Applications. One other thing to look for, would be CA certificates installed into either the System Roots or the System Keychain. Use Keychain Access and search in the System Roots for anything including the name of the company. Do the same for the System Keychain.\n", "Q: iPhone mail using 700Mb with no accounts While trying to clear up space on my iPhone, I deleted all email accounts, as Mail was using well over 700Mb.

There is currently no easy way to remove them, however, you can send feedback to Apple here, and tell them you want a way to delete app cache.\nYou can restore from iTunes to remove it, as it's not backed up.

When I would restart, there were no open apps. However, now when I force quit every app and restart, they are all open again. Even if I close out of everything and maybe have Twitter open and a game, when I restart, I have a ton of apps open when I only had two before restarting. Does anyone know what is going on?\n\nA: The list of apps shown after double clicking the home button is not only the list of open apps but also the list of apps most recently used. Or in other words: not all apps in the list are actually \"open\" (whatever this means on iOS anyway).\n\nA: As long thought & finally confirmed once & for all by Apple's Senior vice-president, Craig Federighi, this week - it serves no purpose whatsoever to quit backgrounded apps.\nSource :  BBC News -\nApple customer goes to the top for iPhone battery answer\n\n\nThe head of Apple's operating system iOS confirmed that open but\nunused apps do not affect iPhone battery life after a customer emailed\nboss Tim Cook. The customer from Ohio, known as Caleb, asked Mr Cook\nwhether closing down \"multitasking apps\" improved battery life and\nwhether it was something the chief executive did himself.\nSenior vice-president Craig Federighi replied \"no and no\".\nHowever, other smartphone batteries can benefit from app closure.\nMicrosoft advises Nokia Lumia owners to close apps that aren't in use\non a web page about extending battery life.\nAndroid creator Google suggests identifying and closing apps that are\nnot often in use but warns that frequent use of its Overview\ndevice manager to do this will in itself drain the battery.\n\"You can view and optimise your device through closing running apps\nand uninstalling unnecessary apps,\" said Samsung in an announcement\nabout a new \"smart manager\" app for the Galaxy 6.\nWhile many Apple users do shut down apps in the belief it extends the\niPhone battery this is not advice explicitly given by the firm itself.\nIt only recommends disabling apps from carrying out background\nrefreshes in a list of tips about saving power.\n\n\nA: I've been struggling with this very big on both iPhone 6 Plus and iPhone 6s Plus after upgrading to iOS 9. \nI finally figured out how to solve this problem without whiling the device and 'setting up as new.'\nSolution: 'Reset All Settings'\nThat's it. Good as new. No content or media erased (differs from 'Erase All Content'), just retyping a few passwords for iCloud, wifi and recustomizing your ringtones and notification settings. \nWas dreading having to wipe my device and Setup As New...\n\nA: Here is how I solved it.\nHopefully it'll work for you.\n\n\n*\n\n*Double click home button.\n\n*Swipe up to close all apps.\n\n*Open a single app.\n\n*Now double click  home button but do not swipe up.\n\n*Press the power button. But do not swipe to power off.\n\n*Press and hold the home button till you're back at the desktop.\n\n*Double click home button again.\n\n*Press the power button again.\n\n*This time swipe it off.\n\n*Turn it back on.\n\n\nAfter signing in, you should only have one app opened instead of 32 which is what I had ever when I rebooted. \n", "Q: Apple Watch Apps Not Available for Download Sometimes, certain apps don't show up in the main menu of the Apple Watch app, in the section where all downloadable apps currently installed on iPhone are displayed. They also disappear from my Apple Watch at those moments. I do have them installed on my iPhone, so I'm not sure what the issue is.\nI have an iPhone 6+ running iOS 9.0.1, and an Apple Watch running watchOS 1.0.1.\nHow do I get the apps to appear? I've so far tried uninstalling and reinstalling the apps on my iPhone from the Apps tab of the Apple Watch app, and restarting both my phone and watch.\n\nA: Could be a bug. Try updating to watchOS 2 and see if that helps.\n", "Q: Where can I download a full OS X 10.11.1 Public Beta installer? I have a bootable OS X drive that I like to keep up to date, but with the replacement of \"Install OS X El Capitan Public Beta\" with \"Install OS X El Capitan GM Candidate\" in the App Store, I'm not sure where I can get the latest beta of 10.11.1. Does the app named GM Candidate now contain 10.11.1, or does 10.11.1 just not exist in fully-downloadable form?\n\nA: I believe, unless you have a paid developer account, the only way to get it is to download thru the app store.\nI installed the GM version and the .1 update was offered to me as well. So you should get the GM and then the .1 update too.\n", "Q: Apple Photos Shared Albums on OS X are not updating I created a new shared album on one computer. I can see that album on my iOS devices, but not on my other computer (all of them are on the same iCloud account). Quitting and restarting Apple Photos doesn't help. How do I get Apple Photos to see the updates?\n\nA: Quit Apple Photos. Now run Activity Monitor, look for Photos Agent, and kill it by selecting and clicking the X at the top left.\n\nNow, start Apple Photos again. This will restart Photos Agent, and after a minute, you should see your updated shared albums.\n", "Q: Can I use iTunes credit to help subsidise buy hardware in Apple online store? I am thinking about buying an iPad Pro or MacBook Air (Skylake), as a first time buyer of Apple hardware.\nI was wondering if I can use iTunes credit balance to help subsidise/buy this hardware in Apple Online store?\n\nA: Unfortunately, no. One can only use iTunes credit to buy iTunes Store content and apps, not hardware. I think that it says that on the card itself in fine print, but I could be wrong.\nI couldn't find an official statement from Apple, but here's something from the Apple support community: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/2592711?start=0&tstart=0\n", "Q: Android phone not even charging on a Mac Mini (Yosemite) I'm new to OSX, so I'm probably doing something which is obviously wrong.\nI have a Samsung Note and USB cable which when plugged into my Linux laptop work without any issues.\nI have a late-2012 Mac Mini running Yosemite.\nWhen I plug the phone into the Mac Mini's USB ports it does not even start charging.  I have tried three different USB ports, including ports I know are working (as I swapped the keyboard and mouse plugs).\nWhat do I need to do for my Mac Mini to at least charge my Android Phone?\n\nA: I have zero experience with Android, that said it may be that a driver or such (sync software for Mac?) might be needed for the Mac to 'recognize' the phone\n\nA: The solution was to buy a Cubot X15 Android phone to replace the 3+ year old Samsung Note.  It worked with the Mac Mini immediately. \n", "Q: iCloud Notes not syncing I have been using the Notes app to take notes on my iPhone 5s for years now but recently I'd like to make those notes accessible on my iMac and Nexus 7  Tablet.\nTo sync them to the cloud I added Notes syncing on my phone and moved all my local notes over the iCloud account. Everything appears to work and if I login to my iCloud account through the web browser the notes appear online. But the notes will not sync to the Notes app on either my iMac or Nexus 7 (running the Notepad app).\nI have attempted enabling/disabling the Notes app on iMac and Notepad app on the Nexus 7. Closing/opening the app. Restarting the both devices. Nothing seems to work.\nIs there some workaround for this I'm missing or is iCloud Notes sync somehow broken.\nI'm running the latest OSX (10.10.5) and lates IOS (9.0.1).\nAside: I've attempted to use Google Notes sync as an alternative but the OSX version of Notes doesn't play nice with Google's 2-factor auth.\nUpdate: I have a note that was created before the update that did successfully sync to my iMac and Nexus 7 prior to updating Notes on my iPhone. As a test I just made a change to it on the Nexus 7 and it successfully synced the note on my iMac but didn't update the note on my iPhone.\nIt looks like the iPhone is successfully using the latest version that links with my iCloud account but my iMac and Nexus 7 are working with an old version that doesn't reflect on my iCloud account. WTF.\n\nA: Updating OSX to El Capitan resolved the issue.\nUpdate:\nJust to clarify. The issue started when I updated my iPhone to the latest version (ie IOS9). A notification popped up saying my iMac's would also need to be updated to IOS9 to remain compatible which is likely a bug as my iMac doesn't run IOS (Ie should have said OSX 10.11 El Capitan).\nAt the time I wrote this question I wasn't aware that OSX had just released a new version.\nFrom what I can tell, Notes.app has received a big overhaul in the latest IOS/OSX. Looks like they're on the warpath to kill and replace Evernote. Either way, the new features aren't available in older versions.\nLooks like their syncing strategy is to continue syncing the old version of notes between devices but (eventually) cut iCloud.com support.\n\nA: My advice is to sign out of your iCloud account on your iPhone and iMac (or at least go to System Preferences on the Mac and turn off Notes). Then, since everything is on the iCloud.com version of Notes, remove the notes from your computer and phone.  When that is done, sign back in or reactivate Notes and they should all be in sync.\nI've never dealt with the Nexus personally or professionally, but I would probably say to delete and re-download the app you're using to sync it up correctly.\n", "Q: Are there any deep details on the specifics of what the “Low Power Mode” in iOS 9 actually affects? So as mentioned in this canonical question and answer thread on iOS 9 features, “Low Power Mode” is a good thing. This is what iOS 9’s blurb on “Low Power Mode” explains it does when activated:\n\nLow Power Mode temporarily reduces power consumption until you can\n  fully charge your iPhone. When this is on, mail fetch, background app\n  refresh, automatic downloads and some visual effects are reduced or\n  turned off.\n\nOkay, I get the gist of this. I understand the broad concepts. But is this really all that happens in “Low Power Mode?” For example, what are the exact visual effects which are “reduced or turned off?” Are there any more specific details from Apple on exactly what “Low Power Mode” does?\n\nA: Apple hasn't really discussed specifically what Low Power Mode actually does. Its main underdocumented feature is that it underclocks the processor, reducing performance to increase battery life, but there's a few other tweaks it makes to the system as noted underneath the switch.\nAs shown in these screenshots, Low Power Mode reduces the performance by ~30%.\n\n\n\nSource: http://www.macrumors.com/2015/06/25/ios-9-low-power-mode-benchmarks/\nApple lists the following as features modified by Low Power Mode:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Email fetch\n  \n*Hey Siri\n  \n*Background app refresh\n  \n*Automatic downloads\n  \n*Wi-Fi associations\n  \n*Some visual effects\n  \n\nSource: https://support.apple.com/kb/HT205234\nMore details are provided in the developer documentation (Energy Efficiency Guide for iOS Apps):\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Reduce CPU and GPU performance\n  \n*Pause discretionary and background activities, including networking\n  \n*Reduce screen brightness\n  \n*Reduce the timeout for auto-locking the device\n  \n*Disable Mail fetch\n  \n*Disable motion effects\n  \n*Disable animated wallpapers\n  \n\nSource: https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/Performance/Conceptual/EnergyGuide-iOS/LowPowerMode.html\nApple encourages developers to take advantage of this feature by implementing a lower power state in their apps. This means that this feature may increase battery life through support in third-party apps.\n\nYour app should take additional steps to help the system save energy when Low Power Mode is active. For example, your app could reduce the use of animations, lower frame rates, stop location updates, disable syncs and backups, and so on.\n\n", "Q: Keep command output in terminal screen I'm new to Mac, when I use terminal, I found some commands like git log behaviours different from Linux.\nOn Linux, they will print result on screen and exit, leave all result on screen and I can see it when I input another command.

Screen after running command looks like this:\n$ git log\n$ \n\nResult has been cleared form screen.\nCan I change some settings to make it behaviours like linux? Thanks.\n\nA: The output of git log is sent to a pager for display, which can be configured via git config (variable name is core.pager). By default, less is used, so you may want to compare the value of $LESS on both systems.\n", "Q: What is \"private browsing\" used for? What is it when you are in \"private\" from the home screen?

That would be a great first step in figuring out if there is a problem with the hardware. If it is not your keyboard, then I would try to turn of your Mac and turn it back on.

So I wanted to jailbreak my iPhone and I was interested in it before but I never really took the time to. Research properly. Forgetting that I might jailbreak in the future, I updated my phone to iOS 9. I didn't really like iOS 9 and the fact that you can run a jailbreak on it.\nI researched a little and found out that I can restore with an IPSW file and I was stoked. However, it seems that Apple only “signs” down to ios 8.4.1, an UN-jailbreak able version of iOS.\nWhat does it mean if an IPSW file is not signed? And what would happen if I were to put an unsigned version of iOS on my phone?\nI got the IPSW file from this website. I have tried researching pretty much everywhere but I cannot find an answer. \n\nA: Easily spoken, you could say ipsw files are not complete.  They're missing that so-called signature.  It's like a contract; it has no value without the signature.  Every time you install new firmware on the iPhone, iTunes calls to the Apple servers and ask for that approval signature.  For numerous reasons, Apple doesn't give out those signatures for older firmware versions.\nThere's not much you can do.  The only thing you can do is downgrading to 8.4.1 and hope one day somebody releases the jailbreak for it.  But for now, you're stucked.\nUPDATE: As of Oct 2015 Apple stopped signing 8.x.  As of Oct 2016 Apple stopped signing 9.x.  While this answer is not correct any more it still describes the general idea behind Apple firmware signing.\n\nA: You can obtain a signature which developer ID, and Date Signed. if you know what the orignal checkSum is it is easily modified using notepad and fiddler 4. For file signatures, push a Untampered IOS Update through 3utools, Flashing with proFlash. Before starting the process, have fiddler 4 open and then start the flashing. during the process fiddler will recieve a response for the ios update md5 checksum from its servers, and the file signature files later on. Once complet to find the signature go into the 3uTools system files, and inside the Other folder you will find  a zip file call ss_ios.zip . Inside that zip you will find a .sig file. that is the file you must use to sign your modded files. Also If the Last Modified Date doesnt match the original file, you will also fail. Though changing the metadata on the last modified date is easy. \nAnother note if the crc32 value doesn't match, the buildManifest or the device tree information for that file. you will also fail. \nApple uses md5 as an initial check, then crc32, date modified, File Signature. If any fail the image is reversed from disk, and the old image is restored to last state. \nHope this help you out!! \nUSE 3uTools to push the ios. in Itunes if your md5 checksum value isnt write then it says ipsw not signed. FYI\n\nA: The above answers are right...that if the ipsw is signed you can install (flash) it through iTunes  (PC/MAC) and the unsigned ipsw can't be install with iTunes\nBut if you are a Obstinate Person and still want to downgrade your ios version....then download the wished ipsw firmware from here--> http://ipsw.me and install (flash) with 3u tool....download from here--> http://www.3u.com \n\nA: iOS won't run unless Apple signs the IPSW.\nSo, unless you get Apple to sign the software in and save a copy of that signed certificate, you can't use that IPSW now that the window to get Apple to sign it has passed. \nSort of a sad trombone, game over situation. \n", "Q: Organizing bookmarks in Safari for Windows (Please tell me which site to post this on if this is the wrong one.)\nMy internet safety software is failing spectacularly with Chrome at the moment, and I have to uninstall it.

Right now, I can't even do that.\nI would also like to get rid of the awful black rectangle shown when I view all the bookmarks.  I was able to resize it slightly but it still takes up a lot of space.\n\nA: If you go into preferences, you should be able to tell safari which bookmarks folder to use for the Favorites Bar.\nI don't have a PC, but on Mac this setting is under General in Safari.\nAfter going to each website, the black boxes should go away, and be replaced by screenshots of the website.\n\n\n*\n\n*Go into Safari Settings.\n\n*There is an item called Favorites Bar.\n\n*You should be able to change the Fav Bar folder to the on you imported from Chrome.\n\n", "Q: Reattaching remote servers: no such file or directory in terminal I'm using the Connect to Server tool to mount a remote drive.

I'd recommend to fall back to unix tools like this...\n#\n# Get list of files...\n#   For example: all .txt files (not folders) under Downloads and below.\n#\ntry\n    set filelist to (do shell script \"find ~/Downloads -type f -name '*.txt'\")\non error eStr\n    # Do something here...\n    log eStr\nend try\n\n# Count the results\nset n to count every paragraph in filelist\n\n# Get a random no\nset n to (get random number from 1 to n)\n\n# Get the nth item from the results...\nget paragraph n of filelist\n\n\nA: Check out a short script (from another party) to see how you can use to rename files in an ascending order.  This way you can get a sense of how indexes work.  I made the script below that works for me.  It sets the index of the files that are in the folder.  In the folder I have each file named from file1.. file2.. file3..  \nThe script works as follows: sets the index based on the number of files, then chooses a random number between the lowest number to the index of files and then I use the GUI with \"System Events\" to tell terminal to open a file with the random number.  \nNote: I take advantage of a wonderful tool from Terminal that with tab you can finish writing to the end of the intended file so no need to type the rest.

If I go to \"Today\" on calendars all is well.  It's just when I have the months all on screen and tap a date that it won't open.\n\nA: When you're in year view, tapping a date never brings you into that day. The way it works is, in year view, tapping on a date blows up the month you selected, and from month view you can tap on a date to see the day.\n\nA: I have actually had a phone replaced because of this problem. It started doing this after downloading ios 9 and syncing my outlook calendar to my iPhone 6 plus. It took me anywhere from 6 to 10 taps on the date to get it to open.

You have to upgrade your R-SIM first, but I don't think there is already an available version for iOS 9.0.1. That's the nuisance of using special SIMs like that. If you update it with the latest iOS, it won't be blacklisted (you will still be able to use it), but it will be locked to the carrier it is originally locked to.\nAnother way to update is to jailbreak your iPhone but just like R-SIM, you can't always get the jailbroken iOS with the same version as the non-jailbroken version.\nThe best way to keep your iPhone have the latest iOS version is to buy a factory-unlocked iPhone.\n", "Q: What do I do if Time Machine says \"Waiting\" to view a particular backup?

Sometimes however, it uses the default search engine of my ISP. How can I fix this and what are the reasons it is happening?\n\nA: Assuming that everything's on the up-and-up with your ISP, this kind of behavior typically is a result of some connection failure between your ISP and Google (\"Hmmm, I can't find Google, so I'll route this to our search engine instead.\") - and in my experience it's most often due to DNS issues. \nOne easy way to figure out if it is due to DNS issues is change what DNS servers your network connects to. Two options are Google itself (8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4 for IPv4 service or 2001:4860:4860::8888 and 2001:4860:4860::8844 for IPv6) or OpenDNS (208.67.222.222 and 208.67.220.220 for IPv4 or 2620:0:ccc::2 and 2620:0:ccd::2 for IPv6).\nDepending on the current DNS servers your computer/network is currently using, you could even see faster lookup performance. \n", "Q: Does AppleCare warranty follow the device or the user?

(OR What am I doing wrong ?) I've recently transitioned to using OSX after using windows/linux for the last 14 years. Few things I like, few things I can't come to terms with. The biggest gripe is active window management on OSX. \nScenario : 2 windows open side by side. Say one of them is a chat. Another is a turn based card game.\nAction : Click on a control object of the passive window \nIn Windows, 2 things happen seamlessly. The window becomes active AND the control gets activated.\nIn OSX, with the same action, the window becomes active sometimes (depends on which application's window it is). Sometimes it doesn't get activated until you click on that windows titlebar (Happens a lot with the mail app). And then, only after it is activated, I can interact with anything inside that window.\nThis behaviour pisses me off. This, combined with the fact that there is no window snap available by default.

(Please read the whole question before flaming me)\nToday I updated my iPhone 4S (Model A1387) to iOS 9.0.1 from 8.4. Since the Wifi doesn't work with either of these versions I decided to downgrade the software to iOS 7.1.2. \nAfter I downloaded myself a IPSW-File for the iPhone 4S and tried to [Shift]+Update my phone in iTunes I received the error code 3194.\nAfter a quick web search I booted the iPhone into recovery mode and tried it again. After that I tried adapting my hosts file in Windows as showed on apples support page. This also didn't work.\nI also tried downloading the I P S W-File from different providers and also tried to use a third party tool called \"The Firmware Umbrella\". Then I found out, that recovery mode is not enough and I have to go in DFU mode.\nSince the black screen is an indicator of the DFU mode I was sure that it will work this time, since the DFU mode seems to be some kind of ultimate firmware override mode, but after hours of effort I'm still stuck with iOS 9 and nothing has worked out to bring me back to iOS 7.1.2.\nSo as the title states: How can I downgrade my iPhone 4S to iOS 7.1.2?\n(As I am going to jailbreak this device afterwards, you can also show a direct way to load a jailbreaked firmware)\n\nA: You cannot downgrade to anything less than 8.4.1 now. Apple signs iOS software, they currently only sign 8.4.1-9.0.1. This means that you can't downgrade to 7.1.2.\n\nA: Only way you can do this is if you have already saved SHSH blobs from the time when iOS 7.1.2 was current. You can no longer get them, nor can you use someone else's (as they are unique to the device). So unless you already have these blobs you cannot downgrade\nMore info\nApple signs iOS software and whenever you upgrade or restore, iTunes will first ask Apple servers if the upgrade is valid. At the moment (27th September 2015) only 8.4.1 and above are being signed. This means the only way to go lower is to sign the restore file (IPSW) yourself and this can only be find using valid SHSH blobs \n\nA: you can downgrade to ios 6.1.3 without blobs\n", "Q: Cannot set VLC as default through Get Info I cannot set VLC as default. \nI know about right-click → 'Get Info' but there is no drop-down to change the default so it's not possible to change it.

This was a Carbon system feature.\nFrom this SO answer some documentation is in Apple's ProcessSerialNumber section of the Carbon Process Manager Reference. This is now marked as a retired document and the methods are noted as removed in OS X 10.9 \nThus in 10.8 there is a -psn argument passed on the command line and the app then sees this and seems to be confused. I would note a couple of other things a 10.10 app will make calls to functions not in 10.8 so your app will likely crash later, also I suspect the app is reading the command line and this is not the best was as noted in the first link in in the comment by  Graham Miln\n\nA: It seems that older applications that used the Carbon API get started with this argument. If the application was already updated to a version not using Carbon any more, you can unregister the application from the LaunchServices database by:\n/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Versions/A/Support/lsregister -u /Applications/AppName.app/\n\nAfter this it can be re-launched from Finder to register the new version.

I saw this some time ago but have now forgotten. I've tried searching and can't find it.\n\nA: In case anyone has this question, I found it, but it only works for recorded actions.\nAfter you Record some clicks or other actions in Automator, they appear in a \"Watch Me Do\" action. You can then click on and drag an individual action out of that Action and release when the + sign appears. Automator will add a \"Run AppleScript\" action with the AppleScript that sends the same clicks and key presses to System Events.  \nYou can also simply Copy the action you want, switch over to AppleScript Editor, and paste to get the same code. \nExample: \"Click Skype in the Dock\" Event converts to the following AppleScript:\non run {input, parameters}\n    -- Click “Skype” in the Dock.\n    delay 7.872251\n    set timeoutSeconds to 2.000000\n    set uiScript to \"click UI Element \\\"Skype\\\" of list 1 of application process \\\"Dock\\\"\"\n    my doWithTimeout( uiScript, timeoutSeconds )\n    return input\nend run\n\non doWithTimeout(uiScript, timeoutSeconds)\n    set endDate to (current date) + timeoutSeconds\n    repeat\n        try\n            run script \"tell application \\\"System Events\\\"\n\" & uiScript & \"\nend tell\"\n            exit repeat\n        on error errorMessage\n            if ((current date) > endDate) then\n                error \"Can not \" & uiScript\n            end if\n        end try\n    end repeat\nend doWithTimeout\n\nHow to convert recorded events in Automator:\n\n\n\nA: It's impossible. You can do similar actions in applescript, but there is no way to convert an existing automator script to applescript.\n\nA: Create your Automator file as an \"Application\" type.\nTell your AppleScript to run your Automator app.\nSomething like: \nopen \"/Users/george/AutomatorFiles/MyScript.app\"\n\nWorks for me! \n", "Q: Will Apple still accept new iOS 8.4 apps?

Is there any way?\n\nA: I couldn't figure out where exactly iBooks stores imported books but I found out something else that might help you.\nSelect all books you want to backup and then drag them out of iBooks onto a Finder window and they sould be copied over.\nI am not sure but it seems unlikely, that your reading progress and/or bookmarks are being copied as well. If you don't mind that, than this would do the trick. \nOtherwise someone else might be able to locate the folder where iBooks stores the books.

I still like my mid 2009 13\" Macbook Pro. It's solid and running quite well. However, since Yosemite things are getting really laggy and slow, so I guess that my hardware is getting a bit old. Although I swapped the old HDD to a 3rd party SSD and upgraded to 8 GB of RAM, I still see lots of lag and slowness especially when my 27\" Cinema Display is hooked up via mini display port. Is there anything else I can do, in terms of hardware upgrade, to increase performance or is this just the end of the road for my baby?\n\n\nA: I found out that there is no more way to upgrade in terms of hardware since the last option would be a new CPU which cannot be replaced in the Macbook. Overclocking the CPU is no option either for safety reasons.\nHowever, upgrading Mac OS from Yosemite to El Capitan has greatly increased performance, so I guess I'm good for now.\n", "Q: Apple Music free trial ending As my free trial of Apple Music is due to end very soon, and I do not intend to pay for continued service, is there anything I should be doing before the trial ends to avoid any problems?\n\nA: You can turn off auto-renewal.

It's the gold-standard of all phones, but whatever you do, DON'T buy the 16 GB model. This isn't an iPhone 3GS or a cheap Android phone, it's a brand new iPhone 6S and it shoots 4K videos. Formatted, with iOS on it, you should have less than 12 GB to work with. Put 2 HD movies on it, and your just about out of storage. Get at least the 64 GB model, it's way worth the $100, IMO, plus when you go to sell it for an upgrade in a few years, you'll get back most of that $100, anyway. Me? I've already bought a 128 GB iPhone 6S on Verizon.\n\nWhen purchasing it in Apple Store, what options should I choose so the phone will bear no service contract which is useless for me?\n\nNot a lot, other than get the iPhone on T-Mobile, which should be available to buy outright ($750 for 64 GB model) and will come SIM-free and without a contact, just make sure that it will work on whatever carrier you wish to put it on in China.\n\nHow to make sure it is \"unlocked\" so it can be used with a local service company in China? What sort of SIM card does this iPhone require for it to be compatible?\n\nApple doesn't sell unlocked iPhone 6Ss, yet. I asked an Apple rep about this and they said maybe in a few months, but there is the very small chance that your carrier doesn't require the iPhone to be unlocked, like Straight Talk, but probably not in China. \n\nCould the interface language be set to Chinese language?\n\nYes. China and the US are Apple's biggest customers.\n", "Q: Is possible to distribute app only to one account?

If someone could help me get my iPhone back, that would be greatly appreciated.\nPlease and Thank You\n\nA: The iPhone was likely turned on only very briefly. Consequently, when you logged in and iCloud requested its location, it was unavailable.

The only resolutions you can export a video project to are:\n\n\n*\n\n*480p: 854x480\n\n*540p: 960x540\n\n*720p: 1280x720\n\n*1080p: 1920x1080\n\n\nNote that all of these are 16:9 (1.778) whereas the target you're after is about 3:2 (1.66).\nYou can certainly add black borders or otherwise crop/frame videos in iMovie, so it could be a stepping stone to another tool. But It's probably not the tool you want if that precise output format is required.\nAlso remember that many video players will automatically resize and add black borders on playback to best fit the screen's aspect ratio.\n", "Q: iMessage is not functioning properly I just updated to iOS9 and all hell broke loose on iMessage-every now and then, messages that I receive would pop up on the screen for a second and then disappear! I have tried restarting iMessage multiple times but the issue seems to persist. And this has been occurring only since the update. What must I do to rectify this situation? \n\nA: As one potential route to take, IPSWs (firmware files) for iOS 8.4.1 are still being signed as of the time of this posting (according to ipsw.me). If you act quickly, you could try downgrading and see if the problem persists.\nFrom an article by Realty Today:\n\n\n*\n\n*Back up your device data and settings so you don't lose them when you downgrade. There are two ways to back up. First is via transferring them to your computer. Plug in your device to a computer, open iTunes, and click Back Up Now on the device page. The second option is via iCloud. Go to Settings, iCloud, and tap the toggle button to turn on Backup. Ensure that you have enough space for all your data. Apple provides 5GB of free storage only.\n\n\n*Download the iOS 8.4.1 IPWS file that corresponds to your device model.\n\n\n*Plug in your iPhone to your computer, open iTunes, and go to the device page. Press Option/Alt on your keyboard (for Mac OS X) or Shift key (for Windows), then at the same time click Restore iPhone.\n\n\n*When the explorer box popped up, select the iOS 8.4.1 IPWS file you've downloaded then click Open to start the installation process.\n\n\n*When iOS 8.4.1 has been installed, iTunes will prompt you to restore backup. Click Yes to have your data and settings back.\n\n", "Q: What is ksfetch process on Mac? Sometimes I see a ksfetch process on my Mac. After a little googling I found out that it is Google software updater. However, there is no detailed answer i.e. what is ksfetch process used for? Is it really required? Can I get rid of it?\nSometimes it uses my internet bandwidth so it frustrates me hence the query. Thanks.\n\nA: You can uninstall it, type /Library/Google/GoogleSoftwareUpdate/GoogleSoftwareUpdate.bundle/Contents/Resources/GoogleSoftwareUpdateAgent.app/Contents/Resources/ksinstall --help to see available options. \n--nuke can uninstall everything related to it, just like this: /Library/Google/GoogleSoftwareUpdate/GoogleSoftwareUpdate.bundle/Contents/Resources/GoogleSoftwareUpdateAgent.app/Contents/Resources/ksinstall --nuke\n\nA: Keystone Fetch / ksfetch\nThe ksfetch process on OS X is part of Google Chrome's update mechanism. The ks prefix is an abbreviation of Keystone. The process appears to be responsible for fetching updates to Google's products. It is this role that uses your bandwidth.\nUsing slick's answer you can disable the corresponding process that uses ksfetch.\nAlternatively, it appears possible to adjust the frequency of update checks:\n\nEntering the following code into your terminal will make it check once a week rather than every few hours:\ndefaults write com.google.Keystone.Agent checkInterval 604800\n\n\nTo learn more about, follow the links below:\n\n\n*\n\n*Little Snitch + Google Chrome = ksfetch issues\n\n*ksfetch, little-snitch, the escalation of mutually fooling …\n\nA: They have changed this command to --nuke instead of --uninstall and the path is now different as well.  So the new command for all users would be:\n/Library/Google/GoogleSoftwareUpdate/GoogleSoftwareUpdate.bundle/Contents/Resources/GoogleSoftwareUpdateAgent.app/Contents/Resources/ksinstall --nuke\n\n\nA: There is an issue with Google Chrome that it creates a temp file to check for updates every x hours.  Since it's making a new temp file for some reason it sets off Little Snitch, which is quite annoying.\nBy entering the following code into Terminal, it will make it check once a week rather than every few hours:\ndefaults write com.google.Keystone.Agent checkInterval 604800\n\nHopefully one of the next versions of Google Chrome they will address this, as it is very annoying having to click allow/deny every x hours.\n\nA: Yes, you can disable it.\nTo do this just for you in Terminal type:\n~/Library/Google/GoogleSoftwareUpdate/GoogleSoftwareUpdate.bundle/Contents/Resources/GoogleSoftwareUpdateAgent.app/Contents/Resources/install.py --uninstall\nfor all users:\n/Library/Google/GoogleSoftwareUpdate/GoogleSoftwareUpdate.bundle/Contents/Resources/GoogleSoftwareUpdateAgent.app/Contents/Resources/install.py --uninstall\nOn some machines it's ksinstall instead of install.py.\n\nA: ksinstall didn't seem to do anything, no matter how many incantation of --nuke I used.  Nor ksadmin.\nThis seemed to help:\n $ ps -ef | grep ksfetch\n 501   976   855   0  3:54PM ??         0:00.09 /Users/user/Library/Google/GoogleSoftwareUpdate/GoogleSoftwareUpdate.bundle/Contents/MacOS/ksfetch\n\nthen rename it\n sudo mv /Users/user/Library/Google/GoogleSoftwareUpdate/GoogleSoftwareUpdate.bundle/Contents/MacOS/ksfetch /Users/user/Library/Google/GoogleSoftwareUpdate/GoogleSoftwareUpdate.bundle/Contents/MacOS/ksfetch.dis\n\nIt goes away for \"awhile\"\nIf that doesn't work that this seems to help (if it's bandwidth you're concerned with):\n $ irb\n > loop { sleep 0.5; system(\"killall ksfetch\") }\n\nSee also https://superuser.com/questions/1359017/how-do-i-disable-automatic-updates-of-google-chrome-on-mac-os-x/1453781#1453781\n\nA: Software update checks really shouldn't be using noticeable bandwidth or CPU, although actual Updates may, of course.\nBut this is Google software, a notorious RAM and disk space hog. (If you didn't know that Chrome archives old versions inside the current one, bloating at every update, here's a short summary of to how to fix it). So...\nAs a fan of the GUI approach, my instinct is always to open the .plist first, located in this case at:\n\n~/Library/Preferences/com.google.Keystone.Agent.plist\n\n\nHere you can see the default SU checkInterval value is 18000 seconds (5 hours). With a suitable editor, or the terminal command in previous replies, you can change this to eg 604800 (7 days).\nHowever, it's also possible to edit lastCheckStartDate and lastServerCheckDate, which I'm going to experiment with in case this fools Keystone into to laying low until a set date. Here I'm setting them one month in the future to see what happens.\n\nI've had major issues with Keystone in the past (and struggled to kill and completely remove it) and there are websites dedicated to claims that it slows Macs and causes high CPU usage on Window Server.\nI can't comment on the current version. For now, I'm hoping that messing with the lastServerCheckDate will put the Keystone dragon to sleep until a predetermined date.\nI'll post any insights I gain.\n", "Q: iOS 9 features don't work in iPad mini I have an old iPad mini and updated it to iOS 9. However, the features don't work, such as Siri suggestions and drawing in notes app. Could somebody explain a remedy or what is up with Apple? Thanks.\nI will NOT system reset as I have done so already. Maybe 9.1 beta will work.\n\nA: Apple maintained support for all iOS 8 devices in iOS 9 but that meant that some devices couldn't fully support some of the new features. If it's the first generation iPad mini you have, drawing in Notes is not supported. Support starts with the iPad mini 2.\nI haven't seen anything about Siri Suggestions not being supported. You could verify that your device is supported and Siri Suggestions are turned on under Settings > General > Spotlight Search. There should be a toggle for Siri Suggestions if supported.\n\nA: The new Notes feature is not available on mini 1s.

Perhaps you can say more about what you're trying to accomplish. You can examine the potential window properties with:\ntell application \"System Events\" to get the properties of every window of (every process whose visible is true)\n\n", "Q: Apple Music / iTunes: Cannot add track to playlist when iPhone connected via wifi Following occurs when using Apple Music / itunes: \nI'm in itunes, listening to some music from an Apple Music Playlist. I am also connected to a wifi network, the same network that my iPhone is on. \nWhen I like a track I want to add it to one of my own playlists so I click on the three dots, select 'add to playlist', select the correct playlist and all is well. \nHowever, when itunes shows the little phone icon in the icon bar (indicating my iPhone was detected in the same wifi and wifi sync is available, although I am not actually syncing anything) the option to add a song to a playlist disappears. It is no longer available when I click the three dots next to a song. As soon as I eject the iPhone, the option is available once more. \nWhat is happening here (why does add to playlist disappear), and how can I keep adding music to a playlist even when the iPhone is connected via wifi sync?\n\nA: This problem has been bugging me so much, it seemed so random but yes it definitely disappears the moment you plug in the iPhone, then appears again the moment you take it out.\nI assume this is a bug and will be fixed soon, but here are a couple workarounds:\n\n\n*\n\n*As you say, eject the iPhone either by physically disconnecting, or clicking the eject icon.\n\n*You can click \"Add to My Music\", then go to your library, find the relevant song, and drag/drop into a playlist.

He was able to use the camera from the lock screen without having access to the locked phone.\nThese photos completely wiped our family's Photo stream (and replaced our vacation photos with nonsense). Also, the storage was filled and my son couldn't even make a phone call before we deleted the 1,200 photos.\nDeleting the photos was even more annoying. Can you imagine the tedious process of deleting 1,200 photos on an iPhone?\nThis was very annoying, and also a usecase Apple may not have thought of. \nSomebody mentioned that you can disable control center on lock screen. (Settings>Control Centre>Access on Lock Screen). To my surprise, this brings back a camera button on the lock screen. So that didn't work.\nAn old post suggested that the only possible solution would be to completely disable camera and FaceTime. But this is not really a solution (would be comparable to painting the camera lens black).\nBack to the question: In iOS9, how do I disable camera access on the lock screen?\nRelated (but not quite the answer):\n\n\n*\n\n*Removing camera button on iPhone lock screen – (Feb 2015, AskDifferent)\n\n*How do you disable the camera from lock screen on iPad? – 2014, Apple Support Forum\n\n*I WANT TO DISABLE THE LOCK SCREEN CAMERA – 2013, Apple Support Forum\n\n\nA: It's looking like you cannot suppress the photo icon from the lock screen and iOS 9 has no difference in behavior from iOS 8 (so this really looks like a duplicate question to me since iOS 5 in fact...) unless you disable the camera entirely - lock screen or not using a MDM profile or restriction in the settings app.\n\n\n*\n\n*Removing camera button on iPhone lock screen\nThe only countermeasure to that malicious behavior would be to not let the camera participate in iCloud photo stream so that once the camera had filled up the storage on the phone, the phone storage would be filled.\nBulk deleting images is something that's easy with a Mac and the Image Capture app.\nIn my opinion, this is a bug, and Apple should allow a restriction to prevent use of the camera from the lock screen. You could cut off the camera entirely using restrictions or an MDM profile, but that would prevent all use of the camera and not just from the locked state.\nI would reach out to iCloud support and explain the data loss - they can point you to the upload restrictions and possibly tune them using your actual bad experience with Photo Stream.\n\nA: General> restrictions turn on restrictions and turn off camera\n\nA: Jailbreak there's a tweak that can disable it\n", "Q: Can i download facetime for android? A lot of my friends have iOS devices who use FaceTime and I have a Samsung Galaxy S4. Is it possible for me to download/use FaceTime on my Android Phone?\n\nA: I wouldn't expect FaceTime on Andriod to be inherently secure like it is on iOS. There have been many attempts to port it / reverse engineer the security, but none seem to work without trusting your iCloud credentials with a third party. If you go that route, be sure to use an application specific password and not grant them your actual iCloud password. \n\nA: The short answer...  no.  \nFaceTime is an app designed for use on iPhones.   While there are other methods of video conferencing available for use between the different phone types, the use of FaceTime is exclusive to iPhones.   \n", "Q: Why have pictures on Instagram got blurry since my iPad has been updated to iOS9? I recently updated to iOS9 on my iPad4, and ever since then the pictures on Instagram have been blurry (It looked fine previously). Is this an Instagram bug, old Hardware, or something else?\n\nLet me know if this is the wrong site to ask on.\n\nA: My suspicion is that the Instagram app was programmed for the older OS and needs an update. You could check their support forums, but it also might be something you just wait out for the next few app updates to post from the vendor.\nIt also could just be server side changes - if your iPad isn't served the complete resolution images, you won't have them. (i.e. the problem might not exist on your device at all).\n\nA: Turns out I missed the update that was released with the new OS, after the update, everything works great!\n", "Q: iOS9 photos - remove image from screenshots folder that isn't a screenshot So I have 3 photos in the Screenshots folder in the Photos app of iOS 9. They aren't screenshots, but they may be being classified that way since I imported them from the internet. How do I change their classification so that they're not in that folder?\n\nA: The screenshot folder is a folder automatically. The user can not handle this file.

The Spaces feature in OS X is great. It would be even greater if I could save a Space and recall it later, like the \"Projects\" feature that's available in many IDEs.\nAnother way to think about it would be like how OS X, when shutting down, prompts the user to re-open all programs. Saving or recalling a Space would be something like that.\nIs this possible in OS X? Maybe through some kind of AppleScript hackery.\nAlternatively, are there any third-party programs that accomplish this?\n\nA: The paid App \"Moom\" (£7.99 Mac App Store) can save and restore desktop layouts (amongst other window related tricks). I don't think it actually starts applications though, but if they are already running it will arrange them for you. You might be able to combine an automator action to run a bunch of programs and then have Moom arrange them for you?\nI have multiple applications open for marking student work (browser, word processor, text snippets, marking app etc.) and use Moom to give me a consistent layout for marking each type of assignment. It works well for this.\n", "Q: Found an iPhone submerged in a river, what (if any) components may be salvageable? I was walking in the woods the other day and while wading in a nearby river I found an iPhone submerged in the water (and partially in the mud).  No way to know how long it has been there, but I would assume at the very least several weeks (possibly months).  Naturally I assume it is dead beyond recovery.  But are there any components that might be salvageable?\n\nA: It depends. Other then testing each individual part, no one could really say. What I'd do is take the whole thing apart, rinse everything off with water (distilled would be best, but at this point it probably doesn't make a difference) and clean everything with isopropyl alcohol. Dry everything off and reassemble the iPhone. Try to power it on. If it powers on, take note of what still doesn't work and email the Apple ID associated with it (maybe you could get it back to them and charge a repair fee, they may also just let you keep it and, if they're VERY trusting, let you use their Apple ID password to take the iCloud lock off of it). If not, sell it as-is on eBay, where, depending on the model, you still might get $100+, $200+ for it.\n", "Q: My iPhone 5s is frozen with iTunes symbol and plug in picture with arrow My phone is stuck with the image of charger and cord, up arrow and iTunes icon - I can't turn iPhone on or off it seems. Will it restart on its own?  I tried holding the power button down for the ten seconds and then just the home key but that doesn't work either. \n\nA: Your iPhone is stuck in Recovery Mode. Connect your phone to a computer with iTunes and do a hard reset on it (hold down both your home and sleep button for several seconds).\nFrom a small article on getting in and out of Recovery Mode:\n\nTo get out of recovery mode, make sure your USB cable is connected to both the laptop running iTunes and your device.You may need to hold the home button while connecting your USB cable as above.\nNow hold the home and sleep/wake buttons together until you see the Apple logo appear. Don’t let go until then – it can take several seconds: the recovery graphic will disappear and a black screen might be shown for a while, but keep holding the buttons down until the white Apple appears.\n\n", "Q: How to deal with unzip error on a large file in OSX?

For my work as a media professional I have been using the rsync frontend arrsync to back up my work, as time machine doesn't have the features I need. Arrsync, however, has not been in development for some time, and I was wondering if anyone knew of a decent alternative.\nSpecifically I need something with arrsync's \"unidirectional merge\" function, which basically just adds new files or overwrites old files with newer versions to my backup hard drives.\nThis allows me to remove projects from my computer I don't need immediately in order to save space, but still keeps them in backup. In other words, the function does not simply create a snapshot, but an ever-growing collection of all my past projects.\nI also need something with an easy to use and understand UI. I realise I can create custom scripts for rsync, but there are other less computer literate people in my office who rely on this program as well.\nI have also tried simply copying things across using finder, but this becomes incredibly tedious, even with some of the smarter copying capabilities of OSX, as directory structures can be quite complex.\nSorry this has gotten quite long (I realise I have some frustratingly specific needs!)\nDoes anyone know of a program, be it standalone of as an rsync frontend, that has these functions and is relatively up-to-date?\nCheers!\n\nA: I think Carbon Copy Cloner 4 would do the trick here.\nIts major selling point is that it creates bootable backups, but it can copy folders with data also.\nIf I understand right, the equivalent of that Arrsync merge function would be CCC's \"SafetyNet\" feature, with \"Prune archives in the SafetyNet when:\" set to Never.\n(Edited:) I think the closest equivalent of that Arrsync \"unidirectional merge\" function would be:\n\n*\n\n*use Advanced Settings\n\n*set \"SafetyNet\" to \"Don't delete anything\"\n\n*set \"SafetyNet pruning\" to Never.\n\nFrom http://bombich.com/kb/ccc4/release-notes\n\nCarbon Copy Cloner 4.0.2\n... When the \"Don't delete anything\" Advanced SafetyNet option is specified, older versions of modified items are not deleted, they are moved to the SafetyNet. SafetyNet pruning is now available for tasks configured with this option.\n\nSo if I understand right (this will need testing!), this will add new files to the backup, put new versions of changed files into place, and move the out-dated versions to the SafetyNet folder, where you can delete them.  I think this achieves an \"ever-growing collection of all my past projects\".\nCCC calls rsync to do the actual work, so it is fast.  You might consider it \"standalone\", though, as it doesn't give access to all rsync options.\nI think the UI in the new version 4 is great.\nThere is a 30-day trial.\n\nA: I use iBackup for this - currently I use it to clone certain folders to an external drive on a schedule, but I have used it the same way you describe. It's just a gui for rsync and ditto, and has some access to more advanced switches\n\nA: You gotta check out DropSync!\nI think it does exactly what you're looking for.  \nAlso I'd say it sounds like you might need 2 apps.\nMaybe use DropSync to do your push/pull syncing of your 'working copy'\nthen a backup app up to do your backups.\nShameless plug because you said simple UI:\nBackaroo does backups:\nhttp://bonhardcomputing.com/backaroo/\nand Truck is a simple rsync GUI for throwing data around with rsync: \n http://bonhardcomputing.com/truck/\n\nA: Try Chronosync - http://econtechnologies.com/chronosync.html\nI'm not sure what's under the hood but it's super simple, stable, and works well for your stated needs.

Dropbox, PushBullet, Thunderbird and a dozen other apps create notifications. Is it possible to log these in a Unix-like way?\nI dislike the tiny messages popping up for a few seconds and then disappearing without a trace.\nBasically, I want to be able to grep a file which contains a line for each notification.\n\nA: As was linked by Arthur Hammer, https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/142811/37689 states that notifications are stored in an SQLite database. The following python script should get you started:\n#!/usr/bin/env python\nimport os\nimport re\nimport sqlite3\n\n# Location of notification centers database under Yosemite\ntmp = os.environ['TMPDIR']\nconn = sqlite3.connect(tmp + '/../0/com.apple.notificationcenter/db/db')\n\nfor notification in conn.execute('SELECT * from notifications'):\n    encoded_data = str(notification[-1]) # last item\n    clean = re.sub('[^\\w\\s-]', '', encoded_data) # remove some funny stuff (fixme: removes too much?)\n    sp = clean.split('\\t')\n    # Find NSActualdeliverydate, message content seems to always come after this\n    for ix in range(len(sp)):\n        if 'NSActualdeliverydate' in sp[ix]:\n            break\n    # Skip blanks\n    for ix in range(ix+1, len(sp)):\n        if sp[ix] != '': break\n\n    print 'notification', sp[ix].replace('_', '\\n').strip()\n\nconn.close()\n\nYou can then either pipe this to a file and then grep the file, or just grep the output of the script directly.\n\nA: @oystein's answer is great, but i guess it only works for yosemite because the sqlite db for high sierra is a different db model...\nso i found this easy tool... (which works for high seirra perfectly)\nhttps://github.com/ydkhatri/MacForensics/blob/master/macNotifications.py\njust run with your db path input and output path .csv that you would like to create\nnote: to find your notification center db path, view this... https://stackoverflow.com/a/26777027\nglhf!\n\nA: First locate the sqlite files db and db-wal where notification reside.\nAs in mojave, could be found using this command:\nlsof -p $(ps aux | grep -m1 usernoted | awk '{ print $2 }')| awk '{ print $9 }' | grep 'db2/db$' | xargs dirname\n\nThen as @greenhouse mentioned, MacFronsics script is good choice to parse db file. As far as I test the script supports mojave as well.\nIn case someone fail to get latest notification, the most recent notifications are not likely in main db. Directly parsing db file would end up with old notifications. If you want latest notifications, remember migrate the record in db-wal(Write AHead Log) file to db first.\n", "Q: How to force a sync update between Gmail contacts and iPhone with iOS 9? I am successfully synchronizing my iPhone contacts with my GMail account. \nWhen adding a new contact in my GMail account, the new contact takes a few hours to sync to the device. This is cumbersome, because often I add a contact on GMail and wish to call that contact from my iPhone.\nIs there a way to force an iPhone contact sync update with my GMail account, so that new contacts will be immediately updated on the iPhone?\n\nA: External account settings can be found under Settings-> Mail, Contacts, Calendars-> Fetch New Data.\nConfigure the frequency of synchronization on the bottom of the screen. It is possible to update in \"real time\" if \"Push\" is turned on, but this will have a negative impact on battery life.\n\nA: [update 2016-09-02] in iOS 9.3.5 you can simply pull down in the Contacts list to force a sync.\nIf this doesn't appear to work, make sure the problem is with syncing and not with the data iOS \"sees\" in the Google contacts by testing on a separate contact. For example, I had a problem (while on iOS 10.2) where the phone number wouldn't sync because it was in a wrong field of the Google contact.\n\nIn earlier iOS versions there used to be a sync button in the upper-left corner of Contacts app, now it seems to be gone (though some claim it can reappear under certain circumstances). There also used to be a way to force sync by pulling down in the Contacts app -> Groups view, but it doesn't work for me (and others) in iOS 9.1 either. This discussions.apple.com thread is useful to see the evolution of this feature.\nLuckily, there's another thread with a collection of weird workarounds to force a sync without toggling contacts sync off/on or restarting the device. The following two ways worked for me to force syncing with Google contacts on iOS 9.1:\n\n\n*\n\n*Going to Settings -> iCloud (which incidentally triggers Google sync(?!)), then switching to Contacts.\n\n*Going to Settings -> Mail, Contacts, Calendars -> Gmail -> Account -> tap in any field (Name, Email or Description) but don't make any changes -> Done, switch to Contacts.\n\n", "Q: In iOS, where are \"Recently Deleted\" folders located? (Jailbroken iDevice) I have a jailbroken iPad 4th gen with 15,000 pictures in Recently Deleted folder that iPad is unable to either recover or delete. Probably too many files for those functions to work.\nI've installed NoRecentlyDelete tweak but it's a bit late.\nSo my question is, where is the folder(s) that holds those pictures so I can manually delete or recover them.\nNote that I have access to raw file system on my iPad both via PC and iFile on iPad.\nCheers.\n\nA: The deleted pictures are going to be in /var/mobile/Media/DCIM/ with the rest of your non-deleted pictures. When you delete a photo, iOS modifies a SQLite database located at /var/mobile/Media/PhotoData/Photos.sqlite to change which album the photo is stored in. Essentially, the photo's album is changed to 'Recently Deleted'. To get a list, you can run this SQLite query which returns a list of all deleted photos (including permanently deleted photos, which you will have to ignore).\nSELECT\n    (\n        \"/var/mobile/Media/\"\n        || ZGENERICASSET.ZDIRECTORY\n        || \"/\"\n        || ZGENERICASSET.ZFILENAME\n    ) AS \"FILENAME\"\nFROM\n    ZGENERICASSET\nWHERE\n    ZGENERICASSET.ZTRASHEDSTATE = 1\n;\n\n\n", "Q: Photos: Search all photos captured by a particular device (iPhone 5s) Is there any way in the new Photos app to search for all images taken from a particular device?

They tried a load of things (none of which worked), and eventually they then asked me to delete the WhatsApp Documents & Data storage. Despite it saying that only 350MB was being used by WhatsApp, deleting this immediately freed up around 2.8GB (350MB plus the ~2.5GB of \"lost\" space) in iCloud.\n\nA: Manage your iCloud storage\nLearn how to manage your iCloud storage if you reach or exceed your storage limit.\nYou can manage your storage by upgrading your iCloud storage plan or reducing the amount of storage that you're using. You can reduce your iCloud storage by choosing which apps and backups to store, and you can move or delete documents, photos, and email messages that you no longer need.*\nUse these steps to see how much iCloud storage is available in your account:\nOn your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you're using iOS 8 or later, tap Settings > iCloud > Storage > Manage Storage.\n\n*If you're using an earlier version of iOS, tap Settings > iCloud > Storage & Backup.\n\n*On your Mac, go to Apple menu > System Preferences, click iCloud, then click Manage.\n\n*On your PC, open iCloud for Windows, then click Manage.\n\n\nBefore you delete anything, you might want to archive or make copies of your iCloud data.\n", "Q: Is there a keyboard shortcut to pin a tab?

The trash for the computer is empty but those images did not show up in that trash so I am assuming that iPhoto still has its own trash somewhere...I just don't know where.\n\nA: When you migrate iPhoto to Photos, Apple does some magic and uses hard links to allow the new Photos app to have its own library, while not taking up twice the amount of space.

In the display arrangement screen, the MacBook Pro is therefore a bigger rectangle than the external display. Is there a way to size these rectangles regarding their \"real world size\" instead of resolution? I'm annoyed by my cursor teleporting vertically whenever I move from one display to another.\n\nA: Short answer, no. \n'Full HD' is actually tiny compared to the resolution of a retina screen -  1920x1080 vs 2880x1800\nThe Displays control panel really has no idea how big the screen is, only what resolutions it is capable of.\nThe relationship it displays is a direct result of that - & your mouse will jump according to how you set the images of the screens against each other.\nThe most logical method is to align the tops of the screens in the control panel, so you at least have one matching point of reference.\nI have 2 identical monitors, so it's not so easy to illustrate - but you want this...\n\nrather than this...\n\nThe screen images will snap to 'sensible' locations, but you are actually free to position them any way you like, simply by dragging one of them relative to the other.\n\nA: Long answer, yes!\nI think you want something like this, right?\n\nMain ways to get this result:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use a Mini Display Port (i.e. thunderbolt) to DisplayPort connector, not an HDMI to HDMI connector - you will likely see a lot more available resolutions (i.e. everything above 1920x1080 aka 1080p) if you have a hi-res (e.g. 4k) monitor\n\n*Use SwitchResX. It is quite fiddly to use, but it opens up a bunch of resolutions which your monitor supports but which Mac OS hides by default\n\n\n*\n\n*You can also use it to add additional Scaled resolutions (same as scaling on your retina display, i.e. they don't change the available underlying screen resolutions, but they do change the apparent space on the screen)\n\n*And you can even add Custom screen resolutions, but these are super-advanced and probably not what you need!\n\n\n*A simpler rough equivalent to SwitchResX, but it won't give you as many options, is RDM which can be installed via a download linked from the GitHub page, or via Brew (brew install avibrazil-rdm).\n\n\nThe above lets you have a LOT more control over the real estate on your external monitor, and then - as you no doubt already know - you can also scale the internal MacBook LCD display:\n\nCombine these. Try dragging some medium size window back and forth between the external monitor and the laptop screen - using all the above, you should be able to find scaling settings which make the sizes match while still giving you a lot of space for your app windows, so no cursor jumps!\n", "Q: Terminal: List only and specifically, the 5th file in a directory I am wondering if there is a Terminal command which will specifically list the 5th file in a directory. I was initially using the ls | head -5 command to complete this, however it listed all other files as well as the fifth, an action which is undesirable for the purpose i have in mind for the proposed command.\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: In addition to head, use the tail command:\nls | head -5 | tail -n 1\n\nwhere the -n 1 argument displays the last line of the input. \nFor more info on the command, type man tail in Terminal.\n", "Q: 5 Minute Yosemite Boot Time? My spring 2011 Macbook Pro with 5400 rpm drive takes 5 minutes from pressing the on button to boot. I have about 400 GB of RAW and NEF (Nikon camera) files and only Photoshop and Lightroom installed. It seems to constantly be writing to the HD, and there is a lag time when typing or using drop-down menus. Can anyone offer any suggestions on what might be causing this? I have verified the disk and it found no problems.\nI upgraded from Mavericks. Machine originally had Snow Leopard.\nI have never done a clean install.\nDisk has been verified and found no problems.\nAll peripherals have been disconnected.\nI have not reset the printing system.\nWiFi is on.\nAll login items have not been removed.\nFileVault is turned on.\nWhat help steps are next to diagnose the slow performance of this Mac?\n\nA: Boot in verbose mode to see what is so slow. Then check your backup, actually do a backup before anything else. Failing storage is a likely culprit and slowing io is the bellwether indicator if you get one at all. \nAlso, your isolation steps are superb. Remove all accessories, clean install, etc...\nlastly, check for io errors in console.app. Verification can show no unrecoverable errors well past the point where rewrite and other mechanisms are compensating for failures in the storage. \nIf all that fails, start benchmarking RAM, network and CPU. Process List App\nAlso, check for swap: High memory usage, macbook pro retina feeling sluggish\n\nA: Would just add, that I have often been called in to sort a slow Mac for a friend or colleague after a system 'upgrade'. Its is always better to clone off (backup) your data, wipe the drive and do a clean install of an OS / Applications rather than an upgrade which will 'merge' files and software from two operating systems. Whilst Apple Migration Assistant does a reasonably good job of this, it can bring over system issues, apps that wont launch (under the new OS), bloatware and corrupt preferences.   \nAlso - check (first) that the OS you are moving two is fully compatible with your hardware. Even though your Mac can technically can run the OS, this does not mean its the best OS for your particular hardware setup. Newer OS / Software might need more ram for example, which would inevitably slow your Mac down.\n", "Q: \"File Open\" dialog is missing sidebar items I'm having the strangest issue since updating to OS X El Capitan. My \"Open File\" dialogs show the sidebar but all my main (and useful) locations are missing. Take a look at this screenshot. This screenshot shows Keychain Access but this happens in Safari when I'm trying to attach a file to Gmail for example, or uploading an image to Facebook.\nWhat I would like is for the sidebar to show my home directories, such as Desktop, Documents, Downloads, etc.\nHelp?\n \n\nA: Open a Finder window; you can drag folders onto the sidebar, and they’ll appear under a badly-named “Favorites” section.\nWeird, but I think I like it. Keeps the plebeians out of trouble, makes it mo’ fancier for power users.\nEDIT  haha it doesn’t have any memory… stuff dropped into Favorites disappears. What is going on here… filed in Apple Radar #22916266\n\nA: Today I received a reply to this very bug report I posted in nov, 2016. It's resolved in 10.13 GM, according to it.\n\n\nA: I had the same issue and fixed it in the following way:\n\n\n*\n\n*While in a \"Open File\" or \"Save As\" dialog box (that doesn't show Favorites), drag any folder to the sidebar. This will create a \"Favorites\" category in the sidebar that only shows that folder.\n\n*Reboot.\nAfter rebooting, all of the dialog box sidebars should show Favorites as it appears in Finder, synchronized.\n\nA: I had the same problem.  I resolved it by going into the Finder and making a change to the Favorites area (eg dragged a folder in Favorites up one position).  After closing the finder window and reopening to make sure the change stuck, I rebooted.  File/Open then worked as normal.\n\nA: The solutions above are both complicated and do not work. Kill sharedfilelistd and restart Finder. Problem solved (at least for a week or two according to my experience).\n\n\n*\n\n*Launch the Activity Monitor, \n\n*Kill as many processes called sharedfilelistd as you can,\n\n*Hold Option/Alt key and right click Finder icon in the dock,\n\n*Relaunch Finder,\n\n*Enjoy.\n\n\nA: Go to Finder -> Preferences -> Sidebar, and put a check next to all your Favorites.\n\n\nInstalling El Capitan might have reset a few of your original settings (it reset my desktop backgrounds). It comes with the territory when installing major updates, but this should fix it.\n\nA: *\n\n*Go to your user library in Finder. Hold down ⌥ while opening the Go menu and click Library. \n\n*Navigate to the Preferences folder.\n\n*Remove any files that are or contain com.apple.finder.plist. (The removal of those files will very likely reset your Favourites list in Finder.)\n\n*Restart or log out and log back in again then empty the trash and try again. \nRestarting might not be necessary. As madpoet says:\n\nYou can also relaunch Finder if you don't want to reboot or log out. Right click on Finder icon while you're pressing ⌥ and you'll see the Relaunch option there.\n\n\n\nAlternatively, you can use this Bash oneliner by Christophe Marois:\ncd ~/Library/Preferences && sudo find com.apple.finder.plist* -exec rm {} \\; && killall Finder\n\n", "Q: How can I configure fail2ban for use with OS X I've seen instructions for configuring fail2ban on BSD using pf but I'm not sure how these can be adapted to configure the fail2ban rules that ship with homebrew to configure Yosemite's firewall for safety.\nWhat changes do I need to make, and to which files, to enable fail2ban safely on my OSX server?\n\nA: If you are running the macosx server product (as well as running macosx as a server), you can try activating the adaptive firewall (man afctl(8)). It is a tool that watches for auth failures and blocks the originating host for a short time. Not quite as flexible as fail2ban but catches some of the services that don't log auth failures. \n", "Q: Enter on Zagg keyboard with iOS causes message to be sent I just updated my iPad and now when I hit the enter button it sends messages.

On both the home screen and lock screen, I use portrait-oriented wallpaper images that feature full-length pictures of people. When the unit is rotated to landscape orientation, the iPad centers the image - cutting off the heads of the people in the images. \nThere's a feature when setting the wallpaper image that allows one to shift the position, but you're effectively forced to set it for landscape and let it crop the sides when you switch to portrait. What I want it to do is align the top corners of the image with the top corners of the screen at all times, and have it crop the bottom when you switch to landscape.\nIs there a way (hidden setting? third-party app? image-embedded meta-data?) to control the position of the wallpaper on an iPad running iOS9?\n\nA: No; iOS does not provide any options or control for wallpaper positioning - you set the file and it does what it does.\n\nA: I don't think there's way to change the position, unless you edit and prepare the wallpaper image yourself. \nHere are general guidelines, to make it work for both portrait and landscape orientations.\nIf you look at the specs for a first- or second-generation iPad, the device comes with a resolution of 1024 x 768 at 132 pixels per inch. The 2012 iPad comes with a resolution of 2048 x 1536 pixels, which is exactly double that of the iPad and iPad 2. The iPad rotates the background depending on how you have the device oriented. You’ll need to take this into account when creating your wallpaper. The 1024 (2048) pixels is the long side and the 768 (1536) pixels is on the shorter end of the iPad. \n\n\n*\n\n*Open up an image editing program, e.g. Photoshop.\n\n*Create a new image in a square with edges of 1024 x 1024 (2048 x 2048 px for the new iPad). \n\n\nThe most important thing to know here, that image has to be square, to provide full coverage of the screen in both directions.\n\nA: No, this is not possible natively...but there is a workaround. Basically, you can do this:\nPut your photo onto a blank Word doc using either the iOS Word app or Pages if you have it. Center the image so that there is about a one inch margin of whitespace around it. Take a screenshot of this document. By taking the screenshot on your iPad, you basically gaurante that the result will be exactly the right size and resolution for your specific device model.\nWhen you set this screenshot as your background (and turn off perspective zoom), the white boarder will make your picture centered in the middle of the screen. If you rotate to landscape, the white border will get cut off like before, but the picture itself will remain intact in the center of the screen.\nDepending on the aspect ratio of you photo, you may need play with the margin sizes until you get it just the way you like it.\nAlso, the reason I mentioned the Pages app above was because it had a feature that helped you perfectly center a picture in your document. I'm not sure if this feature is still available, however, since I have not used the app much after MS Word came out for iOS.\n", "Q: Can not record iPhone screen from OSX Why am I not able to record screen of my iPhone.

The short version: \nI was running Boot Camp on my Retina MacBook Pro, but I decided just recently to ditch it because I never use it and I'd like to reclaim the space. The official method of removing it with Boot Camp Assistant failed so I went the harder route involving booting into Internet Recovery mode and deleting the partitions manually, which worked and gave me the space back - except when I rebooted I got a Windows screen telling me booting failed, and when I hold down OPTION on a boot I still see \"Windows\" as an option. \nIf I pick OS X when I hold down OPTION it boots like I want it to but on a restart it still gave me the Windows error screen. Booting into Internet Recovery again and setting \"Macintosh HD\" as the Startup Disk seems to have fixed it and now on subsequent reboots I'm in OS X like I want again, but I can still see \"Windows\" as an option as I hold down OPTION on reboot. \nIs there any way to get rid of this \"ghost\" of Windows/Boot Camp on my system and if there's not, is this something I should be concerned with?\nThe long version\nSo here's the sequence of events:\n\n\n*\n\n*Got my rMBP in 10/2014\n\n*A few months later I added Boot Camp, initially with Windows 8.1 and later upgraded to Windows 10\n\n*The other day I decided to ditch Boot Camp as it's taking up space and I never use it. \n\n*Did a few different backups\n\n*Uninstalling Boot Camp via the Boot Camp Assistant didn't work, which is apparently really common\n\n*Read online that the next best thing is deleting the Boot Camp partitions directly and/or modifying them to appease Boot Camp Assistant\n\n*Tried removing the Boot Camp partition in Disk Utility. It wouldn't let me. (By the way, Disk Utility is really crappy and unusable in El Capitan - they've removed the old standard partitioning method and replaced them with a PIE CHART that doesn't work half the time)\n\n*Did lots of reading, a fair amount of panicking, and booted into Internet Recovery mode\n\n*Using the Disk Utility in Internet Recovery Mode (which is the old one from Mavericks/Yosemite, yay) I was able to do a series of maneuvers that, long story short, allowed me to delete the Boot Camp partition - along with a couple of others that, I'm guessing, are artifacts of Windows/Boot Camp - and got back to one big huge partition. I happily restarted...\n\n*...and was presented with a clearly-from-Microsoft screen (fonts, colors, etc.) saying Windows couldn't load. At this point I've got the \"No! We killed you!\" scene from Robocop going through my head\n\n*Reboot, hold down OPTION, and I see Macintosh HD and Windows. I pick Macintosh HD\n\n*OS X boots up, I have all my space back, life is wonderful\n\n*Reboot the Mac to see what happens and I'm back in Windows error land\n\n*Back in OS X (after rebooting and holding down OPTION again) I go to Startup Disk in System Preferences and try to set Macintosh HD as the start disk but it won't let me do anything because there's only one hard drive now and as far as it can tell it's already the startup disk\n\n*I booted the Mac into Internet Recovery mode and set the Startup Disk to Macintosh HD (since, I'm guessing, when you're in Internet Recovery mode you're booting off of the temporary-from-the-Internet disk) and restarted. \n\n*Mac restarts in OS X like I want it to\n\n*Reboot again, Mac still restarts in OS X like I want it to. Did this a few times to be sure.\n\n*Reboot again, hold down OPTION, I can still see Windows as an option but I don't know where it's coming from\n\n\nSo basically things are where I want them to - except there's this \"ghost\" of my Boot Camp install lingering. Is there any way to get rid of it? And failing that, can I just ignore it safely?\n\nA: You did a good job removing the Widows related partitions. I assume your Windows 10 was an EFI/GPT install, therefore you probably still have code left in the EFI partition (disk0s1).\nTo view the contents of this EFI partition you have to mount it. You can do so with the command shown below.\nsudo diskutil mount /dev/disk0s1\n\nBelow is a what I have in my EFI partition. I do not have any EFI dependent operating systems installed. If you have any folders that are Microsoft related, you can delete them. For example, the folder EFI/Microsoft.\n\nYou can also look for the folder EFI/BOOT. The apple firmware will recognize the file bootx64.efi in this folder as the default name for removable operating systems. You can delete this folder.\nWhen finished, unmount the EFI partition with the following command.\ndiskutil unmount /dev/disk0s1\n\n\nA: This worked a treat but for slow learners like myself it might be worth mentioning that after you mount EFI using the command window you then go to finder to look whats inside it and after deleting everything windows from EFI using finder you then return to the command line to unmount the EFI.

Removing them manually worked for me.  Look at camera roll \"usage\" number does not match photos in the app for a manual solution. \n", "Q: System Integrity Protection — Is it implemented in Darwin? Or is it OS X only? The question should be clear from the title. If System Integrity Protection, aka Rootless, is part of Darwin, then I might be interested in inspecting how it is implemented. I would be grateful if someone could point me to the relevant files or packages. I think it definitely should be in xnu, by the way, because it has to be in the kernel, but I'm also interested in how other packages interact with it, e.g., file_cmds.\nI guess this question can only be answered on Darwin 15.0.0's source code is released on https://opensource.apple.com/ (it's not yet available as of right now).\n\nA: SIP is exposed to the file handler code as a new \"restricted\" class flag ACL as if it were stored in the file system metadata, so the code required to prevent all writes would be fairly transparent to implement so that all other packages would just get an enoperm error if my suspicions are correct. \nYou are correct that we don't have a source dump yet for 10.11 so I reserve the right to be totally wrong about my suspicions. \n", "Q: Can't login in Mac App Store or iCloud - login loading forever After updating to latest developer release for OS X El Capitan, I can't login in Mac App Store or OS X iCloud settings. If I try incorrect password, a message is shown that the password is not correct. When I try my real password, the loading icon just spins forever. \nI already tried to remove Network settings plist file and some other things found on forums. System log file shows a lot of these few messages, especially when doing something with iCloud login. \nSOSAccountThisDeviceCanSyncWithCircle sync with device failure: Error Domain=com.apple.security.sos.error Code=1035 \"Account identity not set\"  \n\nand \n01/10/15 00:11:52,599 storeaccountd[591]: XPC error for connection com.apple.backupd.sandbox.xpc: Connection invalid  \n\nand\n01/10/15 00:11:52,931 sandboxd[226]: ([591]) storeaccountd(591) deny mach-lookup com.apple.backupd.sandbox.xpc\n\nUnfortunately I do not have backup of my previous installation. Also I can't update to latest El Capitan version, because App Store login is not working.\n\nA: NOTE: This solution is primarily meant for users of physical Apple devices, such as MacBooks, iMacs, Mac Pros, etc. While I will mention a link to a solution for virtual machine users as well, that is not the primary objective of this post. As such, that will not be posted here, for succinctness.\nAlso, while NVRAM (non-volatile RAM) does save certain settings and parameters for long-term, iCloud settings don't appear to be among the settings saved in NVRAM.\nThe solution will sound simple - but it's not. The full-out solution is a three-step process, which will force OS X to do the following: \n\n\n*\n\n*Wipe the existing, problematic settings file(s), and force OS X to reproduce valid ones in there place. \n\n*(Re)Start the iCloud service and/or its required related Daemons. \n\n*Validate/rewrite (hardware) machine details if required.\n\n\nWe’ll start by deleting the following file (admin permission required):\n/Library/Preferences/com.apple.apsd.plist\nWe’ll then ensure that the proper LaunchDaemons are running - in this case, Push Notifications. iCloud needs this running to operate. Enter the following into Terminal:\nsudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.apsd.plist\nFinally, please check to make sure that your OS X device has a (valid) Serial Number. Whether it’s real or virtual machine, the Serial must be less than 12 chars - otherwise, iCloud -based services like FaceTime and iMessage won’t be able to sign in (or will ‘hang-up’ at sign in attempt). Check this in your Mac’s ‘About’ section. If you have either a NULL or invalid Serial Number, please do one of the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Either use your Apple Care/Warranty to contact Apple. Have them set your hardware Serial Number, seeing that they were supposed to do this when they were done servicing your machine. \n\n\nOR\n\n\n*\n\n*Use the following application to change this (if you can't go to Apple for any reason, and aren't worried about voiding the device's warranty). Please do NOT use this tool if you have Apple Care or would like to preserve your Apple Warranty:\n\n\nBlank Board Serializer -\nDownloadable from here:\nhttp://rogersm.net/icloud-problems-mountain-lion-serial-number\n\nNow, for those of you using a virtual machine, please go here to complete the third step (Serial Number reset). You'll need to generate a valid, new Serial Number that is NOT currently in-use:\nhttp://www.insanelymac.com/forum/topic/292170-how-to-spoof-real-mac-in-vmware/\n\nThat should fix any issues with iCloud sign in and use of its related services for El Capitan. Works for most physical Mac OS X devices and VMware Workstation installations. \n\nA: It would appear from much research that iCloud, iMessage & FaceTime are inextricably linked & that to fix one, you need to 'fix' them all.\nWhat finally got me there was the Safe Mode boot followed by deleting /Library/Preferences/com.apple.apsd.plist\nNothing else worked.\nFar too much to post here, but see my answer to Messages won't let me sign in to iMessage & also the excellent post by Linc Davis at https://discussions.apple.com/thread/7272123\n\nA: As everyone else has mentioned, it's a problem with the serial number.  I also just encountered this, but on a virtual machine.  By default, Fusion gives it some extremely long serial number, which the App Store doesn't like.  To fix, edit the .vmx file and add the following line:\nSMBIOS.use12CharSerialNumber = \"TRUE\"\nHope this helps!\n\nA: I was suffering the same problem and someone on another site said that they solved their problem by quitting their VPN app, which I myself had running. Once I did that everything worked fine and I was able to sign into iCloud. \n\nA: I had the same problem yesterday and today.\nTurns out my macbook was lacking a serial number (no idea how it got deleted).\nI used the software Blank Board Serializer to write it anew and was able to log in.\nSo check your serial number.\n\nA: I had the same problem and that I was able to fix it.\nSelect [Apple] and \"This Mac\". If there is no serial number you need to restore it.\nFind the serial number on the chassis of your Mac.\nFind tool \"Blank Board Serializer\" somewhere in the Internet\nCreate a bootable disk or USB stick and use it.\nAfter entering the serial number, return is possibility of logging on to the App Store, iTunes Store, iCloud and iMessages\n\nA: I had the same problem and after searching the web for a while I found that I just had to logout and log back in from the Store menu.\n\nA: I found the solution\nI hope work on your mac \nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/ht204063 \nBye\n", "Q: As a merchant can I set up Apple Pay to link to multiple bank accounts? I haven't even attempted to set it up and admittedly don't know much about Apple Pay, but I assume that, as a merchant, when you first set it up you link it to a bank account, so that when people swipe their phones to pay, it will direct the funds to your merchant account.\nIs it possible to link more than one merchant account? For example, have it set up in a way that it automatically pays 5% to merchant account #1 and then the rest to merchant account #2?\n\nA: Apple Pay is a very different technology from something like Square, which would operate similarly to how you describe. You sign up as a merchant with Square and link it to your bank account.\nIn this situation, Square is the point-of-sale, acquirer, and merchant account all in one. And as a matter of fact, they support using Apple Pay at the payment terminal.\nIn a more traditional merchant situation, you have a merchant bank, which will put you on a specific processor platform, as dictated by the needs of your payment gateway and point of sale. As a merchant, you don't have any interaction with Apple at all; if you want to accept Apple Pay, you just need to make sure that your point of sale is capable of accepting NFC payments, and that this is all supported by your gateway and platform. Typically, though, you will only be interacting with your merchant bank, and they will be able to facilitate the set up of an Apple Pay-compatible POS.\nSo, this means that typically the funds will all be deposited into the merchant account that is linked to that point of sale. You could probably have your merchant bank set up deposits to your business checking accounts in percentages as you suggest, but there is typically a 1:1 relationship between Point-of-Sale or Payment Gateway and your merchant account.\n", "Q: Issue with creating a symbolic link inside /System folder I am trying to make a symbolic link inside the /System folder and even if I run the command as su I get the following error message.\nmacbook-pro:~ root# cd /System/Library/Perl/Extras/5.18 \nmacbook-pro:5.12 root# ln -s /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Library/Perl/5.18/darwin-thread-multi-2level/SVN/ SVN \nln: SVN: Operation not permitted\nmacbook-pro:5.12 root# ls -ld /System\ndrwxr-xr-x@  4 root  wheel restricted 136 Sep 22 10:37 System\n\nHow can I get this working?\n\nA: I am guessing you are doing this to get git-svn to work.

Every time when I try to login on my account I have a crash as following:\n\nIs there a way to reset this and download again? \nI am really appreciate for any help. I do not know what to do.\n\nA: Yes - this is generally an easy recovery - the next step is to get a backup (which will be a pain if you don't have one) and then perform an erase install.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/kb/PH21973\nThat part should go easily. If that fails, you likely have a hardware error that would need to be addressed. Also, if you haven't tried disconnecting everything from the MacBook that you can except power. No USB, no ethernet, no thunderbolt, no SD cards, etc...\n\nA: Had the same problem with my MacBook Air 11\" 2013 model. None of the provided solutions worked for me. I also tried to reinstall El Capitan by booting into recovery mode. I reinstalled it two times but the error kept showing up.  \nSo here's how I solved the problem:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your mac.\n\n*Boot into safe mode (Hold shift while booting up). Hint: During the screen with the Apple logo and the progress bar, nothing will look different, but at the login window, there should be \"SAFE BOOT\" on the top right corner of the screen to confirm that you are in safe mode\n\n*Log in again. This time it should work, if it doesn't go to step 1 again.\n\n*Finish up the installation process.\n\n*Backed my data up\n\n*Fresh reinstall\n\n\nA: I did it with simply press Cmd + R, and then press off. Cmd + R I kept pressed until Apple logo appeared, then I get into Install OS X mode. There you should once again connect to the internet, choose language,and waiting for new install.\n\nA: I got the same error and contacted apple support. They walked me through the steps to reinstall OS X which will take several hours. Fortunately I have a time machine back-up that I can use once complete\n\nA: I had this error as well. But I found restoring from Time Machine troublesome, as the Setup and Migration Assistants both refused to restore data from the TM backup, reporting there wasn't enough space in an 890GB OS X partition to store 400GB of data.\nWhen I next attempt to install El Capitan, I'm going to create a bootable clone of the boot drive using Carbon Copy Cloner, so I can restore from that if needed.\nBut before that, I'm going to run Apple Hardware Diagnostics to check for hardware issues.\n\nA: Fixed!  Had the same problem with late 2011 MBP--reinstalled El OS three times, still crashed on first login attempt. The problem I think resides with the new System Integrity Protection (SIP). You can't repair permissions anymore, and any offending files in the system folder will cause problems. I pulled the drive, attached to another Mac, and using EasyFind, searched for Extensions folders, sorted on date, and removed old plist files (most were from the same 2015 date and from Apple). For good measure, I also searched for StartupItem folders and removed anything that looked fishy (sorry, I tried so many different things that failed before this that I can't remember exactly). \n\nA: I couldn't find the sxuptp.kexp file, but I compared the list of *.kexp files in the crash log file under folder /Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports and all the kexp files in /System/Library/Extensions/ . The last kexp file in the crash log is com.apple.iokit.IOACPIFamily or correspondingly IOACPIFamily.kexp. I looked into the folder /System/Library/Extensions/ and find that the next file after IOACPIFamily.kexp is LivescribeSmartpen.kext. If you heard of the smartpen, you will know. I moved it to the desktop (or any other place). This fixed the problem.

Is it true? If so, what problem has Apple with this license? There isn't any other GPLv3'd software in OSX?\n\nA: *\n\n*Yes, newer versions of Bash are released under GPLv3\n\n*This question brings out armchair lawyers that argue points for and against GPLv3. Simply put, GPLv3 conflicts with Apple's Licensing Policies (among other licenses). None of these licenses prevent you from downloading the source code and compiling a newer version of Bash.

The new update seems pretty legit, so I am considering updating my macbook. \nI have Parallels installed on my computer, and I don't want it to be removed or damaged during the installation of El Capitan.\nIf I use time machine to back up my macbook, will it back up everything and keep Parallels and the files on it safe? Or, will it only store original Mac files, ignoring parallels?\n\nA: If you haven't set Time Machine to exclude any files from the backup, you should be fine.\nIf you want to be really cautious, you can find the Parallels virtual machine file and manually copy it onto your external hard drive, free space permitting. Put it at the top level of the drive, not in the Backups.backupdb folder.\nThis will keep your files safe on your external hard drive no matter what happens on your computer. To make sure you can keep actually using Parallels, though, you'll need to make sure you're on Parallels version 10 or 11.

It doesn't show anything, not even the boot options.\nWhen I try the old disk it boots just fine.  \nDo you have any idea what I'm doing wrong?\n\nA: To be able to create a bootable volume for Intel Macs you have to use the GUID partition scheme while partitioning a disk in Disk Utility. Apple Partition Table (APT) is for older non-Intel Macs or non-bootable disks in both worlds. The disk size is restricted to 2 TB though.\nIf no boot option works (C or alt/option) either your optical drive is broken (or dusted etc.) or the DVDs got corrupted.\nThen re-attach the 250 GB disk and an additional thumb drive, download an OS X installer app of your choice and create a bootable OS X installer thumb drive.\nPut the 500 GB disk back into your MacBook again and boot from the thumb drive.\n", "Q: Kernel panic after installing El Capitan I've upgraded from El Capitan GM to Release today.\nAfter the installer app has moved the install files, the mac tried to reboot but the screen stayed black. I shut it off using the power button and restarted it getting kernel panics every time:\nProcess 1 exec of /sbin/launchd failed, errno2\"@/Library/Caches/com.apple.xbs/Sources/xnu/xnu\"\n\nI tried booting in safe mode without any luck.\nSo I thought that this could have happened because of any faulty kexts. I booted in Recovery mode, used Disk utility to unlock my Macintosh HD, and navigated with the finder to \"/Volumes/Macintosh HD/\".\nThe strange thing is that there is no Library or System folder. I can only find these folders under /Volumes/Macintosh HD/Recovered Items/.\nSo I followed some advices from Apple support forums and deleted the folder /Volumes/Macintosh HD/Recovered Items/Library/Application Support/Virtual Box/\". I also moved the kext file from Little Snitch to a newly created folder \"Unsupported\" to ensure that LS is not the case of the problem.\nBut nothing helped. Still getting the same kernel panic. What can I do?\n\nA: Same here, booted into recovery and back to yosemite\ncmd-shift-r keys down while booting\nI guess 3 of 4 updates have failed for me last few years, getting tired of osx OS updates. Usually installs after a few attempts with startup utilities.\nBetter make a time machine backup before you try installation.\n", "Q: Can I use an iPhone 6s in Sri Lanka if I purchase it in Dubai? I am going to purchase an Apple iPhone 6s 16GB from Dubai. And I'll use it in Sri Lanka. The carrier I'm going to use is 'Dialog' in Sri Lanka. They has 4G LTE(band 3-1800MHz). There are variations in iPhone models. And also I've heard that there are locked and unlocked iPhones. This is really confusing for me. These are my questions:\n\nWhat variation should I buy(which works in Sri Lanka)?\n\nUnlocked or Locked one?\n\nA: If you buy a LOCKED phone, you can only use it with the carrier to which it is locked. An UNLOCKED phone is usable on any carrier in any country, assuming it uses the same frequency bands. You would need to purchase a local SIM card for every network on which you need to use the phone.\nFortunately the iPhone 6s supports more bands than almost any other phone, so it should work in almost every country.\nFor this flexibility, there is a price - an unlocked phone is usually much more expensive than a locked phone. But for the ability to use it anywhere in the world, that additional price might be worth it.\n\nA: unlocked one should be used as a locked one is carrier specific\n", "Q: Mail.app won't open Since I installed El Capitan, I have been completely unable to open Mail.app. I've removed all my email accounts, I've removed all the file in the MailData folder (even the Accounts.plist) file. Nothing works.

Removing the files in /Library/Mail/Bundles fixed it for me.\n", "Q: How can I prevent the Photos app from launching when I connect a device? The title says it all, whenever I plug a memory card on my computer or a cable to a device with photos, the Photos app launches.\nI don't like using this app, not because I don't think it's a good app or whatever, but because I usually like making sure that I transfer all the files to the destination folders, not just the picture files (so also folder structure, preview files, .THM etc).\nHow can I disable the auto-launching of the Photos app?\n\nA: I'm not exactly certain how I managed it, but a combination of these may be at least part of the fix...\n\n\n*\n\n*In Image Capture, set \"connecting this xxx opens\" to 'no application'\n(If you don't see that option, click the tiny reveal button at the bottom left)\n\n\n\n\n\n*Using RCDefaultApp to set all Media options to 'Ignore'\n\n\n\n\nA: You can turn this off in the Photos app. \n\n\n*\n\n*Connect the device\n\n*In the Photos app go to the Import tab\n\n*Uncheck the Open Photos for this device checkbox\n\n\n\nIt seems, you have to do this for each device individually.

Is it possible - without any command line or programming being involved - to remove all folders within a folder, and just leave the files?\nFor example, if I processed this photo folder:\n\nThen I would end up having all the photos in just one folder to go through them faster rather than having to go inside each folder (some of which are sometimes empty, since the camera creates the folder based on the date but doesn't delete the folder if you delete the photos from that day).\nI know that one can change the camera's settings to make the camera save all the photos in just one folder, but this isn't what I'm asking, since knowing how to do this type of de-folderizing action would be useful in many other situations, not just with this particular example.\nSimplest solutions are more welcome than ones involving programming.\n\nA: Currently I'm sitting at an older Mac (running 10.6.8), but if I use the folder view where I see the sidebar and search field I can:\n\n\n*\n\n*Type anything into the search field to activate it\n\n*Constrain the search to the enclosing folder\n\n*Click the little circle with the plus to get more search options\n\n*Choose \"Kind\" is \"Document\"\n\n*Delete the text you typed in to activate the search field\nWhat I get is a list of all documents in all the folders inside the enclosing folder, recursively. You could then select all of the files and copy or move them to a new location.\nOr -- since we are talking about Photographs -- if your have Adobe Bridge you can set that to show the contents of sub-folders when looking at a folder, then use Bridge's move or copy commands.\n", "Q: Can I delete /Library/SystemMigration Can I delete /Library/SystemMigration after my upgrade to 10.11. I think, there is nothing, that I want to save.\n\nA: You can delete this folder.\nThis directory is a backup of shared caches (relevant to application launches) of the old system. \nI saved ~ 600 MB from this.\n\nA: SIP - Enabled\nI was able to delete the contents of /Library/SystemMigration/History with enabled SIP by first changing the permissions (CMD-I) and then just removing the folder (~600MB) inside the History folder.\nOS X 10.11.6\n\nA: Don't delete this folder! It's doing something important, because when I tried to delete it I saw a message that the files and folders are in use. \n", "Q: Changes to Terminal in El Capitan Can someone please describe the changes made to Terminal.app in El Capitan? I've just noticed that mouse events started working in Tmux, which is awesome!\nI had the following set in my tmux.conf:\nsetw -g mode-mouse on\nset -g mouse-select-pane on\nset -g mouse-resize-pane on\nset -g mouse-select-window on\n\nwhich did not work because Terminal prior to OS X 10.11 did not pass mouse events to underlying processes. Now it wonderfully works. What other changes are included in new Terminal?\n\nA: The command lines are now marked with square brackets as in the screen snippet below.\n\n\nA: The new Marks feature in El Capitan 10.11 Terminal adds structure to the terminal contents by marking prompt lines and other interesting content, enabling operations like navigating, selecting, Copying, Printing and deleting commands or their output.\nSee the Edit menu, especially the Marks, Bookmarks, and Navigation submenus for Marks-related commands.\nMarks are indicated with “square brackets” at either end of a marked line. Bookmarks are a more heavyweight mark—they're used for marking sections with a time stamp or a custom name—and are indicated with thicker vertical lines and a different background color.\nYou can hide the mark indicators if you don't want to see them, with the View > Hide/Show Marks menu item. This doesn't remove marks or prevent the Marks-related commands from working.\nA good explanation of what you can do with Marks and the related commands is found in this answer to this question.\n", "Q: Split Screen with certain applications: Does it only work on the primary display? I'm running El Capitan with two displays. \nI am trying split screen and it works fine for all applications on the primary screen (when enabling that each screen has their own spaces), but for some applications it doesn't work on my secondary display.\nFor instance, when trying to add iTunes and Mail to the same split screen, the cursor turns into a white circle with an 'X' in the middle, and they won't join up in the same screen.\nIs this expected behaviour?\nPrimary screen: External 27'' HP display.\nSecondary screen: 15'' internal retina display.\n\nA: It works fine in both my displays.\nWhat happens if you try to move a split screen from your primary display to your secondary display?\n", "Q: Copy to clipboard from Tmux in El Capitan I am quite happy with the Terminal changes in El Capitan (see e.g. this question).\nHowever, i can't figure out how to enable copying to system clipboard from within Tmux. For instance, now that I am able to select text within Tmux properly by mouse, how can i copy selected text to clipboard as well, in addition to Tmux's own buffer?\nI have the following in my tmux.conf:\nsetw -g mode-mouse on\nset -g mouse-select-pane on\nset -g mouse-resize-pane on\nset -g mouse-select-window on\n\nsetw -g mode-keys vi\nbind-key -t vi-copy 'v' begin-selection\nbind-key -t vi-copy 'y' copy-selection\n\nI tried modifying the last line to\nbind-key -t vi-copy 'y' copy-selection \\; copy-pipe \"pbcopy\"\n\nbut it didn't really work. Would be grateful for suggestions!\nThanks!\n\nA: Using tmux version 2.2 or later add the following to your tmux.conf file:\nbind-key -t emacs-copy MouseDragEnd1Pane copy-pipe \"pbcopy\"\nbind-key -t vi-copy MouseDragEnd1Pane copy-pipe \"pbcopy\"\n\n\nA: The answer of @Oplatek take effect\n\nIn default Terminal application go to View->\"Allow mouse reporting\" and uncheck it.\n\nBut by this way, we would not be able to scroll the screen by mouse.\nHere's another way without disable Allow mouse reporting:\nPress Fn and select the text by mouse. It keeps the selection there so you can right click and select copy.\n\nA: Actually, I just find out very simple solution how to enable copying using Cmd+C again. \nIn default Terminal application go to View->\"Allow mouse reporting\" and uncheck it. Thats it.\nPS: Obviously, the new nice features like dragging split screen in tmux stop working after unchecking the mouse reporting.\n\nA: If you use iTerm2 3.x, you can make copy / paste work by enabling Applications in terminal may access clipboard:\n\nJust highlight text with your mouse to copy it into the OS X clipboard!\nYou can also paste from the OS X clipboard into tmux with the usual Cmd + V.\n\nA: If you hold the function key down you can select and copy to clipboard with apple+c as well.\n\nA: Actually, i was wrong when stating that copy-pipe does not work. It does, and copy-selection is then superfluous, as copy-pipe both copies text to Tmux pasteboard and pipes to an arbitrary shell command. So the following line works:\nbind-key -t vi-copy 'y' copy-pipe \"pbcopy\"\n\nHowever, one needs to press y before releasing the mouse button. I've stumbled across this in the documentation for tmux-yank plugin:\n\"When making a selection using tmux mode-mouse on or mode-mouse copy-mode,   you cannot rely on the default 'release mouse after selection to copy' behavior. Instead, press y before releasing mouse.\"\nSo it works, but with somewhat annoying need to press y in order to copy mouse-selected text.\n\nA: Using tmux 2.2, OS X El Capitan, Terminal Version 2.6.1 (the default that ships with El Capitan), the following setup works flawless (so far).\n$ cat ~/.tmux.conf\nset -g mouse on\nbind-key -t emacs-copy MouseDragEnd1Pane copy-pipe \"pbcopy\"\nbind-key -t vi-copy MouseDragEnd1Pane copy-pipe \"pbcopy\"\n\nTo copy, press the left mouse button, mark the text, and let go.

It used to be there, but was removed in Yosemite. The only workaround is to press Ctrl-Fn-F2 (or Ctrl-F2 if you inverted the Fn key) to immediately show and activate the menu bar. You can then navigate by keyboard or click items with the cursor.\n", "Q: El Capitan: Appstore says \"downloaded\" and \"there's been an error\" (stuck) In order to download El Capitan, I clicked the \"download\" button in the highlighted banner of the Appstore. The \"busy\" wheel began to spin in the upper left, and I thought to give it some time.\nAfter a while (and rebooting) I noticed not much happened. When I took a look at the detail page of El Capitan on the Appstore, the download button was greyed out (saying \"downloaded\"), but on its left it says \"there's been an error'.\nNow I'm not sure if it's actually downloaded (rebooted to no avail) or that I have to go through the process again. Eitherway I'm stuk because of the greyed out button (I can't do anything). Is there a way to find out if there's actually an install package downloaded on my system (and if so: where can I find it?), or could this be an issue with the Appstore itself? I must say I'm downloading the package on another mac without any problem…\n\nA: Apparently it downloaded the OS X El Capitan installation (under that name, or Install OS X El Capitan) in the Applications folder, which seems to be the download location. I could launch it from there. \nProblem solved…\nUPDATE: if this would occur during you Mac OSX Sierra download, the file you'd be looking for is \"(Install) macOS Sierra\" in the Applications folder.\n\nA: me too. On my 2009 iMac, found it under Install OS X El Capitan in the Applications folder.

Is there a way around this?\n\nA: It depends on how you have the global pref & also the prefs in each app...\nBear in mind there are 2 ways to trigger it - whether you have \"Correct spelling automatically\" set or not\nOf course, you need Text replacement on, in for instance, Safari > Edit > Substitutions\n\nbut then if you also have\nEdit Menu > Spelling & Grammar > Check Spelling While Typing and also Check Spelling Automatically  \n\nthen as you start to type a substitution, it will first auto-suggest underneath\n\nAs soon as it auto-suggests, you have 2 options...  \n\n\n*\n\n*Hit  Enter ⌅  & it will auto-fill & add a space, or  \n\n*Hit  ↓  then  Enter ⌅  & it will not leave a space\n\n\nThe real down-side of having it set like this is if you're not expecting it to correct something & it does, without you noticing.\nAny slightly unusual word or spelling can get auto-corrected to a simpler... yet wrong one, if you don't proof-read.  \nYour friend Anny quickly becomes Any, for instance\n\n", "Q: .xls file attachments in Gmail opens, by default, with Numbers I am using latest version of OS X, whenever I want to download an .xls file from email attachment, it opens, by default, with Numbers and the file is not downloaded on my machine.

This is standard OS X behaviour. You can change the default App to open the .xls file as @IronCraftman describes in his answer. To only download the file and not open it (hover over the attachment icon) and right click and select \"Download Linked File (As)\" It wil download to the default (Downloads) folder. But won't open the associated App for the filetype.

The --noprofile option may be used to inhibit this behavior. When invoked as an interactive shell with the name sh, Bash looks for the variable ENV, expands its value if it is defined, and uses the expanded value as the name of a file to read and execute. Since a shell invoked as sh does not attempt to read and execute commands from any other startup files, the --rcfile option has no effect. A non-interactive shell invoked with the name sh does not attempt to read any other startup files. \n\nOf you want bash running as sh to use ~/.profile when not a login shell (e.g. keep current environment) use\nenv ENV=$HOME/.profile /bin/sh\n\n", "Q: Will Mac Mini work with Dell Inspiron Laptop I am interested in buying the new Mac Mini as I cannot afford a Mac book or Air.

Is there a way to make these keys work, do services repair them or should I rather buy a new one?\n\nA: I'd be surprised if normal wear & tear would be able to do that in just 30 months or so. I only retired my similar keyboard after about 7 years, when I could no longer read the letters, I'd worn them off.\nI'd try tapping the offending keys with greater than usual force, see if something crispy is stuck underneath. After that, I've heard of people having success actually running keyboards under the tap - so long as they are given plenty of time to thoroughly dry out afterwards, though I've never done it myself.\nWouldn't try it with a wireless keyboard, but wired might just be fine.\nLate, late edit\nAfter giving one of those keyboards a drink of water accidentally, I wouldn't recommend it as a cleaning method.

It seems to be adjusting the gamma and the grays instead of the backlight brightness.\nWhat's going on here and is it possible to restore the behavior of Yosemite and earlier with this option?\n\nA sample of the gamma difference with setting enabled/disabled.\n\n\nA: The solution, posted as a comment by user Nicnl, is as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disable SIP: \n\n\n*\n\n*Reboot into Recovery Mode (hold down ⌘R on startup).\n\n*Open Terminal and enter the following command\n\ncsrutil disable\n\n*Reboot back into macOS.\n\n\n*Open Terminal and type in the following:\ncd /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/AmbientDisplay.framework/Versions/A/XPCServices/com.apple.AmbientDisplayAgent.xpc/Contents/MacOS/\nmv com.apple.AmbientDisplayAgent _com.apple.AmbientDisplayAgent\nThe first command just changes the directory you are in, while the second one renames the file to something macOS can’t find.\n\n*Enable SIP\n\n\n*\n\n*Reboot into Recovery Mode (hold down ⌘R on startup).\n\n*Open Terminal and enter the following command\n\ncsrutil enable\n\n*Reboot back into macOS.\n\n\n\nTaken from here.\n\nA: It is a new feature called ‘Ambient light compensation’. Before the Beta 7 or so it was a separate option in that menu on your screenshots, but in newer betas and in the finale release Apple merged it with the ‘Automatically adjust brightness’ checkbox, so yes, it is now adjusting not only backlight brightness, but gamma as well.\nThe only solution I found so far is to turn off that checkbox and adjust backlight brightness manually, which isn't a solution really. Hope Apple will bring back a separate checkbox for ambient light compensation.\n\nA: Have you explored the ambient light sensor in the display next to the iSight camera? You can shade it, shine a light in it and clean the surface of the glass.\nIf it's not an environmental change, you might want to disable that option and reach out to Apple Support to see if it's a bug in this build or if you coincidentally have a hardware failure at the same time as you did the software upgrade. It's clearly not likely, but it's possible.\n", "Q: Unwanted network disk mounts El Capitan has brought back a problem that I had with Yosemite at first - it disappeared after a later OS update.\nI have a headless MacMini on my home network, with a daisy chain of firewire disks attached to it. I use them for backing up photographs and movies (~3TB worth), and the MacMini runs CCC to keep all disks synced. The two disks I use most often have aliases in my dock so I can access them easily.\nAfter the 10.11 upgrade they keep mounting spontaneously on my desktop.\nThey are not among my login items. I have cleared the Recent Items from the Apple menu, and have cleared Recent Servers from the Finder/Go/Connect to Server... menu. Directory Utility shows no mounts. I have disabled the Guest account as I had read it can cause unwanted connections. \nThe one clue I have is that I can dismount the two disks, but they will remount on opening some apps like Preview or TextEdit - perhaps something to do with their open dialog looking for files to open? I have no files on either disk that they have ever opened or saved to those disks.\nUsing Main Menu Pro I have cleaned the system cache, all user caches, font cache, DNS cache and all logs. I'd do it all again with Onyx, but it hasn't been updated for 10.11 yet. The disks still keep mounting!\nBTW, today I updated another mac at home and it has started automounting just one of those two disks - the only one of the two that it has ever mounted. I'm missing something - any ideas what it might be?\n\nA: Further to my automounting network disk woes:\nZapping PRAM doesn't work either, nor does playing with what shows in the sidebar of Finder windows among the Bonjour, Connected Server, and Shared sections of Finder prefs, but.....\nI might have just found the answer, and it's weird. I had noticed that opening Preview or TextEdit would always mount these network disks, and those two apps, in Apple's infinite wisdom, start up with an Open... dialog set to one's Documents folder. I had made aliases of the two disks and placed those aliases in my Documents folder. By dragging them to my Dock I had a clickable icon for each that showed them to be network disks (just dragging the icon of the mounted disk directly to the Dock shows them with a generic folder icon). I wondered if the Open dialog of Preview was mounting the disks as part of showing what was available in Documents for it to open, so I dragged the aliases onto the Desktop. The disks still mounted, so I tried a restart to see if Preview would still do it. It did. So then I cleared the System cache, all user caches and restarted again. This time the disks didn't mount! Being either brave or foolish, I dragged the aliases back into the Documents folder, and they still don't mount on opening Preview! I have restarted since just to see if they would reappear on opening Preview, but they don't. It's odd how this has happened immediately on upgrade to 10.10 and again with 10.11. With 10.10 it went away with a 10.10.x upgrade, but this time I may have solved it\n", "Q: Photos app wants to upload my library to iCloud once again After I upgraded to OS X EL Capitan, I need to turn iCloud Photo Library once again on my Macbook Pro, but once I tap on iCloud Photo library checkbox the Photos a[[ wants to upload my images once again.

According to Apple's Documentation, for certain operations, the user must be physically present.  However, I am trying to administer a Xcode Server build box via Screen Sharing, and I can't add or remove keychain items because of this restriction. This server is inside of our corporate firewall.

I really need them in iCloud also.\nNOTE\nI know that I can create another albums with specific faces, but it is not expected.\n\nA: Unfortunately faces are not synched across devices using iCloud Photo Library.\nThere is evidence that Faces data is stored in Apple servers somewhere since you can ask Siri to show you pictures of a specific person from a different device that uses the same iCloud photo library. There is a reddit thread on this topic here:  https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/3ggvn3/icloud_photo_library_and_faces/.\nMy guess is that Apple is still grappling with how to create a consolidated view of your contacts across devices and photos. \nPlease request that Apple prioritize fully implementing face syncing across devices:  http://www.apple.com/feedback/photos.html.\n", "Q: Is there a way to bring back the full status bar in Safari 9? Contrary to what Apple (or a Google search) seems to think, I don't want a more minimal status bar—I want one that stays in place, is the same height and width at all times, and doesn't distract me by flashing in and out.  Much like I've had through all of Safari's existence up until now.\nNow it's changed, and I can't find a setting to move it back.  Is there another option (perhaps via Terminal magic) that can unlock a more \"classic\" feel to the status bar?\n\nA: So let's go through the options here:\n\n\n*\n\n*defaults write com.apple.Safari ShowStatusBar -boolean true\n\n\n*\n\n*No effect.\n\n\n*Minimal status bar extension\n\n\n*\n\n*It auto hides.\n\n\n*Ultimate status bar extension\n\n\n*\n\n*Yup, auto hides too.\n\n\n*Statusbar-lite\n\n\n*\n\n*Guess what? :/\n\n\n\nWhile searching around though, I found a great deal of people asking how they force the bar to autohide. It's a common complaint in editorials as well, and seems to be the one constant of all the Safari extensions.\nAfter an extensive search - what you're looking for does not exist at this time :(\nHardly the first time Apple has taken away control from a user, either...\nTl;dr: Apologies, but it's time to let it go - it's gone.\n\nHOWEVER....\nOne of the extensions I found is open source and appears to be easily editable. Specifically, this one, and by removing a line of JS, I can force the bar to stay on the screen, and replace it with blank text (so it looks correctly).\nHere's the thing, it's still just an overlay on top of the page, it's not a part of the safari \"window\" as the old status bar could be, and doesn't show all of the same information either.\nHere's what the effect looks like\nAnd here's the extension package.

From the look of it, Mail is crashing because I don't have an account. That makes no sense. If I don't have an account, there shouldn't be activity, right? \nHow can I fix this, besides creating an account? \n\nA: Started as a comment, but got too long. You are asking two questions. The \"spinning beach ball of death\" and the crashing MailServiceAgent are most likely unrelated.\nTo clarify. The \"spinning beach ball of death\" doesn't actually indicate that anything is crashing. It indicates that an application (most of the time, temporarily) is not responding to messages from the operating system.\nFrom Apple's Human Interface Guidelines:\n\nThe spinning wait cursor is also standard, but it is displayed\n  automatically by the window server when an app can't handle all of the\n  events it receives. In general, if an app doesn’t respond for a few\n  moments, the spinning wait cursor appears. If the app continues to be\n  unresponsive, users often react by force-quitting it.\n\nIf you move the cursor around, does the wait cursor still appear if it is over another application or over your desktop? If you ALT+TAB to bring another application to the foreground do you still get the wait cursor? If it only appears over one application then that application alone is having an issue. If it appears over all applications or if you find you are unable to move the cursor or to ALT+TAB to another application then you have a wider system problem rather than a problem with one specific application.\n\nA: What's going on will be hard to diagnose without your Mail settings.\nAre you looking for options how to get that file read from Apple or do you want some ideas to narrow it down to one Mail account or a specific action?\nOne thing to observe is the SPOD has nothing to do with a single thread crash. The Mail app is able to crash 10 times a minute and not block the UI (I know as I've had that happen during the betas) and something else is to cause for the system slowness.\nHere's what I would do:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make a paper note of each time the Mac SPOD and press the sys diagnose key (Shift+Ctrl+Opt+Cmd+.) each time it happens. (This will make things even slower, but you will have two pieces of critical data - a saved collection of the recent log files and system diagnosis information coupled with your paper notes of what you were trying to do when the system hung up.\n\n*Open Internet Accounts preference pane and remove all accounts from there. iCloud can have mail accounts and that setup information gets injected into Mail (well mail reads the common settings to be precise). Mail accounts clearly affect mail - so delete them as well.\n\n*Once you know what triggers the event - make a new user account and try to trigger it there.\n\n*Once you have 10 sysdiagnose files, you have enough data to open an AppleCare support ticket and get engineering attention to look into the issue. Any less data and you likely get told to monitor things and report back when you can reproduce the crash.\n\n\nAlso, OS X is more complicated than before. If you have a user on the Mac - some user processes start even before you log in. The OS also will run threads for programs that are not running and close programs that it shows as running and kill/sleep threads on programs that are still running. the days of having a simple I'm running an app so there are threads running is over (sadly?). Mail is one program that has been converted in to many background processes and inter process communications which makes debugging it all the more hard.\n", "Q: How do I disable System Integrity Protection (SIP) AKA \"rootless\" on macOS? Apple has introduced System Integrity Protection, also known as \"rootless\", with OS X 10.11, El Capitan. I understand this is a step for general protection against malware but as a developer I need write access to some of the files it locks away.\nHow do I disable this protection?\n\nA: It would be safer to modify /etc/paths so that /usr/local/bin is merely before usr/bin. That way you can do your development work within /usr/local/bin without having to disable SIP.\nClean installations of the OS have ordered /etc/paths this way since El Capitan, but if you were upgrading the OS from Yosemite or earlier, you'd have to modify the path order manually.\n\nA: If all you need is to access /usr/local, take a look at this page: http://web.archive.org/web/20160117204214/https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/blob/master/share/doc/homebrew/El_Capitan_and_Homebrew.md\nThe idea is to temporarily disable SIP using csrutil disable, add /usr/local, use chflags to set that directory to non-restricted\n sudo mkdir /usr/local && sudo chflags norestricted /usr/local && sudo chown -R $(whoami):admin /usr/local\n\nand then re-enable SIP using csrutil enable.\nIf /usr/local already exists at the time of your upgrade, then even the above isn't necessary. You can simply run\nsudo chown -R $(whoami):admin /usr/local\n\n\nA: If you can't get into Recovery Partition to run csrutil disable (to disable SIP), try setting boot args with nvram command, e.g.\nsudo nvram boot-args=\"rootless=0\"\n\nHowever, if you've got the following error:\n\nnvram: Error setting variable - 'boot-args': (iokit/common) not permitted\n\nthen it won't work. You still need to boot it recovery/safe mode.\nSee:\n\n\n*\n\n*Setting a NVRAM variable in normal boot not permitted but allowed in recovery mode\n\n*Restarting in safe mode without using the shift key under Mojave\n\nA: Note: disabling System Integrity Protection is dangerous, and makes your system more vulnerable to malware.\nAs Apple puts it in the developer documentation about SIP:\n\nWarning\nDisable SIP only temporarily to perform necessary tasks, and reenable it as soon as possible. Failure to reenable SIP when you are done testing leaves your computer vulnerable to malicious code.\n\nIf you are simply trying to configure system development tools such as vim, python2, ruby and so on, you almost certainly want to be just installing community-maintained versions from Homebrew and configuring those instead.  The system-provided tools may be convenient to bootstrap, but if you require SIP exceptions for your daily workflow you are almost certainly doing things in a way which will break in a future version of the operating system, and may break applications and other system functionality in the meanwhile.\nValid reasons to disable SIP yourself might be:\n\n*\n\n*if you're doing research on malware yourself in a disposable environment, such as in a macOS virtual machine\n\n*if you are attempting to modify core operating system functionality for deployment in a highly-specialized environment such as a public-facing kiosk\n\n*if you require a legacy kernel extension such as MacFUSE on an M1 mac\n\nAlso important beyond the security implications is the fact that anything you do on a mac with SIP disabled will not work on anyone else's mac unless they also disable it first. If you're developing mac apps, then your system becomes less useful as a testbed because you don't know if your code only works because you hacked your system. If you're developing for another platform such as deployment to a web server, then you can't share your development environment setup with other developers on your team without compromising their security as well.\nHere's how to do it if you really need to:\nApple's documentation covers disabling SIP, About System Integrity Protection on your Mac and Configuring System Integrity Protection.\nAn article on lifehacker.com lists these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Reboot your Mac into Recovery Mode by restarting your computer and holding down Command+R until the Apple logo appears on your screen.\n\n*Click Utilities > Terminal.\n\n*In the Terminal window, type in csrutil disable and press Enter.\n\n*Restart your Mac.\n\n\nYou can verify whether a file or folder is restricted by issuing this ls command using the capital O (and not zero 0) to modify the long listing flag:\nls -lO /System /usr \n\nLook for the restricted text to indicate where SIP is enforced.\nBy default (=SIP enabled), the following folders are restricted (see Apple Support page):\n/System\n/usr\n/bin\n/sbin\nApps that are pre-installed with OS X\n\n... and the following folders are free:\n/Applications\n/Library\n/usr/local\n\n\nA: If the goal is to really just disable System Integrity Protection then booting into the Recovery HD partition as previously recommended in the other answers here via Command+r on boot is not the fastest way to do this.\nYou can combine single user mode boot with recovery HD boot in an undocumented startup key combination:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204904 covers normal recovery \n\n*hold Command+r+s to boot into Single User Recovery Mode. \n\n\nThis gets you just into the bare minimum environment that is needed for this directly.\n\nA: It's possible to disable SIP by booting to Recovery HD and running the following command:\ncsrutil disable\n\n\nIt is also possible to enable SIP protections and selectively disable aspects of it, by adding one or more flags to the csrutil enable command. All require being booted from Recovery in order to set them:\nEnable SIP and allow installation of unsigned kernel extensions\ncsrutil enable --without kext\n\n\nEnable SIP and disable filesystem protections\ncsrutil enable --without fs\n\n\nEnable SIP and disable debugging restrictions\ncsrutil enable --without debug\n\n\nEnable SIP and disable DTrace restrictions\ncsrutil enable --without dtrace\n\n\nEnable SIP and disable restrictions on writing to NVRAM\ncsrutil enable --without nvram\n\n\nI also have a post available with more information about SIP:\nSystem Integrity Protection – Adding another layer to Apple’s security model\n", "Q: If I pause an App Store update, and shut off my Mac, will it resume upon startup?

Whenever I attempt to start a VPN Connection with Junos Pulse (Version 5.0.11) on El Capitan it freezes midway through connecting and my login keychain becomes inaccessible to any other apps. The only way I've found to restore my keychain and restart Pulse is to restart. Killing Junos Pulse and the PulseTray processes in Activity Monitor seems to have no effect.\n\nA: So far the only workaround I've found is to remove the connection profile in Junos Pulse and re-add it, which avoids any attempt to access the keychain.

I created two photo books on one Mac, but that Mac is getting a little constrained on space (this has now actually become more important, because I can not update to El Capitan because there is not enough space). Eventhough I've set Photos to \"optimize storage\", its library is almost 50 GB and I suspect my two photo albums are partly to blame. Regardless, I'd rather move these projects to the Mac that contains the full ibrary for safe keeping.\nIs there any way to do this? I can't find any \"export\" option, or some such.\nI asked the same question over on the Apple support community, and the answer was it can't be done. The same answer is given to a similar question on here, but for iPhoto (How do I move an iPhoto '11 book project from one mac to another). \nHowever, when I open up the library using \"Show package contents\" I can actually see what appears to be all the data associated with the projects in resources/projects. I've tried copying one of those directories into the target Photos library, but as soon as Photos is started, the copied directory is removed. It seems that if only I could set the right metadata somewhere, this should work.\n\nA: You can move, via a network, direct thunderbolt connection, or via an external disk, the Photo Library package. You don't need to dig into the package contents.\nA single user can only have one \"System Library\" - this is the one that syncs to iCloud. If you want to merge the libraries then simply enable iCloud for both libraries and let them sync together, then delete the copy you don't want to keep.\n", "Q: Using the -Bless Command on Multiboot Macs with 10.11 El Capitan As part of our standard deployment, we tend to deploy multiple OSs on Macs, from 10.7 to 10.11. However, with the new SIP (System Integrity Protection), the -bless command no longer works properly.\nI need the Macs to boot to each OS during the initial configuration to properly name the OS for Active Directory binding and then do the actual binding. \nI've tried to use the \"csrutil disable\" command recommended in some other places, but that requires booting into the Recovery OS and that change is stored in the NVRAM, so it's local to whatever machine I'm using. Meaning that it won't be part of the 10.11 image deployed. \nIn the end, I need to be able to script multiple -bless commands, telling the Mac to boot to different OSs on separate partitions on the internal hard drive. It's critical to the image process.\nDoes anyone have any idea on how to do such a thing?\n\nA: I've had good luck using AutoDMG and munki's crgateosxintallpkg scripts with 10.11 in beta. I haven't done the work yet on the current build, but i think these SIP issues and bless changes were fit in by Apple before release so you shouldn't have issues using these tools.\nAre you running into a specific error? What MDM or deployment framework are you using? If you have scripts, it might be easier to adopt one of the standard tools than re-working yours, but both are on github so you can see how they are handling SIP/bless if you need that level of detail.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://github.com/MagerValp/AutoDMG\n\n*https://github.com/munki/createOSXinstallPkg\n\n*Automate Yosemite Upgrade\n\n*https://jamfnation.jamfsoftware.com/article.html?id=334\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT205054\nThe last link is Apple's official word on how you will need to script your client Mac to trust the netboot server and the commands needed to navigate the SIP changes for distribution of 10.11 images.\nIn a nutshell, you can list the \"blessed\" netboot servers as opposed to blessing the image itself.\ncsrutil netboot add 10.0.10.10\ncsrutil netboot list\n\n\nA: Virtualization may be an easier solution for this problem. Both VMware Fusion and Parallels can virtualize Mac OS X 10.7.x - 10.11.x.\n", "Q: How to choose the \"From\" account in El Capitan Mail when composing e-mail I use Apple Mail using two e-mail accounts (both IMAP but I don't think it really matters). Before El Capitan when composing an e-mail, one could choose the account the e-mail should be send from using a drop-down in the compose-window. However with the El Capitan update this dropdown is gone and there seems no way to select the account the e-mail should be send from after composing the e-mail.\nThe Mail settings do have an option to select the sending account. Here I can set it to one account or use the open mailbox as indication for which account to send mail from. \nIs there any way to switch the sending account after composing an e-mail in El Capitan?\n\nA: Select your preferred email address in Preferences > Composing > Send new messages from:\nIf for some reason that doesn't work, try rebooting.\n\nA: I just added a new account and I needed to restart the Mail.app to have the From field show up in the New Message window:\n\n\nA: I hit the same problem. My mail (under Yosemite) was configured with one IMAP a/c and one Exchange a/c enabled before the upgrade to El Capitan.\nSince then the From dropdown disappeared (and no - rebooting did not fix it).\nI added a second IMAP a/c, then the From dropdown would come back but only offer the either of the two IMAP a/cs. \nIn the end I deleted the exchange a/c (and extra IMAP) and re-added the exch a/c.\nPresto! \nBack to 1xIMAP and 1xExchange a/c with from dropdown.\nSo the good news is that mail v9 is fine. But the El Capitan upgrade process must have messed up migrating some exchange parameter/s.\n", "Q: Modify router port-forwarding rules from Terminal I'm trying to modify my router's NAT Table / Port-forwarding rules using the terminal on my Mac. My current setup looks something like this\nPublic  <->  Internet  <->  Modem + Router (1.1.1.1)  <->  Macbook (192.168.1.2)\n\nThere's a webserver / app running on port 7919 on my Macbook and I'd like to port-forward it so anyone can access it publicly from the internet. Specifically, I want 1.1.1.1:7919 to forward data to 192.168.1.2:7919.\nI know I can do this by going in to the Router settings web interface, or using other GUI apps such as PortMap, but I need to do this using the command line.\nI've been searching for a solution for hours and still haven't been able to find a simple solution that does this for me. The closest I came was to natd, but it has been deprecated in favor of pfctl, and I can't make any sense of it.\n\nA: After searching for hours, I still wasn't able to find a built-in command-line utility that does what I'm asking for. But I did find something else that's pretty close. It's PortMapper, a java applet that comes with a command-line interface to manage the port-mappings of your router (must be UPnP compatible).\nSince my plan was to do everything from the terminal, I'll walk you through the steps:\n# Download the latest version\ncurl -fSL \"https://sourceforge.net/projects/upnp-portmapper/files/latest/download\" -o portmapper.jar\n\n# See the basic help\njava -jar portmapper.jar -h\n\n# List all port-forwarding rules\njava -jar portmapper.jar -list\n\n# Create a new rule\njava -jar portmapper.jar -add -externalPort 7919 -internalPort 7919 -ip 192.168.1.2 -protocol tcp\n\n# Delete a rule\njava -jar portmapper.jar -delete -externalPort 7919 -protocol tcp\n\n\nThis assumes you have java installed and available in your shell\n", "Q: How can I replace the Mac Mail icon in Mac OS X 10.11 El Capitan? I'm going to give Mac Mail another try. But I can't stand the stamp icon. I'd like to replace it with the iOS icon.\nI have the .icns file but the old \"get info\" trick where you just paste the icon over the existing one doesn't work.  I've also tried \"Show Package Contents\" on the Mail.app and replacing the ApplicationIcon.icns from the Finder and Terminal under sudo. No luck.\nHow can I replace the Mac Mail icon with something a little more consistent with the rest of the OS?\n\nA: The proper way is to:\n\n\n*\n\n*boot your Mac to Recovery Mode by holding CMD+R at startup\n\n*Go to Utilies and Terminal in the menu\n\n*Type csrutil disable and Enter\n\n*Restart normally and change your Icon\n\n\nRepeat the procedure to re-enable System Integrity Protection (SIP or Rootless) but this time, enter csrutil enable\nthat's it !\n\nA: you'll need to turn off the new rootless feature in EC preventing you from modifying a native system app, such as this one. Afterwards, you should be able to modify the permissions for Everyone to Read and Write, in lieu of Custom. Then your 'drag it over' trick will work :) Don't forget to turn rootless back on after, its the biggest advantage in upgrading to EC, IMHO.\n\nA: There is an easier way, download an app called \"Liteicon\" you can get it from softonic its reliable I used it. After you download it open it up go to applications put the icon you want replacing the mail icon then click apply changes and restart your laptop then you will see it changed. \n\nA: A partial workaround, which I discovered by accident:  Before upgrading to El Capitan, paste the icon you want into the 'Get Info' panel for the Mail application. Then make an alias of Mail.\nWhen the upgrade occurs, the Mail program will have its icon changed but the alias will not.  You can then put the alias into the Dock or anywhere you would want it.  The OS even allows you to put it in the 'programs' section of the Dock where it seems to function exactly as a program (ie a second icon does not appear when you run the program through its alias).\nI discovered this because I happened to have made a mail alias under Josemite, and saw that it retained its custom icon (through the upgrade). I tried doing the same thing after the upgrade to El Capitan but discovered that the new OS imposes SIP on aliases too, so if you try to change the icon after upgrading it will, sadly, revert to the blue standard stamp.\n", "Q: MacBook not turning on (fan loop) I'm in a very frustrating situation of having my MacBook Pro 15' Retina (A1398) stuck in a boot loop.

I can show control center via assisitive touch but I can't touch anything. Hard reset (holding sleep/wake + home button) is not working because my sleep/wake button is not working.\nI think it might be related with \"notification center\" because I can't open notification center via assisitive touch.\nAll I can do right now is waiting till my battery runs out (hope this issue will be gone after it restarts)\nIn web programming terms, it seems that there are some kind of z-index difference blocking the layer other than \"Assisitive Touch layer\"\nWhat was happening (in case any of you can replicate it):\n\n\n*\n\n*my wife was borrowing my iphone (LCD still off)\n\n*WhatsApp chat notification came\n\n*she clicked home button (while the LCD still glowing)\n\n*boom! that's all\n\n\nPS:\nI don't want to wipe my iphone, I have a lot of important data in my iphone\n\nA: The solution should be to wait until the battery is drain out and the plug it to the power source to turn it on. Everything should be back to normal.\nBUT in my case, I can't wait until the battery is drain out so I open the iphone by myself then unplug the battery (~4 hours ago). Everything should be back to normal BUT in my case, it made my iphone \"broken\". I did a mistake (I was separating the display from the front panel!!) when I tried to \"suck\" the front panel. Sometimes there are some weird mark on the top of my display and touch on that area is not working :(\nThough I'm not sure, is that happened because of my mistake during opening the front panel OR because I forcibly unplug the battery when the iphone is still ON.\nSo, it is not advisable to open the iphone by yourself. I did that because I really need it at that moment and I can't wait until the battery is drain out (even until now it still 64%).\n\nA: Facing the same issue. Waiting for battery to drain out. Taking forever. \nNotification centre is open and stuck there.Touch works only on the centre, rest half of the screen is non responsive. All i can do is go through my notifications and probably call someone who's call I've missed. I can't even end the call.\n\nA: You could also use Siri (if enabled). Instead of asking unlock my iPhone, ask for opening any app: \n\n\"Open the Settings App\" \n\nfor example. You could then go to your homescreen after entering the code (no swiping here). \nBecause the phone is still working, you should make a backup of the important information. \n\nA: Touch home button and sleep/wake button together, and hold. After few second your phone will restart.\nHope this resolve.\n\nA: hold home and power button pressed for a while and it will shut down.\n\nA: Bit late, but may still help others:\nGetting a new notification seemed to make it work again.\nSo either get someone to text you, setup a new calendar event on your computer or send an email.

They kindly left us with a Command+0 option to toggle its display on and off.\nI let them know that there are various functions that I use as diagnostics and I like to keep them where I can see them at a glance but where they do not interfere with my work. I let them know that I have always had the option to toggle the display on and off and that I also have always had the option to see the window in front of all others, all I had to do is click in it and it immediately came forward.  What they did is to make a decision on my behalf that reduced my options and that is a way of thinking that I don't appreciate.  If they want to give me more options, that is fine but a decision to reduce options is usually a poorly thought out decision.\nI am still looking for a solution through the terminal that might allow me to regain my previous functionality.  They were not forthcoming in this area.  They simply said that at this point, we cannot do it. Not a very good answer, certainly not the one I wanted to hear but I suppose having the answer, like it or not, is helpful in a way.  Now I can dismiss the thought that it was an accident and decide how much time I want to invest in working around their poor thinking.\n", "Q: Spotlight crashes after two letters have been entered OS X 10.11 on an early 2015 MBP\nI am trying to search for a document called Starfleet, but after entering the letters \"ST\", Spotlight crashes.\nRelevant logs:\n\n02/10/15 12:12:37,642 Spotlight[1566]: XPC connection was invalidated\n  02/10/15 12:12:37,824 spindump[769]: Got xpc error message in\n  libspindump client connection: Connection invalid 02/10/15\n  12:12:37,825 com.apple.xpc.launchd[1]: (com.apple.Spotlight[1566])\n  Service exited due to signal: Segmentation fault: 11 02/10/15\n  12:12:37,845 com.apple.xpc.launchd[1]: (com.apple.ReportCrash[1723])\n  Endpoint has been activated through legacy launch(3) APIs.

here:\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/8546951\nYou must uncheck the \"Bookmarks & History\" option in the Spotlight pane of System Preferences.\nIt fixed instantly the problem for me.\n\nA: After a number of frustrating days, I have finally found a solution to this problem. I reindexed the volume for Spotlight, and that solved it.\nThe procedure goes as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*From the Apple () menu, choose System Preferences. \n\n*Click Spotlight.\n\n*Click the Privacy tab. \n\n*Drag a folder or an entire volume (your hard\ndrive) to the list. If prompted for confirmation, click OK. \n\n*Remove the item or volume you just added to the list by clicking it and\nthen clicking the minus (\"-\") button. \n\n*Close Spotlight preferences.\n\n\nSpotlight will re-index the contents of the folder or volume.\nSource: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201716\n", "Q: How to remove mails from mail app and maintain google calendar synchronized with Apple Reminders?

So I tried to run it from /Volumes/Macintosh HD/usr/bin where I have installed OS X. Good news is that csrutil is there. Bad news is it's crashing:\nhttp://pastebin.com/qXVAdkaK\ndyld: Symbol not found: ___NSDictionary0__\n    Referenced from: /Volumes/Macintosh HD/usr/bin/./csrutil\n    Expected in:\n    /System/Library/Frameworks/CoreFoundation.framework/Versions/A/CoreFoundation\nin /Volumes/Macintosh HD/usr/bin/./csrutil\nTrace/BPT trap: 5\n\nAny ideas how to fix it?\n\nA: The crsutil tool runs on 10.11 and not 10.10 or earlier.\nYou'd need to fully install 10.11 El Capitan on a USB drive and boot to that Recovery HD for the proper libraries to be present. When recovery is on a different raw disk than the volume, I suspect you won't get the changes you desire. \n\nA: I've found solution - I just restored Recovery Partition locally on disk using script Recovery Partition Creator (which is working for 10.11 without any problems) - http://musings.silvertooth.us/2013/10/recovery-partition-creator-3-7-updated-for-mavericks/\nNow when I reboot to recovery mode I can turn off SIP just by typing csrutil disable in Terminal.\nSo in general - to get this working you need to have Recovery Partition locally on disk. \n", "Q: How to paste images from clipboard in Safari How do you paste an image from your clipboard in to websites/forms which support pasting, in Safari? \nFor example, in Chrome, I can take a screenshot using shift+ctrl+cmd+4 and then use cmd+v to paste that image in to a Facebook chat. This is very convenient. However, I don't seem to be able to do the same in Safari. Manually right clicking, and selecting paste doesn't seem to work either.\n\nA: This is known issue with the current release of Safari. \nBut pasting images from the clipboard is now working properly in the Safari Technology Preview which means the fix should be coming to the public release version of Safari shortly. \nFYI, You can go ahead and use the tech preview version alongside your regular Safari install without disrupting anything.\nEDIT: Safari 10.1 was released today and fixes this issue.\nEDIT #2: It seems to only work with some source applications but not others. For example, I can select and copy sections of web pages w/images and paste them into Gmail no problem (Safari to Safari). I can also copy text+images from Evernote to Gmail. But... the same doesn't seem to work when TextEdit or Notes is the source.\nRelevant bug report\n\nA: It seems this is still an active bug (or possibly misfeature depending on your perspective). Support for pasting (WebKit bug #49141) is apparently implemented in both WebKit upstream and Safari, but it seems to have been done so in a way that is not compatible with anything (WebKit bug #170449).\nThe BugZilla for the latter bug suggests that there is an associated radar within Apple about this.\nIn other words, I guess the straight answer to your question is \"wait for either Apple to conform to what everyone else is doing, or for support for Safari's way of doing things to percolate everywhere\", whichever happens first.\nEdit: It seems to consistently work for me in Safari Technology Preview (Release 52 (Safari 11.2, WebKit 13606.1.9.3.1)) under High Sierra, including on both Trello and Facebook.\n", "Q: Changing the shortcut for highlighting text in Preview How do I change the keyboard shortcut for highlighting text in Preview (OS X Yosemite)? By default it is Ctrl+Command+H, but I'd prefer a different combination (maybe Ctrl+E) as that’s easier to use. However, the following method does not work. How do I resolve this?\n\n\nA: For nested menu items, separate the menu levels with -> without any spaces. You also have to include the top-level menu item. In this case that would be:\nTools->Annotate->Highlight Text\n\nIf Highlight Text is a unique menu item in Preview, you can also just use Highlight Text and omit the rest.\n\nA: The error is that you've partly listed the hierarchy, though incorrectly. Normally, you don't need to specify the menu hierarchy at all - simply use 'Highlight Text' as your menu item.  \nYou can use the hierarchy syntax, as mentioned in Arthur Hammer's answer - Tools->Annotate->Highlight Text - but unless there is potential for confusion, if the same command was present in two hierarchies, performing slightly different tasks, for instance, then there is no need.\nStrangely, I cannot make any hotkey work if I specify that item for Preview only, as suggested in comments. Frankly, I have no idea why it would not work, as that would be the standard way to implement something like this.\nEdit: This appears to have been a bug in that particular version of Preview & now works as expected.\nTesting a similar sub-menu in Safari by adding  Ctrl ⌃   E  to Check Spelling While Typing works perfectly.\n\nThe workaround appears to be what you almost had - to enter it as a system-wide hotkey, then it works just fine.\n \n\nA: In OS X El Capitan 10.11.4 - macOS Catalina (10.15), you are able to set up a custom shortcut like this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the Preview app.\n\n*Enter Preview -> Services -> Services Preferences\n\n\n*Choose App Shortcuts\n\n\n*Click on the + button and the fill in the fields like below. It is important that the Menu Title perfectly matches the operation name to which you want to assign the shortcut.\n\n\n*Done. Now you can highlight text in Preview using your custom shortcut.\n\n", "Q: Conflict between devices in call log if we have the same Apple ID I have iOS 9.0.2 on an iPhone 5s and my wife has an iPhone 6 with the same iOS version. We have the same Apple ID and we have issue after upgrading the two call logs are the same now. If she has a call I will find it in my log.\n\nA: Yes, this is part of iCloud which synchronises features across multiple devices which use the same primary Apple ID. If you don't wish this to synchronise, change your primary Apple ID on one of the devices.\n", "Q: Apple Remote Desktop - Safari Homepage - How to set to Home Page Using Apple Remote Desktop, how do I initiate Safari, to began with a preferred web site?\nExample, I have 50 Mac(s) on my network, and I want each users automatically began on a specific default web site as their Safari Home Page.\nThank you so much and have a beautiful day.\nFabio\n\nA: The fastest thing that comes to my mind is to send an UNIX command to the clients with the following contents:\ndefaults write com.apple.Safari HomePage 'http://example.com'\n\nThis sets the Safari homepage for the user that runs the command.\nI hope this helps.\n", "Q: OS X El Capitan Disk Utilities First Aid Fails - Now What? The system is seemingly running fine, yet a recommended First Aid repair failed. What's my next step? I Googled this deeply and couldn't find a current, relevant pointer. Any tips appreciated!\n\nA: Sorry, I don't have a good answer. The problem went away when I was trying to collect more data.\n\nA: You are pretty light on details but generally speaking when this happens you should boot into recovery mode (Command R) when booting the Mac and go into Disk Utility and try to repair from there.\nFailing that you may have to go with a 3rd-party disk repair tool. My go-to is DiskWarrior, there are others that work well too.\n", "Q: Mission control font is aliased in OS X El Capitan I just upgraded my Mac to 10.11 and noticed the aliased font in Mission Control. I tried to include a screenshot of it, hope the issue is clear.\n \nThe font was fine in Yosemite. Is anybody facing the very same issue? I could not find a proper setting about it in the System Preferences.\n\nA: Comparing to my screenshot:\n\nThe font in my OS X 10.11 is all OK. \n\n\n*\n\n*Maybe it means it is bold, why Apple changed the font style.  Maybe it\n\n*Maybe be a bug of OS X 10.11. Report it to Apple.\n\n\nA: As usual, witchcraft followed.\nI reported this issue to Apple hoping to get any feedback, but nothing happened. A couple of days later, a system update was released and the issue was fixed.\nSo, the only concrete advice I can give regarding this particular issue is: make sure to get the last patches installed. :)\n", "Q: How to mask images in Keynote into circles? I have a bunch of photos that I need on a single slide, and I'd like them all to be shown as circles.\nCan I do that out-of-the-box with Keynote?\n\nA: Yes.\nThis works for any shape. Here's how:\n\n\n*\n\n*Draw a shape.\n\n*Resize it to the desired size.\n\n*Position the shape over the image.\n\n*Select both by shift-clicking them.\n\n*Choose Format → Image → Mask with Shape from the menu (these menu items are from Keynote 6.5.2, might be different for your version)\n\n*Mask the image as you'd usually do (by dragging, resizing).\n\n*Click Done.\n\n\nA: Actually, it is unnecessary to create a shape in order to mask the image.\n\n\n*\n\n*Place an image on the slide\n\n*Select the image\n\n*In the Menu Bar, go to Format > Image > Mask with shape > [select shape]\nNow drag the mask as desired.\nSet this image as a Media Placeholder by selecting the image then, Format > Advanced > Define as Media Placeholder\nCopy the image as many times as desired on the slide and then drag new images to them. The mask will be applied to the new image as well.\n\n\n\n", "Q: iWorks no longer free after fresh install of El Capitan I just installed a fresh copy of El Capitan on my MacBook Pro Retina (2013 model), and iWorks are no longer free in the App Store, as has been the case in Yosemite. See the screenshot:\n\nWhat are the possible causes and solutions?\nI also changed the Apple ID on this computer, if that may be relevant.\n\nA: The Apple business model is the opposite to that of Microsoft.\nPurchases are tied to you & your Apple ID, not to the machine they run on.\nThis makes migrating to a new machine very simple, but juggling purchases across multiple IDs difficult. Apple doesn't want you setting up multiple IDs just on a whim, it wants one user tied to one ID.\nOnce you start juggling IDs, you will find that each time you need to update anything, you will need to logout of your current ID & log back in with the one used for that particular purchase.\nEither that or set up Family Sharing with all your IDs as the members of the 'family'.\n\nA: If you really had all those apps before you did a fresh OS installation then do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to App Store\n\n*Click on Store\n\n*Click on View my account and sign in with the credentials that you initially used when you were using all those apps before you did the fresh install\n\n*Now it takes you to your account info but no need to look at that\n\n*Click on the Store again\n\n*And click on the Purchased\n\n\nYou will see all the apps that you own in your apple account\nHope that helps because that helped me. \n\nA: You could try using the Migration Assistant from your backup to copy over the Applications from your previous installation.\nYou did make a backup?\n\nA: I just had the same question.  To be able to download iWorks or any other (eg. Numbers...) \n\n\n*\n\n*Open App Store\n\n*Click on \"Store\" tab\n\n*Down to \"View My Account\" and sign in\n\n*Once page opens, go down to \"Hidden Items\" click \"Manage\"\n\n*A page will come up with an item and the word \"Hidden\" - click it and then click \"Done\"\n\n*You should see what you're looking for in the list that comes up.

I know you can make a USB Drive after downloading El Capitan, but I am trying to skip the download itself.  \n\nA: Don't is my recommendation. This is how malware gets introduced into Apple software - like the Xcode ghost where developers were not downloading from Apple and not checking the validity of the software they installed.\nIf you call AppleCare, they might sell you physical media or even comp the shipping charge if they feel yours is a legitimate need to avoid the download. You could also find someone you trusted to have them make you an installer and ship it to you.\nI have known people that went to an Apple store and asked if they could sign in to the App Store on a Mac there and download the installer to a USB drive. Since the store probably runs a caching server, even downloading 10 GB of data would proceed in a matter of minutes. \n\n\n*\n\n*What is the best way to generate a Yosemite or Mavericks Install USB flash drive?\n\nA: https://7labs.heypub.com/tips-tricks/el-capitan-direct-download.html\ngo to this site and you will get instructions on how you can download it.\n", "Q: Problems in OS X with Transmit “Mount to Disk” after Mac upgrade to El Capitan I got a problem in Transmit, after upgrading my Mac to El Capitan (v 10.11).

When I press Play in Keynote, Keynote used to split the presentation with the presenter view on my Macbook and the audience view on the projector. \nNow, however, it just stays in mirrored mode. So I have to exit the presentation and go into System Preference and make the change in Displays. It's very annoying when the presentation includes a demo and I'm constantly switching things up every time I go in and out of the presentation.\nI could have sworn that Keynote used to be smart enough to do this for me... which was quite graceful!

Am I misremembering? \n\nA: In Keynote version 6.6:\n\n\n*\n\n*Keynote > Preferences... ⌘+,\n\n*Slideshow tab\n\n*Tick the Enable Presenter Display check box\n\n\nThen go to Play > Customize Presenter Display... to be sure the output is as you expect.\n\n\n\nA: I've been having the same problem and it's very frustrating. you're not mis-remembering! It did use to do this, and that solution does not help UNTIL you also go to System Preferences > Display and turn off the \"mirror\" mode! then it seems to be working as I want it to!\n", "Q: Microsoft Outlook for Mac 2011 \"Not Responding\" after upgrade to Mac OS X 10.11 El Capitan I'm experiencing issue with my Microsoft Outlook for Mac 2011 after upgrading to Mac OS X 10.11 El Capitan.\nActivity Monitor and/or Force Quit Applications shows Microsoft Outlook is Not Responding.\nI found following knowledge base article:\nOutlook for Mac 2011 on OS X 10.11 hangs during account sync operation\nMicrosoft's workaround:\n\nTo work around this issue, run Outlook for Mac 2011 on Mac OS X\n  Yosemite (version 10.10) or an earlier version.\n\nIs there anything else I can do?\n\nFIX: Microsoft Office for Mac 2011 14.5.6 update\n\nA: Microsoft has an update to fix the problem now.\nFor more information, check out this knowledge base article documenting the problem: https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3098396\n\nShortly after you start Microsoft Outlook for Mac 2011 on Mac OS X El Capitan (version 10.11), Outlook hangs when it tries to sync with the server.

I have an iPod5. I have been using iCloud for backups. However, I have an issue in a particular app that only goes away when I fully reset the device. (The issue in the app persists if I restore from iCloud backup, but that’s not what I want addressed here). So, at the moment, my iOS device is running as if it were a fresh new iOS install. I want to be able to keep going with this install and have it backed up to iCloud. However, I also want to keep my old backup around so that I can go back to that later.\nI thought that iCloud would automatically start a new backup series when I chose to set up my iPod5 as a “New” device. However, when I look at the backups UI, I get the impression that I am going to lose my old backup as soon as it performs the next backup.\nUnder iCloud → Backup, I see “Last Backup: 1:37 AM”. That is the timestamp of the backup I performed on this iPod before resetting it:\n\nUnder “Manage Storage” when viewing iCloud settings through the device, it lists the iPod I’m using as matching the backup I made before I set up my iPod as a new iPod. The backup that it says is associated with this iPod is the very one I want to preserve when I make a backup of my iPod:\n\nAnd when visiting that screen, you can see the discrepancy between the backup that looks like it will be overwritten and the backup that iOS plans on overwriting it with:\n\nSo, how do I get iOS iCloud backups to start a new backup or save/checkpoint/rename the old one? I’m starting to fear that my only option is to restore the old backup, make a backup in iTunes, and then manage storage of that backup manually which is a pain that I hoped iCloud would be able to prevent…\nIn an answer to another question, I read:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*You can have multiple backups in iCloud for a device and choose which backup to restore from (assuming there are no device/iOS compatibility issues).\n  \n\nMy question is: how? ;-)\n\nA: You can't fork a backup on the iCloud servers.\nAll you can do is delete the existing backup and then start one over. Over time, abandoned forked backups get pruned and deleted as well, so keep that in mind if you manage to separate things.\n\n\n*\n\n*Disable iCloud Backup without deleting existing backup?\n\nA: You could disable backup for that app (Settings --> iCloud Settings --> Storage --> Manage Storage --> Your Device --> turn the troublesome app off).  You may want to backup on the computer just in case, as an extra precaution.  Once disabled, you should reset device and restore the most recent backup, with the app disabled.\n\nA: Go to iCloud settings -> back up -> back up now\n", "Q: How can I reset my user account password on OS X? My MacBook keeps saying that my password is wrong. I haven't changed it in a year. I have tried to reboot it, but I have no idea how to do it. I have my laptop in recovery mode.\n\nA: A plausible way of resetting the password of your login on your OS X is to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Single-user mode (CMD  + S on boot)\n\n*Type: /sbin/mount -uw / and press Enter\n\n*Type rm /var/db/.applesetupdone and press Enter\n\n*Type reboot and press Enter.\nOn boot, you will be prompted to setup like if your mac was new. Don't panic, as your data is not lost (I would backup just in case though). Skip all unnecessary options, and later you will be prompted to create a new admin account.\nOnce your setup finishes, from the new account, go to System Preferences > Users and Groups, click on your previous username and click Reset Password. Now type in the new password and login as your old account.\n", "Q: How do I send imessages to non-iphone users on my macbook os x, if I don't have an iphone?

But i also want to send messages to my family members, who don't have iphones.\n\nA: Create contacts for your non-iPhone users in Contacts.app, then iMessage should use SMS to connect.

I am trying to decide whether I should run Linux natively or through a VM on MacBook 7,2? How much performance difference would I observe? Is it worth installing Linux natively or is running it through a VM sufficient?\n\nA: If you do not need real performance, you should run a VM. It's MUCH easier to install and the support with mac is better. For instance, you won't have any problem with your trackpad under a VM. \nHowever, if you need some huge performances or direct hardware access, you should run linux natively, if you want to run Kali Linux and do some pen testing, using a VM would be a pain because it would slow down a lot cryptography and access to the wifi drivers for exemple. \nSo for what you want to do, I suggest you to install a nice linux distribution on a VM, for instance a Debian based linux like Ubuntu. If you can afford a paid VM software like VMWare it would be much smoother and better integrated with your Mac, but for your purpose, I think VirtualBox would do the job !\n", "Q: After asking to be remembered to return a call, geofence won't go off When someone called me, I tapped on the \"Remind me later\" button, I called back without the phone telling me, but I noticed that the geofence icon won't shut off even after resets. Why is this happening and how can I prevent it from draining my battery? According to the Location Settings the service that is using geofence is the location based alerts.\n\nA: To disable the reminder, open Reminders.app and check the \"Call [person]\" reminder. \nWith location based reminders, they will go off every time you enter (or leave, depending on the setting) the area until you mark them as completed. \n\nVery much a side note, but in iOS 9 you can now keep tabs on what apps are draining your battery. So if you are concerned about battery drain, go to Settings -> Battery and validate (or invalidate) those concerns.\n", "Q: Dock isn't responding to mouse movement in Yosemite when external mouse (Cyborg R.A.T. 5) is attached For the past few days now, I've come across a peculiar error with my Dock. It won't respond to my mouse moving down to the bottom of the screen until I click it, and when it does, it won't change the active icon when I drag my mouse over it. Here's a video of what happens.\nThis is accompanied by a peculiar error in Mission Control where I can't click on windows to enter them until I drag them a little bit. Here's a video of that phenomenon.\n\nUpdate: I've found out that this happens when I attach my external mouse (a Cyborg R.A.T. 5) to the computer. I'll test other external mice and then maybe file a bug report with Apple.\n\nA: Okay, so it turns out the thing I was doing wrong was having an external mouse attached to the Macbook. As soon as I detached the mouse (an old Cyborg R.A.T. 5), everything started working normally again.\nBut it's still weird that that happens.\n", "Q: OS X 10.11 unable to press \"allow\" on Keychain Access dialogs I'm running into an issue where keychain password verification box does not verify password - does not shake for incorrect password and nothing happens when I press \"allow\". I'm using iCloud keychain.\nWhat could make the Keychain Access wants to... dialog box to not verify the password?\nNothing happens when I press \"Allow\" with password enters. The box does not shake when password is incorrect:\n\n\nA: For me, I had to go to System Preferences -> Security & Privacy -> Privacy.\nOn the left, click on Accessibility, then on the right side uncheck every checkbox. This resolves the problem. For me, I had Steam (from VALVe) running and Karabiner (keyboard key editor) which also was allowed to control the computer.\n\nA: Just got this fixed. I use a plugin called SmoothMouse that improves acceleration of trackpad and mouse. It likely integrates with the accessibility APIs in OS X and thus triggers the same behavior as screensharing. Disabling the plugin resolved the problem.\nYou can see the sister StackOverflow question here as well.\n\nA: I encountered this same issue today. I could not \"Allow\" or \"Always Allow\" any programs, nor could I confirm my password in any dialogues. The interface wouldn't shake, even if I had entered the incorrect password.\nI use Synergy to facilitate programming over several different computers. My mouse and keyboard do not belong to the Mac OSX device. I was able to hit the \"Allow\" button once I used a mouse actually hooked up the Mac OSX device.\nIn general, try turning off any virtual or physical KVM services and use the Mac mouse/keyboard directly.\nHopefully this can help you or someone else who comes here looking for help.\n", "Q: An undiagnosable screen fault (flickering/glitching) I have been experiencing an intermittent screen flickering/glitching. The problem occurs where I use, or leave the laptop on for several hours, until I let the laptop rest (i.e. shut it down and leave it off) for several days, then promptly starts again with a couple of hours of use.\nThe flickering/glitching affects the whole screen. I don't think the attached image does the problem much justice. The whole image on screen appears to shake, moving up and down, ghosting between two 'screens'. The problem started with faint horizontal lines across the screen and then escalated within a matter of hours.\nI have taken the Macbook Pro into an Authorised Apple Service Provider who were unable to diagnose the fault with their diagnostic systems; as a result they weren't prepared to replace any hardware. The service provider has proved fruitless. Has anyone else had a similar experience?\n\n\nA: If possible, try using a second display (through Mini-DisplayPort or Thunderbolt). \nThe objective is to find if the issue is the LCD panel (Screen) or the GPU (Video Chip/\"Card\"). \nIf the issue persists on a secondary/external display, the issue is the GPU. If the issue is limited to the built in display, you've narrowed down the source of the issue to your LCD. \nHave you noticed any other patterns, such as use of Safari or other apps? Some apps, upon opening, switch from basic \"integrated\" graphics, to the more powerful \"discrete\" graphics chip, and its possible that this change is causing the distortion.\nEDIT: I should also note that service providers' diagnostics are unable to detect connection issues with the LCD panel (unless completely disconnected), so any tests they run will be inconclusive if its the LCD. LCD issues simply require visual inspection, and your photo should be sufficient proof. Source: Apple Employee/tech for 8+ years\n\nA: I'm having the same (or similar) problem. You should give details of your Mac (yr, make, OS) and steps you took to fix it.\nI would like to detail out the steps I took to try to identify & rectify the issue.\n\n*\n\n*Try resetting your NVRAM: Shut down and while pressing and holding Command + Option + P + R keys restart the Mac. Your Mac will go off and you can release the keys once it does (once you hear the startup sound). This should reset the NVRAM\n\n*Reset the SMC: Shutdown your Mac. Press & hold Power + Option + Control + Shift for about 20 seconds. This resets the SMC. Please note: this is applicable for Macs with non-removable batteries only.\n\nI tried these but it seems like there is some hardware issue (I need to confirm this)\nI have a mid 2010 13\" MBP. All of a sudden a day back I noticed the screen started flickering and it's very difficult to make out stuff on the screen. I tried several things (after looking up on YouTube) but none worked (resetting SMC, NVRAM, reinstalling OS, restoring from Time Machine).\nTo give some details, the issue is across apps, screens although it's most observable on Firefox and even after turning its hardware acceleration off from its preferences, it's no better. On Safari, the display is still blotted but much better than Firefox and that's where I'm currently using the Mac.\nI'm yet to plug onto another display (as I'd need an adapter for mini DP to HDMI) and I'd be updating once I do that.\nI know this is an old machine and has probably run its time, but it still works great, especially I upgraded its battery & SSD about 2 months back (I already had upgraded the RAM to 8 GB & from HDD to SSD some 5 years back but SSD was only 130GB, and I added another SSD 250GB, 2 months back).\nI'm not sure if I want to spend any more than $100 on this machine (since I already spent like $200 2 months back hoping this would give me runway till the next MBP launches in '21)\nUpdate: I had learned to live with it & have been using the system for the last 3-4 days with the flickering/glitches (it's less on Safari, unusable on Firefox) and just now, all of a sudden, without me doing anything, it all became fine (didn't restart or anything, it just went from glitches to perfect)\n", "Q: Recovery partition in the middle of the file system I have a problem with my recovery partition. Before update to the el-capitan I had both osx and windows on the same ssd disc created with Boot Camp. The problem is that something went wrong during the upgrade to el-capitan, and I decided to remove the windows partition through Boot Camp. My disc has 250 GB, but for my system is available only 180GB, and I'm not able to find how I can extend the size of my partition. Below I'm attaching the screen from Disc Utility.\n\nDo you know how can I use my free disc space? Probably I have to move my Recovery partition to the end of my disc, but I'm not so sure about that.\nAnd here is the print screen from diskutil list command:\n\n\nA: To fix:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot into the OS as normal.\n\n*Open a terminal and type: diskutil list\n\n*Repair the disk: diskutil repairVolume /dev/disk0s3 (where disk0s3 is your recovery disk)\n\n*Verify the disk: diskutil verifyVolume /dev/disk0s3\n\n*Resize the partition: sudo diskutil resizeVolume /dev/disk0s3 650M (and enter your Mac passcode)\n\n\nIf successful, restart your Mac and after open disk utility and resize your core partition. Done.\n\nA: I had a similar problem and resolved by using Disk Utility that was on an external drive with Sierra installed.\nHope that helps\nMark\n", "Q: Is there any way to block automatic IOS updates? I know my personal devices (iPhone / iPad) wont install updates automatically but it is downloading them automatically even with the settings turned off. What can I do to prevent automatic downloads of these updates so I can conserve my data usage? \n\nA: Google-fu would seem to think the only way is to keep your device too full to take the download.\nYou can prevent it from downloading over 'mobile data' but not if it can see WiFi.\nTo prevent mobile downloads, go to Settings > App & iTunes Stores & disable the Use Mobile Data option.\nThe specific types above are to prevent the phone downloading other data types at all - meaning you will need to update via iTunes on your computer.  \nNone of those options will prevent an iOS update from downloading [even Updates, which you may think would be the one] but the Mobile option will prevent it using your phone's data plan.\n\n\nA: There are two additional ways you can accomplish this without jailbreaking, which is highly undesirable for security reasons.\nThe first (poor) way is to ensure the device does not have enough disk space remaining to install the update. This method will prevent the device from updating and showing updates, but at the expense of only having limited space for data at all times.\nThe second and much better solution is to install an Apple TVOS beta program configuration profile on the iPhone. To do this, sign up for an Apple Developer account and join the TVOS beta program. Look for the download link Install the configuration profile directly on your device to receive OTA updates for Apple TV. Download and install this configuration profile on the IOS device, then reboot the device. (To undo the procedure, remove the profile and reboot the device again.) The configuration profile is only good for a year or so, at which point it will expire and you will need to reinstall it again.\nHow it works:\nThe configuration profile instructs your device to look for iOS updates from Apple's TVOS update servers instead of Apple's IOS update servers. When IOS gets notified that the TVOS server has an update, it checks to see if the update is appropriate for the phone (which it is not -- it's a iPhone, not an Apple TV!) and then refuses to install the update. A side effect of this behavior is that the iPhone no longer checks Apple's iOS servers for updates...\n\nA: If you're open to jailbreaking your devices to achieve this, there are some tweaks you can install that will help. On my iPhone 5 running iOS 8.4, I have Mikoto installed, and among its smorgasbord of features includes disabling the OTA software update abilities included in iOS, which will prevent downloading of future firmware files. In my experience, it's worked great so far.\n", "Q: iCloud Music Library and multi-CD audiobooks: Duplicate error So I've imported an audiobook into my iTunes library.\nIt consists of 4 CDs with about 11 tracks each. I've given them the proper author info and album info. I also gave each CD the proper number before import, and then iTunes did the rest by importing the tracks as Track 01, Track 02, etc... And giving them track number data in the info. There's 44 tracks total between the 4 CDs. They started importing to iCloud, and everything goes fine until just one track (Track 03, disc 4) decides it doesn't want to upload. It has the duplicate icon. When I click it, it says \"This song is already in your iCloud Music Library.\" The problem is that there really isn't a duplicate. That file hasn't uploaded to iCloud, as I can see every track but that one from my iPod Touch with iCloud music. I think it may be thinking it's a duplicate with one of the other Track 03's in the album, even though the Get Info data differs in CD number.\nCould this be what's going on? Is there any way I can fix this?\nHere's basically what it looks like \nI have right clicked that one track and clicked Add to iCloud Library, and it begins to try but then it goes back to the Duplicate icon and error. \n\nA: First what I did was create a backup of the media folder (containing the imported files) under Music/iTunes/iTunes Media/Music/ARTIST/ALBUM\nThen, I just deleted the entire collection on iTunes (Choosing delete songs instead of remove downloads). This deletes the copy store in iTunes folder, but not the backup I created.\nLast, I just refreshed iTunes by going to File > Add to Library > (backup folder), and it copied the files back in, add uploaded them all at once, which solved the problem.\n", "Q: How to Sync Notes El Capitan to iOS 9 via IMAP Yes, I know Apple says this will no longer work. But it continues to work just fine on iOS 9 devices. Both iPad and iPhone iOS 9 devices continue to sync via my IMAP account. I enter or modify a note on iPad and I see the change on iPhone immediately, and vice versa. And my web mail client see the Notes folder with the updates. All sub-folders are visible in iPhone and iPad and in the web mail client...but not on Mac OS X.\nHow can I fix my Mac Notes configuration to reenable syncing via IMAP? I don't need the new features of Notes on El Capitan... I need basic synchronization of simple notes between all devices. I can't use iCloud or any other for-profit web service, I need to sync through a specific IMAP server for compliance reasons.\nI've tried restoring the old Notes app, but Apple disallows this during the Time Machine restore function.\nThanks\n\nA: When using notes.app in El Capitan, I've noticed that the account settings are lost in the Notes config file. It's a sqlite3 file, I've described what to do in my blog: Refaire fonctionner Notes avec IMAP sous OSX El Capitan. It's in french you may use google translate if you can't read french.\nIt says that you need to open with sqlite3 file ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.Notes/Data/Library/Notes/NotesV6.storedata\nand execute some SQL statements with your imap settings (account, server, prefix)\n\nA: For anyone else stumbling over this because Notes.app stopped syncing IMAP based notes in El Capitan 10.11.3, the solution which worked for me is the following:\nFirstly, check that the IMAP Path Prefix is correct for the account. This can be done in System Preferences / Internet Accounts / (select your account) / Advanced or in Mail.app / Preferences / Accounts / (select your IMAP account) / Advanced. In my case, this was set correctly to INBOX, but sometimes requires different values, or no value at all.\nSecondly, the solution given above by @rene actually works, but it's in French, so here's a step-by-step approach that worked for me.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Terminal.app to get a command prompt\n\n*Change directory to the following folder:\n\n\nbash> cd ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.Notes/Data/Library/Notes/\n\n\n*Make a backup the file NotesV6.storedata so that you can restore it in case something goes wrong\n\n\nbash> cp NotesV6.storedata NotesV6.storedata.old\n\n\n*Open NotesV6.storedata with sqlite3\n\n\nbash> sqlite3 NotesV6.storedata\n\n\n*A new sqlite prompt will appear - you can always exit by pressing CTRL-D\nsqlite>\n\n\n*(Optional) You can examine the table that we need to fix by entering the followoing command\n\n\nsqlite> .schema ZACCOUNT\n\n\n*The ZACCOUNT table contains all accounts which Notes.app is accessing. However, in my case, the IMAP based account entry was missing information about username (field ZUSERNAME), hostname (field ZHOSTNAME) and path prefix (field ZSERVERPATHPREFIX). This is the information we need to update.\n\n*You can dump the whole table by invoking \nsqlite> select * from ZACCOUNT\nbut it's probably easier to select a few relevant fields and identify the Z_PK id of your account\nsqlite> select Z_PK,ZFULLNAME,ZPARENTACACCOUNTIDENTIFIER,ZUSERNAME, ZHOSTNAME, ZSERVERPATHPREFIX from ZACCOUNT;\nThis produced the following output for me:\n1||\n4|Exchange|EF792FA7-AAAA-CCCC-5678-123456789012|||\n5|IMAPaccount|187229D1-BBBB-DDDD-1234-098765431287|||\n\nAs you can see by the field divider lines (|) at the end of the last line, fields for username, hostname, and prefix are empty for the IMAP account (Z_PK id 5) which is what needs to be corrected.\n\n\n*Update the table entry by invoking:\n\n\nupdate ZACCOUNT set ZUSERNAME='email@example.com', ZHOSTNAME='imap.hostname.com',ZSERVERPATHPREFIX='INBOX.' where Z_PK=5;\nYou will of course need to set the correct field values and also adjust the Z_PK id with the correct reference, which you identified above.\n\n\n*As soon as I'd updated the table, Notes.app started magically syncing the notes from my IMAP based accounts.\n\n", "Q: iMessages sent from email address and not received by iPhone Whenever I send someone a text, I'm told that it shows that \"myname@icloud.com\" is sending the text and not my phone number. And when someone responds to \"myname@icloud.com\", I receive the message on my computer and Wi-Fi only iPad, but not my iPhone. Is there any way to only send and receive messages from a phone number?\nI've done what it says on the forum to go to settings, messages, send and receive then it just says me emails and my number is just spinning it doesn't give me any other options.\n\nA: On your iPhone, turn iMessage off and back on and wait for activation.\n", "Q: Stuck on 'Preparing to partition disk' When I add a new partition it gets stuck on 'Preparing to partition disk'.\nThe new partition is in some empty space in the middle of the disk. As a result of the partition not being there, Windows won't boot because its looking for it.\nNo error, nothing. Any ideas?\n\nA: This, and other similar problems are commonly fixed with these 2 methods:\n\nMethod 1\nGo to single-user mode CMD+S on boot). Type the following:\n/sbin/fsck -fy\n\nHit enter, and then type\nreboot\n\nand then press enter.

Shamelessly copied from the 'Power Efficiency in OSX' PDF from apple.com. It is an easy read.\n\nApp Nap\nWhile your Mac can run many different apps at the same time, the\n  reality is that you’re typically interacting with only one of them,\n  and in some cases (such as using a full-screen app), you can’t even\n  see what the other apps are doing. App Nap takes advantage of this\n  fact by putting applications that you can’t see into a special low-\n  power state that regulates their CPU usage as well as network and disk\n  I/O. App Nap can be automatically triggered in the following\n  situations: \n• The app’s windows are not visible.\n• The app is not playing audio.\n• The developer has not explicitly made the app exempt from App Nap by using the existing IOKit IOPMAssertion API (currently used in OS X to prevent the system from sleeping while an app is busy).\n• An app is in background and hasn’t drawn recently.\n\nBtw: GIF is pronounced as pronounced as ɡɪf or dʒɪf ;)\n", "Q: Installation of Adobe Creative Suite 6 hangs at AdobeHelp on Mac OS X El Capitan I have been attempting to install Adobe Creative Suite 6 Production Premium after upgrading to Mac OS X El Capitan.\nThe installation seems to go along flawlessly until it attempts to install \"AdobeHelp\".

(Or I assume any of the other CS6 products)\n\n*In Finder navigate to CS6 ProdPrm, then Adobe CS6 Production Premium, then payloads, then AdobeHelp, and execute Adobe Air Install.app.\n\n*Once the previous step is complete navigate to CS6 ProdPrm, then Adobe CS6 Production Premium, then payloads, then AdobeHelp, and execute AdobeHelp.air.\nNote: As Karl pointed out, the AIR installer bundled with certain CS6 products may not install on Mac OS X El Capitan. If this is the case, you will need to navigate to https://get.adobe.com/air/ and and download and install Adobe AIR.\n\n*Once the previous step is complete navigate to CS6 ProdPrm, then Adobe CS6 Production Premium, and run Install.app.\n\nA: The above answer almost worked fully for me. Basically I think the biggest problem is the Adobe Air. The one included with the CS6 installer just wouldn't install. I downloaded the most recent version of Adobe Air from Adobe.com and installed that and then followed step 4 of the instruction above:\n\n\n*Once the previous step is complete navigate to CS6 ProdPrm, then Adobe CS6 Production Premium, then payloads, then AdobeHelp, and execute AdobeHelp.air\n\n\nOnce this was installed, I was able to install CS6 normally with no problems.\n\nA: I think I may have found another and somewhat easier solution to this issue. I have been trying to install DesignStandard_CS6 and experienced the same issue, with the installer hanging at AdobeHelp. I tried navigating to the /Volumes/CS6 DesignStd/Adobe CS6 Design Standard/payloads/AdobeHelp and just running the Adobe AIR Installer. I found it was blocked by the Security & Privacy setting \"Allow apps downloaded from:\" which was set to the default \"Mac App Store and identified developers\".\nThis gave me the idea to change this setting to \"Anyway\" and hey presto, the installer completed when I tried it again. \nI have not tried and tested this beyond my case, but it seems to make sense that this is what was causing it to hang.\nHope this helps. \n\nA: I ran into a similar problem installing Photoshop CS5 on Mac OS 10.11 \"El Capitan\". The installer would hang at AdobeHelp. After completing the above steps mentioned by Andrew and Karl, I was finally able to get the install to proceed but only after making a few additional tweaks. Following is a brief summary of the entire procedure I followed:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the most recent version of Adobe Air from Adobe.com.\n\n*Mount the downloaded image and install Adobe Air by executing Adobe Air Installer.app.\n\n*Reboot.\n\n*Mount the Photoshop_12_LS1.dmg disk image.\n\n*Navigate to the mounted volume Adobe Photoshop CS5/Adobe Photoshop CS5/payloads/AdobeHelp/ then execute AdobeHelp.air.\n\n*Allow AdobeHelp to update when prompted.\n\n\nThis is the part I had to figure out for CS5:\n\n\n*Copy the contents of the installer image Adobe Photoshop CS5 to your local disk by holding option and dragging it to the desktop.\n\n*Once copying is complete, navigate to ~/Desktop/Adobe Photoshop CS5/Adobe Photoshop CS5/payloads/AdobeHelp/ and replace the Adobe AIR Installer.app with the version of the file downloaded from Adobe.com.\n\n*Proceed with the installation by executing Install.app in the Adobe Photoshop CS5 directory.\n\n\nA: Here is another possible solution.. after multiple hangups and no progress, updated air and java which did not help.  After this, I discovered that when you open the installation process, if you select the individual apps you are installing and uncheck the processes in the photo below, it doesn't hang up and installs just fine and runs perfectly well.. at first I thought it was the extra system font package in those areas that was causing the hangup, but then when I installed dreamweaver, the first time it hung up when I left the two extras checked, then unchecked, the app installed and ran perfectly fine.. this may be a solid solution until Adobe addresses it..(if they do, regardless of those elitists who say the program is years old, it was still a big investment for me so I would like to get more use out of it).. also, I installed most of the suite using this method, everything is functional except After Effects, but, I had the same issue with it on the older system and oddly found the previous version of AE worked just fine, which is ok by me as I get most of what I need from Premiere  \n", "Q: Replacement for CoRD (Microsoft RDP ) I've been using CoRD heavily over the last few years, in my day-to-day job where I need to connect to Microsoft RDP servers. CoRD is perfect for my needs, mainly as it presents a single \"unified\" view: rather than having lots of windows open, there's just one window for all connected servers, and I click between which one I want to view.\nHowever, CoRD was a bit flaky on Yosemite, and is downright unstable on El Capitan. I've tried various other RDP packages, including the \"official\" Microsoft client, but none of them are as simple and/or useful as CoRD.\nCoRD development seems to have been abandoned years ago. Does anyone know of an alternative RDP client that'll easily support multiple simultaneous connections, preferably in a single window? \n\nA: I have moved to VM Fusion and created a Windows 8.1 virtual machine and on that run the Windows Remote Desktop Connection Manager. Not a free solution but an incredible improvement over just using Cord. Now that Cord is basically unusable I am so relived I'd moved before upgrading to El Capitan.\nHope this helps.\n\nA: I've found, and am now loving, Royal TSX. Not only does it do exactly what I loved CoRD for - multiple RDP connections in a single window - it has a plugin system that'll connect to VNC, TeamViewer, web pages etc, and more in the future. The RDP plugin is based on FreeRDP, and seems to support the latest RDP protocol enhancements.\nSome of the functionality requires the companion server product, and it'll only do 10 connections in \"free\" mode ($29 for unlimited connections). But given that it's a stable, feature-rich client that is being actively developed, I can recommend it highly.\n\nA: I've had the same issues with Cord on El Capitan, I've been using the 14 day trial of Jump Desktop and it seems very nice and stable thus far.\n\nA: Jump Desktop is great and can sync nicely between your Mac and iDevices. Only problem is on the Mac it opens each desktop in a new window. As others have said, I much prefer the unified window. Anxious to try Royal TSX.\n", "Q: Does Apple Music let you hear the whole song on iPhone and iPad? (instead of just 30 seconds or 1:30 of sampling) After I started with the Apple Music 3-month trial, sometimes I search for a song on my iPhone, and I could actually hear the whole song.\nSo I thought Apple Music probably lets me hear the whole song for most or all of its songs, but there are other cases when I search for a song on my Macbook using iTunes, I could only hear the 30 second clip or 1.5 minute clip like before.\nSo what is the rule?  I could hear most (or all) the songs on iPhone and iPad for any song on iTunes Store, but not on  any Mac -- is this basically the rule for subscribers to Apple Music?\n\nA: I've never had a song not play through on iOS or OS X via Apple Music. My guess is network congestion is the culprit when you don't get a full play. \nAnother possibility is your iTunes account is in a geographical region where Apple Music doesnt have broad coverage of the songs in Apple's total catalog. In at case, those songs that are for sale somewhere in the world, but not in your region, might have previews instead of full plays. \nFor me in the us, Apple Music gives me all the music I care to consume for the subscription period across all decides that are signed your Apple ID. The notorious artists like Prince simply don't show up so I haven't found a song that' soft sale but not for streaming.\n", "Q: How do I put the dock on the top (external) monitor in a dual monitor setup? I have a dual monitor setup with a MacBook Pro (Retina) 13\" and 24\" external Dell monitor (via DVI). I am using the MBP as the bottom monitor of the setup, and want to be able to use it primarily for full screen app tasks. This means I find it more convenient to put the dock on the top screen, displaying all the time. However, OS X only displays it on the very bottom screen. \nI assume my goal ends up breaking Apple's mental model for how the dock (the dock attaching to a corner of the screen) works, which is why I haven't found a way to do this yet. \nAny ideas on how to make this dream happen? I've attached a screenshot of the arrangement of the monitors (from the OS X Display system preferences).\n\n\nA: Someone showed me one solution: there's a sort of \"shelf\" created where the bottom monitor is narrower than the top. If you move your mouse on the top monitor until it hits that shelf, the dock will pop up to the top monitor. However, if you move your mouse to the bottom of the bottom screen the dock will move back there. \nThis should be sufficient for my problem, but I'm leaving this up in case other people have alternative answers (and if this will be helpful for someone else).\n\n\nA: I use 2 monitors with extended display from my Macbook.  Looks like Mac is treating all displays combined as one.\nTo fix this frustrating problem for me, I've arranged the Macbook display on top of two external displays and bingo, that started showing the dock in one of the external displays as I'd expect. This way, even when you move the white bar to the top (Mac) to make it primary display, the dock remains at the bottom monitor (in this case it is the larger monitor).\n\n\nA: If you like to have your dock automatically hidden there's a problem with making it visible, to solve this try:\n\n*\n\n*Make top screen main screen as others suggested.\n\n*Use cmd + option + d to toggle the dock on the top of the screen.\n\n", "Q: El Capitan won't resume download Yesterday I downloaded El Capitan partly via the Appstore. I didn't have the time to finish the installation, so I cancelled the download. Today I want to resume, but the download buttons don't work, and in the update tab I see \"waiting...\" and a pause button that is greyed out. I restarted and tried again, but nothing changed.\nIs there a way to reset this installation or to resume it?\n\nA: Follow these steps\nApp Store > purchased > check for any unfinished apps that didn't finish downloading, in my case it was Yosemite, then just click download on the app that didn't finish downloading and all your other apps should start to download including OSX EL CAPITAN. Cheers\n", "Q: Logged into Facebook app on two phones I received a Facebook message on my phone B, but cleared the notification. I deleted the Facebook message on phone B. Will phone A still receive the notification even though I cleared everything quickly?\n\nA: You will receive the notification on all devices that have a connection and have notifications for Facebook enabled, regardless of whether you have since cleared the notification on another device. \n", "Q: Applescript Won't Invoke Shortcut Command I have a long TextEdit document I frequently open (via a keystroke, thanks to Alfred). It contains many non-standard spellings, so I de-select \"Check Spelling While Typing\" (though I want  spell checking to be default on with other TextEdit documents). Note that I've created the shortcut \"Command/Option/Control - S\" (in Prefs/Keyboard/Shortcuts) to toggle that command.\nTo save myself a step, I want to create an applescript to open the document and trigger that command. But I just can't make it work. \nThe document opens, but  \"Check Spelling While Typing\" won't toggle off.\ntell application \"Finder\"\nactivate\nopen document file \"reference.rtf\" of folder \"Documents\" of folder \"MYSTUFF\" of folder \"Users\" of startup disk\nend tell\n\ntell application \"TextEdit\" to activate\ntell application \"System Events\"\nkeystroke \"s\" using {command down, option down, control down}\nend tell\n\n==============\nEDIT:\nI've inserted \"Delay\", but that doesn't help; the spellings are highlighted.\nIs it possible Applescripts for some reason can't invoke custom shortcuts within applications (that have been rigged up via Prefs/Keyboard/Shortcuts)? \nIs there another way to invoke the \"Check Spelling While Typing\" command? It doesn't seem to be one of TextEdit's scriptable commands.\n\nA: I suspect it wasn't accepting the custom shortcut because the shortcut's solely used in TextEdit, whereas the script was sending it to System Events.\nWhether that's true or not, the following script works. It chooses the menu item rather than triggering it via shortcut:\ntell application \"Finder\"\nactivate\nopen document file \"reference.rtf\" of folder \"Documents\" of folder \"MYSTUFF\" of folder \"Users\" of startup disk\nend tell\ndelay 1\nactivate application \"TextEdit\"\ndelay 1\ntell application \"System Events\"\ntell process \"TextEdit\"\n\n\nclick menu item \"Check Spelling While Typing\" of menu 1 of menu item \"Spelling and Grammar\" of menu 1 of menu bar item \"Edit\" of menu bar 1\n\nend tell\nend tell\n\n\nA: Note added after comments...\nIt may not be the delay that is causing the issue - it looks more likely to be the difficulty in determining the initial state of the auto-check switch.  \n\nI do think 'delay' is your actual issue, as Arthur mentioned, but you can hone that script down to 3 lines, even adding the delay\nIf you're running from HD rather than SSD, you may need to lift the delay value to 2 or 3, just to give the document time to open & come to the front.\ntell application \"Finder\" to open file ((path to documents folder as text) & \"reference.rtf\")\ndelay 1\ntell application \"System Events\" to keystroke \"s\" using {command down, option down, control down}\n\nI'm assuming your users/mystuff/Documents path is your regular ~/Documents folder with the account name changed. My new version doesn't rely on your user name being in the script, it will just use the current user's ~/Documents folder\n\nA: I'm adding this as a second answer, as I think the research in getting here is worth keeping in the flow.\nUsing a lot of Google-Fu & Apple's own UI helper, UIElementInspector, which I obtained via FDMlib (which links directly to Apple for the download) I managed to cobble this together...\ntell application \"Finder\" to open file ((path to documents folder as text) & \"reference.rtf\")\ndelay 1\n\ntell application \"System Events\" to tell process \"TextEdit\"\n    set v to (value of attribute \"AXMenuItemMarkChar\" of menu item \"Check Spelling While Typing\" of menu 1 of menu item \"Spelling and Grammar\" of menu 1 of menu bar item \"Edit\" of menu bar 1)\n\n    if v = \"✓\" then\n        click menu item \"Check Spelling While Typing\" of menu 1 of menu item \"Spelling and Grammar\" of menu 1 of menu bar item \"Edit\" of menu bar 1\n    end if\nend tell\n\nThe 'set v to...' is the part that examines the current toggle state of that menu item. It's a bit rough & ready, but it works by checking for the actual checkmark on the menu item itself. If it's not checked it does nothing, if it is, it hands over to be switched off.  \nI'm sure a proper scripter could refine this in a dozen ways - but it works :-)\n", "Q: How do I get x360ce to work in Wine on OS X? I am having trouble getting x360ce to work with Wine and cooperate with my Steam game, specifically Rivals of Aether. I purchased a Mayflash GameCube Controller Adapter for Wii U & PC USB to be able to use my original GameCube controller on my Macbook Pro 13\" retina display laptop. I have used Parallels and managed to get Steam and x360ce to work in that, but I feel that having the the entire VM running to play this one game is unnecessary, and also feel that using Wine would be a simpler and lighter way to play the game. \nI have searched Google and Reddit for answers, but they have mostly been answers for Windows, Linux or Abuntu users.\nSo far I have referenced these for information:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://askubuntu.com/posts/399662/revisions \n\n*https://www.reddit.com/r/RivalsOfAether/comments/3mlsv8/guide_getting_roa_working_on_os_x/\nFor the first one, I can't get past step 7 because I am not entirely sure of how to run the x360ce.exe...\nI'm new to the Macintosh platform and need a lot of help  as you can see lol. If anyone could guide me towards the right direction or share some better suggestion for an application that will be able to read my GameCube Controller through wine, it would be much appreciated.\nThank you! \n\nA: I'm assuming you could click on package contents on the wrapper you have now made and click wine, then go to install software, and etc. to run x360ce.exe. You then could have the file moved to the right location mentioned in the x360ce guide. Haven't attempted this yet though, but if this doesn't work out, you could always button map using enjoyable, the second guide has explains how to do that.

Anyone knows what are these related to (and maybe what program usually create them) and whether it is safe to remove them? \nI'm using Mac OS 10.8.5 if it can be useful.\n\nA: .cups is used by Common Unix Printing System, as the name insinuates, this is used by the printing system. \nI believe that the .jssc is created by the java simple serial connector library. My bet is you have some java application that uses this library. I wouldn't worry about it. \n", "Q: MagSafe 85W weight I wonder if the weight of a MagSafe 85W adapter could be an indicator about whether it is genuine or counterfeit. I bought an adapter that weighs about 210 grams, whereas my old one (broken) weighs a little more, 230 grams.\nI measured the weight with a kitchen scale, without the power cable attached (i.e. only the adapter) and with the cable connecting to the computer on the ground, such that it's (for the very most part) not included in the weighting.\n\nA: In short, you won't be able to prove it unless you had someone familiar enough with counterfeits to notice.\nIf genuine, it is possible that the power supplies are built by different manufacturers, or, as you've noted, that they have been changed (indicated by the different style of Magsafe connectors) which could have resulted in changes internally to the product. I doubt there is an official standard for these that would rule out a variance of 20g, unfortunately. This can be inferred by the following statement from Apple:\n\nA replacement adapter may not be the same size, color, shape, or\n  wattage as the original adapter that came with your computer. It\n  should however power and charge your Mac like the adapter that\n  originally came with your computer.\nSource: Apple\n\nTypically, a genuine Apple adapter would have the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Apple logo recessed into both sides of the adapter\n\n*A serial # for the adapter located below the metal plug used to grip the adapter head on the charger body\n\n*Regulatory, trademark, and other information on the \"bottom\" side of the adapter\n\n\nHowever, the above can all be easily faked. Unless you can easily tell that the build quality is suspect, generally the only way you'll know if it is a real adapter is if you buy it directly from Apple.\n\nA: You propose an interesting data set that I have not yet found elsewhere, so I'll contribute my measurements:\nMy genuine magsafe 2 85W charger (included with macbook pro purchase from Apple store):\n315 g = body + US two-prong wall adapter + charging cable\n297 g = body + charging cable\n259 g = body only (charging cable resting on ground)\nMy recent replacement purchase from Other World Computing (which they've told me twice is ordered in bulk direct from Apple):\n261 g = body + US two-prong wall adapter + charging cable\n244 g = body + charging cable\n216 g = body only (charging cable resting on ground)\nBoth are manufactured by Liteon Technology Corporation and say 2012 (c) on the side.\nThat's significant variation between my two chargers. So either the OWC one is fake, or Apple chargers vary significantly, or they somehow get heavier with age?\nCarl\n\nA: My 2015 A1424 Mag2 charger that came with the MacBook Pro 13 weight is a similar 320 g.  The charger's manufacturing date is 2015.\n\nA: Too light or too heavy an adapter is a very good sign it’s not genuine.\nNothing stops a clever counterfeiter from adding weights to a light knock off to defeat this countermeasure, though.\n", "Q: Now that El Capitan is \"rootless\", is there any way to get dtrace working? I've found dtrace to be an invaluable tool for debugging and troubleshooting all sorts of issues, not to mention the two dozen dtrace toolkit scripts shipped by Apple as part of El Capitan.\nOn El Cap though, running dtrace usually results in an endless spew of errors making dtrace all but useless.\n\nA: Copy the binary to a directory that is not \"restricted\", for example, /tmp\ncsrutil disable does not work for dtruss to some degree.

Instead the consist of a cryptic combination of numbers and characters. Maybe that was the cause why Mail did not import anything.\nMy guess is, that accounts are now referenced by a number/character-code out of security reasons. However, that leaves me wondering how to do a proper backup of mail for a clean install.\n\nA: What you should do is go to the V3 folder go to Maildata.Open the folder and remove all items except for syncedrules.plist Than close mail and reopen it.

In the past, Apple has focused on reliability for newer models and then subsequently released a X.1 version with under-the-hood work done for older devices. So it wouldn't surprise me if it is a deeper problem. \nTwo simple things to try right off would be a hard reboot of the device if you haven't already. You can do that by holding the home and power button down until you see the Apple logo. Also, make sure that you are on the latest version of iOS. iOS 9.0.2 is out now, so update and hopefully that will solve your issue.\nIf that doesn't work, you have to take it up a notch. You could try resetting all preferences to see if that solves the problem. Go to Settings - General - Reset - Erase all Settings to perform that function. If that doesn't work, the other main thing to try would be to restore the phone. Make sure you have a backup (I always like to have two), wipe the device, then restore. \n\nA: It seems like soft resetting the iPhone is the only way to restore the symbol. I have an iPhone 5 too, and also have this problem. \nI am able to connect to the router and can even browse the internet with my data service disabled from my carrier's end, but it still shows up as 3g or lte in place of the wifi symbol. \nAs stated before, the wifi assist which is turned on by default was turned off by me. \nMight try a reset but not sure if I want to put that much effort into this. It appears to be using wifi data rather than cell data after all. It's just confusing to know which I'm connected to at a glance without going into the settings ño double check every time. \n\nA: A hard reset worked for me.  I was not showing the icon on 5S but wifi was working.\n", "Q: Can I run a virtualized OS X operating system (bought on eBay) on my PC via VMware Player I am considering running a virtualized OS X running system within my PC on VMware Player. I want to do this so that I can run Xcode.\nCan I do this?\n\nA: Actually, it's a complicated little issue. While it isn't supported by Apple's Terms and Agreement, it is possible to run Mac OS X in VMware. However, you would need an unlocker of some sort, that provides a copy of Darwin.iso, and a few other tools for debugging and overall performance on virtual hardware. From there, you would then need to modify VMware as well (also done via an unlocker), seeing that it doesn't support Apple software by default. It's also noted that using an AMD cpu/apu will require additional kexts and verbose-mode commands during boot-time to run properly. When this is all handled, you should be able to run almost any version of Mac OS X, as demonstrated here (in fact, I'm currently using this vm on an Intel Core i5 to post this answer online - for testing purposes):\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-r8CvCnen4\nIn fact, this exact video uses VMware Player. I haven't gotten this to work for Workstation 12 (after weeks of debugging and trial-and-error), so I would assume that there is a compatibility issue with Workstation in the current version.\nWARNING: I do not endorse the misuse of Apple products. I am simply answering a question from knowledge and experience, to correct a widely-supported assumption that is untrue.\nAs such, yes - it is possible. But NO, you should not do this for anything beyond testing purposes (even if it is FREE with an AppleID).\n", "Q: How to edit many lines at once in TextMate?

Overriding the EXTENSION_DIR on the fly. \nIt took a little trial and error but when you're ready to actually perform the install after phpizing (is that a word?) simply make the directory:\nmkdir -p /usr/local/lib/php/extensions\n\nAnd then run:\n./configure\n\nmake\n\nsudo make EXTENSION_DIR='/usr/local/lib/php/extensions' install\n\nNow that the extension is placed in a non-protected directory you just have to update your php.ini to point to the extension with the full path.\nextension=/usr/local/lib/php/extensions/mcrypt.so\n\n\nA: El Capitan adds a new security feature named System Integrity Protection (SIP). Among other things, SIP prevents parties other than Apple from adding, deleting or modifying directories and files stored in certain directories:\n/bin\n/sbin\n/usr\n/System\n\nApple has indicated that the following directories are available for developers to access:\n/usr/local\n/Applications\n/Library\n~/Library\n\nAll directories in /usr except for /usr/local are protected by SIP.\nFor more information on SIP, please see this post:\nhttps://derflounder.wordpress.com/2015/10/01/system-integrity-protection-adding-another-layer-to-apples-security-model/\n\nA: Yes, this is due to SIP. So the two options you have are\n\n\n*\n\n*disable SIP entirely \n\n*raise a defect/support request against mcrypt to use /usr/local instead of /usr for installation\n\n\nA: There is no need to disable System Integrity Protection to install php extensions.

I haven't been able to find a definite answer to this question. \nI've upgraded my iOS devices to v9.0 and in both of them iOS \"Documents and Data\" is nowhere to be found. I got the prompt to upgrade to iCloud Drive, which I didn't do (*). When I installed iOS 8, I also didn't update and things worked as they did before. \nNow I seem to be stuck in a weird limbo as Documents don't sync via iCloud but I haven't been able to find any definite answer on whether this is by design (I find it quite surprising as it's a bit of nowhere land).

One weird exception to this was the iPhone 6 and 6+. These devices did not have this compatibility mode, so it was iCloud Drive or nothing.\nOS X Yosemite (10.10) also does not have the same compatibility mode though, so unless iCloud Drive was enabled, there is no document syncing. The same goes for OS X El Capitan (10.11). \nI expect that the iOS 8 compatibility was only included to fill the gap between the time iOS 8 and OS X Yosemite shipped, so I cannot imagine that iOS 9 would be compatible with the old-iCloud in any way.\nAlso note that \"iCloud\" is a collection of different technologies under the surface, so things like Contacts and Calendar may be able to sync without iCloud Drive enabled on all devices, but most other apps will need it enabled.\n", "Q: Bash command to calculate average on each row and each column Suppose we have a log file like marks.log and the content looks something like this:\nFname   Lname   Net Algo    \nJack    Miller  15  20  \nJohn    Compton 12  20  \nSusan   Wilson  13  19  \n\nI want to add a new column that contains average for each person (row), and a new row that contains average for each course (column).

My favorite is its file system explorer which gives you a tree of the local filesystem, and you can point and click on any file at load it into the main editor.\nI'm looking for the closest thing in Mac-land. On my machine there is only TextEdit, which seems OK, but I can't find a \"raw text\" mode that prevents me from pasting in HTML or other kind of markup.\nAnything close to this?\n\nA: I use these two text editors and I think both are pretty good:\n\n\n*\n\n*Sublime Text: Although it's not \"free\", it lets you use it for trial indefinitely.

If you have brew installed you can:\nbrew install openssl libyaml libffi\n\n\nA: Installation of John The Ripper on Catalina, as Silver was saying:\ngit clone https://github.com/magnumripper/JohnTheRipper jumbo\ncd jumbo/src\n\nThan I had the same problem at author of the post, and solved it with the following command:\nmake -s clean && make -sj4\n\nAt this stage I had a problem because of the ar / ran library (for some reason Homebrew changed the default PATH, I solved the issue by moving the rogue folder altogether), \nsudo mv /usr/local/Cellar/cctools/855/bin/ranlib /opt/local/bin/ranlib-backup-2020-03-24\nsudo mv /usr/local/Cellar/cctools/855/bin/ar /opt/local/bin/ar-backup-2020-03-24\n\nYou will find the specific location of your \"rogue ar / ranlib\" folder from your logs if you have a problem.\nAt this point I just launched:\n../run/john --test=0\n\nAnd boom it works.\nAfter the installation I had another major problem, a perl related one concerning the Lzma package, if you have the same problem this four lines of code solved it for me:\nsudo cpan Compress::Raw::Lzma\ncpan Compress::Raw::Lzma\nsudo cpan IO::Compress::Lzma\ncpan IO::Compress::Lzma\n\n", "Q: Is there a user font for San Francisco in El Capitan? I thought the new Apple font was called San Francisco, but I cannot find it in the font list of the Keynote.app for my Mac. Is it called another way or it is not available for Keynote?\nI am currently using OS X El Capitan.\n\nA: They are System fonts & not available (or indeed licensed) for documents that you make or App use in general.\nAs mentioned in comments, even the developer version of the fonts is only licensed for interface mockups & no other purpose.\nThe previous system font, Helvetica Neue, on the other hand, was released as both a System & User font.\nThere are various opinions online about how to make the San Fransisco fonts available to the user, but seem to depend on unpacking the individual ttfs, changing the 'system font' attribute, then repacking them again - something I'll leave to someone else, regardless of the licensing or legal position of doing that.\n\nA: Actually, just convert all the SFNS*.otf font in /System/Library/Fonts/ to ttf and install them to ~/Library/Fonts/. That will work fine.\nEDIT : Apparently, it's working only for Pages, Keynote and Numbers under the name \"System Font\". Can't get it to work on other programs.\n", "Q: What is the function of the triangles and circles that appear in the ruler when working with text in Keynote? I just discovered that two downward-facing triangles appear whenever I'm working with a text object in keynote; those serve to define the initial and final tabs. But I noticed that clicking on the ruler between these triangles creates additional shapes (left and right-facing triangles, a rhombus/diamond, and a circle). I've tried moving them around, but I haven't seen any change in the text. Maybe I don't know how to insert proper tabs while I'm typing. Any ideas?\n\n\nA: The outer two are Margin guides [the edge of the printing area], the inner ones are Tab-stops; Markers that text & numbers will line up to if you separate them by using the Tab key instead of just some spaces.\n\nThe orange lines are mine, for illustration.\n'Right tab' in the picture unfortunately has an accidental space after it, which stops it lining up with the orange line properly - my bad - but it illustrates that the space itself is included in the tab-stop.\nYou can see & edit a Tab function by right clicking a Tab marker...\n\nBTW, if there's not enough room for the tabs, compared to the typed text, they simply don't [can't] work.\nOne last note - Tabs are set for that line only unless specified globally before you start typing, or if you Select All.\n", "Q: In Numbers, how can I sum only if adjacent cell is certain value?

If not can I clean install Yosemite from a USB stick made for another machine? I've got several computers that I manage. Last week just before the release of El Capitan I upgraded one of them to Yosemite; I now want to upgrade the rest to Yosemite (the reason I'm not going straight to El Capitan is that a core piece of daily software I use doesn't work with it yet).\nThe other machines I want to upgrade are all currently running 10.8.x (not sure what version but it's the latest).\nIs it possible to still download a copy of Yosemite to install? \nI've also got a copy of Yosemite saved to a USB stick that I used for the clean install of one of the computers. Could I just use this to clean install Yosemite onto the other computers? The first computer I used this on was an MBP late 2012 going from 10.9 to 10.10 while the other computers are a mixture of Mac Minis and MBPs going from 10.8 to 10.10. Would they need a different version of Yosemite to install or is it all the same version?\n\nA: You should be able to download Yosemite from the App store if you login with an account that had previously acquired it.\nIf the USB stick was made with an App store copy of \"Install OS X Yosemite.app\", it will work on any hardware that existed prior to the release of the copy you downloaded. \n\nA: Just use the USB (unless you have very fast internet). If you do download them, you'll need to be logged into the same Apple ID on the Mac App Store. Then you can go to purchased and download the installer.\nEdit: the USB will work on all machines compatible with 10.10. If you use it, you do not need to clean install it. Just running the installer will be the same as downloading & running it from the MAS.\n\nA: It's not possible to download OS X Yosemite installer app from App Store any more. The latest OS X which is available at the moment is El Capitan.\nIf you had previously created Yosemite USB drive, just use it.\n", "Q: How can I change a command and cursor key bindings globally?

Similarly for cmd→ and alt→ as well. How can I accomplish this?\n\nA: To swap the key bindings download, install and start Karabiner.\nOpen the menulet Karabiner -> Preferences... in the menubar, search for arrow and enable the swapping of the two command like in the example below (FYI KeyRemap4MacBook shown in the screenshot is the predecessor of Karabiner):\n\n", "Q: El Capitan not grouping Mail duplicates In earlier Versions of Apple Mail if there are multiple mails of the same content, i.e. in Inbox and in Sent, Mail would show \"1 duplicate\" in the upper right. This seems to be gone in El Capitan Mail 9. Now there are multiple Mails with exact same content (Cmd-Shift-D) but sent to different addresses next to each other in the Sent folder. How can I set Mail back to show them as duplicates?\n\nA: Here's the link to the discussion about it. https://discussions.apple.com/message/29070991#29070991\nIt has been modified to group only messages in that actual conversation and the feature we all loved is now gone.\n", "Q: Listen to music while watching videos on the browser How can I listen to music from the Music app or others (Spotify, etc…) while browsing with Safari? I know that I can put Music in background but it stops whenever I start watching video on Safari. Can I turn off any audio from Safari? Is there any alternative browser that has this feature?\n\nA: Two apps can't play media at the same time. It's not that Safari is preventing the music from being played but that the media player playing the video from Safari is the front-most media player, overriding any background music. Thus, you can't 'turn off' audio from Safari because it's not from Safari.\n", "Q: Restore photos from old iPhoto library backup to new Mac Photos app I've old backup from my MacBook (2008-2010) iPhoto library on external HD, i wish to browse + select photos and merge them with my current iMac Photos app in El Capitan 10.11 \n\nA: I had the same problem. You've got to do:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open PHOTOS while pressing OPTION key. Choose form a list your old\niPhoto library. Either Photos will convert the old file or will\ndirect you to a link on Apple where you can download an utility that\nwill convert the file for you.\n\n*In any case you will have to repeat and open Photos with option key pressed. Choose the converted file.\n\n*Once it is opened you have to select all photos and EXPORT them to a folder in your desktop.\n\n*Then you go through your filtering. After having all the photos you want in a folder, reopen Photos with the option key pressed. But now choose your regular Photo Library.\n\n*Then you IMPORT the photos from the folder.\n\n*In case you need the convertion utility from Apple, here is the link:\nhttps://support.apple.com/pt-br/HT202358 . (It did not work for me. I think El capitan doesn't like these old utilities - from 2013.)\n\n\nHope you succeed.\n", "Q: Motion tracking no longer working on 6S I recently purchased an iPhone 6S, and the motion tracking worked for a few days, but then in the past four days it has recorded no steps or flights climbed. This morning, the phone started recording data again, but only briefly (maybe 2 hours); it currently is not collecting any motion data. I've been using Apple's Health app and the FitBit app. I tried turning motion tracking off and then back on, restarted the phone, no luck. I'm on iOS 9.0.2. Any ideas?\n\nA: Try restarting your iPhone by holding the lock button and home button together until you see an Apple logo appear. If that doesn't work, I'd attribute that issue to a bug. The iPhone 6S is kind of buggy, mine won't play system or Taptic Feedback sounds sometimes. So we may just have to wait for software updates.\n", "Q: Using a wireless mouse with an iPad I need to use my iPad mini as a computer for a while. I am planning to use an Apple TV to AirPlay mirror my iPad's display to an existing HD monitor through HDMI, but I need a good input method. I am A LOT more productive and faster using a mouse, and I only really need a web browser.\nI have found that Puffin Browser might have something similar to what I need, namely, it has a \"virtual trackpad,\" where it puts a cursor on the screen and you can swipe around in a small rectangle to move and click the cursor on the page. This is all well and good, but I would need some way of using a physical, Bluetooth mouse somehow like this. Any ideas?\n\nA: You have to hurdles to overcome: \n\n\n*\n\n*Apple's operating system does not pair with Bluetooth mice. You need to overcome that to use a mouse. \n\n*Apple's operating system is designed for multitouch as opposed to a single pointer, each application that you use will need to handle the mouse input and juggle it with other multitouch inputs. \n\n\nYou can review other people's failure to use a mouse with iOS on these questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Using mouse from OSX host on iOS device\n\n*How do I hover on the iPad?\nBasically keyboards and stylus are supported. Mice and trackpads are not currently. \n", "Q: How to change a key combination without using Karabiner? I have used Karabiner to change a key combination but the problem is, it doesn't work exactly as I want.\nFor example, using Karabiner, I have mapped alt← to cmd← and vice versa. But what Karabiner does is, it \"tricks\" the OS to make it think that I have pressed alt←, whenever I press cmd←.\nThis isn't the behaviour I want. The behaviour I want is, whenever I press cmd<-, I want the system to think that I have indeed pressed cmd←, but instead of moving the cursor to the beginning of the line, I want it to move it to the previous word.\nIt is possible to do this maybe messing with some system files and stuff?\n\nA: You can change the text editing bindings for Cocoa apps with DefaultKeyBinding.dict. This will work for almost all applications where the ⌘ command+← left and ⌘ command+→ right worked before. (The only way it wouldn't work is if the application creator reimplemented those shortcuts from scratch, which is doubtful as it would be much easier to just use the versions that come free with a textfield.)\n\n\n*\n\n*If the directory ~/Library/KeyBindings/ does not exist, create it.\n\n*Create the file DefaultKeyBinding.dict in that directory with contents like this:\n{\n    \"@\\Uf702\" = moveWordBackward:;\n    \"@\\Uf703\" = moveWordForward:;\n    \"~\\Uf702\" = moveToBeginningOfLine:;\n    \"~\\Uf703\" = moveToEndOfLine:;\n}\n\nThe @ refers to the Command key, ~ is Option, \\Uf702 is Left, and \\Uf703 is Right. The selectors on the right-hand side are the same ones used in the default file, /System/Library/Frameworks/AppKit.framework/Resources/StandardKeyBinding.dict, but switched around to match what you said in your question.\n\n*Restart an application for the changes to take effect in it.\nHere's an in-depth guide to the Cocoa Text System that should help explain what's going on.\n", "Q: My native mac apps are not connecting to the internet, but Google Chrome does and works correctly.

Have always used a NAS for Time Machine to back-up but not doing anything offsite. \nNot sure what to do to move these libraries or archive them to a) an external HD or b) an offsite storage. Is it possible to just \"close\" the library and move it to an external HD for archiving. From what I understand in iPhoto/iMovie, if you wanted to access that library later you could simply load that library. \nIs there any how-to on this or a better method? Also moving forward should I be keeping the libraries on an external an just accessing them with Photos/iMovie?\n\nA: Yes, it is possible to just close the libraries and move them to an external HD. This will take long time to copy across (leave it overnight) but will work.\nMoving them to an offsite solution is not supported by iPhotos/Photos/iMovie and so your mileage may vary. There are some third party software solutions that can help with the management of large libraries. Bear in mind that something cloud-based will be very much slower to access unless it also uses local disk space - which was what you were trying to avoid. It's great for offsite backup, but not for browsing, editing, etc.\nAfter you've moved to the external hard drive, if you then run iPhoto/Photos while holding the ALT/option key, you can choose to create a new library to start fresh. We do this on Jan 1 each year and put the whole year of photos and videos in one library so that it keeps to a manageable size.\n", "Q: Calendar view in iPad Mini running iOS 9 I can't seem to adjust my calendar view to see 5 days under the week view with my iPad Mini running iOS 9.  How do I change the setup?  I don't see an option in settings.\n\nA: The few things you can change in the native calendar app are under settings at the bottom of Mail, Contacts, Calendars:\n\nYou would need to download a custom calendar app to change the week view of your calendar data. The best I can manage is changing the week start date, which changes things everywhere.\n", "Q: How to make Kindle Preview run on El Capitain Installed Kindle Previewer v2.94 but it doesn't open, just crashes without even an error message.\ntried to solve using this blog's instructions\nbut it didn't worked out.\n\nA: I found this works \n(from Apple's Java support note )\n1) Download and install X11\nhttps://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac\n2) Download and install Java for OSX\nhttps://support.apple.com/kb/DL1572?locale=en_US\n3)\nfinder>applications>(right click) kindle previewer.app>show package contents>contents>macos>\n(Right click) Launcher>open with> other, choose textedit, then enter the following and save\n#!/bin/sh\n\nexport JAVA_HOME=\"/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/1.6.0.jdk/Contents/Home\"\n\ndir=`dirname \"$0\"`\ncd \"$dir\"\nclasspath=./:./lib/touchLibs/etc/fonts/fonts\n\nfor i in `ls ./lib`\ndo\nclasspath=$classpath:./lib/$i\ndone\n\nexport DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=.\n\n# start the previewer\nfileExtT=`echo $1 | awk -F.

We should wait a patch.\n\n\nA: The cause could be lots and lots of things. Let's first narrow down some items. Open Activity Monitor and check other tasks, check memory pressure then disconnect from the network. (That last step helps isolate the system).\n\n\n*\n\n*Reboot and check Activity Monitor again. Is it worse or better on RAM and CPU. Also consider snapping a picture so you see all the items using CPU and show all processes.\n\n*Make a new user account, log out of your user and in to the new user. Note if CPU is better or worse.\n\n*Reboot into safe mode (hold shift when you hear the startup chime) - this eliminates some software and all third party plug-ins.\n\n\n\n\nA: Quit Pathfinder if you have it installed and running.\nAfter upgrading to El Capitan I had the same problem.  Finder CPU usage climbs quickly to ~110% when Pathfinder is running.  No CPU issue if Pathfinder is stopped.  Waiting for El Capitan support for Pathfinder from Cocoatech.\n\nA: Looking at this Apple forum thread, the first solution was this:\n\nA first guess is: bad com.apple.finder.plist file in ~/Library/Preferences/. Delete the file.\n\nHere was another that seemed to help:\n\nI solved this issue by setting my finder preferences for \"New Finder window show:\"  to my home folder... My issue was that it was defaulting to \"All My Files\"--- that caused finder to scan everything, images, thumbnails, etc and get up over 100% of cpu usage.\n\n\nA: The problem appears to not be limited to specific apps. Personally, I often see Finder using 100% cpu, but Matlab, Lyx, Chrome and other programs have displayed similar behavior, although not as often. This indicates that it might be related to accessing the hdd or navigating the file system generally. I know that El Capitan has changed something about how programs are allowed to access system folders because it has forced a fundamental change in how LaTeX works. \n\nA: For me the solution was turning off \"Calculate all sizes\" in Finder; the setting that lets you show how big folders are. This instantly dropped the CPU usage without needing a restart. I had no luck with deleting the Finder plist and I didn't get round to resetting the SMC or PRAM.\n\nA: I've isolated the problem that when I am connected to WiFi or Ethernet the CPU becomes overwhelmed. I'm running El Capitan just now and testing with no apps launched, all third party background apps killed in activity monitor. Just bare system with Ethernet now back running. My CPU seems to be stable now at 95% idle.I will methodically add back the system to see if I can determine the culprit. My advice is to first disconnect from the network, restart, and see if CPU stabilizes……then you can troubleshoot from there.\n", "Q: In Yosemite, can you \"un tag\" more than 10 files at once? The tags replaced labels in Yosemite.\nLabels could be added or removed whatever the number of files selected, and could not be combined.\nTags are another story, since you can combine them.\nBut if you select:\nFILE-1 and FILE-2 etc all the way to FILE-20,\nthen add a tag to them, and if you do not deselect the 20 files, and go back to the File menu, in order to remove the green tag, you cannot \"remove tag\" on these 20 files the way it worked before (say, with labels, before Yosemite, when you would remove label on 1-∞ files at once).\nIt doesn't work over 10 files the way it would work if only 1-10 files were selected. Remove tag doesn't work for over 10 files.\nVisual explanation of the problem:\nOne file is selected then \"add green tag\" appears as an option in the Finder:\n\n\nThe green tag is added:\n\nWhile this one file is selected, \"add green tag\" becomes \"remove green tag\" in the File menu of the Finder (or \"remove tag \"green\"\", which isn't proper English, but whatever):\n\nNow I select 30 files without any tags:\n\nand \"add green tag\" to them (notice how now all the tag circles are strangely circled with a white stroke, by the way, not sure what that's supposed to mean to the user):\n\nGreen tags gets added to 30 files without a problem:\n\nNow I am looking for the \"remove green tag\" option for these files, but the Finder asks me if I want to \"add tag green\" to these files:\n\nIf I \"add tag green\" of course nothing happens, since you can only attribute one green tag once to each file, and this has already been done once. Neither does this remove the tag.\nIt seems that it would make sense if the command displayed said \"remove all green tags in selection\", but that's not the case.\nI can now only de-tag my files by groups of 10 files.If I select 10 of them, then \"remove green tag\" in the File menu works...\nTherefore, if you inadvertently tag 1503 files in one clumsy gesture, and do not have access to the Edit -> Undo \"add tag green\" command, how would you select all 1503 files to remove their tags in one single move instead of 150?\n\nA: You can do this using the Edit Tags button as seen in the screenshot. Just delete the tag of the selected files from the typing field.\n\n", "Q: Upgrading brew in El Capitan I just upgraded to El Capitan, and when I tried updating brew I got the following error:\n$ brew update\nError: The /usr/local directory is not writable.\nEven if this directory was writable when you installed Homebrew, other\nsoftware may change permissions on this directory. Some versions of the\n\"InstantOn\" component of Airfoil are known to do this.\n\nYou should probably change the ownership and permissions of /usr/local\nback to your user account.\n  sudo chown -R $(whoami):admin /usr/local\n\nBefore I proceed with the chown recommendation, given that El Capitan just came out, is that the right way to proceed here? Why is this step necessary, and what are any potential undesirable consequences of running this command?\nIn case it helps, I found two issues about El Capitan in brew: 40837 and 41665 but a solution to this problem wasn't immediately clear. What can I do to continue to use brew in El Capitan reliably?\n\nA: We no longer need to break our heads about this. I risked the advice and did the suggested permission change. Then, on updating to the latest homebrew I got this reassuring message:\n\nHomebrew no longer needs to have ownership of /usr/local. If you wish you can return /usr/local to its default ownership with:\n    sudo chown root:wheel /usr/local\n\n\nA: Per some of the security questions above, the dialog does give instructions to reset after a successful brew update. After running\nsudo chown -R $(whoami) /usr/local\n\nAnd then\nbrew update\n\nAfter the update has successfully run, the dialog should indicate doing this:\nsudo chown root:wheel /usr/local\n\nAfter that has been run, that should alleviate any security concerns with MacOS 10.12\n\nA: The given solution did not work for me:\nsudo chown -R $(whoami):admin /usr/local\nThis variation worked for me:\nsudo chown -R $USER /usr/local/\n\nA: I mean they give you the solution right there. I had the same problem and I just ran:\n  sudo chown -R $(whoami):admin /usr/local\n\nand it worked.\n\nA: I fix it by use this command sudo chown -R admin /usr/local.\n\nA: the system integrity protection needs to be disabled.\nYou can do it with this.\nsudo nvram boot-args=\"rootless=0\";osascript -e 'tell app \"loginwindow\" to «event aevtrrst»’\n\nThis disables System Integrity Protection system wide. I believe you can also do it from the Recovery Mode. You still have to type in your root password when doing things with sudo, but you aren't locked out by SIP. You also don't then go opening up directories inadvertently trying to set permissions.\n\nA: please look at the SIP with : \ncsrutil status\n\nthe system integrity protection is fixed at \"enable\", with the last Apple attribute 'restricted\": \ncsrutil \n\n\nA: It worked for me.\nsudo chgrp -R admin /usr/local\nsudo chmod -R g+w /usr/local\n\n", "Q: How do I download facetime on my first generation iPad I have version 5.1.1 iPad.

Actually the image shows up better in MsWord: here it is blurry\n\nHowever it is much worse in PowerPoint when pasted either from (a) the clipboard or (b) first to Word, copy into clipboard again and then paste into Powerpoint: in fact it is truncated\n\nSo .. what is the deal with pasting to PowerPoint ?  I am using PP for Mac 2011 v 14.1.\n\nA: It seems there were a  toolbar at the bottom of the screen that only shows up after you click once on the (messed up) screenshot and has an impressively unhelpful default value set.  Below I show having finally randomly clicked on the correct icon:\n\nNow why the picture would not be already sized properly .. well we can (un)-thank the PP designers for that.\n", "Q: Can I use Split View on an older iPad model? I can use Slide Over, but not Split View. Can I modify any plist files or do something in order to be able to use it on my iPad mini 2? \n\nA: There's really nothing that you can do to change that. iOS is not open-source, so users can't change source code. But it's also hardware limitations, so even if you were to find a way to force Split View multitasking into your iPad Mini, there's no telling what would happen. Apps would likely randomly crash, if they were even to open in the first place. Apple does a great job of supporting older hardware, so if Split View was feasible to implement on older iPads, Apple probably would have done it.\n\nA: Install Medusa tweak from Cydia and you will get real splitview multitasking.\n", "Q: Apple Remote Desktop - Reports Battery Percentage or Battery Hrs Left With Apple Remote Desktop, how can I generate a Battery Status Hrs Left or Battery Percentage Left on my Mac Laptop(s)?\nI did find something that tells me the \"Battery Charge Remaining (mAh)\", but it give me a number that I do not understand, example: 646.\nCan I have the percentage left instead or hours will be fine too?\nThank you so much and have a wonderful day.\nFabio\n\nA: The \"Battery Charge Remaining (mAh)\" field in Apple Remote Desktop's Reports function indicates the remaining milliamp hours of the battery.\nTo find the battery percentage, you can use \"Send UNIX Command\" to remotely execute the following command:\npmset -g batt\n\nThe output is the percentage and status of the battery, including the estimated time until it will be fully discharged, for example:\n51%; discharging; 3:24 remaining present: true\n\n", "Q: Old Mac Pro starts randomly hanging - how do I figure out what's wrong? I have a 2006 era Mac Pro I've been using as a file server.  It's running Lion Server, the latest version, and all software is up to date.  There's very little installed on it beyond the OS.\nWhen I boot it up it runs fine for some random amount of time, then it freezes.  It is headless but I have left screen sharing attached and can confirm that it's not crashing, it just stops responding.\nI've got a copy of the system log and there's nothing out of the ordinary in it.  Of course the log is full of errors, as they always are, but nothing is jumping out at me.  The last line before most of the freezes is\nSep 16 19:16:59 mastiff servermgrd[81]: No requests in 300 seconds, shutting down\nBut from what I can see in Google that's not likely to be causing the problem.\nUnfortunately with it being headless I can't watch it boot, so I'm not seeing the boot messages. It's so old I don't have a monitor that will connect to it.\nI need suggestions as to how to figure out what's really wrong, so I can determine if it's possible to fix.  Thanks in advance!\n\nA: Is Lion Server a fresh install, or is it updated from a prior OS? My suspicion is that you're likely suffering from a hardware issue (the only times I've experienced that sort of problem, HW was the culprit), but your first step is to get it running as vanilla as possible and see if you're still having the issue. \nBest bet is borrow a monitor, run diagnostics on the boot drive (make sure the drive isn't dying and the culprit), wipe the drive and install the OS fresh. Confirm you don't have any weird third party hardware connected and see if you're still having the issue. RAM is notoriously finicky, so I'd also look into that (although I admit I've never heard of janky RAM causing this sort of problem) - if the RAM has been upgraded at some point, try just running the original RAM that came with the machine when new. \nIf you can eliminate software being an issue, then at that point you'll know a hardware tech (Genius Bar or otherwise) would need to root out the hardware cause. \n", "Q: New Terminal behavior after upgrading to OS X 10.11 I've noticed square brackets in the \"gutters\" of a Terminal window when editing files in emacs. The brackets are on either side of the screen and go away if I force a window update by either resizing it or a ctrl-l. I'd like to figure out how to turn the feature off.\nHere I've just made some edits to the lines starting with 'a.x' and 'or'.\n\nHere's a zoomed out view showing the brackets in both the right and left hand sides of the screen.\n\nI have:\n\n\n*\n\n*looked at the preferences for Terminal \n\n*looked at my emacs configuration \n\n*built a new version of emacs ( 25.4 )\n\n*found an emacs feature new in 22.x called fringes\n\n\n*\n\n*set-fringe-mode off had no effect in 24.5 or 24.4\n\n\n*skipped local initialization (-q)\n\n*skipped all initialization (-Q)\n\n\nI fired up vi (vim 7.3) and lo and behold, the square brackets show up in the gutters there too!  So not an emacs problem more than likely.\nI'm running OS X 10.11 El Capitan on a mid 2014 MBP and the Terminal version number is 2.6 (361).  The change bars show up in text editors running within Terminal whenever a return occurs on a line with or without existing text and go away on a redraw.\nI'm hoping someone will see this and know how to turn it off.\n\nA: The short answer is \"Hide Marks\" in the \"View\" menu of Terminal.\nAfter I discovered the behavior wasn't specific to emacs, I started looking at Terminal more critically.\nIn the Edit->Marks menu there is an option 'Automatically Mark Prompt Lines' which defaults to on for El Capitan.  Disabling this option will stop the addition of new \"marks\".  You can remove specific marks using Cmd-Shift-U on the line you want to remove the mark from.  And finally \"Hide Marks\" to turn off the visual indicators of the marks.\nAfter removing emacs from the list of suspects, I found several other similar questions on Ask Different, Super User and Stack Overflow that all reached the same conclusion. \nCommenter nwinkler provided a link to his research on what marks are and how this feature can be used.

Since iOS 9, every time I get in my car and start it, I receive a notification that I can expect an x minutes drive to my home. How does the phone know that I'm driving my car?\nDoes it detect motion without footsteps? Does it know I just drove to that location and assumes that if I move away from it, I'm in my car again? Does it recognize that it has connected to my car's phone system via bluetooth?\nThe reason I'm suspecting the latter is that I got such a notification when my wife got into our car (which both of our phones are connected to) and drove away (while I walked away from that location).

When trying to connect to my iTunes library on my laptop, I get an error message (the iPhone cannot be used because it requires a newer version of iTunes). Both my phone and iTunes on my laptop state that I have the latest version... help!\n\nA: I just got the same error message.  Do you have a Windows system?  Is it Vista Home Premium?  I believe the problem is that iOS 9.0.2 needs iTunes 12.3, but Apple stopped supporting Vista with iTunes 12.3.  When I check for iTunes updates on my computer with Vista it tells me it's the current version.  It is 12.1, which IS the most current version for Windows Vista but the problem is iOS 9.0.2 needs iTunes 12.3.  They could have warned me before updating the iphone that it wouldn't work on the iTunes program that I was using to update the iphone.  Now what?  I have to upgrade Windows just to use itunes with my phone?\nUPDATE:  Bingo!  I went to Apple's website and found a page with \"older\" versions of iTunes.  It's crazy but there was a newer version of iTunes for Vista, even though the iTunes update check tells you 12.1 is the latest. More specifically, I had 12.1.2.7.  I downloaded 12.1.3.6 which still works with Vista and I can connect to my iphone again!  I hope it works for you too!  \nSo to recap, iTunes 12.1.3.6 will work with Vista AND iOS 9.0.2.  Here's the link for the download.

It tells SIP which files to protect. If you disable SIP, the restricted flag has no effect.\nDisabling SIP doesn't give you permission to the files though.

Prior to El Capitan, it was possible to force emptying of the Trash when stubborn or \"in use\" items prevented it with \"Secure Empty Trash\". This option has however been removed in El Capitan.\nHow do I force the Trash to empty on El Capitan?\n\nA: You can use 'rm' with the '-f' option:\nsudo rm -rf ~/.Trash /Volumes/*/.Trashes\n\nBe very careful if you manually type this in.\nThis empties the trash in your home folder and any trash on any other mounted partitions.\n\nA: If you open the trash and right click on the offending file there is a \"Delete Immediately…\" option. \nIt is not as simple as the old \"Secure Empty Trash\" in the Finder menu, but it gets the job done without using the terminal. \n\nA: Logging out of your user is a good first step to make sure it's not simply a user file still open.\nRestarting will clear the open file lock in almost all situations. If you still can't empty trash, you'll want to look at the files in the trash or repair the catalog/filesystem if that's the root cause of some file not closing when moved into the trash areas.\n\nA: I have the same frustrating problem and tried numerous methods that I could find from the web. However, nothing seemed to work until I did - \nsudo rm -rf ~/.Trash /Volumes/*/.Trashes \n\nIt really did the magic and the stubborn files (old time machine backups from an external hard disk) were finally deleted from Trash. It still took some time, but it did the magic at least.\nThanks for the answer.\n\nA: If you select an item or items and click on the “File” menu, there’s a “Move to Trash” choice; however, if you hold down the Option key with that “File” menu open, “Move to Trash” will switch to “Delete Immediately....”\nThis also works with files already in the Trash.\n\nA: I had the problem of a file that got in to the trash would not be emptied. Delete Immediately also didn't work on it. Restarting the Mac did not resolve the problem.\nI tried restarting in Safe Mode. The trash was empty.\nTurns out the files that wouldn't empty were on an external FAT32 drive with some corruption. This drive wouldn't appear on Safe Mode and so the trash appears empty.\nI don't have a PC to connect to and see if Windows can empty the trash. So I'll probably move the good contents from the FAT32 partition and format it.\n\nA: I experienced this frustrating problem. Persistent folders & files that would not empty from Trash. The folders/files were protected somehow and when I tried to change read/write permissions, I got a message saying I didn't have the \"necessary permission.\" I didn't want to do anything as radical as a fresh install.\nFinally I came across this guide to disabling SIP: http://osxdaily.com/2015/10/05/disable-rootless-system-integrity-protection-mac-os-x/\nI disabled SIP, emptied my Trash in the usual, normal way (it worked), and then re-enabled SIP.\nProblem solved.\n", "Q: Safari 9 Top Sites shortcut key gone missing or changed?

You can disable the guest account even though FileVault and Find My Mac are on. These are the steps that worked for me:\nStep 1. Turn off the Guest User (pay attention, buggy dialog!)\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to System Preferences - Users & Groups\n\n*Unlock all options using the lock on the bottom left\n\n*Click on the Guest User and make sure all options are off\n\n*If all options were off, enable Allow guests to log in to this computer\n\n*Then click on your primary username, then go back to the Guest User and turn off all options again. The Users & Groups dialog is really buggy. It might even automatically check Enable parental controls for no reason.\n\n*Before you close the dialog, make sure that all checkboxes are unchecked and that the description of the Guest User says Off.\n\n\nStep 2. Turn off all Sharing options/services (for now)\n\n\n*Go to System Preferences - Sharing\n\n*Uncheck all sharing options/services \n\n\nStep 3. Disable iCloud Find My Mac (for now)\n\n\n*Go to System Preferences - iCloud\n\n*Scroll down the list, and uncheck Find My Mac\nStep 4. Manually delete the Guest account\n\n\n*Open up a terminal, and execute the following command:\nsudo dscl . delete /Users/Guest\n\n*Check that there is no user Guest anymore with:\ndscl . list /Users\nStep 5. Reboot\n\n\n*Make sure that all dialogs are closed\n\n*Reboot\n\n\nIf you are lucky, your guest account is gone!\nIf not, retry step 4 (the dscl command) and reboot again.\nOnce your guest account is gone, you can re-enable iCloud Find My Mac and your sharing options/services. But stay away from the Users & Groups dialog.\n\nA: I had the same problem myself and I couldn't find any sources on how to do it. I just found out how to do it without disabling the Find my Mac option. Here's what you have to do. Make sure you disable the Find my mac option. Then click the Apple logo on the top left side then System Preferences > Security & Privacy > General > Advanced > Check \"Require an administrator password to access system-wide preferences  and after than shut down then open it again. you should see you own account only there without the Guest option. Go to the system preferences again to enable find my mac.\n\nA: @alan-shutko pointed out very important info about this in his comment:\n\nThe point is to make Find My Mac work. If you turn Find My Mac off,\n  the guest account will go away. The reason it's there if Find My Mac\n  is on is that if someone steals your mac, it cannot report its\n  position unless the thief connects it to a wifi network.\n\nLooks like we should keep it on.\n\nA: I struggled with this same problem in OS X El Capitan until I discovered a rather simple solution without disabling Find My Mac or FileVault:\n1) Click the Apple logo on the top left side then click,\nSystem Preferences > Users and Groups > Login Options >\n2) You'll find the selection Display login window as: , where the List of users is selected by default.\n3) Select Name and password.\n4) Restart. :)\nThe Guest account should no longer be there. If the is only one user account, you will just need to enter your password. Otherwise, with multiple user accounts you will also need to specify the Account Name.\nHope this helps. :D\n\nA: I kept seeing the Guest account listed on the login page. I remembered that I enabled FileVault before I had disabled the Guest account. So after I disabled the Guest account, I disabled and re-enabled FileVault. No more Guest on the login screen. But I can't completely disable the account.\n\nA: The only way I was able to get the issue fixed on my machine was to disable the guest account and also disabled Filevault. Reboot the machine and wait for the decryption to complete. Reboot again and the issue should be resolved.\n\nA: Its best to check and see if FileVault which is located in System Preferences under Security and Privacy is turned off.\nThat should make the Guest Account go away....\nThis is there so that you can have access to iCloud and you can reset your password if you forget it...\n\nA: I found a way. I tried so many things but I don't know why it fixed my problem. \nI disabled the guest account and I tried all above as well as other posts in the internet. all didn't work for me. My last try was that I created a new account in the MacBook Air. Now it shows my account and the new account only.

Everything was working fine until I upgraded to El Capitan a few days ago.\nNow Addressbook can't connect to the CardDAV-server anymore. After I checked the logfiles on my server, I figured out what the problem is: The setup assistant in System Preferences asks for the server address but actually saves a completely different (maybe standard) address, which then of course won't work.\nDoes someone know how to fix this? Maybe I can change the values via Terminal and change the settings there. \nIt also seems that these accounts don't sync properly via iCloud, which makes the account working fine on one machine and not working on the other machine. Of course I can't delete the synced account there and make a new one because then it will just move the problem between the machines. \n\nA: Something is clearly broken with El Capitan and CardDAV, but I could make it work by:\n\n\n*\n\n*properly set up the standard /.well-known/carddav and /.well-known/caldav redirects (see your CardDAV server documentation to see the destination URL)\n\n*use the Manuel settings type - there are now 3 types of CardDAV configurations in El Capitan: Automatic, Manual and Advanced.

If you need more information please tell me.\n\n\nA: You're not doing anything wrong, what's happening is your download is corrupted so when OS X does its integrity check, its' failing it. This is the message you are seeing.\nIt would be very helpful if you could post exactly which computer you are using, specifically the Model Identifier:, e.g MacBookPro10,1 and or MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Early 2013). If your computer can run the newest software (El Capitan), then you just need to open the mac app store, hit 'Get' and follow the steps on the screen.

The Internet is working fine, all other websites and download working fine, but the globe is stuck. \nPlease help, what should I do? I can't log in, I just see a blinking folder and Command R takes me directly to Internet recovery!\nModel is Macbook Pro Mid 2014\n\nA: Without a recovery partition and (for whatever reason) your Internet Recovery just won't work, you are down to about 3 options to get OS X installed:\nOption 1:  Install (or Recovery) at an Apple Store\nIf you are close to an Apple Store you can go into one and download the latest OS (if you have a working Mac) or run Internet Recovery using the Apple Network.\nNote: Internet Recovery will only install the last version you had, it won't upgrade.  For example, if you had Mavericks before and want to go to El Capitan, you will have to recover to Mavericks then download the El Capitan Installer.\nOption 2:  Download and Make a USB Installer\nThis involves using another Mac from a friend, family member or acquaintance.   You will need an 8GB flash drive.  There are many guides on how to create the USB installer so I won't belabor that point here, but the command you will need to execute in Terminal is as follows:\nsudo /Applications/Install\\ OS\\ X\\ El\\ Capitan.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/<USB Volume> --applicationpath /Applications/Install\\ OS\\ X\\ El\\ Capitan.app --nointeraction\n\nWhere <USB Volume> is the name of your USB Flash Drive (don't use spaces - it makes it easier)\nAfter about 10 minutes you will have a USB Flash drive to install OS X on your Mac.\nOption 3:  Acquire a premade USB Drive\nThis is not an official recommendation but sometimes when you are in a pinch and Options 1 and 2 are simply not feasible, it's nice to know that there's another option.  You can find these on eBay.  I have used this option  before when I had to restore a Macbook, Internet speed was slightly above dial up and the closest Apple store was in the next State.\nJust make sure you you deal with a reputable US based seller with good feedback.  If the seller is too new or feedback to low, look elsewhere even if the price is good.\n\nA: Are you behind a firewall, which stops any connections outgoing to / incoming from Apple Servers? Are you using the Mac at work?\nIf yes, that is likely the cause of your issue - Either the connection is very slow due to Authentication on the firewall, or Apple Servers are blocked by the Firewall. Try a different connection (different WiFi) or connection type (Wireless or Wired).\nHappened to me once, couldn't download updates for an iPhone, and a very slow Internet Recovery on a Mac due to a Firewall authenticating with Apple Servers. I connected with another internet connection without the mentioned authentication, and the Internet Recovery was faster.\n\nA: Same issue was true of me until I had changed my DNS addresses from router. Some countries are hindered to access Apple servers or vice-versa. However, it easily is fixed by changing DNS addresses, watch out, on router. When I was doing it, I used Google DNSes 8.8.4.4 / 8.8.8.8\n\nA: I would write OS X on a USB stick and boot from it.\nYou will need:\n\n\n*\n\n*A working PC, which I'm assuming runs some version of Windows.\n\n*A USB stick.\n\n\nFollow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*First, get a .dmg of the OS X's version you need.\n\n*Download the 15-days trial version of TransMac.\n\n*Backup any data from the USB stick. You are going to erase it entirely.\n\n*Launch TransMac, locate the stick, right-click on it and choose \"Restore with Disk Image\".\n\n*Locate the .dmg image you downloaded and select it as the source.\n\n*Once finished, push the stick in your Mac.\n\n*Power it and keep pressing the alt key until some icon pops up.\n\n*If you really erased the entire disk, there should be just one, and should be named something like \"OS X Install\".\n\n\nA: I had the same symptoms (globe and timer stuck, even overnight), but the issue was different. I just disconnected my external USB C display and Internet Recovery started in a couple of minutes.\n\nA: You simply need an external bootable .dmg file connected to the hardware via USB, SD card or external HDD. The OS on the bootable media can be macOS Sierra or any other version of macOS as long as it is supported by your system. The bootable media can be created using another Mac using the OS downloaded directly from the App Store.\n\nA: I had the same issue. I went and tried on a different on internet connection and it worked. So I guess you try a really really fast internet connection. It will work, don't give up.\n", "Q: How to trigger download of thumbnails of icloud photo library to iOS? After uploading a large number of photos through the web upload of iCloud Photos my iOS does not show thumbnails of those new pictures but a grid of icons with small clouds in it.\n\nIt has been like this since two days now. It seems the only way to get the thumbnails downloaded is to look at every picture on my iOS device.\nIs there more efficient way to download thumbnails? (Preferably in the background)\n\nA: The only way I have found is to click through each one. I usually start at the top and swipe through them, and they should start downloading.\n\nA: Reactivating iCloud Foto library and immediately restarting the phone did the trick for me. \nI deactivated iCloud Foto library and immediately activated it again. I then restarted the device (I killed the Foto app before deactivating and did not open it since then). After the restart, I opened the Foto app and charged my phone (make sure low power mode is off). I left it there for a couple of hours and suddenly, all thumbnails appeared. The same trick also works for keeping the originals if your phone won't download them until you open them. \n\nA: In addition to deactivating, rebooting, reactivating iCloud Photo Library from the iOS iCloud settings, i found that Photos app needs a little help triggering the download of the thumbnails by zooming into the level one out from fullscreen, then scroll through the empty squares. Scrolling can be done relatively quickly and for me makes the app start downloading those photos immediately after.\n", "Q: Does iPad mini 4 also feature the new and faster 2nd-Generation Touch ID sensor featured in the iPhone 6s? After I read on multiple websites that the new 2nd-Generation Touch ID sensor in the iPhone 6S is a lot faster, I was wondering if the new iPad mini 4 features the same sensor.\nBasically, I'm not interested if it is a new sensor (as I am not sure whether the improvement is due to new hard- or software), but rather if it reacts as fast in the iPad mini 4 as in the iPhone 6S.\n\nA: Apple's iPhone 6s website has a section about Touch ID on the Technology page. It says:\n\nTouch ID lets you unlock your phone and make purchases with Apple Pay simply by using your ﬁngerprint. It uses highly sophisticated algorithms to recognize and securely match your ﬁngerprint. And the improved Touch ID sensor detects your ﬁngerprint even faster than the previous generation.\n\nBy comparison, the iPad mini 4 has a whole page about Touch ID, but it never references a previous generation that's been improved upon. That leads me to think that the iPad mini 4 doesn't share the iPhone 6s's Touch ID 2 technology.\n\nA: I have both and can confirm that the iPad Mini 4 does not have the iPhone 6S TouchID Sensor. Side by side the iPad feels more like the iPhone 6 where you have to pause on the button to authenticate. Quite disappointing.\n", "Q: Cannot install Xcode 7 I recently upgraded to El Capitan and it broke my Macports as well as some of the compilers I use, so I'm trying to upgrade Xcode from 6 to 7. \nFirst, I tried the ordinary way; i.e. click the \"upgrade\" button in the App Store. However, clicking it greyed it out for about 10 sec, and then it ungreyed as if nothing happened. It didn't show the usual \"installing, 45 min remaining\" progress bar that the App Store usually showed. \nThen I went into /Applications folder and manually deleted the Xcode app and then emptied the trash. In Finder, I had the \"details\" view set up, so I could see date modified, size etc. For the size field for the Xcode icon/entry, it actually had a progress bar that was about 5% filled for some reason. I wasn't sure what this meant, but I deleted Xcode anyone. I only realized after deleting Xcode that this icon was not my previous Xcode version 6, but it was the App Store actually trying to install Xcode 7. I was confused because, as I noted above, when I clicked the update button in App Store, it didn't show the progress bar, it just momentarily greyed and ungreyed.\nHowever, I then restarted my computer, and now when I go to App Store, the Xcode update doesn't appear in my Updates \"panel\" at all. I searched for Xcode in the App Store, and there's a button that says \"install\". I click it and nothing happens. I also tried searching for Xcode on google, and the page simply tells me to go to App Store. I guess my other options are to install the Xcode 7.1 beta, or re-install a previous version, say Xcode 6 from an installation file, but I would prefer to install the current stable version (although from App Store reviews it seems like the current Xcode is none too popular).\nAnyone know how I can do this now? It seems like the app store process for installing Xcode 7 is majorly majorly screwed up, at least for my particular machine.  \n\nA: Okay, solved: I just clicked the \"Purchased\" tab in my App Store, and it looks like it was installing the entire time. \nThis was extremely confusing, because for some reason there was absolutely no indication in the Updates tab that Xcode was installing or downloading (as there usually is for updates), so I didn't even realize that it was installing. There was also no indication in the \"App Search\" Panel where I got the page for Xcode with the install button on it, i.e. when I clicked the button, the only thing that happened was the button changed to \"installing\", and there was no progress bars or statuses anywhere in sight, so I wasn't sure if it was actually installing or just hanging.\nI just realized, since I DELETED the entire Xcode the very first time, when I'm installing Xcode it doesn't count as an Update, so that's why it does not appear in the Updates tab. I guess when I searched for Xcode in the App store, and clicked Install, it was installing in the Purchased tab.\n", "Q: Applescript to check for the existence of a file I record radio programs during the night and then run an applescript to rename the files.

Like in the title, I've used ShadowKiller (very old but worked until 10.11) but it doesn't work in 10.11 and 10.12 as well (tried disabling SIP).\nI've tried using the command line trick, toggle-osx-shadows from github and couple of others, it seems that something changed in 10.11\nDoes anybody have a solution?\n\nA: edit 01-11-2019: Works on Mojave.\nThere is a solution - plugin called winBuddy which is available through MacForge (previously known as mySIMBL).\nIt allows you to turn off window shadow and/or window borders for every app.\nI've just tested it and it seems to work properly, there are some minor glitches here and there but nothing major.\nMinor glitches include:\n\n\n*\n\n*You can't change window options for apps which don't have menu - like Bartender for example\n\n*You can't change window options for some apps, as winBuddy does not show up under 'Window' in menu.\n\n", "Q: Concerned I may have accidentally dropped malware (or something) onto my system First time poster in this part of Stack Exchange - apologies I have posted in the wrong section.\nIn short I have an iMac running 10.8. Most of the time I quite happily get about my business but about every 3-4 years I do something stupid. Today was one of those days.\nBasically I was looking at an alternative method of running Mame (currently use the OpenEmu route). Basically downloaded SDLMame, then was going to go the QMC2 front end route for a GUI. Downloaded both, but when downloading QMC2 (from what is a legitimate site) - installed the package and it installed a folder into my Applications folder with no permission to access it. In short, I didn't like that at all (as that is a fairly non-standard thing), deleted the folder (securely) without installing the application file, and then ran Intego Virus Scanner with week old definitions, and ClamXAV. Neither picked anything up when downloading the packages (I always check all downloads that way) and neither picked anything odd up on my system afterwards (after deleting). In short my iMac hasn't behaved erratically since but I just wish to be 100% so is there anything else further than I can do? I have also run Etre Check, and it didn't pull anything obviously abnormal except for the fact that I need to update my Flash as there has been a new recommended version released etc.\nI expect I may be having an over-reaction and it is possibly standard for that emulator (had never used it before) but I take the better to be safe than sorry approach.\nThanks in advance for any suggestions.\n\nA: It looks like you did your due diligence and there is no evidence of a real malware problem - it sounds like their installer just screwed up the permissions.\nFire up Terminal, and do an ls -l of your Applications folder, looking for the QMC2 folder. I'd be willing to be it did something like installing as root (I bet the package asked for your password, right?) and missed correcting the permissions.\nOnce you've found it, you can do a chown (your username) -R (QMC2 path) to set everything to your user.\n", "Q: Force Contacts update in iOS9 Sometimes I update a contact on Mac and I need it immediately on my iPhone. Until iOS 8.x, to force contacts to update, was necessary to go in contacts, go back to groups then scroll tu update...easy!\nNow, iOS9, scroll to update in groups disappeared and I can't find an alternative way to force contacts update!\nThe easiest way I find to do that is to create an imaginary contact then remove it and this way works but it doesn't sound a lot as official!\nHas someone has find alternative methods?\n\nA: In Settings, visit \"Mail, Contacts Calendars.\" Scroll down and select \"Fetch New Data.\" Then, on that screen, temporarily turn on \"Push,\" and then make sure iCloud is also set to push, so that new data is pushed from the server automatically whenever possible. This should push through any new data immediately. \nYou may then want to switch Push off for data, and choose one of the Fetch settings to save battery. \n\nA: If you sync you contacts with your google account, then simply check your email.\nIOS syncs mail and contacts at the same time.\n", "Q: Cannot mount bootable Windows 10 drive I am trying to make a bootable USB with the dd command since Boot Camp does not work. If I execute this command:\nsudo dd if=Win10.iso of=/dev/disk1 bs=1m\n\nI get a disk formatted as Universal Disk Format with a GUID partition scheme making it unbootable. The way I changed it to Master Boot Record (FDisk) partition scheme was to erase the failed USB contents, change it to FDisk, and run the dd command with disk1s1 instead of disk1 (disk1s1 was the identifier of the only partition on the USB).\nWhat that has done was made an unmounted partition called disk1s1, formatted in FAT and with the FDisk partition scheme, but it is unmountable and I cannot boot from it. When I try mounting it, nothing happens, and the terminal command output is Volume on disk1s1 failed to mount. I cannot repair disk and Verify disk says Invalid BS_jmpBoot in boot block: 000000\nAs far as I can remember, Ubuntu's bootable USB showed similar behavior with the unmountable disk, but it was detectable by rEFInd.\nUPDATE:\nThe error message I get in VirtualBox is:\nVD: error VERR_NOT_SUPPORTED opening image file '/Users/username/RawWinDisk.vmdk' (VERR_NOT_SUPPORTED).\nVD: error VERR_NOT_SUPPORTED opening image file '/Users/username/RawWinDisk.vmdk' (VERR_NOT_SUPPORTED).\nFailed to open image '/Users/username/RawWinDisk.vmdk' in read-write mode (VERR_NOT_SUPPORTED).\nFailed to attach driver below us!

I have tried to update everything for the latest version of VirtualBox, but I may have messed up somewhere...\nThe method I use relies on VirtualBox for its operation. Follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install the latest version of VirtualBox from https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads. Make sure it installs the command line tools.\n\n*Once installed, open it and create a new VM by clicking \"New\" on the top left.\n\n*Select the type to be \"Microsoft Windows\", and select the version as \"Windows 10 (64 bit)\", then give it a name of your choosing.\n\n*Select \"Do not add a virtual hard drive\". We will be creating one on our own for our purposes. Click \"Create\".\n\n*If you have not created a partition for Windows, do so now in Disk Utility. Click on the disk (not any partition) in the sidebar, and click the partitions tab. Then click the \"+\" button, and make a new partition as large as you want it to be. 30GB is a good minimum size.\n\n*Now we have to open the Terminal. Type the following command: diskutil list. From the list of disks, make a note of the disk identifier in the last column that belongs to the partition you created for Windows. We will need this in the next step.\n\n*Run the command sudo chown $USER /dev/disk#s#. Replace disk#s# with the identifier from earlier. Enter your password and push return. Also run sudo chown $USER /dev/disk#s1. Use the same identifier, but replace the last number with a 1. Also run sudo chown $USER /dev/disk# using the first half of your identifier (minus the s# part).\n\n*Unmount the disk by typing diskutil unmount /dev/disk#s# using your identifier.\n\n*Now we have to create the disk for the VM to use for installation. Run the command VBoxManage internalcommands createrawvmdk -filename ~/RawWinDisk.vmdk -rawdisk /dev/disk# -partitions 1,#. Replace \"disk#\" with the appropriate first half of the identifier from earlier, and replace the second # sign with the last number in your identifier.\n\n*Unmount the disk again diskutil unmount /dev/disk#s#, using your identifier.\n\n*Now you should have a \".vmdk\" file in your home folder. Go back into VirtualBox, select the VM you created, and click \"Settings\". Select the \"Storage\" tab, add an IDE controller by clicking the second \"+\" icon at the bottom, click on the \"IDE\" controller and click the second \"+\" sign directly to right of the controller (the hover text is \"Add Hard Disk\").\n\n*Click \"Choose existing disk\", and navigate to the VMDK we just created, which should be in your home folder. Click it and select \"Open\". Now you should see the newly added disk just below the \"IDE\" controller.\n\n*Click on \"Empty\" just below the \"SATA\" controller, check \"Live CD/DVD\", and click the little CD icon next to \"SATA Port #\".\n\n*Click \"Choose Virtual Optical Disk File...\", navigate to your ISO, and open it.\n\n*Start the VM and install windows on the 30G partition.\n\n*When the installation is done and you're logged in, shut down Windows and you should see the disk created by Windows appear on the desktop. You can get the Boot Camp drivers for your laptop from https://support.apple.com/kb/DL1720?locale=en_US. Put this on a flash drive formatted as ExFAT or FAT so Windows can read it.\n\n*You should now be able to reboot into Windows by holding alt down, or selecting the disk in Startup Disk preferences.\n\n\nMake sure you update your BootCamp with Apple Software Update once you have BootCamp installed on the Windows side. These are technically Windows 8.1 drivers, which should work well enough for you to at least connect to the internet and get the latest version.\n", "Q: Is reinstalling Mavericks possible via recovery mode with two HDs and without a backup? I can't get my iMac working and I don't have a backup.\nIf I choose to reinstall Mavericks or Lion (it shipped with Lion, I upgraded to Mavericks) will that wipe over the core HD?\nI got core HD 350 GB and another internal HD of 2 TB.\nIf I choose the install destination to be the 350 core HD, will that wipe out data on it?\n\nA: If you reinstall OS X from Recovery HD or the installer app (or Internet Recovery), your Mac's HD will not get erased.  If the installer needs to erase things, it will tell you, so go slowly and really read the words if you get a dialog box and choices. \nIf you are concerned, install OS X onto any free USB drive and then get a good backup of the system you care not to loose. \n", "Q: How to I make my text messages go as iMessages When I send a text to my brother's iPhone from my iPhone it goes as a text.

His number is listed as an iPhone in my contacts.\n\nA: I've had this happen before, and it took erasing the phone number and re-adding it to the contact for the iMessage system to correctly \"sync up\".\nAnother thing you can try doing is deleting the phone number, and then adding his Apple registered email address first (add the email, save the contact, then add the phone number).\n", "Q: My new Sennheiser G4ME ZERO headset won't send audio to my Mac I recently purchases a Sennheiser G4ME Zero to replace my Steel Series Siberia V3. The Siberia's microphone worked just fine along with the audio. When I plugged my G4ME Zero in the audio output worked great. When I tested out the microphone, my Macbook didn't receive any input. I plugged in my old Siberia to see if it was a hardware problem with the Mac but it showed up as a working external mic.\nI've tried switching out cords, blowing out the input, and just plugging in the microphone portion to the computer but it still won't work. Is it a hardware problem with the headset or what?\n\nA: If you are using a MacBook with a single 3.5mm jack, you need to make sure you are using the TRRS cable from Sennheiser. That's the one that will have 3 narrow bands on the shaft of the jack (separating the four metallic connections stereo/left, stereo/right, microphone, and ground). Is that how your Siberia works?

It allows to use GPU instead CPU when it is possible. \nHere is the link which helps me to solve my problem :\nhttps://support.mozilla.org/fr/questions/1049291\n", "Q: iOS 9.0.2 made my iPhone 5 stuck on \"connect to itunes\" screen I decided to download iOS 9.0.2 for my iPhone 5.\nWhen the download finished it was stuck on a screen I have never seen before.\nHere's a picture:\n\nWhen I plug it into my pc, iTunes doesn't find my phone for some reason.\n\nA: That image means that your phone is in recovery mode, basically it's asking you to hook it up to itunes so it can be reflashed.\nThat isn't something that normally comes up as part of an iOS upgrade, so i'm lead to believe that the upgrade was probably not successful.\nTry rebooting the phone first. Hold down the volume down and home buttons until the screen blanks out. Does it come back or show the same message?\nIf it didn't work, and you're back to the same screen, you said that the phone wasn't recognized - try rebooting your machine first, then fire up iTunes. It should pop up a box saying that it's detected a phone in recovery mode: \nIf that doesn't work, the next thing to do is to put the phone in DFU (device firmware upgrade) mode. It presents to the computer as a different \"kind\" of device and may work around whatever's preventing the phone from appearing correctly to itunes.\nIf even that didn't work - something else has gone quite wrong, and you should contact Apple support.\n", "Q: El Capitan gives me a kernel panic error right after installing Almost immediately after the installation reboot, and seconds after the apple logo appears the following error shows up;\npanic(cpu 0 caller 0xffffff8017d263a6) : \"zone_init;kmem_suballoc failed\"@/Library/Caches/com.apple.xbs/Sources/xnu/xnu-3247.1.106/osfmkkern/zall oc.c:2199\n\nThis is a 2010 iMac running the latest Yosemite with all updates installed. \nAny guesses for the cause?\nModel Name: iMac\nModel Identifier: iMac11,3\nProcessor Name: Intel Core i5\nProcessor Speed: 2.8 GHz\nNumber of Processors: 1\nTotal Number of Cores: 4\nL2 Cache (per Core): 256 KB\nL3 Cache: 8 MB\nMemory: 12 GB\nProcessor Interconnect Speed: 4.8 GT/s\n\nA: This is really basic memory allocation that's failing (zalloc.c) - and even if your install was completely trashed by outside forces, I'd expect a panic just about anywhere else in the system. This is a pretty low level failure.\nIf you can't get a recovery install to work, your next step is to call support, because this looks very much like a hardware problem.\n\nA: It's possible that you have a corrupted installer. I would suggest downloading it again and following instructions to make a bootable drive using the create install media tool provided in terminal. \nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201372\nI would not agree that there was a hardware problem due to the fact that you were able to use the computer after reinstalling 10.10 there is also a 3rd party app called disk maker X if you would prefer to not use Terminal \nhttp://diskmakerx.com\nI have had this happen to me before,when an installer was bad. It didn't load the OS correctly and it was just the installer.\n", "Q: Updating MacBook Pro to OSX EL Capitain I'm creating my first iOS game and I use Xcode 6.1 now. I want to update to OSX EL Captain because it has Quicktime where I can make a video of me playing from the Device instead of simulator.\nWould updating to EL Capitain, force Xcode to make me upgrade to Xcode 7?\n\nA: No. In fact, Xcode requires a (rather large and separate) download from the App Store. You're safe in upgrading.\nNote that some command line utilities (development stuff) or package managers like Homebrew or MacPorts may behave strangely if you run an old Xcode on a new OS.\n", "Q: How to turn off Auto-show sidebar in fullscreen Safari 9 In the new El Capitan version of OS X, in safari 9, in fullscreen if you move your cursor to the left, it shows the sidebar.\nIs there a way to disable it ?\n\nA: Simply copy and paste one or both into Terminal:\ndefaults write com.apple.safari ShowSidebarInTopSites bool=FALSE\ndefaults write com.apple.safari ShowSidebarInNewWindows bool=FALSE\n\nIf you don't want to copy two commands, then you can do both at the same time:\ndefaults write com.apple.safari ShowSidebarInTopSites bool=FALSE; defaults write com.apple.safari ShowSidebarInNewWindows bool=FALSE\n\n\nA: I have found an \"solution\" Just put your dock on the left side and the problem was resolved.\nBut PLEASE send your feedback here : http://www.apple.com/feedback/safari.html\n\nA: Just keep using Safari in fullscreen with the dock set to the left side in System Preferences. Enter this command in Terminal without quotes: \"defaults write com.apple.Dock autohide-delay -float 1000 && killall Dock\"\nThis will fix the issue.\nNote: the dock will need the \"Mission Control four finger swipe up\" to show/hide it.\nTo make things back the way they were, enter this in Terminal: \"defaults delete com.apple.Dock autohide-delay && killall Dock\"\n", "Q: How do I change geolocation of photos in the Photo app? The thing is, there is a bunch of photos I've taken that are referred at the wrong location.\nFor example: there is a picture of my dad that was taken at my home in Barueri, Brazil and the Photo app says that it was taken at Ar Riyad, Saudi Arabia\nLots of other photos are located in places like Africa and Western Asia, places that I've never been before.\nIs there a way to correct it?\n\nA: I do not know a way to edit the location of photos on the iPhone but with El Capitan you can now edit them in the Desktop Photo App:\n\n\n*\n\n*select the one or more photos\n\n*press cmdI or use Window -> Info\n\n*check/enter and/or edit the location information under Location\n\n\nA: That information is based on the GPS information in the EXIF metadata, and cannot be changed in the Photos app.\nIf you export the photo to your Desktop, then open it in Preview, you should be able to cmdI and select the 'More Info' tab (the 'i' with a circle around it) and check the 'GPS' tab to see if the information is correct. If you want to change the GPS coordinates, there are a number of third-party tools to do this – but I generally use ExifTool.\n\nA: You can use Third party apps like EXIF Viewer by Fluntro to bulk edit location of multiple photos together.\nAnalysing,\nBarueri, Brazil coordinates - 23.5113° S, 46.8729° W\nAr Riyad, Saudi Arabia coordinates - 24.7136° N, 46.6753° E\nRoot cause of the problem might be,\nThe Camera app which writes GPS data might have incorrectly stored \"N\" instead of \"S\" and \"E\" instead of \"W\". This doesn't happen with iOS's default camera app. So you might be using third party Camera app i guess.\nDisclaimer: I have developed the EXIF Viewer by Fluntro App :) \nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/app/exif-viewer-by-fluntro/id944118456?mt=8\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycz0b0uDn9A\n\n\n\nA: Not sure if you already solved\nKoredoko is what you are searching for\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/app/koredoko-exif-and-gps-viewer/id286765236?mt=8\n", "Q: iMessage conversations on iPad 2 are not appearing on my iPhone 5 I've just bought myself an iPhone 5, I've set up iCloud on it and synced it with my iPad. However, all of the iMessage conversations I had on my iPad are not showing up on my iPhone's iMessages. How can I load and continue to have my old iMessage conversations from my iPad to my iphone?\n\nA: They are not stored in iCloud (or the iMessage server). This is for your own privacy. \nThey cannot be redownloaded.\n", "Q: Can still boot to Windows even though I deleted the partition I re-installed Mac OS and erased the recovery partition so Bootcamp would have a punt at installing Windows.\nStill not managed to re-install Windows, and when I boot with -Alt- held down it still shows Windows as a disk. Why is it still there?\n\nA: First of all the Recovery partition has nothing to do with BootCamp. BootCamp installs a small Windows boot partition that then points to the (separate) Windows partition where the rest of the installation is, if I recall correctly.\nWhen you hold down the Option key at boot (it's only called \"ALT\" on Windows) the Mac only sees the small boot partition not the second one with the Windows installation on it.\nI would be willing to bet that if you selected to boot from Windows from the boot menu you would get an error about *no bootable disk found\" or some such.\nIn the case of BootCamp it is best to not do anything outside the BootCamp installer environment unless you have a bit of experience with it and know just how the partition map is set up. Apple likes to insulate users from the innards of the OS so you rarely see the whole story.\nJust like you won't know how to remodel an 1890s Victorian by watching This Old House, watching what the BootCamp application seems to do won't tell you the whole story.\n", "Q: Where is the swipe-right iOS 9 Spotlight screen on my iPod Touch? I have an iPod Touch (5th generation) with iOS 9 installed (currently 9.0.2, but I don't think the minor revision matters). From the home screen, I can reach the quick Spotlight search by swiping down. However, the new Spotlight screen reached by swiping right does not appear to be available. \nI have checked an iPhone 6 with iOS 9 and of course the screen appears. For clarity, the screen I'm talking about is this one:\n\nIs this screen not available on the iPod Touch for some reason? Or is this a consequence of my device only having a 32-bit CPU? (I know that some features such as the new ad blockers are not available for 32-bit devices.) Does this screen appear on an iPod Touch 6th generation (which has a 64-bit CPU)?\n\nA: That screen is not supported on any iDevice powered by the A5 SoC (so it's not on the iPad 2, iPhone 4S, or iPod Touch (5th-Generation)). Apple's older product support is great, I'd like to see someone even using an Android phone from 2011, let alone see that phone running the latest version of Android. Given that, this is likely not an example of planned obsolescence, but a result of the fact that the newer hardware found in the 6th-Gen iPod Touch is much more powerful than that found in the 5th-Gen, not just graphics processing, but more RAM (1 GB vs 512 MB), a faster CPU, and better power efficiency.\n", "Q: Hook into Spotlight I'm trying to figure out if its possible to include custom results in the Spotlight search. Our organization has an external page for looking up certain data and I want to be able to include these results in the spotlight search results. Is this possible? Otherwise, is this something that a 3rd party tool could be configured for?\n\nA: On iOS 9 this year, Apple completely revamped Spotlight Search and now there are way better APIs available to developers.\nIf you want this to appear to public users, you can look at the new Web Markup.\nIf you only want people in your organization to be able to see these results this is what I would do. If you have an app that people at your organization use I would simply add some code to periodically check for results and use the CoreSpotlight API to add them into Spotlight. You could handle the website in your app, or make it take them to Safari when the result is tapped. If you do not have an app you would have to create one and give it to your users (slightly less convienient).\n", "Q: How can I restore from today's iPhone iOS 9 backup when iTunes not giving me the option? Had to do a reset to factory settings of my iPhone today. I backed it up before doing this. I now want to restore to the backup done earlier today...but when I click on \"restore backup\" today's backup isn't one of the options. The latest one I'm given the option on is Sept 15, 2015. Help!\nHow can I restore the earlier backup from today when iTunes isn't giving me that option? Thanks.\n\nA: I am assuming you have looked through the drop down menu for backups and didn't see your most current one. Have you tried restarting iTunes/MAC or PC? If restarting didn't help...\nIn that case I would look at the iTunes backup folder to see if the latest one was even created. Go to the iTunes mobile back up folder. Here is how to find that folder:\nUnder Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8 or Windows 10, stored in\n\\Users(username)\\AppData\\Roaming\\Apple Computer\\MobileSync\\Backup\nUnder Mac OS X, stored in\n\\Users(username)/Library/Application Support/MobileSync/Backup/.\nYou should see bunch of files that have random character file names. Sort them by date and see if the one you just created is there. If not, then your only option is to use the Sept. 15 backup.\nIf it is there... Back up all your backups to another location! (keep in mind that backups can be large and you may need extra storage space and it may take a long time to copy all the backups). There are software out there available that will make backups for you if you aren't comfortable doing this yourself. You can also take your computer and iPhone to the Apple store and they should help you with this.\nWhat I have done in the past is copy all the backups to another folder (with iTunes closed). Then I deleted all backups in the backup folder leaving only the one I want iTunes to use. Please be careful with this step as you may risk loosing all your backups. Then restart your iTunes and the right backup should be there. If it isn't there, then the backup maybe corrupted and in that case I wouldn't even try to use it.\nDon't forget to put all the other backups back into the backup folder in case you want to use them at another time.\n\nA: The issue, it turns out, was that I had backed up my iphone yesterday with an iOS 9.1 beta backup. I then installed iOS 9.02 - the latest public version of iOS. When I tried to restore the backup I was unable to because the operating system I was running was older than the one of the backup. A boneheaded mistake that has now been fixed.\n", "Q: How to run VLC on El Capitan? El Capitan claims \"VLC.app will damage your computer.\" When trying to run VLC, El Capitan reports this message:\n“VLC.app” will damage your computer. You should move it to the Trash.\n\nI tried downloading a fresh copy of VLC, but this didn't fix the issue.\nHow can I run VLC on El Capitan?\nP.s. I tried the \"control-open\" but unlike Mavericks, that didn't allow the application to start.\n\nA: I've had the same issue with El Capitan. Strangely, i could open the VLC.app from within the mounted dmg (OS X just said its unsigned) but not after I copied it to /Applications.\nSo I tried to copy it with the terminal like\ncp -R /Volumes/vlc-2.2.1/VLC.app /Applications/\n\nand voila, after that I could also open it from within the Applications folder.\nPlease note the \"-R\"-option.\nI think this is safer than allowing malicious files to be executed by disabling Gatekeeper.\n\nA: Option 1:\nGo to \"System Preferences\" -> \"Security & Privacy\" -> \"General\"\nFor \"Allow apps downloaded from:\" choose \"Mac App Store and identified developers\"\nThen you should be able to right-click open the application and confirm security exception.\nOption 2:\nWhen opening the application a security warning came up saying application wasn't signed.\nI went to security settings and it had selected VLC ready for me to approve security exception for VLC, which I did.\nVLC now works with El Captain.\nP.s. I tried the \"control-open\" but unlike Mavericks, that didn't allow the application to start.\n\nA: Also make sure you are downloading the legitimate version of vlc\nThere is some nasty malware going around, actually the first link on google when you search VLC is false, make sure you are downloading from the actual VideoLan website and not filling your computer with nasty viruses (yes even mac users).\n\nA: chown -R root:admin /Applications/VLC.app\n\nGatekeeper will not get in the way.\n\nA: In system preference, under security and confidentiality, check the box saying something like \"allow downloaded apps from anywhere\". If the box is greyed out, click on the lock at the bottom left corner and enter your password.\n\nA: Download VLC from Safari (not Chrome)\n\nA: In my case, after upgrading to El Capitan, VLC crashed unconditionally a couple of seconds after opening any media. It was not a security issue because I have Allow apps downloaded from: anywhere in system settings. Happened both with the latest official version downloaded manually from the videolan.org or via homebrew.\nThe fix was building manually from git according to the instructions at https://wiki.videolan.org/OSXCompile (section Build VLC with a single command):\ngit clone git://git.videolan.org/vlc.git\ncd vlc && mkdir build && cd build\n../extras/package/macosx/build.sh\n\nNOTE: You'll need Xcode and xcode command line tools .\nThe git version plays some media files but crashes with video streams which worked fine before the El Capitan upgrade. Hopefully they will fix this soon.\n\nA: For future reference, you can open unsigned apps without a trip to settings if you know what you're doing: Right click on the application, and select 'open'. It will still give you a scary dialog, but with an option to open the app.\nI haven't had a chance to test this on El Cap, so I'd be interested to hear if this still works.\n", "Q: How can I make my headphone jack work on my Macbook Pro 15\" Retina Display, it quit working randomly So I have been using different headphones here and there, but also running a synthesizer program out of my headphone jack into the mixer for live audio performance. \nEverything always works fine, except for yesterday, it started that no headphones/speakers will work anymore for anything coming out of the 1/8\" headphone jack.  Yes, I have them plugged in all the way, yes i have tried different headphones/speakers etc...  Yes I have gone into settings/audio and selected the proper output and made sure that nothing is muted, all sound is balanced and that it is turned up.  The headphones just put out the most faint level of audio that isn't easily detected unless you really press the headphones onto your ears.  All this while the regular Macbook speakers work if you unplug the headphones.  \nI need my headphones to plug in so I can mix audio that has to be done this week, yet I can't get any sound through them.  I have tried all things online to reset certain functions of the computer, and the closest Apple store is over 2.5 hours away.  What makes this situation worse is that I have Apple support by phone but I am unable to speak due to strained vocal cords, so I am kind of in Limbo, is there anywhere to chat online? \n\nA: Your speakers not working after you unplug your headphone jack is a dead giveaway that your headphone jack is full of dust or some other kind of foreign substance. Get a can of compressed air (you must be 18 to purchase compressed air, also it costs about $5 per can) from Wal-Mart or Best Buy or another retailer and use it to blow the headphone jack clean and you should find that it works again.\n", "Q: Malware attack freezes Safari—prevention or detection? Several times in the past few months, a web link has popped up a box alleging that malware has been detected and I should click OK to let them fix it.  I'm not stupid enough to even click anywhere near it, but whoever created this thing has figured out how to lock Safari completely.  Can't use back button or change tabs or access any menus.  Force-Quit is the only option.\nI can't remember the exact wording, but something about it convinced me that the malware knows I am on a Mac.  In other words, it is more sophisticated than the Windows attacks that I occasionally see.\nSometimes, but not always (Why/How?), re-launching Safari re-launches all the tabs, including the offensive one.  (Even though I said not to in preferences.)\nIs there a way after the fact to get the IP address the thing comes from?  Or to determine how the freeze is caused and prevent it?\nThis has happened on three different versions of Safari.  It's not the same as the pop-up with the toll-free phone number which doesn't freeze Safari.\n\nA: I have run into similar situations. I gather the host DNS name from the url and put a matching line into my /etc/hosts file. The I force quit safari and relaunch.\nThe line I add to /etc/hosts looks like this:\n127.0.0.5        badhost.com\n\nThis will redirect all browser requests to the badhost to localhost (the local machine) where the requests timeout. This breaks the javascript that is holding your browser hostage. I'm using 127.0.0.5 (instead of 127.0.0.1) so I can distinguish the bad requests from normal localhost requests with my networking tools. \n", "Q: Update my IPod help I have iOS 6.1.6 on my iPod touch gen 4 and I want to upgrade it to iOS 8 at the least, can anyone help me? I've checked it but it says it's up to date.\n\nA: Your 4th generation iPod Touch can't be updated past iOS 6.1.6. See the list of supported devices for iOS 7:\n\niPod Touch\n\n*\n\n*iPod Touch (5th generation)\n\n\niOS 8 and 9 are the same story - your iPod Touch likely won't get any more software updates.\n", "Q: El Capitan Download would not resume I started downloading El Capitan and left my computer for a while, but it had gone into the sleep mode and the download was paused. But when I tried to resume it would not start even after restarting my computer.\n\nA: I ran into the same situation as well. Just open mission control (4 fingers gesture), click and hold on the El Capitan icon and click remove (or delete). Then reinstall it on the mac app store. It worked for me. Hope it help. \n\nA: I have tried to resume the download through the purchased tab, but still had the same problem (waiting...). But when I tried to download yosemite again the download of EL Capitan has resumed.\n", "Q: Unable to modify administrative settings after El Capitan upgrade After upgrading to El Capitan from Yosemite, my main administration account was removed. After recovering it by forcing the first time setup to run again, I am now unable to change system settings. For example, if I open up \"Users and Groups\" and click the lock to make changes, it prompts for my password. I enter my password (that has admin privileges) and it accepts it, but the lock status doesn't change. I've also upgraded XCode to v7, and it prompts for my password to accept the license agreement. If I enter it incorrectly, I get the shaky box, but if I enter it correctly, it accepts it, but the license agreement box doesn't go away.\nI've attempted to resolve this by turning off SIP and by using the \"resetpassword\" utility on both the Root Admin and my user's account and neither option has worked.\nI'm out of ideas here- hoping one of you can help. Thanks in advance.\nEdit\nSo I ran dscacheutil and shows two entries for root user. Does that mean anything?\n\n\nA: If you are using Centrify, then this thread led me to this Apple forums answer: let the system rebuild the authentication database:\nsudo mv /var/db/auth.db /var/db/auth.db.old\n\nand restart. This fixed all the related privilege escalation failures for me and I seem to recall a Centrify upgrade was supposed to be done before the Mavericks upgrade too.\nIt has not, however, re-enabled network user logon. The check-box to allow network user logon is missing from Users & Groups still.\n", "Q: Does Time Machine save TextEdit drafts? Imagine you have Time Machine running with Yosemite.\nYou open TextEdit, create a new text document in which you actually write stuff.\nYou can turn off your computer, restart it, the document will still be there.\nBut you never saved it once, never. It's just a draft that gets saved as a draft (where?) - when you log out.\nThen if you close the window, and lose this document, I assume there's a copy of it somewhere since every time you turned your computer off and on again, the document was there!\nBut... where would you now look for it in Time Machine?\n\nA: Time Machine does back them up.\nThey are kept in\n~/Library/Containers/com.apple.TextEdit/Data/Library/Autosave Information/\nFile named Unsaved TextEdit Document\nso, for Time Machine, it would be\n/Volumes/[TMvolume]/Backups.backupdb/[computer]/Latest/[drive name]/Users/[user]/Library/Autosave Information\nor use the first path & Enter Time Machine, which would probably be simpler.\n", "Q: What happens if I edit a duplicate Hosts file? What exactly is a duplicate file?\nWhen I wanted to edit the hosts file (/private/etc/hosts), it says:\n\nYou don't own the file \"hosts\" and don’t have permission to write to\n  it.\nYou can duplicate this document and edit the duplicate. Only the duplicate will include your changes.\n\nSo, if I do my edits in the duplicate hosts file, is it equivalent to having my hosts file edited?\n\nA: This is a poorly chosen vocabulary since in a MacOS X file system a duplicate is a serious error meaning that the file-system is deeply corrupted.\nThe correct term which should have been used here is the term of copy.\nIf you don't have permission to edit /private/etc/hosts then make a local copy as follows:\ncp /private/etc/hosts ~/hosts\n\nIf you really need to edit the /private/etc/hosts, I advise you to make first a backup local copy as above. And once you have edited and thoroughly verified it,\nput it back into place with sudo to get the admin priviledges:\n/usr/bin/sudo cp ~/hosts /private/etc/hosts\n\n\nA: The Hosts file is not owned by any user, it is owned by System (root). The standard way to edit it is to drag a copy to the desktop, edit that, then drag it back & authenticate. Then you need to change the owner back to root.\nTo avoid all this fiddling around, you could use GasMask (freeware), which allows you to edit, copy [duplicate] & keep multiple hosts files, instantly switchable.\n", "Q: Automatically hide sidebar in preview I recently upgraded to El Capitan.\nWhenever I open an pdf file of more than 1 pages, Preview opens the sidebar. Is there a way to permanently disable it?\n\nA: Sorry, but the plain terminal command defaults write com.apple.Preview PVPDFSuppressSidebarOnOpening true did not work for me.  After, Preview.app opened again showing the sidebar.  I had to:\n\n\n*\n\n*open (with Xcode) the file ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.Preview.plist ;\n\n*Add a new item in Root with item name PVPDFSuppressSidebarOnOpening, item type Boolean and type value YES;\n\n*Save the plist file.\nAfter that, Preview started opening without the sidebar.\n\nA: I was able to get this to work on 10.11.1 by adding a new key to the Preview.app plist.\n\nPVPDFSuppressSidebarOnOpening\n\nYou can use the defaults write command to do this in Terminal.\ncd ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.Preview/Data/Library/Preferences/\n\ndefaults write com.apple.Preview PVPDFSuppressSidebarOnOpening true\n\n\nA: No.\nAt least, none that I am aware of, and I have looked. (I'd be thrilled to find out that I’m wrong!)\nHowever, you can sort of brute-force as solution using Keyboard Maestro.\nHere’s a macro that I made:\n\nIf you aren't familiar with Keyboard Maestro, what this is doing it waiting for Preview.app to launch or “activate” (i.e. if Preview.app is running and you switch to it from another app).\nThen it waits until Preview.app has a window (in most cases that will mean a file has been opened).\nThen it looks to see if the “Hide Sidebar” menu item exists but is not selected.\nIf all of those conditions are met, then it will select the “Hide Sidebar” menu item.\nThis isn’t a perfect solution, by far, but it might be better than nothing :-)\nDownload macro from Keyboard Maestro forums.\n\nA: I needed to use\ndefaults write com.apple.Preview PVPDFSuppressSidebarOnOpening 1\n\nfor it to work.\n", "Q: When do I formally \"Own\" an app from App Store? I'm new to this community. I have some simple question but I can't understand why nobody else ever asked them with below scenario.\nMy Scenario\n\n\n*\n\n*As all we know, sometimes developers make their paid apps, free for a limited time.\n\n*I unfortunately  have a Limited internet in home.\n* What I do in this situation is that I \"Get\" this temporary free apps, and after about 1% of downloading I pause them in order to resume downloading later. *\n\nNotice that all below questions are related to each other like a chain and It's not sensible to ask in three separate question.\nMy Questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*When I formally \"own\" an app (if it's free or paid)? right after pushing the \"Get\" button in App Store OR when downloading has completed ?\n\n*(According to above story) Can I resume this downloads (also when apps get back to paid mode) ?\n\n*If this temporary free apps become paid again, Will I still get new updates for ever since I own them ?\n\n\nPS: when somebody \"purchase\" a paid app, he is \"owner\" of that app. In this question I used word \"own\" in the meaning of \"possession\".\n\nA: *\n\n*Once you tap Get, then confirm it by tapping again, then entering your Apple ID or using Touch ID, and the download starts, then you own it.\nThe download starting is important—if there's not enough space on the device, or the network disconnects first, or anything else prevents the circular progress bar from starting, you don't own the app.\nOnce download has started, you can tap the Stop button to stop the download. The icon changes to an iCloud download icon and you now own the app.\n\n*You can download apps you own from the Purchases list found at the top of the Updates tab on iOS.\n\n*Once the app has been added to your Apple ID, the app will remain on the list regardless of whether the app developer changes the price tier of the app. It won't be removed if the price increases and you can't be charged in the future.\nThis also applies with part 2, as if you purchase the app, then delete it, you can download it again without being charged even if the price tier increases.\n", "Q: Macbook Pro SD card reader is not listed as USB hardware I have 15\" early 2011 MacBook Pro with OS X Mavericks installed.

This feature, included by default, even allows you to block messages and calls performed on FaceTime. \nProcedure:  \n\n\n*\n\n*Open the Contacts app\n\n*Select the contact you want to block and scroll to the bottom of the contact info page.\n\n*Click \"Block Contact\".\n\n", "Q: Trying to get LaTeX work with Anki I'm trying to get LaTeX working on Anki.  I am the only admin on my system but when I try and run the terminal command \"tlmgr update --self && tlmgr install dvipng\" I get an error saying I need to run the program as an admin. I am the admin! How do I run this program? \nNote:  Due to lack of reputation, I am unable to vote or bump any existing material, so I am asking a new question.  The comment to the top answer is identical to my query, hence the identical text.\nHow can I get LaTeX working on Anki?\n\nA: http://ankisrs.net/docs/manual.html#installing-and-assumed-knowledge\n\nAnki’s LaTeX support is not turn-key: it is assumed that you know how to use LaTeX already, and that you have it installed. If you have\n  no experience with LaTeX, please consult one of the many guides\n  available on the internet. If you are having trouble with markup,\n  please ask on a LaTeX forum.\nTo install LaTeX, on Windows use MiKTeX; on OSX use MacTex, and on\n  Linux use your distro’s package manager. Dvipng must also be\n  installed.\nNote On Windows, go to Settings in MikTek’s maintenance window, and\n  make sure \"Install missing packages on the fly\" is set to \"No\", not to\n  \"Ask me first\". If you continue to have difficulties, one user\n  reported that running Anki as an administrator until all the packages\n  were fetched helped. \n\nNote On OSX, LaTeX has only been tested with MacTex and BasicTex. If\n    you use BasicTex, you need to install dvipng separately, with the\n    following command: \n\nsudo tlmgr update --self; sudo tlmgr install dvipng\n\nThe command may not be on the path, so you may need to provide the\n    full path, eg /usr/local/texlive/2014basic/bin/x86_64-darwin/tlmgr.\n\nNote If you are not using the above LaTeX packages, you will need to\n  use the \"edit LaTeX\" add-on to specify the full path to latex and\n  dvipng.\n\nSuperuser access needed, not just admin.  \nP.S.

A small amount of latency wouldn't be an issue really.\nThanks in advance. \n\nA: For cheap & cheerful, maybe something like this - http://www.amazon.co.uk/ClimaxDigital-VCAP800-Capture-Mavericks-Mountain/dp/B00466VIB4\nI've never tried it myself, so I've nothing to go on other than the reviews, which seem varied.\n", "Q: How can I decrease the maximum number of files where Get Info will open multiple windows? Is there some plist I can edit to decrease the number of files that Finder's Get Info function will open separate info windows for?\nThe number of Get Info windows that will open simultaneously is THIRTY-FIVE. The windows slowly appear one at a time, and once they finally finish appearing I have to close them all one at a time. Pure madness, and whoever chose the default value for this feature should go outside and think about what they've done. \nIf I get info on thirty-six files, it finally automatically consolidates them into a Summary Info window. I would like to change this threshold of 36 to something reasonable, like 4.\nI know about the shortcuts to open the Inspector and Summary Info windows, however sometimes I accidentally forget to hold Option or Control, and I would like to eliminate the possibility of this happening by accident. \nA satisfactory alternate solution would be if there were a way to make Get Info always open a Summary Info window instead of opening separate file info windows.\nMacBook Pro (Retina, Mid 2012) running 10.10.5. \n\nA: At least for 10.7.5-10.9.5 the assumption that the number of Get Info windows is restricted to 35 is wrong.\nInstead the screen resolution and the size of the Get Info window seem to be the restricting factors. Using a 1920x1200 px monitor I get 6 windows in a row and 12 rows (= 72 windows).\nTrying to get the info on 73 objects and more a summarizing Get Info window will open.\nApparently there is no simple hidden numerical threshold of simultaneously opening Get Info windows.\nTo simply have an identical behavior for cmdI and altcmdI map cmdI to altcmdI for the Finder.app with a key remapping app.\nIf you don't want to use a remapping app use System Preferences -> Keyboard -> Shortcuts and create custom Finder shortcuts: Get Info -> shiftaltcmdI (to disable cmdI) or Get Info -> altcmdI and Show Inspector -> cmdI to swap the shortcuts of Get Info and Show Inspector. The same applies to Get Summary Info (with a different shortcut of course) if you prefer to change that one.\n\nTo quickly close all Get Info windows hit altcmdW or for some system versions alt-click on the close button of one of the windows. All other non-Get Info windows will also be closed though. \n", "Q: What is /Volumes/firmwaresyncd?

Is it related to the firmware 0day hack from July? \nI'm on 10.11, 2012 mbp.\n\nA: The firmwaresyncd system is Apple designed and expected to run at all normal boots. Perhaps the system didn't unmount it once the check was complete.\nIf you restart your Mac, I've not seen it stay mounted twice in a row, and if you get it always sitting, a support call to Apple might be in order to be sure your firmware is updated if you are running OS updates when asked to. I don't think it's cause for concern immediately, but making sure you would be prompted if you were out of date is a good thing to double check that your security and patches are up to date.\n", "Q: Creating a partition in unallocated space I left some unallocated space on my external HD (around 200 GB) and now I would like to create a partition on it using gpt in terminal since the Disk Utility tool on El Capitan is not even showing the free space, though it did show on Yosemite, but nothing would happen after clicking apply.

Without the aforementioned USB Installer then OS X Internet Recovery is the only way to get what originally shipped on your Mac back.\nNote: If in the past you had downloaded the full Installer for OS X Mavericks from the App Store but no longer have it you can still download it again from the App Store under Purchased and then create a USB Installer from it.\nBe sure you are properly backed up before proceeding to reinstall, by whatever means.\n\nA: Downgrading isn't possible, only erasing and starting from scratch.\nYou can always make a backup of your data, then manually restore it to your MacBook after you install Mavericks. I'd recommend just an external HD to copy all of your home folders (Desktop, Music, Documents, etc.); then when you finish setting up Mavericks, just copy the data back.\n", "Q: Multiple Displays Crashes with El Capitan My dad has a Mac Pro (2009 era) and runs 3 monitors hooked up with DisplayPort. They are not high-res and only about 24\". Nothing that a Mac Pro should have any issues with. Everything worked well until he upgraded to El Capitan last week. Almost immediately, it crashed to the login screen. I spent a while troubleshooting the problem and all of the crash reports point to graphics problems (which seems apparent). Right now, he is down to one monitor to mostly rule out the crashes. I found that disabling \"each display on it's own space\" helped, but if he is working with one display and a notification comes in on the other one, it will consistently crash. \nI'm not sure what else to try. Is there a way that we could get him back up to the three monitors? I understand that these problems could point a potential graphics card problem, but I don't think that is the problem considering the direct correlation to the OS upgrade and the crashing. I also haven't been able to find others with similar problems.\nI have tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Multiple Reboots\n\n*Disable: \"Preferences -> Mission Control -> Displays have separate Spaces\"\n\n*Disable: \"Preferences -> Mission Control -> Automatically rearrange Spaces based on most recent use\"\n\n*Confirm that \"Automatic Graphics Switching\" didn't exist on his machine\n\n*More reboots\n\n\nA: This problem is well documented on the Apple forums. For the moment, until the next release of El Capitan, you can only run two monitors. The monitors must be connected to one video card. You do not have to remove the other card.\nPlease search the Apple forums for more details.\n\nA: Update:\nAn OS 10.11.x update fixed the problem. If you are still experiencing this problem, make sure that you are on at least OS 10.11.3\n\nHe was able to get an improvement (but not a fix) by resetting the NVRAM on his Mac Pro. He still experiences a number of crashes throughout the day, but at least he is running all three monitors and is still able to work somewhat efficiently. \nHe was unable to install the drivers recommended by @Stig, even though they did look somewhat promising. \n\nA: Upgrading Graphics Card didn't work for me, I have an Early 2009 Mac Pro running the latest version of El Capitan and the only monitor that will work for me is my 2004 Apple Cinema Display that uses DVI or screw in cable (not mini DisplayPort) For some reason My 24\" Apple LED Cinema Display will not stay on. It goes black but if I shine a light into the display I see that it still has a picture but no backlighting. When I initially plug it into the Mac Pro it flickers but doesn't stay on. Even when it's plugged in my itself or duel with two monitors and every single time the 2004 monitor lights up great and works. What is going on with Apple and El Capitan and the compatibility with Mini DisplayPort and Cinema Displays. For me it didn't seem to matter whether it was one or two monitors the LED display just won't fire.\nYou could try an SMC reset and reset the ParameterRAM or Pram. Those things seem to help some people. (not me in my case)\nWhat did seem to help temporarily until I shutdown. (Just leave your computer on if it works!!! Until Apple has an El Capitan update.\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut Down computer it it's not already shut down\n\n*Unplug all peripherals and computer for 30 seconds\n\n*Plug in computer to power and one monitor\n\n*Start-up and check to see if monitor is working\n\n*If monitor is working, then plug in second and then third display and restart\n\n\nGood Luck, hope Apple soon fixes this issue. I really like my 24\" LED Cinema Display and it's sad that I have to use my 2004 model on my early 2009 Mac Pro that is still VERY NICE!\n\nA: New drivers released from Nvidia for El Capitan:  \nQuadro & GeForce MAC OS X driver release 346.03.02\n", "Q: Living with notifications in a many-tabbed world I like notifications.

Yesterday, I've run into a weird problem on my early 2015 MacBook Air.\nI was copying over some files from a Windows 7 VM (Fusion 8.0.1) when all of a sudden my host OS' interface ran all sluggish and laggy. Things like switching between Desktops / full screen apps stuttered and opening apps took way longer than normal.\nEvery sane computer user would probably reboot as step #1 - and that's what I did 3 times - to no avail. Stutter continued. Welp.\nNext up was resetting SMC and PRAM; shortly after, the lag issue vanished. Seems to be running just fine now, maybe even a tad bit faster than previously (should note that I upgraded from Yosemite, it was no clean install).\nAll good now, or so I thought. Opened the preferences panel of one of my VMs in Fusion just to notice something odd. I can't tell whether it is an El Capitan thing that I just happen to have noticed right after those lag issues, or if they are somehow related. Basically, clicking and holding on any of those icons would make them glitch out weirdly (check out the image below).\nNow for my question: Any idea how to fix this? Is there any cache that I could clear to force it to reload those interface elements? Or is it actually an El Capitan issue?\nI googled this and couldn't find anything. Tried manually uninstalling and reinstalling Fusion completely, didn't help. Tried recovery, repairing disk, tried single user / safe mode, didn't help either.\n\n\nA: Not sure this is going to fix it since I haven't experienced it myself yet, but I had issues in the past on older versions of OSX where some toolbar icons would get garbled and booting into safe mode would fix it.\nThough documented on this Apple support page, the short of it is that you need to reboot and hold down the shift key after the startup sound plays (release after the Apple logo appears). The computer will boot and run much slower, but it is doing a bunch of housekeeping in the process. Let it complete loading and log in to your desktop and then at some point you can reboot again (no shift this time) and hopefully things are back to normal.\n\nA: Maybe you could have tried booting once into safe mode (hold down Shift during chime) and then back to see if clearing some icon caches would have helped. \n", "Q: \"Glitched\" pixels, El Capitan, formula box in numbers Today I installed El Capitan on my Macbook Pro and noticed some weird graphical effects when I was editing my numbers document:\n\nI know that this is entirely software-related, otherwise the screen shot tool couldn't have captured it, and it turns on and off randomly, with mouse-overs and hovers.\nDoes anyone know a possible cause and fix of this?\nMy Macbook:\n\n\n*\n\n*MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2015)\n\n*Graphics Intel Iris Pro 1536 MB\n\n*OSX El Capitan Version 10.11\n\n\nMy Display:\n\n\n*\n\n*Built-in Display\n\n*15.4-inch (2880 x 1800)\n\n*Intel Iris Pro 1536 MB\n\n\nA: Well, it doesn't happen to me anymore so if anyone else is having this problem I'd recommend:\n\n\n*\n\n*restarting your computer (I did this)\n\n*Updating your OS (I am updating every time as soon as a new update comes out)\n\n", "Q: Remove iterm from cmd+tab apps I was using TotalTerminal to get visor like terminal on a shortcut.

Each has a preference to run in the \"foreground\" or the \"background\" and when you make a change to that preference, you have to quit and re-launch the app for the system to know how to handle the dock, windows and menu bar as well as the application switcher.\n\nI see no sign that iTerm 2 has this functionality, so at best you will need to modify the application or recompile it if it's ready to go and just lacks the preference toggle in the application. My suspicion is the application will need more programming added to handle both cases and you'll need to live with that app in the switcher or choose a different terminal emulation tool.\nBasically, the OS can accommodate an app designed to opt out of the dock and the app switcher, but it's not as simple as setting one preference on any app you want to change.\n", "Q: How to install ruby gems without sudo I want to install a Ruby Gem to my computer, but since I don't have an administrator account I can't use sudo.

I understand that the files within this folder are all cache files. My only question is why this is happening, and what makes this happen? Is there any way to make it only cache apps that are actually open, or do I have to refresh my NVRAM/PRAM? It's exceedingly annoying to have my computer act like its trying to buffer 20 gigabytes all at once.\n\nA: I have had the same problem with the huge \"folders\". The command looks like a quick way to go and I'll try this out next time I get the big files appearing.\nI manage over 400 macs and this issue has been happening since 10.9 through 10.10 and now it seems 10.11. The strange thing is that it is only apparent on a certain model of iMac, 2GHZ Intel Core 2 Duo, Macs. All the other later iMacs we use dont seem to have the problem at all.\nI first noticed this problem when our helpdesk got calls from students who couldnt save work and when I checked these macs the hard drives were almost full(150GB hard drives). I manually trashed the var/folders some of which were over 100GB and the space was released but the iMacs gradually fill up again.\nI havent cleared any of these Macs lately to see if the 10.11 El Capitan upgrade has fixed this issue.\n\nA: The answer is that yes, you are allowed to delete files from /private/var/folders/. The command\nsudo rm -r -P /private/var/folders/tr/*\n\nwas able to work and no crashes came of it. Some errors were issued by the command, but no errors came from the system as a whole. I might issue a new post later on when I know more about this to understand what Apple did with El Capitan to make it act this way. \nHere's a thread from the Apple website about this; it agrees that deleting tr should be safe. According to the thread, /var/folders is the new location of caches, which you can safely delete if you've closed all running apps.\n\nUPDATE: Another reason for this behavior can be due to Spotlight indexing, especially on older models of MacBook / MacBook Pro. I recently noticed the problem happening again, and even though I had done everything I could to prevent it from continuing to happen, I was forced to watch my Mac slowly consume more than 100 gigabytes of space to some phantom process occurring in the background.\nEven so, be sure to go into Settings -> Spotlight & uncheck the box for Folders indexing, and if you're like me and have a lot of music (such as over 50 gigabytes), turn off Music indexing, too. Turn off any others you may not want, as well, but Folder indexing seems to be the biggest culprit in both disk space loss and performance slowdown on older MacBook models.\nUpon turning this off, I have not seen any issues. Additionally, the remaining disk space displayed in Finder now provides accurate results.\nThis may also apply to iOS devices, since OS X & iOS are currently being developed to match each other's functionality and features. A large portion of the Other data stored on the device may  just be Spotlight indexing not giving a toot about how much disk space it consumes. It won't hurt to try turning some features / options off if you notice issues.\n\n\nA: I'm unsure if this will work in everyone's case (and I know this is an old thread), but a good old-fashioned reboot is often all it takes to clear up these cache files:\nhttp://osxdaily.com/2016/01/13/delete-temporary-items-private-var-folders-mac-os-x/\nOf course, this method may not work on all setups, however I recommend this method because there are several websites which do NOT recommend deleting items in /var/folders, /private/var/folders/ or /tmp. \nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/3757828\n\nA: I had the same problem on El Capitan (MacOS 10.11).

Let it stay powered off for 30 seconds. Restart holding down command-r (as noted here and in one answer below).  It chimes, goes through 3/4 of one progress bar, starts another progress bar, goes through half, then says \"Install OS X\" and looks exactly like the (failing) 'El Capitan' upgrade. It has ignored my command-r I believe. This page says \"It's possible that you didn't press Command-R early enough.  Restart and try again.\" I think that is unlikely, since I held it down right from the start.\nEdit 2: Restart has a menu, with \"Disk Utilities\", \"Terminal\", etc. When I try to quit the installer, it wants me to choose another startup disk. Once it didn't like \"Macintosh HD\" as a choice, but then on a second round it was fine.  When I try to repair the disk, I get \"file system check exit code is 8\", so I think the disk is hard to repair, (perhaps because it is mounted?).

Something possessed me last night to hit upgrade to High Sierra. \nThe download went fine but when I said install the computer got stuck in the loop, of can't install the update because \"your computer file system verify or repair failed\" and no matter what I did I could not get out of this loop. I tried to boot form recover, boot form USB with sierra installer, tried to repair the hard drive which gave me errors like File system check exit code is 8, I tried single user mode, I tried network recovery..... like I said I tried everything. My plan was to dig up the old spinning hard drive to restore an image form it, albeit it few months old but better than nothing. Of course I do not have a backup because I said to myself this is an SSD on a mac what could go wrong, well I learned that lesson. Bottom line what needed to happen was enable journaling of the hard drive, something that was greyed out and was impossible to do. Installing a fresh OS was also not working because the computer would say the drive is locked. Enough of the problem here is the solution.\nI bought a thunderbolt cable to connect the iMac to my trusted MacBook Pro. I then installed Disk Warrior software on a MacBook pro. Then I booted the iMac while holding down the t key, which allowed the MacBook to see the iMac as an external drive. Disk Warrior scanned the iMac's hard drive, rebuilt its directory and enabled journaling. I then unmounted the iMac from the MacBook and rebooted the iMac normally, and viola, high Sierra installation proceeded and 40 minutes later I am back to normal. I am considering this post and pay back for all the help I got from searching the net for hours on this issues.\n\nA: Force-restart in to Internet Recovery and use that to run disk utility. If that doesn't fix your disk you might have broken hardware.\n\nA: Notice there is an installer menu.\nChoose quit from the installer menu.\nIf it won't allow you to choose 'Macintosh HD', restart (and go through the whole failed install) until it does.\n\nA: I had the same problem, my issue was that Macintosh HD was formatted as Mac OS X Extended instead of the (Journaled). \n\nA: Use the DVD that came with the MacBook Pro:\n\n\n*\n\n*Start using the original DVD by holding down Option Key during startup. \n\n*Then go to Disk Utility and repair disk.\n\n*Restart the macbook normally and this time it will upgrade the OS nicely.\n", "Q: mail activity window in el capitan Since upgrading to el capitan a couple of days ago, activity window in mail does not work.

Simple enough, right?  Not on OS X, apparently.\nAfter digging around the Internet and a phone call with Apple Support, who suggested it was our routers (!!), I'm hoping someone here may have a deeper understanding of what's going on here.\nI released the address from our internal Linux/ISC DHCPD server manually (it was deleted, server restarted).\nI found and XML file generated at /var/db/dhcpclient/leases/en2-1,18:af:61:b7:7d:0 (for whichever device/MAC). Removing this file had no effect. OS X still insists on renewing the address it has had. Our default lease is 24 hours.\nRebooting the Mac after the above had no effect.  ipconfig, unplump/plumb the interface had no effect.\nThis leads me to believe that OS X is storing this information in some obscure database that I'm unaware of.   As for the documentation, well it basically sucks and didn't tell me much of anything.\nDoes anyone know how to force the Mac to forget about it's DHCP acquired IP address, completely, and request a new address from the server? \nThanks in advance.\n\nA: I find that changing the value of DHCP Client ID will sometimes generate a new DHCP address when rebooting the Mac and/or router will not.\n\n", "Q: xld crashes with El Capitan After upgrading to El Capitan (No complains apart of this one) XLD does not work anymore.\nWhen I try to rip a CD, XLD crashes and I get the following trace back:\nProcess:               XLD [79196]\nPath:                  /opt/homebrew-cask/*/XLD.app/Contents/MacOS/XLD\nIdentifier:            jp.tmkk.XLD\nVersion:               20141129a (148.2)\nCode Type:             X86 (Native)\nParent Process:        ???

However, I often close all tabs except the pinned tabs. However, unless I make one of the pinned tabs active and then close the other tabs it closes the whole window, pinned tabs and all.\nFor example, let's say I have one pinned tab and one not. If the unpinned tab is active and I hit command+w the whole window closes. But if I make the pinned tab active and then click the close button on the unpinned tab, the window stays open. Any way to keep the window open as long as there are any tabs open, pinned or otherwise?\n\nA: If you watch the File menu, you can see ⌘W changes depending on the number of open tabs. If there are multiple, it's \"Close Tab\", if there is one (not counting the pinned), it's \"Close Window\".\nThere is a workaround! You can overwrite ⌘W to always execute \"Close Tab\".\nGo to System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > App Shortcuts \nAdd a Shortcut for the application \"Safari\", menu item \"Close Tab\", shortcut ⌘w.\nIf you're not using English in Safari, lookup the exact name of the menu item for closing a tab. In the Dutch version of Safari, the menu item is called \"Sluit tabblad\".\n\nA: Just want to add to hachre's answer that you can achieve the same result using terminal.\nFor overwrite ⌘W in Safari execute following lines:\ndefaults write com.apple.Safari NSUserKeyEquivalents -dict-add 'Close Tab' '<string>@w</string></dict>'\ndefaults write com.apple.universalaccess com.apple.custommenu.apps -array-add '<string>com.apple.Safari</string>'\n\nThen reload Safari:\nkillall Safari\nopen -a Safari\n\nI use that commands in Sierra - works great.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro updated to EL Captain 10.11 but QuickTime Player didn't upgrade The ONLY reason I upgraded to EL Captain because the new QuickTime Player allows me to make a video of my app while I play on my device.

El Capitan’s new split view is an interesting feature. At last, OS X users have a feature at their disposal that has long been available on various Linuxes or on Windows. However, I have not yet found any way to enter it with the keyboard alone, without any mouse or trackpad interaction.\nYes, I am a keyboard junky and I think the ⊞ Win + ← or → keyboard shortcuts that are available on Windows or on many Linuxes are very handy. I would appreciate anything similar – a setting, a menu entry, or even an extra app or script.\nThe BetterTouchTool allows for setting keyboad shortcuts for Maximize Window Left and Maximize Window Right. However, that is not quite the same, since it does not make use of the proper split view.\nSo, is there a way to enter the split view with a keyboard shortcut?\n\nA: BetterTouchTool (starting with version 1.22, currently available as alpha version) let's you assign gestures or keyboard shortcuts to trigger the native split screen.\n\nA: There doesn't seem to be any way to achieve this. I've trawled the web in search of an answer. \nWhen I first moved to Mac from Linux, I picked SizeUp for this kind of window manipulation. It's the best tool I could find that has a full range of keyboard shortcuts. I'll be sticking with it for the foreseeable future. (It costs $12.99 but the free trial version doesn't expire)\n\nA: You may also consider Spectacle, which explicitly apes the winkey+arrow behavior from Windows 7/8/10.\n\nA: I've used BetterTouchTool which has now branched into BetterTouchTool and BetterSnapTool to resize windows using programmable multitouch gestures and keyboard shortcuts.\nLink to BetterSnapTool in the app store: https://itunes.apple.com/en/app/bettersnaptool/id417375580?mt=12\n\nA: I just saw that the BetterSnapTool, a dedicated spin-off of the BetterTouchTool, claims it supports the Split View, see BetterSnapTool El Capitan Compatibility.\nUnfortunately, I have not been able to test the trial version. It does not open, probably because I had already tested a previous version in the past.\n\nA: As a long time Windows user, I find Magnet by CrowdCafe, to be a very nice window snapping tool. \nIt includes keyboard shortcut commands for:\n\n\n*\n\n*Left\n\n*Right\n\n*Up (half)\n\n*Down (half)\n\n*1/4 screen (left top, right top, left bottom, right bottom)\n\n*Max screen \n\n*Multi screen support and others\n\n\nCan be found in the App Store. \nOnly thing missing is the auto adjust slider when apps are side by side and you resize them.\n", "Q: Netflix app on AppleTV crashes and restarts after beginning to play I have had this issue for several months, the AppleTV is up-to-date, I've even done a factory reset, but the same problem is happening, and it appears to be most common on Netflix.\nAfter playing for a few minutes, the app crashes and the system restarts. After digging through the menu to get back to whatever was being watched, it usually plays after the point of failure, but sometimes crashes again at a later point.\nI think I've ruled out:\n\n\n*\n\n*Out of date software (keeping it up to date, auto updates enabled)\n\n*App data that is causing a failure (factory reset should fix that)\n\n*Hardware failure (since it's most common with Netflix)\n\n\nLast week I turned on the feature to send usage data to Apple so that if a crash report was being generated in the background, it would go to Apple Developers.\nHas anyone else had a similar problem? Or does anyone have any ideas about how I can diagnose this problem? I can't find logs anywhere, I feel like I'm working in the dark here,\n\nA: Try reducing the playback setting for Netflix to Medium. This needs to be done through the Netflix web site. Netflix warns this may take up to 8 hours to take effect. Also note it is supposedly profile specific. So make sure you are using the same profile on your Apple TV and for adjusting the setting. Seems to have helped for my frequent crashes. \n", "Q: Disable pinned tabs being in every window in Safari 9 Is there any way to disable pinned tabs showing up in every Safari window? I typically have several Spaces going and the pinned tabs are only relevant to those spaces or even just to the specific Safari window.\n\nA: No, that's the design intent of pinned tabs. They are pinned to the app and not a window / document.\nIf you don't wish to have the tabs shown in all windows but still want easy access, bookmark many tabs with shift-command-D and you can open them with a single click.\n\nA: You can open a new private window and those will be gone\n\nA: Ok so MY take on why a pinned tab shouldn't show up in every window is this:\n\n*\n\n*a \"pinned\" tab means that when I start the browser from scratch, that FIRST window opens with my pinned tabs. Every subsequent window I open is just a blank window. I may even drag a tab out to create a new window... that doesn't mean I want my pinned tabs in the new window.\n\n*I don't think it's good design to open multiple instances of the same tab every time a window is open. A lot of people (myself included) compartmentalize different goals with sets of tabs in windows. i.e. Development window might have tabs like SO; AWS console; Cloud9; etc, while social may have gmail (pinned); twitter; FB; reddit; etc.\n\n*Chrome runs a separate process for each tab, with the intention that 1 bad tab doesn't bring down the whole application. Not sure if Safari treats it the same way (webkit right?), but if it does then multiple copies of the same pinned tab seems wasteful.\n\n*If I have 3 windows open, each with a pinned Gmail tab, I should be able to close 2 of them and keep the 1 pinned tab on the social/comm window. However, current behavior is that closing the pinned tab on 1 window closes it on all windows.\n\nSo, am I right? I am to me, and probably others who view pinned tabs the same way, but that doesn't make me right for everybody. I think this could be an option/preference item going forward to help us all enjoy a peaceful coexistence ;)\nSomebody asked for an expansion of this view beyond \"it's really not\", so this is my take.\n", "Q: Ios 9 update error My iPad is stuck at connect to iTunes when uploading to IOS 9.

I don't have a landline Internet at home, so \"use WiFi\" is not a solution to the problem.\nSpecs: \n\n\n*\n\n*Verizon iPhone 6S Plus 128 GB (CDMA)\n\n*Unlimited LTE cellular data plan with hotspot feature enabled on the account, allowing legal USB, WiFi and Bluetooth tethering as supported by the iPhone's \"Personal Hotspot\" built-in feature, which is activated by Verizon when they detect that I have Hotspot enabled on my account.\n\n*Not Jailbroken. Unwilling to Jailbreak in order to implement a solution to this problem.\n\n\nFor comparison, if I take out my SIM card and put it into any Android smartphone, I can receive a call over VoLTE or CDMA on the same network, at the same physical location, and use LTE data at the same time. So, no, it is definitely not a limitation of the network. The network supports simultaneous data and voice if your data is coming from LTE, which mine always is, even if the call comes in over CDMA at the same time.\nAnd, since the 6S Plus supports VoLTE, you'd think that if the call comes in over VoLTE (which I've specifically tested from an Android phone that is definitely also on VoLTE and has great LTE signal strength), that the data would be able to continue simultaneously, right? Nope. The phone seems to be artificially limiting or killing the data, even though there is nothing inherent in the VoLTE protocol that says you can't do a VoLTE call and a data session at the same time.\nHow can I solve this?\nPossible approaches to a solution that I've investigated:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is there some setting to change to force it to not disconnect the LTE when receiving a call?\n\n*Is there some way to always forward incoming calls on the cell # to a VoIP number (Skype, Google Voice, etc.) so that my cellular # never rings? This will prevent me from taking calls when I have no Internet access on my phone, but that's rare enough that I'm willing to accept that as a consequence.\n\n*Lastly, is there a way to keep my LTE enabled but prevent any incoming calls from ringing the phone (and thus disconnecting the Internet)?\n\n\nMy attempts at pursuing these solutions:\n\n\n*\n\n*\nIs there some setting to change to force it to not disconnect the LTE when receiving a call?\n\nNone that I've found.\n\n\n*\n\n*\nIs there some way to always forward incoming calls on the cell # to a VoIP number (Skype, Google Voice, etc.) so that my cellular # never rings? This will prevent me from taking calls when I have no Internet access on my phone, but that's rare enough that I'm willing to accept that as a consequence.\n\nNone that I can find. All the VoIP things I find seem to do the reverse: they'll forward your incoming VoIP calls to your cellular number. That's not what I want. I want the opposite of that.\n\n\n*\n\n*\nLastly, is there a way to keep my LTE enabled but prevent any incoming calls from ringing the phone (and thus disconnecting the Internet)?\n\nDo Not Disturb mode may help me with this (?), but I think it would still momentarily \"hiccup\" the Internet connection, wouldn't it? I think it would, because the phone has to receive the call to decide to ignore it.\nAny better solutions out there? This seems like something basic that I took for granted when I had an Android phone, but now that I switched to iPhone for completely unrelated reasons, I'm finding this to be a very annoying limitation that shouldn't be a limitation at all (because the network allows it, and all of Apple's competitors allow simultaneous voice and data, so why won't Apple?), and I'd like to work around it or directly solve it if possible.\n\nA: You are right when you state that simultaneous data and voice is possible over the LTE connection. There's not a VoLTE-capable network in the world where this isn't the case.\nBut many of your other assumptions, albeit founded on sound logic, are not consistent with reality.\nSo here's what you need to know:\n\n\n*\n\n*Your calls are definitely not occurring over LTE if the data signal drops when you place the call. But your phone is definitely capable of VoLTE (as is Verizon's network).\n\n*Your Android phone has two radios in it, which is why you can maintain your LTE data connection while on a phone call on that phone. The vast majority of Verizon-sanctioned LTE-capable Android phones have two radios in them (although we're starting to see some hit the market with only a single radio now that VoLTE is possible). The phone call goes over 1xRTT while the LTE radio maintains data connectivity.\n\n\nThere are several things to check before opening a trouble ticket with Verizon:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure \"Voice & Data\" is selected in Settings > Cellular > Enable LTE.\n\n*Make sure your Verizon account has the feature called \"Advanced Calling 1.0\" added to it. You can add this through My Verizon yourself (in the same place where you'd activate/deactive the mobile hotspot feature).\n\n*Make sure you are using a newer SIM card. Believe it or not, there are old Nano-SIM cards out there that simply will not support VoLTE. If you need a new one, ask Verizon.\n\n\nIf you've done all of this, there's one more thing to know before opening a trouble ticket: your phone will still prefer 1xRTT phone calls over LTE ones if you're in a marginal service area. And when it does this, since no iPhone has ever supported TX/RX with two cell networks simultaneously, your iPhone will drop LTE and hop straight onto 1xRTT to grab the call.\nIf marginal service is the cause of your problem, then your only solution will be to use a different phone—one that has a dual radio setup. Manufacturers are rapidly moving away from dual radios though, so be careful when purchasing anything new.\nGood luck!\n", "Q: How can the average user easily validate the integrity of their Mac's firmware? How can the average user easily validate the integrity of their Mac's firmware?\nBefore you downvote this question or lecture me on how I am paranoid and no one should ever need to do that, please read below. \nIn July 2015, CVE-2015-3692 revealed that a Mac's EFI firmware could be hacked by a remote attacker. (The vectors available for this are in other CVEs, but could hypothetically be anything, including things like malicious fake Flash update installers.)\nThis vulnerability was made public at least four weeks before Apple patched it on July 30 for OS X 10.8, 10.9, and 10.10 with EFI Firmware Security Update 2015-001.\nThe same security researcher who announced this vulnerability also claims to have seen a demonstration at a conference of a firmware hack that cannot be removed or overwritten.\nTherefore, once a Mac's EFI has been owned, if the attacker did it right, then the only way to reflash the EFI with valid Apple firmware would be to wire up a reflasher directly to the EFI chip on the logic board itself (do not try this at home). \nNews articles that reported this vulnerability downplayed it, saying that most users should not worry, and all you need to do in order to protect yourself is never let your Mac go into sleep mode, and either disable the root user, or never authenticate anything you do not 100% trust. Comment threads on those articles summed it up like this: if all your apps come from trusted sources like the official App Store, and you never run anything that's not code-signed by developer known to Apple, then you should have nothing to worry about.\nBut then in September 2015 we learned about the XCodeGhost exploit, which is known to have resulted in numerous malware-infected apps showing up on the official iOS App Store—but what about OS X apps? In the linked article, Malwarebytes wrote:\n\nWardle pointed out back in March that Xcode was vulnerable to this\n  sort of thing, but frighteningly, also pointed the finger at many\n  other OS X apps. Any of those apps could be vulnerable to similar\n  attacks.\n\nThey also wrote, \"the average user should not panic\"—the same mantra that I often see parrotted on the Apple support forums and elsewhere anytime a user posts a thread about tons of weird problems they are having. \"Just reformat your drive and perform a clean install of the system. The problem is likely a third-party system modification,\" we are told. When that doesn't fix it, people are told it must be a hardware problem, like a failing HDD, failing GPU, or bad RAM. I've seen threads where people replaced literally every component in their Mac, and the problem would always come back. \nNow we know it's hypothetically possible that users' EFI firmware got hacked—so even if their motherboard was replaced, when they'd reinstall their apps, the firmware could just get reflashed again by the malware! And if the motherboard was not replaced, then they'd be hosed no matter what. \nThat brings me back to the main question.\nHow can the average user easily validate the integrity of their Mac's firmware? I.e. how can you check to make sure your Mac's firmware has never been compromised by malware? I could not find any method compatible with El Capitan that does not require disabling SIP. For prior OS versions, there is a complicated third-party tool called DarwinDumper that can dump your EFIs contents to a text file, but you still need to have the valid Apple firmware to compare it against—this is not a method that the average user is capable of doing.\nTelling people not to worry about something they very well could be the victim of, and have no way to check if they are, is what enables these sorts of exploits to be profitable for hackers, who depend upon complacency and a lack of vigilance on the part of users. \n== \nEDIT: I found the latest official Apple firmware installer on Apple's support site. The installer doesn't run on 10.10 or 10.11, oddly. Using Pacifist I extracted the .scap file for my Macbook Pro 9,1. I compared the binary in HexFiend with the biosdump that I pulled using DarwinDump after rebooting into Recovery Mode and running csrutil disable on terminal to disable rootless and enable the ability to run unsigned kexts. I recovered this BIOS header:\n   $IBIOSI$   MBP91.88Z.00D3.B0B.1506081214Copyright (c) 2005-2015 Apple Inc.

At least that tells me I had the latest firmware installed, the one that was released after the hacks were announced. I'm prolly good. Would be nice to be able to confirm I'm good through some kind of checksum verification however! Looking at you, Apple!\n\nA: The title of “how can an average user” is a bit of a danger zone, since I don’t consider anyone that uses Terminal average - not passing judgement, just that the audience here is way above average to even know they should validate firmware. Hopefully I’m not sounding too pretentious with this short summary of what I think the average mac user should do:\nThe macOS installer updates firmware when you install / reinstall the OS, so simply booting to recovery and reinstalling the current version of macOS, you will not lose any programs, settings, data and get a chance to ensure your firmware is up to date. Even if you installed the OS several months ago - if newer firmware is around when the installer checks while getting ready to install, you’ll get that update as part of the exercise.\n\nIf you’re not able or willing to just run an install, then it becomes much more tricky to report / validate you’re really up to date. I suppose it depends on why you think you didn’t get the updates as part of the normal upgrade / update process. Since there’s no general check on all the firmware, I would say the average user cannot validate firmware and even exceptional users are having difficulty performing the level of analysis required. Average users struggle with the difference between authentication and authorization. Expert users find it tedious to verify checksums and cryptographic chains of trust and human nature is we don't do those activities well, even in well engineered, well motivated, well supported environments.\nI would open a support ticket with Apple for each instance where I wanted to verify firmware and participate in the official Apple Security Notifications mailing list so you're in the loop when things change.\nI'm sorry if this isn't the answer you wanted, but I also felt this was my small entry into an answer to everyone that sees your question and wonders how to start on learning. As more users ask apple for support, eventually knowledge base articles will be written. At some tipping point, funding would be added and the problem would be engineered to match the user education levels. We're just in the early days from where I see things.\n\nA: To check the firmware of an Intel UEFI system, such as a Mactel, boot Intel LUV (Linux UEFI Validation) distro, luv-live, run Intel CHIPSEC. It'll check for most of the publicly-known firmware vulnerabilities. You should run CHIPSEC when you first get your box, save the ROM, then occasionally re-run CHIPSEC and compare the ROMs for changes. You can use UEFItool, CHIPSEC, or UEFI-Firmware-Parser, or a handful of other tools to a forensic examination of the ROM. \nFor some more information about the topic and the tools involved, see my slides for a presentation I gave recently.\n\nA: Just an update to this question since a new program is available..\nIt's called eficheck. It's in the /usr/libexec/firmwarecheckers/eficheck directory aka probably not in your path, so it's a little more complex than some others but there is a man page for it that documents its usage. \nIts important to consider that anything modestly sophisticated enough to get into your EFI is likely going to be able evade detection to some degree. That's a lot of the reason antivirus checks are useless, although the people who regurgitate \"antivirus checks are garbage\" have no clue as to why and are repeating the conclusion someone smarter than them drew which is that antivirus companies tend not to know have the ability to properly analyze Mac specific malware so they are not adding a file's unique hash value to their database so your computer can compute the hashs of its own files then those against a database of known malware hashs. Almost all virus scans do nothing more and don't look for malacious behavior.\nAt the end of the day though Apple's EFI is Intel's UEFI so you're trusting Apple to do something correctly that is really complex and technical. Apple can't even figure out their own PKI and have you ever seen the developer manual for an Intel processor? It's thousands of pages of ancient greek. I mean come on you didn't think Apple was pretty and smart, did you? \nThe security mailing list is a simple notification when updates are released and nothing more. You would be in the loop for new patches to long identified and easily exploited CVE-IDed issues affecting the latest OS and older ones aka the ones in use. There's nothing to prevent future exploits in the updates..at least that they will mention ever due to their policy not to speak of such things. The only security items addressed will be to say that a very specific issue has been fixed by the update.\nIf they did identify a \"malware attack\" (it didn't stick around after?), it'd violate their own policy if they were to confirm it and report back to the user as well as be a poor business decision since many of their customers still don't believe in malware. Notice it says nothing about contacting the user or fixing the problem. Could see the headlines now.. All of the bad press lately has been really bruising their ego and seems like its approaching a tipping point. \n\nA: Just as an update, macOS 10.13 High Sierra will automatically verify the integrity of a Mac's firmware once a week. If a problem with the firmware is found, your Mac will offer to send a report to Apple. A post by The Eclectic Light Company says this about the reports;\n\nIf you are running a real Mac, rather than a ‘Hackintosh’, Kovah asks that you agree to send the report. This will allow eficheck to send the binary data from the EFI firmware, preserving your privacy by excluding data which is stored in NVRAM. Apple will then be able to analyse the data to determine whether it has been altered by malware or anything else.\n\nAppleInsider says this as well;\n\nThe report sent to Apple excludes data stored in NVRAM. Apple will then look at the transmitted data to evaluate if there has been a malware attack\n\nCheck here to learn more about this new feature: macOS High Sierra Automatically Performs Security Check on EFI Firmware Each Week \n", "Q: Can't restore nor update iPhone 4S Whenever I try to turn on my iPhone 4S, it comes out with the Apple logo for a few seconds and then turn off.\nTurning it on while holding the + button makes the iTunes screen appear.

I have a iPhone 5S and it's reporting a capacity of 11.8GB. I would have thought that 16GB would mean 16GB?\n\n\nA: You can check on Apple's storage capacity guide here, but in short may be caused by two factors:\n\n\n*\n\n*The system reserves a portion of your storage for itself, system files, system partitions, buffer, metadata, etc. Regarding this, I am not entirely sure how much capacity this stuff uses, but you cannot delete it; iOS needs it to run.\n\n*When they say that the phone includes a 16GB flash drive, they mean 16000000000 bytes (decimal system), which is about 14,89 GB in binary system (1024*1024*1024=1GB). As the guide says:\n\nThe way decimal and binary numeral systems measure a GB is what causes a 32 GB storage device to appear as approximately 28 GB when detailed by its operating system, even though the storage device still has 32 billion bytes (not 28 billion bytes), as reported.\n\n\nA: 16 GB total is still 16 GB.  The amount used by the OS should take up space; therefore, the free space will be reduced.  My phone also shows 11.9 GB total on a 16 GB iPhone 5S with 9.0 GB available.\n\nA: Yes it will take 11.8 GB out of 16 GB because every storage device has to be formatted before it can store data files and the formatting process uses some of the device's storage (the exact amount varies depending on the OS and filesystem in use, it gets quite technical). The storage capacity for iOS devices (like PCs and Macs also) is advertised as unformatted, some quantity of that number will be used by the formatting process and is thus unavailable to the user. This will be the smallest contributor to your \"missing GBs\" issue, but it will make a small difference to your iPhone.\n", "Q: Does Do Not Disturb mode turn off automatically?

If you have something similar that's running in background it could be the problem.\nTo resolve it at the moment I pause all Virtual Machines and everything goes alright now.\nThis is probably related to kernel modules installed by VMWare but I can't find any clue... \n\nA: If you don't want to reinstall, why not run the installer against a clean external USB drive. Does the trackpad work there? Does the trackpad work when you boot to the Recovery HD?\nThose two things will tell you if you have a hardware issue (trackpad won't work anywhere) or a software issue (trackpad either will work in a new user account and not your specific user account) or a system issue (works in Recovery HD but not in your current system.\nBased on where the problem lies, the solutions depend.

In Unix, any user with sudo access can act as any other user using sudo su. This invalidates any imagined privacy of local files for all other users of the same Mac. Is there any (preferably OS-level) way to work around this and give users of a multi-user Mac privacy from a potentially snooping administrator?\nEdit: In my further testing it seems at least Keychain is blocked for the administrator using sudo su. Using security I could see the metadata -- i.e. what websites there were passwords for and titles of secure notes -- but not the contents themselves. And even if I as administrator reset the account password, the login keychain still used the old password. Also of interest, opening GUI apps using open will try to open them for the actual user(in their GUI context, and only if it exists), not in the GUI context of the administrator.\nEdit2: To get into the right frame of mind, imagine a family with one Mac. The kids have been learning about root access and are asking how they can be sure Mom & Dad can't snoop on their files. How do Mom & Dad avoid buying one Mac per kid?\n\nA: Basically all files stored locally are accessible by an admin user (or any user who can run a root shell). This also includes locally stored/cached files held in Dropbox, Google Drive, iCloud etc. \nIf a user wants to prevent an admin looking at his/her file, he/her should create an encrypted DMG using Disk Utility, should not store its password in the Keychain and should take extra care to always unmount the DMG whenever he/she walks away from the computer. \n", "Q: how to fix permission on default apps in el capitan Tr\nTrouble in permission How fix it? permission in group wheel = read only full permission = only system group\n\nA: You cannot modify system files/applications in El Capitan due to System Integrity Protection (SIP): some system locations are completely locked unless you boot into recovery  and disable SIP through csrutil in the command line ('csrutil disable') \nSee http://arstechnica.co.uk/apple/2015/09/os-x-10-11-el-capitan-the-ars-technica-review/ for more.\n", "Q: Paragon NTFS for Mac 14 doesn't see NTFS disk (OS X 10.11 El Capitan) I upgraded my Yosemite to El Capitan few days ago. Also recently Paragon sent me an e-mail with an offer of free upgrade from version 12 to 14. Since I bought ver. 12, I decided to install version 14. As an existing customer I was given a new serial number and I did the activation - everything went good.\nToday I plugged my USB hard drive with NTFS partition as usual (the same disk I used before - nothing has changed). Now Paragon doesn't see it. OS X does. I can read but I cannot write. Am I missing something? Version 14 is fully activated.\nThanks for any help.\n\nEDIT: Link from Paragon makes no sense for me. The reason why I bought this software was to avoid triggering any additional commands. I just want to use my NTFS partition as before in Yosemite. I want to plug in my USB with NTFS and simply put something into it. No formatting (I have stuff on it), repairing etc... :/ Anyone can help? Now this software does nothing.\n\nA: Make sure you have version 14.0.382, previous 14 versions had that problem.\nI had this problem with the version I downloaded from the Paragon free upgrade link.\nI solved that problem by downloading the 14.0.382 from their website. Strangely the new version didn't show up clicking the \"check for update\" button on Paragon NTFS preference pane.\n\nA: Also am having dreadful problems with NTFS v14 & Paragon's licensing system, sorry I bought the thing. Have written to support several times now, with no answer (which to my mind, means they know they have problems here):\nAm running on Yosemite as primary boot (with another on a El Cap disk):\n1) v.14 will nor register, claiming it doesn't know my user account details;\n2) conversely, logged into my Paragon user account where I can see all prior registrations for vs 10, 11 & 12, but cannot register v14 and says the s.no is invalid.\n3) tried to uninstall v.14, then on re-boot the drive won't start (hangs, with mac stop sign);\n4) re-build drive form Carbon Copy Cloner image (three times now), uninstall the v14 preference pane, re-install v12 which does register correctly, and on re-start, the boot drive hangs again (that's a 480GB OWC Mercury Accelsior).\nPITA. Not only will version v14 not register against the s.no, it will not see the boot camp disk because it somehow corrupts by boot drive & so the process goes around in circles. Never had any of these issues with vs 10-12, but would seem that Paragon NTFS is far less benign to the mac boot disk than I would have imagined.\nWould seem that the only next choice would be to re-format and clean install a new system & apps from scratch & get rid of Paragon NTFS altogether; find another NTFS solution. Such a time waste of life.\n\nA: It sounds like a permissions issue.  In Disk Utility, run the \"Fix Permissions\" function on the drive and see if that helps.\n\nA: You need to check the permissions in your Paragon.app (control click, read information i guess) you'll find what you're looking for in the end.\nExample :\n\nClick on the lock to make the necessary changes.\nIf you can't change those values you may need to disable System Integrity Protection - SIP (which is activated in El Captain by default) by booting into single user mode and running csrutil disable.\nGood luck\n\nA: Could you please collect \"sysdiagnose\" logs and submit it to feedback@paragon-software.com?

If it fails, you have a hardware issue. If it works, then you can try loading your data from the backup and then trying one final time to see if the hardware and OS that work to save your fingerprint also work with your apps and settings.\n\nA: Ugh, so this is not a good answer - especially for others who might have this situation. But it just came good all on its own.\nI rebooted it a few times, but I did not have the ability to take a backup at the moment (left my lightning cable at home). So I was just going to put up with it until I could do what bmike suggested.\nThen when I went to unlock the phone I happened to use my non-deleted finger and it just worked. I was then able to re-enrol my deleted thumb painlessly.\n", "Q: 'root' user changed to 'dovenull' after disabling SIP I upgraded Yosemite 10.10.5 to El-Capitan over the last 2 days, and also disabled SIP. .. and because I do a lot of building of my own things like postfix and dovecot, I didn't notice until today that I no longer have a root user, and where 'root' should appear, it's ownership is now 'dovenull' - a user name related to dovecot.

I'd like to know the total screen-on time since I plugged off my MacBook from the charger, but apparently there are no easily found stats for it.\nDo I need an external app? I'm using MacBook Air 2015 with El Capitan.\n\nA: I don't think that's something that Apple provides anywhere, however if you put in a little scripting work it's definitely doable. You can get the current brightness on the display with this command:\nioreg -l | awk '/ApplePanelRawBrightness/ {print $NF}'\n\nA '0' result means the backlight is completely off. The upper limit depends on your specific hardware. You can get the highest possible number for your hardware with:\nioreg -l | awk '/AppleMaxBrightness/ {print $NF}'\n\nYou could set up a cron job to run that every minute, and record the result and current time, e.g. in a CSV file. You could then use a spreadsheet program to do the calculation. Or, you could use a higher level language like Python or Ruby to do the same thing and automate the calculation in your script. The latter would be my approach.\nEDIT: I just noticed the 'on battery' part of the question - dunno how I managed to miss that. You can get a simple Yes or No answer to whether the AC adapter is connected using this command:\nsystem_profiler SPPowerDataType |grep Connected | awk '{print $2}'\n\n\nA: Go to Activity Monitor app on the Launchpad, then click on Energy tab.

Can I install apps on a device locked to a specific icloud account?\n\nA: A phone that is activation locked denies you all functionality around the USB port while the iOS runs as well as all functionality of the multitouch screen other than being able to connect to a network or make an emergency phone call.\nYou can put the device into restore mode and re-load an iOS version on iTunes if that version is currently signed by apple, but after that, you are still denied the USB and multitouch functionality needed to complete the setup assistant screens or connect the device over USB to a computer for meaningful work.\nSee How can I bypass Activation Lock? for details on why Activation Lock is hard to bypass.\n", "Q: El Capitan frozen boot process Just thinking:\nI have been reading a \"lot\" of users who's system just did not starts once it has been turned off or after a restar command.\nSome things in common: Virtual machines, Boot camp, multiple partitions, I exactly do not know what could it be.

I am thinking about attaching an external HD to my Airpot (ac), which I will use to back up my computer using SuperDuper on a nightly basis. However, I am concerned about security. I know that I can set a password to access the disk. But is the disk available via the internet? I'm concerned that someone outside my network might be able to access the disk.\n\nA: Disks connected to an Airport router aren't, by default, accessible from the Internet. This is for a few reasons:\n\n\n*\n\n*Your ISP is almost certainly running firewalls that would make it hard to do this anyway.\n\n*By default, disks are only accessible from your local network.\n\n\nThat said, it's possible to make a disk accessible from the Internet if you want to - see this post on the Apple support forums.

Would anyone know how to make Anki work with Latex? Thanks for your help!\n\nA: I found the answer here Anki+Latex. \nBasically you have to download this Anki add-on, which allows you to edit the path Anki uses to find latex and dvipng. Then you use which latex and which dvipng (on Mac terminal) to get the full path to each of them, and then you use the add-on to modify Anki's path.\n\nA: Updated for 2020: You can find LaTeX installation instructions in the Anki User Manual here.\n\nTo install LaTeX, on Windows use MiKTeX; on OSX use MacTex, and on Linux use your distro’s package manager. Dvipng must also be installed.\n\nFor example, on Mac you can run brew install --cask mactex and that should be all you need to get it working with Anki. I had the same error as you, and this process fixed it for me.\nYou can then use Anki's Tools > Check Media... to generate all LaTeX images and sync them to AnkiWeb in order to use them on mobile devices.\n\nA: I had this problem because I had copied in an apostrophe that LaTeX didn't like. You might want to try checking your LaTeX compiles elsewhere first.\n", "Q: Is there a way to turn off iOS 9 update reminders? The answers to this question imply that the reminders do not recur... but that's for versions prior to iOS 9. \nMuch like with newer versions of OSX, iOS 9 will remind you every other day or so to update giving only the options to \"update now\", \"remind me later\", \"view details\". The third option is the only way to avoid \"scheduling\" a reminder later and it's my go-to option in OSX to shut the reminders off for a bit... but I don't want to stop in the middle of what I'm doing to switch over to the Settings app and then go right back to the app I was actually using.\nThis is very annoying to me, particularly as I intentionally skip updates. Is there a way to turn this \"feature\" off?\n\nA: This is kind of a yes/no question. No, most people can't or won't be bothered to turn them off. Yes - you can turn off all network access or block the update servers. \nThe iOS 9 itself does not have a toggle you can flip and the software is designed to let you know the update is available. I'll leave my opinion aside whether Apple designed this correctly, but from a security standpoint. If you are on iOS 9 - upgrading to patch levels doesn't break existing apps and solves known security, performance, energy efficiency and bug issues, so declining a 9.0.x or 9.x update is far harder to justify than just not upgrading to 9.0 in the first place.\nThe best technical way to block iOS 9 updates is hosted on JAMF Nation discussions:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://jamfnation.jamfsoftware.com/discussion.html?id=16955\nThis involves blocking two URLs on your firewall (could be useful if you're using a Wi-Fi only iPad at home): \nappldnld.apple.com\nmesu.apple.com\n\nYou'll want to have control over your network, have an MDM and the energy to configure your devices to avoid updates. Basically, preventing this is a short term battle and I know it makes sense to try it from time to time or if your organization needs to buy time - but it's a pain since the design is to push updates on each device that connects to the internet.\n\nA: TLDR - Go to General > Storage & iCloud Usage > Manage Storage (under Storage) > Select the update item (should have the settings icon and named iOS 9.x.x) > Delete Update\n\nThere is a much easier solution to the nagging reminders explained in the following link.\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/message/29004014#29004014\n\nYes there is a way to disable it. First let me explain why you are getting that notification. Even if you have automatic updates turned off, the new IOS update still downloads to your phone and iPad. It is already in your phone and iPad right now waiting for you to completely install it. It is not installed but it is sitting there in your phone and iPad waiting for you to click on it to install. So what you must do is the following:\nClick on the Setting icon. Then click on General. click on Storage & iCloud  usage. It might just say Storage on your device. When the next page pops up you will see at the top the word Storage. Under it you will see Manage Storage. Click on it and wait till the list is fully populated. Depending on how many apps you have this can take a couple of seconds to about half a minute. Look through this list till you see the new iOS update. Delete it. Then your pop up notice should go away. Don't worry about loosing the update. You can always get it later in the future. If in the future you get the pop up again, then that means Apple has again downloaded it to your phone or iPad without your permission. Simply do the above all over again to delete it and get rid of the new pop up. This is the only way to get rid of the pop up without installing it.\n\n\nA: There's no other way around. The above feature is hard-coded in to the existing iOS. The only solution is:\nAdd the following entry in your router to block the DNS:\nmesu.apple.com,     23.73.181.0/24\n\nOr if you have Raspberry Pi functioning as router, add the following in iptables:\nsudo iptables -A FORWARD -i eth1 -d 23.73.181.0/24 -j DROP #mesu.apple.com\n\nAlthough I am using Apple's product, there is never any resason for my access any of hosts owned by Apple, Inc. So I am blocking all Apple hosts:\nsudo iptables -A FORWARD -i eth1 -d 17.0.0.0/8 -j DROP #apple.com\n\n\nA: A much simpler way is to use existing ad blocking apps to block your iPhone/iPad from checking Apple's server - specially mesu.apple.com and applednld.apple.com. These apps filters traffic coming in to you iPhone via a dummy VPN or a proxy auto-config file.\nI personally used Weblock on my iPad. There are other apps such as, Adblock or Adguard Pro, that will do the trick too. Note that Safari content blockers won't work. \nThe overall idea is similar to the other answers here, but since it is not applied on your router, only your iPhone is affected.\n", "Q: Change OS X server website default location I have OS X El Capitan and OS X server 5.0.4 installed.

I already removed all Xcode stuff in /Library/Server/Web/Config/apache2/sites configuration file but it's not working.\n\nA: This has to do with removing a configuration file, that is used by the server, for wiki and Xcode.  All that's in the file is a bit saying YES service is active, you could probably just change that to NO, but deleting the file works for starters.  And as long as you don't restart the Xcode service the file won't get recreated!\nSee this thread: Cannot change default webpage\n\nIt appears to be a bug.  The short answer is to remove/rename this file:\n/Library/Server/Web/Config/apache2/other/COM.APPLE.WEBAPP.WIKI.conf\nNote, that you can turn the Wiki service on and then remove/rename this file and the Wiki and Web service will work fine (and with the correct index order).  However, turning the Wiki service off and back on will recreate the file and thus cause the issue to reappear.  To address that issue I wrote a simple BASH script to check if the file exists and if so, delete it.  I then made a LaunchDaemon to run the script every 15 seconds.\n\nand:\n\nBut as an added bonus, my problem wasn't wiki, it was Xcode, and the same goes >for removing:\n/Library/Server/Web/Config/apache2/other/COM.APPLE.WEBAPP.XCODE.conf\nI am thinking about changing the YES to NO in the file tho to see if that keeps >things on lockdown incase of restarts...\n\n\nA: Here is Apple's response to this issue:\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-ie/HT205290\nTo summarize, they say to rename or delete the file.\n", "Q: iPhone sends iMessage, but doesn't show that it was \"delivered\", even though it is So after switching to my new iPhone 6s, I have been sending messages through iMessage.

I deleted almost all apps I don't use atm and searched trough every setting that could use background downloading. The device is downloading non stop (it should be 4-6GB already).\n\nA: I would do three things to narrow down the culprit:\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect to Xcode and look at the console logs for the phone - activity might be logged\n\n*Connect to Instruments and profile the network activity\n\n*Connect to iTunes and make snapshots of the storage sizes (or use storage and usage on iOS) to see what bins are growing over time.\n\n\nYou can turn off iCloud to reduce many downloads, but it really depends on which apps you have installed, how they background data load and what data stores they are configured to pull.

I have a Macbook Pro Retina with the following hardware:\nModel Name: MacBook Pro\nModel Identifier:   MacBookPro11,1\nProcessor Name: Intel Core i5\nProcessor Speed:    2.4 GHz\nNumber of Processors:   1\nTotal Number of Cores:  2\nL2 Cache (per Core):    256 KB\nL3 Cache:   3 MB\nMemory: 8 GB\nBoot ROM Version:   MBP111.0138.B15\n\nI recently updated to OS X El Capitan; I have had the same problem occur to me twice now and it's getting me mildly concerned.\nI randomly have CPU usage spikes from kernel_task, the highest of which I have seen was 660% CPU. This is frankly an unacceptable and unnatural setting for my CPU (I typically have a total usage of about 2-3%). The highest I've screenshot is this:\n\nThe first time, I did not record what I had open. The next time, however, I was ready, and this is the exact list of what I had open:\n\n\n*\n\n*Two YouTube video pages (using the processes Safari Networking with a max of about 44% CPU, typically stabilized at 8-10% and https://www.youtube.com, which got to around 51% CPU max, typically around 10-12%)\n\n*Messenger. Doubtful that this had an effect, but, hey, you never know.\n\n*Skype. This dude was running at a consistent 50% CPU usage.\n\n\nIt is worth noting that I had to close both YouTube windows to actually gain enough control of my computer to open Activity Monitor. None of the aforementioned processes were spiking, just kernel_task.\nAlso worth noting is my fans - the fans were on maximum, blowing cold air. Even though kernel_task was spinning at 660% CPU, there was no actual heat being produced, as far as I could see.\nIt's at this point where I force shut down the computer - I had about .5 frames per second (1 frame every 2 seconds, was looking at the clock) and was getting nowhere when it came to even attempting to fix it.\nIf there is a bug related to this that I have missed, or some wacky thing with OS X in general that I'm missing, please let me know, as this is extremely frustrating and more than a little disturbing.\n\nA: High temperature in a part of the chassis from charging together with peripherals plugged in can cause this issue, at least on a 2017 MBP. Simply moving the charging cable from the left to the right ports can be enough to cool the hotspot and resolve the problem. On a machine with MagSafe charging try unplugging peripherals from the left ports until the battery is full.\nCPU usage has nothing to do with this, as a hot CPU is throttled by reducing its clockspeed not by scheduling no-op load.\nSee https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/363933/27135 for proof.\n\nA: You have classic symptoms that thermal issues are causing kernel task to preemptively use up CPU to prevent overheating. If you haven't reset the SMC, try that one time. If the System Management Controller is actually stuck, the response to changing thermal measurements might lag or leave blowers on higher than they should be.\n\n\n*\n\n*kernel_task hundreds of % CPU yet cpu frequency is being lowered\n\n*CPU usage is too high with Yosemite and an external monitor\n\n*kernel_task consumes 500% CPU on AC power, sometimes\n\n*MBP early '11 kernel_task over 300% when unplugged\n\n*MacBookAir kernel_task at 300% and rising\nThe answers above all point to things you can do to measure swap, processes, etc... but focus on thermal sensors (hardware issue) or external temperature (environment) which you can cool artificially to remove the slow down that's designed to manage heat.\nIf you can't measure the case temperature accurately with an infrared thermometer, try software like https://bjango.com/mac/istatmenus/ to check on the individual temp sensors and correlate them with the \"spikes in CPU usage\" by kernel_task. Also, resetting the SMC one time might be worth your while. If it's stuck, the response to changing thermal measurements might lag or leave blowers on higher than they should be.\n\nA: Take a look at your fans ! For my Macbook Pro ( 2015 ) it wasn't a software problem. The Mac was completely unusable. I opened the Macbook dusted the fans with a toothbrush. I also cleaned the heatsink. After removing the heatsink, I found that the thermal paste was dry. I cleaned the old thermal paste and put some new paste, with care. Result: no more problems with kernel_task. The fans went from a steady speed of 6000 RPM to 2000 RPM (total silence).\n\nA: I have the same problem with my 2018 Macbook Pro, with maxed-out specs - I think the higher-powered MacBooks are too physically thin to be able to keep cool when using the using the CPU heavily!\nIn order to keep the temperature down, when the cores get too hot, kernel_task starts blocking other processes by taking up lots of idle time, in order to reduce the load on the CPU and bring the temperature down.\nThis has been confirmed by the source code to MacOS: in  https://opensource.apple.com/source/xnu/xnu-4570.71.2/osfmk/kern/thread.h.auto.html, you can see the line:\n#define TH_OPT_GLOBAL_FORCED_IDLE   0x0100  /* Thread performs forced idle for thermal control */`.\n\nA solution, apart from not using the CPU too much for too long, e.g. with too many browser tabs (something I am guilty of almost daily), is to try to keep the machine cool, e.g. with a cooling pad for a MacBook, and I've found Macs Fan Control (free) quite effective at keeping my MacBook cool by running the fans at a higher speed than the OS would normally, including the option to run the fans at full blast.\nOverall I think this is a design fault - recent MacBooks are too thin and have poor ventilation, and can't handle being heavily used for sustained periods of time - the behaviour of kernel_task is designed to stop the laptop cooking itself, but at the expense of the performance which made it so hot in the first place. Sadly, aside from buying a new machine (perhaps not a MacBook, next time!), all we can do is try not use it too heavily for too long and keep it cool.\n\nA: My experience supports the theory that excessive CPU usage causes kernel_task to run high. In my case, it often happens when I have too many browser windows open or YouTube videos playing. \nClosing windows or apps usually solves the problem.\nOther ways to cool things down:\n\n\n*\n\n*Higher fan speed. I use Macs Fan Control from CrystalIdea to manually raise my baseline fan speed to a constant 2500 rpm, or 3000 rpm if needed.\n\n*Using a cooling pad for your laptop.\n\n*Air conditioning! The outside temperature affects the computer's temperature as well.\nEDIT: I previously said \"overheating\" instead of \"excessive CPU usage.\" It's more accurate to say \"predicted overheating based on current CPU and fan speed,\" since the Mac temperature control system takes those into account as well.\n\nA: Here's something you can try:\n\n\n*\n\n*Reboot (you may have already done so)\n\n*Reinstall OS X from the Recovery HD\n\n*Delete caches by doing these commands in the Terminal rm -rf ~/Library/Caches\n\n*Delete all Safari caches (since it seems as if Safari may be the cause)\n\n\nEdit: it appears as if the answer by bmike is much more accurate.\n\nA: In my experience, kernel_task well-exceeding 100% cpu on my laptop can be resolved by reseting my power block. However, I live on a boat and have an occasionally inconsistent AC source. (Another symptom of this failure mode is the laptop indicates it's plugged in, but not charging.)\nIf the power supply finds unreliable AC, it stops charging the laptop. To solve this, unplug both ends of the power supply for a few seconds, then plug it back in. That (in my case) causes the laptop to start charging again, and kernel_task stops eating CPU and the fans stop spinning so much. \nBest to catch it before the laptop (seemingly quickly) runs its battery down. \n\nA: I just fixed the incredibly annoying kernel_task consumming 500% of my cpu's!\nThe problem has to do with hardware.\nIt doesn't get more bare metal than that, I opened the back cover, I have a mid 2015 Macbook Pro, I work remotely and I have a high dependency on Browser Based tools, so chrome is a CPU HOG, one part of the solution is to disable all those extensions that you do not use, that would ease a bit. \nHowever the bulk of my finding had to do with dirty fans, I would say, without being an expert (I've done Laptop maintenance for the past 25 years...), that these machines are precision instruments, at the size of the fans vs the power they need to cool, everything needs to be well, unclogged.\nI'm sure they have built in some room for it, but my reasoning tells me that there is somewhere in the OS some logic that accounts for the speed of the fans vs the airflow they provide. \nSo not enough airflow triggers the fans to work harder. After that it is all downhill, or should I say more uphill???.\nIn my experience that would be a second line of defence. \nClog the CPU to avoid a blast in Threads, keep it busy until it cools down, the computer as smart as it is, it cannot tell that there is clogged dirt preventing the airflow. What it did the trick for me are two things, the first one is PATIENCE, things are to say the least brittle, so take your time (took me 20 minutes for the whole process). And you do not want to end up with a short circuit cable because you pulled to hard, or missing bolts (not that anything like that has ever happened to me). Then the second part is a tool like this? I know you should have something like this at home, or you can get one online or in the pharmacy:\n\nIt is sturdy enough but gentle right on the spot to allow you to brush out all that dirt, then you can combine with a can of compressed air or just gently blow over it.\nWe as engineers tend to well over engineer. The fix was simple for me. I've done it in the past with 4 or 5 machines with same successful results. I am sharing my answer as it might shed some light over those inexplicable peaks.\nSo happy brushing,\nRegards\nEN\n\nA: I spend multiple days before finding out the solution that worked for me. Just try using a different charging cable. Your Macbook is plenty capable of working with multiple monitors, but frayed/internally damaged cables can cause strangely cause the kernel to enter into an infinite loop.\n\nA: In my case I had to turn off MacsFanControl in which I had both fans set to 2500 RPM. Once I turned the app off the fans started to spin faster, Mac cooled down and kernel_task stopped stealing CPU from other processes.\nIt's weird cause I though that MFC only sets minimum RPM and nothing prevents fans to spin faster. Maybe a bug? I used Catalina 10.15.3, upgraded to 10.15.6 and newest MacsFanControl but still the issue persisted.\nSo this issue can be related to thermal problems with your Mac:\n\n*\n\n*either you have something preventing fans to spin faster (like my case)\n\n*or you have clogged vents and your Mac is getting too hot\n\n\nA: I spent more than 5 hours dealing with this problem and nothing I found online worked. Activity Monitor showd kernel_task taking up 1400% of my CPU.\nIf it happens to you, try running $ kextstat | grep -v com.apple\nand then try to get rid of everything which pops up there.\nIn my case, the culprit was HAXM (com.intel.kext.intelhaxm). It’s supposed to provide better performance for android emulators (I installed it as soon as I got my macbook because Android Studio advised me to do so). However, after uninstalling it my emulators kept running ok, and I haven’t had this weird issue again.\n\nA: I tried to find a solution, but i could not find a final solution up to now.\nBut I stumbled across this video on YouTube and this man examined this issue and documented his results\nHis key findings were:\n\n*\n\n*use 60 Hz or better refresh rate on an external monitor\n\n*better: Use Display Port\n\n*Use Clam shell mode (close the lid)\n\n*Which ports you use for charging and the monitor does not really matter. There might be little effects on that.\n\n*Resolution of the monitor is not critical, even at 4K\n\nThe result when I changed the external monitor refresh rate to 60 Hz was that suddenly the IntelliJ Process was able to get far more CPU than before and that helped me a lot. The fans are still running at high speed and sometimes the kernel_task rises to 300% - but only for a short time and the MacBook does not freeze completely anymore.\n\nA: I have a MacBook 16\" 2019 and after 6 months it started getting too hot and kernel_task eating much CPU.\nAfter some tests I found out it was the external display\n(if it makes a difference, I'm using a regular HDMI monitor with a USB-C-HDMI adapter) - it worked for 6 months and now (even if I switch the HDMI adapter) it's overheating and hanging cpu.\nI tried many different solutions including removing power adapter, changing port sides, etc. None worked.\n", "Q: Noticebly larger amount of free space reported compared to the graph in Storage view My MacBook Pro is of 256 GB. Although I haven't used much of it's space, I'm kind of facing an issue. When I click the Apple menu on top left corner and go to About This Mac > Storage, it mentions 213 GB free of 256 GB but slightly below there is a bar, which is about half filled (approximately 160 GB acquired).\nThe most amazing part is 160 GB is being acquired by applications, and I haven't downloaded application more than 6 or 7.\nCan anyone tell me why the bar is filled but still it showing I'm left behind with 213 GB? I really appreciate if someone help me out with this.\n\n\nA: Sometimes spotlight can mess up that graph.\nI would open Finder and use the preferences to change the setting on calculate all folder sizes or use a tool like Daisy Disk to double check the sizes.\nIf you have that much space used but things are mis-classified, you can reset spotlight and leave the machine running for a few hours as it re-reads the storage contents.\nIf you don't have that much space used, boot to Recovery HD and run Disk Utility to repair the volume and drive.\n", "Q: Using iPhone screen as a display monitor Has anybody come across somebody using iPhone hardware (intact/as is, or hacked, taken apart, disassembled. either way) to use the iPhone screen as a display monitor?\n\nA: An app called Duet can make your iPhone a display for your Mac.\n\nA: SideCar for iPad\n\nWith Sidecar, you can use your iPad as a display that extends or mirrors your Mac desktop.\n\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210380\nDuet\n\nEx-Apple Engineers turn your iPad into an extra display.

I had no idea what to think except that the wire I had was faulty, so I exchanged it for one of the same brand. And then, bam, another week or so into use of the new wire the same thing happened. This time I decided to exchange it for another brand of Mini Displayport to Displayport cable. The same thing again! Clearly I was not taking the right approach to this problem.\nMy usual “setup/workflow” is that I have my monitor closed and use only the external display. At night, I turn off the monitor and unplug the power to my MBP (to not overcharge my battery) in no particular order. I wonder if my pulling the power, or some combinations of actions is killing the cable? Any thoughts?\n[This was my original thinking, but I have just gotten the cable working again—will offer a preliminary solution below.]\n\nA: I disabled the ddc/ci on my monitor and, while my HDMI cable was connected at the same time, swapped to DisplayPort and the cable started working again somewhat magically.\nI'm really not sure what happened, but I'm chalking it up to the ddc/ci thing.\n", "Q: MBP defaults to bootcamp If I reboot my machine and don't do anything it always starts up windows, which I find really annoying because I almost never load bootcamp and it requires me to babysit the reboot.

I want the size to always stay exactly the same as what I recorded on the iPhone 6 device into QuickTime NOT the size iMovie exports back to desktop. \nHow do I make iMovie keep the size of the original QuickTime iPhone 6 video?\n\nA: iMovie only generates video at specific resolutions. It's intended for simple use-cases, and so has a really cut-down feature set for video editing to make it harder for novice users to make mistakes. Unfortunately this means it often doesn't do what you want.\nIf you're only clipping the start/end of your video, you can just use Quicktime alone to achieve this. If you need to add titles or otherwise do some editing on your video, you can:\n\n\n*\n\n*use iMovie, export to the maximum resolution available, then down-sample to your desired resolution; or\n\n*use some video editing software that actually supports custom output resolutions (Final Cut Pro, Adobe Premiere, Lightworks, etc).\n\n", "Q: How to know from which number a missed call came, if the caller has multiple numbers?

This helped in knowing exactly what number he called me from and I could call back on the same number.\niOS 9.0.1 call log does not indicate the number the caller called from with blue (if the caller has more than one number).

Since upgrading to OS X El Capitan, I've noticed a change in the Terminal: Executed lines show an opening bracket on the left, and a closing bracket on the right, as shown in this screenshot:\n\nSimilar questions have been asked here:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://superuser.com/questions/974714/previous-commands-wrapped-with-square-brackets-in-os-x-terminal\n\n*https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32888295/why-is-a-being-added-to-my-prompt-after-upgrading-to-os-x-10-11\n\n*Changes to Terminal in El Capitan\n\n*Why is there a left bracket before my bash prompt?\n\n*New Terminal behavior after upgrading to OS X 10.11\nSome of the questions are referring to these brackets as marks, and the Terminal's Edit menu has a couple of entries related to marks, for example:\n\n\n*\n\n*Edit > Marks > Mark as Prompt and Send Return\n\n*Edit > Clear to Previous Mark\n\n*Edit > Navigate > Jump to Previous Mark\n\nIs there a summary of what these marks can be used for? I have not seen any reference to this new feature in any of the El Capitan feature overviews. \n\nA: Looks like a form of 'quick/light bookmarking'. I guess disabling 'Automatically mark prompt lines' makes its function more evident. After doing that, Cmd-Enter explicitly saves the mark, and Cmd-Up/Down jumps between them.\nAs you can convert marks to bookmarks and vice versa, I'd see them as lightweight or second-level bookmarks.\n\nA: Marks in the Terminal\nThe new Terminal marks (available starting with OS X 10.11 - El Capitan) are similar to Bookmarks, which are also available in the Terminal, allowing you to mark window positions and then giving you the option of going back at a later point.\nMarks (or Bookmarks) don't refer to your command history, but to the scroll buffer used in the Terminal window/tab.\nMarking a Line\nBy default, every time you press Enter in the Terminal window, the line is marked, which is displayed using an opening bracket at the beginning of the line and a closing one at the very end. This default behavior can be turned off using the Edit > Marks > Automatically Mark Prompt Lines menu entry. When this is disabled, you can still manually execute and mark a command using Cmd+Enter (or with the Edit > Marks > Mark as Prompt and Send Return menu entry).\nIf you have automatic marking enabled and want to run a command without marking it as a prompt, you can do this using Cmd+Shift+Enter (or with the Edit > Marks > Send Return Without Marking menu entry).\nDisabling Marks\nAutomatic marking of lines can be disabled using the Edit > Marks > Automatically Mark Prompt Lines menu entry.\nFrom the command line, the same can be achieved using\ndefaults write com.apple.Terminal AutoMarkPromptLines -bool NO\n\nHiding Marks\nIf you want to use the mark functionality, but don't want to see the brackets at the beginning and end of the line, you hide them using the View > Hide Marks menu entry. This will keep the below functionality intact, but will no longer show the brackets.\nJumping between Marks\nOnce a line has been marked, you can quickly jump to the previous mark using Cmd+Up or to the next one using Cmd+Down. Similar options are provided for Bookmarks, and for selecting to the next/previous mark:\n\nManually Marking a Line\nIn addition to the automatic marking, you can also manually add marks by selecting a line in the terminal output using the mouse, and then selecting the Edit > Marks > Mark as Prompt menu entry (or Cmd+U).\nUse Cases\nThe Marks functionality is useful if some of your executed commands produce lots of output, and you quickly want to scroll to the position where you entered the command. Pressing Cmd+Up will take you there. Pressing it repeatedly will take you further up, while pressing Cmd+Down will take you back down again. The target location is conveniently highlighted as you jump/scroll around.\n\nSelecting Content\nThe same marks functionality can be used for selecting Terminal output. Pressing Cmd+Shift+Up will select the content up to the previous mark, while Cmd+Shift+Down will select down to the next mark. This is useful when wanting to copy log output or other content from the Terminal.\nThis functionality is also available from the Edit > Navigate menu while pressing the Shift key:\n\nSummary\nHaving used this for a couple of days now, I find it incredibly useful. Scrolling up through hundreds of lines of output to find the beginning of the command's output has suddenly become a lot easier.\nI wonder why this new feature isn't mentioned more prominently - I haven't seen it in any of the El Capitan walkthroughs. The Terminal help currently does not provide any details on this feature either.\n", "Q: forgot appleid and password while downloading iOS 9, my iPhone 4s is not working while downloading iOS 9. I forgot Apple ID and password, I have serial no, ime no. and ICCID no of my phone, can Iu solve problem?\n\nA: First, open up iTunes you activated your iPhone before first usage. Within the account settings, you should see your AppleID name. If you have lost your password, then do a password recovery at iforgot.apple.com.\nSecond, if that doesn't help, you have to go to the next available AppleStore or contact Apple.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro in sleeping regime Will there be any damage to a MacBook Pro if I keep it in sleeping regime all the time?\nThe reason I don't switch it off is I had problems with the start button. It stopped working within a year and under guarantee they changed hardware but no one said to me how to exploit it properly or gave recommendations. (It turned out start button is linked to hardware and it's very weak and should not be pressed frequently but instead Macbook must be in sleeping mode to avoid pressing start button often).\nIn one year the same problem happened. As changing hardware is expensive they offered me to reformat it and all my applications were erased and it seems now it's running software for Macintosh.\nWhat can I do to prevent any troubles?\n\nA: I normally use the sleep mode 99% of the time.  The only time I ever shut down is when there is a software update that requires it.  Or once  a month or so, I see my machine getting \"confused\" and a restart seems to resolve the issue.  (I usually just restart and then continue, using sleep when done for the time being.)\n\nA: There's nothing I can see where sleeping damages hardware as long as you keep the battery charged at 50% for long term storage.\nIt's a lot of work and you'll be connecting and disconnecting the charger more than if you powered the hardware off, but that's the only damage you could accelerate by keeping the battery always 100% full.\nSoftware corruption and memory corruption might necessitate a reboot from time to time, but that's more about the software that you run than if you let the Mac sleep or not. Sleeping reduces software cycles, so you'll take longer to run into memory leaks or issues than if you just let the Mac run.\nI think you have a good plan and can stick with it.\n", "Q: How big is the apple on the back of your MacBook? Bit of an offbeat question, I know: but are the apple logos on the back of Mac laptops all the same size? Has the size varied over time, or does it vary over the models that are currently available? I don't have easy access to an Apple Store so I can't go in and measure the logos by hand.\nI'm trying to get some stickers made for an event, and as people seem to stick stickers on top laptops (and often over the Apple logo) I thought it would be a good idea to make the stickers slightly larger than the logo!\n\nA: On Macbook Pro 15 and Air 13, both mid-2012 : 47mm x 38mm\n", "Q: Terminal problem: dhcp mode Everytime I start terminal, it says dhcp instead of my account name. Why is this and how do I exit out of it?\ndhcp-205122:~ NAME$ \n\n\nA: In some more sophisticated networks, the prompt may be overwritten by the network providing you with the name given by the DHCP server there. This may be particularly obvious, if instead of your account the computer's hostname is displayed.\nHow to change it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Terminal\n\n*Type in sudo nano /etc/profile (you need to be part of the administrators group to submit this command)\n\n*Look for a line starting with PS1=; if there is no such line, you can add it at the end (see example below)\n\n*To include the user, add \\u to the line\n\n\nTo give you an example of a working line, my personal favorite is: PS1=\"\\u@\\h:\\w \\$ \"\nHere is what it does:\n\\u adds the user name\n\\h adds the hostname\n\\w adds the full current working directory\n\\$ adds a $ sign for all regular users and a # while logged in as root.\nAll other characters in the mix are representing themselves. So, such a prompt would convert to something like the following:\nblackmouse@bm-computer:/Library/Application Support $\nUser and computer name are fictive as I, for obvious reasons, do not know your real computer user or computer name and the path will change to whatever directory you are in.\n", "Q: iOS Album-Art Mismatch Post Sync Whenever I sync any song to my iPhone, some of the songs / albums display the wrong album art despite having the correct album-art in iTunes. I have had this issue since iOS 8 and all of my devices are up to date on the software side. Check out the examples below:\n\n\nFor example, Ride of the Valkyries shows album-art of ‘A Sky Full of Stars’ when I first synced to the device. After I deleted it from my iPhone and synced the song again, it showed album-art from ‘Songs from The Martian’. For the record, these albums are present in my iTunes library and they display it correctly.\nBe advised, this problem only with the album-art, not the song meta-data.\nHardware Info: iTunes 12.3 on Windows with iPhone 5 on iOS 9.0.2\n\nA: After digging a lot of sites on the web, also including StackExchange, I finally stumbled on this blog by Kirk McElhearn. However, it only pointed me the right direction. After trying different methods, the correct solution was not to disconnect my iPhone from the internet while I synced, but to disconnect my PC from the internet before I started the sync process. Here is the result:\n\nAnd voila!\nIt finally showed the correct album-art. However my problem was fixed only for that particular song. I had to delete all the songs that had mismatched album-art and re-sync those songs again. It was a pain-in-the-a**, but the result was worth it (if you are particularly OCD about keeping your music perfect).\n", "Q: Mail aliases El Capitan I used several aliases on my gmail account that was configured in mail.app.\nAfter upgrading to El Capitan, those aliases just vanished.\nThere is an option in Preferences>Accounts>Account Information>Alias \"Edit Alias\".

The usual method to run python from Xcode is given here https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5276967/python-in-xcode-7/8636301#8636301.\nBut with the new release of El Capitan (OS X 10.11), the /usr/local/bin/ directory is locked and in the step in \"Edit Scheme > Info > Executable\" where the executable has to be selected from a pop-up window, since the SIP is enforced, this is not possible. I already own the /usr/local/ but this hasn't helped. It is worthwhile to note that this problem should not be python version specific.\nCan somebody suggest a workaround for this? \nI know I will receive suggestions for using other editors and engines such as Eclipse and Canopy, but no thank you (no offence to Eclipse or Enthought of course).\n\nA: trying run Python 2.7.11 on Xcode 7.2 on OS X 10.11.2;\nI could not select 'python' under \"Edit Scheme\" > \"Info\" > \"Executable\" \nIt was grayed out. I do not know what SIP means, but I got it to work by right-clicking the grayed out 'python' under usr/local/bin in the window and selecting \"Quick Look\"\nA box opened and I closed it and 'python' was now selectable and ran the file like a champ! \n\nA: My system is OS X 10.11 El Capitan with SIP enabled, with Xcode 7.2.1, and the following solution work for me.\nThe solution briefly: for your executable, select the Python installed in your system, which resides in:\nPython.framework/Versions/ (3.x or 2.7) /Python\n\nThe location of Python.framework depends on which distribution of Python you're using. Most often it can be found in /Library/Frameworks.\nMore comprehensive directions below.\n\nEdit your Xcode scheme:\n\n\n*\n\n*Select Product > Scheme > Edit Scheme\n\n*Run > Info > Executable > Other\n\n*Press Cmd(⌘)+Shift+G and type in the place where your Python executables are installed.\n\n*Select \"Python\" executable file.\n\n\nNow, the place where the actual executables varies, depending on which Python distribution you chose to install. None of those, to my knowledge, place anything but symlinks to /usr/local/bin or /opt/local/bin. Below, I'll provide directions to finding your Python executable file.\n\nMacPython\nThis is the version from the official Python website, and it resides in /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework.\nActiveState ActivePython\nInstalls to the same directory as MacPython.\nMacPorts\nMacPorts installs its python to /opt/local/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework.\nHomeBrew\nHomeBrew has two possible locations for your Python.framework, because unlike any other distribution, HomeBrew installs them separately.\n\n\n*\n\n*python2 in /usr/local/Cellar/python\n\n*python3 in /usr/local/Cellar/python3\nInside either of them, you'll find Frameworks/Python.framework.\n\nAll distributions\nInside any Python.framework, you'll want to open a folder named Versions. Inside, you'll find folders corresponding to Python versions installed on your system. Open whichever one you want to use, and inside You'll find an executable named Python. You're done!\n\nA: I know this was posted a loooong time ago, but i ran into the same issue just now, and thought i would share my findings.\nThis solution worked for me.\n\n\n*\n\n*Close Xcode.\n\n*Browse to you project library.\n\n*Right click the project .xcodeproj file and choose 'Show Package Contents' \n\n*Find the project .xcscheme file and open it in a editor.\n\n*Find the PathRunnable tag, and set the FilePath to \"/usr/local/bin/python3\"\n\n*Save the file and open the project again.\n\n\nThis way you can use brew install python3 to install your preferred Python for Xcode. \n\nA: When you click on \"Other...\" and the dialog window comes up, press shift+cmd+g. That will open a dialog box that lets you type a specific path.

Look in \n/Library/SystemMigration/History/Migration-something-about-your-computer/QuarantineRoot\nand see if there is anything about the mouse.  This is likely, especially if the mouse required a kernel extension to actually function.

I'm transitioning to using Photos.app on both iOS and OS X - with the intention to use iCloud Photo Library...\nBefore making this change I had to move a bunch of photos off an iPhone to free up space. I did so using Image Capture on the Mac - and I've ended up with .JPGs paired with .AAEs (the latter, as I understand it, containing the image edits).\n(So, I moved the photos off the iPhone to a folder on a Mac, duplicated on external disk, did a back up, then deleted the images on the iPhone)\nI've read this Q&A with tells of a method to use a python script to apply of the filters to the corresponding images.\nWhat I'd like to know: is it possible to import both the .JPG files and .AAE files so that the original image is still available in Photos? E.g. so that the revert option would still be available...\n\nA: best way to do this is via AirDrop, its super fast and doesn't require a internet connection (bluetooth and WIFI need to be switched on though).

I have a recent iPod touch (just over 1 year old). \nI have an audio file from a voice recorder I'd like to load to it. The audio is 2-1/2 hours, a voice recording, but when copied to iTunes, it shows as a song. And when the iPod is attached, via cable to the computer, there's no option to just choose individual songs. The file is too long to load to cloud. Similarly produced files were only 1-1/2 hours max, and went thru cloud just fine. \nAny suggestion how to move the file to iPod? \nEdit - Update - As I noted in the comment below, the 1:20 file transferred just fine. Today, I tried a file that was 1:30 (90 minutes) and it won't show as available to transfer. The simple ongoing solution, is to just break into multiple files, 80 minutes maximum. Which coincidently, lets me burn to CD if I wish. \n\nA: In iTunes, click on your device. Scroll down a little and click Manually Manage Songs. Then go to music (on the side) and add your song.\nIf you have the iTunes sidebar enabled, you should be able to drag your song on top of your iPod, and it should sync.\n", "Q: Increase Activity monitor update frequency to less than a second I want to use the \"CPU history\" to monitor how some program uses the CPU, but the update frequency of \"very often (1 sec)\" is not fast enough for me.

If I just replace a TV with Macbook Pro, does it work? I haven't tested it yet. Please give me some suggestions. Thanks.\n\nA: Amazon Fire TV requires a TV with an HDMI input channel to display video, something MacBooks (or pretty much any computer) are lacking. So no, this will not work (it won't work with an Apple TV/MacBook combination either).\n\nA: You must have an INPUT port on your Mac in order for this to work.  Unfortunately they only come with OUTPUT ports...sorry....no FireStick to Mac capability!\n\nA: Yes, as long as you have an HDMI port in your Mac. If you don't, you can buy a DisplayPort to HDMI adapter.\n", "Q: How long do I have to tap \"Don't send\" when sending a text message from Apple Watch? When I send a message using siri on apple watch, the text of the message is shown and the only option available is \"Don't send\". The message is sent if no action is taken - how long until the message is sent?\n\nA: There isn't a fixed amount of time to send on Watch OS 2.0. It really depends on what you do next with the watch.\nIf you don't go on to other tasks, it appears to exist in a state where the \"don't send\" is active for over 2 minutes - well past the point where the watch screen goes dim.\nI believe it's about 20 seconds once you leave the watch alone to when the message posts, but I don't get feedback and the time stamps on other devices round to the nearest minute, so getting a precise measure eluded me when testing this morning.\nI just place my hand over the entire screen to blank it when I want the send to be final and leave the watch alone for a bit.\n", "Q: Merging two email accounts in El Capitan After the upgrade, El Capitan duplicated my Gmail account, which is now both as POP and IMAP (that is because I set up my Google Internet account in Yosemite, but I never set up the IMAP account in Mail.  El Capitan did it without asking...).  Because POP is a terrible protocol, some of the emails that were received or sent in the POP version of the account have not made it to the GMail server, and thus are just local to my computer.  What I want is to\n\n\n*\n\n*move all the emails in the POP 'Inbox' to the IMAP 'Inbox'\n\n*move all the emails in the POP 'Sent' to the IMAP 'Sent'\n\n\nwithout duplication (If I drag stuff around I would duplicate thousands of emails).  Is there a smart way of doing this?  Also pretty important is that my flagged emails are kept (some, annoyingly, are still stuck in the POP account).\n\nA: Well I did nothing aside from waiting and 'synchronising' the account regularly, and thanks to the magic of IMAP the messages that had been in the POP account reappeared (I had chosen the option to save all the incoming and outgoing mail on the server).\n", "Q: External Display and Blurry Fonts on El Capitan I am one of the many who have extremely blurry fonts on external displays connected to my 2014 MacBook Pro. The solution for me has always been to follow this guide which runs a ruby script and puts the result in an overrides folder.\nEDIT: By turning off the new \"rootless\" feature of El Capitan I was able to gain access to the overrides folder, however it does not appear to have worked. Anyone had any luck fixing the blurry fonts on external displays for El Capitan?\n\nA: The location of the Overrides directory changed to /System/Library/Displays/Contents/Resources/Overrides/. Note that you will need to disable System Integrity Protection to add files there.\n\nA: It is a good idea to check whether the monitor in question is already using RGB before the above is attempted as it may not achieve any benefit. To check: Utilities/System Information->Displays and look to see if it is using RGB (You can also check in System Preferences->Displays-> Color->Open Profile->Header->Space) if so then your problem lies elsewhere.\nAnother possible solution is to try altering Font smoothing options in System Preferences->General'. Or if you're seeing problems in a particular app - e.g. In Preview go to Preferences->PDF and untick 'Smooth text and line art'.\n\nA: To my experience it was caused by the HDMI connection. I replaced it with a DisplayPort adapter and the problem is solved.\nThe display auto settings must be different when it detects HDMI and can't find the right parameters for some reason. \n", "Q: What are alternatives to EyeTV for watching live TV I have an old Pinnacle PCTV HD Pro Stick (800e) that I would like to use to record and watch TV using an over-the-air antenna. I know that some people love EyeTV, but it's a bit expensive and not very configurable as far as I can tell.\nThe ideal software would have some or all of the below features:\n\n\n*\n\n*Inexpensive (price of software and price of program guide (EPG) subscription)\n\n*Configurable recordings (\"record every new episode of this show\")\n\n*Automated commercial removal from recordings\n\n*Automated and configurable export of recordings (location, video format, file name based on program data)\n\n*Live TV or recordings streamed to other devices (Roku, iOS, web browser)\n\n\nI'm in the US and am looking to watch OTA HD TV stations (ATSC).\nDoes this unicorn exist?\n\nA: No this unicorn doesn't exist.  I was looking to revamp my MacMini/EyeTv setup earlier this year and looked around quite a bit at alternatives. What I found was that cable and dish DVR's have pretty much destroyed the computer hobby market for TV along with DRM licensing costs.\nI think the closest you're going to get are the boxes from SiliconDust or Hauppage. Both have DVR and sharing abilities, but their software is a bit more high maintenance than EyeTV's to achieve most of your programming goals.\nI finally decided to stick with EyeTV for my DVR and live viewing. Fingers crossed that they will keep the software updated. I use the TitanTV program guide to manually schedule recordings. EyeTV still does an excellent job of exporting programs for archiving. Good luck finding auto commercial removal, the last company to try that, Replay, was sued out of existence.\n", "Q: Can't update from El Capitan public beta I took part in the public beta of El Capitan but now that the official version has been released I can't get it to update. If I go to Updates in the App Store I get \"No Updates Available\" and if I try installing from the OS's page, I get the option to download the installer instead.\nI'm guessing that A) there are differences between the last public beta and the release so there should be an update, and B) since I can't find any other mention of this issue, something is messed up on my machine preventing it from seeing the update.\nShould I bite the bullet and download and run the installer or is there something I can change to get my machine to update?\n\n\nA: Go to the Purchased page and click UPDATE there.\n\nA: What ended up working was searching for \"El Capitan\" in the Mac App Store, clicking \"Download\", clicking \"Continue\", and running the downloaded installer.  Now that 10.11.2 is out, I'm getting the expected items in the Update tab so things appear be back to normal.\n\n", "Q: I accidentally removed way too many files with `rm -rf`. Anyway to recover? While trying to move a git repository, I ran rm -rf desktop and wiped every file I had there.  Normally this would not be that big of a deal since I use GitHub, but I had several hundred screenshots / PDFs that I would like to recover.\nWhat's the best way to go about this (if there is any)? From what I've read I it seems I need to download some external software, but can't seem to figure out which is best.\nI am running OS X 10.10.4 on a MacBook Pro, and unfortunately never set up Time Machine.\n\nA: What you do need to do is stop using that drive until you have sourced your recovery software of choice. Every file you write increases the chances of total loss.\nYou need something that can scavenge the actual data still on the drive itself & hopefully recognise enough contiguous data that it can recover the files - hence anything that writes to the drive, including even booting from it, will lessen the chances of success.\nYou cannot, of course, use the same drive to recover to - you would be overwriting what you are trying to rescue. \nSomething like maybe Data Rescue or Disk Drill specialise in this type of recovery . The trouble with having done rm -rf is your files never even went through the trash, they went straight to data heaven, so a scavenger is your only hope, I think.\n", "Q: Problem with iMessage \"Delivered\" status For some recipients when I send an iMessage (blue blox) I get a \"Delivered\" message below it.  However, with other users the \"Delivered\" box never appears.  I know one option is that their phone may be off, but I know this is not the case because I get a response. Why does the \"Delivered\" status appear on some iMessages, but not on others when I know the message has been received?  Thank you for your help. \n\nA: Basically, your message has been sent, from your end, to another iPhone or Apple apparatus (it appears in Blue and not Green) but has not been delivered to your recipient. \n\"Delivered\" may not appear for several reasons. The most likely, and also the only I've confirmed, is that the recipient cannot receive the data. This happens when a phone is off or out of service range, obviously. It also happens frequently if they are talking on the phone. When someone is talking voice, and out of a WiFi area, they may not be able to receive text messages, because they may drop or lose some of the data, so it is conveniently held onto for them until they're freed up (i.e. off the phone). It can also happen when WiFi access is spotty, when other apps are running in the background, etc. \nThe reason you may be experiencing this but still receiving responses is that once a response is sent (in any exchange) that \"Delivered\" or \"Read\" message vanishes. Poof. So you're probably just not seeing it change to Delivered to Read before you see a response. \nAnother possibility that makes sense and could explain both, however unconfirmed by yours truly, is that the \"Do Not Disturb\" feature is toggled on the recipients phone. As far as I was aware, this simply prevents them from receiving notifications of the messages, but I haven't test it out.  \nIt's one of the above anyway for sure.  Hope it helps. \n", "Q: Are there any keyboard shortcuts for using El Capitan Split View for Mac? This question is about Mac El Capitan SplitView\nI am a fan of using splitscreen views as in i3 for linux.\nOr when I am on Windows I use snapping\nWith the new feature is there a way to use it without touching the mouse?\nSo far I've only seen that you can use it by setting it to fullscreen-mode and then use Mission Control for it. new-split-screen\n\nA: I have found that Spectacle is the way to go!\nspectacle\n\nA: It's unfortunate that there aren't keyboard shortcuts for native split screen mode.\nHowever, I use a cheaper program called BetterSnapTool (as of 07/27/2016 is $2.99 USD in the App Store) and it does have keyboard shortcuts. \n\nA: It can be done with Spectacle. It's free and serve my need. You can split screen in any direction. You can also configure its shortcuts to do whatever you want.\n\nA: No shortcuts for Split Screen in El Capitan as far as I am aware.\nHowever ShiftIt (completely free!) is amazing for this! Like just unbelievably brilliant.\nBeen using it since Mountain Lion.\nhttps://github.com/fikovnik/ShiftIt/releases\nCan also be installed via HomeBrew:\n$ brew cask install ShiftIt\n\nFYI I am in no way associated with this software's development.\n\nA: There are no keyboard shortcuts to activate this feature of OS X currently. The primary way to activate it is to click and hold down the Green traffic light and select another available window to use in split screen.\n\nA: It can be done easily with Keyboard Maestro ($36).\nCreate two macros, with whatever keyboard shortcuts you like, one for focussing the lefthand pane, and another to focus the right one.\nUse the Move and Click action to Click the Left Button relative to the Absolute Postion.\nYou need to set the x, y coordinates according to the size of your display. The height isn't too important (I just used the halfway point), but you'll want KM to click near to the sides of the display, so the clicks will always be in the correct pane, even if you resize them.\n\nObviously, $36 is a lot to fix one thing, but KM can do a lot of useful stuff, so you will probably find it's worth it, especially if you like doing everything with shortcuts.\n", "Q: Setting font weight in Terminal.app for El Capitan I've noticed that there's a subtle difference in the way fonts are rendered in the Terminal app in El Capitan (vs Yosemite). It seems like it used to be the case that the AppleFontSmoothing property in the plist could be adjusted which would affect how heavy or light the font would be rendered. This no longer seems to be the case. Is there another way to do this? I'd like to use my fonts but have them rendered more heavily. \nRelated question: Is there a way to make the terminal's font less blurry?\n\nA: Starting in OS X El Capitan 10.11, Terminal's font smoothing is reduced for light-on-dark text, so that the overall weight is closer to the weight of dark-on-light text, improving readability by opening up counters (the open spaces inside glyphs like “e”), for example.\nYou should find that it matches Safari's text rendering for light-on-dark text. It addresses the issue referred to in the question you linked:  Is there a way to make the terminal's font less blurry?\nThis new behavior is automatic and doesn't read the AppleFontSmoothing preference.\nIf this is important to you, I recommend filing a bug report asking for either Terminal's new behavior to honor the AppleFontSmoothing preference or to add a Terminal-specific preference to control font smoothing.\nUpdate: As of macOS Sierra 10.12, this behavior has been tuned to not reduce the font smoothing as much for light-on-dark text, matching Safari/WebKit more closely, and it does not apply at all to Retina displays. In addition, it once again honors the AppleFontSmoothing preference, making the smoothing lighter relative to the AppleFontSmoothing value. The end result is that the weight of light-on-dark text should look as close as possible to the weight of dark-on-light text with the same AppleFontSmoothing value.\n\nA: You can change the font, however, it appears to be a font smoothing issue. I just upgraded from Yosemite 30 minutes ago and notice a HUGE difference with the terminal font I've chosen (Menlo) and how it looks now.\nIt's not as simple as just tweaking the sizing and weight as it's now being rendered differently on a system level. There may be a way to change smoothing back to how it was prior to the upgrade for the Terminal, which is the only issue \n\nA: It's seems that you can change the terminal font :\nhttp://osxdaily.com/2011/09/02/use-any-font-in-the-mac-os-x-lion-terminal/\nSo, perhaps you can choose an higher font ;)\n", "Q: Why is 1280x800 the best resolution for my MacBook Pro Retina 13\"? When I go to display settings on my rMBP 13\", it says that the \"best for retina\" resolution is 1280x800. \nBut when I go to display settings on a 13\" MacBook Air it says that the native resolution is 1440x900. \nWhy would Apple put different display panels on two computers that are the same screen size?\n\nA: The explanation on the Preferences panel is wrong and confusing. The Retina display doesn't actually run at 1280x800. Instead it just \"looks like\" it does.\nA 13.3 inch screen running at 96dpi (pixels(dots) per inch) has a resolution of about 1280x800 and the 8pt font and other on screen elements are big enough for the eye to see. When you run a 13.3 at retina resolutions 2560x1800 the fonts are much much smaller and hard to look at, so OS X makes them as big as they were at 1280x800 but more detailed. You get to see the same thing as one would at 1280x800 but at much greater detail 226dpi instead of 96dpi.\nResolution is just a big \"carpet\" of dots, you have a fixed amount of them and you can make the dots bigger to cover more area. For example a 3840x2160 4K TV that is 48 inches wide diagonally has about 90 pixels per inch comparable to a normal desktop monitor. A 15 inch Retina Macbook Pro has 2800x1800 (a little less than the 4k tv) but they are packed smaller and closer together on a much smaller surface area, 15 inch wide instead of 48.\n\nA: The newer MBP is a retina display macbook. The pixel density on 1280x800 is 4 times higher than traditionally, which makes for a very sharp and clear image.\nI also rather prefer setting the monitor to a higher resolution, makes working so much easier - but to show off, 1280x800 really looks best.\n\nA: They put 1440x900 as the default resolution on 2016 MacBook Pros since GPU got better.\nSource: https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/5dopnu/why_does_the_2016_macbook_pro_have_a_different/\n\nA: 13\" rMBP screens has 2560 x 1600 native screen resolotion which by default is set to scaled to improve picture quality so OSX is running at 1280 x 800 with double scaling\n13\" MBA screens are native 1440 x 900 (not retina to apple) and it is running at native screen resolution\n", "Q: Receiving iMessages from a deleted contact I've recently deleted contact details of a friend. Will this stop them from sending me an iMessage on my Mac? My iMessage is set up with my email address, not a phone number.\n\nA: In short, no. If you want someone to stop sending you iMessages, you have to explicitly block them.\nTo block someone, open the Messages app, Go to Preferences, Accounts, and click on the Blocked tab. Hit the plus sign to add someone to the list.\nThis only blocks iMessages and won't block normal text messages (if you have an iPhone and it's set up to do handoff to your Mac).\n", "Q: How can I tell whom a text message is addressed to? I have my iPhone 5S set up so I may receive text messages sent to my email account, my phone number AND my son's phone number. The problem is, when I get a message (say, one that was sent to my son's number) I can't tell if it was sent to ME or HIM. \nHow can I see this info?\n\nA: I'd guess you probably can't. \nThe entire Apple/iCloud paradigm is to be able to get messages to you across multiple devices simultaneously.\nTo make it easy for you to deal with those messages wherever you may be. \nThe last thought of the manufacturers/programmers was to differentiate message recipients inside one device containing multiple yous.\n", "Q: Is there a gesture to dismiss a notification It happens with unusual frequency that a notification will pop up covering the top right area of my window, right when I need to get a something in that top right area.  I'd rather not have to wait the 5 seconds for the notification to go away. Is there a way to dismiss the notification right away?\nI had read here that a right swipe on the magic mouse would do the trick, but that doesn't seem to be the case, at least for me.\n\nA: in el Capitan, the swipe away feature was disabled for Reminder alerts. Now you have to click Later.. then click 1 hour, 1 day, etc.. So they changed a simple swipe away gesture with 2 clicks.. per notification. It makes it way more complicated, I don't know what Apple was thinking when they changed this, at least they should give the option of making it simpler. \n\nA: With a trackpad or mouse, you can click the notification and drag it right towards the edge of the screen. If you do it fast enough it's almost like a swipe.\nOn a trackpad you can also just swipe right with two fingers.\n\nA: If you go to settings, I think you can change the setting from alerts, to banners, which can be swiped away, unfortunately now they disappear after  few seconds, but they will still be in notifications centre by swiping in with two fingers from the right of the track pad.\nNB I am running OS sierra. \n\nA: In my case the problem was hidden in settings. Swipe to scroll between pages have been seated up for 3 finger gestures and dismissing a notification did not work. After setting back to \"two fingers swipe\" it is working again. Looks like apple bug for me, but solved - at least for me.\n", "Q: Mail App timing out and having trouble getting and sending mail I'm using El Capitan now...but this problem existed with Yosemite too. \nI keep getting error messages that say either could not connect to server or the server returned the error: Connections to the server “imap-mail.outlook.com” on the default ports timed out...sometimes it's saying that my trash cannot be emptied, other times it says a piece of mail could not be moved to trash.\nIf I open connection doctor on my original account, it shows two types of connections for each (gmail and hotmail) of my webmail accounts (SMTP and IMAP); for this, I have no idea why! I set up each of these accounts though the mail app, so I did not add them manually that their should be two types of account for each, as I did not choose the type - they are predetermined by the app. \nI spoke with Apple about this and a few other issues a couple weeks ago, and the tech suggested that when I had Apple transfer some files onto this new Macbook from a Windows 8 computer, that something potentially got transferred that was a WIN8 file, that ends up corrupting mail. Didn't make much sense to me sense these are webmail accounts and not discrete files, but what do I know.\nHe told me to open a new user on the Macbook (as guest user deletes upon shutdown), then open up the mail accounts the same way through the Mail app, and that should fix it. I've now done that, and still...same problem except now, it's not showing two types of webmail for each account, just IMAP. But it currently won't sent the mail I just drafted and i just got the server timed out message.\nSince they are webmail accounts, I could just access them online, but I want the organizational features of having them in one place, merging calendars, etc.  \nAny help, even an affirmation that this is a bug that others are experiencing, would be much appreciated. I really thought this was an OS X problem and hoped it would be fixed with the release of El Capitan, but no love.\n\nA: Debugging mail has become a bit cumbersome since the program is now designed to do all of the network requests on background threads and the main UI never blocks. Worse, I don't think there's any way to see important statistics like: What percentage of network requests time out or error? What is the response time for my mail server over time.\nWith that being said, here are the things I do to isolate and debug mail.\n\n\n*\n\n*Ensure my Mac has accurate time by enabling Set date and time automatically and manually making the time wrong in the past by 1 minute or more and then enabling the check to ensure my clock will be close to the clocks on the Mail servers.\n\n*Make a new user account and only enter one Mail account in that user. This lets me log out of my main user and really focus on one mail server (actually two - one for receiving and another for sending) and makes the debug logs much easier to parse.\n\n*In the new account, I don't sign in to iCloud, and when I'm setting up the Mail account, I disable the check mark for Mail and only select Notes - I just want to test the log in and log out first without downloading all the mail initially.\n\n*Open up Connection Doctor (under the Window menu or use help to find it)\n\n*Enable Log Connection Activity\n\n*Press Show Logs\n\n\nYou will now have more data than you might like, but watch for the green light status of the Internet Connection and the status / errors of IMAP/SMTP and other items in the doctor window.\nIf I don't have a problem and all the lights are green, I quit make and use Finder to navigate up one folder from the logs and compress the entire Mail folder. That gives me a baseline of when things worked.\nAt that point, if there is an error, you can dig into the logs or post here. You could engage AppleCare or your mail provider for help - and now you have logs. Asking a follow on question with some error message from the logs might also be worth while here. (Or even ask what the various logs mean).\nIf there isn't an error on the new account, log out of the test Account on your Mac and log back in to your main account and repeat the connection doctor steps. Enable logs there if you find a problem.\n\nTL; DR - your mail issues are the same as my Mail issues and I'm not using exchange, but I do use an IMAP mail server in France which is across the atlantic from where I typically work. My suspicion is that the network errors and time outs are happening and I don't get good feedback when these errors happen and instead Mail hides all the evidence, diligently re-trying a slow connection and in the end making me unhappy. I'm looking to see if I can gather mail statistics so that I can monitor health of my mail connections in aggregate and then choose a faster mail server based on evidence, but so far, I'm only able to find out when the servers are down as opposed to being too slow to effectively work, but up enough to answer Mail's patient requests within 2 minutes so I don't actually get a \"failure to connect\".\n\nA: I struggled with timeouts in Mail for years, through at least 3 or more version of the OS, and just recently found the answer for me:\nReset PRAM.\nhttp://www.macworld.com/article/2881177/how-to-reset-your-macs-nvram-pram-and-smc.html\nI discovered it via https://discussions.apple.com/message/26974748#26974748\n3 days on, not one timeout.\nMail's Connection Doctor shows me connections to both IMAP and SMTP (used by iCloud and FastMail) to be consistently reliable and quick (typical 2-6s).\nFinally.\n", "Q: Multiple devices getting same text messages I am part of a company where a lot of people use iPhones/iPads.  I don't personally and never have, so I'm at a loss here and am hoping someone here can tell me.  \nWe have a company iTunes account set up, it makes it easier when setting up iPhones and iPads to have one account set up so we don't have to buy apps multiple times and I don't have to make up an iTunes account for every single employee and remember all the information for each one.  2 people in my company I know have the same iTunes accounts on their phones, and they're both getting messages meant for the other one.  Is this because of the iTunes account being the same?  Is the iTunes account somehow tied to the text messaging capability of iPhones?\n\nA: From my understanding, they will probably be getting the same iMessages due to the same iTunes account being used and being the default for iCloud.\nWhat you could do is go to Settings > iCloud and change or create a personal iCloud account for the person.  In Settings > App and iTunes Stores, the original email you used for apps should stay there.\nOr just turn off iMessage so the phones default to SMS. This can be done in Settings > Messages.\n", "Q: MacBook retina 12 inch 2015: text garbled on URL bar of safari What can cause this?\nThe URL bar is behaving weirdly and cannot be edited\n\n\nA: I have had the same issue  happen to me, once (I also have the same laptop)....I just rebooted and it never happened again. \nI'm unsure if it's even a machine/OS X issue or a scripting error.\nHopefully that solves your same problem.\n", "Q: How do I remove \"nearby cocktail bars\" on iOS 9? A friend of mine in AA (Alcoholics Anonymous) asked me if I knew of a way to remove \"nearby bars\" from his iPhone. This appears when you swipe left and the built in Maps feature displays this. \n\n\nA: You can open settings -> general -> Spotlight Search, then turn off maps. This is a workaround, but it will not give you gas stations or anything of that type either.\n", "Q: Can't access old iTunes purchases after changing email address I made my account around 2006, and have changed my email address a couple of times. Now I can't download past purchases or even listen to the songs I purchased without my iPad prompting me to enter my old address and password for those songs.\nWhen I went onto the Apple website and put \"forgot password\" for my \"old accounts\", of course it told me that those accounts did not exist. Of course they didn't, because they were never separate accounts like Apple claims.\nWhat can I do about this?\n\nA: This sounds like something is broken on the iTunes side - you can indeed change your email address and it's all still tied to the same Apple \"account\", meaning all your old purchases should still be there.\nThe very first thing you should do is contact iTunes support and explain what happened. Chances are high they'll be able to correct whatever's happened.\n", "Q: Parallels Desktop 9 - Failed to open the Parallels networking module.

The computer used to be my mother's and I have just noticed that she has never applied any of the firmware updates released by Apple (It is 3 versions behind). \nThis has created some performance issues (specially with the newly installed SSD), and I would like to apply the upgrades. But the firmware installer refuses to run on El Capitan, saying it is incompatible with this version of the OS. \nIs there any solution for this problem? Can I, in any way, install the EFI updates without formatting the disk and downgrading the OS? -- Let's say by creating a live OS boot disk, etc...\n\nA: Simple answer is you can check for the most recent here and it looks like yours would be available here. You can even get this info from the ol' stalwart Mactracker.\nWithout the exact model identifier I'm just guessing, but assuming you have even the later version from that year (MacMini4,1), the most recent publicly available EFI updates Apple released (at least as of 10.10.4) do not include that hardware. I haven't re-verified it as of either 10.10.5 or ElCapGM, but you can rip apart their publicly posted EFI package and see the javascript-based installer logic for choosing what models the package can patch. I published a post about the topic, and although I haven't gotten confirmation from an authoritative source like Apple themselves, one could assume the most recent-looking model being MM51.88Z.0077.B12.1506081728 means you're out of luck with patches that fix the 'thunderstrike' vulnerabilities.  \nAnd regarding ElCap in particular, since it should have the same hardware support as Mavericks or Mountain Lion, you should be able to confirm it's ready to be upgraded with this command: ioreg -l -p IODeviceTree | grep -E 'firmware-abi.*EFI64'\n\nA: I have the same problem with replaced board on Mac Mini 2011\nIt have missing serial number and two versions old firmware that I can't upgrade because it say it only support 10.9\nCan't find any solution except reinstall so far\n", "Q: My iPad isn't charging My Apple iPad went dead over night and in the morning I plugged it in. It shows a little battery icon with three red bars so I plugged it in and I thought it would charge for about 4 hours I came back to see how it was. The same thing was on the screen and when I unplugged it from the charger, it flashed that the battery is low and I need to plug it in. So I plugged it back in and ever since it still has that bar with the three bars and will not charge or do anything. I've already held down the home and the other button for 15 seconds, and still it has not started to work and I do not know what to do!\n\nA: Make sure you are using an official Apple charger.  Sometimes the cheap chargers are hit-or-miss.  I have a generic lightning cable for an iPhone that I bought at a gas station, and sometimes it works, and sometimes it doesn't.\nSometimes it will notice that it's plugged in, but will not actually charge.  As for my knock-off lightning cable, sometimes it depends on which direction I have it inserted (since they fit both ways).\nJust play around with it and come back every once in awhile.  If all else fails, take it to a Genius Bar.\n", "Q: Why does only one episode show up under \"unplayed\" in Podcasts when I haven't heard any of them? I have this issue on my iPhone, iPad, and the iTunes app on my computer, which leads me to believe that it's not just some bug in the app. This happens for all the podcasts I have. The weird thing is that it actually knows which episodes are played, and indicates this with a little gray circle next to each unplayed episode, but for some reason the \"unplayed\" menu only shows one episode.\n\nA: What I ended up doing was pressing \"Edit\" at the top left of the screen, then selecting all the episodes I haven't listened to yet (yeah it takes a minute), then pressing \"Mark\", then \"Mark as unplayed\".

(All DHCP and NAT takes place on the router, not the Time Capsule.)\nDuring debugging of home networking issues, I created a new wireless network on the router (it has its own antennae, etc.) and I used the Airport Utility to turn the Wireless off on my Time Capsule.\nI'm now connected to the network via the router, and want to return to the previous setup. However, the Airport Utility can no longer connect to the Time Capsule. It's like it cannot find it on the network.\nHow can I turn Wi-Fi back on?\n\nA: You can also use Ethernet to connect to a Time Capsule with Wi-Fi disabled.\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect Time Capsule and Mac via Ethernet cable.\n\n*Launch Airport Utility.

Clicking on it now allows to change its 'Network Mode' by first hitting 'Edit', then choosing the 'Wireless' tab, followed by selecting Wi-Fi from the dropdown menu. Applying the settings will take a few seconds and require a restart.\n\n\nA: Be patient. After approximately 10 minutes (!) with the new setup the Airport Utility was finally able to find the Time Capsule under the new configuration.\n", "Q: HDMI/Displayport audio control for OS X I have a Macbook Pro Retina, running OS X 10.10.5, and a BenQ GW Series GW2765HT monitor, which does not allow audio adjustment via my computer. I've tried Soundflower, but find that it is buggy and crashes. Is there any other way to control volume from my computer?\n\nA: I'd recommend MonitorControl:\n\nMonitorControl allows you to control your external monitor brightness,\ncontrast or volume directly from a menulet or with keyboard native\nkeys.\n\nMonitorControl is available on GitHub and as a Homebrew Cask:\nbrew cask install monitorcontrol\n\nA YouTube review is available here.\nTested on an \"LG 27UK850-W 27\" 4K UHD IPS\" monitor with HDR10 and USB Type-C connectivity and FreeSync, white:\n\n\n\n\n\nA: You can't use your Mac's system volume control to manipulate the volume on an HDMI/DisplayPort interface.\nBasically, the HDMI signal includes digital audio that was encoded in PCM (Pulse Code Modulation) format.  There are two main components to PCM and those are bit depth (how much of the audio signal is sampled) and the sampling rate (how many times per second the data is sampled).  There's nothing in there that handles volume.  \nTo put it another way, does your HDMI source like an XBox, Playstation or Blu-Ray DVD player have a volume button or does your TV handle the volume for you?\nIn order for you to control the volume from your Mac, you would need to do one of two things:\n\n\n*\n\n*Obtain or develop software specific to your television/display that would embed control signals onto the HDMI signal (similar to Sony's Bravia Theatre Sync\n\n*Use a [USB Infrared Transmitter][3] to send volume controls from your Mac to the TV/Display.  Note:  The only software I was able to find that works with USB IR transmitters is IR Control\nHowever, based on the price alone, I would probably just stick to my universal remote and be done with it.\n\nA: Have a try of Boom 2, it's a paid app that does exactly what you're looking for http://www.globaldelight.com/boom/index.php\nTo be honest, in my opinion, even though Soundflower is buggy and crashes, if you can get it working, it's the best solution to this annoying problem.\n\nA: I found myself in a very similar situation a few months ago. Being a Computer Science student, I decided to make an app to solve the problem.\nIt's called DisplayControl, and it's a great, non-intrusive app that runs in the background and hides in the menu bar.\nNow most of these apps (like Boom 2) add another layer between the source and the output. That's not great, as this can only make it more distant from the source. However, my app connects directly to your display trough a protocol called DDC. Basically, what the app does is it simply changes the settings of your display. So say your display's volume is set to 80% and you need to turn down the sound quickly, all you need to do is hit the hotkey or tap the icon in the menubar and slide the appropriate slider down. No need to use your display's terrible built-in menu again. If you want to find out more about it, all you need to do is go to http://displaycontrol.netne.net. It's the website I created for the app. You can find out more about it there and of course download the app. Let me know what you think of it!\n\nA: This answer recommends using Soundflower to fix this issue.  Maybe it has improved since you tried it?  I used Homebrew to install it on my Mojave system, and it works flawlessly:\n$ brew cask install soundflower\n$ brew cask install soundflowerbed\n\nRemember to give Soundflower whatever permission it asks for in system preferences.  Set system audio output to Soundflower (2 chn) and the Soundflower audio output to that of your monitor, and you should be good to go.\n\nA: Just wanted to add as mentioned here that eqMac2 works straight away after installing. No settings to change, just install and the volume buttons start working. Open source and free. Easily best solution.\n", "Q: Boot iMac from Macbook The new MacBooks are the best\n\nBut their processors are pretty anemic.

The non-El Capitan (Yosemite) workstations show the normal names. \nWhat could be wrong?\n\nA: Are you sure that all workstations are connected via AFP? \nI bet you get the strange folder names because of mangled names = yes (the default) in the samba server configuration. Check Synology bad filenames or Samba name mangling for more information. One solution is to disable SMB on the NAS another is to force OS X to connect via AFP e.g. afp://user@servername/folder via \"Finder->Go->Connect to Server\". \nOf course you can set mangled names = no in the Samba configuration but this creates problems when you connect via SMB to the server.\nSamba (SMB) creates the strange names when the file or pathname contains the characters / ? < > \\ : * | \", with AFP it's not a problem to read or write file or pathnames with these characters but not with SMB (Samba). \nSince Mavericks (10.9) Apple prefers the SMB protocol over the AFP protocol, check Mavericks Core Technology Overview PDF for more information. For Mavericks (10.9) it is SMB2, for Yosemite (10.10) and El Capitan (10.11) it is SMB3. \nFrom the PDF-Dokument: \n\nSMB2 is the new default protocol for sharing files in OS X Mavericks.\n  SMB2 is superfast, increases security, and improves Windows\n  compatibility.\n\nSo the future is SMB3 not AFP but the problem is that you have already files with the characters / ? < > \\ : * | \" somewhere on the NAS because with AFP it was not a problem to create such files but when you read these files via SMB you get the mangled names, so first you have to fix the filenames via AFP or go directly on the NAS (via ssh) and fix the filenames there.\nBetter is a newer version of the Samba-Server >= 4.2 (maybe with DSM 6.0 from Synology?) with the module vfs_fruit which adds Apples SMB2+ extension to Samba. SMB on the Synology NAS is slow for Macs because of the missing module vfs_fruit (and because the Samba-Server has the version 4.1). So if you use only Macs, turn off SMB on the Synology NAS and use AFP only (for the moment) but if you need SMB on the Synology NAS, well... fix the filenames, turn off AFP and try SMB but... test if the speed of the SMB share is good enough for you.\n", "Q: Programmatically 'auto hide menubar' in El capitan I really love the 'auto hide menubar' option in El Capitan, but sometimes I like it (private) sometimes I don't (work).

I ended up with the generic app icon.  So I went to \"get Info\" on the app and when I clicked the icon at the top and tried to paste the copied image, the size of the app changed (i.e. megabytes on disk), but the icon still did not appear.\nTo fix this, I right-clicked the app and selected \"Show Package Contents\".  I went into the subfolder Contents->Resources.  There was no appl.icns file there, so I converted my image to icns format using the image2icon app (free from the mac app store).  I then named the file \"appl.icns\" and dragged it into the resources folder.  This did not change the appearance of the app's icon immediately.  I had to then go into \"Get Info\" again and paste literally any image and it then updated to the image I'd saved as appl.icns in <*.app>/Contents/Resources.\nNote, I had tried pasting images into the get info window of type png, tiff, pict, icns, and various correctly sized versions of these formats.  Nothing was working.  I think that at some point, my computer had run out of application memory which might be how I got into this situation because I had previously created another fluid app which I had been able to paste an icon onto in the usual way.  I'm due for a restart, which should ultimately fix my issue, but I've got too many open projects at the moment.\n", "Q: Dock crashes on network aliases to offline server I have several shortcuts to network folders in my dock.

Is this possible? \n\nA: I am sure that this is not possible with an iPod Touch. It's not even possible on iOS so unless your carrier allows blocking of MMS and you forgot iMessage entirely, you're not able to control the feed into messages app.\nIf an iPhone were in play, you could disable iMessage and MMS so allow only SMS text messages, but again, that would require a cellular connection. \n", "Q: Is it possible use USB tethering feature of ios devices as similar to andriod?

If an iPhone is on wifi, it will not share an Internet connection with another entity in relation to tethering. In fact, if you turn on tethering while connected to a wifi, it will disconnect from the wifi automatically before sharing Internet. \nI recommend that you instead pickup an inexpensive USB wireless adapter.

As soon as it mounts, you remove it safely, shutdown the virtual machine, or uncheck the device, reversing the step [1]. \nIf it doesn't automatically shows up on your Mac, you can unplug it and plug it again.\nPs.: This method was done using a Virtual Box VM, but it'll probably work using Parallels, VMWare or even a Live CD (usb) Linux Distro.\n\nA: As suggested by the Apple help info, when erroring during the eject, logging out from the session (Apple logo > Logout) and coming back was enough to eject it.\n", "Q: Remove folder name from file name based on existing Apple Script so I have this apple script here that I used to insert the folder name into the front of all the files in the folder.

I have an ATEN CS1944 kvm that works just fine with everything up to and including Yosemite. When I convert machines to El Capitan the the KVM and the machines freak out when the kvm shifts focus away from the El Capitan machine and then ultimately requires a reboot of the affected machine to get things going again.\nTried numerous work arounds and tweaks with no success. Between this kvm issue and the other issues that arose with the converted machines not playing well as XSAN clients (kept randomly failing to auto-mount the xsan volumes) upon machine startup, I had to bite the bullet and fall back to Yosemite on the 2 converted machines that were attached to the KVM.\nI guess it will be a wait for KVM firmware updates and or OS X patches / fixes to try again after the product matures a little more.

On Snow Leopard, I had a Windows 7 partition that I had installed from a burned DVD, and everything was working fine. But I had to reformat the HDD to install ML, and so now I'm looking to reinstall a Windows 7 partition.\nFirst off, I think my Superdrive is failing. I insert the DVD I used to install windows before, and it just whirs away for a few seconds and then spits it back out. When I try and re-burn the original .ISO file to a new DVD at max speed, it gives me a \"burn failed because of a medium write error\". When I try and re-burn it on the slowest speed, it starts successfully, and then when \"finishing\" it spits the disk out (instead of mounting the image) and says \"burn failed because of a medium write error\" again.\nHowever, I have an external DVD drive. So when I tried going through the Bootcamp Assistant, it recognized the disc on this drive, and everything seemed to be going fine. It got the partition set up, and restarted the computer as it should. However, when it came time to reboot, I got a black screen with \"NO BOOTABLE DEVICE -- INSERT BOOT DISK AND PRESS ANY KEY\". Am I right in assuming that this is because the OS doesn't know to scan my external DVD drive upon booting up?\nAfter I manually rebooted, erased the failed Windows partition, and rejoined the empty space to my Mac partition, I tried this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmHxkahbK-g\nBecause I'm on Mountain Lion, there isn't any native support in Bootcamp for creating a bootable USB Windows install. So as the video suggests, I edited the .plist file, and made a USB bootstick from there. However, when Bootcamp rebooted this time, I still got the same error. Even when I manually rebooted and held down the option key, it didn't recognize my USB stick.\n\nMy question is a two-parter:\n(1) How can I verify that my Superdrive is failing, and if it is indeed, can I get it replaced? Mind you this computer is almost 6 years old now.\n(2) This user had the same problem, except they eventually got their Superdrive to read the disc: Unable to install Windows via Bootcamp without superdrive (mountain lion)\nCan anyone else offer some alternative suggestions? I don't have much faith that I'm going to get my DVD to stay in the Superdrive. Is there some other way I can have it recognize my external DVD upon rebooting?\nThanks in advance!\n\nA: Apple has a service provider lookup at https://locate.apple.com and I would start with an authorized service provider. Those era Macs aren't that hard to open and work on and the cost you might pay might make a DIY repair more likely than the more modern Macs that are designed more for factory trained technicians and have adhesive and very fragile connectors that you typically replace rather than reseat.\nAs to your failures, one bad drive can bring down the entire storage controller and/or bus, so you might open and just disconnect the superdrive to see if that helps the other storage devices work.\nhttp://ifixit.com might be the best place for a take apart and quick quote on the parts you might need for that repair.\n", "Q: Should I be worried about doing a hard reset on my iPhone? ​Just for my curiosity and knowledge, from a Software and Hardware stand point prospective, the other day I was having a discussion with some iPhone users.\nThe topic was the Hard Reset that you can apply by press and hold both the Sleep/Wake and Home buttons for at least ten seconds, until you see the Apple logo. As you already know, most of the time, this method fix so many iOS issues.\nNow, some of them say that it is safe to do, as many time you want the hard reset, some other say that even if it is safe to do it, it is always recommend to have an iCloud or iTunes backup before do the hard reset due to kernel panic, lost of pictures during the rebuild of the library, etc.\nWhat is the real answer on that?\n\nA: A hard-resart is perfectly okay to do. However, I believe some may be mistaking this for a DFU (Device Firmware Upgrade) which has a similar process of initiating and will essentially force you to restore or wipe your device.\n\nA: A hard restart is perfectly fine to do. I do it multiple times every week, without issues, and I never worry about not having a recent iTunes backup before I hard restart my iPhone or iPad. All one is essentially doing by holding the home button and sleep/wake button is turning the iDevice off, then back on, it just saves a little time and in some cases is necessary due to the normal way to power off an iPhone not working due to the iPhone not responding.\n", "Q: Run Terminal Command from .terminal file I just figured out how to export settings from terminal which creates a .terminal file.

Is there anyway to get it to give me a new prompt line for more commands?\n\nA: In the .terminal file, RunCommandAsShell should not be set to <true/>.\nThis correlates to the \"Run inside shell\" checkbox in the \"Shell\" section of the preference window; which is more intuitively named.\nWhen the preference is not selected (RunCommandAsShell is true), then the default shell is replaced with whatever command you've used.

Without a proper backup (e.g. Time Machine backup) all your apps and documents are gone.\nIf you don't have a backup, shut down your Mac immediately to decrease the probability to overwrite the erased data accidentally. Create a thumb drive/prepare an external drive with a bootable OS X system and install a data-recovery tool (e.g. Testdisk), boot your Mac to the external drive and try to recover as much of your data as possible to an external hard drive.\n\nA: I'm afraid so, yes.\nThe linked guide assumes that Step 3 will be to restore from a Time Machine drive.\nIt does seem singularly lacking in warnings, though the method itself is sound\n- for one, that you need Time Machine, secondly that you need to have previously 'purchased' Yosemite otherwise it will not appear in App Store as an option, thirdly that as they are recommending an Internet Recovery, the OS you should have ended up with is the one that originally shipped with your computer; from where you then re-upgrade to any other previously owned OS.\nAs already mentioned by klanomoath; your next step is recovery.\n", "Q: How can I let two iTunes installation use same iTunes folder?

I hope this does not sound confusing.    \nThese two iTunes are now downloading podcasts individually, yes they download to same location but they don't recognise what is already downloaded. What am I doing wrong? or missing?\n\nA: If you use one remote library location for iTunes on two machines [real or virtual] then even though the data location is shared, no other information is.  \nEach iTunes believes it is fully in charge of the library.\nIt is unaware that any other iTunes is changing data in the library & won't spot that a file already exists which it doesn't already have in its database.\nIn essence, iTunes is a write-only structure, it doesn't read the info from the library itself, only from its own Library.xml & .itl files. Dropping a new file into the Library by any method, including from another copy of iTunes, won't make the other iTunes notice it's there.\nOne workaround - which I'm not sure I'd actually recommend testing without solid backups - could be to symlink the .xml & .itl files together, across both machines.\nThere's a guide on symbolic links on HowToGeek\nEssentially, linking the two sets of library files as one single structure, which either iTunes could read/write to.  \nObvious downsides would be\na) there would be no lockfile protection, were both iTunes attempting to write at the same time.\nb) the file hierarchies would have to be identical on each machine, as iTunes file references are absolute, not relative.\n", "Q: Upgrading OSX on a three partition hard without losing bootcamp I have a three-partition hard drive on my MacBook pro mid 2009: \n1) Snow leopard (10.6.8) on Macintosh HD with 175GB free \n2) DATA on a FAT32 partition \n3) Windows 7 on a Bootcamp partition with 85GB free\nI have installed windows from within the OS X, following the Bootcamp instruction, then I have created the third partition and did some \"recovery\" on windows side to have all three partitions working properly.\nNow after some years, I want to upgrade Snow Leopard to new OS X (El Captain). \nI downloaded the new OS X from App Store, and tried to upgrade, it started the upgrade process but then it failed saying that it cannot upgrade on this partition. It suggested to change the size of Macintosh HD by at least 128 MB, and re partition it, so that it would fix the errors, and the new os x would install. So, I shrank the macintosh HD partition by 1.5 GB, and repartitioned. Still no good.\nSo, not that my Snow Leopard is upgraded, but also my Bootcamp startup option is also gone now.

This means you have 5 partitions (if you include the hidden EFI partition). The \"BOOTCAMP\" partition is the 5th and last partition. The Apple software is designed by default to search for Windows on only the first 4 partitions. This is why you can not startup to the \"BOOTCAMP\" partition. \nThe easiest fix would be to delete this partition using the Disk Utility application. The space could then be added back to the \"Mackintosh HD\" partition. I have not used the OS X 10.6.8 Disk Utility application in a long time, but with the newer OS X versions, sometimes this application can fail to properly delete partitions. So, beware and you probably should have a backup of important files.\nb) how to upgrade to el captain, maintaining three partitions and the windows installation?\nI am not sure why El Captain would not install. Are you sure you first upgraded OS X to version 10.6.8? Also, I do not think shrinking the \"Mackintosh HD\" partition by 1.5 GB would help. If anything you would need to erase files to create more available storage. I believe you need 8.8 GB of available storage.\nIt is possible to maintain the three partitions, but requires an effort. The problem is Windows can only be aware of four partitions per HDD or SSD. For your internal drive, you currently only have four partitions. (The first partition is a hidden EFI partition.) Installing El Captain will introduce a fifth \"Recovery HD\" partition after the \"Macintosh HD\" partition.  There are three ways around this problem:\n\n\n*\n\n*Delete the \"Recovery HD\" partition. You can optionally first copy\nthis partition to a flash drive if you wish. The problem here is\nthat some later update will probably recreate the partition, so you\nwill have to do this again later.\n\n*Use some free third party utility like gdisk to manual set which\npartitions Windows can access. The problem is the Disk Utility may\nreset the manual changes back to the defaults, requiring you to\nmanually set them again later.\n\n*Put the Windows and FAT32 partitions before the \"Mackintosh HD\"\npartition. The problem here is that you need to reinstall Windows or\nuse a third party tool to move the partitions. If you reinstall, you\ncan not use the Boot Camp Assistant to create the Windows partition.\nPersonally, I chose this method. You can use the Snow Leopard\ninstallation DVD to create the partitions.\n\n\nNote: If during installation you are asked about Core Storage, I would advise to avoid using it. You do not need Core Storage unless you want to encrypt your disk.\n\nA: Definitely not the best way, but this is how it worked for me:\n- delete all the extra partitions, and merge with the Macintosh HD. (so that you have only two partitions Macintosh HD and Bootcamp)\n- create a partition, 128 GB, format, can be FASTFORMAT\n- shrank the macintosh HD by 1.5 GB\n- upgrade to El Captain\n- delete the extra paritions, and merge with Macintosh HD, so that you have only two partitions: Macintosh HD and bootcamp\n- For me this worked very well. Now I can boot into windows, and the bootcamp options appears in the startup disk again.\nthe only downside is that, I deleted the El Captiain recovery disk, and the installation process did not make one.\nI do not have the El Captain Recovery Partition. In the forum you can see how to make a USB recovery partition.\n", "Q: Where are the alert tone audio files located in OS X?

It organises your keys in a central location for you to access in an adhoc fashion. I'd argue that a keychain also mitigates risk of you losing any one of your keys accidentally. Food for thought... would you leave your front door unlocked with your keychain (including other keys) sitting freely in the key slot?\nSo the Mac Keychain is conceptually the same, it organises your cryptographic keys and mitigates risk of loss by securing it with your Mac password. Given that your password IS the entry point keychain, you got yourself a chicken and egg scenario. But anyway, I would sternly advise you not to pursue this idea any further. If somebody stole your device or remotely logged into it, and you had your system automatically logging you in, you'd be handing over your keys to a potential thief. In some ways, this might be even more dangerous than compromising your physical keychain.\nSo by concept, the Mac \"Keychain\" would be referred to in general IT terms as a \"Key store\", that is responsible for facilitating the storage of private and public keys. What you are asking for is essentially an \"Authenticator\" or an SSO (Single Sign-On) solution.\nMy recommendation: if you configure your everyday user account as a non-administrator, then you should be able to have it auto login to OSX. You shouldn't be using an administrator or Root level account for general purposes. If you get hacked or attacked by malware while logged in as an admin then youve pretty much handed over those admin rights to the Malware.\n", "Q: How to store SSH Credentials in Terminal I am new to the MacBook and I am running El Capitan.\nI'm migrating my machine usage from a PC to a MacBook.

As long as they have public key authentication enabled, and your public key is present on the remote machine, you can ssh to the machines without having to supply a password.\nFirst you'll need to generate a public/private keypair like so:\nssh-keygen -t rsa\n\nFollow the prompts. When it asks if you want to protect the key with a passphrase say YES! It's bad practice to not password-protect your keys and I'll show you how to only have to enter the password once in a while. \nIf you already have keypair you can skip the step above.\nNow, assuming your ssh key exists on your Mac as ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub, you can install it on a remote machine by running:\ncat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh user@123.45.56.78 \"mkdir -p ~/.ssh && cat >>  ~/.ssh/authorized_keys\"\n\nFor your specific server example cited above, the command would look like:\ncat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh -p 2200 root@123.456.789.012 \"mkdir -p ~/.ssh && cat >>  ~/.ssh/authorized_keys\"\n\nYou'll have to enter the password for root@123.456.789.012 to perform this copy, but this should be the last time you need to do this. Assuming the remote server's sshd is setup to do public-private key authentication, when you ssh to the box now it shouldn't ask you for a password for the root account -- instead it'll ask you for the password for your key. Read on for how to make this something you don't need to enter all the time.\nRepeat the above for every machine you want to ssh in to with your keys instead of a password.\nPlease note, anyone who gets a hold of your ~/.ssh/id_rsa file can ssh to this machine as root without supplying a password for the remote machine. Password protecting the key file ensure they'd need to know the password for that key to use it. Make sure that file is secure. Use disk encryption on your Mac and keep the permissions on the file and the ~/.ssh/ directory tight.\nTo make it easier to use the key without having to enter the password every time, OS X runs an ssh-agent process in the background on your machine. This agent will cache the keypair the first time you use it so you only have to enter your password once in a while. If you only sleep your mac, never restart it, you can go long periods of time without needing to enter your password.\nYou can pre-cache all your SSH keys with the ssh-agent by running:\nssh-add\n\nNow you only need to remember the key password, not the many different account passwords. I usually keep my key passwords in 1Password (no affiliation), further simplifying how many passwords I need to remember. Then I just look them up in 1Password and cut-and-paste them in the Terminal the odd time I restart my Mac and cause my running ssh-agent to be restarted.\nIf you combine copying your key to remote machines with the Terminal.app connection management solution in this question, you'll have something very close to PuTTY for GUI connection experience.\n\nOn the server side, check /etc/ssh/sshd_config and make sure:\nPubkeyAuthentication yes\n\nis enabled in the configuration (it is by default in OpenSSH). You may also wish to set:\nPasswordAuthentication no\n\nWhile you're there so password-based authentication is disabled and keys become the only way to access the machine.\nYou'll need to restart sshd on the machine if you make any changes to the configuration file.\n\nA: In addition to the public/private key stuff, the .ssh/config file can be configured to ease use of ssh commands, like aliases, defaut user/port per server, ssh options, proxy commands...\nBasically anything complicated you can put in a ssh command can be in this file too.\n\nA: I have ported Putty to Mac as a native application bundle, so no need for macports or terminals if your not a technical user.\nMore information with screen-shots is here : http://www.wine-reviews.net/2016/08/putty-for-mac-os-x-now-available.html\nCheers,\n", "Q: I cannot send GMAIL using Outlook 2016 I have Outlook 2016 and I'm trying to pickup my gmail using IMAP.

Looking into that now, but I know how to get around the permissions problems you are having with sudo.\nYour syntax is wrong for sudo, the shell redirection \">\" is happening without elevated privelleges.

I hope I do not have to disable the  hidden file visibility in order to disable .DS_Store from appearing on the desktop.\n.DS_Store constantly gets in the way in the desktop but not in any other folder.\nI have a specific strategy in mind to remove .DS_Store on the desktop only. I would like to run an automator app that scans the desktop as a watcher. As it watches changes on the desktop, I would like it to detect the addition of a .DS_Store file and once it detects it, it would automatically move it to the trash (or a folder aside from the desktop.) \nI am running El Capitan (osX 10.11) on a Macbook Pro.\n\nA: I use XtraFinder, and it has the option to show all hidden items except for the desktop.\n", "Q: One iCloud account for multiple users I have my own iPhone and iPad and my boys iPods on an iCloud account. I've since added my boys iPhones on the same account so that I can monitor and control their apps and purchases. \nHowever I'm now getting calls and texts on my iPhone that are sent to them and when I send a text it shows as coming from their phones. \nDo I need to set up separate iCloud's to prevent this happening?\n\nA: Yes. From Apple's perspective, one Apple ID = one person. If you want to share that Apple ID, it also means that all those sharing that Apple ID will have access to all the same things (purchases, texts, emails, etc.)\nYou may want to look into iCloud's Family Sharing, which allows up to six Apple IDs to be designated as belonging to one family. That allows the family to  share each other’s iTunes, iBooks, and App Store purchases without needing to share an Apple ID.\n", "Q: How can I verify that an iOS app has or has not been updated? Today I noticed that an app needed to update. Updates is set to be done automatically, but did not update as it normally would.\nWhen I entered the updates list it just started blinking between the Update- and Open-button, and mostly as Open. After reading the question \"Can't update apps in iOS App Store; can only Open\" I force quitted the App Store app hoping that could do the trick, hoping the app would appear again with the update. When the App Store restarts the update is gone and has still not appeared in the list after an hour.\nThe app in question was the Facebook Messenger app. I know by looking at the information in App Store that there were in fact a release of the app today.\nHow can I verify that the app has or has not been updated? \n\nA: You can check the version of Messenger installed by going here:\nSettings > General > Storage (& iCloud Usage) > Manage Storage > Messenger\nVersion will be displayed next to app icon.\nAnd you can check the latest version of Messenger in the App Store by going to its page and check the version.\nIf they are the same, you are good to go. If not, I suggest closing App Store, restarting your iPhone and then checking App Store. It will probably says Update and you can do so.\n\nA: Sadly, there's a problem with the concept of \"update available\" since there is no one server with a truth to which version of an app is live. Even if you check the version on your device and what the \"store\" says online or in iTunes - there can be short periods (think an hour or two typically) of disconnect where your device doesn't \"pull\" the update.\nApple maintains a fleet of servers (like a CDN - content delivery network) across multiple geographic regions to handle the update requests of literally millions of devices. So, even if you were to snoop on the traffic between your one device and the server you were selected to connect to by the technology that directs a request for one resource to the actual server that will answer that request you might find that the problem you describe is that the server you connect to doesn't have the \"updated\" app yet so you no longer see it.\nOver a 8 hour time window, I've rarely seen apps get pulled once they are started to propagate, but I do two things to help manage this that require some setup, but make updating far better at avoiding the situation you describe:\n\n\n*\n\n*Set up MDM so I have profiles that collect installed app details from all my devices. This costs money, so many people won't do this for small deployments.\n\n*Set up OS X Caching Server\nThere are some nice articles on Caching Server but in essence, your local Mac becomes part of Apple's CDN and you can download apps from your own private store. Yes, one update still has to go out to Apple's servers and download the initial asset, but once it's local, all other requests are very much accelerated. It also speeds up iCloud data, Mac App store and anecdotally - I seem to get updates and app updates faster when I'm using caching server than if I were to go on LTE and check an update directly to Apple.\nI have a Mac Mini and dedicate an external 1 TB drive to store caching data but even if you had a modest 200 GB cache, most app updates would be much faster.\n", "Q: How to run a Tiger 10.4.11 virtual machine?

I am in the process of copying one of the 400GB using Finder and it is estimating 15 hours and after 3 hours of copying, it looks like a fairly accurate estimate.

Like you, if I edit the Siri-created notes, they sync. In addition Siri won't create iCloud notes on that device (which is why I have reverted to Google notes.)\nMy work-around is to move all the notes to iCloud, which I then process on my Mac. That way, they keep the same time stamp, and I can do this in bulk on my iPhone 6 S (Notes.app) using Edit → Move All. Obviously not helpful if your other devices don't use iCloud.\nmy old iPhone 5, which I've kept, has none of these problems. Yet both my phones use the same OS (9.1). I'm considering keeping the old phone for Siri note-taking purposes until this gets sorted out, as I rely heavily on this feature. \nI've logged a bug with Apple Bug Reporter.\n", "Q: Siri can't text someone even though it can call them, email them, and show me their contact information I ask Siri to \"Send a text message to John Smith\". I get a response, \"You have two contacts named John Smith, and neither has a phone number or email address\". However, if I bring up John Smith's contact information in Contacts, I see only a single card and that card has his emails and phone number. \nIf I ask Siri \"Show me John Smith's contact information\", I see John Smith's contact information. If I ask Siri \"Where is John Smith?\" Siri will show me where John Smith is in the Find my Friends App. If I ask Siri \"Email John Smith\", Siri replies \"Which email address for John Smith\" and shows me all of his email addresses. If I say \"Call John Smith\", Siri calls John Smith.\nAnd, if I bring up the contact, and press the little speech bubble, I can text John Smith that way. And, I can also ask Siri to display John Smith's contact information and send him text that way too.\nThe issue only seems to be with text messages. John Smith also has an iPhone and uses iMessage.\nAny idea how I can get Siri to find John Smith's email address or phone number when I text him? I have no problems with email or phoning John Smith through Siri -- just texting through Siri.\n\nA: Okay. I fixed the problem — at least so far.\nDeleting the entry did nothing. I recreated the entry, it initially worked, and then failed five minutes later with the same problem.\nOn my iPhone, entries are \"unified\". For example, my wife has an entry for someone, and I have an entry for someone, it shows up on my iPhone as a single entry. On my iPad, these show up as multiple entries. If Facebook creates an entry, a third one shows up.\nI want to my iPad, and there were three entries for this name — two had email and phone numbers and one did not.\nDeleting that mysterious third entry worked for about two minutes, but it reappeared a minute later, and I had the same issue again. I ended up editing that third entry and added a phone number and email addresses. That allowed me to text John Smith through Siri. It so far has held for two days. I can once again text John Smith through Siri. However, other people who have Facebook profiles and are in my phone book aren't an issue. It was just this one.\n\nAddendum\nThe problem was tracked down to Facebook being allowed to munge my address book. This user didn't have phone or email information in Facebook, so Siri must have seen the Facebook info, and tried to use that. On my iPhone, the contact entries are unified, so I see both what Facebook puts in and my entry.\nTurning off Settings->Facebook->Contacts solved the issue.\nThere maybe similar issues with other contact applications like Twitter and Outlook which might cause Siri not to see the information you have for a contact. Turning off these app's ability to update your contacts may solve the issue.\n\nA: My wife was having this exact problem with a few of her contacts (but just the ones she wanted to send text messages to the most). I found that I was having the same problem with several of my contacts. We both got new iPhone 7 Plus phones recently. \nI was finally able to solve this problem by getting Apple to delete the cache of data from each of our phones that Apple stores on its servers to process Siri requests (which includes the contacts from the phones). To get Apple's servers to delete the cache for your phone, do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Settings, Siri, then turn Siri off. \n\n*If you get a warning that this will remove your information from Apple's server (and it will take some time to rebuild it if you\nlater decide to enable Siri again), then skip to step 5.\n\n*If you get a note that says that Apple will keep your data on its servers to support dictation unless you also disable dictation, then you will need to disable dictation.\n\n*To Disable dictation, go to Settings, General, Keyboard, then scroll to the bottom and toggle \"Enable Dictation\" off. Now you should see the warning about your data being deleted from Apple's servers.\n\n*For good measure, turn your phone off (press and hold Power button until you get the \"Slide to turn power off\" message, then slide).\n\n*Turn your phone back on.\n\n*Go back to Settings, Siri, and turn Siri back on. \n\n*If you turned off Dictation, turn it back on.\n\n*Give your phone a few minutes to rebuild its cache of your data, then try Siri again. It should be working properly now.\n\n\nThis worked on both my phone and my wife's. I hope this is helpful to others that run into this problem.\n\nA: Is the phone number you have for him labelled \"Mobile\" rather than \"home\" or work? That could possibly make a difference.\n\nA: I had the same problem where Siri would be able to pull up my wife's contact and even call her but not text her. Finally fixed that by going into Settings > iCloud and turning on Contacts.\n\nA: I could solve it if I turned off my Outlook sync of contacts and just used a local copy. Then once I tuned the Outlook sync back on, Siri again said there were no numbers for that person.\nI ended up creating a new contact with the first name and last name the same, with the same phone number as the original contact and that seems to have fixed it, but now I need to remember that if I'm texting my wife to use her first name twice!\n\nA: I tried all the above. Failed. Then l went into my contacts, sent a message direct from the contact screen; then next time I asked Siri to send him a message voila!!! It worked!!! Finally\n\nA: I deleted my contact completely and re added it and made sure the phone number was listed under \"mobile\" rather than home or work.

Seems to have worked thus far\n", "Q: The product distribution file could not be verified When trying to install software from App Store on OS X 10.11, I get the error message \"The product distribution file could not be verified. It may be damaged or was not signed.\" I have tested several different pieces of software, and get the same issue on all of them.\nI have found a few suggested solutions, however they are from 2011, and refers to the /var/folders, which El Capitan does not have (I can't remember when it disappeared, but I think it was some time ago).\nIn the system logs, I see the following each time I get the error:\n\n09/10/15 19:28:04,476 storedownloadd[642]: *** Assertion failure in -[CheckPreflightOperation verifyDistributionAtURL:allowsDevSign:allowsUnsigned:osVersionToBeInstalled:error:distributionController:], /Library/Caches/com.apple.xbs/Sources/Commerce/Commerce-453/CommerceKit/CheckPreflightOperation.m:291\n\nWhen I browse to /Library/Caches, I do not see com.apple.xbs.\nAs my first attempt to resolve this issue, I renamed /Caches to /Caches_old (paranoid, I guess, but the practice has stood me in good stead previously, so I think it's not the worst idea in the world), then closed and reopened App Store, and retried the installation.\nI was now prompted to re-enter my iCloud password. I did so, and was presented with a new error message: “%Program% failed to download. Use the Purchased page to try again. In the Purchased page, the program had a line next to it, saying “An error has occurred”.\nOnce more consulting Console, I get this:\n\n09/10/15 20:22:16,130 sandboxd[114]: ([314]) storeaccountd(314) deny mach-lookup com.apple.backupd.sandbox.xpc\n  09/10/15 20:22:17,347 storedownloadd[642]: SSDownloadAsset caching-server-locator-timeout 10\n\nI tried renaming the old Caches-folder to Caches - no go.\nI tried renaming the Caches-folder to Caches_Old, and then creating a new Caches-folder - no go.\nI rebooted the computer - no go\nI renamed the new Caches-folder to Caches_older, then renamed the Caches_old-folder to Caches, and rebooted - no go\nAny ideas?\nUpdate: I have also tried renaming the Caches-folder, and then rebooting. A new Caches folder is then generated, but the problem remains the same.\nUpdate 2: I have tried starting the Mac in safe mode and trying it there.

If I get a failure there, I know the problem is on Apple's side or in the network. \nIf not, I have the app and know my system / library are not helping and can take action there once I'm sure the issue is with my customizations and specific install and not a server issue. \n\nA: I have resolved the issue by retrying on (yet another) network. I had previously tried two networks, one of which was my home network, but it seems all of them had some sort of issue. On a different network today, it worked fine.\nI think that the solution was to boot it in safe-mode, but I cannot be sure.\n\nA: This answer did not help me, and it took four apple support techs before I got one (iApps) who figured out the drop dead simple answer.  This answer does not apply to the above problem, but it has the same error message, so I'm posting it here for the next person who has an equivalent problem.  \nThis error message seems to be the last ditch answer from the App Store when it does not recognize something that is too new for it.\nWe could not complete your update.\nThe product distribution file could not be verified. It may be damaged or was not signed.\nFor example, on Yosemite, I cannot open .pages files sent to me from users who are already on El Cap.  When I try to upgrade Pages, as it suggests, I get this error.  The only way around it is to upgrade to El Cap so I can upgrade Pages.  Not ready to go there quite yet, so I'll just ask for the files in some other format for now.\n\n\nA: Below works from me. \nUsing Terminal run below command\nopen $TMPDIR../C/\n\nAbove command will open Finder window. In this window, find folder com.apple.appstore and delete it.\n\nA: I had the same issue while trying to update an app from the Mac App Store. I fixed it by switching to another network.\nI cannot download the app from my home network and encountered this error. Then I switched to my iPhone's 4G network using hotspot, and I downloaded the app successfully.\n\nA: the solution is to agree to the new terms and condition all the way at the bottom if you press the update all tab....hope this helps\n\nA: How do I accept the Terms and condition, I don't see that in the Mac App Store. I restored my old MacBook, and it goes all the way to 10.8.5 :-) and it was running Seirra before I restored. when I try to upgrade it to Maverick or El Capita or Yosemite or even Mojave, I keep getting the same error. It is very frustrating\n", "Q: How to stop decryption of external drive I've searched on the internet for a while and asked my question on apples website discussions.apple.com as well, however I haven't found and answer yet and people aren't responding on apple's site so I'd though I'd give it a go here.\nSo, I have an external drive (1TB) that I made journaled encrypted when I first started using it. By now I also have some video files and pictures on them that I'd wish to show on my TV. However, whilst encrypted I could not view the files other than on a Mac (I was trying to view them on a media player connected to the TV). Thus, I opted for decrypting the drive, since I used up almost 900 GB of the 1TB there are quite a lot of files and I understood the process might take a while.\nThe thing is, every time I plug the hard drive in it starts taking up storage space. I use a Macbook Pro and don't have a lot of storage space on the macbook itself, hence the external drive and why this is really annoying. To be clear, it is my MacBooks storage space that gets filled up when I plug it in, since this happens every time I can't use the drive on my Macbook anymore either, because every time I can only use it a few minutes before I get warned that \"My macbook is almost out of storage space, please remove some files\". When I unplug the drive I can literally see the free storage space increasing. So some process is taking up storage space whilst it is working on the drive.\nI thought this might be spotlight but I'm not sure since it could also be the decrypting process copying files or something. Is there a way to know why my storage space get filled up, and if its the decrypting, is there a way to stop this process so I can copy my files to another drive? And if it's spotlight is there a way to disable this because putting the drive in the privacy tab of spotlight is somehow also not doable.\nI don't mind wiping the drive, but I do mind wiping it without backing up the files on the drive (Yes, in the future I will back up my files better so this won't be an issue again), so a solution to stop the storage filling up is very welcome.\nThanks in advance!\n\nA: The first thing I would do is open Spotlight system preferences and disable indexing of the external drive. It is a privacy setting.\nNext, disconnect from the Internet and restart the Mac with the external drive connected. You might need to free up 5 or 10 GB of space to let things have enough room to sort out the decryption. \nThere isn't an abort that I'm aware of, but you can use diskutil cs list to get a reading on the encryption / decryption progress and plan if you want to let it run or if you'll need to take the external drive to another Mac to let it finish. \nIf you have a second USB drive, you could install a clean OS onto that drive and hold option. Boot to the empty/vanilla OS on the USB drive and let the external decryption complete. \n\nA: I figured something out. I talked to an Apple adviser online, they said there is no way to stop the decryption process. My problem was that I started the decryption on an external disk that had some problems, so the decryption got stuck, and every time I connect the decryption resumes, so many important files on that disk were inaccessible, as there is no way to even pause the decryption.\nI found a solution how to access the files (and copy them to another disk) without the decryption process. For that you need to enter the Recovery Mode, plug in 2 disks, the one that is being decrypted and another one. Then open the disk utility, mount the decrypting disk, enter the password. As you can hear (if it's not SDD) the decryption is not running.\nClick in the Menu open the startup disk. Close the Startup disk. Open the terminal with disk use commands to see the names of the disks. You can use ls /Volumes, diskutil list then use the commands to copy the files from one disk to another. I use this one ditto -V /Volumes/My\\ Corrupted\\ Disk/FolderOne /Volumes/My\\ Good\\ Disk/FolderFine, it copies a certain folder from the corrupted disk to the fine disk. In this case it is FolderOne to FolderFine. As you can see, don't forget extra slashes if some names of paths or files are with spaces.\nYou can research other commands to copy files by yourself. It seems that the Terminal app in the Recovery Mode is working seamlessly like in the normal macOS.\n", "Q: My Today Extensions in El Capitan are all missing I was using my Mac over the weekend when I decided to change the song on iTunes from the Today Extension in the sidebar. I swiped to bring the sidebar into view and\n\nHmm... not there (also no Weather, etc.) OK, I'll open up the Edit interface and\n\nok, nothing there either. I'll just open up \"Extensions\" in System Preferences and turn things on\n\nNothing there either (there should be a fourth entry on the left hand side for \"Today Extensions\")\nI have a second machine at work that doesn't have these problems. Both on the same version of El Capitan.\nIn the interest of full disclosure I am running El Capitan 10.11.1 beta 3 because I didn't opt out of beta updates to the GM quickly enough (was on beta 1 when I first noticed) but like I said my work machine is on the same version/beta and doesn't have these issues. And I was on beta 1 for days before I noticed. \nAny idea what I can do to get my extensions back?\n(also, my Time Machine backup outgrew my hard drive so rolling back isn't an easy option)\n\nA: Figured it out. \nThere's some solutions for Yosemite I found online but none of them worked for me. \nTurns out part of the issue is that El Capitan introduces System Integrity Protection (SIP) which is causing the bug, or it's preventing the fixes from working, or something. \nAnyway I got the answer from here. Basically you just\n\n\n*\n\n*Reboot in Recovery mode (CMD+R at the chime)\n\n*From the recovery menu pick Terminal\n\n*Run this command to (temporarily) disable SIP: csrutil disable\n\n*Reboot into El Capitan\n\n*Verify that the extensions are back in the sidebar and in system preferences\n\n*Reboot in Recovery mode again\n\n*At the Terminal re-enable SIP with run csrutil enable\n\n*Reboot back into El Capitan. Everything should still be back and all is well. \n\n", "Q: How do you edit someone's iCloud contacts with a different iCloud account/e-mail address? Okay, so I've been searching far and wide to figure out how to do the following:\nI need to edit my boss' iCloud contacts. Usually I log into her iCloud but she does not want me to do that anymore because I can see her e-mail, etc. \nIs there a way that I can access her iCloud contacts using my own e-mail address? I am open to suggestions about third party apps as well. \n\nA: Note be careful here, while this answer works it can add a level of confusion and might have side effects that I didn't consider.  I did try it tho, and it works.\nCreate a new Apple ID. Most easily done by going to http://appleid.apple.com from a computer browser. \nOn your bosses phone go to Settings > Mail, Contacts, Calendars and tap Add Account.  Add the new Apple ID you just created. Once authenticated, turn off the switches for Mail, Calendars, Reminders and Notes-- leaving only Contacts turned on.\nNow the phone has two sets of contacts, her old set and a new empty empty set.  Only the original set is displayed tho.  To change that open the Contacts app and click \"groups\" in the top left corner.  Note that on this screen you can check one or both sets of contacts at the same time.\nNow go to the computer and export all her contacts from the original Apple ID and import them to the new.\nOnce the new set is ready for her to use, make sure to turn off the old set using Contacts > Groups on her phone.  Also go to Settings > Mail, Contacts, Calendars and in the Contacts section change the \"default account\" to the new group, so that any new contacts she creates on the fly will go to the new group.\nTo save confusion you could also remove all the contacts from the old Apple ID. Also open Settings > Mail, Contacts, Calendars and edit the original Apple ID turning the contacts switch off.\nNow the contacts are stored under a separate Apple ID and you can log into that Apple ID on iCloud.com to edit them.\n\nA: iCloud does not support delegated management.\nYou could potentially add the iCloud account to your computer and only enable functionality for Contacts, but you could go in and enable email at any time so it really isn't any privacy advantage for your boss.  \nThis would be done in System Preferences, then under \"Internet Accounts\".\n", "Q: Boot camp assistant: Size of winddows support software download My boot camp assistant has been downloading \"windows support software\" for a long time.

Thank you!\n\nA: copied from my question about the same issue:\nedit 01-11-2019: Works on Mojave.\nThere is a solution - plugin called winBuddy which is available through MacForge (previously known as mySIMBL).\nIt allows you to turn off window shadow and/or window borders for every app.\nI've just tested it and it seems to work properly, there are some minor glitches here and there but nothing major.\nMinor glitches include:\n\n\n*\n\n*You can't change window options for apps which don't have menu - like Bartender for example\n\n*You can't change window options for some apps, as winBuddy does not show up under 'Window' in menu.\n\n\nA: To quote many sources, namely Reddit and Life Hacker(to disable system integrity protection):\n\n\n*\n\n*Reboot your Mac into Recovery Mode by restarting your computer and holding down Command-R until the Apple logo appears on your screen.\n\n*Click Utilities > Terminal.\n\n*In the Terminal window, type in csrutil disable and press Enter.\n\n*Restart your Mac.\n\n\nThis should work.\n\nA: The Apple System Integrity Protection prevents system files from being tampered with including styling of the UI. For this reason you cannot modify the window without disabling the System Integrity Protection. However doing so may put your Mac in danger. Therefore if the SIP was disabled malware or malicious content could modify or corrupt important system files which are required for the OS to run normally. However the side effect of this is restricted customization.\n", "Q: How do I access my old files from an old Macbook HDD with Lubuntu? I wasn't sure if I should put this on the Apple or Linux stack exchange but here's my problem. So my old Macbook died a while back and I realized that it might have had some important information. My main PC now is a Lubuntu Desktop. So what I did was I bought a SATA with an HDD power connecter to USB cord and I plugged the SATA side into the HDD and the USB into my PC. I was able to get into the HDD's files, but when I was getting into the documents file it said that I could not access it due to permissions. So I changed the permissions and when I clicked apply it said \"Error setting permissions: Read-only file system\". Can someone tell me how to save the information on the HDD while being able to access it?\n\nA: This is probably due to your FS type and your old disk which is probably HFS+.\nYou need to add extra packages to read it.\nTry this link: https://askubuntu.com/questions/332315/how-to-read-and-write-hfs-journaled-external-hdd-in-ubuntu-without-access-to-os\nHere's the copy paste of the answer :\n\nFirst, make sure that you have hfsprogs installed. Example installation command:\nsudo apt-get install hfsprogs\n\nNext, mount or remount the HFS+ drive; commands need to be as follows:\nsudo mount -t hfsplus -o force,rw /dev/sdXY /media/mntpoint\n\nor\nsudo mount -t hfsplus -o remount,force,rw /mount/point\n\nFinally, if the drive was improperly unmounted or has otherwise become partially corrupted run fsck.hfsplus ... as such:\nsudo fsck.hfsplus -f /dev/sdXY\n\n\n", "Q: Get contacts from broken iPhone 4S My phone was knocked out of my hand and fell screen side on the ground. I have an off-brand case and my screen will not show anything except for a flash when I press the home button. My phone is currently not connected to an iCloud account and My lock button is broken, how to get my contacts off of my phone?\n\nA: If your phone is linked to an iCloud account, try surfing to https://www.icloud.com and login with your credentials.  Once logged in there is a Contacts app which should contain your address book.\nIf you don't have iCloud you could use iTunes as stated above, but it won't let you access your contacts directly.  Try alternative applications such as Syncios, Appandora or iTools.\nIf that's not an option you could try to backup your old iPhone with iTunes and restore it to another iPhone.\nAnother option is to replace the screen and hope for the best.  While repairing a 4S might not make sense, there's cheap refurbished or OEM screens available.  If you don't want to use it afterwards, it till makes a great gift for any kid.  Replacing a screen on a newer iPhone (5 and above) is dirt easy, but replacing one on a 4 or 4S is absolutely not for the faint of heart.\nIf none of the above work out for you I'm afraid it's a lost case.\n", "Q: Mid 2014 Macbook Pro Retina 15\" monitor daisychain I recently bought 2 Dell U2715H monitors to use in a daisy chain configuration to save on thunderbolt port usage.

Original answer left below for posterity...\n\nA commercial ($20) option is Paragon ExtFS for OS X, which supports read/write mounting of ext2/3/4. I'm using it now in El Capitan.\nIt has a few annoyances, such as seemingly not paying attention to mount options specified in fstab... But generally seems to do the job fine.\n\nA: Don't use Paragon ExtFS for OSX with El Capitan.The port is very experimental despite the fact that Paragon claims support for El Capitan.\nI've damaged two times a 1.5TB ext4 filesystem beyond irreparable limits, using two independent installations of EL Capitan (10.11.3) on a MacBook Pro and MacBook Air. fsck -y /dev/sda(x) on an linux box after file transfer completed is claiming hundreds of thousands multiply-claimed blocks with several files and directories - filesytem gone!\nExtFs is also not implemented in DiskUtilty in Ela Capitan so you can't check the integrity of your filesystem nor format in ext2/3/4...\nParagon Guys please fix your software urgently! Your claim supporting El Capitan is very much misleading!\nIn Summary dump Paragon ExtFS with OSX 10.11.x and not waste your $20 or wind back to Yosemite or earlier OSX's.

Are you expecting to turn on your Mac and have it automatically log in as you? \nIf that's the case, the encryption does not have that as an option. You must provide your account password or the recovery key in order to unlock the encryption before the OS can boot.\nIf my understanding is incorrect, would you please provide more details about the problem you're seeing?\n", "Q: No voice feedback when using Siri with American accent in iOS 9.0.2 I'm using Siri with American accent in iOS 9.0.2.

by:\n\n\n*\n\n*deselecting iCloud sync for Notes\n\n*opening Notes\n\n*reselecting iCloud sync\n\n\nSo far so good...it crashed after ~5 sec before, now all appears well.\n\nA: In my case was Safari that closed randomly for weeks. I resolved it by doing the following\n\n\n*\n\n*Delete Safari with AppCleaner\n\n*Mount OS X recovery partition with \ndiskutil mount Recovery\\ HD hdiutil mount /Volumes/Recovery\\ HD/com.apple.recovery.boot/BaseSystem.dmg cp -R /Volumes/OS\\ X\\ Base\\ System/Applications/Safari.app /Applications\n\n\n*Install Pacifist then open OS X Installer and install Safari with Pacifist.\n\n*In iCloud disable Safari and then enable it\n\n\nA: I had this issue with TextEdit and Preview. Deleting the com.apple.xxx files in ~/Library/Preferences/ and ~/Library/Components as suggested on other forums didn't help. At best it solved the issue for a couple of days.\nProblem was coming from wrong permissions on some font files. Repairing permissions on the Fonts folder solved my issue.\nOpen Terminal and type\nsudo /usr/libexec/repair_packages --repair --standard-pkgs /Library/Fonts/\n\nYou will be asked for your password (sudo means get super user powers)\nRepairing permissions used to be available from the Disk Utility app but Apple removed it since Mavericks or Yosemite for some reason.\n\nA: As with most of you, I just had the same issue.  I combined a couple of different suggestions (e.g., Capt G) from this thread to find a solution for me:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Internet Accounts\n\n*Select the \"Exchange\" account if you have one set-up.\n\n*Uncheck the Notes app in the window to the left showing the apps associated with the Exchange account.  Keep this window open.\n\n*Open Notes.  Notes stayed open for me, with just the iCloud data available.\n\n*Close Notes.\n\n*Now, in the Internet Accounts window check the Notes app in the window to the left associated with the Exchange account.\n\n*Open Notes.  This time the Notes app stayed open for me with all my original data.\n\n\nI hope this helps!\n\nA: Finally found a solution for this after months of trying various different things. (Tried pretty much every solution, individually or in combination). What finally worked for me was:\nMaking sure that all internet accounts had synching off for notes (including iCloud) in the system preferences\nGoing to /users/[name]/Library and doing a search within that folder for any file containing “Notes” in the name.\nmatches were found in both /users/[yourname]/Library/Containers AND /users/[yourname]/Library/GroupContainers\ngoing to /Library/Caches and selecting all and moving to trash\nSelected all such files, threw them in the trash.\nEmpty trash\nReboot\nOpen Notes\nTurn on synching for iCloud\nPresto! It worked! For the first time since I installed Sierra pretty much, it finally worked on my computer again! So I’m not sure which file it was exactly that I deleted that did the trick, but my best guess is that deleting the notes related files in “containers” is not enough, you must also go after the related files in “group containers”.\nThere we go! Hope this helps somebody else!\n\nA: Same for me.  Under El Capitan, on one of my Macs, Notes crashes every time that I try to open it.  I tried turning off iCloud synch, but that did not help; Notes keeps crashing.\nNext time I reboot, I will trying running Notes in Safe Mode -- for the first time only! -- to see if I then can open it up normally thereafter in regular mode.\nHave you tried that, anyone?\n\nA: Solution: Remove MS exchange account in internet accounts. Notes app will not crash upon opening then add your MS exchange account again.\n\nA: No solution from me.\nNotes.app still crashes.  My issues seem to relate to fonts. The Font Repair process didn't fix it.\nIf I have an unusual font, it crashes.  If I change the first line of text to a Heading, it might crash.  If I try to print, it might crash.  Frequently it fails to pop-up the Print dialogue.\nMoving to Evernote or equivalent.\n", "Q: How can I identify and uninstall all apps installed by a certain user? I have a Macbook that was also used by a previous employee of my job. I made the mistake of not reformatting the entire thing when I installed it. Now I have a new Mac app store ID, but the apps previously installed under his ID keep asking for his app store password - my assumption is this is to update themselves. \nHow can I identify and uninstall any apps previously installed under a different Mac App store ID other than my current one?\n\nA: I think your best bet might be to come at it from the other end of the problem.\nOpen App Store, sign is as you if you didn't already, then check your own Purchased list.\nAnything not in that list will belong to someone else.\nUnfortunately, that will likely include the OS itself, which may cause future issues, especially if you don't know the old user's credentials, or if they ever change the password.\nWipe & start afresh would have been better, in the long run.\n", "Q: Change html files to txt on entire folder Is there a mac terminal command to change all .html files to .txt including the files in sub folders too?\n\nA: I guess actually you just want to rename them. Run the following from inside the folder. If you do not trust the command, add echo before mv to see what it would do.\nfind . -type f -name \"*.html\" -exec bash -c \"mv {} \\`dirname {}\\`/\\`basename -s.html {}\\`.txt\" \\;\n\nThis does the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Looks up every file (-type f) in the current folder (.) whose name is ends with \".html\" (-name \"*.html\")\n\n*It than finds out the path of the file (dirname), adds a slash (/) and the name of the original file without the \".html\" suffix (basename -s.html) and adds a \".txt\" suffix.\n\n*Then it renames the original file (mv).\n\n\n\n Actually, the ` ` notation for using a programs output as part of a command is deprecated. $() should be used instead, but in the case of find the backticks are easier to use. \n\n\nA: for-loop\nfor file in *.html; do\n   mv \"${file}\" \"${file%.html}\".txt\ndone\n\nThis 'for loop' is just one way to do it.\n\nA: rename\nYou can use rename which you can install using brew.\nInstall rename using brew: brew install rename\nRename files using rename:\nrename -s .html .txt *\n\n", "Q: I need to download photos from iPad, to Microsoft Windows my Windows computer wont read them off ipad becuase they are saved in icloud, if i disable icloud will photos still be on device that took them (the ipad)? or any suggestions on how to download photos from icloud faster. \n\nA: When you say stored in iCloud do you mean the iCloud Photo Library? If this is the case you can go to Settings - iCloud - Photos and switch from Optimize Storage to Download and Keep Originals to download full copies of your photos back to the device. Turning off iCloud Photo Library will also give you this option. \nAnd as was also mentioned you can also log in at iCloud.com and get them from there. \nETA: there's also the iCloud for Windows option. \n", "Q: Can not run Xcode 7.0.1 on MacBook Pro I can not run Xcode 7.0.1 on my MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Late 2013, 4GB of RAM, 128GB SSD, 20+GB of free space, OSX 10.10.5). I downloaded the DMG file from Apple, and can run it on my Mac mini (Late 2012, 16GB of RAM, 1TB HDD, 200+GB of free space, OSX 10.10.5), but can not run it on my MacBook. The DMG file seems intact and I can browse the contents of Xcode.app; it is seamlessly copied to /Applications folder. There is no error code or whatsoever, except the phrase \"The application \"Xcode\" can't be opened.\"\nXcode 6.0.1 runs perfectly on my MacBook.\nAny thoughts?\nUPDATE\nI tail ed /var/system/system.log as patrix suggested and here's an interesting line:\nkernel[0]: exec of /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/MaxOS/Xcode denied since it was quarantined by Microsoft\\x20Remote\\x20Desktop and created without user consent, qtn-flags was 0x00000006\n\nWTH?\n\nA: Something similar happened to me when I first downloaded Xcode 7 onto my MacBook Pro. My solution was to copy the app onto my external hard drive, delete the copy on my internal drive, run the app on the external drive, then copy it back over to the internal drive. I've never had any problems with Xcode 7 since.\n\nA: I had downloaded Xcode on my Windows Server 2012 R2 and copied it to my MBP using Microsoft Remote Desktop for OSX. Apparently this had lead to the DMG file being flagged for quarantine. I simply removed the quarantine attribute in terminal using xattr\n", "Q: Fans in overdrive but fails to boot I have an Apple Xserve Intel Xserve3,1 with dual quad core cpu and 48gb ram.\nToday the system fans started going into hyperdrive (i.e. very fast and very high pitched) and was unresponsive to keyboard input and had no display.\nSo I stripped the system down, blew out the dust from the system, including the channel vents beside the drive slots and cleaned it out properly.\nHowever, upon restart the same issue occurred with the fans and the machine did not boot, although a huge amount of air is now expelled from the system whilst it is running.\nTried various things to get a fix:\nThis is sequence A:::\n\n\n*\n\n*Removed power from the machine.\n\n*Held down the start button for five seconds+\n\n*Held down the system identification button for 5+ seconds.  Other help sites suggest that this should toggle the boot sequence by flashing the blue lights on the front of the machine, but none of this eventuated.\n\n*Added power to the machine, still no change in behaviour.\nRemoved the fan block from the machine, and retried sequence A with no luck.\nRemoved the CMOS battery from the machine, and retried sequence A again with no luck, and rest times between power off and CMOS battery removal, again with no luck.\nPowered the machine up with the power button depressed.  At this stage something appeared to change in behaviour.  Reassembled the machine, inserting the battery and fan pack and placing it back in the rack.  At this stage the UPS decided not to power up, so using a separate power cord, booted the machine up.  All seemed to work as per a normal boot up, although I had no console the drives, cpu lights, etc, all seemed to do a normal boot and hum as per a normal system operation for a number of minutes.\nAfter resetting the UPS and getting it to power up, turned off the Xserve using the front off/on switch for 5 seconds and shut it down.  Plugged the UPS power into the machine and the original condition returned.\nTook the machine out of the rack, stripped it down again and went through the above procedures a number of times, with a non-ups power connection and was unsuccessful in achieving the same state I had attained before.\nThere is a switch in the middle of the motherboard (no idea on it's intended purpose but some online information tended to point me in the direction of thinking that it was a power management unit reset (PMU reset)) so I tried that whilst running, whilst unpowered, and whilst powering up for various time durations of holding it down, all to no avail.\nSo, in essence, it appears as if the machine thinks it is in a overheated state and I am unable to get it out that state through various reset mechanisms that I have tried.\nAnother point of interest is the yellow lock light next to the locking switch is half highlighted.  Turning the lock increases the illumination level of the lock light, and unlocking it returns it to the low glow level.\nCan anyone provide a solution to reset this machine so that it can boot again correctly please.\n\nA: The trick appears to be:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disconnect the power cord\n\n*Wait for 10 seconds until the front lights go out.\n\n*Insert the power cord.\n\n*Wait five seconds and then press the off button.

Let's say I have Bob Dylan Essential's, and I want to play it starting from 2nd song of disc 2. I double click this song in my library but, instead of playing all songs starting from this one, iTunes shuffles the entire album into the Play Next section. I've takes a screenshot with the result: \n\nHow do I play all songs in order, starting from a particular one?\n\nA: Sometimes it's just a case of persuading iTunes to actually Stop rather than Pause\nWhen you first launch iTunes it is Stopped - the top menu doesn't contain any current song info. If at that point you hit Play, it will actually start from just the first song in the list & continue on down the page [assuming you don't have shuffle enabled, of course].\nIf you double-click any track instead, then it will do the same, from that track - which is what you want...so...\nTo make it actually Stop, whilst it's playing, hold  Alt ⌥  & click the Pause button II\nYou might also notice the rewind button changes to a kind of 'orbiting' icon - that's to start Genius based on the current track - but not relevant to this issue.\nOnce stopped, it ought to return to 'normal' behaviour.\nIf it doesn't, an alternative is to enable, then disable shuffle.

In addition, in order to minimise the strain on the rather weak processor of my WD MyCloud machine, I made sure to run only one rsync process at a time. After that, I have had no problems syncing.\nThis is no general solution, of course, but then again there seem to be no general solution for this vague error message: if this had not worked, I had had to try and debug it.

You can spoof a MAC Address in that manner however the actual physical MAC Address of a NIC will always be that of which it was programmed until reprogramed in the EPROM. I changed my MAC to what yours reports, while ifconfig shows the spoofed address the actual physical MAC Address remains as it was originally programmed. Wireshark is reporting the spoofed address but that doesn't stop a hardware verification app that polling the actual physical hardware for its address from seeing the real address.\n", "Q: How can I remove photos from an iPad Min without having to restore it?

Is there a way to get these photos off my iPad mini without having to restore the device? I wish Apple would make it easier to simply delete photos from an iPad mini, but until that day I hope you can provide some options for us.\n\nA: What you ask it trivial on iOS 9. Enable cloud photos in iCloud settings if you haven't already. Once it's synced, turn of the library. \nSelect Remove and you are done. \nIf for some reason you can't or won't do that, connect to a Mac and you can use Image Capture app over USB to bulk delete.

If your disk is HFS formatted, here's a rumour here that you can just kill the process fsck_hfs and the disk reappears immediately (FSCK=file system consistency check). Next time I have a scan, I'll be looking for a fsck_exfat equivalent process to kill. Disabling the write cache would reduce risk, but not prevent the scan - it doesn't on Windows, and there's still the risk the disk was disconnected during a non-cached write.\nFor your question 2, leave the disk connected to your Mac for a while. OS X runs the same repair process, it just does it silently. (Someone answered my identical question here.)\nIn my experience disconnection almost never actually causes corruption (Windows tells you if it finds an error, and I've never, ever seen it find one) - but a flag File System State is set on the drive prompting the repair scan. On Debian, Ubuntu or Linux Mint, this can be disabled in /etc/default/rcS, on CentOS, /etc/sysconfig/autofsck - we need the OS X version..anyone?\nUpdate: klanomath answered question two here - I'll report back once tested.\n", "Q: How to emulate mouse right-click in Microsoft Remote Desktop?

Shift-F10 should be the same as the context key.\n\nA: Though this is old, this issue just hit me but I was not getting satisfactory results with the trackpad changes mentioned above. However, I was able to get something that works well for me using Keyboard Maestro. I created two new macros and restricted them to run only when Microsoft Remote Desktop application is active. Both macros use the \"Move or Click Mouse\" action, one set to emit \"center button\" and another set to emit \"right button\".

Or is that too high?\naddendum> the application is processing video constantly, the only 'interaction' is the video feed coming from a webcam.\n\nA: Zero is Ideal\nIdeally, your kiosk application should use 0% CPU when not actively being used. It is unlikely you will achieve this without considerable effort but even a target of 5 – 10% use is good.\nAt 150% constant CPU use, the application would likely be considered faulty by Apple's Mac App Store reviewers – and by many customers.\nHints: Offload to the Right Framework\nIf your kiosk application is animating or showing moving content such as adverts or movies, do as much as you can with AVFoundation/QuickTime. This will typically offload the processing to the GPU and allow the CPU to idle.\nFor other animations be sure to adopt CoreGraphics and CoreAnimation. They will dramatically improve your application's energy impact.\nEnergy Efficiency Guide for Mac Apps\nStudy Apple's Energy Efficiency Guide for Mac Apps. The introduction sets out Apple's intentions:\n\nYour Obligation as a Developer\nEven small inefficiencies in apps add up across the system, significantly affecting battery life, performance, responsiveness, and temperature. As an app developer, you have an obligation to make sure your app runs as efficiently as possible. Use recommended APIs so the system can make smart decisions about how best to manage your app and the resources it uses. Whenever possible, avoid unnecessary updates to the user interface and I/O. Power-intensive operations should be under the user’s control. If a user initiates a large iMovie render, Automator batch job, Compressor conversion, or Xcode compile, for example, the user should not be surprised if the activity consumes power. Strive to make your app absolutely idle when it is not responding to user input.\n\nUse the developer tools to profile your application's energy impact and ask away on Stack Overflow for ways to reduce CPU load. Good luck!\n\nA: 150% of the total CPU would, of course, not only be totally unacceptable - but physically impossible.\nI know most sportsmen seem to think that they can give at least 110% every time they are interviewed, but no-one pointed out the simple facts to them, I guess ;-)\nActivity Monitor shows individual applications' CPU usage per core [including virtual cores], so 150% is actually (for an i7, with 4 cores + hyperthreading) 150 / 8 = 18.75% of the total machine capability.\nThe System + User total underneath the individual figures is a more accurate representation of the overall machine usage & a quick tot-up of the figures gives you a rough idea that this is in fact the true state of things.\n\nTaking this as an example, the visible percentages add up to about 120, yet the System + User figure is only 5.3%\nI have 24 virtual cores [2 x 6-core CPUs + hyperthreading] so 120 / 24 = 5 [close enough to account for the processes further down the list]\nAt 18.75% of the total machine's capacity, I don't see it being worth the effort to optimise - unless another process needs any significant portion of the remaining capability.\n\nA: Unless you have a problem, don't prematurely optimize would be my advice. The hardware will run at 100% usage (or 800% of one single thread in your hardware's case) with no ill effect and unless you have blocking effects - your animations and kiosk functions might not even degrade when the CPU is totally busy 24/7.\nIf there are low hanging fruit to reduce CPU, go for it, but the i7 has 4 physical cores and calculates CPU loading against 8 virtual cores. Your hardware goes to 800% ideally and you are only at 150% presently? Seems like you specifications for hardware are more than overkill for a single use kiosk situation. If you have chosen a technology stack and are happy with the contents of the kiosk in terms of animation, ability to perform the task you are \"hiring\" it to do - I wouldn't worry about some externally imposed \"best practice\" even if it's Apple's guidelines to be an efficient coder (which are EXCELLENT by the way).\nOn any system, you might want to plan to not exceed 80% utilization if you cannot benchmark, measure, react and correct burst usages.

How can I get iTunes to reload metadata from those files?\nRight now if I just begin playing a file it will recognize the new metadata, but there must be some way to force iTunes to do this in bulk.\n\nA: Try breaking the ITL file & make iTunes rebuild it.\nDon't just throw it away, & don't launch iTunes until there is a broken .itl file in place - that will not produce the desired result...\nFirst, move the existing iTunes Library.itl to the desktop, just in case.\nDon't touch the .xml, just the .itl file.\nIt can be found in ~/Music/iTunes/\nThen… \n\n\n*\n\n*Delete the existing ITL if you left a copy in the iTunes folder.\n\n*Open Terminal & enter this touch ~/Music/iTunes/iTunes\\ Library.itl That will create an empty ITL file, broken enough for our purposes.\n\n*Launch iTunes. It will now notice something is 'wrong' & start rebuilding the ITL file, using your existing XML file. The message is 'Importing ‘iTunes Music Library.xml’ This will take some time, maybe 15 minutes or so, depending on your Library size.\nBreaking it rather than not having any .itl file there at all makes the difference between several minutes & several hours for the rebuild, & also how much playlist & other metadata is successfully kept.\nYou may find some album artwork missing - it never seems to be a truly perfect solution, but your play counts, playlists etc should all survive intact.\n\nA: If you only want to scan a few files and don't want to wait 15 minutes for your itunes library to reload, here's an applescript that will view the info for the track (which re-reads the tags from the file).\non run {input, parameters}\n    tell application \"iTunes\"\n        reopen\n        activate\n    end tell\n\n    repeat 100 times\n        tell application \"System Events\" to tell process \"iTunes\"\n            keystroke \"i\" using command down\n            key code 53\n            key code 125\n        end tell\n    end repeat\n\n    return input\nend run\n\nmake sure you are in \"view as -> songs\" first so that the keys work.\nAlso another tip is to select the songs you want to scan, and determine the number of songs, then replace \"100\" with that number, so you don't end up with extra keystrokes. If you set the number too high it will re-open a the last file in the playlist repeatedly until it runs out of keystrokes, and at this point the applescript will have already finnished submitting the keystrokes, so can't be stopped.\n", "Q: Cannot open files from iCloud drive on Mac but they open on iOS devices I only use iCloud Drive for files I need to access on my Mac and my iPad.

Been through a bit of the suggested answers, nothing has been suggested that I haven't tried (unsuccesfully, as of yet), so I turn to the group for answers.\nI have a 2.5\" HD from an MacBook 2011-vintage. It was that computer's boot drive, and in fact will mount, and boot, a 1,1 Mac Tower that I've got it in.  It's running 10.6.8 (Snow Leopard). The drive has physical damage (bad sectors), and performs poorly to not at all during finder operations (eg, copy).  I've tried to recover the data on the drive (iPhoto/iTunes stuff, text docs, things that aren't backed up) using Data Rescue 3, to no avail so far - it sees the drive, but just hangs and becomes non-responsive.  Prosoft's suggestion is to clone the drive and recover from the clone. Sounds good, but...\nI've now got the drive on another MacPro system, in an eSATA dock, and am attempting to clone it to a fresh internal drive. I tried using the Terminal command dd, as was suggested in another post here, but after an overnight run nothing seemed to be happening. Currently, I'm attempting to clone it using Disk Utility's \"Restore\" tab...but it seems that nothing is happening beyond the \"Setup\" phase. \nIf specifying \"dd\", using the correct arguments to create nulls to fill bad sectors, makes a bit-by-bit clone...then why isn't it working?\n\nA: Your best bet when hardware is failing is Data Rescue and not any tool that tries to rebuild/minimize/rewrite errors.\nYou will need a second drive of equal capacity and time to let the software take several passes at reading the data to get the best results. But, unless you have a budget of $300 to $3000 and want to send the drive off for professional help - you can't do better than Data Rescue in my estimation and experience.\nData Rescue has professional support and many bells and settings to tell it to really try to access the data by hook or crook, so a call into them would be my next step as you indicated it's not working with your settings.\n\nA: I am a computer repair technician of many years, working on macs, windows systems, linux systems.

I can mount it read only but no set of options I've tried allow me to mount it read/write.\nThe fsck tells me that the catalog btree is bad and I can not repair it because there is not enough space left on the disk to allocate a new btree (these are messages I get from fsck_hfs).\nThe Apple support article says to just open the volume in the finder and copy the Backups.backupdb to a new drive.  When I try that, the \"preparing to copy\" dialog comes up.  After 26 hours, it is at 3.8 million files but it has stopped moving.  My fear is the btree is in a circular loop and it got stuck -- maybe?\nWhen I try to copy the old volume to a new volume using ditto, I get lots of errors about \"Operation not permitted\".  I believe the time machine disk has some fairly unique directory structures and I guess ditto doesn't know how to recreate them properly?\nI thought about using ditto and create a big cpio file but then what would I do to restore it?  I assume I would get the same errors.  And, I also have the fear that if the directory structure is really goofed up, it might not ever finish.\nTo be honest, this is not a tragic loss.  I could just reformat the drive and start fresh with backups and give up all of the historical data which, 99.99 chances out of 100 I would never want.  So, this is a bit of an opportunity to poke at it and see if I can find a way to recover the drive without any huge heartbreak if I destroy the file system mucking with it.  Or, I could just retire the drive and if I really really really need something off of it, I could mount it and pull just that piece off.\nAnother possibility is to write a program to traverse the tree keeping track of the inodes.  For each unique inode of a regular file, copy that file to the new disk using an inode unique path.  For each repeat inode, don't go down into the tree.  Also, in to a separate file, record the paths to get to an inode.  The big ICK there is all the extended attributes and ACLs that Apple / HFS has.  I don't know how to get the complete set of these things.  Is there more than just ACLs and extended attributes?  Perhaps such a critter already exists.\n\nA: I am simply going for an answer with this because I believe it is the only one.\nFirst of all don't use Finder. If you do, don't copy it all because Finder does not understand what a hard link is.\nIf you would like to keep the data in sort of the same structure you can use rsync with a version number greater 3. Not the version supplied by Apple. With that you would be able to copy the volume including hardlinks while preserving xattrs and permissions. With one caveat. Not the ownership because that is set to nobody right now.\nTmutil keeps track of it and you can inherit them on another machine/installation. But restoring seems (as far as my research has lead me) also to be limited to tmutil. While I am sure that there are certainly commands that would do this at will they are not documented in\nman tmutil\n\nIn order to get all data off you will have to run rsync as root. Which will then be the owner afterwards. Alternatively it will set them back to how they were but at nobody as the owner isn't that useful either. The rsync route would allow you to only copy the files that actually exist if you choose to preserve hardlinks. The resulting data set would be about the same size, should be identical in properties with the only difference being that the folders are now not hard-linked. Only the files are.\nPersonally I would be interested in trying to ask tmutil afterwards to adopt this data set. In any case you will then be able to browse the data freely.\nIf you just wan't to get all the unique data that is on the time machine disk you can ask fdupes to list hard-links as duplicates (it has a switch for that) and then have them deleted. This should leave you with one unique set. There will still be loads of files that are practically identical but not actually bit for bit. So it might be still messy.\nI have gone trough something similar myself. Basically Time Machine should either you once your backup has reached a certain age and tell you to start over. Because it is impossible to restore a working installation from a time machine backup that is a couple of months old (depends on usage, obviously). It simply becomes a really fragmented mess if it has to keep track of millions of files in order to create the consistent set at point X in time. The alternative would be to reconsolidate the sets permanently but that would mean that the resource usage of Time Machine would go up. For mobile computers that would also be unpractical since the disk would need to be connected for extended periods of time. If you like the idea that you can reinstall your computer to the state it was 1h ago before you installed \"xy\" or did some \"rm\"ing on something that seemed useless you better keep only 2 or 3 months worth of time machine around (again, depends on usage). Or start using rsync and multiple targets, either with a self written solution or with one of the commercial wrappers around it. Separating the Backup strategy for stored data and working data also helps.\nIf now someone will turn up an say that using something like ZFS Snapshots would be better then I can only recommend to test that for a couple of weeks and not just blabber on what is written on the internet. This does need considerably more resources to the time machine solution. If it is used for files that change a lot you either end up with pretty gigantic snapshots and are running out of disk space which won't be restored if you delete the snapshots in between. If you even can delete them, which is unlikely. Which only leaves you with the option to delete the oldest ones frequently but in that case Time Machine works absolutely fine as well. From my experience even better. Deduplications would need a very fine graded adjustment since so many files are altered every couple of minutes on OSX but are still kept for years.\nIncremental backups over a long time seem so of alluring but in practise that might not be the best approach.\n", "Q: Mail.app crashes after update to El Capitan OS Apple Mail app crashes for me nonstop after I updated to El Capitan.

Give the app plenty of time to download all messages until you no longer see \"Checking for Mail...\" at the bottom left of the app screen (may take a few minutes depending on how many messages you have on the server).\n\n*Once the app is no longer \"Checking for Mail...\" repeat this server for each of your other accounts.  I saved Gmail until last since it's my biggest, which took the longest - about 5 minutes (I use multiple Gmail accounts).\n\n\nAfter enabling all accounts, the crash issue stopped for me.

When I open Disk Utility, I see that the computer recognizes that I have a 250 GB SSD, but the Macintosh HD area seems to be \"partitioned\" for 204 GB. I have included pictures for clarification.\n\nThis is what the mac says about my SSD.\n\nHere is what the Macintosh HD looks like.\nIf I'm not mistaken, shouldn't the Macintosh HD size be the same as my SSD? How can I fix this, as I'm unable to find any tutorials to help me. I have tried to partition the SSD to try to be able to merge them, but I get an error saying: \"The provided Core Storage logical volume has an incorrect size. You should run whole-disk repair.\"\nI have run diskutil in terminal to find no information that is useful to me, but I have included it here in case it helps someone help me.\ndiskutil list:\n/dev/disk0 (internal, physical):\n#:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *251.0 GB   disk0\n1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1\n2:          Apple_CoreStorage Macintosh HD            250.1 GB   disk0s2\n3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.1 MB   disk0s3\n/dev/disk1 (internal, virtual):\n#:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n0:                  Apple_HFS Macintosh HD           +204.0 GB   disk1\n                              Logical Volume on disk0s2\n                             FEB0DA59-F214-4841-A491-59BFE7F9DEE4\n                             Unlocked Encrypted\n\ndiskutil cs list:\nCoreStorage logical volume groups (1 found)\n|\n+-- Logical Volume Group A7C277C4-D35C-48A1-AD85-135FC3FBBAAE\n=========================================================\nName:         Macintosh HD\nStatus:       Online\nSize:         250140319744 B (250.1 GB)\nFree Space:   45788061696 B (45.8 GB)\n|\n+-< Physical Volume 3A4B651C-DA22-4F22-96F3-A1C3D22BCE45\n|   ----------------------------------------------------\n|   Index:    0\n|   Disk:     disk0s2\n|   Status:   Online\n|   Size:     250140319744 B (250.1 GB)\n|\n+-> Logical Volume Family DBA55F9D-7D02-4191-B9C2-1CC1CB429E3C\n    ----------------------------------------------------------\n    Encryption Type:         AES-XTS\n    Encryption Status:       Unlocked\n    Conversion Status:       Complete\n    High Level Queries:      Fully Secure\n    |                        Passphrase Required\n    |                        Accepts New Users\n    |                        Has Visible Users\n    |                        Has Volume Key\n    |\n    +-> Logical Volume FEB0DA59-F214-4841-A491-59BFE7F9DEE4\n        ---------------------------------------------------\n        Disk:                  disk1\n        Status:                Online\n        Size (Total):          203999936512 B (204.0 GB)\n        Revertible:            Yes (unlock and decryption required)\n        LV Name:               Macintosh HD\n        Volume Name:           Macintosh HD\n        Content Hint:          Apple_HFS\n\nIs there a way I can get back the usable space onto Macintosh HD?

Thanks in advance for any help.\n\nA: Your main CoreStorage container has a size of 250.1 GB with 45.8 GB of unallocated container disk space.\nUsually you can expand the size of a Logical Volume to the full size of the Logical Volume Group if no other blocking Logical Volumes exist in the same group.\nThis is done with the command:\ndiskutil cs resizeVolume lvUUID size\n\nIn you case that's:\ndiskutil cs resizeVolume FEB0DA59-F214-4841-A491-59BFE7F9DEE4 250g\n\nIf the Logical Volume is encrypted it has to be unlocked.\n\nFailing to change the disk layout with Boot Camp Assistant often corrupts internals of the Logical Volume Group and the above command fails. Then you have to remove the Logical Volume Group and restore a Time Machine backup to an erased and JHFS+ formatted disk0s2 partition\n\nA: It depends! If the free space physically before the Macintosh HD then you need to backup and restore. This is quite difficult, and not really recommended.\nDid you try to \"run whole-disk repair\". This would probably need to be run from a Revovery console; hold ⌘+R while rebooting.\nThe answer to a question I asked may help. \nhttps://apple.stackexchange.com/a/209401/19086\nIf you can't resize you could try adding the free space to the Logical Volume Group.\n\nA: Since there is only a partition on your drive seen by macOS, you should be able to make a new partition with BootCamp Assistant. Make it of minimum size, it should \"eat\" all the free space on your drive. Then you can restore all of it via BootCamp Assistant.\nThat worked for me, I restored 502GB on my 3TB Fusion Drive.\n", "Q: from where can i download el capitan image other than mac app store? In my college mac app store is blocked so can someone please provide me a link to direct download el capitan from web?\n\nA: There's nowhere other than the Mac App Store where you can trust an installer to not give you a virus. If you have any place near your college with free wifi, going there to download El Capitan would be your best bet.\nAlternatively, if you know anyone off campus with a Mac, you can have them download the installer from the App Store and then get it to you by giving you a flash drive or by using an online service like Copy (a Dropbox-like service that gives you 15GB for free).\n", "Q: Troubleshooting IKEv2 on 10.11 El Capitan How do I troubleshoot IKEv2 VPN issues on El Capitan?\nI've followed these instructions to create an IKEv2 VPN (and certificate) on a Ubuntu server that I want to connect to, which all seems pretty reasonable. \nI'm now trying to connect to it from my Mac. \nI've created an IKEv2 connection with (what I think are) the appropriate details. When I click connect, the VPN menu icon just shows the connecting lights for 2 minutes but nothing happens. There is no output (error or otherwise) in /var/log/system.log or on syslog -w. There is no error message or evidence of any sort of connection attempt on the server. If I change the server address in the VPN config to something non existent, the results are identical, so clearly it's not really doing anything useful. \nHow do I find out what it actually thinks it's doing though?

But, before I updated to iOS 9.0.2, I still can use the define button. So what should I do to allow it to define the words I want?\n\nA: Go to Settings -> General -> Language & Region -> and make sure the languages you want your iPhone to recognize are in the \"Preferred Language Order\" list.\nIf the language you prefer is already in that list, tap \"edit\" to delete the language, and then add it back up. This should add the language's dictionary and enable the \"define\" function.\n\nA: Go to Settings->General->Reset->Reset Keyboard Dictionary.\nTried every other suggestion, this works.\n\nA: High light the word, his define then hit manage.

Is operating system support for firmware updates an actual problem, and if so how can I tell which SSDs are Mac-friendly?\n\nA: If you have a CD drive, you can update the firmware of Samsung's Sold State Drives (SSD). Samsung provide bootable disk images to update an SSD drive installed within a Mac:\n\nSamsung SSD Firmware Updates for Mac Users\nBelow you will find the latest firmware downloads for recent Samsung-branded SSDs. \n  ISO files may be used only via DOS using a bootable CD/DVD.\n… 840 EVO, 840 PRO, 840, 830 Series, and 470 Series …\n\nThe process is not friendly but it works. The disk image needs to be burnt to a CD, then you boot your Mac from the disc. The updating process takes seconds and is not complex.\nThe disc contains a cut down edition of Linux. The result is a text based interface:\n\nI recently applied the 840 EVO update and while my update was not destructive, you must back-up first. The update process explicitly warns that it could wipe the drive.\n", "Q: Multi user mac and iCloud data security I'm currently using a shared Mac with other users.\nAll user accounts are Administrators.\nI noticed that with sudo my files are accessible from other user, and I'm wondering if also my iCloud Data (Notes, app data ecc. ) are accessible and readable in the same way.\nDid someone has any clue?\nThank you\n\nA: An \"Administrator\" account has complete access to all other accounts through tools such as \"sudo\". To the extent that iCloud data is unsecured in the user accounts, it could be accessed by anyone with an administrator account. However, without the user's login password, access to information stored in the login keychain is not possible - so passwords to servers and websites and the like are reasonably \"safe\".\nThe simplest way to give reasonable secuity is to not make everyone an administrator - the standard setup requires administrator privledges to view files stored in other login account folders, so non-administrator accounts cannot view such files. If using non-administrator accounts is not feasable, one could create encrypted files and/or disk images to store private things.\nThe FileVault whole disk encryption does not do what you want, since it still allows full disk access to any administrator account. \n", "Q: How to remove duplicate devices in \"text message forwarding\" on my iMesssage setting (iPhone) I have reformatted my MBPr/MBP (have both) multiple times and now, they are also appearing multiple times on my iPhone (Setting => iMessage => Text Forwarding).\nAny ideas on how to remove duplicate/unused ones? Thank you\n\nA: *\n\n*Go to the iCloud website.\n\n*Log in and click on Settings.\n\n*Scroll down to My Devices\n\n\nFrom there, you should be able to click on any of the devices registered to your account and delete them. Good luck!\n\nA: If you reset your iCloud password, the old services will be removed from: Settings > Messages > Text Forwarding\n\nA: Let me know if I'm not understanding your question correctly, but here are 3 interpretations of what I think you're asking, along with solutions to each.\n1.) You want messages you delete/read on one device to also be deleted/read on all the others:\n\n\n*\n\n*All messages in blue bubbles represent iMessages, meaning, they're controllable within the iCloud ecosystem. So they'll work like IMAP - if you delete it once, it'll delete it everywhere. So you should have no problems there.\n\n*If it's the green bubble messages you're having problems with (SMS), disable receiving SMS on your mac by opening your iPhone settings:\nSettings -> Messages -> Text Message Forwarding, and turn off your enabled device/s.\n\n\nNote: this will disable the ability to send SMS from your Mac via your iPhone, but it shouldn't debilitate you too much since you can still send SMS from the iPhone itself. Again, if the receiver also uses an Apple Device, you'll still be able to send them iMessages from either iPhone or Mac.\n2.) If you're experiencing \"grouped\" messages, when the only people in the group are you and the person you're sending a message to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Check that you have your MMS Email Address entered on your iPhone (yes, I know this is a Mac question, but this is a real fix.)\n\n*Settings -> Messages -> MMS Email Address\n\n*If you don't know your MMS email address (the one provided by your mobile service provider), here is a list for the big three:\n\n*Verizon = YOURNUMBER@vtext.com\n\n*AT&T = YOURNUMBER@mms.att.net\n\n*Sprint = YOURNUMBER@messaging.sprintpcs.com.\n\n\n3.) If you're wanting to receive text to just one device instead of all devices:\n\n\n*\n\n*On your Mac, open Messages -> Preferences -> Accounts -> iMessage (displayed as your Apple ID), and uncheck \"Enable this account\".\n\n\nHOPE THAT HELPS!\n\nA: I also had multiple macbooks showing in my \"Text Message Forwarding\" preference screen, it was showing 7 macbooks even though there were only 2 on the \"Manage your APPLE Id\" web page.\nAlthough I was unsuccessful in removing them from the text message pref screen, I did discover that since activating any of them requires you to type in the code shown on your macbook, it becomes clear which one is the macbook you want to connect with, because either the mac opens the messages app and shows you a code, or it doesn't and you just deselect that device from the app and try the next one!\nAs a tip it's worth trying the bottom device first, as that was the one for me—presumably because they're in order of when they were first set up, so it was the latest one I'd signed in to.\n\nA: Change your iCloud password and that's it.\n", "Q: root permissions After I installed el Capitan, Little Snitch started complaining about gamed trying to phone home.

In split view on El Capitan Safari zooms-out some websites, making them unreadable (and making split view unusable).\nIs there any hidden setting to disable this?\nI tried to use setting in 'Advanced' preferences that is called 'Never use fonts smaller than X' - it does not seem to make any difference. Also there is nothing in TinkerTool about that.\nAs an example, this is how Chrome and Safari behave in the same situations:\n\n\n*\n\n*When Safari side takes minimum space, Safari completely \"zooms-out\" website and shows \"overview\" (?) of the web-page:\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*When Chrome side takes minimum space, it still shows normal font sizes without any special treatment. (Notice how this web page looks normally in Safari):\n\n\n\nThis effect looks cute, but is not very useful in my opinion.\nCan this behaviour be disabled, so Safari behaves like it does when window is just resized?\n\nA: Just scale it yourself with ⌘+. With the split in the middle, ⌘++ will scale it to 100%.\nFWIW I much prefer Safari's scaling—it should be a preference.\n\nA: I actually managed to prevent safari from zooming by setting the zoom mode to \"text only\" in View -> Zoom Text Only. Just be aware that this affects the way that safari zooms on the rest of your tabs, so if you zoom in, it increases the font size instead of the regular mode of zooming in.\n\nA: The \"Zoom Text Only\" option is gone in current Safari.\nSo I found the second best solution is to switch safari into the \"Reader Mode\"\n\n\nA: It is not currently possible.\nI would recommend you provide feedback via Apple's Safari feedback page.\n\nA: Its their show all tabs view, which is available via the icon on the top right of the browser.

The users login to the Macs with their Windows credentials and so far it has worked fine. Last week we changed the password policy so that password lifetime is now reduced. Since then two users (out of 100-something) have problems logging in to the Macs. One user keeps getting keychain-messages about Keychain not being able to access this and that (have updated the keychain-login). The other user can't log in at all. She keeps getting refused as if she had typed a bad password or username. She uses the same credentials on the PCs as she is using on the Macs, but the Macs just won't let her in. Does anyone have any ideas to solve this problem?\n\nA: My 5c from my AD experience long ago...\nLet me guess: the user which can't get in at all has changed her password on Windows due to the new password policy. And she tries to login to the Mac with her new password and that doesn't work.\nFor me, this sounds to me that this is a problem of an authentication cache or AD replication problem. To verify this, could you ask her to try the login on the Mac with her old password? If that is the case, her changed PW has not been synched to the Mac bound AD.\nHow is the Mac configured? Did you attach it to a specific AD? Could you check this AD server in the event log for replication or quorum errors or for login errors of this particular user? Any hints from the Mac logfiles pointing to an authentication error?\nNext idea would be to check her password, if she uses special chars which are on a Mac's forbidden character list (Colon etc.) But this is just a wild guess. You could try this by manually setting her PW as administrator on the AD server to some trivial stuff and let her try the login again.\n", "Q: El Capitan installed but App Store says there was an error I just updated to El Capitan.

I've looked in View Options and Finder Preferences.\nHere is a picture:\n\nA:  Cmd ⌘   Shift ⇧   T  will show/hide the tab bar (if there is not more than one tab already).\nIt appears that if you close a Finder window with the Tab bar open, then subsequent window will start with it open, even for a single tab.  \nSo I guess the trick is to always close tabbed windows one tab at a time, or remember the above key-combo for when you forget.\n", "Q: Can't use my 9.0.1 iPhone with Xcode My Macbook and my iPhone are updated to the OS X 10.11 Capitan and iOS 9.0.1, but when I try to use my iPhone as a running device with Xcode, it tells me I can't use it because of the version of them.\nI can't upgrade xCode (6.1).

I have a Macbook Pro 13\" and it's a mid 2012 model. It's hooked up to my TV through the HDMI cord as well as the mini display adapter and the display is great, but there's no sound at all. My computer recognizes the HDMI cord and that option is selected. It's also selected via the opt button then clicking the sound, as well as through the MIDI application. I have also tried two different HDMI cords with no luck. I've been looking around and absolutely nothing fixes my problem. I'm really confused as to how my computer could recognize all this being connected and still produce no sound. Can anybody help me figure this out?\n\nA: You need a mini DisplayPort (mDP) to HDMI adapter with audio support.\nOne like BlueRigger adapter should work perfectly for your application.\n\nIf you look at the Tech Specs page from Apple specific to your model, you will see that HDMI video with audio is supported.\nJust plug in your HDMI cable to that adapter and the other end into your TV and you are good to go.\n\n", "Q: Cannot see/accept/decline invitations from Exchange My wife and I send each other calendar invitations from time to time. She is on an Exchange account, while I am not. I have a variety of email accounts, including iCloud, Gmail, and non-iCloud, non-Gmail accounts.\nWhen my wife sends me an invitation, regardless of which of my accounts she sends it to, it doesn't appear in the Calendar app on either my phone or my Macbook. Instead, it simply shows up in the Mail app as an email with a .ics attachment. I can't see anything about the invitation without opening the attachment. This is especially bad with updates and cancellations, as I can't see what has changed, and cancelled items never seem to get deleted from my calendar.\nWhen I send her invitations, she has the same problems; invitations come through as attachments.\nWhat could be causing this?\nNote: we were both on the same Exchange server in the past, when we both worked at the same place, and had no problems sending, viewing, and accepting invitations on our phones and PCs. But we have had the problems above ever since I left that employer.\n\nA: This is not a great answer, but it's a workaround for now. I set up an account on Outlook.com. Invitations to or from that address work seamlessly, so both my wife and I can open each other's invitations, accept, decline, etc.\nThe downside is that this only works for events on my Outlook.com calendar. There's still no way to accept an invitation from her and put it on my iCloud calendar, and she still gets an attachment if I send an invitation from iCloud or some other account. So, I very much consider this a workaround, not a solution, and would appreciate any actual answers.\n", "Q: bash script to verify that brew cask is installed I am writing a script to setup a mac development environment, however I am running into an issue on some peoples macs where cask does not install.

But when I select a resource and click the Hex button, nothing happens. No error message, nothing in the Console log.  I tried nuking the Resorcerer preference file and increasing the RAM assigned to the VM.  Is there any way to get it to work?\n\nA: Since Apple discourages the use of resource forks in new Mac OS X applications and prefers the application bundles instead, I doubt you will find that much \"classical\" resource forks anymore.\nIf you still need a similar app try Rezilla instead. It works natively at least in 10.7-10.9.\n", "Q: iTunes music sync: \"Albums\" sub-window too tall for main window iTunes version 12.3.0.44 running on Windows 7 X64 with a 1920x1200 monitor.\nWhen a device is connected there is a window where you can manage what music gets synced to the device.  This scrollable top-level window contains 4 scrollable sub-windows labeled Playlists, Artists, Genres and Albums.  The two lower sub-windows (Genres and Albums) are both too tall to fit entirely within the top-level window, even when iTunes is maximized. Thus scrolling in the Albums window is a tedious combination of scrolling the sub-window and then having to scroll the main window to see things at the top or bottom of the Albums list.\nHere is a screenshot (reduced to 1/2 size) with the outer window scrolled so that the top of the \"Albums\" sub-window is at the top of the main window.\n\nNote that the bottom scroll arrow is off-screen because the Albums sub-window is too tall, even with the main window maximized at 1920x1200.\nThe only way to see the bottom few lines of the Albums sub-window is to scroll the main window down, as shown here:\n\nExcept now the top of the Albums window is cut off and the scroll button is not visible.\nIs it possible to tweak something to reduce the height of the Albums (and Genres) windows so they fit?  \nAlso, this is clearly a UI bug.  I'd love to know why obvious stuff like this remains uncorrected across many releases of the product.\n\nA: The suggestion from someone (\"turingtest2\") on the Apple Community forum was to submit this as a bug on Apple Developer Connection, which I have done.  \nThe bug number is 23139220.\n", "Q: How can I add custom week numbers to Calendar? Calendar.app on both iOS and OS X provides functionality to add week numbers. However, I'd like the week numbers to match a custom pattern (numbered by semester rather than by year). Is there a way I can do that?\n\nA: I do not know of any way of customising the existing function, so I suggest that you make an iCloud Calendar and make a repeated calendar entry for each semester. Example: Make new calendar named Semesters. Make an entry called 201516-1 and set the first Monday of the semester and repeat until the last. Continue making entries 201516-2, 201516-3, 201516-4 until you are done.\n", "Q: Anyway to add new processor to MacBook 5,1 or MacBook Air 204 I'd like to add a faster processor to my MacBook Air 2014 or my MacBook 5,1 unibody. Is this possible at all?\n\nA: Nope. MacBook Air processors (and RAM and storage, at least in that model) are soldered to the logic board, so there is no way to remove that processor from the logic board without destroying both of them.\n\nA: Short answer: no, impossible. \nLong answer: yes, but it's almost impossible. Processors are soldered to the mainboard in almost every laptop. It is possible to unsolder it and re-solder a powerful one (like the 2.66ghz from a 15\" 2008 Macbook pro). This process is called \"reballing\". But it will be expensive, and not so reliable. It's better to do it only if you are having problems with your processor and you have to reball anyway. \nIt's better if you forget about it, believe me. \n", "Q: iPad and iPhone no longer connects to iMac since downloading IOS 9.0.2 Since downloading IOS 9.0.2 my iPhone and iPad no longer connect to iTunes in my iMac (OS X version 10.6.8).

Then, I replaced the DVD with a SSD and made a DIY fusion drive. It was working properly until this year's May, when I cloned the \"regular\" HD and I couldn't boot on windows even when the partition and data were still there.

This time I realized that the output from terminal for all the commands is the same as in May, so I tried the same script again, but it returns an error and does nothing.

This prevents the fdisk command from changing the Master Boot Record (MBR). You will need to temporarily turn SIP off by following the steps below.\n\n\n*\n\n*Restart the computer.\n\n*When the computer restarts, hold down the alt/option key until the\nmenu appears showing boot options.\n\n*Select the Recovery HD partition for OS X 10.11.\n\n*Once booted, select the Terminal application from the menu bar.\n\n*In the Terminal application window, enter the following command.\ncsrutil  disable\n\n\n*Quit the Terminal application.\n\n*Restart the computer to return to El Captain, OS X 10.11.\n\n\nAt this point, you can repair the MBR on /dev/disk1. Once you have finished, you should turn SIP back on.\nTo turn on SIP, follow the above steps, except substitute the following command. \ncsrutil  enable\n\n", "Q: Does the new 12\" MacBook (2015) allow for dual displays, or just display mirroring?

I pulled out the RAM (in case the creds were in volatile memory), put the RAM back in, and lo and behold, it was still able to authenticate to the router.

Thank you.\n\nA: Apple's designated cloud photos solution is iCloud Photo Library using the Photos app on iOS and OS X. It stores and syncs your photos and videos in iCloud with one or multiple devices. It sounds like this should satisfy your requirements quite well (see the note below on iPhone storage).  \nRequirements:\n\n\n*\n\n*iOS 8.3 or later on your iPhone\n\n*10.10.3 (Yosemite ) or later on your Mac\n\n*Sufficient iCloud storage to hold your entire photo library \n\n\nThings to Note:\n\n\n*\n\n*iCloud Photo Library is not the same as Photo Stream. (What Photo Stream does exactly, is indeed not very clear. I would recommend just ignoring it or turning it off completely after you setup iCloud Photo Library.)\n\n*iCloud Photo Library syncs both ways. Photos you take on your iPhone will also appear on your Mac (and all other devices that use it). Edits to photos are also synced.\n\n*For each device you can choose whether to download the entire library or whether to optimize the device storage. On the devices where you choose the latter (your iPhone in this case), iCloud Photo Library will still take up some space. The space is managed internally and optimized for your device. It might keep things like thumbnails, favorite photos, photos you frequently or most recently accessed etc. Other photos are downloaded on demand. But the space used should be significantly less than keeping the entire library on the phone. Depending on how hard your \"no space\" requirement is, this might be a deal-breaker for you. I suggest you just try it out.\n\n\nSetup iCloud Photo Library:\n(Just to be safe, you might want to backup your photo library before proceeding.)\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure you are signed in to the same iCloud account on both your iPhone and Mac.\n\n*On your iPhone: Go to Settings > iCloud > Photos, then turn on iCloud Photo Library.\n\n*In the same menu choose Optimize iPhone Storage. \n\n*On your Mac: Open Photos (not iPhoto).\n\n*Open the app's preferences (menu Photos > Preferences...) and under the iCloud tab select iCloud Photo Library.\n\n*In the same menu choose Download Originals to this Mac. This will keep your entire photo library on that Mac.\n\n\nImport your photos into Photos:\nThis step depends on your current setup. If you currently use iPhoto on your Mac, the photo library should migrate automatically. In general though, you can just drag and drop all of your photos and videos into Photos on your Mac. \nFinally, let iCloud Photo Library upload and sync the library. This might take a while.\n", "Q: Apple Wallet (formerly Passbook) - Best way to add links Does anyone have any experience with Apple Wallet (formerly Passbook) - I'm interested to know if it's possible to add hyperlinks on the reverse of the wallet?\nIt looks like you can simply add web addresses and apple auto applies a link tag to this but ideally I want to have the link address hidden behind the link title so it doesn't look messy?\n\nA: Since iOS7 you can add hyperlinks to the back of a pass and format the text that is displayed.\nSimply add an <a> tag to the content of a field and the Apple Wallet app will render it as a clickable link. \nFor example: <a href=\"http://www.developer.apple.com\">Click here</a>\nIf you do not use an <a> tag but include a valid URL the Apple Wallet app will display it as clickable address.\n", "Q: Download 'El Capitan', 'Mavericks' or 'Yosemite' from external link The HDD of my MacBook Pro (2012) dies and I bought a new one.

You have to test both in an real world task, in this Case the Game. It will be always a unfair competition. Some points to think about: \nMac OSX and Metal\nSince Apple Introduced Metal it is even harder to compare. In this Case, the game has to use Metal by Apple. If it uses legacy OpenGL, it won't give you a speedup. But if Metal is available and used, the game will run faster than on the same Hardware without Metal.\nMacbook and Bootcamp\nI hade on some Steam Apps with my Macbook with OS-X better FPS than my Colleague (if i remember correctly a Alienware M14x.R2) with the same Graphic-Card as my Macbook Pro Retina 2012. Then i tried it with Bootcamp and i got 5% less FPS in Average case. So Mac OS (and it's Graphics Driver) is more performant in most tasks (even Games) in my case But you can not say it is 5% better in each task/case. \nFPS Comparison\nIs alway bad, every benchmark is a test scenario and not a Real-Event. So the best way to find out is to install the Game on each Notebook and run the same Level with same Settings.

Mission Control changed the idea of spaces from a set number of desktops, to a horizontal line of desktops that can be created and deleted, and full screen apps. As of OSX 10.11, Mission control shows you the expose view of the current desktop, and if you hover over the \"compressed\" desktop bar it will expand to show you the desktops with proper window placement. . \nUsing the 3 finger swipe from side to side while in Mission Control view will show the expose view of the desktop/app you are viewing. \n .

First, my basic question:\nIf I have an iPhone and it is using a local calendar (\"On This Phone\", I think), and my backup is to iCloud, does that backup include the local calendar?\nEdit: to be clear, the backup I'm referring to is:\niCloud.com > Settings > (Advanced section) > Restore Calendars and Reminders\nSecond, and the reason for my question:\nI've performed a series of steps that's left me in a mess with migrating a local calendar to an iCloud calendar whilst also (around the same time) sharing iCloud calendars between two users...\nThe sequence has been something close to this (unfortunately I didn't note them down 100% as I was going):\n\n\n*\n\n*iPhone A and iPhone B, separate Apple IDs, both backing up to iCloud\n\n*iPhone A uses iCloud calendars, only\n\n*iPhone B uses a local calendar, but also has an iCloud calendar containing some events that were invites from iPhone A\n\n*iPhone A shares an iCloud calendar with iPhone B. It all works as expected. The calendar is name \"Calendar\"\n\n*iPhone B considers sharing a calendar with iPhone A, but realises they're using a local calendar, so goes through the process of merging/migrating that local data to be in an iCloud calendar\n\n*(I think, this was achieved by turning on the Calendar option in the iCloud settings, then answering \"yes\" to \"do you want to keep local calendar data?\")\n\n*iPhone B now has iCloud calendars only; the iPhone B user checks on their Mac and they now see the iCloud calendar on their, too. Yay!\n\n*iPhone B now shares their iCloud calendar with iPhone A. The calendar is named \"Calendar\"\n\n*This time, the sharing from iPhone B to iPhone A only kinda works. New events on iPhone B are immediately propagated to iPhone A. However, existing events on iPhone B are not seen on iPhone A (this was not the case when iPhone A was shared to iPhone B)\n\n*Upon seeing this, the users of iPhone A and iPhone B tried things like: un-sharing and re-sharing, re-naming calendars, re-synching... None of which worked.\n\n*Unfortunately, a side effect of the above was that (and I'm not sure at what point it happened) - the existing events on iPhone B became readonly on iPhone B. New events on iPhone B went into the re-named calendar. So, the calendar on iPhone B was renamed from \"Calendar\" to \"Ciara\". Existing events were listed as being under \"Calender\" and new events were listed as being in \"Ciara\"...\n\n*Further un-sharing and showing/hiding calendars resulted in the pre-existing events on iPhone B disappearing completely...\n\n\nNote:\n\n\n*\n\n*Unfortunately, I did not export any of the calendars before doing this (I know, I should have)\n\n\nWhat I've tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*I've tried un-sharing all calendars, then using iCloud.com for iPhone B's account to restore a calendar (only) from before any of the above was started\n\n*It did not work\n\n*However, at the time of that backup, the Calendar option in Settings -> iCloud was turned off. When trying to restore the calendar via iCloud.com, the Calendar option is still turned on\nWhat I'd like to try:\n\n\n*\n\n*Turn that setting off, so iPhone B is not using iCloud calendars\n\n*Restore a calendar backup from iCloud.com\n\n*If it works, and I see the pre-existing events, first do an export, and second try to migrate to iCloud calendars on iPhone B before doing any sharing\n\n\nThe reason for this question:\n\n\n*\n\n*iPhone B belongs to my wife ;)\n\n*I've already lost a whole load of her events; I don't want to mess it up further ;)\n\n*I'll try the above, if I know that the older iCloud calendar backups will have contained the local, calendar data...\n\n\nThanks\n\nA: Following some trial and error, and additional reasoning, I can partially answer my own question:\n(1) The events from a local calendar, on an iPhone (\"On This Phone\", I think it is referred to), are not backed up to the calendar-specfic area in iCloud. Here:\niCloud.com > Settings > (Advanced section) > Restore Calendars and Reminders\nAlthough it doesn't say so explicitly, it makes sense that these iCloud calendar backups cover a user's iCloud calendars. (Plus, my attempt to restore such backups with a hope to see pre-merged, local calendars, failed).\nScreen shot from iCloud.com:\n\n(2) The iPhone backup (the complete backup of the whole phone), which in my case was being backed up to iCloud (rather than iTunes), would, I presume, include the local calendars and their events.\nHowever, by time I'd got to looking at this, my oldest 'complete' iCloud backup was just a day old... which was after I merged the local calendars into iCloud calendars.\n", "Q: Should I trash old CS6 programs before reinstalling CS6 on same disc?

Is it advisable to manually remove and trash these old CS6 program files on SSD (freeing up disc space) before reinstalling from original CS6 DVD?\n\nA: Er... in answer to my own question, I came upon the Creative cloud cleaner tool at https://helpx.adobe.com/creative-cloud/kb/cc-cleaner-tool-installation-problems.html, followed instructions and cleared all old adobe CS applications before reinstalling CS6. \n", "Q: My MacBook Pro makes 3 successive tones, a 5 second pause (repeating) My MacBook Pro makes 3 successive tones, a 5 second pause (repeating).\nAccording to Apple, this indicates RAM does not pass a data integrity check.\nSo how can I fix it?\n\nA: Three beeps on startup is typically a memory self-test error symptom.\nThis article is providing some tools to test your RAM :\nhttp://www.cnet.com/news/troubleshooting-tools-memtest-and-rember/\n", "Q: Hide Mail from showing in Spotlight but keep Messages I want to remove Mail from Spotlight as I don't use it on my Mac.

I am the go-to support for whole lot of iOS devices in my family and have previously used Apple Configurator to apply new settings (such as VPN, email accounts, certificates) to new and existing devices.\nI find this very cumbersome as it requires me to physically connect to each device and add/replace a profile. Therefore I want to replace my current solution and of course I thought of OSX Server (Server.app) first. Unfortunately the only \"stationary computer\" I could run an MDM solution on is a FreeNAS system – only mobile Macs here.\nSo the first question is, whether or not it is advisable to run Server's Profile Manager from a MacBook that is not always used from inside the same network, which has basically been answered as \"not advisable\" by this SX answer.\nFrom that derives the second question: What is the easiest-to-handle MDM solution for managing not hundreds but tens of iOS devices? I figure that most MDM software is highly focused on enterprise-grade device numbers and management necessities. The only features I actually need is pushing profiles containing VPN, Email account and certificate.\n\ntl;dr: What is the easiest-to-handle MDM solution for managing a bunch of iOS devices without using Apple Configurator?\n\nA: Okay by now I figured out a way around the issue. My solution is to rebuild my FreeNAS server into an ESXi Hypervisor, which is capable of running OSX Server in a virtual machine. IMHO that creates quite a big overhead over running an MDM solution from a FreeBSD jail but it gives me a \"native\" Apple MDM, and the added ability to run other OSes in top of the ESXi aswell.\nI see that this is not a generally applicable solution as it requires a server machine capable of running ESXi and a little bit of luck to get OSX to run on virtualized non-Mac hardware. But it works here so I mark this one answered.\n", "Q: Applescript: Automatically check and remount server volume stopped working Yesterday, I found a script that makes my Mac (MacBook Pro running El Capitan) automatically check for a volume on a server and remount it if the connection drops.

Recently, I've had a few scripts that were bugging out for no apparent reason. I made a small change, saved, then undid the change, and saved it again, and the problem went away... Until it came back a week or so later (an old, recurring problem). I'm not entirely certain if that will fix it in your case, but one point of note: You don't need to specify the port number at the end of the domain name or IP address, if the port is the default for the protocol. Port 445 is the default for SMB. You can remove the entire \":445\" part. With unreliable languages, you never know what might fix your issue.\n", "Q: How can I turn off VPN?

I didn't just change the permission, I actually clicked the (-).\n \nI thought it was a hipster nickname for an actual user from the previous owner. Stupid, I know.\nThe problem is that without the start-up wheel, literally every reboot, restart, recover attempt gets hung up at the screen with the Apple and the spinning wheel. The only mode or screens I can access are Single User or Verbose (which can't reboot) because they are the only two that don't run through the traditional start-up path (spinning wheel).\nI've tried every key +power button combo listed anywhere.

After doing this, I noticed that it kept asking me for the iCloud login details for my old Apple ID account. So, I went into iCloud to sign out of the account and sign in with my new one, however since Find my iPad is enabled, it won't sign out of iCloud until that's turned off.\nThe problem is that the email address associated with it:\n\n\n*\n\n*doesn't exist, as I erased it about 6 months ago, and;\n\n*is (obviously) no longer a valid Apple ID account\n\n\nSo there's no way for me to log into my old account so that I can log out of my old account. I can't even add the old email as a secondary to my Apple ID, because it needs to send a verification email, and the address doesn't exist.\nDoes anyone know how to solve this?\n\nA: After spending over an hour and a half to Apple UK's support, and eventually getting transferred to a senior advisor from their US-based support, it turns out that I may have uncovered a bug in iCloud that has since been forwarded to the iCloud Development Team.\nThe old email address had been used as my Apple ID for around 3 years before I changed it. Rather than add an additional one (as I was deleting the old email completely), I change the primary Apple ID; however I neglected to change it for iCloud (I wasn't actually using iCloud for anything, so I didn't think about it). As a consequence, iCloud is still associated with the old Apple ID email, and it wouldn't let me sign out of iCloud unless I signed in with the old Apple ID so I could disable Find my iPad so that I could sign out.\nNow, here's the rub: for whatever reason, Apple have no record of the original Apple ID email. None at all. Normally, as @Tetsujin pointed out in his comment, I should be able to sign in to my Apple ID with my old email even though it's no longer associated with my account, because there should still be a record of it on the system. However, because (for whatever reason) it seems to have been completely purged from Apple's records, there is effectively no way for me to actually sign out of iCloud.\nApple have admitted that this never should have happened, and they have passed the details of the case on to the iCloud Development Team... so I may be indirectly responsible for another iOS9 update. Sorry.\nIn the end, my 'solution' was to abandon the original iPad and set my iPad Mini 4 up as new, manually transferring my apps and settings across, using the old one as a reference.\n", "Q: How to successfully use time machine in MacBook Pro I just heard about time machine, it can uninstall Xcode 7.0.1 for me and give me back Xcode 6.1.

How do I do this?\nTime Machine Q&A\n\nA: The mechanics of Time Machine are pretty simple. I would recommend starting with restoring a folder with two files in it on your desktop to avoid the delays with restoring something like Xcode for your first attempt. Waiting for 5 GB or more to restore or even delete is a poor way to get feedback if you are trying to learn how to use the function.\n\n\n*\n\n*Make your test data and back up manually by adding Time Machine to your menu bar.\n\n*After getting two backups with the folder (name it something searchable like 3821F8D0-E590-4AD5-95A3-7826E1484887 or use uuidgen to make a unique-ish name. Spotlight will help you locate things in Finder as well as in Time Machine\n\n*Delete the original folder off your desktop. (this avoids getting a prompt to replace the folder/file - so once you're ready, you'd delete /Applications/Xcode and then go to your backup to restore it)\n\n*Enter Time Machine and search for the folder name in spotlight.\n\n*Locate the time interval of your choice and select the folder\n\n*Click restore\n\n\nIt will be restored to the original location and you won't be prompted unless there is an existing version of the file/folder. Keep in mind, when you restore a folder on OS X, the behavior is almost always to delete the old folder and everything it contains and then replace it with the copy.\n", "Q: Is it possible to use old Wacom tablet on 10.11? I have Wacom Graphire 3 a.k.a CT-630. This model is old Wacom tablet. So, it has no driver for 10.11.\nCan I use this tablet on my Mac? Any solution?\n\nA: I finally solved this. \nTLDR:\nI managed to get my Wacom Intuos GD-0912-U (first generation Intuos A4 size) tablet working in High Sierra, with a fully functional Wacom Preference Pane, by using a newer driver and preference pane, and hacking the preference pane file: I replaced the Info.plist in the package of the newer preference pane (6.3.15-3) with the Info.plist from the old preference pane (6.2.0w4) that was working in older macOS. Then switched System Preferences to 32bit and back, opening the prefpane before, in between and after. This restores a fully working prefpane.\nExplanation;\nI have an old first Wacom Intuos first generation (GD-0912-U) tablet, and ran into the same problems as described above, after I upgraded to High Sierra from Mountain Lion.\nAfter a lot of reading and trial-and-error, I now have a fully working old Wacom tablet, with a fully working Wacom preference pane in System Preferences.\nI read all solutions in this and other threads.\nFirst, the following steps got me a more or less working tablet, as described in this thread:\n\n\n*\n\n*Using a legacy driver, in my case 6.2.0w4, downloadable on the Wacom website:\nhttp://www.wacom.com/en-gb/support/product-support/drivers\n\n*Export/backup the Wacom preference file from my pre- High Sierra (Mountain Lion in my case) computer/backup with the right settings, with the Wacom Tablet Utility in Applications > Wacom-tablet.\nThen import/restore these setting with the same Wacom Tablet Utility.\nThe above works, you have a working tablet, but without a working Preference pane in System Preferences, as described in this thread.\n\n\n*The solution for a working Preference Pane for previous MacOS versions was to open System preferences in 32-bit mode, as described in this thread.\nUnfortunately this does not work anymore in High Sierra.\n\n\nI managed to get a working Wacom Preference Pane with the following trick/steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the old driver that works. With my Intuos1 tablet, in my case this was version 6.2.0w4\n\n\n*\n\n*Install the driver\n\n*Look up the preference pane file in the Library\nLibray/PreferencePanes/wacomtablet.prefpane\nor it might be here in your User library;\n~/Libray/PreferencePanes/wacomtablet.prefpane\n\n*copy this prefpane file to your Desktop.\n\n\n*Download a newer driver, that does work in High Sierra. In my case this was version: 6.3.15-3:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.wacom.com/en-gb/support/product-support/drivers\n\n*Install this newer driver.\n\n\n*Open the old prefpane wacomtablet.prefpane file that you copied to your Desktop with: right-click > Show Package Contents. Navigate to /contents/Info.plist\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy this file, or keep window open.\n\n\n*Navigate to your the prefpane of the newer driver:\n\n\n*\n\n*Libray/PreferencePanes/wacomtablet.prefpane\nor \n~/Libray/PreferencePanes/wacomtablet.prefpane\n\n*Open it with: right-click > Show Package Contents.\n\n*Navigate to contents/Info.plist\n\n*Replace this Info.plist file with the one from the old preference pane file in step 3.\n\n*Just be sure you keep the newer prefpane file and replace Info.plist with the Info.plist from the old prefpane. You can check versions of the prefpane file with Cmd-i if you get confused.\n\n\n*Restart computer\nThen:\n\n\n*Open System preferences. The Wacom preferences pane now shows and opens, but acts weird.\n\n*Close System preferences. \n\n*Change System preferences to 32-bit mode (with CMD-i on the System preferences app > checkmark at 'open in 32 bit mode').\n\n*Open System preferences\n\n*Make some changes in the Wacom preference pane. The pref pane still acts a little weird at this point.\n\n*Close System preferences.\n\n*Revert the 32-bit mode opening by deselecting the 32 bit mode option.\n\n*Open System preferences and the Wacom preference pane: Voila: fully working preference pane, without any weirdness.\n\n\nSteps 6-13 are crucial, without the 32bit switching and back, the prefpane does not work correctly.\nIn my case with the mentioned to driver versions, I have a fully working prefpane. All options/settings are working and can be saved. Working with my old tablet on High Sierra for a week now, no problems or hickups.\nNotes;\n\n\n*\n\n*I imagine this hack may work for other older driver combinations, but I am not sure, just try it out.\n\n*I read somewhere that next versions of MacOS may not have the 32 bit option anymore, so steps 6-13 may not work anymore after High Sierra. In that case, I imagine that the hacked preference file still may work, but only the future will tell. I am not sure what causes the hacked prefpane only to work correctly after the switch of System Prefs to 32bit and back is performed. Maybe in a new MacOS version, the copied, hacked prefpane will just work. Just be sure to keep a copy of the prefpane and drivers to be safe.\n\n*I got this idea to hack the preference pane here:\nhttps://magicutilities.net/unrelated/75-wacom-preferences-and-os-x\nwhere this fix is described for a Graphire 3 - CTE-430. But without the 32bit System Prefence switch weirdness.\nHope this helps anyone to restore full functionality to our older beloved Wacoms!\n\nA: Just sum up all that been said here and in this thread:\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/6035388?tstart=0\n1.

Maybe this trick will work \nhttp://www.trackpadmagic.com/unrelated/75-wacom-preferences-and-os-x\nFor now I'm happy.. I'll try this preference thing only if I have to.\nEDIT 2020: the trackpadmagic-link is found on waybackmachine - unfortunately no saved drivers from there. https://web.archive.org/web/20160828171735/http://www.trackpadmagic.com/unrelated/75-wacom-preferences-and-os-x \n\nA: I believe that I have the same tablet. I gave it to my niece whose computer was running 10.10.x. I believe that I simply browsed for the most current legacy driver that they was made for it here: http://us.wacom.com/en/support/legacy-drivers\nIf that doesn't work, I would try the next model of tablet after the one you have and its most current driver and keep moving to newer ones util it works.\nI was able to get it working without issue. I'll check which driver I ended up using the next time is visit.\n\nA: To get your tablet running in X.11 go back to the latest system you had your tablet installed and functioning.  In my case it was Mavericks.  \nThere, \n\n\n*\n\n*Configure the tablet settings to your taste.\n\n*Open 'Wacom Tablet Utility' and do a 'Backup...'.  This will generate a file (Preferences.wacomprefs). You can change the name, if you wish, for example: photoshop01.wacomprefs (don't change the extension!)\n\n*Go to EL Capitan, install your tablet with the original driver that came with it, open 'Wacom Tablet Utility' and do a 'Restore' with the preferences file created.\n\n*In my case (Graphite ET, the first model) it works.  If I need to change the functionality of the middle mouse button, I have to go back to Mavericks, change the settings, and repeat the whole process, but at least I have my tablet running.\nHope this helps you,\nR\n\nA: I read the above and tried something else which worked! (intuos3 elecaptian 10.11.4 Mac (24-inch Mid 2007).\nJust choose another usb port! I disconnected intuos from keyboard usb port and reinserted usb lead into back of Imac. I guess it might be about sharing power or not having two input devices on same usb port? Dont know, but it worked for me, good luck to you guys.\n\nA: I have a Wacom Graphire 3 and El Capitan. Out of frustration I went back to my Mac scroll wheel mouse, which I set up with the preference pane that had all the options, scroll wheel, etc. To my surprise, the settings then worked with the Wacom tablet/mouse.  When I disconnected the Mac mouse, the preference pane reverted to the basic one, but the settings remained and I can use the Graphire as I did with Snow Leopard.  To change the settings I just reconnect the Mac mouse.\n\nA: Graphire 4 CTE-640 and El Capitan OSX 10.11 here. I have been trying various solutions online all day but always had one of two errors: either got the \"could not load Wacom Tablet preference pane,\" or got a preference pane that said \"a supported tablet was not found on the system.\" Tried a ton of different things for about the past 4 hours, but finally found a driver that worked for me (btw, i kept getting a 404 error when trying to access the legacy driver linked above, not sure if wacom actually just took it down, or because it's a US site and I'm trying to access it from Japan). Anyway:\n\n\n*\n\n*unplug ur tablet, go to your applications folder and find the Bamboo/Wacom/Tablet folder and run the Bamboo/Wacom/Tablet utility to \"Remove\" \"Tablet Software.\"\n\n*reboot\n\n*download and install \"Driver 5.2.6-5(RC) for OS X 10.8, 10.7, 10.6 & 10.5\" which is named \"PenTablet_5.2.6-5.dmg\"  https://www.wacom.asia/en/driver-526-5rc-for-os-x-107-106-105\n\n*plug in your tablet, open the preferences and enjoy!\nThis should work for Bamboo, Bamboo Comic,Bamboo Craft Pen & Touch, Bamboo Fun Pen & Touch, Bamboo Manga, Bamboo One, Bamboo Pen, Bamboo Pen & Touch, Cintiq 17SX, DTF-510, DTF-720 / PL-720, DTU-710, Graphire Bluetooth, Graphire3, and Graphire4. I hope this works for you so you can celebrate as I just did; and you can be sure that I'm saving the dmg to avoid this frustration in the future. \n\nA: The only way I got my old Wacom working on Yosemite or el Capitan is to configure settings in snow leopard (good old) and then copy settings from library/launchagents to new system. Find no way to manage settings in the new system.\n\nA: I have a Bamboo CTH470 and it suddenly didn't work anymore in EL Capitain. So I installed the latest driver available... it said my tablet was not supported. So I installed on top the lastest available version for my tablet... and it worked as far I can use it as a mouse again (my main use). I didn't test other functions but it might work.\n\nA: I was having the same issues trying to get my Intuos 2 working (I love this thing have had it for at least 10 years) and when I installed a fresh copy of El Capitan the preferences didn't work.\nI do have a backup hard drive with my previous OS on there in which the Wacom preferences do still work.\nIf anyone is in desperate needs and has a large Intous 2 (10x12 or whatever the large size was at the time) I might be able to send you a custom Intous 2 preference file that was loaded easily into the Wacom utility in El Capitan.\nBut if you do have a backup restore drive you can boot that and save the preferences in the Wacom utility (not the Wacom preferences, just search for Wacom utility that is the only option that works on El Capitan as well).\n\nA: I just downloaded the latest legacy driver from http://www.wacom.com/en-us/support/faqs/legacy-tablet-driver-pages/what-is-the-latest-driver-for-the-intuos-gd-tablets and my Intuos 2 is working pretty well with El Capitan. True - I can't load the preference pane but can't say I need to. \n\nA: There is a way to use the legacy preference pane in El Capitan.\nI am using a Wacom Intuos 2 6x8 (Model XD–0608-U) tablet with Mac OS X El Capitan 10.11.4.\nAfter finding this page on Wacom's web site: http://www.wacom.com/en-us/support/faqs/legacy-tablet-driver-pages/what-is-the-lates-driver-for-the-intuos-2-xd-tablets I downloaded and installed the legacy driver.\nWhen I try to open the preference pane normally, I get the message: \"Could not load Wacom Tablet preference pane.\"\nIn order to access the preference pane, System Preferences needs to be opened in 32-bit mode.\nFind System Preferences in your Applications folder. Highlight it and press cmd-I (Get Info) to get the Information box. Tick ‘Open in 32-bit mode’ (and low resolution if you have a retina display). Now you can open the Wacom Tablet preference panel in System Preferences. Set up your tablet. Then cmd-I again on System Preferences and turn off 32 bit mode.\nAnytime you need to adjust preferences for the tablet, remember to switch System Prefs into 32-bit mode.\n\nA: This is how it will work for Wacom Intuos 2 on El Capitan Mac OS X 10.11:\n\n\n*\n\n*Uninstall any Wacom driver with the Wacom tool.\n\n*Install this.\n\n*Install this Wacom driver.\n\n\nThis is the only way I get it to work for me.\n\nA: I have very old Intuos GD-0192-U graphics tablet. It's huge, but I'm used to it and don't want to buy a new one. \nI upgraded to El Capitan from Yosemite and this is the only driver that works for me: WacomTablet_615-2.dmg if you can find it. (It also got me from Maverick to Yosemite). The current one (615-3) did not work. Luckily I always archive any .dmg file that works just in case. \n\nA: I have an ancient Intuos GD-0608-U and I got it to work with El Capitan by installing this driver from Wacom:\nhttp://cdn.wacom.com/U/drivers/mac/pro/WacomTablet_6.2.0w4.dmg\nAs the previous user stated the preferences don't work but the pen/stylus does work with default settings...\n\nA: The Asian site worked for me. They had the driver for my Intous 3 Wacom Tablet. I  downloaded, did a restart and VOILA! I'm running 10.11.6 on a 2007 iMac (20 inch)\n\nA: For my GD-0608-U, I tested this \"fixed driver\"\non macOS Monterey 12.6.1, Wacom driver 6.3.44-2 (oldest for Monterey).\nSet System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy > Accessibility and Input Monitor.\nHope this help.\n\nA: For the Graphire 2 tablet I needed to get 2011 drivers and open the system preferences in 32bit mode. I did not need to reboot after installing.\n\nA: I posted an answer here for my Intuos first generation and High Sierra. But this probably does not work with Mojave or even Catalina. \nToday I found this app 'Connect my tablet' that should work to connect older Wacom tablets to High Sierra, Mojave and Catalina. I did not test it yet, have to upgrade first, but I post this here in the hope it helps fellow users with old Wacom tablets wanting to get most functionality back in Mojave or Catalina.\nhttps://wptrnpt.co.uk/wp/connect-my-tablet/\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352696344\n", "Q: How to stop my SSD \"ejecting\" from my iMac when in standby? I recently purchased an SSD drive for my 2009 27\" iMac to replace the DVD Drive.\nEverything installed fine, performance is good etc. However when the device (SSD) is put to \"sleep\", OS X sees it as ejected, and will not see it again until I pull the power from the iMac.

Additionally, surely it's going to go to sleep when it goes to standby for the whole Mac.\nAny suggestions/Thoughts?\n\nA: have a look at:\nhttp://www.mac-forums.com/apple-notebooks/273332-2nd-internal-hard-drive-ejects-sleep.html\nIt seems to be the caddy.\n", "Q: Charging an iPhone from a closed MacBook I always thought you couldn't charge an iPhone from a closed macbook without opening it first, and then closing it after plugging the iPhone in. However today my phone was completely dead and I was on a train unable to take my laptop out and open it even a little bit.\nthe phone charged while it was dead, and when it turned on it was on 2%, however it didn't stay charging, instead 5 minutes later it died again, and starting charging while dead again. \nIs there a way to keep the phone charging after it turns on from dead? (without opening the macbook, it seems like it's the phones fault it stops charging as that's the only thing that doesn't change, and it's jailbroken so I can install tweaks)\n\nA: You would want to enable closed clamshell mode (search Apple.com/support) for the details on what is required on which models:\n\n\n*\n\n*Attached external display\n\n*Connected USB device like keyboard or mouse \n\n*Connected to power charger and not running on battery\n\n\nAt this point, you'll get the normal USB charging or the enhanced charge if the hardware detects your iOS device as benefitting from the capabilities of the hardware to charge at a higher rate than 500mA.\nIf you cannot run in closed clamshell mode, set the sleep to be long enough to get a charge and prevent the lid from closing completely. Setting up power nap will also allow brief moments of charge, but that isn't intended to get a realistic charge over USB.\n\nA: A solution that I can think of is to turn of sleep before you close the lid of your MacBook. This will keep your laptop running until the battery for it dies.\nOne tool for doing this is the InsomniaX.\nStep by step:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install InsomniaX\n\n*Choose \"Disable Lid Sleep\"\n\n*Close the lid\n\n*Connect your iPhone to USB\n\n\nNote: InsomniaX has a CPU Safety function that should keep the computer \"cool\". Still it is expected that the computer could get much warmer than average. You should test to see if your hardware get to hot if you put it in a bag.

That will work. \nIf it's too big to email, use a cloud service (Dropbox, Google Drive, etc.) and email them the link.\nEven if it's not too big for an attachment, you might consider sending them a link so they can download at their convenience, rather than having you 'push' the file into their inbox.\n", "Q: Accidentally deleted files using GNU find -delete - how to recover? I was playing around with OSX find and GNU find from findutils (v 4.4.2) package for learning purposes. GNU find has a -delete option, which is self-explanatory. What isn't, however, is that \"Use of -delete automatically turns on the -depth option\", which means it will recursively remove the current working directory content without a warning.\nThe problem is I accidentally executed such a command on my system, instead of remote shell session.\nI tried to research the internals behind -delete but all I could come up with was official GNU findutils docs.\nAs I realised what happened, I turned off the system to prevent possible overwriting of sectors. Then, I took a \"standard recovery approach\" using\n\n\n*\n\n*EaseUS Data Recovery Wizard for Mac\n\n*Prosoft Data Rescue 3\n\n*Disk Drill\n\n*Mac Data Recovery Guru\n\n\nbut to no results. The removed directory was actually a git repository with many small files. As close-to-zero disk operation was made since the deletion, I doubt all of them could get overwritten. It's not a disastrous situation because I'm obviously pull the repository content from remote. Still, I loose unpublished local branches and files under .gitignore.\nAre there any OSX mechanisms I could use to get these files back?\n\nA: OS X maintains deleted files in the local time machine storage area if you have enabled (or the system has enabled) a local store.\ntmutil snapshot\n\nIf you can make a snapshot, you can enter Time Machine and recover these files. If you get an error like **Local snapshots are not enabled.\n** then you don't have the ability to recover the files from the OS level. Since there is no other undelete mechanism in the filesystem, you have a good survey of recovery tools (I use Data Rescue pretty much exclusively) and your only third option would be to locate a viable backup of the system or the files in question.\nI make a habit of enabling the local store and forcing a snapshot before doing anything as root or anything I might regret from the terminal. Having made mistakes like this over the years, I've learned to have that \"premonition\" to check backup and double check the syntax. In general, I try to make a list of files to delete and save it to a file so I have a pause and a second script that does the removal rather than piping them together. It's not going to help, but it's my experience and way to mitigate when I can't ensure a good backup.\nsudo tmutil enablelocal\nsleep 8 && tmutil snapshot\n\n", "Q: MacOS El Capitan icon change I having a big question with some icons i change. I managed to move into rootless by restarting and CMD + R to boot into Recovery, then utilities and terminal.

It then corrupted, so I was forced to delete the partition and attempt to reinstall windows 7, but in the process  I also deleted my OS X partition. Now after spending hours and countless DVD+Rs on creating OS X and Linux boot discs (all of which fail to open anything but BIOS), I am still left with a shell of a computer with no OS.\nHow can I reinstall OS X/Ubuntu.\n\nA: Start Recovery Mode (CMD+R) at boot. \nEven if your OS X partition is gone, you should have options to recover/reinstall OS X.\nHave a look at: OS X: About OS X Recovery\n\nA: I'm not absolutely certain, but I doubt that machine can use Internet Recovery, it's too early.\nSee the list at https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202313 for those that can be firmware upgraded to use it.\nWorst case scenario, if you can't find the disks the machine came with might be to get hold of a retail version of Snow Leopard & once that's successfully installed, you can then upgrade to any previously purchased OS, or jump right to El Capitan, from the App Store.\n", "Q: Trouble using Time Machine with SMB share in OSX El Capitan I'm having problems using and SMB share in my local network as a time machine destination.\nI followed the tutorials widely available on the internet but in the end when I open the Time Machine app I get the error message:\n\nCan't connect to a current Time Machine backup disk\n\nI followed these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Created the sparse bundle\n\n*Copied the sparse bundle to the smb share\n\n*Double clicked in the sparse bundle to mount it\n\n*Enabled ownership on the mounted sparse bundle\n\n*Used tmutil to set the Time Machine destination as the mounted sparse bundle\n\n*Opened Time Machine app.\n\n\nI find this strange because I can perfectly access the sparse bundle via Finder or the terminal, and have write access:\n\n\nI can't really find anything in the logs in the Console app to determine what is in fact the connection trouble. Can someone please guide me to the answer?\nI'm using OSX 10.11 El Capitan.\nThanks\n\nA: This is going to be a throughly unsatisfying answer, but it comes down to the fact that random network drives were not meant to be used as time machine backup targets.\nI'd wager one of the things you did in your guide was to run a terminal command along the lines of:\ndefaults write com.apple.systempreferences TMShowUnsupportedNetworkVolumes 1\n\nUnsupported being the watchword here.\nI've run into this exact problem myself, but only when backing up to network shares.\nUsually what it takes to break Time Machine out of its funk is to completely disable it (toggling the switch to off in the preferences pane), unmount your network share, remount it, and then re-enable time machine. The system is smart enough to see that you already have backups in the bundle file and you won't lose any data.\nStill - you're playing with your safety net. If the contents of your machine are super important, please pick up a time capsule so you don't wind up with a nasty surprise some day.\nI've no idea what triggers this behavior - it appears to be completely random.\n\nA: In case you haven't found a solution yet, in the guide I was following it never mentioned to run the tmutil utility to set the backup drive via  command shell, so just run the following command on a Terminal and you will have the disk selected on Time Machine Preferences:\nsudo tmutil -a setdestination \"/Volumes/Time Machine Backups/\"\n\nRemember to change the name of the volume, in my case as I used makeImage.sh it defaults to \"Time Machine Backups\"\n\nA: In my case the below code worked.

Now your keystrokes will go into the virtual machine.\n  \n*Quickly, before the Apple logo appears, press and hold the Command  ⌘ key and the R key together.\n  \n*Once you see the Apple logo appear, release the keys.\n  \n  \n  If you completed steps 1 through 3 quickly enough, the virtual machine will boot into the Recovery Environment.\n\n\nA: This option is valid for vCenter, not sure about Workstation.\nYou might have a machine that boots very fast and are unable to hit keys in time.\nClick on VM and select tab Summary and then under VM Hardware ->\nEdit Settings: VM Options: Boot Options: Boot Delay\nEnter 5000 as milliseconds ( 5 seconds ).\nRestore settings when done to avoid unnecessary boot delay in future.\n\nA: I take a hint from a comment in this blog post and realize that disabling SIP in guest VM is actually simple.\n\n\n*\n\n*In VMWare boot screen, click F12 to enter BIOS setup\n\n*Select Boot Maintenance Manager > Boot From File\n\n*Select the recovery HD and pick the right efi\n\n*After booting into recovery mode, start Terminal\n\n*Execute csrutil disable\n\nA: I know this is an older question but I came across it looking for a solution to this problem so I figured I would submit an answer that contains all of the info I came across in one place.\nBackground\nMy environment\nHost\n\n*\n\n*Windows 10\n\n*VMWare Workstation 12 (patched to run macOS)\n\nGuest\n\n*\n\n*macOS High Sierra 10.13.4\n\nI originally tried adding macosguest.forceRecoveryModeInstall = \"TRUE\" to my .vmx config. This allowed me to boot into recovery and could disable SIP but then I couldn't get the VM to boot normally, even after removing that line.\nThe solution to this problem I found was to just delete the .nvram file. Unfortunately, that's where the flag to disable SIP is stored so when my VM came back up SIP was enabled again.\nMy Solution\n\n*\n\n*From the Terminal, run the following commands (thanks to G5tube for this suggestion)\n sudo nvram \"recovery-boot-mode=unused\"\n sudo reboot recovery\n\nThe second command will reboot your Mac instantly, so better save any unfinished work first.\n\n\n*Once the Mac has rebooted into the Recovery / Installer system (you may have to choose your language first): From the menu bar, click Utilities > Terminal\n\n\n*Run csrutil disable from the terminal, followed by reboot\n\n\n*Once your VM has rebooted normally you can verify that SIP was disabled by opening a terminal and running csrutil status\nTo turn SIP back on, follow the same steps as above but run csrutil enable at the recovery terminal instead.\n\nA: What worked for me was:\n\n*\n\n*Connect the Monterey ISO image I used to install Monterey in the VM in the first place.\n\n*Boot to firmware.\n\n*Boot using the ISO image, which took me to the recovery/install screen.\n\n*Launch to Terminal and run csrutil disable.\n\n*Restart.\n\n\nA: The simple solution is clicking on boot in the centre of vmware window then holding Windows key+R for few second and there will appear the apple logo and after few seconds the recovery mode. When done restart OS X.\n\nA: VMware Workstation 12 on Windows 10.\nThe steps does work. It will boot into a window that let u reinstall the OS, disk utilities, and two other options (I can' remember).\nThen above you will see \"Window\" click it and you will see a drop down that allow access to terminal.\nthen type:\ncsrutil disable\n\nRestart the VM. \n\nA: I was able to get this working on my Windows VMware install after many tries. (And yes I know I'm not supposed to do that, but I'm also not supposed to drive over 55 MPH either).  In hindsight, my mistakes were either not using the correct key combo, or not holding it long enough.\nI had to edit the VM config file (.vmx, in the virtual machine folder) to add the 5 second delay.  Then the correct key combo on a Windows keyboard was Windows-R, and I had to press that once and hold it for the 10 seconds or so until the apple logo appeared.  Then it went through what seemed to be the normal boot sequence, but at the end put me into recovery mode where I could bring up a terminal window, and type\ncsrutil disable\n\nFinally, exactly what I needed to get my screen resolution back!\n", "Q: Can apps access my camera without telling me? Suppose I give an app permission to access my camera (and/or microphone) to take a picture.  After I take the picture, can the app access my camera without prompting me?\nI thought of this while using the Facebook messenger app.  The app allows you to take pictures and send them directly into your Facebook messages. Can the app also \"look\" through my camera while I am scrolling through contacts (or doing anything else unrelated to photos)?\nApologies if this has already been answered.\n\nA: This question over on StackExchange lead me to Apple's iOS Developer Guide, specifically, the background section. This lists the activities apps are aloud to run in the background, camera access is not one of them. \nThis would also be a terrible condition for battery life and so it is not surprising that it is not supported. While this doesn't guarantee that none of your apps will try to get access to your camera, you can rest assured that if anyone tried to, Apple would reject their app. \nThis also ensures that there's no API for background camera access, so unless someone has figured out a way to hack non-jail broken iOS at a very low level, we can all sleep safely with only the watchful eye of Siri upon us. \nEdit:\nPer my discussion with timothymh below, I realized you may have been asking about if you are still using a given app, having take a picture without switching to a new app. With more interesting reading from Apple's Developer Guide, we find that the camera API won't hand you data until a picture is taken or a video completed. Because the camera isn't handled by a daemon, it would be very difficult to be constantly polling the camera for input, even if you found a way past the API to get data without user input. Note I'm not an Apple developer, but from an official standpoint, it appears what you're talking about shouldn't be possible. \n\nA: I think the answer is yes, it can. But it is unlikely to happen.\nTo take an image you can use the class UIImagePickerController, which inherits from UINavigationController and UIViewController. On top of that view you can put another view by accessing the property cameraOverlayView.\nBut there is another option, the AVFoundation, that does not require any output at all. And there is no feedback for the user if the developer does not want to.\n", "Q: Problems installing OSX on SSD I've tried four different SSDs over the last few months, on two separate Macs, and have been unsuccessful in getting OS X installed on any of them.

Summary\nSince upgrading to El Capitan from Yosemite, Time Machine works manually, but automated backups and disk icons are no longer working as they should.\nDetailed Problem Description\nI have a brand-new system that came with Yosemite, and Time Machine was working fine. After a recent upgrade to El Capitan, I have the following issues:\n\n\n*\n\n*The Time Machine disk (an external USB 3.0 device) no longer shows up on the desktop as a Time Machine device. It shows as a standard removable disk.\n\n\n*Even though Time Machine sees the device and schedules periodic backups, these backups never run. The only backups that run are the first one scheduled when the Time Machine disk is mounted, or when \"Back Up Now\" is selected. In this example, the manual backup I ran at 4:00pm completed, but the incremental scheduled for 4:59pm never ran.\n\nTroubleshooting Steps\nOn my own, and with Apple technical support, I did all of the following in an attempt to debug:\n\n\n*\n\n*Sensible things I tried on my own:\n\n\n*\n\n*Perform First Aid on the Time Machine GUID table.\n\n*Perform First Aid on the Mac OS Extended (Journaled, Encrypted) filesystem on the disk. \n\n*Unmount and remount the Time Machine disk.\n\n*Deselect and reselect the Time Machine disk.\n\n*Disable Time Machine, reboot, and reselect the Time Machine Disk.\n\n\n*Things I did at the request of tech support:\n\n\n*\n\n*PRAM reset.\n\n*SMC reset.\n\n*Boot in Safe Mode.\n\n*Configure Time Machine as a different Administrator account.\n\n*Boot to recovery partition and non-destructively reinstall OS X.\n\n\n\nOther than performing a full erase and reinstall, I'm at a loss as to how to troubleshoot this issue further. This seems to be a bug in El Capitan, but of course there's always the possibility that some kernel extension or third-party extension like FUSE, VirtualBox, or VMWare Fusion is wrecking havoc, but I require those extensions for work.\nApple currently denies that there are any outstanding Time Machine bugs in El Capitan, but that may be due to its newness or the fact that not enough people have reported related issues yet. On the other hand, if it's really just my problem, what else can I do to debug this or work around this (e.g. a cronjob of some kind, perhaps?) short of hosing my entire system and starting from scratch?\n\nA: I'm having a very similar problem after upgrading to El Capitan, except that I can not repair the disk, my attempt always gives me a repair failed error.  I don't have an answer, but I think I can verify that the issue probably isn't related to any third-party extensions as I'm operating without.  So at least I may be able to help rule out those as a source of the problem.\n\nA: Apple's engineers will need you to run tmdiagnose to get at the root cause. In the mean time, you could gather those logs and also try to push at the status:\ntmutil latestbackup\ntmutil listbackups\ntmutil startbackup --rotation --auto\nsleep 15; tmutil status\n\nMy guess is you have a spotlight issue or an issue mounting the drive that's failing as opposed to launchd falling down. You could make a cron entry, but I'd use a tool like Lingon to make a custom launchd job to call the startbackup command from above to at least have some periodic coverage while you gather enough information to figure out why your jobs are not starting.\nAlso, I would try adding a second backup destination to see if that one works more reliably - multiple backup destinations should fire sequentially - every n hours, your one drive should get a snapshot.\n\nA: I do not think it is just \"your problem.\" I have a late 2013 MacBook Pro and have been unable to complete a Time Machine backup with my WD My Passport since I upgraded to El Capitan. I tried all the potential fixes you did. I also reindexed my hard drive and erased my backup drive and started fresh. \nThe problem persists. Namely that when I initiate a Time Machine backup the process stalls permanently about two thirds to completion each attempt.\n\nA: TL; DR\nThis problem of backups not starting can be worked around with crontab. This won't fix the desktop icon, but will help ensure that you have backups at regularly-scheduled intervals as defined in your custom crontab. Below, I provide an example of how to run hourly backups using sudo, cron, and a modified sudoers file\nWork-Around Using Crontab\nThe following will kick off Time Machine hourly, after checking to make  sure it isn't already running a backup as some media or backup sets may take more than an hour to complete.\n# ~/.crontab\n0 */1 * * * tmutil status | grep -qF \"Running = 0\" && sudo tmutil startbackup -a\n\nNote that this work-around uses the user's crontab, which always needs to be brought to the system's attention after editing with:\n/usr/bin/crontab ~/.crontab\n\nRun Time Machine without Passwords\nSince cron can't prompt for the sudo password, the following is also recommended:\nsudo -v\nsudo mkdir -p /private/etc/sudoers.d\nsudo touch /private/etc/sudoers.d/$(whoami)\necho \"$(whoami) ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/tmutil\" |\n    sudo tee -a /private/etc/sudoers.d/$(whoami)\n\nThis will ensure that the tmutil command can be run without prompting for the user's password for sudo access when launching Time Machine from the command line.\nSafety Note\nIt's always a good idea to have a root terminal open before editing sudoers, and to verify the custom sudoers file with:\nsudo visudo -f /private/etc/sudoers.d/$(whoami)\n\nafter creation to prevent typos from locking you out of sudo access.\n", "Q: How do I remove contacts on my sim card on iPhone? By accident I imported some contacts to my contacts app in my iPhone. I do not need them there. So, If I need to avoid to import them again  by accident I would like to remove them from my sim.

Apple is unlikely to pro-actively thin apps already installed on iOS devices.\nThe roll out may also be slowed by bugs and lack of developer support. For example in iOS 9.0, Apple disabled App Slicing due to a bug:\n\nApp Slicing Currently Unavailable\nSeptember 24, 2015\nApp slicing is currently unavailable for iOS 9 apps due to an issue affecting iCloud backups created from iOS 9 where some apps from the App Store would only restore to the same model of iOS device.\nWhen a customer downloads your iOS 9 app, they will get the Universal version of your app, rather than the variant specific for their device type.

Every time when opening an new Terminal window, the View -> Allow mouse reporting is always checked.

Sometimes keeping a low CPU program running like stopwatch or count down timer can let the background process that updates spotlight get enough CPU time with the device awake to complete the indexing.\n\n*Uninstall the app and reinstall it.\n\n*Open a support request and they can gather diagnostic logs to determine why your spotlight database isn't updating.\n\n", "Q: Copy a file's NSURL to clipboard I am trying to do a rather simple thing: in the context menu I want to have an action (e.g. with Automator) that gets and copies the file's NSURL to clipboard.\nThe solution seems simple, but it does not work (some unspecific error).\nHere is what I have so far:\non run {input, parameters}\n\n   set p to POSIX path of (input)\n   set nsu to current application's |NSURL|'s fileURLWithPath:p\n\n   return nsu\n\nend run\n\nI am looking to get the file reference URL, like so: file:///.file/id=6571367.2773272/\nI am on El Capitan.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: Here is the solution to the issue (from: http://macscripter.net/viewtopic.php?pid=183164#p183164):\nuse framework \"Foundation\"\n\non run {input, parameters}\n\n    set p to POSIX path of (input)\n    set nsu to current application's |NSURL|'s fileURLWithPath:p\n\n    set fru to nsu's fileReferenceURL()'s absoluteString() as text\n\n    return fru\n\nend run\n\nI did not check jweak's answer.

Under the 'Choose Storage' section on Apple's iMac configuration page there is a blue link titled 'How much storage is right for you? (Choose Storage)\n'. In that dialog it says:\n\nFor the best performance, iMac systems with 32GB of memory should be\n  configured with a 2TB or larger Fusion Drive or all flash storage.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/imac?product=MK472LL/A&step=config#\nWhy would Apple a 2TB or larger Fusion Drive or all flash storage for iMac systems with 32GB of memory? Is it related to the size of the sleep image since 1TB Fusion Drives only come with 24GB of flash?\n\nA: The second part of that statement \"or all flash storage\" is universally true. Solid state storage that ships with the current (2015) lineup of hardware is almost an order of magnitude faster than HDD technology. If you can make a justification that the increased performance is worth the uncharge then a pure SSD storage chain is a first choice/no brainer solution.\nAs for the 1 TB vs 2 TB fusion drive - there could be two items in play:\n\n\n*\n\n*If the SSD component of the Fusion Drive is manufactured as faster than the 1 TB version, that would be a clear win. The page lists the 1 TB flash component as 24 GB of fast flash. The 2 TB drive contains 128GB of fast flash which is 5 times the space for fast file storage.\n\n*Just common sense. Internal iMac storage is not user serviceable so if you know you are a power user and need 32 GB of RAM, you likely won't mind the incremental cost of SSD or larger fusion drive and would statistically be someone that would want more storage in a year according to Apple's marketing research and experience.\n\n\nI wouldn't think the sleep image usage would matter on 10.10 or 10.11 for several reasons:\n\n\n*\n\n*The image is not purely based on the size of total RAM. The OS thins the sleep image through memory compression and other virtual memory enhancements.\n\n*Writing a sleep image file is a large sequential write, which is the one benchmark where a traditional HDD performs quite well as compared to SSD since the drive cache and firmware to write a large chunk of contiguous storage to a spinning drive is quite optimized. SSD really shines for random small IO where the HDD seek times and latency causes large slowdowns.\n\n", "Q: How to disable spotlight for Alfred El Captain I have asked this question last year. In the link below. \nHow to disable spotlight for Alfred\nBut, since the settings now changed in El Captain the answer is not valid now. Please re-answer. I don't want to stop indexing. I just to disable spotlight and assign cmd+space to Alfred. \n\nA: The answer is almost the same as the previous answer you linked.\nDisable ⌘Space for Spotlight:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to System Preferences > Spotlight.\n\n*In the lower left, click the button Keyboard Shortcuts... (this is the part that changed in El Capitan).\n\n*Now in the keyboard shortcuts menu, deselect Show Spotlight Search.\n\n\n\nNote that this does not disable Spotlight.

Tried following some other site's suggestions but nothing has resolved the problem, so now what should I do? Keys worked before the install.\nMacBook Pro (Retina, early 2105)\n2.7 GHz\n8 GB\n\nA: What happened here is that your FN key settings got reverted - there's an option that the F-keys either transmit their assigned key (so F10 means F10), or the additional function (so F10 means mute).\nNormally, this is set to function mode, so F10 means mute. You can change this in your Keyboard settings in system preferences.\n\nIf the \"Use as standard function keys\" option is turned on, you will need to hit Fn to access the mute key. If it's turned off, you will not need to hit Fn, but if you want to send an actual F10, then you need to hold Fn.\n\nA: AUDIO KEYS WERE NOT ADJUSTING VOLUME ON MY IMAC AFTER UPGRADE TO EL CAPITAN All I did was go into System Preferences > keyboard and then uncheck (turn off)   \"use all F1, F2 etc. keys as standard function keys\"     and my apple wireless keyboard worked fine. I was able to adjust volumes audio with the keys and increase or decrease brightness on my computer. The F keys are finally working! \nI have a iMac (27-inch, Mid 2010) with SSD drive, apple wireless keyboard and El Capitan 10.11.4  \nNOTE: I was on phone with apple support and they told me first to unplug machine, wait then replug and restart (didn't work), they then told me I would have to bring in the keyboard or mac because it is no longer on warranty and it could be a hardware issue. I disagreed. So they then had me restart with the SHIFT key, (didn't work), then they had me reset the P ramp (didn't work) they then told me to reinstall my operating system. (didn't work) So I decided to look online and try the best source. This was the first one I came to. I didn't have to follow the above directions completely, for me all I did was uncheck the first check box as mentioned above and all the keys worked!!!! Wow, and apple doesnt know this yet?  Hope others find this helpful. \n\nA: For me the solution was to reset the SMC.\n\nA: First, Apple Tech Support is useless for this issue. After managing to insert a latte into my mid-2009 Apple extended keyboard I had to replace it. I never had an issue with the original keyboard & El Capitan, but the new one (Apple) produced non-functioning \"Function\" keys. After rebooting, safe-booting, resetting PRAM, etc. with no improvement I \"deselected\" the \"Function Keys\" box within \"Preferences\". I suspect that somewhere along the line Apple has made an internal change to the keyboard since my earlier one worked fine.\n", "Q: MacBook USB Hub with mini displayports I have the new 2015 MacBook. I am trying to find a HUB (or Docking Station) can can allow me to hook up two 4K Displays while supplying power to the MacBook.\nI don't care if it uses HDMI or mini Display but my searches on the Internet tend to show mini Display is the way to go for 4K display.\nI was a backer for HUB+. The HUB+ has been cancelled in their latest update.\nBut there are other projects available like HydraDock, Pluggable and OWC USB-C\nAside from Plugable's Unfunded Kickstarter Campaign, I don't see any solution to have 2 4K displays at the same time.\n\nFrom Pluggable's web site\n\nThe Plugable Ultimate Dock utilizes two unique yet complimentary\n  technologies:\nUSB 3.1 Type-C supports a feature called “VESA Alternate Mode” which\n  works with the built-in graphics processor on supported systems to\n  provide video output at resolutions up to 4K. The other two display\n  outputs in the Ultimate Dock are enabled by the DisplayLink DL-3900\n  graphics processor, which can support two additional 1080P displays at\n  60Hz.\n\nTheir Kickstarter failed so I am not sure if they will ever manufacture this item. I assumed OWC is doing the same thing or something similar to drive the displays.\n\nA: USB doesn't have direct access to a GPU. Driving two 4K displays would be quite difficult, if at all possible. In all honesty, if you wanted to drive two 4K displays, the new MacBook was NOT the computer you should have purchased. It can barely handle its own display.\n", "Q: Run Automator workflow or shell script at application launch/shutdown As the title says, I'm looking for a way to run an Automator workflow (or a shell script) when I launch a specific application. When I shut down the application, I want to run another workflow/shell script. How do I achieve this? \nAny help is much appreciated!\n\nA: To keep tracking if an app is running you need to use a background loop. I don't know if there is another method but this will work, although it will eat a little bit of your memory. The loop will keep waiting until you open the application, and then it will wait for you to quit.\nSave your workflow as an application and set it to run on startup. As your first action run an Applescript like this:\n\n\nrepeat until application \"TextEdit\" is running -- change for the app you want\n    delay 1 -- it will check every one second for the app\nend repeat\ndelay 3 -- you can change this value if the app will take some time to get ready\nif application \"TextEdit\" is running then \n    -- Your code for starting here\nend if\n\n\nyou can set other actions after this or just use applescript.\nAt the end of the workflow place another action running Applescript:\n\n\nrepeat until application \"TextEdit\" is not running -- change here too\n    delay 1 -- it will check every one second if the app is gone\nend repeat\ndelay 3 -- you can change this value if the app will take some time to vanish\nif application \"TextEdit\" is not running then \n    -- Your code for quitting here\nend if\n\n\nAgain you can set other actions below.\nLet me know if you have specific goals and we can work to improve this workflow.\n", "Q: Can this model of MacBook Pro satisfy my scientific needs? I've recently decided to buy a 13-inch MacBook Pro. Although this costs me a lot, first-time experiencing this machine could be very interesting for me. Its weight is the other reason that attracts me. However, I'm a little bit afraid of buying this machine. \nOne reason is its specs. I work with Python and Matlab in my daily work. My programming work is not very intensive and most of the time deals with satellite image processing. I also work with some satellite-image-processing pieces of software, such as ENVI, PCI Geomatica, etc. I don't know how much this laptop is powerful, especially its integrated GPU, to run these apps on Mac.\nThe other reason that causes me to not think of buying this laptop is its overheating problem. I saw some complaints about the overheating and annoying warmness on the right side of the laptop. Moreover, when it comes to intensive computing, this problem could be become more severe. \nWith regard to to the above descriptions, do you think buying this laptop can be suitable for me? \nI have to add that my current Lenovo laptop has a core i5 CPU and a GT 720m GPU and so far I have had not any serious problem with it for my scientific work.\n\nA: It is impossible to determine if the laptop you described would be suitable, because you have not described it. Apple has been releasing 13 inch MacBook Pro laptops since 2008.\nMatlab seems to have had performance issues on Mac OS X, I'm not sure if this is still a problem, but you should try to find out, a good place to start is the official minimum requirements of Matlab for Mac OS X: http://www.mathworks.com/support/sysreq/current_release/index.html?sec=mac\nPython would probably work fine, however not much can be said about the rest of the software you use, because you did not mention what that software is. First of all, make sure all of your software also runs on Mac OS X or if there are alternatives for Mac OS X that you could use.\n", "Q: Is there a way that I can set the iOS music app to save my progress during playback? I've noticed since updating to iOS 9 that if I pause music playback in the middle of a song, then return to the music app after a period of time, the song begins playing again from the beginning. Not where I left off. This can get annoying if you are listening to a longer file, like a mix or (I would imagine) an audiobook. Is there a way for me to change the setting so that my position within the song will be remembered?\n\nA: If you set the media type to audiobook or podcast it will give you the option to remember playback position, but it will be moved to the iBooks or Podcast app instead of being able to be played in Music. \n", "Q: Apple Mail in El Capitan I have not found a way to get Apple Mail to work in El Captain.  I removed Spam Sieve, MsgFiler, Mail Act-On, and followed other suggestions to no avail.\n\nA: Had a similar problem solved by closing Mail, deleting all e-mail accounts in System Preferences, reinstalling my iCloud e-mail account from scratch - iCloud Mail then OK -  after which I then added my other e-mail accounts - all now OK.

After updating to OS X El Capitan 10.11 and updating to Xcode 7.0.1 I ran into some issues with the simulator. \nAt first the simulator would launch but I couldn't register/log in to the app because the ATS Key was needed. That was added, but now there is a different issue.\nWhenever I try to launch the simulator, it appears in my dock, but it's inactive. It doesn't ever actually open and if I click on it's options, it shows that he simulator is not responding. \nIt had worked initially when I opened Xcode using sudo in terminal, but trying that again, I still am running into this issue. I've been looking everywhere online to find if anyone has had the same problem, and I've yet to find a solution. \n\nA: I had the same problem on my 13in non-Retina MacBook Pro. I fixed it by going to my project, building and running the project, and when the Simulator.app opened, I pressed the \"Stop\" button. \nThis worked for me, but it must be a bug in Xcode 7.0.1 because just a few days ago my simulator was running fine.\n\nA: The first thing to do is to isolate the issue to a user setting or a system issue. Actually, powering off the Mac would be the first thing to do and then re-test things in the current user/new user.\n\n\n*\n\n*make a new user and fire up Xcode in that user\n\n*test the simulator there\n\n\nAsk a follow on question with details of this step - how to fix a broken Xcode installation is different than fixing a broken user environment / settings.\n", "Q: Can't partition SSD Hello I tried to install Windows 10 on my Mid 2012 13' MacBook pro with a Samsung SSD 850 EVO 500GB installed. In Boot Camp it won't partition my SSD. I also tried it in disk utility but it doesn't even let me press the \"partition\" button.\n\n\n\nUpdate:\nThe result of sudo fdisk /dev/disk0:\n\n\nA: You have your SSD partitioned using a MBR Partition Table. I did not even know it was possible to boot OS X from a drive partitioned this way. Normally, you would use a GUID partition Table (GPT).\nI am not sure you can convert to a GPT without reinstalling OS X. You would need to update your question with the output from the Terminal application command given below.\nsudo fdisk /dev/disk0\n\nIf you can not convert to a GPT (which is most likely), you will need to boot to Internet Recovery and repartition the disk using a GUID Partition Map.  (Restart the Mac and hold down Command+Option+R keys after hearing the boot chime.) Afterwards, you can also download OS X, but it will not be version 10.11. Once you have reinstalled OS X, you can upgrade to El Captain (OS X 10.11). \nAfter all of this, you should be able to use the Boot Camp Assistant to install Windows 10.\nUpdate\nYour disk is partitioned using a \"Master Boot Record\" partition table. This is shown your Disk Utility image under the label Partitionstabelle (Partition Table). The command fdisk shows there is no extra available space to add a GUID Partition Table (GPT). You will need to repartition the drive as I stated in my above answer. When finished, the Disk Utility application should show the Partitionstabelle (Partition Table) as \"GUID Partition Map\". Below is what is displayed on my computer.\n\nAs for your existing OS X partition, it would be easiest to backup up your important data and restore after reinstalling OS X. Saving the entire OS X partition can be done, but you would need a fairly large external disk. I could give a outline of the procedure if you wish.\n", "Q: What happened to my macros after update to Word for Mac 14.5.7? AutoUpdate loaded the Office Service Pack 14.5.7. When I open MS Word, my macros are no longer there. I tried restoring my Normal.dotm file from \n~/Library/Application Support/Microsoft/Office/User Templates/\nJust realized that custom AutoCorrect entries still exist. I had assumed that they would be missing too.\nStill no macros are showing up. Is this a bug or am I missing something?\n\nA: Turns up that the Office update changed my preferences in MS Word.

The solution to this problem in previous versions of OS X was a checkbox in the trackpad preferences that said \"ignore accidental trackpad input.\" That option is no longer there in Yosemite.\nIs it still possible to enable it, and if so how?\n\nA: If you have a multi-touch trackpad Mac, the option no longer appears in System Preferences because it as enabled automatically. See https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201822.\nUpdate 2016-04-03-1007\nYou may want to give BetterTouchTool a try. It enables fine grained control of trackpad behavior. Three items that may interest you in particular:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disable trackpad gestures after hitting a keyboard key to prevent accidental gestures while typing\n\n*Thumb recognition (filters out thumb and palm . . .)\n\n*Reenable gestures only after touching the center area of the trackpad\n\n\nA: I was having similar issues after purchasing a new MBP.\nWhat seemed to fix it for me was to go into System Peferences > Trackpad > Point & Click and disable the following items:\nLook up & Data (Tap with three fingers)\nForce Click and haptic feedback\n\nSince I don't need any of those features I just disabled all of them.  I code and don't use a lot of fancy trackpad features.  Try playing around with those options to see what works best for you.  If you need those options some of the time, you could probably make a script to quickly toggle them on and off.\nUPDATE: Non-technical HACK:\nWhile some of these tricks seemed to have helped, I found a very easy way to eliminate accidental thumb clicks while typing.  Place a 1/2 inch width strip of electrical tape across the top of the trackpad.  It may not look pretty but it gets the job done with no further hacks required!\nTo insure the area of electrical tape is not trackable, use 2 layers of tape with a thin strip of aluminum foil between the layers. You probably could use clear or scotch tape for the top layer for a thinner profile. Just be careful the foil doesn't make direct contact with the trackpad itself as this will disable the trackpad. I recommend cutting the foil to be slightly smaller than the electrical tape.\n\n\nA: I created a project to address exactly this problem.\nAllow you to adjust size of ignored area on Trackpad,  The ignored area won't respond to any touches. It’s as if it’s not part of trackpad.\n\n\n\n\nA: Update\nKarabiner Multitouch extension no longer works on newer versions of MacOS so I recommend turning of tap-to-click when typing. \nUse this Apple Script to toggle \"typing mode\" if you want be sure your trackpad wont mess you up during frenetic typing sessions \nopen Applications > Utilities > Script Editor and paste the code from this script:\ntell application \"System Preferences\"\n    reveal anchor \"trackpadTab\" of pane \"com.apple.preference.trackpad\"\nend tell\ntell application \"System Events\" to tell process \"System Preferences\"\n    click checkbox 3 of tab group 1 of window 1\nend tell\nquit application \"System Preferences\"\n\nThen select File > Export and save in Applications but also make sure to select File Format > Application before saving. \nIf you want to make it very easy to run the toggle on and off, you may want to add a custom keyboard shortcut which would just run the toggle application\nOutdated\nI'm currently on El Capitan but this should work with any supported version of https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/\nYou can actually play with the settings and disable thumb clicks on the top part of the trackpad.   so this more or less does what my tape hack does sans the tape!\nUPDATE: I was not able to get this do completely fix accidental tap while typing. So here is my final advice:\nFor $6.50 you might wanna purchase Better Touch Tool For Mac which improves accidental thumb taps but not 100% perfect. \nTry these advanced settings:\n\n\n\nA: I created TouchGuard to address exactly this problem. TouchGuard disables the touchpad while typing on macOS. It is distributed as a pre-compiled, binary executable and a plist file and, when installed, runs as a system-wide daemon.\nYou can download and install the TouchGuard binary and the plist file as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the repository from GitHub:\n\n\n*Extract ZIP file to Desktop.\n\n*Run this command in Terminal to make the TouchGuard executable:\ncd Desktop\nchmod +x TouchGuard\n\n\n*Copy TouchGuard to /usr/bin/ folder.\n\n*Copy org.amanagr.TouchGuard.driver.Daemon.plist to /Library/LaunchDaemons.\n\n*Reboot.\n\n\nNote: source code from: https://github.com/thesyntaxinator/TouchGuard\n\nA: I changed \"Click\" to \"Firm\" in the menu. \nSystem Peferences > Trackpad > Point & Click\nIt seems to have helped. \n", "Q: \"More info\" button missing in \"About this Mac\" I have a macbook pro running Yosemite 10.10.5.

I've MAMP running httpd server as _www and I'd like to assign the temporary directory as part of the shell script (bash).\nI've tried to use $TMPDIR as per these posts:\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I find the 'temp' directory in Linux?\n\n*Where is the Temp folder in OS X?\nhowever it points to /var/folders/vp/tlt7xf791gl1_v56m0xdmrph0000gn/T/ and this folder has not necessary permissions, so Apache server can't create any files in there.\nBased on this:\n$ /usr/bin/stat -F $TMPDIR /tmp /private/tmp \ndrwx------ 104 kenorb staff 3536 Oct 14 22:21:05 2015 /var/folders/vp/tlt7xf791gl1_v56m0xdmrph0000gn/T//\nlrwxr-xr-x 1 root wheel 11 Apr  9 13:08:03 2014 /tmp@ -> private/tmp\ndrwxrwxrwt 112 root wheel 3808 Oct 14 22:12:04 2015 /private/tmp/\n\nMy www user which I care about:\n$ id _www\nuid=70(_www) gid=70(_www) groups=70(_www),12(everyone),61(localaccounts),401(com.apple.sharepoint.group.1),100(_lpoperator)\n\nI can't use /tmp, because it's linked to my /private/tmp (which name states it's private).\nTherefore how do I determine my correct temporary directory on OS X, so I and my httpd server can use it?\nI don't want to hardcode value, as the script would be useless when used on different environments (e.g. on non-MAMP environment), so the location can vary.\n\nA: I would write to /tmp (which is equivalent to writing to /private/tmp ) since it's writable by all users and not just administrative users. It's there for compatibility and for bonus points, your script can clean up files or cut them if they grow too large.\nI don't have an authoritative reference to why /private was called that, but it's always been open to writing and isn't restricted like $TMPDIR is from non-admin users.\nThe real question is what user are you running apache - a member of the ADMIN group or just a normal non-admin user?\nApple documents this in the Secure Coding Guide with the admonition that writing files to publicly readable locations is inherently insecure and that it's better to place files in more protected locations that aren't readable by all users. See the Race Conditions and Secure File Operations section and this link on creating secure temporary files. By using the mkstemp POSIX call you ensure a unique file is created and can control access with umask.\nOddly (to me), mktemp when run by a non-admin user can still make a temp file in $TMPDIR so it's clearly using escalated privileges to hand off that more \"secure\" file to non-admin users. Pretty cool. \n\nA: As for workaround, I've found so far that php command can determine the right temporary directory from the www perspective (assuming PHP CLI has\nthe same settings as server):\n$ php -r \"echo ini_get('upload_tmp_dir');\"\n/Applications/MAMP/tmp/php\n\nIt's possible also to use mktemp to check where the temporary files are created for specific user (as $TMPDIR would fail), e.g.:\n$ sudo -uwww bash -c 'dirname $(mktemp)'\n/tmp\n\n\nSo in summary this could be extended to something like:\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\nWWW_USER=\"$(ps axo user,group,comm | egrep \"(apache|httpd)\" | grep -v ^root | uniq | cut -d\\  -f 1)\"\nPHP=\"$(which php)\"\n\nif [ -n \"$PHP\" ]; then\n  TMP=\"$(php -r \"echo ini_get('upload_tmp_dir');\")\"\nelif [ -n \"$WWW_USER\" ]; then\n  TMP=\"$(sudo -uwww bash -c 'dirname $(mktemp)')\"\nelif [ -n \"$TMPDIR\" ]; then\n  TMP=\"$TMPDIR\"\nelse\n  TMP=\"/tmp\"\nfi\n\n", "Q: \"Remote Desktop Client\" updated, but NOT installed I just purchased a used iMac yesterday.

My volume is turned up, it's not on mute, alarms and other things that make noise work, it's not set to \"do not disturb\" or anything like that. If I happen to have the iPad open when a Facetime call arrives I can see it, but it's silent and not ringing.  Facetime works fine except if somebody calls me it won't ring. \n\nA: Go to ‘Settings’, then to ‘Do Not Disturb’ and make sure it is set to allow all calls from FaceTime.\nGo to ‘Settings’, then ‘Sounds’, and make sure you have a ringtone for calls / FaceTime set.\nFinally, make sure your iPad is not in Mute mode by swiping from bottom of the screen upwards and tapping the ‘Bell’ icon to disable it (or, if you have an older device, and you have ‘Mute’ set under ‘General / Use side switch to...’, switch the side switch on). Having Mute mode enabled will prevent the device making any sound when called.\n\nA: Several things have to go correctly when an incoming FaceTime call happens.\n\n\n*\n\n*Apple's push notification servers have to have a recent internet address for the \"location\" of your iPad.\n\n*The network needs to deliver that push notification to your router.\n\n*Your router needs to send a wake notification if your iPad is sleeping.\n\n*Your iPad needs to be connected to the WiFi network or wake and reconnect, get an IP address, receive the push notification before the call times out.\n\n\nThings that make your network more reliable:\n\n\n*\n\n*Cellular Data connection on the iPad so that there is a chance to receive the notification from WiFi and from the cellular data\n\n*Plug the iPad into power so that the radios take longer to power off and dissociate from the network.\n\n*reduce network congestion on your network\n\n*increase the signal between your iPad and the providing WiFi and cellular data radio base stations\n\n*connecting to the WiFi each time you change network locations to update Apple's push servers with your iPad's current location. For example - if I leave my house and go to a coffee shop with my iPad in a bag - it won't connect to the coffee shop and receive FaceTime without my help since \n\n\nYou can also ask people to send you an iMessage before they try to face time or to make two face time calls in a row. The first notification might wake up the router and iPad and the second would then go through.\n\nA: In our case, Do Not Disturb was on in Notification Center.\n\nA: Go into settings,notifications,FaceTime,sounds, then select your ring tone preference.\n", "Q: Best app to read rss feed in real time Could someone help to find best free / paid Mac OS or iOS (or both) app for reading rss feed in real time?

I want to know if using Mac OS Extended Journaled is the right choice for a MacBook Pro that would only be connected with the external hard drive at night. It does not make sense to me to have it journaling every action of a Mac that is not always connected.  \nI also want to use the same external hard drive for Time Machine backups. What is the right way set up an external hard drive to do file backups with a MacBook.  \nI am confused on how a journaled file system and Time Machine aren't related processes.\nDo I do both or do they both happen together?\nHow do they work?  \n\nA: I will try to explain journaling as I see it. I probably will not give the process completely right, but you will have a better idea of how journaling works. \nLet us say I want to write some new data to the journal file system. The steps would be something like the following.\n\n\n*\n\n*The operating system writes a new entry to the journal. This entry\nstates the I want to write the new data. The operating system also\nincludes what every information would be needed to undo the\noperation.\n\n*The operating system marks in the journal that it finished making\nthe journal entry.\n\n*The operating system now goes through the process of writing the new\ndata to the drive.\n\n*The operating system marks in the journal that it has\ncompleted the task stated in the journal entry. The space used in\nthe journal by this entry can now be reused.\n\n\nIf the system crashes during these steps, then the following happens during restart of he computer. \nIf the computer never completed step 2, then the journal entry can me marked completed so the space can be reused. In other words, the task of writing the data was never started, so the journal entry can be ignored.\nIf the computer completed step 2, but not step 4, then the information stored in the journal entry is used to return the file system to the state before the journal entry was made. After this is completed, the journal entry can be marked as completed so the space can be reused.\nSo journaling is a temporary operation that helps prevent the corruption of a file system. This slows down access to the drive, usually this cost is outweighed by the benefit of the protection.\nTime machine backups are a permanent backup of changes made to your drive. You can use the backup to restore parts or all of your file system to a previous state.\n\nA: *\n\n*Journaling protects the file system. It will delete a file if things crash in the middle of an operation to let the system be \"consistent\"\n\n*Backups protect the files. You can go back and get the file when the journaling or a mistake or a crash renders a specific file broken or gone.\nSee What are the differences between journaling HFS+ and non-journaling HFS+? for what chances between a non-journaled filesystem and a journaled one. It's a bit technical, but that's where you are when you get down to file system journaling.\n\nA: A journaling file system monitors low-level file system operations like creating, deleting or moving files and folders on a volume. By logging all atomic tasks in the journal and deleting them after the operation has been finalized successfully, it always tracks the current state of the file system.\nEvery volume with a journaling file system contains its own journal.\nSince all the operations need several steps to finalize, a power loss or a system crash may leave the file system in a non-consistent or unknown state.\nAfter a crash or a power loss the presumably corrupted file system has to be checked and repaired if necessary. The journal may dramatically decrease the time needed to complete the task by providing informations about open operation.\nThe journal usually doesn't contain any data of a particular file but only metadata.\n\nBacking up a volume or parts of it with Time Machine creates a duplicate of the chosen files and folders on a separate volume. If you lose your Mac, delete a file or folder accidentally or the main hard drive dies you will still have a copy of the data on your backup volume and may recover it.\n\nA power loss or crash can affect all mounted volumes, including the main volume and the backup volume. A crash while backing up files on a backup volume (which is nothing more than file system operations on a second volume) has the same consequences as on the main volume: the file system can be non-consistent. After a crash both volumes are checked for errors.\nTo keep track of all file system operations (even on the backup volume) and decrease potential repair times, enabling Journaling on a backup volume is recommended.\n", "Q: Google Chrome display corrupted over VNC Over VNC, everything looks great except Google Chrome, which is completely messed up (image below).

Any idea what changed in OS X 10.11 that would cause this behavior?\n\nA: Updating to the latest version of the Logitech Control Center fixed the issue.\nhttp://support.logitech.com/software/logitech-control-center-for-macintosh-os-x\n", "Q: OS X El Capitan different behaviours at start I have two MacBook Pro mid 2013, same hardware inside.\nIn the first one I had the following sequence of OSs.\nMountain Lion (factory) > Mavericks > Yosemite > El Capitan > El Capitan (Clean Install)\nAnd whenever I start the Mac I have this flow\nApple Logo > User login (my user + guest user) > Loading (progress bar) > OS loaded\nIn the second MacBook I had\nMountain Lion (factory) > El Capitan\nAnd this flow at start\nApple Logo > Loading (progress bar) > User login (my user + guest user) > OS \"lazy\" loaded (\"lazy\" = Status bar is loaded a few seconds after the screen with dock is presented)\nSince there is a clearly difference in the behaviour of the two OSs, my question is: why does this happen? Is there a problem with one of the OSs? Which is the correct flow?\n\nA: It might be that in the first case the boot partition is encrypted with FileVault. You then need to login to be able to read the boot partition.\n\nA: I have went through similar steps as you with your first MBP and have the same flow as yours. I have watched quite a lot of videos of the new OS's and as far as I know the \"flow\" should be : Apple Logo -> login -> loading bar -> Desktop.\n\nI am not 100% sure but I think I have been given a loading screen right after the Apple Logo but right now I can't think of the reason. Point being: Your first MBP is fine for sure. The loading after the apple logo on your second one might be just some updates? installing in the background. Try using it more intensively and if the loading doesn't stop appearing I guess you would have to do a clean install. Either way I think you should be good running both the way they are.\n", "Q: Finder error -36 when copying from data Blu-ray to HD I've been having a re-occurring problem reading data from self-burnt data Blu-ray discs. I'll try to copy the contents of a disc to an external HD and nearly every time, at some point during the copy, I'll get a -36 Error code from the Finder (data can't be read or written).\nJust before this error the drive spins down and I can hear the head jumping around, like it's having trouble finding data. The drive will do that for between 2-10+ minutes before giving up finally and showing me the error code.\nThis tends to happen on similar types of file – usually files that are packages (Logic files, Photos library), Logic project backups and EXS24 sample files (AIFs). Sometimes copying that file again works, sometimes not.\nThese discs were originally burnt through the Finder and they all passed post-burn verification. So the question is: where might the problem be? Is it the OS? Is it the drive? Is it the discs? Really I have no answer.\n(I'm running fully updated Mac OS 10.10.5, Blu-ray drive is a Samsung SE-506, discs are TDK-branded light blue face.)\n\nA: So I came up with a sort-of answer here. In short, a full copy of the Blu-ray was possible using the ditto command line tool:\nditto [source path] [destination path]\n\nDuring the operation ditto does show errors (in my case Unknown error: 10000), but it does continue with copying the remaining files.\nMore detail\nIn figuring this out I started by inspecting the Console for errors during a Finder drag and drop copy. Sure enough an error was logged:\n30/10/2015 19:54:57.000 kernel[0]: udf error: errno_t UDFFileNode::ReadPathComponent(uint8_t *, off_t *, bool *): Incomplete path component\n\nOn searching for 'mac udf error readpathcomponent error' I found this post on Adobe's forum which pointed to symbolic links being the problem.\nTwo types of file causing me an error were iPhoto and Photos Library files, and sure enough, within their packages there are symbolic links to certain .db and .apdb files. It appears the Finder attempts to resolve those links when drag and drop copying, but when it can't find that data (which isn't on the Blu-ray) it stops the copy and throws a -36 error.\nTo confirm this I looked for another way to copy the files, finding the ditto tool. Supporting my theory, the errors ditto threw up during the copy all related to symbolic links. So this might be a Finder bug rather than a hardware problem.\n", "Q: ITunes resets syncing of books to \"Selected books\" instead of \"All books\" I have both an iPad and an iPhone, and I sync them both with the same computer. I read a lot of ebooks, and I keep them in iBooks, so that I can switch between all my devices. (I also have a number of audiobooks, which I only use from my phone or laptop, never from the iPad).\nI have all my devices set to automatically sync all books. But for a while now, when I've synced the iPad, it's reset itself to sync \"Selected books\" instead of \"All books\", so that I've had to go back to iTunes and re-select \"All books\" and do a second sync in order to get all of my books transferred.\nThis only happens with the iPad, not with the iPhone. I've had this iPad for a while; I don't recall having had the issue the whole time, but I also don't recall exactly when it started or if I did something to cause it. \nI have tried doing a complete reset and reinstall of the iPad, but the problem came back as soon as I'd done my first sync.\nIs there any way I can make iTunes stop resetting my book sync preferences?\n\nA: I got the idea to compare the settings for the iPhone and the iPad. The only difference was that I'm syncing all my audiobooks to the phone, but not to the iPad.\nSo, I turned on the setting \"Sync audiobooks\" and \"All audiobooks\". And now the system no longer resets to syncing only selected ebooks. \n", "Q: Does unsupported RAM effect display cards? I have a MacBook Pro 17\" Mid 2010 which normally supports 1067 MHz RAM. I needed more memory and installed 2 x 4 GB RAM 1333 MHz modules which - as expected -  also work with 1067 MHz.\nAfter a couple of weeks the display started flickering and showed disturbances similar to television statics for a second and then returns to normal. A couple of weeks later this happens more frequently like every 5-9 minutes. It especially occurs when a secondary display is attached.\nCould the RAM modules cause this or is my display card just dying?\n\nThis is how it looks like: video\n\nA: Yes. Apple uses some of your RAM as VRAM as explained in this answer.\nSo using unsupported RAM can affect your integrated video card.  Try switching back to the stock modules that came with the device and see if you can still replicate your problem.\n\nA: This is almost certainly a graphics card problem. You could try putting the old RAM modules back in and see if that solves it, but generally, systemwide graphics corruption = GPU problems, either the GPU itself or the VRAM.\nAnother hypothesis is that this is a software related problem on the 2010 machines, e.g. something like this, but that impacts specific applications rather than the whole screen.\nA way you could either temporarily work around this problem or determine if it is indeed the GPU is by downloading gfxCardStatus and forcing the system to use the integrated GPU.\n", "Q: How to fix SyncMate kernel panic at El Capitan boot I've recently installed El Capitan. The other day I restarted my computer for the first time for a while, and now it doesn't boot. I restarted in verbose mode and can see that there's a kernel panic relating to com.eltima.SyncMate.kext.  It seemed like that was probably an incompatible extension, so I took a copy of the kext and then deleted EltimaAsync.kext from /System/Library/Extensions. \nSadly, when I rebooted, the problem persisted with the same kernel panic. I've searched high and low for other references to \"eltima\" anywhere on the drive, but I haven't found anything that looks relevant. I'm wondering if perhaps the kext has been pre-compiled in somewhere. I don't know if it's relevant, but the drive in question is encrypted with FileVault.\nIs there something I can do to properly disable this kext so I can get the computer to boot? If possible I'd really like to avoid having to start from a clean install, even though I do have a good backup.\n\nA: So, for anyone who is in a similar position to me, the critical step that I was missing after getting rid of the offending .kext, was removing the various caches that were resulting in it still getting loaded during the FileVault startup process.\nRemoving /var/vm/sleep* and /var/folders/* from the FileVault volume caused all the caches to be rebuilt and the system booted correctly.\n\nA: When you say the Mac doesn't boot - can you get it booted in safe mode (holding shift)? If so, you can delete the kext and try again a normal boot.\nWorst case, you could boot into Recovery HD and open terminal from the utilities menu. Delete the offending kernel extension and then try booting again.\n\nA: Only one thing in addition.

I want to copy files from OS X (El Capitan) to my Nexus phone (which uses Android 6) and vice versa. And I just mean copying locally, i.e. over USB cable, I want to avoid overcomplicating things with upload and download through intermediary servers.\nIn the past I used Android File Transfer for this. But that was with a previous OS X version, and my old phone with Android 5. I tried again, but it doesn't work anymore, it keeps saying:\n\nCan't access device storage.\nIf your device's screen is locked, disconnect its USB cable, unlock your screen, and then reconnect the USB cable.\n\nThe screen is most definitely not locked, and dis+reconnecting the USB cable (either end) doesn't help. \n\nA: In Android 6 there is new connection mode - charging from usb. In this mode you can't transfer any data. I faced it on my Nexus 5 with El Capitan.  \nSolution was easy - change connection mode to data transfer. I used this mode before, but with Android 6 phone set default connection mode to \"charging\".\n\nA: *\n\n*Pull down notification menu.\n\n*Tap \"USB for charging / Touch for more options\"\n\n*Tap \"Transfer files (MTP)\"\n\n\nA: As far as I know, you need drivers in order to do that. You can download android drivers for instance here. Linux Ubuntu seemingly allows this already from my experience but it didn't work all the time and threw cannot mount errors. Rooted phones also make it easier to transfer files.\nPeople could have problems with the update to Android 6 or El Capitan. You can in that case try re-installing, or enabling developer options (Tap build number in about this device in settings 7 times to unlock developer options, then enable USB Debugging).\n\nA: So I was having this same problem with my LG G4 + OSX El Cap interface and could not find anything to get a USB connection.  After repeated poor data transfers (errors) with the LG Bridge, I started searching again and found a site that suggested FIRST to download AppCleaner to scrub the residual system files out.  Then delete all android interface apps (Bridge, Kies, etc). I even deleted Android File Transfer to preclude the possibility for corruption.  I ran my file scrubber and deleted any residual system files, then reinstalled AFT.  IT WORKED!!!

I am sure the addresses and groups still exist since, if I create an email and type a group name into, say, BCC, they all appear. \nHow can I restore the Contacts \"book?\"\n\nA: The contacts in your email may be different from the Contacts app, since Mail can check your past emails for addresses. Real quick though, is there a list of address books (local, iCloud, Facebook, etc) on the left side of the Contacts app, and maybe you are \"in\" the wrong one?\nThe first thing you should do to make sure you still have your addresses on iCloud, provided you used to sync them to iCloud, is to log on to icloud.com with your Apple ID and password. If you see your contacts on there, you're good.\nThen you should be able to go to the iCloud account settings in System Preferences (you can use the Spotlight option in System Preferences to find it if you need help) and make sure you're signed in to iCloud and that you have Contacts selected to sync.\nIf they are not on iCloud, and you have a Time Machine backup, open Contacts and go in to Time Machine to restore them.\n\nA: I had the same problem after my upgrade to Sierra. The contact app said \"no cards\". I saw the suggestion in the first response \"is there a list of address books (local, iCloud, Facebook, etc) on the left side of the Contacts app, and maybe you are \"in\" the wrong one?\" When I looked, there was nothing on the left side. I went up to the view menu and clicked on \"show groups\". Immediately all of my contact appeared!\n\nA: I just went to system preferences and clicked on iCloud and saw that \"contacts\" was not checked off.

Is it possible to use OpenConnect or some other VPN alternative on macOS? Has anyone done this successfully?\nThe only software I've been able to find saying it is possible is http://www.feingeist.io/shimo/ which costs €50 :-o\n\nA: OpenConnect works great on El Capitan. I use the text commands to connect to my work VPN.\nThere's a Gist with a walkthrough of setup instructions using the Homebrew installer: https://gist.github.com/moklett/3170636\nOn El Capitan, the \"rootless\" protection prevents you from installing the unauthorized \"tun tap\" kernel driver extension that OpenConnect needs.\nHowever, a Mac app called Viscosity comes with a signed (authorized) copy of tun tap. Viscosity has a limited trial, but the driver is free. https://www.sparklabs.com/viscosity/\nInstall Viscosity and run the app once to get the helper (driver) installed.

For me this is a file corruption.\nHence I would like to uninstall cleanly Pages 5.5.3 to avoid any internal misbehaviour and file corruption.\n(Pages 5.5.3 is an example which is an annoying one, disturbing my work. But I have the same problem with applications I installed to check their real functions. Then I discovered these to not correctly answer my needs. I would like to be able to cleanly and safely uninstall these useless applications.)\nAfter scanning all menu entries (with the ⌥ key pressed too) and the internal help, I discovered that I can't find an easy way to uninstall an application installed within App Store.\nClearly this function isn't within App Store.\nWhat is the correct and safe method to uninstall an App Store application, with a resonable control this won't damage any related application?\n\nA: You can see exactly what was installed by the appstore with this command:\nlsbom /private/var/db/receipts/com.apple.pkg.Pages5.bom\n\nlsbom /private/var/db/receipts/com.apple.pkg.Pages5.bom | grep -v '/Applications/Pages.app' will show you all the files which are not in the /Applications/Pages.app folder (which is actually nothing).\nBeware that each new update via the appstore will overwrite this bom file, and not create a version-specific one.  The bom should reflect the current installed files.\nAssuming you installed iWork09 from the DVD, then the files in /Applications/iWork '09/ as well as the support files in /Library should not have been affected.\n\nA: They use their own files, no need to 'uninstall'. You can even use them side-by-side! As for the root of your issue: it's mostly the UI that was updated, functionality should be the same. \n", "Q: How do I rearrange my watch faces in watchOS 2? I have a lot of watch faces, I change them a few times a day. But as I keep adding new ones, they are added very far to the rightmost of the list of existing watch faces.\nIs there a way to rearrange my watch faces, so that I can put my most frequently used faces close together?\n\nA: AFAIK, there is no way to easily rearrange them. As you probably know, you could take note of which complication went where on every and delete all the watch faces and then add them again in the order that you want, but that would be very time consuming and if you change your mind later then you'd have to do the whole thing over again. Apple should have let the user rearrange watch faces in watchOS 1 or at least watchOS 2.0, but it looks like we'll just have to hope that this is implemented in watchOS 2.1 or 3.\nAdding on, you can send feedback to Apple here.\n", "Q: Reset wallpaper of 2nd monitor without having connection to 2nd monitor?

And also did not appear the partition of the operating system (8gb).\nWhat I did to solve the situation was:\n1 - put the windows.iso file in the same location where it was (in my case on the desktop)\n2 - open the disk utility and erase the partition \"bootcamp\"\n4 - unmount the partition \"bootcamp\"\n5 - reopen the bootcamp, and do \"restore\"\n3 - I'm not sure if I've formatted it, but if the previous steps doesn't work try this step too.

I'm trying to take a movie that I need to analyze for an essay and split it into 18 movie files, one for each chapter (as defined by pre-existing chapter markers), for ease of watching one scene at a time and then stopping to write about it. How do I accomplish this?\n\nA: My solution is: In Handbrake> check Create chapter markers\nThen load the movie into Lossless-cut ( mifi /\nlossless-cut / releases).\nIt will (ask to) import the chapters as cut segments.\nVery quick and easy!\n\nA: I solved this by using Handbrake.\n\n\n*\n\n*Select the movie as the source file.\n\n*Near the upper right of the Handbrake window, there's an option to select a range of chapters. Tell it to go from 1 to 1.\n\n*Name the destination file 1.mp4, so that it can be distinguished from the other files that are soon to be created.\n\n*Start the encoding.\n\n*Repeat this process for every chapter of the movie, clicking Add to Queue so that the files will be lined up to be created immediately after 1 is finished.\nSure enough, now I've got 18 movie files that together make up an entire film!\nTo my knowledge, no one has asked this question online before, so I figured I'd share my answer with the world.

Let me know if this helps: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7MgVBGfFCo\n\nA: Another solution, without re-encoding. If you only want to split the video into multiple files you can use mkvtoolnix . Use handbrake to find the chapter timestamps and mkvtoolnix to do the splitting.\n\nA: Movie Splitter\nI wrote Movie Splitter to split movies by chapter. Both 3GPP and QuickTime chapter track information is supported:\n\nMovies can be split using chapter information embedded within the source movie. Chapter information is automatically detected by Movie Splitter.\n\n*\n\n*Automatically by chapter marker\n\n*Into two halves\n\n*Into four quarters\n\n*Into unlimited custom sections\n\n*Into regular durations; 1 second to multi-hour sections\n\n\n\n", "Q: iOS - version history Is there an official version history for iOS?\nThe best similar thing I have found is on Wikipedia: iOS Version History\nIs there something similar, that is official?

I've had the phone 3 weeks [new 6s] & never spotted it before.\nIt's not something I need to 'fix' but I wonder if anyone knows what may trigger it; & why it took 3 weeks to ask me for the first time.\n.. or, incidentally & totally opinion-based - why it thinks a 6-digit code is more secure than my fingerprint.\nLate thought:\nDoes it do it 2 days after a reboot or OS update?\nIt's done it just one more time, which was perhaps 48h+ after the 9.1 update.\nCurrent guess is it's \"new to iOS 9\" which is why people have been seeing it on older devices too.\nI'm still convinced I get it once after every update - but it's something I just dismiss without thinking until later, when I've lost the train of thought that would allow me to 'accurately guesstimate' when it was last rebooted.\n\nA: The first part of your question has to be a glitch. The iPhone 6S is still a little buggy; mine doesn't always play system sounds, like the Siri chime and the lock \"click\" sound. But I can explain the second part of your questing:\nApple thinks that a passcode is more secure than TouchID is due to the fact that the odds of TouchID giving a false-positive are 1 in 50,000 (stated by Apple). However, the article hasn't been updated after the 2nd-Generation TouchID in the iPhone 6S came out, and given its great speed improvements, I would assume that the 2nd-Gen has a lower chance of giving a false-positive than the 1st-Gen. The odds of guessing a 6-digit passcode, would be literally 1 in 1,000,000. Even the odds of guessing right with 5 guesses, 1 in approximately 200,000 is still higher than TouchID. I like the convenience of TouchID and will still use it everyday, but from a purely statistical standpoint, a passcode is much more secure.\n\nA: The passcode superseeds the TouchID, the AppleID-password superseeds the passcode.\nThere's (arguably) nothing wrong with old styled passcodes.  TouchID was not created because it's better than passcodes, it was implemented because it was just faster, more easy and convenient.  \nHence the fact you cannot turn off the passcode, but you can turn off the TouchID.  If you chop off your fingers, you still can enter your phone using the passcode (though I admit it would be significantly more difficult physically).  If you lost your passcode, you still can reset it via iCloud.com.\nThe fact you have to re-enter your passcode (and on other occasions, your Apple ID password) after reset or 48 hours, is Apple's way to help you not forgetting those.\nThis is my personal view - but if you're looking at it like this, IMHO it makes more sense.\n", "Q: Prohibitory sign showing on Mac startup While trying to install OS X El Capitan there was a brief power cut mid installation then the Mac tried to restart it first brought up the apple logo then brought up the prohibitory symbol.

Also, consider disabling wake for network access if you have that enabled.\nThat's the main cause of periodic wake events. You could have some off USB connection glitch that's waking things, but start with power nap and then eliminate connected USB devices one by one.\nLastly, in Bluetooth preferences, you might choose to not let bluetooth devices wake your Mac in the Advanced settings (button in the bottom right of the preference pane).\nThere's nothing wrong with those wakes as I see it - how long is the machine awake each interval? 10-15 seconds or 10-15 minutes?\n\nA: What worked for me (issue with battery drain after sleep): \nSettings & Prefs -> Energy Saver -> Power Adapter ,\nUncheck Wake for Ethernet network access\nSettings & Prefs -> Bluetooth ,\nTurn off\nDevice:\nEl Capitan - Mid 2010 15\"\nI don't have power nap on this model\nMy logs were showing the following before:\n<Notice>: Wake reason: EHC2\n<Notice>: Wake reason: EC LID0\n<Notice>: Wake reason: PWRB (User)\n<Notice>: Wake reason: EC LID0\n<Notice>: Wake reason: EC LID0\n<Notice>: Wake reason: EHC2\n<Notice>: Wake reason: EC LID0\n<Notice>: Wake reason: EC LID0\n<Notice>: Wake reason: PWRB EC LID0 (User)\n<Notice>: Wake reason: EC LID0 EHC2\n\n", "Q: How do I open a filtered port in pf?

I would like to enable it, but I can't find it in the settings on my iPhone 5c (ME501DN/A) with iOS 9.0.2.\nThank you very much.\n\nA: The mentioned \"Shake to Shuffle\" feature is gone since iOS 8.4, so enabling or disabling it doesn't make sense anymore - so the option for this is also gone from the Music options screen. (Thank you Tetsujin for the tipp.)\nOn iOS 8.1 one can find it in options under the Music category. It is right the first option in the Music options category. You can enable or disable it here. (In English it is called \"Shake to Shuffle\", but I am using the iPhone in German, so is called \"Schüttelfunktion\" here (= \"Shaking function\").)\n", "Q: Use mdfind to identify all encrypted dmg? Can someone suggest a clever way to identify all dmg that are encrypted?\nMy only idea is rather complicated. use mdfind '(kMDItemFSName=*.dmg)' and then test the response from hdiutil imageinfo and log the result of those that ask for a password. Thanks to the answer and comments, the following command runs all the dmg through hdiutil, but I can't figure out how to identify the ones that give an error. Any ideas?\nmdfind -0 \"kMDItemFSName=*.dmg\" |xargs -0 -I{} -L 1 hdiutil imageinfo {}\n\n\nA: Spotlight just doesn't have sufficient metadata to differentiate the filesystem choices stored inside a DMG. Put another way, it's like asking what Pages documents have French words in them just using mdls. The data to make that search isn't contained in metadata.\nThe proper command to check if a specific image file is encrypted is hdiutil isencrypted /path/to/dmg\nExample:\nhost:~ user$ hdiutil isencrypted /Users/user/Downloads/test.dmg\n\nOutput:\nencrypted: YES\nblocksize: 512\nuuid: DE78A7BE-2B64-4556-8EC9-93DFAC15A839\nprivate-key-count: 0\npassphrase-count: 1\nmax-key-count: 1\nversion: 2\n\n\nA: At the present time on my local disk I have 88 .dmg files, three of which are encrypted.

The files can also be opened in a text editor.\nThe files will contain the fully qualified pathname of the .dmg files followed by a space and either encrypted: NO or encrypted: YES in the dmg_file_list file and only the fully qualified pathname of the .dmg files followed by a space and encrypted: YES in the encrypted_dmg_file_list file.\nYou can then manually delete the two files created by the command when finished with them.\nNote: Once the command line is executed if may take a moment to process and output the contents of the encrypted_dmg_file_list file to the Terminal.  It will depend on just how many .dmg files there are.\nHere is the full command line shown with line continuation so you make sure to copy and paste the entire line.

When I went through the setup procedure, it didn't ask me what password to use for my account, and just set it to that of my AppleID. (I only discovered that by trial and error.)\nI now want to set my password to the same one that I use on the old Mac; but the password (eight characters, includes some digits, which BTW is also exactly true of my AppleID password) is rejected.\nWhen I simply run passwd while logged in as myself, it fails saying:\n\npasswd: general failure\n\nAnd when I run it as sudo passwd mike, it is more precise:\n\npasswd: Password change failed because password is too short.  Password change failed because password is too short.\n\n(Yes, it says it twice.)\nIt also does this when I use 13-character password. It doesn't say how long a password it requires and I am not minded to determine this by trial and error.\nHow can I force my Mac to accept the password of my choice?\n\nA: Try to change it by going to System Preferences -> Users & Groups -> your account, and click on Change Password...\n\nA: Password policy is only enforced on OS X if you have a profile setting it or if the machine is bound to a directory server.\n\n\n*\n\n*Checking profiles is the easiest - Open your System Preferences and go to the Profiles preference pane.\n\n*Checking binding can be done by opening terminal and showing the status:  \n\n\ndsconfigad -show \nDelete any profiles that are setting password policy / restrictions and you will then be able to choose your desired password. Or you can reach out to the people that set your password policy and see what can be done to change the restrictions they have placed on your Mac. This isn't something that Apple defines as the out of the box experience as local passwords can be as short and insecure as you wish. You could have no password by pressing enter in the Users & Groups preference pane where you change the password using the normal graphical interface.\n\nA: I have heard you can download an app called WorkGroup Manager, but I don't think it is available anymore, not that I know of. \nYou can try going to Terminal on the Mac by going to Applications, then Utilities. Open the Terminal app and type the command pwpolicy.\nI would not do this however, if you are not comfortable with using Terminal since it is a command-line interface and you have to type your commands on what you want to do. The command, pwpolicy,  will give you info on what policies you can use to set for  different users. I have not messed with it, but I looked into it and it is not as easy as it sounds.\n\nA: As of 10.14 (Mojave), the default rule that will be enforced for accounts that are created after the first account, is Enter a password that is four characters or more or leave the password field blank. While it should be displayed in the error shown to the user, you can find this information in terminal by typing the command pwpolicy getaccountpolicies. If you want to see the policies for just one account, follow that command with the account name.\n\nSide note: In older versions of OSX the command was pwpolicy getglobalpolicy. I don't know in which version the command changed.\n\nThe plist for this policy shows the following RegEx: ^$|.{4,}+\nNote that this policy does not seem to be enforced when setting up the very first user after a clean install. Instead, the only requirement is that the password not be blank. \n\nA: Try using System Preferences.  Under Users & Groups, you can select your account and click \"Change Password...\".  You will be asked for your current password.  This should work, although if you set up your Mac to use your iCloud login, then you may run into some difficulties.\nIf you're trying to set a password and System Preferences doesn't like it, the most risky way, but at the same time the most accepting way for short password is the command line.\nOpen Terminal:\nsudo su -\nsudo passwd mike\n\nYou can then change your password to whatever you want, even a 1 character password.  This is not recommended, but if System Preferences rejectes you, the command line will take it this way.\n", "Q: Hard drive always visible on desktop I have one HD named Macintosh HD.\nI can’t tell when it happened, but since a few days my HD shows up on my desktop.

This will show every available boot option\n\n*Make sure you are using a USB keyboard attached directly to the machine\n\n\nA: Holding CMD + C will not boot of an USB, only a DVD.\nYou need to hold the option key then select the USB Drive, which will  be most-likely named EFI. Also make sure you aren’t plugging it in through any USB hubs and just directly into the computer.\nNote:\nIf your able to install El Captain on your computer, doesn’t mean it will run well. Because of its age it can possibly be very laggy and be very hard to use, personally I’d recommend at max using Yosemite.\n\nA: Even though the Core 2 Duo is technically 64-bit, it won't run anything newer than Snow Leopard (10.6.8). \n", "Q: Sublime Text 2 - Save Dialogue Tab Issues I've started using Sublime Text 2 on OS X and its great apart from one small thing.\nI've enabled Tab to go through all controls:\n\nHowever, I cannot tab through on this dialogue that pops up when I try and close a window after making changes\n\nIs there a fix to this or is this something that I'm going to have to open a thread on the forum?\n\nA: Chances are high you have the same keybinding active in Sublime.  \nSublime Text uses a huge load of hotkeys/combinations and these are all defined in a simple textfile.\nGo to \"Menu/Sublime Text/Preferences/Key Bindings - Default\", search for that combination and comment it out (or assign it to another hotkey).\n", "Q: iPhone blocked network problem I recently brought a iPhone 5 from a seller and did the iOS9 update. Everything appeared fine at first, but now the phone won't make phone calls. It keeps saying: \"This handset has been blocked on this network.\"\nWhat does that mean and how do I fix it?\nI can send and receive SMS messages as normal.\n\nA: This message has nothing to do with the iOS version of your phone, The message : This handset has been blocked on this network means that the handset has been reported as lost or stolen, probably by the previous owner. You need to contact the seller and ask him if the phone he sold to you was not stolen or found. \nIf you have access to your IMEI (that you can find in Settings --> General --> Information) use this website to check the status of your handset http://www.amta.org.au/pages/amta/Check.the.Status.of.your.Handset\n", "Q: Why is SubmitDiagInfo failing on Yosemite?

SubmitDiagInfo failed to submit diagnostic messages\n\nIs this a concern?  If so, is there a cure?\n\nA: When your Mac generates diagnostic logs, submitting them to Apple helps them know what issues are actually happening as opposed to one person reporting a bug. In the long term, not sending any reports is bad for you since your issues will be underweighted / undervalued and other people's crashes will possibly get more attention.\nIn the short term, one or two errors likely won't make any difference.\nTo figure out the error, you could use the command line to open a test connection to the server indicated in the failure message:\nopenssl s_client -connect radarsubmissions.apple.com:443\n\nSeveral lines of text should flow by if you have no errors or issues.

This means that you can use an unlocked iPhone with any carrier in any country you want.\n\nA: I've visited both countries (and most other European countries) with my iPhone 5s A1530 model (=Asian version) and it works fine.  I worked both with my common simcard as wel as local simcards.  Never had any problem.\nThat being said, I also never had any problems using European, Asian and Australian versions of the iPhone 4, 4s, 5 and 6.  \nAlthough I don't have experience with these, I assume only with phones designed especially for US and China you might have issues in Europe.\n\nA: Look at the model number as printed on the back of the phone, it starts with the letter A and is followed by 4 digits.  \nThe use this table on the apple website to determine carrier compatibility.

And is it possible to have the Messages app synced with the iOS Messages for when I delete a conversation - having it deleted on both?\nThanks!\n\nA: The pref doesn't say \"Save history when you quit or logout\" it says \"Save history when conversations are closed\" - i.e., when you hit the X to get rid of them - either permanently, or temporarily, depending on that pref.\nIf you want to delete the archive itself, you'd have to do that manually.\nFiles live in ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.iChat/Data/Library/Messages\n", "Q: Should i upgrade my 2009 macbookpro components on general way? I've a MacBook Pro (mid 2009), and it has low performance. If I can should I upgrade the memory` and/or a new hard drive or SSD? I don't want to buy another one if my Mac is in perfect condition. \nMy budget for a upgrade is between 300€ and 400€, depending on components suggested.\n\nA: The most important upgrade is making the system drive a Solid State Drive (SSD). This alone may double the effective speed of your computer. Extra RAM is a nice second.\nSince SSDs are usually more expensive than traditional hard drives per GB, you could explore a 'hybrid' drive, though I'd recommend the fastest SSD that your Mac's PCI bus throughput can handle. \nWhen I upgraded my old MacBook Pro (I think it was also a 2009 model), large SSDs were still expensive, so I bought a 128MB SSD for the main system drive and moved the existing HDD into the spot where the Optical Drive was (with a special mounting bracket), and put the Optical Drive in a cheap external USB case. \nI found all the parts on eBay for under $250USD and was honestly shocked at how much faster that MacBook performed.\n\nA: I would always recommend before paying for an upgrade, seeing who would buy your old Mac and for what $$. I tend to upgrade to a new machine far more often since I like to help people get in to a used Mac and support them in getting started.\nThey get a machine from someone that cared for it (original owner) and can get great value in the assistance you provide to help get them set up and answer questions for a short period of time. I would recommend making the support formal and limited and in writing. No sense having hard feelings 6 months down the road.\nWith that information, you can then budget your upgrade knowing it's not better to get a new entry level Mac rather than upgrade only one aspect of an older Mac.\n", "Q: Bash script not found El Capitan I have created a Bash script that simply does ls -l.\nIn Mavericks and older versions of OSX I simply made a symlink to the script and put it in the /usr/bin folder (ln -s ll.sh /usr/bin/ll) and I could then execute the script using ll from any folder.\nSince upgrading to El Capitan I am unable to load this script. I have disabled SIP so that I am able to create the symlink and the script is definitely executable. The location (/usr/bin) is definitely in the $PATH and I have even tried adding a path to the script into the $PATH too.\nNothing seems to work, all I am getting is -bash: ll: command not found.\nI have restarted the terminal after each update to the $PATH and I have tried source ~/.bash_profile but neither are making any difference.\nEdit: I also tried adding the current directory of the scripts to the $PATH and that was also giving the same error. In the end I have aliased all my scripts so that they will run.\n\nA: Just read the comments and see that you're looking for a general solution, rather than that specific example. I'll leave my previous answer in case it helps someone, but here's a more general solution.\nMy first piece of advice: leave /usr/bin alone. There's no reason to mess with it and there are many reasons not to mess with it. Instead, add a directory somewhere else, put you scripts there, and add it to you $PATH variable. If you want this just for your user, you could create a scripts or bin directory in your home directory, or if you want it globally available you could put it under /usr/local, e.g. /usr/local/scripts or /usr/local/bin. Then, in the .bashrc file in your home directory, add the following:\nexport PATH=$PATH:~/scripts:/usr/local/scripts\n\nIf you would rather have your commands override a system command (should they have the same name) then you could do the following, instead:\nexport PATH=~/scripts:/usr/local/scripts:$PATH\n\nIf you want this set for all users, then there is a global /etc/bashrc file that you can add the above to.\nIn order to edit the global bashrc or modify /usr/local you need root/admin privileges.\n\nA: I'm not sure what's wrong with your setup, but a different (perhaps better) way to do this same thing is via Bash's alias command. At the command prompt, type in:\nalias ll=\"ls -l\"\n\nThen you can just type ll and get a full listing. If you wish to make this permanent, you can put it in the .bashrc file in your home directory, which you can create if it doesn't already exist.\n", "Q: Endpoint VPN error Cannot reinstall Endpoint.  Keep getting error: \"Endpoint Security VPN build 860010008 is already installed on this computer\".  How do I uninstall completely to do reinstall?\n\nA: I know this is an old question, but since this is the only one I could find with this problem I'm writing what resolved the problem for me.\nIf you're getting this error, it means that there are files leftover in your system even after deleting the app that make the installer think that the app is still installed on the system.\nOn your terminal, run /Library/Application\\ Support/Checkpoint/Endpoint\\ Connect/Uninstaller. This should completely uninstall all related files and then you can do a fresh installation of the Endpoint Security package.\n", "Q: Untangling iCloud Mess Short story:\nTed owns a company. His company put all employees and owner and owner’s family on a single iCloud account. This brought on several problems including iMessages delivered to wrong devices, among many other issues, but that’s the way it stayed for years. Ted sold company recently and company has allowed him to keep iCloud account. Since then Ted used AppleID website to change the common iCloud email address to a personal account. All other devices are still pointed at old iCloud account.\nMain Goals:\n1. Retain purchases made under common iCloud address.\n2. Fix iMessages wrong-delivery issues.\nI am developing a process to do this, but I don’t have a great deal of confidence in it. \nHere’s a summary of my process. \nOn a phone still tethered to old iCloud address:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go into iCloud settings and sign out.\n\n*Go into App Store and iTunes and sign out.\n\n*Go into Messages and Sign Out.\n\n*Create new iCloud address under iCloud settings and confirm via email.\n\n*Sign in in AppStore, iTunes, and iMessage.\n\n*Confirm all bad addresses and phone numbers are not referenced in iMessages.\n\n*Open contacts and make sure there are no references to old iCloud email address.\n\n*On Ted’s phone, set up Family Sharing and connect to address created in step 4. \n\n\nWhat else could I be doing to help this along? Or is there an easier way?\n\nA: This is a common engagement that I see and there is really no way to untangle purchases going forward.\nThe main thing to focus on in my experience is if you can edit the AppleID or not. If the account in question is @icloud.com, @me.com or @mac.com - it's set in stone and you can't really repurpose it.\nIf the AppleID is not using an Apple extension, then you have much more flexibility to rename the actual AppleID and update all the security, recovery and primary emails and convert a \"personal\" account to a \"role/work\" account and the other way.\nWhen looking at the value of purchases, also consider the billable rate and the time spend not doing other work. Often it's simpler to write off the loss of past purchases and just make a clean break. Putting humpty dumpty back together again isn't viable in most cases.\nSpecifically:\n\n\n*\n\n*retaining purchases - no go since they stay with the account and you can't use one Apple ID for that many devices without Apple eventually shutting it down.\n\n*fixing iMessage - this is doable. It is a lot of work, but you can plan that work on a piece of paper and then decide if it's really worth it to try and reuse one Apple ID or if you will just make a new account and use that going forward with a complete wipe of all the \"wrongly configured\" devices.\n\n\nAgain, get an estimate of how much your time is worth and how much time the people using the devices is work and solve your particular situation for the lowest $$ invested.\n", "Q: Get my photos on all my devices I want all my photos from icloud to appear on all my devices. I've turned on icloud onto all my devices but they are all out of sync. This is quite strange, is this expected behaviour?\nI've read I might need to enable photo stream but not only is it not clear what photo stream is but it also seems to have limitations, for example, it is limited in how many it can sync.\nWith google photo is syncs and stores all my photos in the cloud and shows me all the photos on all my devices. Is there no such thing for apple?\n\nA: You want to enable photo stream, and really every kind of sharing there is.  I personally don't use iCloud for photo sync, but instead I use DropBox with Carousel.  The reason for this is that Carousel has a much simpler interface, and automatically takes care of all syncing (provided you use the Carousel app for viewing photos).  You also can have more space to store (1TB or more depending on your plan, as much as 50GB for the free plan, depending on what you've done in it - I have 8GB)\n", "Q: Not enough storage space to update iPad mini I don't have enough storage space to update my iPad mini  from iOS 7 to iOS 9. As advised I have linked to MacBook Pro through Bluetooth but cannot see what the next step should be. I have little IT knowledge so answers need to be idiot proof.\n\nA: Since iOS 9 is smaller in file size than iOS 7, you can just delete a few songs or podcasts or apps, whatever is taking up space, then install iOS 9, then re-download whatever you deleted. This can be a bit faster than restoring from backup, although it is still a good idea to back up your iPad!\n\nA: *\n\n*Back up your iOS device to iCloud and to iTunes (just in case one doesn't work).\n\n*Open settings app and reset the device. Choose erase all content and settings.\n\n*Then when you get the setup assistant, set this up as a new device. Skip all the optional steps (decline to sign in, set up voiceover, siri, etc... especially iCloud - skip that so you don't make a new backup the overwrites the one with your data. Also use care connecting to iTunes that you don't overwrite your backup there.\n\n*Once the iPad is updated, do the erase all content and settings a second time and this time choose to restore from your original backup.\n\n\nA: First of all, check usage in the iPad settings app and see what's eating your space.\nVideos are huge. Delete a couple of minutes and you open up quite a bit.\nDon't forget the messages kind of apps, if you send/receive many photos, Emojies, vids, etc, in these sort of apps they grow pretty large. Delete a couple of conversations.\nThen: connecting with a Lightning cable is hugely faster than Bluetooth. When you open iTunes with the iPad connected it will tell you there's an upgrade and tell you what to do. Upgrading through iTunes will also need less space than over the air (OTA). At least it did with 8.0.\n", "Q: Switch tabs in Safari - Shortcut (⌘ + ⌥ + Arrow) I would like to know if there is a way to switch tabs in Safari with the shortcut used in Chrome (⌘ + ⌥ + Arrow).\nRight now with OS X El Capitan, you can switch between tabs but just up to the 9th one with ⌘ + number.\nI find it way much easier to switch tabs with the arrows compared to the numbers plus you can get to all the tabs instead of the nine first ones.\n\nA: You can use ctrl + tab to switch to the next tab (equivalent to ⌘ + ⌥ + >) and ctrl + shift + tab to switch to the previous tab (equivalent to ⌘ + ⌥ + <).\nYou can use this on Safari, Chrome and Firefox, basically with any app that has tabs.\n\nA: Go to system preference > keyboard > Shortcuts. Choose \"App shortcuts\" then press the + button. You can add a shortcut to Safari by selecting it, type the exact command you want as it appears in the menu \"Show Previous Tab\" then enter the shortcut you want.\n", "Q: Could I revert system to Yosemite by using TimeMachine backup, after upgrading system to El Capitan? I'm considering upgrading system to El Capitan, but I have a lot of apps that could not work on new system. I have to check it by installing new system. I wonder if that apps would not work properly could I revert system to Yosemite by using TimeMachine backup, after upgrading system to El Capitan? Or it'll revert only files but on new system version? \nHow does it work?\nIt's critical for me, because I'm working on this apps. If I wouldn't be able to run them I'm dead.\n\nA: Yes, you can easily go back to a previous version of os x if you have correctly saved that version using time machine. \nYou'll need to : \n\n\n*\n\n*connect the time machine to your mac\n\n*Restart your mac and hold Command + R\n\n*After the mac boots go to OS X Utilities and select Restore from a Time Machine Backup then hit next or continue\n\n*A screen will show Select a backup source select your time machine bacup\n\n*You will have next a screen with OS X Version and Backup Date and Time, If you want to go back to Yosemite select 10.10.X (Mavericks is 10.9.X)\n\n\nA: You can reinstall Yosemite and restore from backup, but most likely these apps will have updates available in the next month or awhile, unless they're noname publishers.  Depending on the app, there are some workarounds.  What apps are you trying to run?\nSHORT ANSWER: YES.  Just reinstall and restore.\n", "Q: How to stream music to a PC?

It works fine attached to a wall charger. Plugging in the USB cable into laptop doesn't generate an audible feedback. I am running Windows 8.1 Professional. \nHow do I solve my problem?\n\nA: This can have 2 reasons\n1. You're using an aftermarket cable with too much electrical loss.\n2. Your laptop USB port(s) don't deliver enough power.\nBoth situations sometimes are paired with the iPhone making non stop charge-beeps like you connect and disconnect the charging cable - but I read that this is not the case with you.\nI found out that this situation comes up less frequently, once the iPhone battery is above 70 or so percent.\n\nA: I have the same problem, it did charge once on my laptop but it didn't again after that...

Hopefully not necessary and Disk Utility will sort you out ;-)\n\nA: I think it's your adaptor's fault.  It's most likely not Mac friendly (aka no drivers).  Try out a Windows machine.\n", "Q: AirPort Extreme Roaming Network I'm regularly hosting gaming events for medium-sized groups of 50-100 people. So far, players typically used personal hotspots to connect to the Internet. However, I would like to fix this with an AirPort Extreme setup. Before I purchase the equipment, I would like to answer some questions.\nThe target setup consists of two AirPort Extremes wired together to create a giant WiFi.\n\n\n*\n\n*Do the two AirPorts create a shared subnet where every client can see each other?\n\n\n*\n\n*If yes, what's the maximum size of that subnet? Is it just a 192.168.0.x one with 255 max-clients, or can you go bigger?\n\n\n*If people move from one AirPort to the other one, will they keep the same local IP?\n\n*Does AirPort Extreme support UDP broadcasting?\n\n\n*\n\n*If yes, do these UDP broadcasts work between the AirPorts as well? i.e. if one client is connected through the first AirPort, and the other client is connected through the second AirPort, will they see mutual UDP broadcasts?\n\n\n*Each AirPort Extreme is advertised to handle up to 50 clients. Does this mean that I have to place the routers in a way that roughly halve of my people are in range of the first AirPort and the other halve is closer to the second one? Or will the connections automatically be balanced between AirPorts?\n\nA: In 2020 - get a Dream Machine if you can. The software does all this automagically. Then add AP as needed to complete your coverage based on your measured quality and channel needs.\n\nYour question is probably too broad, but a pair of recent 802.11ac AirPort extremes might actually run well with 50 clients. I would get a third for 75+ or if your clients aren't on 802.11 AC substitute 2 Express for each one Extreme to get adequate bandwidth over WiFi.\n\n*\n\n*Don't place them all together on one table. The closer they are to the external walls of the room, the better your interference situation will be.\n\n*Do link them with cat 5e or better ethernet cable\n\n*The one connected to the internet is the router and you'll have plenty of reservations out of the box.\n\n*Set the rest up in bridge mode.\n\n*Run a wireless scan using airport utility on iOS or get a Mac program like WiFi Explorer so you can assign channels manually and troubleshoot things like spectrum noise to signal and channel overlap and utilization.\n\n*If all of your clients are Mac and iOS, and if you place the base stations equally around the space,  toggling Wi-Fi off and on on the clients should do an acceptable job of balancing the load and matching each client to the closest base station\n\n*I would probably make different SSID for both 2.4 and 5 GHz and for each base station. You can make the password the same for all of them in that way if you need to go in and read distribute things you can.\n\nIf you set things up as I have described, you can choose and arbitrarily large pool of IP addresses, devices will retain the same IP address in general, UDP broadcast won't be a problem.\n\nSet up the first Airport Extreme with Channel 11 and Channel 36\nThe rest go in bridge mode:\n\n*\n\n*channel 6 and 153\n\n*channel 1 and 161\n\n*channel 11 and 157 (note 11 overlaps with the first - so make sure this is quite far from the first base station)\n\nAvoid channel 149 since it's used initially for AirDrop/AirPlay. Don't use any channels other than 1, 6 and 11 on 2.4 GHz. If you have more complicated wifi planning needs, get a tool like wifi explorer to actually measure your network conditions in real time.\n\nA: What I would do here is get an Airport Express rather than a second Extreme.  The Express can be configured to just repeat the WiFi rather than giving a second network.  If you wanted to use an Airport Extreme, you could do this:\n(From https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202056)\nRoaming Network (Ethernet-connected Wi-Fi base stations)\n\nFor 802.11n Wi-Fi base stations, creating a roaming network is by far the best choice. This will provide the best throughput between the base stations and your Wi-Fi devices.\nThis set up requires that your Wi-Fi base stations are connected via Ethernet.\nThe primary base station provides DHCP Services, while the extended base station will be configured to use bridge mode.\nAll Wi-Fi base stations within the roaming network should use the same passwords, security type (Open/WEP/WPA), and network name (SSID).\nYou can add several extended Wi-Fi base stations to expand a roaming network.\nYou can incorporate a network switch if you don’t have enough LAN ports available on your primary Wi-Fi base station.\n", "Q: Is there a way to access and view/modify APN settings on IOS 9.0.2 Is there a way to access and view/modify APN settings on IOS 9.0.2\nPreviously, I had iOS 8.4 installed on my iPhone and I was able to access and modify the APN settings by going to: \n\nSettings > General > Cellular > Cellular Data\n\nI currently have no way to modify or even view the APN settings after upgrading to 9.0.2 and the cellular data menu is gone, but I did switch to AT&T recently as well so I'm not sure if the APN settings were removed in 9.0.2, if using an AT&T SIM hides the cellular data/APN menu, or if that menu/option is hidden somewhere else altogether.\n\nA: Bad news... good news.\nBad news... cellular APN settings are disabled on by carrier and/or iOS 9.\nGood news... you can create the appropriate APN settings profile via your mobile browser of choice at unlockit.co.nz\nJust select your country/carrier and tap Create APN, follow the prompts and that's it.\n", "Q: How to restore the iPhone as a new phone with the same OS version?

I'm pretty fluent in the basics of web based languages i.e., HTML(5), CSS(3), php, MySQL, Javascript; although now I'm diving deeper and starting to tackle scripting (Mostly Python and Ruby) & compiler code (Objective-C, Cocoa, Swift, Metal).\nWhat do you some of you recommend for someone who is embarking upon the higher tiers of programming, such as the ones I mentioned above (IMHO; no offense to web dev gurus ;-) ); should I use the basic text editor & up (BBEdit, TextWrangler, ATOM, Sublime Text) and create my own file hierarchy by hand, or should I learn with the assistance of an IDE like Xcode, Dreamweaver, Eclipse (I know it's java based, and rather not use on OS X just from hearing word of mouth), or is there any others that I don't even have any prior knowledge/experience with? If you prefer not to utilize IDE's what is your favorite syntax highlighting enabled text/file editor? \nI know this may seem like a novice question, but I'm a \"measure twice, cut once\" kind of guy. Yet, don't let that confuse you with my expectations, because I know what a headache debugging can be, especially when you're twenty or so versions already down the line, and are now establishing a small to medium sized user base, and people are posting support comments/inquiries on your software's Git page/repository, and you're beginning to run out of answers... \n:-O\n\nA: I have broken down this into several parts:\nFor Scripting Languages\n\n\n\n*\n\n*IDLE... It sucks!\n\n*Edit it any one of the text editors (your choice, but i suggest sublime or brackets) and the run in terminal\n\n*Use something like pycharm, it is a nice cross between something like xcode and just a text editor\nFor Programming Languages\n\n\n\n*\n\n*For languages like Obj-C, C and C++ you have a couple of options like Codeblocks, Xcode and Eclipse. With Codeblocks, people either hate it or love it (I hate it). Eclipse is versatile but clunky, and Xcode... Xcode I really enjoy it, it is cool, easy-to-use and fun. Probably just starting out, go with Xcode.\n\n*For languages like swift, you have not many choices but Xcode.\n\nComparisons\n\nScripting Language Editors\nIdle: Simple. Limited options and customization.\nSublime Text 2/3: More complex. Tons of extensions and customizations.\nBrackets: Simple but complex. tons of themes. Still very new.\nAtom: Large app size. Nice looking. Has a sublime-esk.\nProgramming Language IDE's\nXcode: Easy to use. tons of support. Large community.\nCodeblocks: Clunky. * opinion * bad GUI. Has been around for a while.\nEclipse: Versatile, old,large community.\nConclusion\n\nIn the end, this question, boils down to opinion. What do you find is good? \nFor me I use brackets and sublime for scripting, and Xcode for programming.\nFor you as a beginner, start by looking at sublime text 2 or 3 and Xcode.\n", "Q: Apple iMac powermac 6.1 How Come my old iMac Powermac 6.1 isn't recognized by my iPhone 4s ? and how do I connect my mobile hotspot from my T-Mobile iPhone 4s to my old iMac Power Mac 6.1? I try to just plug it in with the USB cable but the iMac seems to not recognize it at all . \n\nA: The best answer is provided by https://discussions.apple.com/docs/DOC-6021.  This explains the maximum version of OS X which is supported by your particular system (10.5.8), as well as the maximum version of iOS which your phone can be in order to be recognised by the computer (iOS 5.x and earlier).  If you are able to meet both these conditions, you should be able to connect the phone to your computer and have it recognised (which should be the condition needed to start network sharing via USB).\nIt will also depend as to whether you have the optional Airport card installed in the mac, or the optional Bluetooth capability, as this will help you with your network sharing options from your iPhone.\nIf you've got a version of iOS on your phone that is 6.x or later, then you're probably out of luck for being able to get the phone and computer to talk to each other effectively as there's no real downgrade path available.\n", "Q: Would it work using Time Capsule both as Time Machine AND media container? I currently have a Macbook Pro and Time Capsule 3TB (ac-wifi).\nThe easiest solution for me would be to use the TC for both media storage AND backups via Time Machine. \nWould this be possible?\nI am thinking that the system could be \"confused\" loading down photos from TC to Macbook, and at the same time making backups with those same files from Macbook to TC. \nI also read that OS X Photos and similar don't work well with external drives.\nCan someone please bring light to this subject for me?\nThanks!\n\nA: You can setup your AirPort Time Capsule to be a file server.  Just create several folders or as you require.  Use port forwarding in the Airport side to forward your WAN or internet connection to the Time Capsule side.  Use DynDNS to setup an account and then connect from anywhere in the world where the internet is not censored.  You will want excellent security configured for the AP Time Capsule if you go this route.\nOr you can just use the Back to Mac function that is available through iCloud and is native to OS X.\n\nA: There was a time I used my TC for TM and storage.  The TC is essentially a shared disk and TM backups are just plain accessible directories showing up in your finder, the same way as they would show up on a normal USB drive with TM activated on it.  However TCs are not very known for breaking speed records.  I have since switched to iCloud storage and use the TM only as wifi access point.\nFor the storage part I used both normal storage and a couple sparse images I created in Disk Utitlity.  One for iTunes, one for Photos, etc.\nWhile the iTunes disk is quite forgiving when starting up without mounting the image first (iTunes will complain it couldn't find the last known library and give you an option to fix it), Photos.app is not.\nChances are you're not always connected to your home network and, when you're back, chances are your Mac won't see the TC right away after connecting to your Wifi.  Photos.app eventually will catch up automatically, but not without giving you random punishes along the line.  \nPhotos.app gives you the option to store lower resolution pics on your iOS devices, but stores full resolution pics on the Mac.\nYes indeed there is an option that says \"Optimize Mac Storage\" but the fineprint under it says \"Store full-resolution photos and videos in iCloud. Originals will also be stored on this Mac if you have enough storage\".  Apple understands that people have multiple iOS devices.  They don't see to understand others also have multiple Macs.\nBottom line:  If you're up for a frustrating ride, store your photos on your TC - in either way (direct of sparse images).  Using external USB3.0 drives instead is not ideal either, but at least it will save you a lot of time.\n", "Q: Changing Input Language in iOS 9 with External Keyboard When using an external keyboard, is there a new key combination to change the input language?

I have a certain location on my screen that I would like to take a screenshot of rather frequently for a project.  Is there a way to set a key binding that would allow one to press a certain combination of keys that will grab that region and output it to a PNG?\n\nA: You can now do this natively, Apple added to the previous capture commands of  Cmd ⌘   Shift ⇧   3  and  Cmd ⌘   Shift ⇧   4   by adding  Cmd ⌘   Shift ⇧   5  [This functionality was added in Mojave.]\nThis exposes all the preferences for the Screenshot process right there on screen. If you select a specific area, then it will return to this same area [& selected Preferences in the Options button] every time you trigger it, until you change it. You take the shot with the Capture button, or Return/Enter key. It will otherwise wait for you. You can also add a timer, change location, etc that you previously had to access from terminal.\n\nI've manipulated the window position in this capture so you can see both in the same shot.\nBTW, you can screenshot the screenshot mechanism using Cmd/Shift/3\n\nA: Keyboard Maestro can do this with a macro such as…\n               \n\nA: This is quite easy to do.\nThe Built in Screencapture has a command line option to capture a rect area.

I dropped it and now it occasionally makes a grinding sound from the left rear of the machine: it sounds like something physically grinding against something else.  Oddly, if I squeeze the case when it is making the grinding sound, the sound stops.  There's no apparent correlation between when the sound starts and what activities I'm performing.  Looking at a teardown of the 2014 MBA, it looks like the fan might be located there, but I can't tell if anything else is in that area.\nHow would I go about diagnosing the cause of the sound?\n\nA: In most cases your Mac will cool itself down by passive airflow, but when things get too hot, the fan will spin up to get the excessive heat out.\nChances are that the drop caused a minor bend in the casing.  While you might not see any damage with the naked eye,the MBA is engineered at micron level and there's little room for any \"unnatural\" dimension changes.\nHowever you might be (arguably) lucky, and the drop might have damaged the fan closure or fan blades.  The fan is fairly easily replacable at Apple Service, the casing will be less replacable (or too expensive to do so).\nI think it's time to get your Apple Care plan executed, or to give your insurance agent a call.\n", "Q: What apps use ~/.bash_profile?

I synced their photos via iCloud but I don't like photo stream because if you delete a photo on one device you delete from all. And I've already lost things I didn't want to that way. so I want to just turn off iCloud for photos and sync manually. If I turn off photo stream, could I lose photos? I've also synced my devices manually, not just via photo stream. Does that make a difference?\n\nA: Short answer: No, you won't lose your photos.\nSolution: For free and complete syncing, the only way to go is to turn off iCloud Photo Library and My Photo Stream and stick with manual wired or WiFi syncing. It's very important to remember to turn off My Photo Stream as well if you're choosing this option. Otherwise your photos will duplicate.\nDetails:\nTurning off photo stream will not make you lose your photos. It will only disable the Photo Stream function, which is mostly comprised of the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*It sends optimized (device specific) versions of the photos you take to every Photo Stream enabled device.\n\n*It includes the last 1000 photos you've taken, or the last 30 days of photos, which ever is greater.\n\n*Data from Photo Stream is a one time push only, meaning it won't push again if you delete a photo from your Photo Stream.\n\n*It does not take up iCloud photo space (contrary to most people's opinion). It is a separate and completely free service within the iOS/Mac ecosystem.\n\n\nWhen you say iPhone 7, I'm assuming you're talking about iOS 7. In iOS 8.3 and above, iCloud Photo Library (if turned on) replaces the need for Photo Stream, although Photo Stream is still available.\nUsing iCloud Photo Library is great if you have tons of space in the cloud, since it syncs your albums, edits, share activity... pretty much everything. SERIOUSLY, it's sweet as sugar. BUT, realistically, you will only have that kind of storage space if you pay for it; most likely, you'll run out of your free 5GB allotment since it backs everything up.\nIf you don't mind paying, it's a great solution. But you want to go completely free, stay away from it like the plague.\nHere's a great article that explains iCloud Photo Library in excellent and digestible detail: https://tidbits.com/article/15584\n", "Q: Has El Capitan Disk Utility Removed Encryption Options?

(Recovering data from a Mac floppy.) I've been tasked with the job of recovering the text of a book stored on a 3.5'' floppy disk. From what I can tell, the book was stored on the disk using a Mac sometime in the 1990s.\nI tried simply reading the disk on my older Windows machine, but I received the error: \"The disk is not formatted\". I tried using several file recovery programs, but they mostly indicated that the disk was probably corrupt.\nHowever, I was able to create an .IMA disk image file in Windows. I transferred this file to my newer PC and opened it was a text editor. It seems that the text of the book is intact, but it is mixed in with many formatting characters that I think are an artifact of some old Mac word processor. For example I think Ü ┐Ü represents a line break.\nIs there any (PC) software I can use to parse out all of theses formatting symbols? Or better yet, is there software that could perhaps understand the original format that the book was written in? Unfortunately I do not have a single file, instead it's trapped in a disk image. (And I am not able to extract the disk image because the disk is \"corrupt.\") I could manually go through and edit the text, but this would be extremely time consuming, considering that the book is ~1 MB.\nThanks!\n\nA: Best guess with no additional information would be that it is a ClarisWorks file.\nLibreOffice should be able to open it - the translation is apparently not perfect, but might be good enough to work with.\nIdea garnered from How to open your ClarisWorks files for a stroll down memory lane\nThere's also the possibility of extracting the files directly from the floppy to Windows using MacDrive or even MacDisk (though that looks pretty old) rather than trying to pick bits out of a WinImage file.\n", "Q: Need script to automatically export Skim PDFs with embedded notes I have a folder with a few thousand PDF files, most of which have Skim annotations (e.g., highlights and notes). If I had fewer files, I'd just go through each one, export the PDF with embedded notes, and be on my merry way, having the ability to read my annotations with Adobe Reader on a PC (this is the goal). \nBut since there are so many files, I need a script that will automatically go through this folder, perform the \"export as PDF with embedded notes\" function for each PDF that has Skim annotations, and then give the new file the name of the original file plus \"with skim notes\" (or some other designation to indicate it's the version with embedded notes). Secondly, if I make further annotations to the original PDF, it'd be great if the script could update the exported file with the embedded notes.\nI assume this is possible, as it appears Skim has great applescript support, but I have no idea  how to create one.\nThank you so much for any help you can offer.\nWG\n\nA: I had the same problem and wanted to batch embed a lot of skim pdfs. The apple script by Jess Riedel wasn't working for me, so I coded a python script to do the job.\nI used the script to embed 568 pdfs scattered in a folder with various subfolders. It took 300 seconds. Be aware, that the script won't process files with a \" in its filepath.\nIt is possible to create an osx folder action that runs the script on changed files in a folder automatically, every time a file changes. I haven't developed one yet because I havent found any need for it.\nYou can download the script as an osx service and as an alfred workflow at https://github.com/alexandergogl/SkimPDF.\n# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-\n\nfrom os import system, walk, path\n\n\nclass SkimPDF(object):\n    \"\"\"docstring for SkimPDF.\"\"\"\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.skimpdf_path = '/Applications/Skim.app/Contents/SharedSupport/skimpdf'\n        self.embed_suffix = '_embeded'\n        self.replace = False\n        pass\n\n    def embed_notes(self, in_pdf):\n        \"\"\"Embed skim notes to PDF.\"\"\"\n        if self.replace is False:\n            out_pdf = \"%s%s.pdf\" % (in_pdf[:-4], self.embed_suffix)\n        else:\n            out_pdf = in_pdf\n\n        # Embed notes\n        cmd = '%s embed \"%s\" \"%s\"' % (self.skimpdf_path, in_pdf, out_pdf)\n        result = system(cmd)\n\n        # Compose message\n        if result == 0:\n            message = \"Embeded notes to '%s'\" % in_pdf\n        else:\n            message = result\n\n        return message\n\n    def embed_notes_batch(self, folder):\n        \"\"\"Loop through directories in given folder and embed notes.\"\"\"\n        messages = []\n        i = 0\n        for path, subdirs, files in walk(folder):\n            for name in files:\n                if name.endswith(\".pdf\"):\n                    i += 1\n                    # embed notes to pdf\n                    pdf_file = \"%s/%s\" % (path, name)\n                    result = skim.embed_notes(pdf_file)\n                    # add result message to report\n                    messages.append(result)\n                    # report current state\n                    print(i)\n\n        self.report(messages)\n        pass\n\n    def report(self, messages):\n        \"\"\"Print list of processed pdfs.\"\"\"\n        print(\"\\n\\nProcessing PDFs done:\")\n\n        for i in range(len(messages)):\n            message = \"%s: %s\" % (i + 1, messages[i])\n            print(message)\n        pass\n\n\nskim = SkimPDF()\nskim.replace = True  # set to false if you want a copy in place instead\n# skim.embed_suffix = '_embeded'  # uncomment and enter your own suffix if necessary\n\n# embed notes of a single pdf\nskim.embed_notes('../path/to/pdf file.pdf')\n\n# batch embeding process with path to folder with literature\nskim.embed_notes_batch('../path/to/Literature folder')\n\n\nA: This is the method I used on my entire Zotero library (~3GB of PDFs).  Note that the only annotations I use are highlighting (single color) and comments.  Whether or not this successfully converts more complicated annotations depends on the detail of the skimembed script, which I don't know much about.\nWhat worked\nThe original skimembed script converts a single PDF with skim annotations (which are in the form of \"extended attributed\") to a single PDF with embedded annotations.  It is a shell script you run from the command line (terminal) using this notation\nsh skimembed pdf_with_skim_annotations.pdf\n\nor more generally\nsh /path/to/scripts/folder/skimembed /path/to/pdf/folder/pdf_with_skim_annotations.pdf\n\nHere, sh is the shell program you use to interpret the script skimembed.  This script basically is just an automated way of using File > Export...PDF with embedded notes from the Skim menu.  However, it does not make a second copy of the pdf; the new version replaces it and has the same name.\nI then Googled around for a shell script that lets you apply skimembed recursively to all pdf files in a folder (including subfolders):\n#!/bin/bash \nfind $1 -type f -name \"*.pdf\" | while read f ; do\n sh /path/to/scripts/filder/skimembed \"$f\"\ndone\n\nHere, $1 denotes the path to a folder, the first (and only) argument this script expects to receive.  The find command returns all normal (-type f) files in that folder with the pdf ending (name \"*.pdf\").  The results are piped (|)  to a while loop indexed by f.  \nI saved the above text in a file called recursiveskiembed.sh and then ran\nsh recursiveskiembed.sh /path/to/pdfs/folder\n\nIn my case, the folder I choose was /Users/username/Library/Application Support/Zotero/Profiles/xxx123.default/zotero/storage.  This takes every single PDF with Skim annotations in the folder and replaces them with normal, embedded PDF annotations.\nWhat didn't work\nI tried the user-submitted Skim scripts and in particular the skimalot script (which is a successor to skimembed) and the FilingEagle script and some other. But I couldn't get any of them to work.  (Note that the sugarsync.com hosted files are dead links now.)  Likewise, the half dozen AppleScript scripts always seem to fail with completely inscrutable errors.\nThe clobbergaurd script is supposed to check a large directory for filenames that differ only in ending to prevent you from overwriting stuff using skimalot, but I couldn't get it work.  (The sugarsync link is dead, but a Google search turned up this Dropbox copy.)  So I just backed up my zotero library and I crossed my fingers.\n\nA: I have uploaded a script, which contains a command-line utility downloaded from skim, and uses this code (note, it won't work without the utility!):\non open dropped_files\n    set app_path to POSIX path of (path to me)\n    repeat with current_file in dropped_files\n        do shell script quoted form of (app_path & \"Contents/Resources/skimpdf\") & \" embed \" & quoted form of POSIX path of current_file & \" \" & quoted form of (((characters 1 through -5 of (POSIX path of current_file as string)) as string) & \" with skim notes.pdf\")\n    end repeat\nend open\n\nYou can download it from here. Drag all the PDFs (the files, not the folder) onto the droplet extracted from the zip file, and it should convert everything almost instantly!\nNote: You'll have to right-click the app and open it once from the Finder, in order to bypass the \"unknown developer\" warning, and use the droplet. After that, you'll be all set!\n", "Q: Mac won’t display WiFi login box after upgrade to El Capitan I don’t know if the upgrade to El Capitan is relevant or not, but lately I’ve noticed I can’t connect to the Internet via public WiFi hotspots with my MacBook Pro.\nI can connect to WiFi networks themselves and say, my home WiFi network that requires a WPA password. But now when I connect to public WiFi hotspots I no longer get the modal window that usually asks me to log in using my account with that provider.\nIs this a setting or something that may have been disabled in El Capitan? If so, how can I get my Mac to display those modals again? (I don’t even know what they’re called so not sure what search terms to use.) \n\nA: My fix was very simple. I removed the hard coded DNS entries I had setup. 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4 which I believe are Google DNS servers. Hope this helps someone.\n\nA: for me this trick always worked - even on the iphone!\nBrowse directly to the log in screen: http://captive.apple.com/hotspot-detect.html\n\nA: I had this problem with a fresh install of OS X El Capitan. I had to create a new standard user (not admin) and log in as that to get my public internet login page. Returning to admin subsequently has restored the Wi-Fi like normal. A bug surely.\nP.S. Found that workaround at: https://discussions.apple.com/message/29042350#29042350\n\nA: I resolved this issue by removing my custom DNS entries. I prefer to use Google Public DNS and this was disrupting the login screen.\nI discovered the issue by running the Network Diagnostics app after experiencing this problem on a recently upgraded MBP Retina (Yosemite -> El Capitan). To run the app, do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open System Preferences\n\n*Choose Network\n\n*Click Assist me...\n\n*Click Diagnostics...\n\n*When the app starts, choose Wi-Fi and Continue\n\n*Troubleshoot any issues the app reports (your issues might be different than mine)\n\n\nA: After searching for hours, this solution worked:  Resolving Stubborn Wi-Fi Connection Problems in Mac OS X\nTo summarize, turn your WiFi off, then move the following files to a folder on your Desktop (for example).\n/Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/com.apple.airport.preferences.plist\n\n/Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/com.apple.network.identification.plist\n\n/Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/NetworkInterfaces.plist\n\n/Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/preferences.plist\n\nThen reboot, turn your WiFI back on, connect to the network, and the login dialog box should pop up. For me, the second listed above did not exist, so I just moved the other 3. If this works for you, you can delete the files that you moved.\n\nA: I had this exact same problem and after a lot of trial and error this worked for me:-\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Network Preferences\n\n*Turn Wi-Fi off\n\n*Turn Wi-Fi back on\n\n*Before the network 'joins' the network manually select it form the Network Name dropdown \n\n*For me this finally caused the pop-up to appear\n\n\nSounds like voodoo - no idea why this worked, but it did!\n\nA: I had the same problem. I tried every option that has been stated in this section but it still didn't work, then from a different forum someone said try typing www.apple.com and it worked just fine. Not sure if its a long term fix but the pop up login screen did eventually pop up.\nHope this helps\n\nA: I think the modal (login) window is just loading a web page. Most of the time, if you are connected to the wifi network but you still have to login using the modal window, if you type something in the address bar, you get redirected to a login page. This also happens on my phone, but I need to have mobile data turned off, or the browser will load the page using mobile data.\nIf you do not get redirected for some reason, if you know the address of the page you are supposed to be redirected to, entering this manually sometimes works for me.\nIf you can manage to get redirected in the browser of your phone, you can simply enter this address on your computer as well. This worked for me just now, I had to copy an address like http://10.19.0.1:3442. The url was actually longer, but only this first part was needed. This successfully brought me to the page where I could enter the wifi password. Somehow I had to turn wifi off and on after that (this didn't work before), but I did not have to re-enter the password fortunately.\n\nA: *\n\n*Remove the Wifi Network\n\n*Join it again\n\n*When it asks for credentials, make sure to turn off the option to remember the login.\n\n\nFunny thing is that it does not go through the logon screen doing so, just the modal dialog box is displayed.\nNot having looked into the details, I assume that a new logon token needs to be generated, and the remembered logon is just no good.\nAnother option that seems to work for me is starting up Firefox instead. Either it will come-up with a login screen, or in the banner it will instruct that a logon first might be required (clicking the button/link in the banner will redirect to the logon screen)\n\nA: I had the same problem even on Sierra when I tried to login to public network. Network \"Assist me...\" didn't do the work for me. In fact, it reported the network connection was ok. I need to click the \"Advanced\" in Network settings and DNS tab. Hit the link under Search Domain in browser and the term page eventually showed up. \n\nA: This blog was helpful when I ran into this issue today.\nIn particular flushing the DNS cache, then reconnecting WiFi solved it:\nsudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder\n\n\nAlso I have seen the WiFi login dialog suppressed when running VPN software.  I regularly use Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client.  Even if this is in Disconnected state, just having it running can prevent a WiFi login dialog.  So:\n\n*\n\n*Quit Cisco AnyConnect\n\n*Turn off WiFi\n\n*Turn on WiFi - hopefully now the WiFi login dialog will appear - enter normal details\n\n*Restart Cisco AnyConnect and connect to VPN as required\n\n", "Q: iPod touch 4th gen dead I got this iPod touch 4th gen today. It worked initially but in between it showed a few weird screens and turned off and it would start again immediately. I thought if I would update this from iOS 5 to iOS 6 that would solve the problem. So I plugged it into my computer (Windows 7) and tried to update it from iOS 5 to iOS 6. Everything went well but at the end it returned error 1600 due to which the update was unsuccessful. Since then, the iPod has not started, nor is it charging. It just gets heated up when I plug it into the charger. It doesn't show any sign of charging. If I hold the sleep/wake button and home button together even for 60s it won't respond. It only gets recognized by iTunes that too with the same message \"iTunes has detected an iPod in recovery mode. You must restore this iPod before it can be used with iTunes\". I try to restore iPod and it shows error 1600 and I again get into the same cycle.\nAny help will be appreciated. I have wasted the past 5 hours over this.\n\nA: Error 1600 would appear to be a USB connectivity error\nFrom Get help with iOS update and restore errors\n\nCheck your USB connections\nErrors: 13, 14, 1600, 1601, 1602, 1603, 1604, 1611, 1643-1650, 2000,\n  2001, 2002, 2005, 2006, 2009, 4005, 4013, 4014.

I was forced to restart but I couldn't pass by this screen.\n\nI tried everything. Resetting PRAM, checking disk in Single User Mode (sbin/fsck -fy), I was able to mount a drive and back up my data. Sometimes, I was able to boot normally, but I had the same issue again after a while. Finally, after many attempts, I was able to boot in recovery disk and reformat my os, I did a clean install. At first it seemed to work fine and I upgraded, all happily, to El Capitan.\nWhile still testing the Mac if was working properly, I had the same issues again. Now, no matter what I try, it refuses to do anything except Single User Mode.\nWhat's wrong? Is it the logic board? Is there something I can do? Unfortunately, Genius Bar is not an option as I moved away from uk.\n\nA: The problem was solved by replacing the logic board. I went to a local merchant who complies with Apple, and they told me they will replace it for free. After being pressed by its customers (in US) who were complaining for this issue and even sued the company, Apple filed an issue for free replacements during the last five years.\nMore info here and

issue that I have. There was a batch of faulty logic boards in the mid 2010 MacBook Pro. Apple replaced the Logic boards in faulty MBPs free of charge at the time, but unfortunately their offer only lasted for MBPs reported to them within 3 years of purchase. Like yourself, my MBP only started showing the problem after the 3 years were up.\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/4152749?tstart=0\nThe issue is due to the automatic switching between the intel GPU and the Nvidia GPU. \nThe only way I've found to live with the issue is to install gfxCardStatus and lock my graphics card to the intel GPU. Others have a little more success and are able to lock their GPU to the Nvidia chip and suffer the battery life drop. Mileage seems to vary with the solution.\nYou could try contacting Apple and beg them to fix the logic board for you as it is a known issue, but I've no idea how you'll get on as their replacement program ended a while back.\n\nA: The gfx card status will only work with this version 1.8.1\nhttps://software.com/mac/apps/gfxcardstatus/1.8.1\n", "Q: Simulating a touch on a phone screen without a finger? I'm trying to simulate a touch on my iPhone without actually touching it (with a finger) for an app I'm making, I already tried electricity and it didn't worked, what is the correct way of doing it?\nedit: I'm trying to simulate a touch physically, I need to understand the touch screen mechanism to find some sort of material.\n\nA: Apple's screens are capacitive touch so you would need to have a 3D servo mechanism to move a sausage or one of those gloves with touch material weaved in to them.\nMany food stuffs that contain water (sausage, snacks, string cheese) would work as well if you don't want to spend money on a device engineered to work with capacitive screens for whatever reason. \nProgrammatically, you would want to connect the iOS device to a Mac and run Xcode Server from Server.app and/or enable UI Automation testing. Then you can script and even code the things you need your \"electronic finger\" to test. There are many, many videos on the internet covering the test frameworks and how to set this up.\n\nA: A standard touch stylus is designed to work just a human finger on a captive screen.  Bonus is that your simulator doesn't start to smell after a couple days.\nYou have them with hard polymer tip but there's also cheaper ones with a softer, thin layered polymer layer over foam tip.  I don't know where you are from, but in Asian electronic malls they start at about 50 cents a pop.\n\n", "Q: Startup Disk Full: Core File The storage on my start up disk is being consumed by some kind of core files labeled as cores:1234 (numerical digits change). I downloaded OmniSweeper, which helped me locate these files and aware that each one is the size of >300mb. How do I disable this? \nIt is taking up space by the minute, literally. Screen shot provided below. \nThanks, \nDG\n\n\nA: They are coredumps, they are the result of a unix program crashing and then getting it's core dumped, which is basically a file containg what the program was doing when it crashed (memory state and CPU state).\nIf you have that many, it might be a symptom of a bigger underlying cause which you can check by inspecting the logs of you system using the Console app. To find out what binary (application program) the core belongs to, you can use the Terminal:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Terminal.app\n\n*Type \"file \" (excluding the quotes but keeping the space at the end) \n\n*Drop a core file on the terminal window, and it's full path will be entered\n\n*Press enter and the response will tell you all readable details on the file\n\n\nIn the end, however, unless you are a software developer, there is no point in keeping those core dump files, you can simply delete all of them.\n", "Q: Should I clean iMac fan ducts? Should I try to clean the fan ducts at the top and bottom of my five year old iMac? I have seen people say vacuuming or blowing air may mess up the innards.\n\nA: I replaced some memory in my friend's iMac of 3 year old recently and there was loads of dust on the modules. I blew the dust off the modules but didn't go in to major cleaning as it wasn't my machine. However with my own machine I would be reluctant blowing the dust off the inside of the iMac, but putting a vacuum cleaner at a very low speed shouldn't be harming much (provided the iMac is fully disconnected from the power socket.\nHope this helps.  All the best!\n\nA: The way to properly clean it is to take it apart.\nIf you're not confident to do that, take it to a professional. \nBlowing at it with a can of compressed air won't hurt - but it won't be anything like thorough either.\nVacuum cleaners are too risky, they build up static as part of their action & a discharge through any delicate component is likely to kill it.\n", "Q: The operation can’t be completed because the original item for “Новый том” can’t be found I have external hdd that I've connected to my wifi router Keenetic extra. I've enabled CIFS and FTP in router USB settings page.\nI can see this HDD folders in terminal using ls without a problem, but I have error trying to connect to it via finder.\nI've already tried solutions from this question, none of them works for me.\nIt seems very strange to me that two unix systems (os x and the linux on router) should use some windows-origin protocol SMB to share files with each other in the first place, actually, but alright.\nI've also read that os x use some proprietary smb implementation, and that could be the source of the problem, but I don't want to bother to install samba manually right now. How to diagnose this error or maybe there is some workarounds?\n\nA: I just had this issue from my Ubuntu file server and iMac running El Capitan. The way I solved it is to make sure the samba guest account in Linux has read access to the directory I'm sharing. I did this by adding guest account = foo under the [global] section of /etc/samba/smb.conf and making sure that user foo has read access to the directories I'm sharing. For reference, my share definitions (at the bottom of smb.conf) look like this:\n[share_name]\n  path = /media/path_to_directory\n  browseable = yes\n  read only = yes\n  guest ok = yes\n\n", "Q: dragging browser tabs to new window moves old window Happens periodically with chrome, not sure about other browsers.\nIf I have a window with multiple tabs and drag one of them either to create a new window or place it in another, usually to my other monitor, the original window gets moved as well, typically about half of the distance.\nThis just started happening out of now where, the only thing that has changed on my computer recently was I reinstalled chrome after having flash issues with video.\n\nA: Since this is not a OS X error, and is instead a browser error, you should submit it like this: https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95315?hl=en\nHope this helps! \n(Note that this bug is nonexistent on Safari, latest beta)\n", "Q: Can I add guide lines or background elements to my Pages document to assist with layout? I'm currently using Pages '09 on OS X 10.10.5. I have a document in portrait orientation that I occasionally print (8.5\" x 11\"), and fold into four equal vertical sections, like a spreadsheet with one column and four rows. Here's an image matching what I do with the printout.\n\nThe document consists of several text boxes. The text box layout is fitted to the content and this does not correspond to the page folding.

It has currently built-in 8GB [4GB x 2] RAM. My questions are:\n1] Can I upgrade RAM by simply adding 16GB [8GB x 2] in two empty ram slots? Or is it necessary to have 4GB x 2? Does it have to be 4GB... won't work with 8GB module? Is it that all modules have be with same capacity? Can I make it [4GB x 2 - built-in] + 8GB x 2 - to be added] 24 GB? \n2] Does memory module designed for i7 work in i5?\n\nA: *\n\n*Yes, you can mix and match memory modules with different capacities with no problems. My own late 2009 iMac is currently running with two of the 2GB modules it came with and two 8GB modules, for a total of 20GB. However, for the best performance you should \"pair\" the modules, and make sure you have two identical modules in adjacent slots.\n\n*There's no such thing as memory designed for an i7 or i5. What you need are 204-pin PC3-12800 (1600 MHz) DDR3 SO-DIMM modules, which can be used with either an i5 or i7 CPU.\n\nA: You can upgrade your iMac with 2 x 2 GB, 2x 4 GB or 2 x 8 GB PC3-12800 DDR3 1600 MHz modules. If you buy a pair of identical modules and install them in one bank you will benefit from memory interleaving. The first bank are slot 1 and 3 which already are occupied by the Apple OEM modules. The second bank are slot 2 and 4.\nMemory modules aren't designed for the marketing name of a processor but for a system architecture. The six generations of ix-processors (i3, i5, i7) support at least seven different types of modules (but every generation only a subset of the listed):\n\n\n*\n\n*DDR3-800\n\n*DDR3-1066\n\n*DDR3-1333\n\n*DDR3-1600\n\n*DDR3-1866 \n\n*DDR4-1866\n\n*DDR4-2133\n\n\nSome ix-processors even support ECC-modules.\nIn Mac models the memory modules are usually interchangeable between the i5 and the i7 variety of a particular machine (e.g. iMac14,2 i5 and iMac14,2 i7).\n", "Q: Is the 2011 Macbook Pro body equivalent to the 2012 model? My mid-2012 Macbook Pro's body is damaged beyond repair but the internal parts are still functional. Is it possible that I could assemble the parts into a 2011 body of the same size and have a functional laptop?\n\nA: Probably not. You could attempt it, since they're both about the same size, but I don't think that it would work due to the small differences that will likely exist between the two models.

I just updated to iOS 9.0.2 direct from iOS 8.4 and this morning (a Sunday) I noticed the alarm icon in my status bar.\nI have two repeating weekday alarms, and I thought the previous behaviour was to show the icon if you had a pending alarm on the same day, but now it seems to be present if there are any upcoming alarms active, even if they're days away.\nSimilarly I thought that if I dismissed a repeating alarm and there were no other alarms active that day, the icon would disappear for the rest of that day. This doesn't happen now.\nI see a possibly related unanswered post on Apple Support Communities: Why is the alarm icon showing with no alarm set?\nThe iPhone User Guide for iOS 8.4 on page 15 says the icon means \"an alarm is set\", which could mean either really.\nIs this new behaviour, or am I misremembering?\n\nA: This is not new behaviour.

I'm thinking to buy IPhone 6s [mabybe Plus] from Apple's website. They are offering SIM-FREE version of those. What I want to ask is ... does SIM-FREE mean UNLOCKED and ready to use iphone anywhere in world?\n\nA: The correct term is FU - Factory Unlocked, but SIM-FREE or UNLOCKED are widely used.  This means that you the phone is not locked to a certain service provider.\nAlthough there are different type of networks around the world, your iPhone 6s will work with most of them, both with voice and data, as long as you insert a local simcard.  Exception might be China  or if a specific carrier cannot support iPhones at all or refuses to support people who don't buy iPhones from them. \nIf you want to get the fastest available LTE network speeds, things get a little bit more complicated.  The list on http://www.apple.com/iphone/LTE/ will show you which phone you should get to access these fast speeds.  As you can see this list is far from complete - there's a lot of countries not on it.  This doesn't mean your iPhone won't work over there.\nYour iPhone 6s will still work and switch back to another - lower broadband wireless - access speed.  Still very much usable though.\n\nA: The iPhone comes unlocked and without a SIM card.

So I wanted to hide the Finder icon on my Dock. \nAccording to this answer - How can I remove the Finder icon from my Dock? I am suppose to edit DockMenus.plist file. When I tried I had no permission to do that. I tried to use chmod (also with sudo) on that file with no effect, same message from terminal - Unable to change file mode on DockMenus.plist: Operation not permitted. I ran ls -lOe on that file and I learned that apparently there is new permission flag called restricted.\nI still don't know how to get permission to edit that file. Does anyone have any solution?\n\nA: I have solved this issue only by booting to Recovery Mode (press CMDR during restart) and launching Terminal.

I am using El Capitan on a 15\" MacBook Pro mid 2015. I downloaded a Windows 10 iso file from the Microsoft website. \nThen I used Boot Camp Assistant and selected the file. I allocated 120 GB to the Windows partition. It did it's thing and then restarted automatically. It booted back to OSX.\nWhen I look at About This Mac, I see the Bootcamp partition.\nIf I hold the option button while the Macbook reboots, it only shows me my Mac OS partition.\nDid something go wrong? It's like Windows 10 didn't install.. what should I do from here?\n\nA: Boot Camp Assistant is a glorified partitioner. It doesn't do any actual installation of anything. For that, you'll have to actually launch the Windows installer from the ISO, by burning it to a disk first, and booting off of that.\n", "Q: Cannot synch iMessages from old iPhone to new activated iPhone It seems that my text/iMessages from old iPhone is not synching with my new iPhone.  Is there anything special that needs to be done for the messages to synch?  Everything else is synched.\n\nA: iMessage history only syncs a limited window.

Then I find that if I delete from Macbook, they delete from iCloud. \nHow can I delete locally nad have iCloud store all the photos?\n\nA: Think of the iCloud library as one library that exist in the cloud. Setting aside the moment between when you turn it on and when all of the photos are uploaded for just a moment, each of your devices will have some mail of every image in the library as well as a larger version of the file. \nOn a device per device basis you can request the original sized file or let the system shrink, compress, optimize when storage runs low. \nThis design works well for people that just want to have one library and not several versions of the library.  The point of iCloud photo library is if you have a 50 GB library total, you'll still end up with the same number of photos on each device even if the entire library size is 10 GB on an iPhone 30 GB on an iPad and 20 GB on your Mac.\nThe compression only kicks in once your space gets low  on a specific device. I believe there are several settings of compression so that as you begin to fill up your storage with things other than the photo library, the images can continue to shrink up to the point where you have nothing left but thumbnails, presumably.\n\nA: Back up your photos and videos\nWhen you turn on iCloud Photos, your photos and videos automatically upload to iCloud. They're not duplicated in your iCloud backup, so you should keep backup copies of your library. You can download your photos and videos from iCloud.com to your computer and store them as a separate library, transfer them to another computer with Image Capture or Photos, or store them on a separate drive.\nIf you're on a device with iOS 11 or later or macOS High Sierra or later, the photos and videos you take are in HEIF and HEVC format. These formats use less storage, with the same quality.\nicloud photos \n", "Q: copy the link of the current played video/stream in iOS Is it possible to copy the link of the current played video/stream in iOS in the Safari or another 3rd party Browser? Have a look at the screenshot below in the bottom left corner.\nIn OS X I'm able to do it with a right click on the video/stream and then Copy Video Address.\n\nDoes someone have an idea?\n\nA: I wasn't able to copy the URL, however if you want to view the entire thing to transcribe it, start playing your video and then lock your iOS device.  The full URL should scroll by on your lock screen.\n\nA: Sadly, there is no such feature in Apples APIs at the moment. I solved it writing a short script which searches the HTML code for video URLs.\nUPDATE:\nBut there's the possibility to view the url. Look at Josh Newman's answer. https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/268156/153006\n\nA: Only known way to me — you can find it and copy it from the website html source.\nThe source AFAIK cannot be shown in safari, so you can Google “view page source online” and paste your website url to the web app. Search for <video tag in the source.\nI found my mp4 video url that way.\n", "Q: Is there an easy way to install Linux similar to Boot Camp? I've so far been using Disk Utility to partition my Mac's drive and install Linux, but is there an easier way to do it, using something similar to Boot Camp, or a third-party software application that will split your drives easily (and is not malware)?\n\nA: Apple's disk utility is all you need to partition your disk.  \nIt's what Boot Camp calls underneath the hood.  Most Linux distributions have adequate information to make a DIY installer, but if you want something as polished as Boot Camp I would recommend Boot Runner by Two Canoes.  It comes with support so you don't really have to learn anything other than how to install Linux as it manages the dual-boot environment very well. \n\n\n*\n\n*http://twocanoes.com/products/mac/boot-runner\n", "Q: Opening of encrypted sparse bundle in El Capitan very slow I have a 76GB encrypted sparse bundle on the rMBP SSD drive. Mounting it by double clicking it in Finder was pretty much immediate in Yosemite. \nWith El Capitan a popup appears with \"Verifying 'name of sparse bundle'\" and a progress bar. The progress bar shows no progress and after fifteen minutes or so the popup disappears and the password entry dialog box appears. After the password has been entered the sparse bundle is finally mounted.\nWhen I run the Disk Utility First Aid function on the mounted volume it finishes in a few seconds and reports no errors. Console does not seem to show any related messages during the mounting.\nIs there any reason why this popup appears and is there a way to circumvent it? Fifteen minutes to mount a volume is just not practical.\n\nA: I also had a sparse bundle that was very slow (>1 minute) to mount, but I solved this (it now mounts in seconds) by turning off automatic file system checking. Before I figured it out, this would happen:\nhdiutil attach -verbose ~/the.sparsebundle paused at this line:\nChecking volumes…\nand it would appear in Activity Monitor as hdiutil using 100% CPU, for over a minute at a time, depending on connection speed.\nTo speed things up, pass the noautofsck option to hdiutil, like so:\nhdiutil -noautofsck ~/the.sparsebundle\nOr if you are mounting any other way, set the system preference:\ndefaults write com.apple.frameworks.diskimages auto-fsck -bool NO\nIt is possible your update to Sierra resulted in a default being reset and/or a bugfix, per the hdiutil man page:\n\nBy default, only quarantined images (e.g. downloaded from the\n  Internet) that have not previously passed fsck are checked.\n\nYou could turn off the automatic file system checking and then check the output of diskutil verifyVolume /Volumes/theSparseBundleVolume occasionally, as a balance between data integrity and convenience. Keep in mind, that diskutil command will unmount your volume.\n\nA: After installing Sierra the password popup appears instantaneously. After entering the password the volume is available immediately. So for anyone else with this problem I'd say upgrade to Sierra.\n", "Q: Does Apple still produce installer discs for OS X? Does Apple still produce installer discs for OS X? I know that they have made discs for OS X in the past, but I have not been able to find any online. Does Apple still create these discs?\n\nA: No, Apple has discontinued physical install discs since 2011. The last version of OS X that was able to be purchased on a disc was OS X Snow Leopard (10.6). Now, you will need to buy a installable USB for the operating system you want, if it is 10.7 or above.

I don't know what kind or to what extent, so I don't want to boot into the system. My question is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is there a good boot time anti-malware like Avira Rescue Kit (which won't seem to boot on a Mac)?\n\n*Or, should I boot into the recovery partition, and run Malwarebytes?\n\n\nThanks\n\nA: Malwarebytes is at best terribly ineffective from my experience. Why do you suspect a rootkit? I don't think you're wrong, possibly very perceptive but just wondering why. \nThe problem with rootkits is they will hide all evidence of their existence especially from a rickety Malwarebytes scan. Mac malware creators must be sophisticated enough to jump some of the small hurdles Apple attempts to create so keep that in mind in terms of the persistence factor at play. \nWhat makes you think that the malware won't go hide in your NVRAM, xartstorage (secure enclave, graphics card, SMC, create a RAMDisk, etc. to make you think that it's gone and that Recovery Mode really is an almighty kill switch and isn't just a pacifier that effectively negates all legitimate and acceptable levels suspicion.\nmacOS (previously styled OS X) is inherently insecure. \"It just works\" is not the befitting of a truly secure operating system. In which case \"I expletive hate it,\" would probably be more likely. Focus groups probably would have found that didn't go have quite the same cachet. \nTo assess the potential of this type of malware: \n\n\n*\n\n*Open terminal and type cat /dev/ and paste the results if you wish. \n\n*When you reinstall the OS in Recovery, look for an process called \"unknown\" the the install logs (Command L and then be sure to select the option in the top left corner to show all progress and errors). \n\n*You could also enable kernel debugging and read the kextlog shown as your OS boots. In full disclosure this does require a high level of modest effort so it's perfectly acceptable and possibly most productive to dismiss the possibility of a root-kit in advance.\n\n*Obtain a copy of the entire disk with all volumes and mount it read only to a Windows VM then try various malware scans.\n\n", "Q: MPlayerX on OS X suddenly doesn't interpolate video anymore? (fullscreen = ugly pixelated output) I always favor MPlayerX as my video player, it works perfectly. However since a few days, when playing fullscreen, it seems to no longer interpolate the video content, resulting in a 'pixelated' output.\nIf I compare it with QuickTime or VLC for example, using the same video file, with MPlayerX I can see pixel blocks in the output, the typical jagged edges from image stretching, whereas it looks smooth in other players.\nI already removed + reinstalled it, no difference. I checked all the settings, couldn't find anything related, I changed 'image enhancement' between None, Normal, and Advanced, no difference.\nIn case it's relevant: I upgraded to El Capitan earlier this week. Can't tell for sure but this problem started somewhere around the same time. Can it be related, and if yes, is there any El Capitan-specific setting involved that could fix this?\n\nA: I had the same problem at my both devices, MacBook Air (mid 2011) and 5k Retina iMac (mid 2014) only after upgrading to El Capitan. I tried everything to solve the issue with MPlayerX (as it's my fav player and most used app) but no luck. Later i downgraded my MacBook Air to Yosemite and problem was solved.\nNow I don't think it's a OS X related problem because other players are running smoothly so I guess it's high time for MPlayerX to release a new version.   \n\nA: I've had the same issue since the first El Capitan betas.

I made sure the resulting certificate was in my Keychain, and trusted it explicitly. In attempts to send encrypted mail to that account the encryption icon is never activated and the certificate does not show up on the TLS certificate list for the account (Mail Preferences). I've also tried creating a Certificate Authority and using that to generate a leaf S/MIME certificate, with the same results. I found detailed instructions for setting up server and client certificates at\ndeveloper.apple.com/library/ios/technotes/tn2326/_index.html\nbut, following those instructions, trying to adapt for S/MIME, produced the same result.\nSigning mail from that account works fine.\nIs there any way to do this?\n\nA: First, to get the certificate to show up in the TLS section of the account, you need to import the cert into your keychain in P12 format. This is important because if you only import the cert (.crt), then that is only the public-facing portion of the identity (i.e. the public key). When you import the cert as a .p12, you are importing both the .crt and the private key associated with it. Now, keychain recognizes this as YOUR identity and will let you select it in mail as the source of encryption and signing. Also be sure that the certificate you are using has the correct authority to encrypt and sign email. You can verify this by checking for the presence of \"email protection\" under extended key usage and \"Digital signature\" and \"key encipherment\" under Key usage. Without these, you will likely have similar problems.\nSimilarly, be sure the .crt of the person you are encrypting is in your keychain, or you won't be able to encrypt TO them.\n", "Q: Calendar.app extremely slow in El Capitan. Rebuild cache? Other solution? After updating to El Capitan, my friend found her Calendar.app runs extremely slowly. Clicking the button to move to the next week's display results in spinning beach ball (the new one). Beach ball spins for something like half a minute. Makes the app practically unusable for someone booking appointments while the customer waits.\nThe same calendars shared over iCloud run nearly instantaneously on an iPad Calendar app (iOS 9.0.2). So the problem seems to be Mac-only. \nAll other apps run well. Only Calendar is beach-ball-spinning slow.\nCalendar.app was already annoyingly slow in Mountain Lion & Yosemite, but is much worse in El Capitan. This computer has been upgraded through the years across these OSes.\nPerhaps crud has accumulated in the Mac's local files for these calendars. Is there some way to rebuild or replace the Mac's cache of these calendars and get fresh copies from iCloud?\nAny other workarounds or solutions?\n\nA: I guess I had the same problem and just found a solution - at least in my case it helped a lot. Not as fast as it was in the past but much faster than it was after updating to El Capitan. And no more spinning balls ;)\nClose Calendar.app, go to ~/Library/Preferences/ in your home folder and delete com.apple.iCal.plist.\nGood luck!\n\nA: I solved my slow calendar by turning off Birthday calendars, Holiday Calendar, and Siri Found in Apps Calendar in the Calendar preferences.\nI noticed an immediate improvement in speed. I restarted Calendar and the speed improved even more.\nI suspect the slowness came from the birthday calendar feature. I have 5,787 contacts and that causes slowness elsewhere. I noticed Calendar app RAM usage went from about 300MB to about 100MB after turning off the special calendars.\nStefan's answer to Close Calendar.app, go to ~/Library/Preferences/ in your home folder and delete com.apple.iCal.plist helped initially, but things got slow again and another delete of the plist didn't help.\n\n\nA: A Genius appointment at an Apple Store did the trick. \nUnfortunately the man helping us is not sure what he did precisely that worked. He is sure it was some kind of preference, cache, etc file that he deleted. But he tried so many things that we are not sure exactly what did it.\nHe also perished the logs on the Console.app but never got a clue as to what caused the glacial slowness.\nBut work it did. Day-and-night comparison. Calendar works zippy fast now. \nSorry that I don't have a specific solution. I'm posting this Answer only to communicate that anyone else suffering this problem should have some hope that they can fix this problem on their Mac. It is a client-side problem, not a server-side Apple-controlled problem. \nBe very sure to have a good backup (or two) before experimenting.\n\nA: This is not an answer, but perhaps a hint in the right direction. I have 2 calendars syncd with my iCalendar app: One is iCloud and it's fast, the other is an exchange calendar and it has the beach ball issue.\nMaybe it's an exchange issue?\n", "Q: Can I unplug my Mac mini from power once it's in hibernate mode? Suppose I want to work on my Mac mini here, reach a certain point in my work, then put it in hibernate mode and unplug the power.\nFrom what I understand the hibernate mode will save the status of the Mac into the disk, and will unpower all devices. So, from what I understand, I can now unplug the Mac mini and no damage will occur. \nIn principle I can take my Mac mini into my messenger bag, drive 2 hours to home, and once at home attach it to a power plug with its cord and power it back on. At that stage the Mac will take some time to restore from disk, but I will have got the same status of my Mac as when I switched it off.\nPlease note this is not the same as \"reopen current windows\", because certain programs have a more complex status than just having an open window and its position. For one example (and there are several) you can think to Terminal.app. If you have multiple tabs open each history of commands is preserved separately until you quit the Terminal.app, once you quit only one tab history is saved to file and persist to your next reboot (btw, I am aware there \"fixes\" to this behaviour, but they do not apply to my actual case, I just need to carry an example). \nDo you see any flaws in my story? Is it really possible to unplug the Mac mini once it has gone into hibernate mode?\n\nA: You shouldn't unplug your Mac unless it's shut off; however you can do it using hibernate mode. The closest to hibernate is in this answer, How can I manually put a Macbook Pro to hibernate without going to sleep mode first?, it outlines how to enable hibernate on your Mac, which it actually copies the memory to the disk, and if you loose power, it restores the memory. It's made for MacBooks, but will work fine for any Mac.\nThe Reopen Windows feature should work, but I don't like using at, as it can significantly slow down startup (and login) speed.\n\nA: I have tested using the settings from Peter Rigby's answer here and they work fine: \nhttps://superuser.com/questions/139354/how-can-i-manually-put-a-macbook-pro-to-hibernate-without-going-to-sleep-mode-fi/630985#630985\nIn a console switching the hibernation mode to 25 will make make a Mac Mini hibernate instead of sleep:\nsudo pmset -a hibernatemode 25\n\nTo revert it back to the default  (which powers the ram and writes image to disk)\nsudo pmset -a hibernatemode 3\n\nTo list your current settings\npmset -g\n\nIf you want to sleep/hibernate your machine from the command line do\npmset sleepnow\n\nOr select sleep from Menu - your mac will hibernate to disk - I have a Macmini8,1 with the 6-Core Intel Core i5 and 64 GB of Memory, it takes about 30-120 seconds until the light turns off and I can unplug and start again elsewhere.\n", "Q: How to crop a photo in inches on iPad? You can crop photos in the Photo app, like \"square\", \"3:2\" etc. but are those in inches? Or just ratio? How do I crop a photo in x-inch by y-inch on iPad?\n\nA: The options presented in the crop dialog in the Photos app are ratios, and can be scaled to any size.\nSince digital photographs are simply made of pixels, it is impossible to assign physical measurements to the somewhat abstract representation of an image. The physical size would depend entirely on what scale it is displayed or printed at. An image can have a pixel density of any number of pixels per square inch. For instance, even if you restrict the parameters to iPads with Retina displays, one square inch can hold 264 or 326 pixels.\nIf you're cropping an image so it will fit on a certain type of photo paper, you can use the ratio of width to height to determine what ratio to crop your image with.\n", "Q: Inspect the content of Time Machine single backup Every time I make a backup with Time Machine, the size of the data backed up is always 2Gb+.\nI don't understand where all these data are coming from.\nIs there a way to inspect the content of the single backup?\n\nA: TimeTracker - this allows you to see the individual files backed up to Time Machine.\n(It's a little down on the website.)\n\nA: I guess this question is pretty old now, but just in case anyone is still looking for something, I use BackupLoupe.\n\nA: You can use the preinstalled tmutil utility on the command line (Terminal.app) to show the difference between two snapshots.\nsudo bash\n\n# Go to the time machine folder on your backup disk\ncd /Volumes/BackupDisk/Backups.backupdb/mymac/\n\n# List all available backups\nls -l\n\n# Compare two backups\ntmutil compare 2019-01-15-203957 2019-01-15-211038\n\nManpage entry for tmutil compare:\n\nIf no arguments are provided, tmutil will compare the computer to the latest snapshot.

(Then it could be used as an indicator for something else.)\n\nA: A couple years ago there was rumours about malware being able to run the camera without having the light on.  Both LED and Camera are driven by the Apple SMC (System Management Controller) and are linked together far below OSX user level.\nSince then Apple most probably have put extra efforts to avoid usage of one without the other.\n", "Q: my passport for Mac on a PC I have photos on My Pass0port for Mac and attempted without success to download other photos using my Acer which uses Windows 10\n\nA: By default the Mac formats external drives with HFS+ format.

I used a crummy AT&T (*coughAT&Tsymbollookslikedeathstarcough*) router to build a private LAN.  It has no service/DSL connections, there for it detects no internet access (naturally) and will give me this pop-up on a Mac:\n\nThis, as you can see, seems to be a Safari window of sorts that is sourcing captive.apple.com.  Because I have no DSL connection, all DNS resolutions get translated to the router's web host.  This means that every 5 to 10 minutes I get this pop-up.  The WiFi connection does work, but I get this annoying pop-up that interrupts my work.\nOn an iPhone, I have a similarish problem, although it is more consequential.  In Settings --> Wireless it gives me this same page asking me to Log In.  I assume that's the function of captive.apple.com.  I know places like McDonalds or Starbucks will do this to make sure you come in and buy something before getting on their WiFi.\nMy Question is this:  How do I disable this on a Mac so that I don't have to worry with this pop-up anymore?

I use this excellent airplay speaker and iOS device for streaming music from Spotify. Unfortunately, the connection to Airplay reverts (timeout?) to the iPhone 6 Plus speaker after a short time. I would like it to connect by default to the Z2 and stay connected. Any ideas?\n\nA: I haven't been able to accomplish this without additional equipment. It seems that the networking in the Z2 is faulty. I instead connect an AirPort Express aux port to the Z2 aux port and airplay to the AirPort (after enabling airplay in the airport settings). The AirPort streams perfectly without dropping the connection and the Z2 still sounds great over aux.

I thought I had set up Mail.app, but found only two accounts were listed: iCloud and Comcast. When I attempt to add an account (any of the remaining three), I am asked for username and password, then informed that the account is already active. Mail.app has not crashed, just won't accept any other accounts. I have all five running on an iMac (Yosemite) and an iPad.\nNo apparent way of manually setting up the accounts; I'm thinking of visiting the Genius bar!\n\nA: O.K. I have an update. I had checked the \"hand-off\" to another Mac in the General preferences. I unchecked it and now have two of the accounts added. Then, finally, I unchecked all the Google items in the Internet Accounts pane, turned off any device with Google anything, logged into Google from the Internet Accounts pane and mirabile dictu! gmail is now in place and downloading messages.\nSo: 1. Handoff is a nice feature, but it sure can mess up Mail.\n    2. Gmail is as quirky as many have claimed.\nThanks to bike for his answer.\n\nA: Apple is shifting software questions to online support since you don't need an appointment there. http://support.apple.com\nHowever, you might make a head start on the troubleshooting by making a second user account.

In Outlook I've seen various ways to move to a folder via a keyboard shortcut and then select the folder to move to (a two step process); I could not find a way to move an email to a particular folder with a single keyboard shortcut.\nIs there a way a to move an email to a designated folder with a single keyboard shortcut in Outlook 2016 for Mac?\nNote: I had previously asked this question at personal productivity but my question was deemed \"too specific\".\n\nA: This isn't exactly the question you asked, but Ctrl-e is the keyboard shortcut for archiving a message (at least as of Outlook for Mac version 15.36).\n\nA: Can be done via Keyboard Shortcuts under System Preferences\nManually move the email once to the folder that you want, say Archives by right-clicking the email and choose it or using Shift Cmd M. After that Archives will start showing as one of the options when you try to another move email. \n\nOnce you’ve moved the message the folder becomes a recent item under the Move menu button in Outlook and a keyboard shortcut can now be assigned to it. \nOpen Keyboard Shortcuts under System Preferences and assign your favourite keyboard shortcut e.g. Control-Option-A to move messages to this folder (Archives).\n\n\nA: This works for me in v15.30.   Trick is replace \"Archives\" with the exact folder name.  \"Archives\" is not a command name but the name of the folder you want the shortcut to move the mail to.  \n\nA: In the latest version, you can  Archive with the following shortcut: Ctrl+E.\n\n", "Q: Choose which Airport to connect to I have an Airport Extreme on one floor and another one on the second floor as an extender.

I am using Photos app on my mac, without the knickknacks like Photo Stream, iCloud etc. The exact location of photos is the default one: /users/xxx/Pictures/Photos Library/Masters. \nI have deleted some photos directly from the Masters folder in Finder, then also from the trash. Yet I still see these photos in Photos app. When I go to Finder again the photos are not there anymore. How come are these photos still displayed in Photos? Are they cached somewhere? Even a restart still shows me those.\n\nA: I was facing the same problem.  Not only were the pictures still being displayed within the Photos app, the pictures (and their folders) that I have deleted manually in the Masters folder, have reappeared in that folder again after when I clicked on a few images within the Photos app.  The best way apparently to permanently delete the pictures would be to do so within the Photos app (see http://www.imore.com/how-delete-images-and-videos-photos-os-x#delete-permanent).\n", "Q: Is finder search supposed to work as \"full text search\" at all in OS X El Capitan?

When I Type DSC_2345 I see the photo.\nSo my question is:\nIs this full text search just supported with a maximum of 3 digits? It seems strange to me... I had a similar strange Finder search problem somehow also in Yosemite.\n\nA: Finder uses Spotlight to index and search for files and folders.  There are several resources that can help you with understanding the way Spotlight indexes files on your Mac.\nSince you are looking for an exact phrase type of text search, use quotation marks.  (See below)\nIn Finder select the Help menu and type in Spotlight for further information.\n\nApple support: If searching your Mac doesn’t return expected results\nFrom Apple's Support site regarding unexpected search results:\n\nOS X El Capitan: If searching your Mac doesn’t return expected results\n  There are several things you can try if a search doesn’t return the\n  items you expect.\nCheck the text you entered in the search field\n  Make sure the word or\n  phrase is spelled correctly.\nTo search for an exact phrase, enclose it in quotation marks.\n  For example, enter “trip to Paris” to find items that contain that exact\n  phrase.

Also, googling only brought up guides for Word 2011, which don't work with Office 2016.\nCould some one of you please point me to the correct option?\nThanks a lot!\n\nA: This is not auto-save however.  This simply sets the interval at which Excel will generate an auto-save file should there be a crash.  If you close without saving, this file is immediately deleted.  If the crash doesn't meet Microsoft's definition of a crash, the file is deleted.  If you don't open Excel properly the next time, the auto-recover won't show and the file will be deleted.  \nWhat most people want, myself included, is a true autosave.  Once you create a file, name it and save it once, it will continue to save it again at a set interval.

A lot of images already contain a soft link to the Applications folder to be more convenient for the user. \n\nIf the .dmg contains such a soft link just drop the app on it (like indicated by the grey arrow in the screenshot above).\nYou have to enter an admin password to start the task if you aren't logged in with a user with admin permissions. You always have to enter an admin password if you copy the file into /Applications/Utilities/.\nAll subsequent installations (like LaunchDaemons or application support files) are done by the app itself after starting it for the first time.\nAfter copying the app to one of the folders mentioned above, you can unmount the \"installer\" volume and delete the .dmg file.\n\nA: DMG are disk images which, when used to transport/install applications, can contain one of the following\n\n\n*\n\n*the application (.app) itself: to install, just copy the application into the /Applications folder (admin password required)\n\n*an installer application (usually identified by its name): to install the application, you can run the installer directly from the DMG\n\n*a package installer (ending in .pkg): to install, execute the package installer directly from the DMG\n\n\nIn all three cases you don't need the DMG any longer after installation (but may want to keep it for backup purposes). \n", "Q: Position of the configuration files of TexMaker Someone could provide information about the position inside the pc of the configuration files for the application TeXMaker. I can't find any file in the home directory. \nMore precisely, I'm looking for the .ini file in order to make permanent changes in the path.\n\nA: The texmaker.ini file is created in the user's home and it's stored in:\n~/.config/xm1\n\nIf I do\nls ~/.config/xm1/\n\nthe result is\ntexmaker.ini        texmakerapp.ini\n\n\nA: A easy way to access your .ini file in texmaker options>manage settings file>save a copy\nThis creates a .ini file and allows you to save it anywhere you like. You can then manipulate this file use this page page as reference copying and pasting which is what I did. Make sure you only use texmaker code if config texmaker and texstudio if texstudio.\nFrom there options>manage settings file>replace settings file by new one (one that you manipulated)\nHope this helps!\n", "Q: Why cannot discover user in Airdrop when open personal hotspot? When my iPhone opens the personal hotspot, I cannot find other users via Airdrop. What is the theory behind it?\n\nA: AirDrop is different than a personal hotspot.  \nA personal hotspot is for sharing your internet connection.\nAirDrop has separate controls, located in the control center.   You must also turn on Bluetooth and wifi.\nOfficial Apple doc with screenshots.\n", "Q: What is the radio frequency of Airdrop transmission? I know the Airdrop uses WiFi direct to send the packet, but what is the radio frequency of it so I can capture the traffic. \nIs the WiFi 2.4Ghz, 5Ghz or both?\n\nA: The protocol is called AWDL, trying googling that.  Here's a starter\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/19587701/what-is-awdl-apple-wireless-direct-link-and-how-does-it-work\n\nA: AirDrop uses Bluetooth and WiFi to broadcast beacons and identify and negotiate a peer to peer mesh link. Since the WiFi radios are capable of multiple transmissions, they will hop and change channels based on the conditions at the time of the construction of the peer to peer mesh. \nSince there are far more 5 GHz channels available than 2.4 GHz (and they are faster and they suffer less from overlap and suffer less in interference) I would presume the chances are highly stacked to prefer a free 5 GHz channel, but it’s not guaranteed this happens when you measure the actual traffic. \nYou will need sophisticated hardware to capture this traffic by listening and as it’s encrypted, even once you capture it, the contents are likely going to be difficult to decrypt. \n", "Q: how can I avoid custom access permissions when copying from time machine I have recently done a clean install of El Capitan, having backed up files on Time Machine.  However, there is something wrong with the time machine backup: when I enter time machine it won't list the old backup, only the one that I did after the clean install.  (I think there's a problem with the drive I'm using.)  However, the files are all there, so I can copy them to my hard drive using the cp command in the terminal.\nHowever, if I try\n\ncp -r /Volumes/TimeMachine/.../Documents/* Documents\n\nall the files appear with today's time stamp, which is not very helpful.\nIf on the other hand I enter\n\ncp -pr /Volumes/TimeMachine/.../Documents/* Documents\n\nI get the correct time stamps, but I also get the level of protection that Time Machine has - which is to say I can't edit anything I copied! \nDoes anyone know whether there's a way to preserve time stamps, but not this extreme level of protection? \nThanks\n\nA: A way to copy files which can deal with interruptions etc, that is it will not copy something that has not changed is to use rsync\nOS X comes with an old version and it is best to get a newer one from macports, homebrew etc. This can copy ACLs and there is a bug in the OS X one (that is in one of my other answers her or SU or SO) \nThe simple copy is (the directory Documents to the current directory)\nrsync -rtlA /Volumes/TimeMachine/.../Documents .\n\n-a does several other parameters (-rlptgoD ) -A copies the ACLs\n-r recurses into directories, -t preservers modification times, -l copies symlinks as simlinks\n\nA: If you restore files using the Time Machine interface, it preserves permissions and dates properly. Also, using finder might be preferable to cp in this case as well.\nWhen I have problems locating files from the GUI, here's what I do.\n\n\n*\n\n*Remove all my Time Machine destinations - this doesn't delete any backups, but it lets the Time Machine menu icon to show the \"Browse\" other backups so that I can be 100% sure I'm checking the correct backup destination.\n\n*Use the go to folder Finder shortcut in Time Machine - Shift + Control + G - then paste the folder where you want to \"browse\" in the backup.\n\n", "Q: Handoff and Instant Hotspot with El Capitan on MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Early 2013)? after upgrade to El Capitan, I don't get Instant Hotspot and Handoff to work (I am particularly interested in the possibility to make phone calls using my iPhone 5 from my Mac). It was working on Yosemite.\nNow I saw on Apple Support that info about the compatibility:\n\nHandoff and Instant Hotspot\nHandoff and Instant Hotspot are supported by the following Mac models,\n  and require OS X Yosemite:\nMacBook Air (Mid 2012 and later)\nMacBook Pro (Mid 2012 and later)\nMacBook (Retina, 12-inch, Early 2015)\niMac (Late 2012 and later)\nMac mini (Late 2012 and later)\nMac Pro (Late 2013)\n\n\nNow I have a MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Early 2013) and it does not seem to be mentioned here.\nMy Question: can I use Handoff and Instant Hotspot with my MacBook Pro Retina?\nBecauese I can't seem to be able to set it up (enabled in System Preferences -> General -> Allow Handoff is enabled) in FaceTime.\n\nA: *\n\n*Turn off Bluetooth on your Mac\n\n*Delete /Library/Preferences/com.apple.Bluetooth.plist\n\n*Turn Bluetooth back on\n\n", "Q: Move focus to another display with keyboard I'm using Yosemite. I have two external displays with several spaces (I like the idea one app per space).\nSometimes I want to move focus to another display without using a mouse. I have few solutions but they are not ideal.\n\n\n*\n\n*cmd+F4 Move focus to next or another window in System Preferences - it moves focus but mouse still stays on previous display so moving spaces does not work properly (ctrl+←or→ moves spaces on previous display)\n\n*BetterTouchTool can move mouse, but mouse position should be hardcoded. What is more moving a mouse does not cause moving the focus, you should click additionally and it's not always good\n\n*ctrl+n can move to n space, but it does not work if space is opened on another screen e.g. if space 1 is focused on display 1 and space 2 is opened on display 2 then pressing ctrl+2 does not move focus, but pressing ctrl+3 and then ctrl+2 does (if space 3 is created on display 2)\nDo you have any ideas?\n\nA: Summary:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install  hammerspoon \n\n*Copy the following code into init.lua and run hammerspoon  \n\n*Press Cmd+1 to toggle between screens \n\n\nFor people who are looking for another solution to this, consider using hammerspoon (which is a great application that lets you write scripts for automating osx using lua). I've included the following code in my init.lua file to implement screen switching upon pressing Cmd+1.\nlocal function focus_other_screen() -- focuses the other screen \n   local screen = hs.mouse.getCurrentScreen()\n   local nextScreen = screen:next()\n   local rect = nextScreen:fullFrame()\n   local center = hs.geometry.rectMidPoint(rect)\n   hs.mouse.setAbsolutePosition(center)\nend \n\nfunction get_window_under_mouse() -- from https://gist.github.com/kizzx2/e542fa74b80b7563045a \n   local my_pos = hs.geometry.new(hs.mouse.getAbsolutePosition())\n   local my_screen = hs.mouse.getCurrentScreen()\n   return hs.fnutils.find(hs.window.orderedWindows(), function(w)\n                 return my_screen == w:screen() and my_pos:inside(w:frame())\n   end)\nend\n\nfunction activate_other_screen()\n   focus_other_screen() \n   local win = get_window_under_mouse() \n   -- now activate that window \n   win:focus() \nend \n\nhs.hotkey.bind({\"cmd\"}, \"1\", function() -- does the keybinding\n      activate_other_screen()\nend)\n\nThis works by moving the mouse to the other screen, then focusing the application which is directly under the mouse. The code is in lua. Please see hammerspoon for more details. \n\nA: Nevermind, I found an app which does it - Amethyst. I've been looking for something like that for ages\n", "Q: Updated XCode to 7.0.1 via the app store but it still shows itself at 6.4 in the app and missing the new features I tried to update Xcode to 7.0.1 today and it told me that I needed to get OS X 10.10.4 or greater (I had 10.10.3). I agreed to that update, but it didn't update OS X and has now marked XCode as being at 7.0.1 in the App Store. However if I go into XCode it still shows 6.4 and lacks the new features like iOS 9 in the simulator.\nSo I had it do the OS update to 10.10.5 and let it do the reboot and install process. It came back up and it still shows that XCode is at 6.4 in the application itself, but as updated in the App Store.\nWhat gives? Any idea how to get it to actually update?\n\nA: I would do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Xcode\n\n*Open Preferences\n\n*select Locations\n\n\nIf your command line tools and Xcode about box don't both say 7.0.1 (7A1001) then you might want to just delete Xcode using Launchpad and then re-open the App Store to download a clean copy of the app. If you want to purge old simulators and SDK from ~/Library/Developer, do that now as well after making a backup of things just in case. \n\nI had some issues with the beta versions of the app and deleting all traces of the app helped me with some document set download issues - perhaps your simulator issues are related to mixing versions between 6 and 7 too?\n\nA: See my answer to a somewhat-similar question here.  I have a feeling that it will solve your specific issue as well.\n", "Q: BootChamp no longer works on El Capitan, what's the fastest way to boot into Windows? Ever since OS X El Capitan, BootChamp, the utility that let you directly restart into Windows from the menu bar (without needing to hold the option key) no longer works. The developer's explanation can be found here.\nHow can I quickly boot into Windows, ideally from the menu bar?\nPerhaps a way to package an AppleScript into a menu bar icon? I don't want to disable SIP just for BootChamp. \n\nA: You could maybe try to disable System Integrity Protection that came with El Captain. If you want to do so (at your own risk) see Disable System Integrity Protection (rootless).\nIt's actually what they say on the link you've given :\n\nI believe this is from changes related to the new “rootless” or System Integrity Protection feature of El Capitan (more info). Whether it’s a bug or a feature is impossible to tell at this point. If it’s a bug, then that means Apple should be fixing it in a future point release, for example 10.11.1. If it’s a feature, they need to update their bless tool and remove the featureset entirely.\n\nThe rootless or System Integrity Protection is designed to deny app to edit system related files. The way that BootChamp works it that it uses the command bless to change the current booting disk. This doesn't work anymore with rootless enabled. Other softwares like Refind doesn't work anymore thanks to rootless. System Integrity Protection is there to prevent applications from damaging your computer. It's relatively safe to disable it, but make sure you know what apps are getting executed on your mac. \n\nA: *\n\n*Open System Preferences\n\n*Startup Disk\n\n*unlock the padlock (bottom left of the window) if is shows closed\n\n*Select the Windows OS\n\n*Press restart\n\n\nIf you enable UI scripting, you could automate that via Automator as well.\nLess good options would be to pick up a virtualization software package that lets you run from the BootCamp partition without needing to restart OS X. That would reduce the time to get into windows drastically at the cost of software and measurable but potentially negligible slow down in your performance.\n", "Q: iOS 9.0.1 Unknown Error (-42585) What is it? When I try to listen to music on iOS 9.0.1 sometimes an error code comes up. The error is:\n\nThe operation could not be completed\n  An unknown error occurred (-42585)\n\nWhat is it? What can I do to stop it? The music still works but this happens sometimes.\n\nA: There are a whole raft of obscure error messages where your primary recourse is to contact Apple Support.\nThey have access to the engineering team that can look up a specific error message and they also have the best database of user issues that I'm aware of and can search for others with that situation.\nYou can also pay attention to if you're playing an Apple Music radio stream, or an iTunes match streamed song or a song that's copied onto the iOS device over USB from iTunes. Any raft of server errors like bad ssl certificates, missing files on Apple's servers would result in oddball error messages until the system can be updated with proper english errors like try playing another song.\n"]
